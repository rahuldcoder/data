-- @entity1 , 54 , was beheaded by @entity2 during a surprise attack at a @entity5 plant in @entity6 last week , according to police			1
thankfully , before the terrorist -- yes , terrorist -- could behead another victim , @entity9 , he was shot by the company 's ceo , @entity10 , who is also a deputy sheriff			1
@entity1 , a wife , mother , and grandmother , did not			0
her husband of 25 years was outside @entity5 that afternoon , waiting to pick her up as he did every day , when he learned she was the victim of a terrorist attack			1
it was a terrorist attack , and everyone knows it			1
why wo n't the government say so ? the @entity20 reports that the @entity21 found " no indication that @entity23 was copying the beheadings of journalists in @entity26 by the @entity27 ... adding that they are treating this as an incident of workplace violence			1
" workplace violence ? you ca n't be serious ! oh wait -- the @entity21 must mean " workplace violence " as in the case of maj. @entity35 , the terrorist convicted in the 2009 @entity37 shooting that killed 13 people and left many more wounded			1
oh yeah , i remember that extremist attack carried out by a " soldier of @entity43 " -- but that 's just workplace violence			1
it does n't mean anything that @entity35 is writing letters from death row to @entity49 leader @entity48 , begging to become a citizen of the self - procaimed @entity27			1
just a guy who got angry at work			0
prosecutor likely to seek death penalty how dumb do you think we are ? @entity37 was an act of terrorism , the beheading of @entity1 was an act of terrorism , and it 's time the @entity21 , the president , and all of us started calling it that			2
first , it 's important to give this barbaric crime the label it begs for -- not just because of the charges it should carry and the punishment that should be handed down , but because it 's important , at every turn , to draw a very clear distinction between @entity49 extremists and the silent majority of @entity79 who are just as horrified as @entity81 more than 100 @entity83 clerics and scholars just condemned @entity49 , outlining in 17 pages why @entity49 ' actions are an " offense to @entity83 , @entity79 and to the entire world			1
" they , too , are unfairly tarnished with every barbaric , terrorist act performed in the name of their religion			0
second , it 's essential if we want to win the war on terror that we understand how technology has changed that war since 9/11			2
president @entity99 admitted that the @entity100 " underestimated " isis			0
and in his speech before the @entity102 , he described isis as a " network of death " that must be defeated			0
and this " network of death " has managed to reach beyond the confines of @entity26 and the @entity107			0
thanks to the barbaric beheading videos , @entity49 is in our living rooms and our news feeds and on our minds			2
and that 's exactly how @entity49 wants it			2
it makes those snuff videos precisely so we 'll watch and talk about it , and so terrorists like @entity2 will be inspired to perform acts of terrorism on @entity100 soil			2
you can try to downplay the connection to @entity49 by calling @entity2 a lone wolf , a copy cat or a nut case , but there is evidence of a very real connection these lone wolves feel to terrorists , and we 'd better stop ignoring it and passing it off as " workplace violence			1
" after @entity49 beheaded @entity81 @entity138 and @entity139 and @entity141 aid worker @entity140 , @entity137 terrorists kidnapped and beheaded @entity143 hiker @entity142			1
just last month @entity145 authorities uncovered and stopped an alleged terrorist plot to kidnap a random person who would be beheaded in a " demonstration killing			0
" @entity2 may not have been part of an active @entity49 cell waiting around to make a coordinated strike , but he is a terrorist who sympathized with and was inspired by @entity83 fundamentalist militants			1
just last week , an @entity49 leader , @entity153 , released a 42 - minute recorded speech directed toward " lone wolf " operations encouraging terrorists like @entity2			1
" do not ask for anyone 's advice and do not seek anyone 's verdict , kill the infidel whether he is civilian or military			0
" i do n't know if he watched this @entity49 recruitment video , but apparently @entity2 did watch beheading videos online			1
according to an article by @entity168 in @entity169 , in @entity170 posted one to his @entity172 page , under the pseudonym @entity174 , with the caption : " this do we find the clear precedent that explains the particular penchant of @entity83 terrorists to behead their victims , it is merely another precedent bestowed by their @entity183			0
" he also added a citation from the quran : " i will instill terror into the hearts of the @entity189 ; smite ye about their necks			0
" " @entity196 " means a heavy blow or stroke with a weapon			0
the terrorist who killed @entity1 " smote " her neck when he cut it , reportedly with the same knife he used to slice produce when he worked at @entity5			0
according to @entity168 , @entity2 posted photos of @entity203 , other jihadis , and the @entity206 burning			0
the @entity207 reported he wrote : " she ( the @entity209 ) is going into flames			0
she and anybody who 's with her			0
" he posted photos of a woman being flogged , @entity168 wrote , with the words " @entity83 will dominate the world			2
@entity217 can go to hell			0
" there 's nothing but evidence that @entity2 was copying the @entity49 beheadings in @entity26			1
so let 's drop the political correctness for once and call the @entity6 beheading what it is -- terrorism .			2

@entity228 : woman beheaded in @entity6 is victim of terrorist attack
she says @entity21 calls it workplace violence , but there 's evidence of @entity2 's focus on @entity49
she says *denying* this *avoids* new realities in war on terror : it 's online , can affect us at home
we risk tarnishing @entity83 - @entity81 , *overwhelmingly* peace - loving , she says
