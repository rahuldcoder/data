-- when @entity2 recently announced that it would install inflight @entity3 on all its mainline aircraft beginning next year , it might not have seemed like a big deal			1
after all , airlines have had @entity3 on board for a couple of years now and it has become quite common			2
this , however , is different			0
this is the first effort by a @entity12 airline to provide @entity3 on intercontinental flights			1
you might recognize @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity12 , @entity17 and @entity18 as airlines that have been aggressively installing @entity3 aboard their aircraft over the last few years			1
those airlines , however , are constrained by geography because of the system they use			2
all those carriers contract with @entity27 to be their internet provider , and @entity27 transmits its signals from the ground : it has stations all over the @entity12 that allow aircraft to connect to the @entity3			1
but these are n't installed in the water , so fairly soon after you go " feet wet " on your flight , the @entity3 stops working			2
airlines like this system because it 's easy to install ( it can be done overnight on an airplane ) , the system is relatively inexpensive and the bandwidth is cheap			0
that makes for a winning combination , but it does have constraints			0
that 's why @entity2 is going a different route			2
@entity2 is installing satellite - based @entity3 on its airplanes			1
as long as the aircraft is in range of the satellite , then @entity3 can flow freely			1
@entity2 is far from the first airline to do this			1
in fact , @entity55 has been installing satellite internet for a while now as well , but there is one big issue			1
the problem with satellite - based internet in general is that it 's more expensive			1
you would expect that to be the case -- satellites do n't come cheap			0
there are also considerations about the amount of weight added to the aircraft from the antenna , the cost and the amount of time it takes to do an install ( longer than the overnight required by @entity27 )			0
@entity79 's luxury offices in the sky airlines have been hesitant to sink a lot of money into something that , so far , has n't seen much usage			0
though reports are spotty , most airlines have hinted at single - digit percentage usage on aircraft			0
some see more , like @entity18 and its more tech - savvy demographic , but in general , it 's not a lot			0
@entity2 , however , is making a bet that it will catch on in greater numbers and it will be an important amenity			2
how much will it cost you , the traveler ? we do n't know , because @entity2 has n't said anything			2
but we can look at its partner airline @entity101 to get an idea of how other long - haul airlines are pricing the same system			0
when you fly @entity101 today , you can pay â ‚ ¬ 10.95 for one hour ( about $ 15 ) or â ‚ ¬ 19.95 for 24 hours ( about $ 27 )			0
@entity2 will certainly come up with its own pricing , but this gives you a sense of what you 're looking at			0
five extraordinary airport lounges now that @entity2 has made the move , we have to wait and see if others will follow			0
a @entity17 spokesperson says the airline is " reviewing international connectivity options for our customers but ( we ) do n't have further details at this time			0
" it might not actually be @entity2 's move that pushes others to offer long - haul @entity3 but rather technological advances			1
last month , a new satellite was launched into space , and it will provide faster , cheaper @entity3			1
( it uses a different technology than the service @entity2 has signed up with for its long - haul flights )			1
@entity127 subsidiary @entity126 has been offering this option , and @entity127 itself will begin installing it on its fleet next year			0
will @entity17 and @entity12 eventually fall in line and put @entity3 on their long haul fleets ? i would imagine so , but when it happens and with what technology still remains to be seen .			1

united to become first @entity12 airline to provide @entity3 on intercontinental flights
@entity140 is already available on many *domestic* flights but is constrained by geography
@entity2 is installing satellite - based @entity3 on its planes , a more expensive option
