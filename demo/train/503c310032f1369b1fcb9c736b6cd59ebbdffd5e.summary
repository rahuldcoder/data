-- a robotic recycling system could help address the escalating global waste problem , according to @entity4 technology company @entity3			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) is an intelligent robotic system which separates construction materials on a conveyer belt , plucking out recyclable materials and depositing them in bins for collection			1
the system is designed to replace manual sorting , which can be dangerous and frequently prohibitively expensive			1
worldwide , the construction and demolition sector is thought to contribute over one third of all waste			1
the @entity18 alone contributes a staggering 325 million tons of waste every year , and the @entity20 produces another 120 million tons			2
while household and municipal waste has fallen in recent years across the developed world , @entity21 -- a not - for - profit sustainability organization based in the @entity20 -- suggests that over 80 % of all human waste that potentially could be recycled currently goes into landfill			2
@entity3 founder @entity28 notes that the problem is equally severe across the @entity30 : " in the @entity30 alone there 's 900 million tons of construction and demolition waste			1
if you were to convert that to the average sized car , the queue would go 45 times around the globe			0
" @entity28 and his team at @entity3 constructed the @entity5 to help deal with this problem			0
" it 's a really difficult job for robots and machine learning systems to do , " says @entity28			0
" there are currently no such systems in the world , so our system is the first			2
" the @entity5 identifies different types of waste using a process called " sensor fusion			2
" by analysing the data , the sensors sort through objects on a conveyor belt and distribute them into surrounding chutes			2
the sensor fusion system uses a range of technologies including weight measurement , @entity64 scanning , tactile assessment and spectrometer analysis , which measures how much light reflects from various different materials			1
@entity3 believes its creation will help ease the burden of the repetitive and dangerous job of waste filtration , which is currently done manually			2
" currently , construction and demolition waste is handled by manual pickers , " says @entity28			1
" that 's a pretty good solution , but it 's hazardous for your health			0
there are poisonous materials , sharp and heavy materials , plus asbestos etc. " @entity28 says that the idea for using robots for recycling came to him when he had stayed up late watching a documentary on the @entity88 , in which a @entity90 bomber was crushed and recycled			0
the waste was placed onto a conveyor belt attended to by " bored - looking " employees picking through the rubble			0
@entity28 says he immediately noticed two things : " first of all it 's really dangerous to be there because the process is really hazardous ( and ) second that the technology ( we ) had was a perfect fit			0
so we decided to do robotic sorting			0
" the @entity5 's sensor fusion system works through a complex analysis procedure conducted once items are put onto the conveyor belt			0
the system 's sensors gather data , which is sent across to the bespoke artificial intelligence system , christened by the team as the " @entity112			0
" the brain assesses each object 's material ( wood , metal , stone , etc. ) and decides what to do with it			0
commands are then issued to the robotic arm , which picks up the objects and deposits them in the appropriate bin , ready for collection			1
renowned industrial designer @entity128 says he believes the robot could contribute to global efforts to improve recycling , but adds that the real problem is something significantly more fundamental : " there should be less waste for us to have to sort to begin with			1
" @entity128 says that inventions such as the @entity5 robot raise important questions about global waste : " human beings have a lot to think about here -- how we pack things , how we wrap things up and how we use materials			1
