-- @entity2 presidential hopeful @entity1 has scored the endorsement of @entity4 , who lauded the former @entity6 governor in an ad sunday in @entity10 's the @entity9 newspaper			1
the public endorsement comes one day after the @entity9 -- @entity10 's largest newspaper -- backed @entity1 in his bid for the @entity2 presidential nomination and just over two weeks before @entity10 's critical presidential caucuses on january 3			1
in his advertisement , @entity4 said @entity1 is the @entity2 candidate is best suited to defeat president @entity18 in 2012			2
" i 've known @entity1 and his family for decades			0
his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic , rock - solid conservative values , and a deep sense of service to others , " the former @entity21 senator and 1996 @entity2 presidential nominee wrote			0
" these traits -- which have shone through in both the debates and in my own visits with him -- will serve him well in the @entity33			0
" @entity4 also said @entity1 " rescued a flailing @entity34 when it was mired in financial scandal			2
" and as governor of @entity6 , @entity4 wrote , @entity1 " managed to both balance the state 's budget and cut taxes while dealing with an overwhelmingly @entity41 state legislature			1
" the @entity9 's editorial board said @entity1 was the most qualified candidate competing in the caucuses			1
while the paper did n't endorse @entity1 during his last run for president in 2007 , the editorial board said voters now face a different @entity2 field and @entity1 " has matured as a candidate			1
" " rebuilding the economy is the nation 's top priority , and @entity1 makes the best case among the @entity2 that he could do that , " the editorial board wrote			1
the board hailed @entity1 for his " solid credentials , " saying he was the most likely candidate to see through " knee - jerk , ideological " perspectives and " bridge the political divide in @entity62			2
" taking issue with the two other top - tier candidates , the paper claimed @entity1 stood out against former house speaker @entity66 , whom the board called " an undisciplined partisan who would alienate , not unite , if he reverts to mean - spirited attacks on display as @entity33 speaker			1
" it also criticized @entity74 rep. @entity73 as someone with a libertarian ideology that would " lead to economic chaos and isolationism			0
" also significant , the board somewhat defended @entity1 against a line of attack taken by opponents who criticize him as a " flip - flopper			2
" " though @entity1 has tended to adapt some positions to different times and places , he is hardly unique			0
it should be possible for a politician to say , ' i was wrong , and i have changed my mind ' , " the paper wrote			0
but the paper still reserved questions over his changing tune on issues such as abortion and said it was up to the voters to decide " whether such subtly nuanced statements express @entity1 's true beliefs or if he 's trying to have it both ways			1
" while the paper 's endorsement is highly coveted , it does not necessarily spell success for a candidate			1
in the last election cycle , the paper endorsed @entity2 sen. @entity110 of @entity111 , who did n't actively campaign in the state and took third place in the caucuses , while former @entity116 gov. @entity115 pulled off a surprise victory			0
the newspaper has long endorsed candidates for the general presidential election , but it began making endorsements for the caucuses in 1988			0
since then , three of its choices went on to win the contest : @entity4 in 1996 and 1988 and then - @entity74 gov. @entity126 in 2000			2
in addition , three endorsees eventually secured the @entity2 nomination : @entity4 in 1996 , @entity126 in 2000 and @entity110 in 2008			0
only one of its chosen candidates - @entity126 in 2000 - went on to win the @entity33			0
according to an @entity134 poll taken dec. 8 - 11 , @entity1 placed second in the @entity10 with 17 % of support among likely caucus voters , while @entity137 took first with 22 %			1
@entity73 tied with @entity1 at 17 % on friday , @entity1 garnered a nod from @entity140 @entity139 gov. @entity139			1
@entity140 's primary , set for january 21 , is the first presidential contest in the @entity140 and the third overall in the early voting season			0
@entity0 's @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

the two endorsements come about two weeks before the @entity10 caucus
@entity4 and the @entity9 's editorial board *praise* @entity1 's credentials
the paper 's support is coveted , but a number of previous picks have not won the @entity33
