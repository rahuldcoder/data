no politician in @entity1 can draw a crowd like @entity3			1
thousands of @entity4 filled a freezing @entity5 sunday , cheering for the former president - turned - prime - minister as he celebrated election again to the nation 's highest office and delivered a patriotic speech			1
" we are appealing to all people to unite for our people , for our motherland , and we will win , " he said			2
" we 've had a victory ! glory to @entity1 ! " the 59 - year - old former @entity17 agent and law student has dominated @entity1 politics for more than a decade			1
he served two terms as president from 2000 to 2008 , then most recently served as prime minister under current president @entity23			0
in september , @entity23 called on the ruling @entity25 party to endorse @entity3 for president once again -- and @entity3 , for his part , suggested @entity23 should take over the role of prime minister			1
in that vote , however , although @entity25 held on to power it saw its number of parliamentary seats significantly decreased			0
the balloting sparked ongoing protests and allegations of vote - rigging directed at @entity3 , and fueled speculation that his sway over @entity1 politics might be diminishing			1
@entity3 's critics focused on attempting to end his political career			2
but that seems unlikely following the election of march 4			0
with more than two - thirds of the vote counted , @entity3 was leading his closest rival by an almost 4 - 1 margin , dashing hopes of opponents that he could receives less than 50 % and be forced into a runoff vote			1
@entity3 faced four other presidential contenders , including @entity1 's third - richest man , @entity51 owner @entity50			1
human rights groups say civil liberties and democratic freedoms have suffered during @entity3 's rule			2
former world chess champion @entity56 is among @entity3 's critics			2
" i think if anybody told us in august 1991 that nine years later , the country would be run by a @entity17 lieutenant colonel , this person would look like a laughingstock , " @entity56 has said			0
@entity3 , the married father of two daughters , rose from humble beginnings to become one of @entity1 's most powerful men			1
he was born in @entity67 ( then @entity67 ) , the son of a factory foreman , and raised in a communal apartment shared by three families			0
he joined the @entity17 in 1975 and later was selected to attend the @entity72 , where he learned both @entity73 and @entity74			0
he was briefly assigned to counterintelligence duties in what was then @entity77 before moving back to @entity67 , where he was assistant rector for international affairs at @entity80			0
he left the @entity17 in 1992 , and served several posts in @entity67 's government before accepting a job as deputy business manager for the @entity85 in 1996 , then head of the @entity88 and @entity87 of the @entity89 under @entity90			0
when @entity90 resigned in 1999 , @entity3 -- then acting prime minister -- was appointed acting president			2
he was elected to the office the following year			0
he has received credit for consolidating @entity95 and bringing stability to the nation			0
he 's also demonstrated a talent for self - promotion			0
television viewers have seen him riding horseback without a shirt ; on a motorcycle ; diving ; flying an aircraft ; and demonstrating his judo skills ( he holds a black belt )			0
" he 's an extremely charismatic person , " said @entity3 spokesman @entity107			2
" he 's a tough guy , but he 's a very balanced guy			0
he 's a predictable guy , and he 's a constructive guy			0
" @entity1 's youth back @entity3 in droves , singing songs praising him and even getting tattoos of his face			1
the @entity115 youth group @entity116 , meaning " ours " in @entity1 , was formed in 2005 by the @entity25 party to promote patriotism and support for the @entity121 and for @entity3			1
but other youth are opposed to @entity3 and not buying into the cult of personality			1
during a nearly four - hour question - and - answer session @entity3 held last year on state television , the @entity1 word for " @entity129 " was trending on @entity128 , and rumors persist that @entity3 appears younger , possibly with medical intervention			1
" one should n't react closely to rumors , " @entity107 said			0
" the less you react to rumors , the less they appear			0
" @entity3 's campaign this time was deliberately low - key -- he sent proxies to televised debates -- but he still appears daily on state television			1
a primary focus of his campaign had been modernizing @entity1 's military , saying it 's the only way to improve @entity1 standing and clout in the world			2
he 's proposed spending 23 trillion rubles ( about $ 768 billion ) on the military and the defense industry over the next 10 years			0
while he has n't said where the money is coming from , @entity3 has maintained that @entity1 ca n't afford not to spend it			1
still , @entity3 's critics show no sign of disappearing			2
@entity155 , a former @entity156 ambassador to @entity4 , said last week that he believes the @entity121 has been " taken aback by the degree of opposition " -- so much so , he said , that it 's conceivable that a reported assassination plot targeting @entity3 may have been a scheme to build support for him			1
" there was a similar alleged plot against him the election before last , " said @entity155 , who is now a @entity1 expert at the @entity164 - based think tank @entity163			1
" ... it 's conceivable , but it seems improbable			0
" @entity155 said ahead of sunday 's vote that even if @entity3 won , " it wo n't necessarily mean he has strong and durable support			1

@entity3 has dominated @entity1 politics for more than a decade
with more than two - thirds of the count in , he is expected to win the election
he makes *frequent* television appearances and *enjoys* strong youth support
