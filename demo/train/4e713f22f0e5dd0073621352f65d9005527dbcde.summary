the only problem is attaining one of these stylish items has traditionally required a shed - load of cash preceded by a healthy dose of success -- but that is n't necessarily the case anymore			2
an increasing number of people are pooling their resources to buy up and then share grandiose luxury products like yachts and private jets through fractional ownership initiatives			1
