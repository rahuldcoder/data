@entity0 , @entity1 -- for one trapped miner in a collapsed mine in @entity1 , " @entity5 " weighs only 7 pounds			1
@entity6 , which means hope in @entity8 , is the name of @entity11 's baby girl			1
she is also believed to be the first child born to any of the 33 miners during their nightmarish weeks buried underground			2
@entity6 was born tuesday in a hospital about an hour 's drive down a winding mountain road from the mine where her father is trapped			1
@entity11 and his wife , @entity21 , learned they were having a girl the day before the mine cave - in			1
they had planned to call her @entity27			0
the girl 's birth was not just a celebration for @entity33 , his father said			1
" immediately it gave all the miners there a lot of excitement , " @entity34 said			0
" they were all very happy about her birth and that she will be called @entity6			1
" the day after the birth , @entity34 carried @entity1 newspapers he was saving for his son with front - page photos of @entity21 holding the new baby			1
the story of the baby 's birth has been reported as far away as @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 , and @entity6 has become a symbol that life continues for the miners despite their underground imprisonment			1
photos released from their hospital room showed a tiny baby , her eyes shut tight and with no idea that she is already famous at birth			1
the decision to change her name arrived to @entity11 in the mine 's depths			2
that all the miners had survived the cave - in and then the 17 days it took rescuers to drill the holes that found them was already miraculous			2
but their continued physical and mental well - being was far from assured			2
faced with the fact that he and his fellow workers were about to experience an isolating darkness that no one had ever endured before , @entity11 put pen to paper			0
the letter he wrote reached his family through what the @entity1 call " palomas , " metal tubes that carry food , supplies and messages to the trapped men			1
" he said , ' what if we call her @entity5 ? ' " @entity34 recalled			0
" @entity5 for the camp backing us , hope for getting us out of here , hope to keep fighting for my daughter , hope to unite my family			1
' " @entity11 's wife agreed to the new name			1
for her , though , the experience would be a tug of war between worrying for her unborn child and for her trapped husband			1
" i have been talking to her and telling her @entity109 's ok , " @entity21 told @entity2 a few weeks before she gave birth			1
" i ca n't cry because she would feel everything			0
" before the mine collapse , @entity11 promised @entity21 he would be in the room when she gave birth			2
he had not been present for the births of their two sons , one time because he wanted to watch a beloved soccer team play and the other time because of " squeamishness , " @entity21 said			0
@entity21 decided to have the birth of their daughter videotaped			2
but videotaping a natural birth was against hospital policy			2
so , to get around the policy , she had a caesarean section on camera			0
family members say mother and daughter have been released from the hospital and are doing fine			2
over a video conference system that is one of their links to the outside world , @entity11 was shown the birth of his daughter , deep in the mine			2
" we sent the video and @entity11 was very happy , " engineer @entity142 said			0
" it was a very beautiful moment for them			0
" around @entity147 , the encampment that runs up the entrance to the mine where many families have moved to wait out the miners ' rescue , word of @entity6 's birth brought joy			1
as she sat in a light blue tent at @entity147 , @entity156 said it is a joy she hopes to experience herself soon			0
her son , trapped miner @entity160 , and his wife also are expecting a daughter			1
when the girl is born in six months ' time , @entity156 said , the couple has decided to call her @entity167 , or @entity168			0
" i am going to be a father , " @entity156 said her son wrote her			0
" i am happiest man in the world even though i am in the depths of the earth			0
i want to share this happiness with everyone in the world , with you , @entity178 , and my brothers			0
" @entity156 said her son has been " reborn			0
" " he wrote me , " she said , " that even in the deepest part of the earth there shines light			0
" @entity2 's @entity185 and @entity186 contributed reporting to this article .			0
