-- when it comes to comedy , the @entity1 are making room for " girls			1
" " girls , " the polarizing @entity7 comedy about four twentysomething women finding their way in 21st - century @entity10 , received five nods thursday when the nominations for the @entity13 were announced			1
among the show 's nominations were picks for best comedy series as well as best actress in a comedy for creator and writer @entity22			1
" girls " joined fellow newcomer " @entity25 " as well as comedy mainstays " @entity34 " -- which led all comedy series with 14 nominations -- " @entity29 " ( 13 nods ) , " @entity31 " and " @entity32 " among comedy series nominees			1
" family " won the category last year			0
several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series , including " @entity40 " -- which has won this category four years running -- " @entity42 , " " @entity43 " and " @entity44			1
" @entity46 ' breakout hit " @entity48 , " which was nominated in the miniseries category last year , joined the crew for best drama , as did @entity52 's " @entity51			2

@entity68 led broadcast networks with 60 nominations			2
" girls " has divided both critics and viewers			1
some have dismissed the show for its narrow take on @entity10 and young women , noting the lack of @entity80 characters , its general hip and upscale settings , and @entity22 's willingness to make her audience squirm as she follows characters into both bedroom and bathroom			0
the show 's defenders , on the other hand , applaud @entity22 for showing her characters in less - than - flattering lights and observe that " girls " is n't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum			1
indeed , " @entity99 " -- to which @entity22 's show has been compared -- also showed a thin slice of @entity10 through the lives of four women ( and much more glamorously , to boot )			0
the nominations were n't without their perceived snubs			2
despite both critical acclaim and a growing audience , @entity106 's fx series " @entity107 " did n't make the cut for comedy series , though the comedian - writer - @entity113 guy did receive a nod for best actor in a comedy			1
@entity122 's " @entity121 " missed out on best comedy series as well , though star @entity119 got a nomination			1
@entity122 's self - referential sitcom " @entity129 , " a critical darling that was the subject of heated controversy when the show 's creator , @entity126 , was forced out as executive producer in may , got just one nomination , for writing			2
marquee : the nominees list however , there were also some surprises			0
@entity136 , whose @entity52 series " @entity138 " received an uneven reception upon its january premiere , earned a nomination for best actor in a comedy series			2
" homeland , " about a @entity154 agent combating terrorism and her own demons , received plenty of attention , picking up nine nominations , including nods for best drama series and stars @entity150 and @entity151			1
" it 's an incredible thrill to be nominated our first year out			0
when we wrote the pilot , we never imagined that the @entity163 would include us in the company of such extraordinary nominees , " " @entity51 's " co-creators @entity159 and @entity160 said in a statement			0
and the ageless @entity166 ( ok , she 's actually 90 ) was nominated for best reality show host for " @entity166 's off their rockers			0
" ( her comedy series , " hot in @entity171 , " also got recognition , with two nominations			1
) the prize for best drama series , usually considered the night 's capstone , looks to be a wide - open race			1
though " @entity40 " has won it four consecutive years , @entity179 's " @entity43 , " featuring @entity182 's best actor - nominated performance as a chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin , is coming off a strong year , and " @entity48 " offers a rich and sumptuous take on early 20th - century life			2
moreover , " thrones , " based on @entity189 's best - selling fantasy novels , " homeland " and " @entity191 " all have their partisans			0
the nominations were announced by @entity195 , star of @entity197 's " scandal , " and late - night host @entity198			2
@entity198 , who stepped in for " @entity121 " actor @entity199 at the last minute ( @entity199 suffered travel delays ) , showed up in pajamas			0
