@entity0 -- viewers may have to get used to a steady stream of reruns now that television and film writers have gone on strike			1
members of the @entity10 manned picket lines monday morning outside @entity13 studios at @entity14 , carrying signs and yelling , on the first day of the @entity10 's strike against studios and production companies			1
@entity19 and comedy shows , including " @entity21 with @entity22 , " " the @entity23 with @entity24 " and " @entity25 , " have announced they 'll air reruns monday night and until further notice			1
if the strike continues , it could affect soap operas and prime - time television programs as well			1
" i support them , " @entity22 said of the writers			2
" people get the wrong idea about how much writers make			2
" watch @entity22 back striking writers » the writers ' union says the strike , which began at 12:01 a.m. @entity40 ( 3:01 a.m. et ) , is necessary to protect their members ' future incomes as the shows they write are increasingly distributed over new media , primarily through internet downloading			1
a last - day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed sunday night despite the writers conceding a demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for dvd sales			1
this had been considered the major stumbling block to a deal			0
" the @entity57 situation has always been a catastrophe , " @entity59 , the executive producer of @entity13 's " @entity60 : @entity61 , " said monday			2
but , he stressed , " at the moment , we have no piece of the @entity66 at all			0
" watch what 's at stake » while studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike , some television shows that are more topical -- particularly late - night tv talk shows -- are expected to immediately go to reruns			1
watch " @entity77 's " @entity76 talk about the issues » " it 's affecting us in the most visible way possible , " @entity79 , a writer and correspondent for " @entity81 , " told @entity1 on monday as he stood amid the pickets , who carried signs that read " @entity85 " and " @entity86			1
" the group had also brought a large inflatable rat , which they had tethered to metal railings set up along the street			0
" we 're off the air , " @entity79 said			0
" we 'd much rather work than stand in the cold			0
writers are people who fear the sunlight , " he added , smiling			2
however , he said , the writers need new contracts that incorporate new media 's impact			1
" clearly , revenue is being created " from new media , he said , " but we are not receiving any of it			2
" in @entity105 , @entity106 , writers marched monday outside @entity107 , carrying signs and shouting over traffic and honks from supporters			2
dozens more picketed outside @entity13 studios in @entity113 , @entity106 on sunday night , the president of the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) criticized the @entity10 negotiators for walking out of the talks			2
" when we asked if they would ' stop the clock ' for the purpose of delaying the strike to allow negotiations to continue , they refused , " said @entity115 president @entity118			2
the union 's statement early monday morning said that while it chose to withdraw its dvd proposal -- which they say would have doubled writers ' residuals -- the studios and production companies were still insisting on a framework concerning internet distribution that " makes a mockery of any residual , " the statement said			1
the @entity10 said producers want to deny the union future jurisdiction over scripts written for most new media and have offered no economic proposal for the parts of new media writing the guild wants covered			2
other rules demanded by producers would give writers no residuals when a movie is streamed online or during a " window " when online consumers have free reuse of downloads , the @entity10 said			1
counter placed the blamed for the failed talks on the negotiators for the writers			0
" we made an attempt at meeting them in a number of their key areas , including @entity66 streaming and jurisdiction in new media , " @entity118 said			0
" ultimately , the guild was unwilling to compromise on most of their major demands			0
" while working writers are generally paid well , they depend on residuals to get them through often - frequent times of unemployment			1
and , as video ipods and @entity66 downloads increasingly supplant traditional television and movie theaters , writers confront a changing industry			0
reality television has been another wake - up call for writers , since most do not require scripts			1
" @entity187 " and other hit shows should not be affected by a prolonged strike			1
@entity115 said that 67 percent -- 64 of 96 -- television series this season are scripted , down from 81 percent just two seasons ago			0
late - night television hosts like @entity24 , @entity22 and @entity192 , as well as programs like " @entity81 , " are feeling the pinch of the strike first			1
because of their topical nature , networks do not typically shoot these shows in advance			0
daytime soaps normally stockpile about 30 days in advance and most prime - time shows would likely make it through the end of the year without any major impact on programming			1
a spokeswoman for the guild , @entity208 , told @entity1 on monday that the strike would not affect news divisions			0
but networks would have to resort to reruns , news programs and reality shows to fill the schedule in 2008 if a strike were to drag on			1
if the strike lingers , the @entity10 faces the danger of writers opting out of full membership for " financial core " status , which would allow them to return to work			1
they would lose their voting privileges , but retain all benefits			0
the last @entity10 strike 20 years ago lasted five and a half months			0
it cost the entertainment industry an estimated $ 500 million			0
