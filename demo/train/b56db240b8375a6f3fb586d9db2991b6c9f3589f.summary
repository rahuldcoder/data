-- the killing last weekend of a catholic priest and two seminary students in southwest @entity3 marked the first time that drug cartel hit men have purposefully targeted a clergyman , said @entity8 , public relations secretary for @entity3 's @entity9			1
the rev. @entity10 , 39 , was gunned down as he traveled in a vehicle in the town of @entity13 in the state of @entity15 , together with two seminary students , @entity17 , 19 , and @entity18 , 21			0
" in this case the drug traffickers followed them and ambushed them , " said @entity8 , who declined to name which cartel is suspected behind the incident			1
authorities have not stated a motive in the case , but @entity8 said one line of investigation is that one of the seminary students had a family member involved with a drug cartel , and that the three were killed as revenge for some cause			1
at least seven priests have been killed in @entity3 since 2005 under violent circumstances , including being kidnapped , shot and beaten			1
organized crime has been suspected in some of these cases , but saturday 's killing in @entity15 left no doubt of the perpetrators ' business , @entity8 said			1
@entity44 and the two seminarians had just celebrated @entity46 in @entity13 and were leaving the area when a group of unknown gunmen pulled up next to their vehicle and opened fire , according to the local human rights organization @entity53			0
local reports added that after shooting the priest 's vehicle , the gunmen pulled the men outside and shot them in the back			0
the incident paralyzed area residents to the point that no one in the town would go to identify the bodies , @entity53 reported			0
the three victims remained " unknown " until someone from out of town came to officially identify them			0
since taking office in 2006 , @entity3 president @entity68 has made the fight against drug cartels a priority			1
he has dispatched more than 25,000 troops to augment local police forces			0
last year , drug violence was blamed for the deaths of 78 @entity3 soldiers and more than 6,000 others			1
this year , the drug violence has claimed more than 2,900 lives , according to the newspaper @entity81			0
the clergy has not been spared from the spike in drug - related violence that has afflicted regions of @entity3 , @entity8 said			1
" the threats are not new , " he said			0
" as drug trafficking continued to grow , from about 2004 on , the priests continued to denounce it , and they themselves were threatened			2
" in april , the archbishop of the northern state of @entity93 raised fears of attacks on the clergy after he said that @entity3 's most wanted man , @entity98 boss @entity97 " @entity97 , lives in a @entity93 town and that " everybody knows it except the authorities			1
" the comment , which was made in private conversation , stirred fears of retaliation and the archbishop backed off his statement after it quickly spread			0
of the 15,000 priests in @entity3 , @entity8 estimated that 1,000 had been threatened in some form , and that 300 priests have been threatened directly			1
those direct threats -- usually in the form of " shut up , or we 'll shut you up " -- have come from intermediaries for organized crime or anonymously , @entity8 said			2
the threats against the clergy have been serious enough that in some 20 cases , priests in @entity3 were transferred to other parishes out of regard for their safety , he said			1
the targeting of a priest is significant because it marks another boundary crossed by drug cartels , @entity8 said			2
bishops have noted that in surveys they conduct with families in their dioceses , drug dealing and domestic drug use top the list of problems families face , whereas three or five years ago it did n't make the list			0
as enforcement action in @entity3 and the @entity143 has increased , domestic drug consumption in @entity3 has increased			2
domestic drug use has torn families apart and made the new generation of traffickers more violent and less respectful of institutions like the church , @entity8 said			1
but these same traffickers who threaten priests are paradoxically the same people that the church wants to reach			2
" rebuilding the social fabric has been a mission of the church , " @entity8 said			0
" we ca n't live in fear			0
" another notable killing , the 1993 murder of @entity160 cardinal @entity159 , has been attributed by some as a case of mistaken identity by drug traffickers , though church officials have publicly expressed doubts that the killers were traffickers			2
the state of @entity15 , known for its beach destination of @entity170 , in recent years has been the setting of turf wars over drug trafficking routes between the @entity175 cartel , the @entity98 , and an organization known as @entity177 .			0

@entity180 's murder crosses a line , says @entity8 of @entity3 's @entity9
of 15,000 priests in @entity3 , 1,000 have been threatened by traffickers , @entity8 says
clergy have long denounced drug world , but now have become targets themselves
