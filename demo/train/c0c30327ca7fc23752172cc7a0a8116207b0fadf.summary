-- " @entity1 , " came the text			2
" @entity4 ( @entity5 ) off at @entity6 , " it meant			1
a friend from the @entity8 sent it			2
" hahaha , " the next text heckled			2
" @entity11 & @entity12 spent $ $ $ & still stink ! " if you say so , i said			2
" @entity16 , " it continued			2
ok , ok , i got it			2
this joker -- i guess others out there , too -- gets a weird satisfaction out of @entity6 's teams being so rich but playing so poorly			1
the digs do keep coming			2
@entity24 : " the @entity11 have lost seven straight			2
they 're so bad , they 've changed ' @entity27 ' to ' @entity28 in @entity29			1
' " then it became eight straight			2
@entity24 : " president @entity31 wants to close @entity32			2
@entity32 ? how about closing @entity33 ? how many people are being tortured there night after night ? " a funny thing happened on the way to a @entity38 here in smug , smoggy , sunny , show - me - the - money @entity41			1
our big - buck teams are playing 99 @entity45 ball			1
in fact , all of @entity41 is in the midst of some kind of too - big - to - fail madness			1
we 've got more flops than @entity52			1
we spent like @entity53 at a @entity55 plastic surgeons			2
but what did it get us so far ? losers across the board			2
i ca n't figure it out			2
where did @entity6 go wrong ? @entity63 : what @entity16 need for next year the @entity16 were loaded			1
@entity65 and @entity66 joined a team that already had @entity68 and @entity69			2
it could be the best team of all time ! it could win 75 of its 82 games ! @entity75 , get out of their way ! the @entity12 reloaded			0
they already had the mighty @entity77 and the cool kid @entity78			0
oh , so how about we go get @entity80 , too ? a murderers ' row ! see you in october ! the @entity11 recovered			0
they were bankrupt , then were bought up -- by @entity83 and friends -- for more than $ 2 billion , yet ! let 's go shopping ! @entity86 , ka - ching			1
@entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , ka - ching			1
@entity92 , ka - ching			1
money is no object ! it 's time for @entity11 ! well , so far , so bad			1
@entity63 : first quarter grade for @entity11 @entity16 : an 0 - 8 preseason and 1 - 4 start get the coach canned			1
a replacement is hired while much - loved @entity101 is still mulling it over			1
much - loved owner dr. @entity102 dies from cancer			1
@entity65 's hurt , @entity66 hurt , @entity68 hurt , @entity105 hurt			0
the new coach is not much - loved			1
fans chant : " we want @entity101 ! " lakers use players in the playoffs who are named who , @entity113 and @entity112			0
they lose a game by 31 points -- worst home playoff loss ever			0
@entity65 gets ejected from @entity118			0
the season ends and @entity68 sues his mom for selling his memorabilia			0
get me @entity123 or @entity124			0
have i got a sitcom for you			0
angels : a week into the season , ace pitcher @entity128 breaks his elbow			0
@entity12 lose eight of first 10 games			0
@entity77 , a slow start			0
@entity80 , a slower than slow start			0
the dependable @entity136 gets traded to @entity137 -- where he 's hot			0
the expendable @entity138 gets traded to @entity139 -- where he 's hotter than hot			0
as of may 16 , only the hopeless @entity140 have won fewer games in the @entity142 than the stars - @entity12 have			1
@entity11 : a week into the season , ace pitcher @entity92 breaks his collarbone			0
not a lot to smile about at @entity33 except a @entity149 pitcher named @entity150 who looks good and a @entity149 entertainer named @entity152 who comes to a game to dance in the aisles between innings while a wide - eyed @entity156 looks at him like he 's a man from @entity157			1
as of may 16 , our two billion dollar men are in last place			0
call @entity161 : @entity6 something 's killing our teams			1
not that we do n't appreciate the @entity164 and @entity165 winning championships in hockey and soccer the way they have			0
i just do n't get a lot of texts that go , " wow , @entity6 sure does have big - name hockey stars ! " or : " whoa , i 've got @entity165 fever ! " we 've seen our more famous teams go from good to bad			1
@entity180 football finally got off @entity182 probation , had star quarterback @entity183 back , was ranked no. 1 in the nation in a preseason poll -- then went 7 - 6 , embarrassed itself in a bowl game and saw @entity183 disappear on @entity189			1
@entity191 basketball christened a remodeled arena , brought in blue - chip recruit @entity193 , looked ok -- then lost by 20 points in the @entity182 tournament to @entity197 and fired the coach			1
things turned so dark , we even turned our dials to @entity202 's @entity201 -- yep , the @entity203 -- to save our city			0
i mean , come on			0
expecting a championship from the @entity203 is like expecting @entity206 to end up on a 10 best - dressed list			1
but there they were , @entity6 's new darlings , winning 16 games in a row , dunking and funking , popularizing the cool name " @entity213 , " doing tv ads for cars and stuff , having a 50 - win season for the first time , winning the @entity75 's @entity218 for the first time , winning two playoff games -- mmmm , kiss my red clips , baby ! then they blew games 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 and kissed off the whole year			1
well , what does n't kill you makes you stronger , as @entity227 likes to scream on @entity228			0
ok , so @entity229 does n't want to kick soccer balls for us anymore			0
ok , so the @entity189 still wo n't give us a team			0
ok , so the @entity234 horse - race track is shutting down for good			1
besides , baseball season 's still early			0
i would n't count out those @entity11 or @entity12 of ours just yet			0
they 've got $ $ $			1
if u think they stink , hey , go text yourself .			0
