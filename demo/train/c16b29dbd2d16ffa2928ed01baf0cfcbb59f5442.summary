-- the sultanate of @entity2 is a rarity in the diplomatic world : it enjoys " cordial " relations with both the @entity7 and @entity8			1
and once again , it is closely involved in trying to help win the freedom of @entity7 held in @entity8			1
in 2010 , @entity2 sources paid $ 500,000 bail to help win the release of @entity7 hiker @entity14 , who with her @entity15 © @entity14 and @entity14 was detained in 2009 after allegedly straying across an unmarked stretch of the @entity8 - @entity18 border			1
the @entity2 are now involved in brokering the release of @entity14 and @entity14			1
@entity20 , who has ruled @entity2 for more than 40 years , has gone to great lengths to strike a balance in relations with @entity8 -- @entity2 's neighbor across the @entity25 -- and his traditional allies in the west , especially the @entity28 and @entity7 according to a @entity7 diplomatic cable from december 2009 , the @entity2 foreign minister , @entity29 , offered to set up discreet talks between the @entity7 and @entity8			1
" when thanked by the ambassador for @entity2 's ongoing advice to @entity8 to work with the @entity36 , @entity33 offered @entity2 as both an organizer and a venue for any meeting the @entity7 would want with @entity8 - if kept quiet , " the cable said			1
anything to avoid " heated atmospherics , " in the words of another @entity2 official			1
the same cable showed that the @entity2 are more relaxed than others in the @entity46 about @entity8 's nuclear ambitions , with @entity29 telling the @entity7 ambassador that " even if @entity8 developed nuclear weapons , this action would not destabilize the region , a point vigorously countered by the ambassador			1
" the open door to @entity55 is part dictated by geographical necessity but also helps @entity2 follow a foreign policy independent of its giant neighbor , @entity60 , the most powerful member of the @entity61			0
@entity62 has a similar approach , much to the annoyance of the @entity60			0
@entity65 of the @entity66 and @entity67 says that " from the @entity2 point of view , they see the other @entity61 states as being ' over there ' behind the mountains ; we 're in front of the mountains			0
that separates them from the rest of what the @entity61 states are thinking			0
that 's why they feel that they can have a special relationship with @entity8			0
" @entity2 is separated from other @entity85 by the long and largely impenetrable @entity87 mountain range			0
at its northern end , the range gives way to the @entity46 and the narrow @entity25 , where the territory of @entity2 and @entity8 is just 18 miles apart			1
more than 15 million barrels of oil ( 40 % of the world 's total output ) pass through the @entity25 every day , which makes it a security headache for both countries			0
they have a joint military commission dealing with security in the shipping lanes ( which are mostly in @entity2 waters ) and smuggling			0
@entity2 sources say smuggling gangs use fishing boats to traffic @entity109 and @entity110 migrants , as well as weapons and drugs across the @entity25 from @entity8 to @entity2			1
not that @entity20 feels any ideological affinity with the @entity115 regime across the water			0
a friend of the @entity118 's , he is said to have been deeply troubled by the 1979 revolution			0
the sultan , who has no designated successor , is by all accounts an erudite figure equally at home in traditional @entity127 and modern western society			1
one dispatch from 2008 prepared for a visiting @entity7 envoy said , " you will find the @entity20 an engaging interlocutor			2
he is an intellectual whose interests range from sustainable agriculture to classical music			0
" he is also a pragmatist who has personally steered @entity2 's foreign policy			0
as one @entity7 diplomatic cable from the @entity143 in @entity2 puts it , " a common saying in the region is that @entity2 is a friend to all and the enemy of none			2
" @entity20 visited @entity8 in 2009 ( for the first time since 1974 ) , signing a number of agreements while urging @entity147 to engage in dialogue with the @entity7 over @entity8 's nuclear program and other disputes			1
a @entity7 diplomatic cable from 2010 published by @entity158 described @entity2 's perspective this way : " although they do not find the threat imminent , @entity8 is @entity2 's number one strategic threat ; however , the @entity153 fundamentally believes the threat can be mitigated through careful management of the relationship			1
" one example of that management is the recent establishment of a joint @entity2 - @entity8 investment company			2
given its proximity , @entity8 should be a natural trading partner for @entity2 , but it ca n't offer the help @entity2 needs in developing its mineral wealth and diversifying its economy			2
for those goals , @entity20 looks west			0
@entity2 has a free trade agreement with the @entity7 , allowing @entity7 companies to establish businesses there			2
it also buys @entity7 military hardware , such as f - 16s			0
even so , @entity2 authorities are careful not to antagonize public opinion by too close an association with the @entity7			2
the @entity2 were quick to reject reports last year that they would host @entity7 @entity182 anti-missile batteries , with a senior official stressing that @entity2 " does not allow its territory to be used to carry out any military operations against any country in the region			1
" similarly , both in private and public , @entity2 has been highly critical of @entity7 policy toward @entity192 , repeatedly appealing for @entity193 to exert greater pressure on @entity192 in negotiations with the @entity196			2
one diplomat in the region likens @entity2 's role to that of the @entity200 or @entity201 elsewhere : avoid making enemies but avoid entangling alliances .			0

@entity205 has " cordial " relations with @entity7 , @entity8
@entity2 sources helped win the release of @entity14 last year
@entity2 want to avoid " heated atmospherics , " official says
@entity20 said to be at home in both traditional @entity127 , modern western society
