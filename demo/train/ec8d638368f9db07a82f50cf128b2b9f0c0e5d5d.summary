@entity0 -- president @entity2 once believed marriage was only between a man and a woman			1
he then backed civil unions for gay and lesbian couples , granting them many of the same rights and privileges as married heterosexuals			0
now he firmly supports a constitutional right that has put him at odds with many social conservatives			1
it is a personal and political evolution that in many ways reflects the country as a whole			1
shifting public opinion and old fights over judicial power are at the nexus of perhaps the most important social issue the high court has addressed in recent years : same - sex marriage			1
there about 120,000 legally married homosexual couples in the @entity29			0
many thousands more seek the same thing			0
but it may be 10 people who have the power to force immediate , real change on this legal , political , and social issue : the nine justices and @entity2 himself			1
how @entity29 political leaders and the @entity39 in coming months could set the template for years on a contentious topic that shows no sign of cooling			1
" the argument that the @entity2 administration has made is the @entity39 should look at these laws very carefully because gays and lesbians are a group that have been subject to discrimination in the past and will be subject to discrimination going forward , " said @entity44 , a legal analyst and editor of @entity46			1
@entity56 has a family : a same - sex couple 's remarkable journey " so the @entity39 would need to subject these laws to what we call a very stringent standard of review " balancing the government 's justification for enacting them , she added			1
two separate appeals to be argued tuesday and wednesday will once again put the high court at center stage , a contentious encore to its summer ruling upholding the health care reform law championed by @entity2			1
nine states and the @entity0 allow same - sex marriage , including @entity0 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , and @entity83			1
another nine have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws			2
the high court will consider two appeals			2
the first involves the federal @entity89			2
@entity89 is a 1996 law that defines marriage between one man and one woman			2
that means federal tax , @entity96 , pension , and bankruptcy benefits , family medical leave protections , and other provisions do not apply to gay and lesbian couples			2
@entity103 , an 84 - year - old @entity83 woman , is the key plaintiff			2
she was forced to pay more than $ 363,000 in extra estate taxes when her longtime spouse , @entity103 , died			0
the second case involves @entity110 's @entity109 , a 2008 referendum that abolished same - sex marriage after the state 's highest court ruled it legal			1
gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court battle the @entity39 is being asked to establish same - sex marriage as a constitutional right , but could also decide a more narrower question : whether a state can revoke that right through referendum once it has already been recognized			1
running for the @entity123 state senate in 1998 , @entity2 said he was " undecided " about whether to legalize same - sex marriage			1
fast - forward six years to when he ran for @entity126			2
he then declared a belief that marriage is between a man and a woman			2
the stance began an internal process over time that was by his admission , anything but smooth			0
" my feelings about this are constantly evolving			0
i struggle with this , " he said in 2010 , two years into his presidency			0
" at this point , what i 've said is that my baseline is a strong civil union that provides them the protections and the legal rights that married couples have , " @entity2 said at the time			2
eight such states have civil union or strong domestic partnership laws -- @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity123 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , and @entity157			2
but it is the @entity110 case that really has drawn the @entity2 administration into the fight			1
@entity2 signaled earlier this month he was prepared to assert a vigorous constitutional right to marriage , but confine it for now only to the @entity109 matter and perhaps to the seven other states with civil union laws like @entity110 's			1
the @entity168 argues civil union and domestic partnership laws may themselves be unconstitutional and that those states should go all the way and grant same - sex couples full marriage rights			1
it 's called the eight - state strategy			0
" the object of @entity110 's establishment of the legal relationship of domestic partnership is to grant committed same - sex couples rights equivalent to those accorded a married couple			1
but proposition 8 , by depriving same - sex couples of the right to marry , denies them the dignity , respect , and stature accorded similarly situated opposite - sex couples under state law , " the @entity168 said in its brief on the case			1
gay rights groups had privately urged @entity2 and his top aides to go beyond his previous personal rhetoric in support of the right , and come down " on the side of history " in this legal struggle			1
this was all set in motion in the heat of the president 's re-election campaign in what government sources described as a quickly arranged political strategy			2
married same - sex couple awaits epic appeal " at a certain point , i 've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same - sex couples should be able to get married , " @entity2 told @entity211			1
perhaps bowing to political caution in an election year , @entity2 explained he " hesitated on gay marriage " partly because he thought civil unions " would be sufficient			1
" " i was sensitive to the fact that for a lot of people , the word marriage was something that invokes very powerful traditions and religious beliefs , " he said			0
a new national survey indicates a small majority of @entity29 backs such marriages but there are generational and partisan divides as well as a gender gap			0
according to a @entity1 / @entity233 poll , 53 percent of the public think marriages between gay or lesbian couples should be legally recognized as valid , with 44 percent opposed			0
" there are big differences among younger and older @entity29 , with the youngest age group twice as likely than senior citizens to support same - sex marriage , " says @entity1 polling director @entity237			1
" women are also more likely to call for legal recognition of gay marriage than men			0
and only three in ten @entity29 who attend religious services every week support same - sex marriage while six in ten @entity29 who do n't attend church weekly feel that way			1
" former president @entity252 , who signed the marriage law into effect 17 years ago , said this month he now backs the right of homosexuals to marry			2
so , too , does his wife , former secretary of state @entity259 , a possible @entity258 presidential candidate in 2016			0
but others on the right say society benefits from preserving a view of marriage that has been in place for centuries			0
the authors of a new book , " what is marriage ? man and woman : a defense , " say , " redefining marriage would , by further eroding its central norms , weaken an institution that has already been battered by widespread divorce , out - of - wedlock child bearing and the like			2
" academics @entity281 , @entity282 , and @entity283 say marriage should be more than " commitment based on emotional companionship , " and has been practiced for a specific reason throughout this country 's history			0
" all human beings are equal in dignity and should be equal before the law			0
but equality only forbids arbitrary distinctions , " they argue			0
" and there is nothing arbitrary about maximizing the chances that children will know the love of their biological parents in a committed and exclusive bond			0
a strong marriage culture serves children , families and society by encouraging the ideal of giving kids both a mom and a dad			0
" line forms days ahead of @entity39 same - sex argument the @entity89 and @entity109 cases will test the delicate line over constitutional limits from both congressional , presidential , and judicial power			1
all nine justices will have an equal voice in both oral argument and an eventual ruling , but it may be one member of the court whose views may count most in the high - stakes quest for five votes			1
justice @entity327 authored the landmark 1996 @entity329 ruling , striking down a @entity332 constitutional amendment that forbid local communities from passing laws banning discrimination against gays			0
the moderate - conservative wrote for the 6 - 3 majority , rejecting the state 's argument the law only blocked gay people from receiving preferential treatment or " special rights			0
" in dissent justice @entity345 criticized the court for placing what he said was " the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias			0
" in 2003 , @entity327 authored the court 's decision overturning state laws criminalizing homosexual sodomy			0
at the time though , he cautioned the court was not endorsing the idea of same - sex marriage , saying the private conduct case at hand " does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter			1
" that caution was further articulated this month by @entity327 , when he said some issues are best left to the other branches			0
" i think it 's a serious problem			0
a democracy should not be dependent for its major decisions on what nine unelected people from a narrow legal background have to say , " @entity327 said			0
by patiently letting legislatures and the voters decide the social and practical implications of same - sex marriage over the past decade , the high court is now poised to perhaps offer the final word on tricky constitutional questions			1
the split 5 - 4 conservative - liberal bench has the option of ruling broadly or narrowly -- perhaps taking a series of incremental cases over a period years , building political momentum and public confidence in the process			2
the @entity109 case is @entity394 ( 12 - 144 )			0
the @entity89 case is @entity29 v. @entity103 ( 12 - 307 )			0
opinion : slowly , @entity397 shifting on same - sex marriage			1

@entity2 now supports right to same - sex marriage , putting him at odds with conservatives
it has been a personal and political evolution for the president on a major social issue
@entity39 will hear arguments in two appeals on tuesday and wednesday
political stakes are high in appeals of federal and @entity110 same - sex laws
