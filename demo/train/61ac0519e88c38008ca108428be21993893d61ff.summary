she 's a charming cetacean who one minute will allow you to put your arm around her -- and the next leave you nursing injuries			0
as swimmers off the west coast of @entity8 are finding out , you do n't mess with @entity10 the dolphin			1
now authorities have been forced to erect signs around @entity14 , @entity15 , after a woman was hospitalized last sunday by the feisty bottlenose dolphin -- the fourth such incident since may			1
@entity10 has a checkered history in the area			0
first spotted in the waters off the coast of @entity15 in 2000 , reports began to surface as far back as 2004 that she was a little temperamental			2
according to media reports , one diver even claimed that @entity10 had tried to drown her			2
officials say that a record has never been kept of precisely how many incidents @entity10 has been involved in -- but they believe that the number has escalated this year			2
village suggest this could be because @entity10 moved to @entity32 -- which is much more heavily populated with swimmers than her previous hunting ground -- back in 2011			1
in the latest incident , the @entity36 and @entity37 reports that @entity10 rammed a woman in the abdomen resulting in her hospitalization			1
it 's only the latest in a series of incidents , the group says , with one woman having to be flown back to @entity47 via air ambulance as a result of her injuries			0
the @entity51 also warns that pursuing @entity10 could also result in an injury or even a fatality			0
and do n't even think about trying to take her picture			0
as one sign states : " if she does grab a camera etc , let her have it , or she might ram you or hit you with her tail			0
" @entity62 has now commissioned the @entity51 to produce advisory posters warning people not to approach @entity10			2
it has also asked lifeguards to put out red warning flags whenever @entity10 is spotted in the area			0
but beyond that there 's little else the authorities can do : the bottlenose dolphin -- which can grow up to 10 - feet long -- is an endangered species and is protected under law			1
