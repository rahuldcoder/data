-- i approached @entity2 on a hot , dry day out of @entity3 , down a broken road where children played , oblivious to passing cars			1
i pulled up by a small hut on the outskirts of the city , where i 'd been told to ask for @entity10			2
there he was , a slim , cheery , weather - beaten man who offered me coffee			2
i was sweating from the heat , but @entity10 found @entity16 cold at this time of year and he was wearing a blazer over two pullovers			1
i sat down to hear how this former sergeant in the @entity16 army had found himself guardian of one of the most extraordinary sights in the region			1
treasure beneath rubbish twelve years ago , @entity10 had retired from the military and returned to the @entity28 -- a broad , green swathe running for 120 kilometers through eastern @entity16 -- and his home in @entity2			1
" many @entity32 refugees had moved here in the time i 'd been away , " he said , " and i saw they 'd been throwing their rubbish into an old quarry			2
" at a loose end , @entity10 started removing the garbage from the site near his home			2
as he did , he uncovered an ancient object -- the largest single stone ever carved , lying at the bottom of the quarry			1
it was a huge piece of limestone , longer than a school bus and estimated to weigh more than a thousand tons			0
carved by the @entity50 more than 2,000 years ago , the monolith had been intended for the nearby temple complex of @entity52			1
now a @entity16 flag flies at one end of it , and , over the cafe @entity10 has set up nearby , a sign trumpets : " @entity58			1
" three gods traveling in the @entity61 , i 'd heard of @entity2 but not of @entity52			1
as we stepped down into the old shallow quarry , @entity10 pointed to the huge white columns of an abandoned temple visible on the horizon between two concrete housing blocks and loops of telephone wire			0
" in those days @entity2 was known as @entity52 , " @entity10 said			1
" our temple was the biggest ever built by the @entity50			2
" here they worshiped not one god but three : @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
today @entity52 is a @entity76			0
" @entity10 receives no government assistance for his upkeep of the quarry and the monolith so , as i was leaving , i bought a guidebook from his shop for $ 7			2
would he ever leave @entity2 , i asked as we shook hands			1
" i ca n't , " he said			0
" the quarry would go back to the way it was			0
i wo n't let that happen			0
" @entity90 : time for travelers to return ? " @entity52 " i drove on through the scruffy outskirts of modern @entity2 , parked my car and bought a ticket for ancient @entity2			1
a group of young @entity97 men marched into the ruins ahead of me			0
they were n't the first : @entity97 students have been coming to @entity2 for more than a century			1
before @entity101 , the @entity102 , an ally of the @entity104 who then ruled here , sent his best archeologists to excavate and secure the ruins			0
a drawing of their proposed reconstruction pinned to the ticket booth reads : " @entity52 , @entity2			1
" at the combined size of several football pitches , the three temples of @entity52 were built on a scale much larger than anything seen in @entity118			1
shrine to @entity120 the complex was actually constructed on top of a shrine to the @entity125 god @entity120			0
to build it , the @entity50 had first to create a vast plateau above the valley			0
that alone must have been an extraordinary undertaking			0
during the @entity133 era , the temple complex was quarried for buildings including the @entity135 in @entity136 ( the new @entity138 capital ) and the rest was roofed over to create a church of dimensions not seen again until the building of @entity143 in @entity118			0
when @entity144 came to the @entity28 , the steps of this church were hacked away to create an inaccessible @entity148 fortress held in 1175 by the mighty @entity149			0
crusaders besieged it several times but never broke through			0
today the complex still towers over this low - rise city			0
the occasional tourist wanders through in the company of a guide -- like @entity10 , always well wrapped up against the sunshine -- but you can have it to yourself most of the time			2
six top beers from the @entity61 vanishing tourists with civil war raging in its eastern neighbor , @entity167 , and security always fierce in @entity169 to the south , tourism has dropped off drastically in @entity16 in recent years			1
nature has also played a destructive part			0
inching away from @entity175 , the @entity174 tectonic plate has caused three earthquakes at @entity2 , bringing columns and pediments crashing down			1
yet still it somehow stands , huge and white , an ancient marble enclave within modern @entity2			1
the temple wins the crown for most impressive archeological site in the region , but there 's much more to see			2
at @entity187 there 's a mysterious pyramidal tower thought to have been built 3,000 years ago -- no one knows why			1
@entity16 white @entity16 may be dry but it is n't , so to speak , necessarily dry			1
@entity193 ¢ teau @entity192 ( +961 88 134 95 ) , founded in 1857 by @entity195 priests , created one of the first white wines in @entity16			1
" until recently we received 7,000 visitors a year , " @entity198 , who works in the visitor shop , told me			0
" this valley still produces more than six million bottles of wine a year , " she continued			0
" we sweep the car park every day			0
" everything might be slightly falling apart in the @entity28 , but then this strife - torn region often has to rely on the goodwill of people such as @entity10 to maintain its world class tourist attractions			0
nevertheless , the valley exudes calm			0
it 's seen a lot of history and knows it 'll see more			2
now , when the most recent chapter of that history has scared most people off , could be a good time to go			0
@entity2 is approximately 85 kilometers east of @entity3			2
@entity16 - @entity223 is one local company offering tours of the city and its sights ; +961 76 513 800			1
the monolith and @entity10 's cafe are located near the eastern entrance to @entity2 -- look for signs			1
no set opening times or entrance fee to the site			0
to visit ancient @entity2 , look for signs within @entity2 pointing to " @entity236 " ; open 8:30 a.m. until 30 minutes before sunset ; children under eight free , adults $ 8 ; guides are hired from around the ticket office , at the southeastern end of the temple complex , and cost around $ 14 an hour			2
more information on visiting @entity2 can be found on the @entity246 official website .			1

@entity252 of @entity2 was size of several football fields
travelers have many sights entirely to themselves
