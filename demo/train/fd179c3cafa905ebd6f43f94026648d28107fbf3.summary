-- some 220 miles above the @entity3 's surface , the shuttle @entity1 docked saturday afternoon with the @entity4 for the last time			1
due to problems lining up with each other , the shuttle 's " hard - mating " with the permanent orbiter threatened to push the six - man crew off schedule			1
the hook - up was finished around 3 p.m. , yet @entity13 's @entity12 noted a possibility that the installation of an express logistics carrier would not be completed until sunday , one day later than planned			1
instead , the crew took a little longer to tackle the job -- getting permission from the space agency 's mission control to sleep in an extra 30 minutes in return for the long day 's work , according to @entity13 's @entity25 feed			1
having been removed from the shuttle 's cargo bay and attached to the station 's truss , or backbone , the 8,235 - pound logistics carrier will be used to stow spare parts , including an extra radiator that was brought up by @entity1 's crew			1
overall , there were no major problems on the third day of the shuttle 's 11 - day mission , during which the crew is set to deliver a storage module , a science rig and spare parts to the space station and its six occupants			1
hatches to and from the shuttle and space station opened at 4:16 p.m. saturday , followed by a brief welcome ceremony and safety briefing			1
@entity1 started its 39th and final flight with a launch late thursday afternoon from @entity51 in @entity52			2
originally scheduled for november , the shuttle 's launch had been delayed to make repairs to the external tank 's support beams			0
and @entity13 halted its countdown on thursday , at five minutes , because of a computer problem related to safety on the " eastern range			2
" but after a confirmation that all was good to go , the countdown resumed , and the shuttle lifted off about three minutes behind its planned 4:50 p.m. et launch			0
at least four pieces of foam were seen flying off @entity1 about four minutes into the launch			2
@entity13 officials said they did n't foresee a problem -- explaining that , at that altitude , the flying foam was unlikely to do any damage to the spacecraft			2
that said , on saturday two astronauts shot numerous pictures of the shuttle 's thermal protection system , which will be sent down for analysis to make sure there is no significant damage			2
astronauts on sunday will continue moving items brought up on @entity1 over to the space station			1
final preparations will also be made for a spacewalk monday , when astronauts @entity88 and @entity90 will install a power extension cable , move a failed ammonia pump and perform other operations outside the shuttle			1
on day six of the mission , astronauts will work to attach a permanent module -- known as @entity98 -- to the station			2
the module will be home for experiments in fluid physics , materials science , biology , biotechnology and other subjects			0
the @entity1 crew is headed by @entity108			0
@entity90 , a late addition , became the first ever astronaut to fly consecutive missions after he was assigned to take the place of @entity113 when @entity113 was injured last month in a bicycle accident , according to @entity13			0
prior to thursday 's launch , @entity1 had spent 352 days in orbit , circling the @entity3 5,628 times			1
it has also carried 246 crew members , more than any space vehicle in history			0
" in a way , it 's ... sad to see the last flight , " astronaut @entity120 said thursday			0
" it 's such a wonderful vehicle			0
" the last scheduled launch of @entity124 is set for april 19			0
it will be commanded by @entity125 , the husband of @entity127 representative @entity126 , who is recovering from being shot last month in @entity128 , @entity129			0
the last ever shuttle mission will be @entity131 , tentatively scheduled to launch during the summer			0
@entity1 was the first space shuttle to dock with a space station of any kind when it met up on june 4 , 1998 , with @entity135 's now defunct @entity134			1
the craft also was the first to hook up with the @entity4 , doing so on may 29 , 1999 , according to @entity13			1
saturday 's event marked the 13th such docking for the @entity1 .			0

new : astronauts take extra time to install logistics carrier , then get ok to sleep in
the space shuttle docks 220 miles above @entity3 with the @entity4
there was a slight delay in " hard - mating " due to *alignment* issues , @entity13 says
@entity1 was the first space shuttle to dock with the space station in 1999
