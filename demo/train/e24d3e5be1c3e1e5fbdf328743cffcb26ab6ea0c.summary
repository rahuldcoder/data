-- the @entity1 accidentally e-mailed a draft version of president @entity4 's thursday schedule on wednesday night that included the back - and - forth between @entity1 staffers			1
members of the media got a behind - the - scenes look at what goes into president @entity4 's schedule			1
the e-mail , sent on a daily basis to inform the media of the next day 's events , at first appeared to be like any other press schedule			1
but at the bottom of the e-mail , there was a series of exchanges from the press team , as well as a draft of the schedule			2
the first section of the schedule noted that in the morning , @entity4 planned to talk with homeowners who have refinanced their homes and benefited from lower mortgage payments			2
one staffer , recommending changes to that line , wrote to " put more emphasis on the real people aspect of this			1
" the draft version said @entity4 will talk " with his economic team , " and also attending the meeting " will be a handful of households			2
" the final version took the emphasis off the economic team and said " attending the meeting will be a handful of homeowners ... as well as members of president @entity4 's economic team			1
" the draft schedule also showed the president hosting @entity47 to celebrate @entity48			0
the dinner was marked " closed press , " meaning no reporters allowed			0
one staffer asked , " can we remove the dinner at the end of the day ? " " we put it on yesterday 's deal -- so folks already know that it 's happening			2
they 'll wonder why it 's not listed if we do n't include it on there , " another staffer replied			0
the staffer who asked to remove the dinner from the schedule replied , " apparently @entity67 here and in neighboring states are now calling wondering why they have not been invited			0
" the dinner was not listed on the final schedule			0
in another exchange , one staffer recommended nixing a line about @entity4 meeting with leaders from the @entity77 since the president was now meeting with them before his remarks in an event closed to the media			1
" can we keep it and just change it to say before			0
its good for us to say we are meeting with them , " another replied			0
the final copy kept the line , noting that the @entity91 and @entity92 leaders would meet with @entity4 before his remarks			0
the @entity1 says the error was made by a sleep - deprived staffer , adding that the staffer will not suffer repercussions for the mistake .			1
