@entity0 -- the families of three @entity3 soldiers killed in @entity6 can sue the @entity7 for negligence over their deaths , the @entity3 's highest court ruled wednesday			1
the @entity11 ruling represents a defeat for the @entity7 , which had filed a challenge to an earlier @entity15 judgment			1
the legal firm representing some of the claimants , @entity18 , said the ruling would force the ministry to recognize " that it owes a duty of care to provide adequate equipment to service personnel engaged in military operations			2
" the claimants it represents include the widow of cpl. @entity26 , who was killed when the @entity28 tank he was in came under fire from another @entity31 tank on the fourth day of the @entity6 war in 2003			1
@entity18 also represents cpl. @entity33 and trooper @entity34 , who suffered severe injuries in the incident			0
they are known as the " challenger claimants " for the tank in which they were traveling			0
a separate group of claimants are the relatives of pvt. @entity44 and pvt. @entity45 , who were killed in separate incidents in 2005 and 2006 when lightly armored @entity47 hit roadside bombs			2
the vehicles were not fully equipped to detect roadside bombs or protect soldiers from a blast , the court heard			0
the claimants ' negligence claim is based on the argument that the soldiers were not properly trained or equipped by the @entity7 for their deployment in @entity6			1
in the case of the @entity60 , the claimants argue that the ministry failed to equip the @entity31 tanks with technology that would have confirmed their identity as friend or foe , and failed to provide the soldiers with " adequate recognition training " before they were deployed or in the combat theater			1
in the claim involving the @entity47 , the claimants say the ministry breached @entity73 human rights law because it failed to take measures that it " might have been expected to take in the light of the real and immediate risk to life of soldiers who were required to patrol in @entity47 , " according to the court ruling			1
the @entity7 argued that no duty of care was owed to the claimants by virtue of " combat immunity , " because their deaths and injuries were suffered on the battlefield			1
but the @entity11 dismissed that argument , on the grounds that decisions about the provision of equipment and training are made far from the battlefield			2
@entity95 , delivering the majority judgment , said : " @entity97 claims are about alleged failures in training , including pre-deployment and in - theater training , and the provision of technology and equipment			0
they are directed to things that the claimants say should have been done long before the soldiers crossed the start line at the commencement of hostilities			2
" lawyer @entity112 , of @entity18 , said they were " extremely pleased " with the decision			0
" the highest court in the land has now ruled the @entity7 , as employer , must accept that it owes a duty of care to properly equip service personnel who go to war , " she said			2
the ministry 's position is " morally and legally indefensible , " she said , adding that some soldiers had felt compelled to buy their own gps devices and other tracking equipment to try to ensure their safety and that of fellow servicemen			0
@entity3 defence secretary @entity129 said he was concerned about the wider implications of the judgment , " which could ultimately make it more difficult for our troops to carry out operations and potentially throws open a wide range of military decisions to the uncertainty of litigation			1
" but , he said , his thoughts remained with those who were injured and the families of those who died			0
" the most important priority is the protection of our troops , and since this litigation started , a wide range of protected vehicles , including @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity150 , @entity153 and @entity154 , have been available to commanders to match the most appropriate available vehicle to specific tasks , " he added			0
according to the @entity7 , the court acknowledged that the uncertainties of war have to be recognized and that the work of the armed forces should not be impeded by the threat of legal action			0
one of the judges , in a dissenting judgment , warned that the ruling would make extensive litigation against the @entity3 armed forces almost inevitable			1
interactive : @entity6 and @entity172 war casualties			0

the @entity3 @entity7 loses a @entity11 challenge
the ruling means the families of three soldiers killed in @entity6 can sue for negligence
the claimants say the @entity7 failed to adequately equip and train soldiers
defense secretary says he is concerned the judgment could lead to more litigation
