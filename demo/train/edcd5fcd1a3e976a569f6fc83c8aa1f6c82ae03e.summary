the shock felt in @entity10 , just outside of @entity11 , is as much over the sudden and senseless loss of @entity13 as it is over the circumstances of his death : the person accused of stabbing him was a 12 - year - old he had just met at the playground			1

@entity30 , meanwhile , " left the playground then went to a nearby residence where he asked to use the phone , " kentwood chief of police @entity58 said			2

" he called 911 , " he said			1
@entity69 described @entity30 as " calm and collected " throughout , and that he told the 911 dispatcher , " hi , i just stabbed someone , please pick me up and come kill me , i want to end my life			2
" the boy then calmly handed back the phone with the operator still on the line , according to @entity69 , and they waited for police to arrive			1
" at no point did i feel threatened , " he said			0

a competency hearing will be held soon , according to police , but @entity35 has already predicted an outcome : " my gut tells me they will go for an insanity plea , " he said			2
