-- recent events have left @entity3 watchers near breathless : government loss of control of border crossings into @entity7 and @entity8 , rebels temporarily holding portions of @entity11 , the unexplained movement of some of @entity3 's extensive arsenal of chemical weapons , and fighting spreading to the streets of the traditional @entity19 stronghold of @entity20			1
most dramatic though was the bombing of a @entity29 meeting in the heart of @entity3 's defense establishment , the @entity22 equivalent of a bomb going off in the @entity25 situation room			1
among those killed was @entity33			1
@entity33 was @entity3 's chief of military intelligence during my time at @entity36			1
the agency spent a great deal of time trying to work with him to get the @entity3 to stanch the flow of foreign fighters through @entity11 airport and onward into @entity7			1
the @entity3 never offered more than token cooperation , a policy that many in @entity11 may now regret as the routes they sponsored have been reversed with fighters now entering @entity3 from @entity7			1
our assessment at the time that @entity33 was tough , professional and loyal has stood up			1
married to president @entity52 's sister , he seems to have been providing a significant fraction of the regime 's spine over the past year			1
no one who has met @entity52 has come away impressed with the man 's leadership or decisiveness			1
if fate had been more kind , his elder brother @entity60 would not have crashed his car and died in an automobile accident and @entity52 could have lived out his days in an environment for which he was much better suited : doing eye surgery in @entity67 , building a happy family with his thoroughly anglicized @entity70 wife			1
personally ill - equipped to enact any of the " reforms " he sometimes called for , unable or unwilling to bend the @entity72 , @entity73 and other @entity19 clans to a new direction , @entity52 is now doubling down on his father 's violent response to opposition with none of @entity81 's skill or political sense			1
opinion : @entity3 's chemical weapons threat demands response i hesitate to call last week 's events a tipping point , but @entity90 's death ( along with the other senior fatalities ) will shake the @entity19 to their core			1
although some are irreversibly all in , there will certainly be others ready to cut their losses			0
and so , many observers are now focusing on endgame scenarios , particularly what a successor regime might look like			1
that question turns on what exactly is happening on the ground			0
the intelligence community has been continually asked to characterize the opposition -- its strengths , weaknesses , foreign influences			2
leadership , trustworthy personalities , untrustworthy components , political demands and overall intentions			2
but beyond these discreet facts , the intelligence community will also have to provide a narrative and identify compelling plot lines to help inform and shape policy			0
there are actually several plots lines affecting @entity3 today , all of them true and all of them relevant			1
in a curious way , at a macro-geopolitical level , we are seeing a resurgence of a broad @entity128 competition , with the @entity129 -- stung by what they view as the @entity134 's " bait and switch " @entity136 resolution authorizing action in @entity138 -- joining the @entity139 in blocking meaningful action through the @entity136			2
similarly , the broad @entity142 competition in the region has @entity144 trying to protect its lone @entity146 ally by putting its thumb on the @entity3 scale with arms and advisors while @entity152 , @entity153 and other @entity70 states arm and train the opposition			1
the most visible narrative is the one recorded on cell phone videos and broadcast daily showing a vicious , autocratic state using superior weaponry to gun down a determined and popular opposition			0
this is the plot line that has galvanized world opinion , igniting calls for intervention from a variety of sources			0
as true as this narrative is , it is also incomplete			0
@entity3 is a multi-ethnic and religiously plural society			2
the @entity19 and other @entity142 remnants comprise about 13 % of the population ; for 40 years they have controlled the state and have not hesitated to brutalize the more than 60 % of the population who are @entity146 sunnis and who are now in the streets attempting to overthrow their persecutors			0
the rest of the population -- ethnic @entity185 ( 10 % ) , @entity182 ( 3 % ) and @entity183 ( 10 % ) -- remain largely on the sidelines , for now at least as fearful of a @entity70 successor government as they are of continued @entity19 control			0
thus we should not allow the dramatic power of the most visible narrative , the struggle between oppressed and oppressor , to drown out the sad reality of another less noble story line -- namely that this is still , at least for now , a sectarian conflict			0
that this is the dominant narrative , the one that is most controlling and the one we should pay most attention to , is suggested by @entity201 's 2006 post mortem on @entity7			0
@entity201 observed that we mistakenly " thought of politics as the relationship between individuals and the state " rather than recognizing " that people in the @entity208 see politics also as the balance of power among communities			0
" we would do well to keep that in mind as the @entity3 end game approaches			2
we should accelerate work to get the minorities into the game against the regime , hastening its end and broadening its opposition			2
the @entity221 and @entity185 communities have historic ties to the @entity134 that should play to our advantage in this			0
we should also meter our support to the opposition based on its inclusiveness			0
@entity3 before the @entity72 lived in relative religious and ethnic harmony under largely @entity70 rule			2
it could be so again , but @entity231 and @entity232 offer examples where historic harmonies have fractured			0
the fall of the @entity236 is now as inevitable as it is welcome			0
but if this means a successor regime that is exclusively @entity70 , trending fundamentalist and opposed by a third of the @entity3 population , it could actually make things worse			1
and that would be a sad outcome indeed			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity249 : the endgame is approaching for the @entity3 regime
he says bombing of a security meeting killed @entity33 , a key *member* of regime
@entity52 lacks his father 's skill or political sense , @entity249 says
he says @entity264 should back opposition elements but regime could be *replaced* by civil war
