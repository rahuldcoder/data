editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of economics at @entity4			1
this op - ed is based on his book with @entity7 , " @entity8 : how @entity9 drives the economy , and why it matters for @entity11			2
" @entity7 is a 2001 @entity12 laureate in economics and professor of economics at the @entity16			2
@entity2 says basic psychogical factors led to excesses which have devastated the economy			1
( @entity20 ) -- president @entity23 's @entity22 head @entity21 noted in his speech march 13 that the economic crisis has led to an " excess of fear " that must be reversed			1
to understand the role fear plays in the current crisis , we must understand the role of human psychology			1
@entity33 thought psychology was the major cause of economic booms as well as busts , though this aspect of his work is now largely forgotten			1
he said people 's economic decisions , in both good times and bad times , are largely , ultimately , if indirectly , driven by animal spirits , primitive psychological tendencies			1
in a recently published book , @entity7 and i identified three animal spirits that played critical roles in the current economic meltdown			1
they are confidence , bad faith and storytelling			1
let 's first consider confidence and its dictionary meaning			1
confidence means complete and secure trust			1
but trust goes beyond the rational use of information that is usually considered in economic theory			1
@entity63 is largely an emotion			2
indeed we saw the role of vivid emotions in the stock and housing market booms that brought on our current problems			1
@entity63 is a state of mind that is the opposite of vigilance			2
people were purchasing and selling complex financial instruments without looking carefully at them			2
the second animal spirit that came into play was bad faith			2
with so many trusting people , an uglier side of human nature became prominent			2
the temptation for smart promoters was overwhelming			2
questionable practices boomed , and regulators failed to step in , because of the view , taken from economists , that private markets would be self - policing			2
investors would only put their money at increased risk if they were duly compensated by higher expected returns			2
thus , there was little worry about laxity of regulation in securities and real estate markets			2
but , this self - policing view did not consider that these investors might be overconfident			2
there is a myth that capitalism produces what people really want , as long as firms can make a profit			0
but , instead , more generally , it produces what people think they want , as long as firms can make a profit			0
true , unregulated capitalism will produce good medicines that cure our ills			0
but unregulated capitalism will also produce snake oil that people think they want , but does not cure our ills			0
( to guard against the production of such things , the federal government established the @entity121 in 1906			1
) the problem of snake oil has special relevance for financial assets , which are only pieces of paper			0
most investors can surmise their value only from what others , such as accountants and rating agencies , tell them			0
these accounting and rating agencies also have their own incentives			0
and those incentives have not been fully aligned with the public 's interest			1
and so when people are overconfident , financial markets produce assets that take advantage of that overconfidence			0
if unprotected by effective regulation , people will be sold snake oil assets			1
just recently an industry arose , in @entity147 and beyond , to produce them			0
a third animal spirit bolstered the previous two			0
people act and think and live according to stories , especially human interest stories , not usually abstract calculation			0
that goes for their personal decisions			0
but there is also always a story , usually with some grain of truth and human interest , about the economy			0
these stories are often overly exuberant , on the one side , or overly pessimistic on the other			0
ten years ago we had the story of the dot - com millionaires			0
most recently we believed alchemists of financial engineering were packaging risky financial assets to make them safe			0
and markets took advantage of their beliefs to sell them what later proved to be snake oil assets			0
these three animal spirits then explain how factors in human psychology play a key role in why the economy fluctuates as much as it does			1
the confidence comes and goes			1
the stories come and go			0
the snake oil comes and goes			0
this explanation for economic fluctuations has implications for the role of government			1
the first role of government is , before the fact -- as with the @entity121 -- to protect the public from negative consequences of their animal spirits ( and to let them prevail and even to encourage the positive consequences )			1
if , as now , the snake oil has been swallowed , it is the role of the government to restore our health			1
the government must aim to achieve full employment of the population by added spending to boost the economy and policies to make credit widely available			1
it should fulfill the full - employment goals of the @entity211			1
that means that producers who produce good products at a profit should have buyers who want to buy them ; workers who have trained for productive jobs should be able to get them			0
it also means that producers who can produce such products can get the credit to finance their production ; and buyers who want to purchase these products can obtain the credit to purchase them			1
why are such targets useful and necessary ? history tells us			0
in the @entity232 , both @entity230 and @entity231 had many pragmatic schemes to put people back to work and keep credit markets from falling apart			1
but for lack of a correct theory of the economy , and targets corresponding to that theory , their measures fell far short			0
unemployment in the @entity245 only fell below 10 percent after the start of @entity247 , in 1941			0
such targets are necessary for political reasons as well			0
any effective plan to resolve our crisis will involve massive sticker shock			0
the two targets are necessary to justify and explain the tough and expensive measures that need to be taken			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : economic boom gave rise to schemes that relied on trust
he says basic psychological factors are key to restoring confidence
government has a role in preventing fraud from being sold to the public , he says
@entity272 : government must aim for full employment and widely available credit
