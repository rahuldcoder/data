-- a @entity2 committee voted along party lines to cite attorney general @entity4 in contempt of @entity6 over documents sought by the panel investigating the botched gun - running sting called @entity10			1
on wednesday , president @entity11 entered the dispute by asserting executive privilege over the documents sought by committee chairman @entity15 , @entity16			0
here are the issues around the dispute : q : what is a contempt citation ? a : @entity6 can vote to hold a congressional witness in contempt of @entity6 if it considers the witness to be obstructing its ability to carry out its constitutional powers			2
for a person to be held in contempt , @entity6 must vote on a contempt citation in committee			1
this is different from finding a person in contempt , which only happens after the committee votes on a citation and then passes along the vote to the full house			1
the process involves a series of legal maneuvers including the president 's ability to assert executive privilege , as he did in this case			0
executive privilege is rarely accepted by @entity6 , but the @entity45 maintains that infringing on executive privilege erodes the balance of powers			0
q : why was @entity4 cited for contempt ? a : the @entity50 cited @entity4 for contempt for failing to hand over all the documents relating to @entity10 , the botched @entity45 sting operation linked to the death of @entity56 @entity55 agent @entity55 and a number of @entity59 citizens from some of the 2,000 weapons that fell into the hands of @entity59 drug gangs			2
q : when is the last time an executive branch official faced a contempt citation ? a : although this is the first time an attorney general has faced a contempt citation , other executive branch officials have been held in contempt of @entity6			1
most recently , @entity74 white house counsel @entity72 and chief of staff @entity73 were held in contempt of @entity6 despite @entity74 asserting executive privilege in their case			1
during the vote in early 2008 , a large number of @entity79 walked out in protest of what they saw as a partisan vote			0
@entity72 and @entity73 were accused of failing to cooperate in a congressional investigation into the mass firings of @entity56 attorneys and allegations that the @entity2 was using the @entity45 for political aims			0
their citations marked the first time @entity2 officials had been found in contempt of @entity6			1
what do you think ? share your view on video q : what happens next ? a : the partisan 23 - 17 vote in favor of a contempt in committee sends the decision to the @entity104 for another vote			0
if that vote finds @entity4 in contempt , then , according to @entity110 associate dean @entity109 , it is unlikely that @entity4 will be prosecuted for criminal contempt			2
" it would look like terrible overreaching to go for criminal contempt , " @entity109 said , which carries a penalty of $ 1,000 and up to one year in prison			0
instead , @entity109 says it is more likely the @entity2 will pursue civil prosecution in federal court , as it did in the @entity72 and @entity73 cases			2
the @entity2 general counsel 's office prosecuted the pair to gain access to the information @entity6 sought			1
@entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
