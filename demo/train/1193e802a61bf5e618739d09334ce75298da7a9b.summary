the @entity0 waded cautiously back into the larger debate over abortion on wednesday			2
a number of justices raised concerns about a @entity7 state law preventing activists from crossing a 35 - foot buffer zone around reproductive health clinics			1
during an intense hour of oral arguments , @entity7 officials said the issue was more about public safety and pedestrian access on local sidewalks			1
anti-abortion supporters countered their free speech rights were being violated			1
what the high court decides in coming months could affect a broader range of free speech arenas -- over issues such as war , taxes , corporate bailouts and elections -- where the location of the message is often key			1
" there was a considerable history of disturbances and blocking the [ clinic ] entrance , " said justice @entity30 of the @entity7 case			1
" so the state is trying to say : we want to make sure that the entrance is not blocked , and the only way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to everyone			1
we ca n't screen people to know who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive			0
" but justice @entity46 said the law was not content - neutral , since clinic workers can talk to patients inside the marked boundary , but not the protesters			2
" this statute says that there is an exemption for employees of the facility if they are operating within the scope of their employment , " he told the state 's attorney			2
" and surely coming out and saying this is a safe facility [ to enter ] is within the scope of their employment			0
so how do you justify that ? forget about the conduct now , focus on the speech that 's allowed			2
one can speak and say it 's safe			0
the other can not speak and say it is not safe			0
" eleven such women 's health clinics across @entity7 are covered by the fixed buffer zones			1
the current state law strengthened earlier restrictions that had created a floating 6 - foot protective bubble around clinic patrons approaching the facility			1
abortion rights supporters said it was ineffective , since they claimed it led to blocked entrances and a gauntlet of protesters surrounding patients and staff			2
some past anti-abortion protests have turned violent in the @entity87			0
the state 's 2007 revised " selective exclusion law " makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic " employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment " to " enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk " within 35 feet of " a reproductive health care facility			1
" anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from effectively talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances			1
at the @entity107 , a clear yellow semicircle on the sidewalk surrounds the front entrance			0
one of the regular activists -- and lead plaintiff in the appeal -- is @entity112 , is a lifelong @entity113 who generally spends mornings two days a week peacefully spreading her anti-abortion message			2
with a large cross around her neck , the 77 - year - old grandmother often uses a baby stroller as a prop , along with a portable dvd player with images of a fetal ultrasound			0
on a recent day , she was seen standing at the edge of the buffer , handing out pamphlets and carrying a baby 's knit cap			0
yet on wednesday , @entity112 was inside the courtroom to witness the pointed debate from the bench			0
her lawyer , @entity132 , told the court : " a law that makes it illegal to even engage in consensual conversation , quiet conversation , on a public sidewalk , an act that makes that a criminal act for which mrs. @entity112 can go to prison , i think , is not permissible under the @entity143			1
" echoing the state 's position , justice @entity144 asked : " it 's a little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not disrupt peace and order , so we 're just going to say 25 feet around a funeral , or 25 feet around any facility , that that 's never permissible ? " justices @entity157 and @entity159 pointed out the high court 's 2011 near - unanimous opinion favoring the right of the @entity163 to loudly protest at the funerals of military service members killed in war , however hateful and disgusting their speech may be			1
the court said even there , reasonable access regulations were necessary			2
" i thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted where they could go , " said @entity159 , not too close to the funeral			2
" many states have enacted similar laws , and i thought that 's important			0
" some justices worried the @entity7 buffer was too large , and that other less restrictive means might be available and still ensure public safety			1
" i 'm a little bit hung up on why you need so much space , " @entity144 told state attorney @entity184			2
" you know , 35 feet is a ways			0
... that 's a lot of space			0
" " surely you could have a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or protesting within 35 feet			2
is n't that more narrowly tailored ? " said justice @entity194			0
" what these people want to do is to speak quietly and in a friendly manner , not in a hostile manner , because that would frustrate their purpose , with the people going into the clinic			0
" @entity194 called the buffer a " dead speech zone			2
" justice @entity205 was especially animated , sharply questioning the views of the state and of the federal government in support of the buffer zones			2
" do you want me to write an opinion and say there 's no free speech right to quietly converse on an issue of public importance ? " he asked at one point			1
" in speech cases , when you address one problem , " like public safety , " you have a duty to protect speech that 's lawful			1
" handicapping the outcome may be hard in this case because chief justice @entity225 -- generally an active questioner -- remained silent during the entire argument , and thus not revealing his views			0
justice @entity228 -- who generally sides with the conservative bloc -- also said nothing wednesday , as was his custom			0
after arguments @entity7 attorney general @entity232 said the state law would apply " in other areas like in voting or in protest areas where the interests in making sure that we have public safety , we have an orderly ability for people to go about their business has been balanced , just the way we did it in this statute			1
" but @entity112 told @entity247 her ability to counsel women who are walking inside the clinic was being impeded			0
" i only get so far -- and they are listening because they do n't really want to go in , " she said			0
" they need somebody to care for them and i care			0
but then when we get to the buffer zone i have to stop , and then they keep going and i lose			0
and one person lost -- one mother and one father that i can not help -- is one too many			0
" demonstrators have appeared regularly at clinics in @entity263 , @entity264 , and @entity265 and say they are unfairly singled out for exclusion on public property			1
the last time the high court took a close look at the issue was in 2000 , upholding @entity272 's broad " no approach zone " regulations			1
similar to the earlier @entity7 law , protesters were kept at least eight feet from anyone within 100 feet of any health care facility			1
municipalities in @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 and elsewhere have since enacted similar " fixed " and " floating " buffer zone laws for clinics			0
the justices last month heard arguments in a separate appeal involving a longtime anti-war protester kept from spreading his message along a public right - of - way at @entity290 in @entity281			1
the sidewalk outside the @entity87 @entity0 itself is the scene of daily anti-abortion protests sponsored by @entity294 , where mostly young @entity296 adults stand silent wearing red tape across their mouths with the handwritten word " life			0
" and next week 's 41st anniversary of the @entity303 high court ruling legalizing abortion will attract thousands of marchers on both sides of the issue outside the court , just across the street from the @entity310			1
the @entity7 case is @entity112 v. @entity232 ( 12 - 1168 ) .			1

justices hear oral arguments on @entity7 law restricting activists
state officials say issue more about public safety than free speech rights
court decision could have broad impact on other issues that attract demonstrators
