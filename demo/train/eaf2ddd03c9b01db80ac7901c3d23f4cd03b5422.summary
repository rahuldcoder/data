@entity0 -- justice @entity2 is a conservative in thought , but not in personality			1
a new biography of the colorful @entity8 jurist paints a complete picture of his enormous ongoing influence on the law and society			1
" @entity13 : the life and @entity21 of @entity8 justice @entity2 " ( @entity23 ) offers the first comprehensive look at the first @entity15 on the high court , and the rhetorical battles he has waged on the court and off			1
@entity1 spoke with @entity24 , the book 's author , who also is a reporter for @entity26			1
@entity24 has covered the high court for two decades , holds a law degree from @entity29 and has also written a biography of @entity8 @entity31			1
@entity1 : @entity2 has a certain public image in the minds of many @entity34			1
you 've known him for years and interviewed him several times for this book			1
is he the same in private ? @entity38 : he 's a lot more of himself in private			2
he actually is very confrontational behind the scenes , just as he is in public			2
but he also can be quite funny , quite casual , generous and decent			0
his best friend on the bench is justice [ @entity44 [ a low - key , liberal justice but , like @entity2 , a @entity47 who loves opera ]			1
he 's very consistent on the law , but he 's a lot of things in terms of his personality			1
@entity1 : he has told me that one of the happiest times in his career was in the executive branch , where he said that 's where the action was , instead of serving on the bench			2
@entity38 : remember what it was like working in the [ @entity68 's ] @entity67 in the @entity70 era [ in the @entity72 and @entity73 administrations ]			2
it was an exciting job for him , there was a lot of tension , and conflicts with the legislative branch			0
he really thrived on that			2
at a time when many @entity84 lawyers were trying to get out of the @entity72 administration , as @entity86 was moving to a climax , he was trying to move up and be promoted			0
he sparred with @entity89 lawmakers , and was trying to exert executive privilege claims , when that was a dirty word in the wake of @entity86			0
@entity1 : growing up , you describe " @entity98 " -- as his friends and family call him -- as something of a golden child			0
@entity38 : i 'd always known he was an only child , who , interestingly , later went on to have nine children , but i did n't know he was the only offspring of his generation from two immigrant @entity15 families			2
for his parents and his aunts and uncles , he was the center of their universe , but it put a burden on him to perform , to be this special child			0
i found the conflicts in terms of being a product of two different families continue to reveal himself			1
the father was quite cerebral , was a professor , always had his nose in a book , he did n't abide any kind of silliness			2
and his mother 's side was much more flamboyant			2
you had these contrasting families , and , as i write in the book , he learned to deal with conflict and tension early on in his life , and went on to readily generate it as an adult			1
@entity1 : many conservatives worship @entity2 , and yet you suggest his influence has not had as far - reaching an effect inside the high court as many believe it to be			1
how do his colleagues view him ? @entity38 : i talked to his colleagues about where he 's at			2
justice [ @entity143 says he is committed -- some of his impact made a huge difference , some of it unfortunate			2
@entity143 , the senior liberal , has dueled with @entity2 dozens of times , from @entity150 [ the 2000 presidential election dispute ] to recent dilemmas testing the @entity153 detainees			1
@entity154 , his closest friend on the court , sees his influence beyond the marble walls , and that 's the way i 've been mostly viewing him until the recent terms			1
he is influential with conservative acolytes			2
within the court , he certainly alienated [ now - retired justice @entity160 , @entity161 , and in some ways @entity163			1
it made his influence rather slight for years -- he really did n't want to deal , to negotiate with his colleagues in rulings			2
despite a charming personality in many ways , he told me he had nothing to trade			0
he was just plain firm about where he wanted to go , and he would n't settle for half a loaf			2
the addition of chief justice [ john ] roberts and justice [ @entity176 ] @entity175 on the bench allowed him to win more			0
and in recent terms , there has a been a culmination , a resurgence , on what he is able to do , now with the [ conservative ] bodies coming on the court to support him			1
but he told me he was still not satisfied			0
" the wins , " he told me , " damn few			0
" @entity1 : in his bright , bold opinions , what is he trying to accomplish ? does he reach for broader audience ? @entity38 : look at 1996 's @entity189 -- the gay rights case			0
he lost on that one , and his dissent was written for consumption way beyond the court			0
it was a complete battle cry			0
he lashes out at the court for placing what he said was " the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias			0
" this dissent became more of a story than the opinion itself			0
people were reading it and giving it airspace , and that 's what he wanted			1
that was his style of most of the ' 90s : get as much attention as possible , because he was in dissent so much in big cases			0
now , in the recent @entity226 case case [ where @entity2 wrote the main opinion striking down @entity0 's , strict handgun ban ] , he was not going able to write an opinion as boldly as he may have wanted , in terms of some of the zingers that he packs into his other opinions , because he has to keep his majority			1
but he still will not mince words if he is in dissent , because he knows journalists , law students , policy makers will all pay attention , and it will influence people down the road			1
@entity1 : and yet controversy seems to dog him , including the duck hunting trip he took with vice president [ @entity245 ] @entity244 at a time the high court was considering an appeal from @entity244 's office ; and a hand gesture @entity2 made outside a @entity250 some interpreted as obscene			1
@entity38 : i do n't think he cares			0
he 's got these intense feelings he 's not going to keep in check			0
@entity1 : what prompted this project , and what do you want readers to know about @entity2 ? @entity38 : i found most of what was written about him was either one side or the other -- screeds easily from the left and embraces easily from the right			1
and i thought there was so much to his background that was worth revealing in an objective way , to see what he was all about : how @entity2 became @entity2			1
he was really part of the conservative moment we saw in the 1980s			0
young lawyers at the time like @entity276 and @entity175 embraced his theories , and look where they ended up			0
@entity1 : in your interviews with him and his family , did you expect that level of cooperation ? @entity38 : no , i did n't			0
in the beginning , he said he would encourage colleagues to talk to me , but he did n't want to sit and talk on the record			0
but he soon became quite intrigued at my research into his family , immigration records and such			0
and i 'd be at my desk , and he 'd be calling me , asking me what i found out about his ancestors			0
so those later , extensive interviews made this book			0
@entity1 : there is a challenge about writing on the often cloistered world of the @entity8 , these personalities that remain below the radar for most people			0
@entity38 : i wanted a book that would demystify him , and make people understand him			1
i wanted readers to know : this is your court , you should know about these people and what they 're up to			1
but it is tough , it 's so hard to get information about the institution that does n't have to do with the precise words on the rulings			0
and it 's fun to dig up this background , and get in with these justices and talk with them one - on - one			1
i was so grateful to speak with justices @entity143 , @entity44 and even @entity321 , who all shared great stories and offered their insights into @entity2 .			1
