-- " i saw these seats before the tournament began but it 's not a good way to deal with it			2
it 's a kind of segregation , " explains dr. @entity5 , a bariatric ( weight - loss ) surgeon in @entity9 , @entity10			1
@entity5 is referring to the 4,750 extra-wide seats made available in the stadiums of this year 's @entity14 to accommodate @entity10 's burgeoning obesity problem			1
set aside at the ends of rows throughout the stadium , the low - backed , wide - set seats for obese people have been built in accordance with @entity10 law , in which obesity is classed as a disability and must be accommodated			1
after their national team 's humiliating exit from the @entity14 , @entity10 ' immediate concerns might be the country 's footballing future , rather than its health , but obesity has become mainstream in @entity10 society and is continuing to rise			1
in 2012 , around one in seven @entity10 were classed as obese			1
globally , @entity10 is far behind countries such as the @entity33 and @entity34 , where around a third of people are obese , but the concern is the rapid rate of weight gain			1
the country once vulnerable to malnutrition and the associated health impacts , such as impaired growth , is instead now vulnerable to obesity and resulting heart disease and diabetes			2
in 1975 just 19 % of @entity10 men and 29 % of @entity10 women were overweight : in 2014 those figures are now 54 % and 48 % respectively			1
" the transition to becoming overweight has been rapid in the whole of @entity55 over the past 20 years and countries have gone from having below 10 % of their population overweight to over 50 % , " explains @entity50 , professor of public health nutrition at the @entity52			2
" @entity10 is very diverse -- in the south it is like @entity61 but in the north you have regions of poverty and then in the @entity66 you have rural indigenous populations , " he explains			1
" but all over the country low - income populations have become dependent on food that is high in both carbohydrates and sugars			2
" this change in consumption has led to a rapid change in weight and therefore health			0
@entity78 operates on obese people who come to him with no other hope , in a country once known for its beautiful beach bodies			1
" when i first started as a bariatric surgeon i had maybe one patient a week , but now i have five to 10 per week " explains @entity5 , who has been treating obese patients for 10 years			2
" at first it was people wanting to be beautiful again , but now people are coming from across the country with a sense to be healthy			2
" bariatric surgery involves a range of surgical procedures with the overall aim of reducing a patient 's appetite and food consumption			0
it is , in @entity5 's eyes , a last resort for patients who have become " morbidly obese " and is not for those who are simply overweight			1
the key to helping them is a change in diet and consumption habits , which have changed extensively in recent years			0
@entity50 puts it down to changes in the food people now have access to			2
" healthy foods have become more expensive , " he says			0
communities across the country -- both urban and rural -- have reduced their intake of fruit and vegetables to include more meat , sugar and processed foods			0
globalization has enabled even the most rural of residents to access processed foods ; @entity122 , for example , has provided scheduled boats since 2010 that serve as floating supermarkets for communities residing along the @entity126			0
remote communities can now buy branded goods and often to choose those instead of local farm produce			0
" in @entity10 , being thin is associated with poverty , so culture has accepted being heavier as a desirable trait , " says @entity50			1
this dramatic change in food culture has made cardiovascular disease and stroke the leading cause of death in the country according to @entity50 -- followed closely by diabetes			1
public health teams are calling for a change in attitudes towards health			0
" the healthy choices need to become the easy choices , " explains @entity50			0
" the poor are growing as fast as the rich and everyone needs to understand more about what they are eating			0
" this is n't a problem unique to @entity10			1
however , the @entity10 government , and ministry of health , are taking the matter seriously and have been heralded for their recent projects issuing food guidelines for the public and creating programs for schools to source 40 % of their food locally as childhood obesity is approaching adult levels			1
@entity5 believes in the power of changing national eating habits			0
" surgery is a radical way to treat obesity and only for the patients i see , for which it is a necessity to live , " he says			0
but he believes it may be necessary to target key populations at first			0
" morbid obesity is concentrated inside the city so we need to make changes there			0

more than half of @entity10 are now overweight and 1 in 7 are obese
cardiovascular disease and stroke are leading causes of death in @entity10 , says expert
