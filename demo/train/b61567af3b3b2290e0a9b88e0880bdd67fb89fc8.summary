liberation 70 years ago today at @entity2 was anything but a celebration for my mother , @entity5 , who as an 11 - year - old prisoner was one of the very few children to survive the @entity10 death factory			1
she lacked the capacity to celebrate as @entity14 troops in their long coats and fur hats plowed through the snow - covered landscape into the massive camp			1
@entity5 was emotionally numb , intellectually bewildered and physically drained			2
at that moment she could hardly imagine that the madness that had destroyed her family and community could suddenly be lifted , that life could somehow return to a semblance of normality			2
@entity0 simply allowed her to ease her focus on immediate survival and begin a long search for understanding			2
in the days leading to liberation , she and her mother , @entity30 , had hidden under the wooden planks of a barrack as @entity10 guards evacuated the camp , forcing prisoners on death marches and shooting those who could not march ; she had witnessed musselmen , skeletal figures inhaling their last breaths , collapsing upon each other in a pile of death			1
she had repressed mourning for her little brother @entity45 who had been gassed four months earlier			2
one had to endure with stoicism , since any show of emotion could elicit a deadly beating or a bullet to the head			2
she had lived under a cloud of uncertainty and fear , wondering what had become of her father who had also been imprisoned in @entity2 , all as she suffered from tuberculosis and malnutrition			1
the @entity14 @entity59 may have have physically liberated @entity60 , but mentally she remained imprisoned , still feeling that she was surrounded by death			1
the coming days brought a series of disorienting events , rather than celebrations			0
the @entity14 handed the children striped prison uniforms , which they had never worn in camp			0
@entity5 put the uniform over her gray sackcloth dress , then marched with the other children by the barbed wire as a @entity14 camera crew filed the scene			0
this would become an iconic film clip documenting the liberation , but one that spread the false idea that all @entity2 prisoners wore such striped uniforms when in fact they were for slave laborers who worked in @entity84 brigades outside the camp			1
on the train ride with her mother and @entity88 back to their hometown of @entity90 in central @entity91 , people exclaimed , " oh , the @entity92 are back			1
too bad @entity93 did n't kill you all ! , " then shoved @entity30 and @entity88 off the train			0
the @entity96 was over , but hate remained very much alive			0
it was not until four decades later that the day of liberation would come to be a celebration of sorts			0
@entity5 , her cousin @entity102 and a small group of child survivors gathered on january 27 , 1985 , to celebrate what they determined was their common " birthday " -- the day they were reborn to have a second chance at life			0
for each year afterward , the child survivors would meet for a weekend around january 27 to celebrate their rebirth , share cake , flowers and good wishes , but also to reflect , discuss , study and help each other face the trauma they had endured			0
enough time had elapsed that they could then confront the nightmare			0
study and reflection is exactly what the @entity124 intended for this date when in 2005 the international body declared january 27 to be @entity128			1
the @entity124 urged " ... member states to develop educational programmes that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the @entity96 in order to help prevent future acts of genocide			1
" today , there are numerous deeply meaningful curricula that are of great benefit to students of all backgrounds			0
just as my mother and her child survivor friends sought understanding as they tried to come to terms with the unimaginable , students around the globe must be engaged in education about the @entity96 and the lessons it holds for humanity -- because , tragically , the liberation of @entity2 failed to deliver an end to terrorism and genocide			1
the world continues to suffer from too much hate - driven violence , from this month 's terror attacks in @entity159 , to genocides in @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , all case studies that the lessons of the @entity96 70 years on remain as relevant as ever			1
they still must be taught , more widely disseminated and never forgotten			0
this is a day not merely to commemorate , but to educate .			0

@entity170 's mother was 11 when she was among those liberated from @entity2
on @entity128 , the lessons of the terrible event have not been learned in many parts of the world , he says
