-- @entity1 was recently quoted in an @entity0 magazine article as saying that there have been only one and a half good movies ever made about frat life : " @entity7 " and the first half of " @entity9			1
" i 'd throw 1984 's " @entity13 " into the mix , but i get his point			2
too few comedies have been able to capture the gonzo , bacchanalian spirit of the @entity17 system with some degree of wit			0
well , now you can add @entity1 's raucously inspired " neighbors " to the honor roll			1
it 's a frat - house flick with more on its mind than beer , bongs , and beer bongs			1
it 's also a razor - sharp commentary on desperately trying to remain carefree after the burdens of adulthood have taken over			1
@entity32 : is ' neighbors ' the season 's best comedy ? directed by " @entity36 's " @entity37 , " neighbors " stars @entity1 and @entity39 as @entity40 and @entity41 , a 30 - something couple with a newborn daughter , a sensible station wagon , and a crushing mortgage on a house littered with breast pumps and baby monitors			1
what they do n't have is any of the spontaneity of their 20s			0
exhibit a : as the film opens , @entity1 and @entity56 are getting hot and heavy in the bedroom , only to realize that their baby is watching @entity61 tell @entity62 he 's about to take her to '' @entity63			1
'' plans to go out clubbing with their less exhausted single friends go just about as well			0
then one morning , moving trucks show up next door and unload a sea of whooping , @entity66 - clutching frat boys			2
led by the chiseled , vacant alpha dog @entity75 ( @entity76 ) and his @entity78 wingman @entity77 ( @entity79 ) , the guys of @entity73 proceed to turn @entity40 and @entity41 's quiet , tree - lined slice of suburban heaven into a hedonistic hell			1
at first , @entity40 and @entity41 see their new neighbors as an opportunity to prove that they 're more than just the sum of their @entity86 , that they 're still down to party and reclaim their laid - back youth			2
the couple obliviously try to cozy up with @entity75 and @entity77 , but every time they hope to show how cool they are , it becomes more and more clear that they 're just the annoying old buzzkills next door			0
and when the raging gets a bit too epic and the meatheads refuse to keep it down , it 's war			0
the two sides launch into a hilarious volley of tit - for - tat pranks that gradually escalates into a gross - out gag @entity104 with obscene topiaries and gargantuan dildos as the weapons of battle			0
@entity109 may play @entity110 in film based on ' @entity112 ' one of the best surprises in @entity114 and @entity116 's script is its refusal to succumb to lazy sitcom stereotypes , which would set @entity1 up as the oafish @entity121 man - child and @entity56 as the nag			1
instead , @entity41 is as foul - mouthed , shallow , and irresponsible as her husband			0
speaking in her native @entity126 twang , @entity56 shows that she 's a deadpan comic ace			0
and thanks to her chemistry with @entity1 , " neighbors " proves that just because you grow up does n't mean you have to be a grown - up			1
you can still be wild and crazy even as you 're yelling at the kids next door to get the hell off your lawn			0
