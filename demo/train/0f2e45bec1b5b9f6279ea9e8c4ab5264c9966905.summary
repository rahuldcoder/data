-- for the second time in three years , the @entity2 city of @entity3 has been declared the most expensive city in the world for expats by @entity7 , a human resources consulting firm			1
while it 's true that most of the @entity13 capital 's population lives in poverty on the outskirts of the city , in the center , @entity9 share the road with @entity19 and the latest @entity20			2
@entity21 makes such a killing here that it opened a second store within walking distance of the first			1
for those not familiar with @entity3 , however , the ranking may come as a surprise			1
@entity29 ( which took top spot in @entity7 's survey last year ) makes sense as the world 's most expensive expat city			1
so might @entity35 or @entity36			0
but @entity3 ? what 's it like to visit ? so , what 's this scandalously expensive place -- where a mid-level expat professional might earn $ 10,000 a month -- like to visit ? @entity42 , some context			1
@entity3 is the capital of @entity2 's second largest oil producer , @entity13 ( @entity45 beats it ) , a rising political and economic powerhouse			1
yet the country also suffered a destructive and violent 27 - year civil war , ending only in 2002 , which crippled its infrastructure and decimated its ability to produce its own food			0
as a consequence , almost everything in @entity3 has to be imported			1
heavy import duties , along with high taxes and monopolized supply chains linked to the powerful political elite further drive up the price of goods and services to astronomical levels			2
then there 's institutional corruption , which creates high prices through price fixing and price collusion			2
@entity68 - high hotel bills hotels are the visitor 's biggest expense			0
despite more opening in recent years , prices have remained stuck at about $ 500 a night for five - star hotels , $ 350 - 400 for four - stars and $ 300 - 350 for mid-level lodging			0
a meal at @entity3 's smartest restaurants will easily top $ 100 per person , including appetizers and drinks			1
such prices can be supported only by expats working for multinational companies and wealthy @entity13 who work for the country 's burgeoning oil and banking sectors			2
most @entity90 , by contrast , live on the city 's periphery and make vastly inferior incomes			2
while a mid-level banking professional might take home $ 8,000 - $ 10,000 a month , a driver or housemaid makes $ 500 a month , if the boss is feeling generous			0
luxury car traffic jams may be a common sight in the capital , but the roads are appalling and public services -- from driver 's license renewal to the post -- are horrendous			1
( perhaps send your postcards after leaving the country			0
) still keen to go ? @entity3 is a dynamic , albeit challenging , place to visit and one you 're unlikely to forget			1
but it does n't have to be prohibitively expensive -- if you know where to look			2
a ' cheap ' day and a night say you 're in @entity3 for a day and a night			1
you 'll need a hotel : @entity3 ( @entity114 , @entity115 ; +244 222 642 600 ; from $ 500 a night ) is considered the best in the city , with prices to match , while executive @entity119 ( @entity118 s / n , @entity119 , @entity3 ; +244 915407117 ; from $ 300 ) , offers rare decent value , all things considered			1
as soon as you step out of the hotel door , the only way to avoid a cash hemorrhage is to follow the age - old expat line and start living like a local			0
the city does n't have much in the way of museums and public parks , but it 's worth walking along the recently refurbished @entity131 , the seafood promenade that stretches from the local port to the @entity134 , the peninsula jutting into @entity135			2
if you do , keep an eye on the imposing , whitewashed @entity138 fort perched on a hill overlooking the city ; once you get close , take a left , go up the hill and you 'll find an armed forces museum ( +244 222 373 623 ) located inside the structure			0
beach life beaches are a must in @entity13 in summer			0
near @entity3 , @entity148 is a spit of land with thatch - roofed restaurants and hotel bungalows on one side and miles of deserted beach , with fantastic waves , on the other			1
you can catch water taxis out to @entity158 at the @entity160 dock ( $ 5 ) and spend the day there			0
another option is to get out of @entity3 altogether and head 40 kilometers south to the @entity162 , a beautiful landscape of cliffs , pinnacles and valleys stretching toward the horizon			1
dotted with baobab trees , the long , empty savanna will make you question why everyone stays crammed in the city			0
at @entity173 , about 150 kilometers south of @entity3 , you 'll find some of the country 's finest beaches , excellent for surfing			1
@entity13 cuisine @entity13 has a culinary tradition influenced by 500 years of @entity138 colonization and seafood from more than a thousand kilometers of coastline			0
in the @entity115 , @entity3 's central business district , a good spot for lunch is @entity184 ( @entity114 16 , @entity115 ; +244 923 542 868 ) , a friendly @entity13 bistro where the beer is cold and the food is cheap			1
it 's within walking distance of some of the city 's most popular hotels and the average check is $ 20			0
at @entity194 , where many of the city 's best restaurants are located , two low - key favorites are @entity198 do @entity199 ( @entity200 , @entity201 ) and @entity202 ( @entity200 , after @entity203 on your left side ; it has blue walls and white bars on the outside )			0
at both places you can eat a feast -- featuring excellent mufete , a local delicacy of beans stewed in palm oil , grilled tilapia , onion vinaigrette , boiled plantains , sweet potatoes and yucca -- for about $ 17			0
for dinner , on the fringes of central @entity3 in the @entity221 you can try the excellent cuisine of @entity13 master chef @entity224 at his @entity226 ( @entity225 , @entity227 , @entity3 ; +244 943 256 193 )			2
entrees here rarely top the $ 30 mark , and if they do it 's because you 're getting enough food for two			0
splurge time and if you want to splurge -- this is the world 's most expensive city , after all -- @entity236 ( @entity237 15 , @entity134 do @entity173 , @entity3 ; +244 936 000 018/9 ) is the king of @entity3 restaurants			1
entrees here can cost $ 150 -- seafood is flown in from @entity243 three times a week			0
you 're spoiled for choice if you want to prolong your night in @entity3			2
the city 's new nightlife darling is the @entity248 , in the bowels of the @entity250			0
but you could skip the $ 40 minimum spend there and experience true @entity3 nightlife at the @entity253 -- where there 's all kinds of music , a welcoming crowd and the $ 20 cover includes three drinks			1
@entity260 runs the @entity262 website .			0

@entity3 is the *priciest* city in world for expats , says survey for second time
luxury traffic jams and @entity21 stores common
corruption *endemic* and services appalling
possible to visit without breaking bank -- and have a *memorable* experience
