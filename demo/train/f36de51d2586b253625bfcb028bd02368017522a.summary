-- honeymooners and international hotel owners are at the center of an acrimonious showdown over religion between the government and opposition parties in the popular luxury tourist destination of the @entity9			1
the @entity10 last week banned the use of spas across the country , sparking a fiery debate over @entity16 's role in the governing of the island nation			1
the nation 's pristine beaches and rich marine wildlife drew nearly 800,000 tourists in 2010			2
the move has prompted confusion , legal action and civil disobedience in the @entity28 nation , which has a population of about 350,000			1
" the government has ordered all the spas in the islands to shut down , " said @entity30 , the manager of @entity31 and @entity32 in the @entity9			2
but the hotel industry " is not going for that , " he said			1
" we are open today and never closed , and the other hotels are keeping their spas open as far as i know			2
" the standoff over tourists ' rights to have massages and skin treatments at the high - end resorts , many of which charge thousands of dollars for a night 's accommodation , came following calls from opposition groups for a stricter imposition of @entity16 values in the @entity16 country			1
the opposition 's demands conflict with the more liberal stance of president @entity59 , who has urged the country to stick what he describes as the more " tolerant " strain of @entity16 that it has practiced for hundreds of years			1
the situation came to a head after opposition groups staged a demonstration on december 23 in which they advocated , among other things , for a crackdown on massage parlors in the capital , @entity72 , and other more densely populated areas			1
rather than ignore the demands , the government raised the stakes last week by issuing an order to close all massage parlors and spas across the country 's nearly 1,200 islands			1
the opposition groups had not sought such a blanket ban of spa activities , said @entity85 , a spokesman for @entity86 , which participated in the rally			2
" we respect tourists , " he said			0
" we are very happy with the tourism industry in the @entity9			2
" in a statement , the president 's office suggested that the broader ban was an effort to highlight contradictions in the positions of some opposition figures			0
" ironically , the same opposition leaders who railed against spas and the selling of alcohol and pork to tourists are some of the country 's biggest resort owners , " the statement said			1
opposition leaders involved in the tourism industry include @entity110 , the founder and chairman of @entity112 , which owns five resorts in the @entity9			0
@entity110 is also the head of @entity116 , which participated in the december 23 rally			0
repeated efforts on monday to reach @entity110 were not successful			0
the hotel industry reacted to the ban by seeking a temporary court injunction and by holding talks with the government to try to get the spa services at major hotels excluded from the order , said @entity127			1
" this was done for political purposes , " he said			0
" nobody has come out to check on us or to carry out inspections			0
" for its part , the government has suggested that it is willing to compromise with the big operators			0
" several have raised concerns over our decision , " @entity138 , the tourism minister , was quoted as saying over the weekend by the local news service @entity140			0
" we are considering allowing resorts to operate spas			0
" @entity0 's @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
