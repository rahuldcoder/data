in a world where computers are increasingly powerful and are concealed within ever more glossy slabs of aluminum , the @entity0 offers surprising proof for the virtue of moderation			1
resembling little more than a credit card - sized scrap of exposed circuit board , the @entity0 is a fully programmable pc that runs a free , open - source @entity13 operating system , plugs into any tv , can power 3d graphics , connects to the @entity16 and , with a little ingenuity , be used to create your own personalized robot slave			1
the computer 's miniature frame is crowded with two usb ports , an sd card slot , an @entity25 connection and microchip in the middle -- all powered by a universal @entity30 mobile charger			1

@entity37 , the @entity39 - based @entity38 professor and inventor behind the wallet - friendly pc , says he set out to create a computer so affordable that every child in @entity39 could have one			1
with its rough - around - the - edges aesthetic , however , he did n't expect it to catch on very fast and , in the early days of development , set a sales target of 10,000 units within his lifetime			1
but when the @entity0 launched in february of this year , demand far outran supply , and all 10,000 sold out immediately -- crashing the distributing websites in the process			1
read related : the @entity55 in numbers it turned out there was a voracious appetite -- particularly among a growing class of @entity62 geeks -- for a cheap , easily - programmable , open - source piece of hardware that would allow them to let their imaginations run wild			1
the @entity0 has since be used to power everything from home - made jukeboxes to baby monitors to miniature near - space crafts and digital weather - stations			1
now , far exceeding its inventor 's original estimates , the @entity0 is set to sell as a million units within its first year of availability			1
in a revealing interview with @entity79 , @entity37 tells all about why everyone wants a slice of @entity0			1
@entity79 : what inspired you to invent the @entity0 ? @entity37 : a group of us here at the @entity38 were involved in trying to find 17 , 18 - year - olds to come and study computer science and what we found every year was a reduction in the numbers			1
we went from 500 people in the 1990s applying for our 80 places , down to under 250 and , worse than that , the sorts of things those children knew how to do when they came in the door were much less impressive			2
really @entity0 is an attempt to try and reboot some of that 1980s computer industry feel that had been responsible for giving us this stream of very talented students			1
@entity79 : what in your view are the @entity0 's most distinguishing qualities ? @entity107 : i think we really have to say the big , distinct feature about @entity0 is the cost			1
this is a device that comes in two variants , one that cost $ 25 and one that costs $ 35			2
these are designed to be the same price as a textbook ; they 're designed to be cheap enough that a child can buy on with their pocket money			1
they 're designed to be cheap enough that you could equip a whole classroom for under a $ 1000			2
so , really the cheapness			0
almost everything you can do with a @entity0 , you can do with a conventional pc , but you 'd be doing it at 10 times the cost			1
@entity79 : did you have any idea what kind of response you 'd get ? @entity107 : absolutely not , i think the response has been staggering			0
even a year ago we were thinking of this shifting 10,000 units over a lifetime			0
all we wanted was a few hundred more students -- or for the students we were getting to have had a little more experience when they came to the door			0
@entity79 : what was your own reaction when you heard how many you 'd sold on the first day ? @entity107 : terror , i guess			0
when you 've scaled everything for a particular size and then you discover you have this enormous spike of demand , then you 're always going to wonder if you can fill it			0
and there were big queues , there were back orders for months after that as we and our partners worked very hard to try and scale out production			0
@entity79 : you set out to sell primarily to schools for use by children in class , who 's it actually being bought by ? @entity107 : until september , it was being bought almost entirely by people like me -- technically literate adults who wanted to use it to do interesting projects			2
you know this is something you can plug your television into and play videos on ; it 's got stuff you can use to control a robot			0
for people like me this is gold dust			0
from september onwards we 've started to see a swing round towards what we were hoping for , which is educational engagement -- individual children buying them and schools buying classroom sets of them			2
@entity79 : any other surprise takers ? @entity107 : we 're also starting to see some industrial applications			0
we 're seeing people who have been buying $ 300 industrial computers saying " hang on a second , why am i buying this special purpose computer when i can buy one of these			2
it does the same thing , it runs @entity197			0
my software engineers can be very comfortable with it , why do n't i just switch over to these ? " another really interesting one that i should have anticipated was of course the developing world			0
these make very good entry - level productivity computers for the developing world , so we 're starting to see an interest there as well			2
@entity79 : how are you able to sell it so cheaply ? @entity107 : one of things that allows us to hit our very low price point is that we have a very high level of integration -- there 's just not that much stuff on the board			0
all of the main features are integrated onto the chip in the middle			0
it 's our central processor and also our graphic processor that drives the display and does some of our peripheral functions , so that 's the main chip			0
@entity79 : do you remember the first time you took it into a school and what kind of reaction you got ? @entity107 : we were really surprised by the reaction we got			2
school kids today are used to their tablets and their mobile phones , so we thought we were going to have to put into a shiny box			2
but one of the biggest reactions from the children was because they could actually see it and point to it and tell what the different bits do			0
normally you do n't get to see the green stuff and they really love that , there 's been such a positive response .			0

the @entity0 is a credit - card sized computer that costs little more than a textbook
originally designed to *encourage* school children to learn programming skills
the mini-pc now *hugely* *popular* with @entity62 geeks , who have used it to power their own creations
