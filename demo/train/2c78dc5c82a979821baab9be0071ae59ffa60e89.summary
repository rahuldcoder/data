@entity0 , @entity1 -- a ship billed as the world 's largest skimming vessel has begun testing its effectiveness in the @entity9 , a spokesman for its owner , @entity4 company @entity3 , said saturday			1
the @entity13 has been assigned a 5 - mile - by - 5 - mile area to test its capability , spokesman @entity12 said , citing @entity17 rear adm. @entity16			1
testing is expected to continue saturday and sunday , with initial results probably available monday , @entity12 said			1
the skimmer works by " taking in oily water through a series of vents , or jaws , on the side of the ship and then decanting the intake , " @entity12 said			0
" in many ways , the ship collects water like an actual whale and pumps internally like a human heart			0
" the testing area is just north of the underwater oil gusher , the statement said			1
the @entity13 arrived in the @entity9 on wednesday and has been awaiting approval to join in cleanup efforts			1
the vessel is estimated to be able to skim 21 million gallons of oil a day , at least 250 times the amount that modified fishing vessels currently conducting skimming operations have been able to contain , according to @entity3			2
built this year , the vessel was meant to carry crude oil and iron ore			2
but after hearing about the oil disaster in the @entity9 , @entity3 modified it to become the world 's first large - scale skimmer , spokesman @entity44 said this week			1
researchers have estimated that between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels ( 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons ) of oil have been gushing into the @entity9 daily since april 20 , when the @entity52 oil rig exploded and sank off the coast of @entity1			1
also saturday , response workers recovered boom suspected to have been vandalized in the marshes of @entity58 , @entity1 , the @entity54 said			2
it released several @entity17 photographs of the boom , which appeared to have been cut open			0
" @entity64 vandalism and mishaps involving small craft moving or cutting boom with propellers impedes oil recovery efforts , endangers workers who must return to recover and replace the boom and slows efforts to conduct booming operations elsewhere , " a statement from the center said			2
in an effort to reduce boom damage , the @entity17 has instituted a safety zone around boom sites and established a hotline to report damage			0
meanwhile , @entity79 scientists were set to meet with the agency 's chief saturday to discuss the chemicals @entity83 is using to break up the oil slick			1
agency administrator @entity86 's briefing on dispersants in @entity88 , @entity89 , comes two days after the agency released results from its first round of toxicity testing on eight of the dispersants used in the @entity9			2
the @entity79 study showed that the chemicals , when not mixed with oil , did not significantly disrupt the endocrine systems of marine life			1
but the agency has said it plans to conduct more tests of the toxicity of the dispersant when mixed with crude			2
dispersants have been a key part of @entity83 's cleanup strategy			0
since the beginning of the disaster , more than 1.6 million gallons of the dispersant @entity109 alone have been injected into the @entity9			0
critics say the chemicals could harm marine life			1
but the @entity17 has said that dispersant use is " evaluated daily " and that it 's using the " safest and most effective methods available " to protect the sea environment			0
a @entity2 analysis of daily dispersant reports provided by the @entity121 showed that the chemical dispersants keep flowing into the @entity9 at virtually unchanged levels despite the @entity79 's may 26 order to @entity83 to " significantly " scale back			1
before that date , @entity83 used 25,689 gallons a day of @entity109			0
since then , @entity2 's analysis showed , the daily average of dispersant use has dropped to 23,250 gallons a day , a 9 percent decline			0
over the past few days , bad weather has significantly hampered @entity83 's oil cleanup and collection efforts			0
@entity134 made landfall in northeastern @entity136 late wednesday , but its impact was still felt in the @entity9 days later			0
on friday , more oil than what would fill an @entity141 - sized swimming pool slipped by the cap on @entity83 's ruptured undersea well because of the bad weather , @entity16 said			1
the cap on the well in the @entity9 , bouncing in the rough conditions , captured 20,000 fewer barrels ( 840,000 gallons ) of oil than anticipated , @entity16 said			1
the rough seas also prevented skimming or burning for the past two days , displaced boom and made it unsafe to fly , he said			0
@entity83 spokesman @entity152 noted that forecasters expect rough seas to calm a bit this weekend			0
crews are standing by to resume skimming operations and survey inland waterways that may have been affected because of a storm surge			0
@entity161 cleanup operations continue with limited weather interruption			0
for the 12 - hour period from midnight until noon friday , approximately 8,665 barrels of oil were collected and about 4,155 barrels of oil and 28.6 million cubic feet of natural gas were flared , @entity83 said			1
thursday 's total oil recovered was approximately 25,150 barrels			2
newly retired @entity17 adm. @entity169 announced friday that since june , the skimming capability in the @entity9 has increased more than fivefold , from approximately 100 large skimmers to 550 skimming vessels of various sizes working to collect oil in all parts of the region as			2
to date , 28.2 million gallons of an oil - water mix have been skimmed from the @entity9 's surface			1
@entity2 's @entity179 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity13 assigned 5 - mile - by - 5 - mile area for testing
testing to continue saturday and sunday ; initial results likely monday
@entity79 plans to test impact of chemical - oil mix on marine life
containment cap bounced friday , allowing 20,000 barrels to get by
