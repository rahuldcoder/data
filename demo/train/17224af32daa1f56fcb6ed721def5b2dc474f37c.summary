-- the would - be assassin of @entity3 's prince @entity2 hid his bomb in his underwear , apparently believing that cultural taboos would prevent a search in that part of his body , according to a @entity3 government official close to the investigation			1
@entity3 's prince @entity2 , head of counterterrorism , was slightly injured in august			1
the prince was slightly injured when the bomb exploded in the august attack			0
several news reports this week have said the assailant hid the bomb inside his rectum , but according to the @entity3 official , the government assessment discounted those reports , based on various factors			1
among them : when the bomb went off there was a flash of light , suggesting that the bomb was not hidden inside the assassin 's body			0
also , doctors consulted by the government judged that the toxicity of the plastic explosives would make them hard to hold for many hours inside the rectum , and the environment in this area of the body would make detonation " difficult , " according to the @entity3 official close to the investigation			1
the @entity3 said they think the bomb weighed 100 grams and was made with a plastic explosive , to avoid detection by metal detectors through which the would - be assassin had to pass before he was allowed to meet with the prince			1
the official said the explosive was @entity45 , which was used by the so - called shoe bomber @entity46 , who attempted to blow up an @entity48 flight between @entity49 , @entity50 , and @entity51 , @entity52 , in december 2001			2
the @entity3 are exploring the possibility that the prince 's assailant exploded the device using a detonator that used a chemical fuse , which would not be detected by a metal detector			1
the would - be assassin -- a @entity3 member of @entity61 who had fled to @entity62 , identified as @entity63 -- posed as a member of the terror group willing to surrender personally to @entity66			2
@entity66 is responsible for overseeing the kingdom 's terrorist rehabilitation program , and some two dozen important members of @entity61 previously have surrendered to him in person , according to the @entity3 government official			2
during the month of @entity72 , traditionally a time of repentance in the @entity75 world , @entity63 gained an audience with the prince at his private residence in @entity79 , presenting himself as someone who could also persuade other militants to surrender			0
under the cover of pretending that he was reaching out to other militants to surrender , @entity63 briefly called other members of @entity61 to tell them that he was standing by @entity66			0
after finishing the call , the bomb blew up , killing @entity63 but only slightly injuring the prince , who was a few feet away from his would - be assassin			0
the @entity3 government official characterized the prince 's narrow escape as a " miracle			0
