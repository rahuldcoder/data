@entity0 -- the cherry blossoms are in full bloom , the skies clear and blue in this seaside town			0
yet apart from the occasional bark of a dog or the moo of a meandering cow , the most glaring aspect about life in @entity13 is the lack of it			2
@entity17 's government five weeks ago mandated that everyone must leave the town , amid concerns about dangerously high levels of radiation emanating from the stricken @entity24 nuclear power plant about eight kilometers ( five miles ) away			1
but @entity25 felt he had to go home			2
so , with a @entity17 journalist and cameraman alongside , he got in a car and headed toward @entity13 , where he and many others had n't been since the 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck on march 11			1
they drove with ease past signs that read " @entity40 " stationed 20 kilometers ( 12.5 miles ) from the power plant , meaning they 'd entered the so - called " evacuation zone			2
" going farther , their main barriers were not police but occasional roads that had been cracked and heaved by the epic tremor			0
cruising down @entity13 's tree - lined streets , @entity25 saw many stores , residences and other buildings that , while damaged , were largely intact			1
but the eerie silence reminded him how it had transformed into a ghost town , save for a few animals left to fend for themselves			0
@entity54 , @entity17 announce joint rebuilding effort " there was nobody there , so i finally understood everyone had really left , " he said			2
" i could see dogs and cows belonging to my neighbor			2
i was surprised cows could get so skinny after just one month			0
" @entity25 's first stop was his mother 's house , closing windows and blinds that had been left wide open			1
then , he moved on to the family business -- a funeral parlor -- where flowers for services that never took place littered the floor			0
his last stop was his own home , carefully stepping past his belongings , which had been flung everywhere by the earthquake			0
in between picking up his dvd collection and unplugging the electricity , @entity25 searched for bank records and identification cards			0
as he returned to @entity0 , where he 's been in government housing , @entity25 could n't help but feel that part of him -- his sense of security growing up in the shadows of the @entity24 plant -- had been lost due to the nonstop nuclear crisis			1
enduring psychological and emotional stress he said he 's angry with the @entity91 , which runs the plant and has led the often problematic recovery operation , for convincing him at a young age that the nuclear facility was completely safe			1
beyond that , @entity25 said he is losing hope that he 'll ever return home for good			0
he is one of more than 78,000 people who lived within a 20 - kilometer radius of @entity24 who were ordered to flee , on top of another 60,000 - plus in the next 10 kilometers who were told to shelter indoors			0
and @entity17 's government recently told residents of several towns outside that zone that they would soon have to evacuate , due to possible long - term health risks from radioactive particles			1
" two weeks ago , i thought i would be back home within six months , " @entity25 said saturday			1
" but the situation ( at the nuclear plant ) got worse and worse			1
" now i doubt i will ever be able to go back			0

@entity25 went to his *hometown* of @entity13 , @entity17 , which has been evacuated
the town is about 8 kilometers from the nuclear plant that 's been in crisis since march 11
he says he found the town was totally *abandoned* , except for dogs and some cows
angry at the plant 's owner , @entity25 says , " i doubt i will ever be able to go back "
