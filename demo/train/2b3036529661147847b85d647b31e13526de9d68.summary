-- in the wake of the attempted bombing of a @entity7 - bound flight on christmas day , security experts , political commentators and the media have been asking one question : how can the @entity9 prevent terrorists from smuggling homemade bombs through security ? the most frequent answer has been full body scanners , a developing technology used in a handful of airports around the world			2
although these scanners may be effective , they are at best the right answer to the wrong question			2
the question that law enforcement and security professionals must ask is how to prevent the terrorists themselves from getting on the airplane			2
once we focus our attention on individual terrorists rather than their potential weapons , one fact is immediately clear : we must completely change the way we go about airport security and counterterrorism in general			2
the procedures are both inadequate and ineffective			2
the current random searches do only a minimum to improve security			0
nothing is more unproductive than searching an 80 - year - old woman in a wheelchair from @entity44 or a 3 - year - old child simply because she or he was the 10th person in line			0
quite simply , the system has failed and must be revamped			0
recognizing existing deficiencies , on monday the @entity49 announced it has taken the first step toward implementing a revised screening process for airline passengers			1
@entity49 will mandate that " every individual flying into the @entity9 from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening			1
" this is a step in the right direction			0
but more should be done			0
instead of a system akin to searching for a needle in a haystack while blindfolded , the @entity65 and the intelligence community should institute a system of " smart screening			1
" such a revised screening process would consider a host of factors in determining whether someone is a potential security threat			2
among the considerations would be : behavioral signs ; appearance ; itinerary and travel history ; appearance on watch lists ; known connections to radical organizations or individuals ; and yes , ethnicity and religious identity			1
recognizing that the inclusion of ethnicity and religious characteristics in this list may be unsettling , it simply can not be ignored that the overwhelmingly large majority of terrorist attacks undertaken over the past decade were committed by @entity97 fundamentalists			1
consequently , to ignore it as a factor -- as does current policy -- could have devastating effects			2
the procedures are both inadequate and ineffective			0
the current random searches do only a minimum to improve security			0
any characteristic that can help us identify followers of radical @entity97 would be critical to determining who should be denied a visa , who should be put on the no - fly list and who should be subjected to a secondary inspection at the airport			1
one point worth mentioning is that a proposal for " smart screening " is not a call for a ban on @entity122 flying on planes , nor is it an attempt to stop every person with @entity126 features and put them on a watch list			1
rather than an accusation of guilt , it is simply an additional investigative tool that will allow law enforcement officials to effectively and efficiently marshal their resources toward a known threat , that posed by violent adherents of radical @entity97 theology			1
screeners and officials of intelligence agencies need as much information as possible to make decisions			1
to ban the use of critically relevant criteria in preventing catastrophic acts of terrorism , a policy in effect today , is to deny intelligence officials all the tools they need to make critical decisions			1
law enforcement has done criminal profiling for decades and recognizes it as an invaluable tool			0
if a child is raped , the first suspects logically are pedophiles			0
skeptical that " smart screening " will be effective ? @entity159 , the intended 20th hijacker from the september 11 attacks , was stopped in @entity161 , @entity162 , in 2001 because of profiling			1
it must be conceded that this proposal may not be 100 percent effective			0
no system ever will be			0
however , as terrorist groups consistently demonstrate their adaptability , one thing that has remained relatively constant is the pool of willing and able recruits			0
if some of the most well - trained and effective terrorists can not carry out their mission because of profiling , that makes the likelihood of a successful terrorist attack that much slimmer			0
the new operatives may be less well - trained and hence less deadly			0
what they will undoubtedly have in common with their more experienced brethren , regardless of their ethnicity or nationality , will be an adherence to radical @entity97			1
rather than calling for an all - encompassing program where all followers of @entity97 would be swept up in some sort of dragnet , law enforcement officials should be provided with all of the tools necessary to prevent acts of terrorism , including the ability to consider the potential that an individual getting on an airplane has been radicalized			1
race and ethnicity should never be sole criteria in evaluating threats			2
rather i am calling for consideration of such criteria only in addition to many other factors			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : new @entity49 rules for screening passengers good start , but more needs to be done
@entity207 : ca *n't* ignore @entity97 radicals carried out most terror attacks over the past decade
" smart screening " means behavior , travel history , watch lists , ethnicity , religion
screeners , intelligence officials need as much information as possible , he argues
