@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's seafood distribution business is a family affair			1
in the industrial warehouse that houses @entity11 and @entity12 on the west side of @entity0 , his wife , @entity8 , and four of his seven children load trucks , take phone calls , enter data and help care for his infant grandson , who has a playpen in @entity21 's office			2
but with portions of @entity1 's controversial immigration enforcement law set to take effect thursday , the business is in limbo			1
" if people are not eating , we 're not selling , " said @entity27 , a family friend who works in the back office			0
" we 've lost 60 percent of sales , and right now the future 's uncertain			1
we do n't know if we 're going to stay in the state ; we do n't know if we 're going to close the business			1
everything 's up in the air			2
" most of their clients cater to the @entity41 community , which has effectively gone into hiding amid concerns that they may have to leave the state as soon as the bill becomes law , @entity27 said			1
a key part of @entity1 's immigration law was temporarily blocked by a judge wednesday			1
this means police wo n't be required to ask people about their immigration status			2
@entity54 : what does @entity1 immigration ruling mean ? but for the @entity21 family business and others like it , the damage from the controversy already is done			1
reduced spending in restaurants , grocery and retail stores has triggered a domino effect among businesses in the metro @entity0 business community and throughout @entity1			2
to stay afloat even as their clients disappear or reduce inventory orders , the business has reduced employees ' hours and cut back operations in the industrial warehouse , home to several large freezers and forklifts and an office sparsely decorated with posters of illustrated fish and cuts of meat			2
perhaps the toughest decision was to halt lines of credit to customers , even those with good history , she said			0
" we ca n't really offer credit anymore because we do n't know if next week they 're going to close the business , " @entity27 said			2
" but it 's also a downside because some customers need that credit to operate			2
" firm numbers illuminating the economic fallout of @entity100 are hard to come by as the bill has yet to take effect			2
also , summer tends to be slow for business and tourism in @entity1 because it 's so hot			1
but anecdotal evidence from business owners , real estate agents and community leaders indicates the mere specter of the bill has created a culture of fear among @entity41 in @entity1 that 's slowly paralyzing sectors of the economy			1
@entity41 make up 30 percent of the state 's population			1
the state 's unemployment rate in june rose for the third month in a row , to 9.7 percent			1
gov. @entity121 signed the bill in april			1
traditionally , community groups look to indicators such as the housing market , school enrollment and data from utility companies to track economic fluctuations within a certain group , said @entity131 , president and ceo of @entity133 , a community outreach program in @entity0			0
based on feedback from clients and preliminary data , @entity131 said his group estimates that rental vacancies in predominantly @entity41 neighborhoods will be 10 to 15 percent higher than the normal rate of 12 percent			1
" people are scared , and they do n't want to wait around to find out what 's going to happen with @entity100 , " said @entity131 , whose group offers housing , economic and education services to low - income families and individuals , both undocumented and @entity148 - born			2
" regardless of their status , people are frustrated with an environment that 's not accepting and potentially threatening , and they 're fed up with being targeted and singled out by law enforcement			0
it 's driving them out of the state , and not necessarily to better situations			1
" reactions to the @entity1 immigration law injunction the @entity1 housing market , which was already suffering from one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country , has also taken an extra hit since the passage of the law , according to real estate agents who spoke with @entity2			1
some homeowners who purchased property in the past year are looking to unload , according to @entity169 , a real estate agent who sells residential properties in neighborhoods in @entity0 's @entity41 communities			1
" most families usually have one person who does n't have papers , and they do n't want to risk being arrested and splitting up the family by staying in @entity1 , " said @entity169 , who is married to one of the daughters of @entity4 , the owner of @entity11 and @entity12			0
even during the recession , @entity169 said business was good because property was cheap , and that in better times , he closed an average of five transactions a month			1
since the beginning of the year , however , he has been lucky to sell two properties in a month , and in july , he has n't closed a single deal			0
" i had investors buying properties , but now 's who gon na rent them ? " he said			0
commercial real estate developer @entity193 was in the same situation leading up to wednesday 's ruling			1
since april , clients in predominantly @entity41 neighborhoods across the state had been pulling out of properties or calling to relay concerns over whether they should stay if the law goes into effect			1
today , @entity193 said he received several calls from clients expressing relief and letting him know they intended to stay			0
" the ruling today has definitely been a move in the right direction for commercial tenants and their customers , who 've been scared that @entity1 was n't going be friendly to @entity214 community , " he said			0
" this gives the federal government to get to work implementing an immigration policy that the @entity148 people will support unanimously and deals with the situation at the border , which is where the real problem is			1
" @entity0 's sprawling concrete landscape bears testimony to the abundance of vacant residential and commercial property			0
" for sale " signs in @entity228 and @entity231 adorn brown , sun - scorched lawns and dilapidated parking lots alike , from the heart of downtown @entity0 to as far as @entity234 and @entity235 -- the district of @entity100 's sponsor , @entity238 sen. @entity238			0
boarded - up big - box stores loom large in their vast emptiness , and rows of abandoned strip mall storefronts outnumber those that are occupied in some parts			0
not only businesses targeting the @entity41 community are suffering			2
economic boycotts adopted by other states and cities have hit @entity1 's meeting and convention business			2
since groups nationwide began announcing boycotts of the state because of @entity100 , at least 40 meetings have been canceled			0
that 's resulted in the loss of $ 12 million in lodging alone , according to @entity259 , spokeswoman for the @entity260			0
summer is typically the low season , she noted , and pointed out that tourism was up 8 percent statewide in june 2010 compared with june 2009 , which was one of the " worst summers ever " because of the recession			0
despite that slight uptick , more telling is the lack of inquiries for future bookings , she said			0
" what we 're hearing from meeting planners now is they wo n't and ca n't consider @entity1 for 2011 , 2012 meetings not necessarily because of their own stance on @entity100 or the boycott but just because they want to avoid the controversy and do n't want to risk losing attendance , " she said			0
the absence of meetings and conventions not only affects the hotel industry and its 200,000 employees , but also ancillary businesses such as restaurants , retailers and taxis , @entity259 said			0
it seems that not even fast - food joints are immune to the encroaching economic fallout of @entity100			0
as the four @entity4 children stood with their parents in their office wednesday , recounting tales of friends and relatives who have left town or seen families torn apart , daughter @entity293 noted her surprise at seeing a shuttered @entity303			0
" i was driving down @entity304 with my dad and @entity303 was closed , and i was like , when have you seen that ? like @entity303 -- everybody goes to @entity303 , and that was closed down			0
