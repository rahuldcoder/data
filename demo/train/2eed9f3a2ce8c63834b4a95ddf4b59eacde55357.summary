-- there was a time when singer - actress @entity3 was considered as clean cut as they come			1
@entity3 , at the 2009 @entity6 , is being spotted with @entity7			1
once hailed as a country music ing√©nue , she first captivated fans as a 13 - year - old with a mature - beyond - her - years voice and a poised stage presence			0
after selling millions of records and amassing @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity3 was often held up as an example of a child star who managed to avoid the pitfalls of fame and emerge with a successful career and a happy marriage			1
then rumors surfaced that she was allegedly having an affair with actor @entity7			1
now the two have both separated from their respective spouses and the ensuing scandal has cast a shadow over @entity30 ' wholesome , good - girl image			2
" i kind of feel like the public 's perception is changing towards her , " said @entity31 , staff editor for @entity32			2
" she had n't even announced [ her ] divorce yet and here she was on a beach in @entity37 [ @entity37 ] , wearing a little bikini with @entity7 rubbing suntan lotion all over her			1
she 's like flaunting their relationship while her husband is piecing together his life in @entity45 on his own			2
" such relationship woes among celebrities are as old as @entity48 itself			0
stories of celebrity hookups on movie sets , be it @entity53 and @entity55 in the 1960s or @entity56 and @entity57 in the 21st century , are the stuff of which tabloid dreams are made			0
but @entity3 , who married former dancer @entity60 in 2002 when she was 19 and he 21 , seemed an unlikely candidate to star in such a drama			1
unlike other young celebrity couples , @entity3 and @entity60 were unlikely tabloid targets , choosing to live quietly and often being captured smiling and embracing on the red carpet			1
the pair appeared devoted to each other and seemed to take a swipe at critics of their young love when they reportedly held a " seven year itch " party to toast their union			0
in her book , " @entity77 , " @entity3 wrote glowingly of her spouse			1
" my husband , @entity78 , has changed my heart -- and life -- in more ways than i can ever imagine , " she wrote			2
" we met in @entity83 when i was hosting the @entity84			0
it was almost an instant attraction			0
" rumors began swirling about the singer and " csi : @entity91 " actor @entity7 after they co-starred in the @entity93 movie " @entity94			1
" during an interview with @entity96 in april on the " today " show , @entity3 sidestepped questioning about her relationship with @entity7			1
" i refuse to discuss tabloid rumors , " @entity3 said			1
" i 've grown up in the press my entire life			0
i think people are fascinated by my personal life , and i totally get it			0
" soon after , @entity7 's wife and mother of his two young sons , @entity108 , was quoted as demanding @entity30 leave her husband alone			1
now , @entity108 is being as vocal about the breakup of her and @entity7 's marriage			1
she told people in august that she sensed her husband was attracted to @entity30 after double - dating with the singer and @entity60			2
@entity3 and @entity7 have been seen publicly golfing , vacationing and attending a concert			1
she announced on her web site that she and @entity60 were ending their marriage			0
@entity118 , president of @entity119 , said fans are often very forgiving of stars for their bad behavior			0
" the public is very tolerant of a wide range of behaviors from celebrities , " said @entity118			0
" to the extent the public truly expected her to be someone with a clean - cut image , she may lose some fans there			2
" " on the other hand , there are some people who like celebrities who lead racy , unpredictable lives , so she could gain fans at the same time			0
" @entity118 , the author of " keeping the @entity138 at @entity139 ; a @entity144 , " said , " everybody wants to read the juicy gossip , " but @entity3 could mitigate potential damage to her career if she is real and does " not pretend to be one thing and then be the other			1
" " people like watching real - life soap operas , " he said			0
" ultimately , if people love [ @entity30 ' ] singing , they are going to come to her concerts			0
" @entity32 's @entity151 said @entity3 and @entity7 's situation mirrors that of actress @entity153 and her husband , @entity154			1
like @entity3 and @entity7 , @entity153 and @entity154 were both married to others when they met on the set of a @entity93 movie in 2005			1
@entity153 and @entity154 divorced their spouses , married and now are the parents of two children and stars of their own reality show on @entity164			0
as was the case with fans who rallied around @entity167 because they believed she had been wronged by @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity151 said she believes @entity3 ' estranged husband , @entity60 , will emerge the winner of public sympathy			1
" celebrity history will show that people tend to feel bad for the person who is scorned , " @entity151 said			0
" i think people are always going to feel bad for [ @entity175 ] with the fact that @entity3 not only left him after seven years of marriage , but ran off with this man she met on the set of her movie			2
" @entity182 of @entity183 , @entity184 , has run the fan site @entity186 since 1995 and said the singer has a supportive fan base			0
all of the media surrounding @entity3 has not decreased her admiration for the singer , @entity182 said			2
" the recent stories do n't at all change how i feel about @entity3 , " @entity182 said			2
" what has happened is between them			0
i love the person that she is and tabloid stories with quotes from supposed " friends " are not going to change that			0
