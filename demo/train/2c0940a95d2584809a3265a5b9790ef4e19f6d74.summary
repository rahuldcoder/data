-- on the backs of @entity3 , iphones and @entity5 , and on the bottom of @entity8 laptops , an inscription reads : " designed by @entity9 in @entity10			1
" the parts themselves come from more than 150 companies from various parts of the world			2
the majority of those antennas , glass , metal , sensors and silicon are manufactured overseas			0
how @entity9 finds parts and manufactures its products , almost entirely abroad , is standard protocol in the technology industry			1
electronics companies say @entity30 manufacturing plants are more affordable and more versatile than those found anywhere else in the world			1
but as the most valuable tech company in the world , @entity9 is seen by many as a role model in business			2
and its reliance on cheap overseas labor -- most notably at factories in @entity12 run by manufacturer @entity42 -- has come under increased scrutiny in recent media coverage by @entity0 , the @entity45 and other outlets			2
@entity42 , owned by @entity42 , counts @entity9 among its business clients , which also include @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and many other tech giants			2
@entity9 has reported violations at its facilities , and @entity42 has come under fire for a slew of worker suicides in 2010 and conditions that workers - rights groups say are inhumane			2
workers at @entity42 and other plants in @entity30 must stay busy to keep up with the world 's seemingly insatiable demand for @entity9 products			1
during the last three months of 2011 , @entity9 sold 37 million iphones , 15.4 million @entity5 , 15.4 million ipods and 5.2 million @entity8 computers , according to the company 's financial report			1
that netted @entity9 $ 46.3 billion in revenue and $ 13.1 billion in profit , which is double what @entity9 made during the same period a year before			0
where does all that profit come from ? take the @entity74 , for example			0
the @entity76 sells for $ 199 if the customer signs a two - year cellular contract			0
but @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 pay @entity9 much more for the phones in order to sell them at a lower price , a process called subsidizing			0
to get a so - called " unlocked " or contract - free @entity74 , expect to pay at least $ 649 to @entity9			0
the costs of parts and manufacturing for @entity9 's @entity76 is estimated to be $ 196 , according to industry research firm @entity90			1
that 's $ 453 less than @entity9 charges for a contract - free phone			1
marketing and research can add up , but no matter which way you cut it , @entity9 is making a sizable profit on each phone it sells , said @entity90 analyst @entity100			0
@entity9 has more than 60,000 employees , most of whom work in its retail stores			0
to build parts and assemble products , @entity9 has a long list of partners			1
that 's partly done to avoid being dependent on any one manufacturer and to get favorable deals on each part from the many competing companies			0
still , @entity9 tries to minimize the number of companies with which it signs deals , @entity100 said			0
that way , @entity9 wields more influence because it 's among the biggest - spending clients , he said			1
" they 'd rather be a mile deep in a supplier than divide the business up amongst five , " @entity100 said			0
" you 're going to take care of your biggest customers first			0
" in its supplier report , @entity9 says 156 companies account for 97 % of the money spent on materials , manufacturing and assembly for its coveted gadgets			1
when the client is a powerhouse like @entity9 , winning a contract to be one of those 156 is a major event			0
in @entity139 parlance , it moves stock			0
being anointed by @entity9 boosts a supplier 's credibility , but @entity9 is a shrewd negotiator , from how it develops an @entity5 to how it leases or builds the retail store it 's sold in			1
this reportedly forces @entity9 's partners to push workers and cut corners in order to wring profits			1
@entity9 told @entity0 in a statement that its expectations for suppliers to operate responsibly increase each year			1
@entity9 says it conducted 229 audits of suppliers last year and reported its findings publicly online			2
" we care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain , " @entity9 said in the statement			0
" we insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect , and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever @entity9 products are made			1
our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with @entity9			2

the parts and manufacturing for @entity9 products mostly happens overseas
it 's common for *consumer* electronics to be built in @entity30 factories
@entity9 has more than 150 suppliers and manufacturers for its products
