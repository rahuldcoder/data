-- all eyes will be on @entity2 and @entity3 when @entity4 face the @entity5 in the @entity7 semifinal in @entity8 to discover who will meet @entity10 in the final			1
the @entity12 will be looking to their mercurial winger to steer them to a second successive @entity7 final while @entity4 will likely need some @entity2 magic if they are to reach a first final in 24 years			1
both men have been central to the success of their sides so far in the competition earning glowing tributes from team managers past and present			0
@entity4 coach @entity26 said his midfield maestro was like " water in the desert " following his side 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity32 in the quarterfinals			1
" each time he gets the ball , it represents hope for all of us and a threatening situation for our opponents , " @entity26 told reporters after the game			0
" regardless of whether he scores goals or not , his influence is decisive			0
a game has many aspects , apart from goals			0
" when you have a player such as @entity2 , who never , or almost never , loses the ball , it 's water in the desert and not just when he scores			2
" @entity12 praise for @entity3 has been equally fulsome			1
former @entity12 coach @entity54 , who steered the @entity5 to the final in 2010 , believes @entity3 may be a better player than the @entity57 midfielder			1
" @entity4 have got @entity2 , we 've got @entity3			1
and quite frankly , i think the better player is @entity3 , " @entity54 told @entity12 broadcaster nos tv			1
" four years ago , @entity3 was injured just before the start of the tournament in a friendly against @entity64			1
he was carrying the injury for the whole tournament and was never really 100 %			0
but this year he 's been unstoppable			0
" current teammate @entity67 has also lauded the @entity70 star 's contribution in @entity71			2
" i would n't swap @entity3 for any player in the world , " @entity67 told @entity72 earlier in the tournament			0
" he is having an amazing @entity7			0
he 's scored goals and created goals , he 's so fast and he is a very important player for us			0
" three goals and one assist at the finals attest to @entity3 's value , though he 's also attracted plenty of criticism for his theatrical habit of going down in the penalty area during the tournament			2
coach @entity87 will need the 30 - year - old to put in a flawless performance if the @entity12 are to progress			2
as @entity26 has hinted , two - time champions @entity4 are perhaps even more reliant on @entity2			1
the 27 - year - old has scored half of @entity4 's eight goals in the competition so far			2
with @entity100 ruled out with a thigh injury , strikers @entity96 and @entity98 ( if passed fit ) will be relying on @entity2 more than ever to set them free in front of goal			2
with three @entity110 awards , three @entity105 winners medals and six @entity107 titles to his name , @entity2 would seal his place in football 's pantheon if he became the first @entity114 since @entity115 to lift the trophy			2
but he 's not getting carried away just yet			0
" to play a @entity7 final with the great atmosphere of the @entity119 is something what every player dreams of , but first we have to make sure we get there , " @entity2 said , @entity72 reported			1
previous matches between the two sides have produced moments of individual brilliance -- @entity131 's exquisite 90th - minute winner in the quarterfinal in 1998 was one of the greatest goals ever seen at a @entity7 finals			1
twenty - four years earlier it was @entity137 who was strutting his stuff , scoring two goals for the @entity12 in a 4 - 0 win at the 1974 finals hosted and won by @entity10			1
@entity4 's only victory against the @entity5 at a @entity7 came in the 1978 final -- legendary striker @entity143 scoring twice in a 3 - 1 extra time win at the @entity145 in @entity146			1
for all the attacking flair on the pitch , the result , in the end , may hinge on the tactical nous of the men in suits standing on the touchline			0
since taking over in 2011 , @entity26 has overseen just four losses in 39 matches			0
@entity157 , meanwhile , has seen his side lose just twice in 26 matches during his second stint as the national coach			0
the 62 - year - old , who will take over as manager at @entity165 side @entity164 after the @entity7 finishes , has won plaudits for some cunning substitutions during the finals			1
the introduction of @entity171 late in the game against @entity173 helped turn the tide in the @entity177 side 's favor			0
the @entity179 striker , who came on for @entity180 in the 76th minute , laid off the ball for @entity183 's sumptuous 88th - minute strike before scoring a penalty in injury time as the @entity5 snatched a 2 - 1 victory			1
against @entity188 in the quarterfinals , @entity157 sent on goalkeeper @entity189 in the dying seconds of extra time			0
the bold move worked as the @entity193 keeper pulled off two saves in the shootout to send the @entity12 into the semis and a step closer to a first @entity7 title			1
" maybe @entity200 does have a golden willy , " @entity3 cheekily said following the last - gasp win over @entity173 in the last 16			2
on wednesday we may be one step closer to finding out .			0

@entity4 and the @entity5 contest @entity7 semifinal in @entity8
