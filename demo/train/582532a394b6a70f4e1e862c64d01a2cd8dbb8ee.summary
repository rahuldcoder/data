-- latino voters went into the midterm election tuesday feeling like bystanders in an @entity5 political process that is broken			0
an election eve poll of 5,000 latinos who said they already had voted , or intended to vote , tuesday was particularly telling -- more than half reported that no one had contacted them to ask for their vote			2
that 's right , no one -- not a political campaign , not a candidate , not a community organization			1
perhaps partly as a result , their motivation for voting was deeply personal , with more than a third saying they were voting to show their support for the @entity26 community rather than for a @entity28 or @entity29 candidate			1
such views are consistent with the research we have conducted at the @entity33 over the past four years , among " @entity34 " -- latino @entity5 citizens who are unlikely to vote because they believe the political system does not work for them and their families , and that political promises are made and easily broken			0
when they are engaged and asked to vote , they do so not for themselves , but for their families and community			0
this lack of engagement with the two parties did not stop @entity33 projecting that 7.8 million latinos would vote in this election , up from the 6.6 million who voted in 2010			0
and although it is too early to know if we hit that mark , we do know this much -- latino voters are as angry about @entity53 paralysis as other @entity5			0
( the lack of movement on immigration reform , an issue that for the second consecutive national election ranked as the no. 1 issue for @entity26 voters , was simply @entity61 in a list of reasons why the community is frustrated )			1
yet the failure of lawmakers to address the key issues of interest for @entity26 voters is particularly perplexing when we look at what happens when politicians do take these voters into account			2
@entity73 , one of the few states with both a large @entity26 electorate and a competitive @entity77 race , underscored how it is possible for candidates to reinvent themselves and win an election by softening their approach and addressing the issues of key importance to the @entity26 community			1
@entity85 , who had opposed immigration reform , was able to transform himself as a candidate by addressing the issues and focusing on compromise			0
perhaps this helps explain why incumbent @entity91 , who largely ignored the issue of immigration in hopes of not alienating non-latinos , lost -- despite 71 % of @entity26 voters polled in @entity73 having said they would vote for him			2
many likely felt disinclined to vote for @entity91 , reflecting the reality that @entity26 voters are not monolithic , and their vote is up for grabs if parties and candidates speak to their issues			1
looking ahead to 2016 , the campaign for the @entity105 begins today , and a presidential election has a completely different dynamic than a mid-term election			0
as each of the past four presidential elections has demonstrated , the road to the @entity105 goes through the @entity26 community , and amassing the required @entity113 votes requires victory in states where @entity26 voters make the difference			1
this was true in @entity119 's successful elections in 2000 and 2004 , just as it was for @entity122 's campaigns in 2008 and 2012			0
what happens next in @entity53 on immigration reform , and the other top issues for @entity26 voters -- jobs and the economy , education and health care -- will set the stage for the next election			2
with this in mind , the next would - be president must not only reach out and directly connect with @entity26 voters on the issues that most matter to them , but also show that he , or she , is from a party that is able to deliver action as well .			1

motivation for voting in midterms was deeply personal , says @entity142
many @entity145 reported voting for community rather than for party candidate , he says
@entity142 : race for @entity77 seat showed @entity26 votes are up for grabs
