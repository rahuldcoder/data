@entity0 , @entity1 -- a budding @entity4 director is enjoying success on a shoestring at @entity0 with " @entity7 , " a new zombie feature that cost a scarcely believable $ 70 to make			1
" @entity7 " director @entity9 who spent 18 months making the film , working nights at a private car hire firm			1
@entity15 distributors are currently in negotiations for the rights to the film and buzz around the no - budget zombie chiller has attracted interest from some major @entity23 distributors -- all of which is a very nice surprise for the team behind " @entity7			1
" " we were almost fainting at the list of people who were coming [ to the final market screening of the film ] , " said @entity27 who is helping the film 's director @entity9 publicize the film in @entity0			1
" representatives from major @entity23 distributors -- some of the @entity39 studios			2
" " when we say it 's a low budget film , people presume a couple of hundred thousand [ dollars ]			0
people ca n't figure out how it 's possible			0
what @entity9 's achieved has left people astonished			0
" it was by advertising for volunteer zombies on social networking site @entity50 , borrowing make - up from @entity39 blockbusters and teaching himself how to produce special effects that thrifty director price was able to make the film for less than the price of a zombie dvd box set			1
" the approach was to say to people , ' ok guys , we do n't have any money , so bring your own equipment , ' " the the 30 year - old director told @entity2			0
with help from a makeshift band of friends and volunteers , @entity9 shot and edited the feature -- which ingeniously spins the zombie genre on its head by telling the story entirely from the zombie 's perspective -- over a period of 18 months while working nights part - time as a booker for a taxi company			1
online social networking was an invaluable tool in both generating buzz and cheaply sourcing the undead : " we went on @entity50 and @entity85 and said ' who wants to be a zombie ? ' " @entity9 told @entity2			1
" we managed to get 50 brilliantly made up zombies and stuff them into a living room			0
" in keeping with @entity9 's beg and borrow approach , most of the zombie make - up in the make - up artists ' cases was inherited from other movies			2
" one of our make - up people came off ' @entity100 , ' so we were having the same latex that was put on @entity102 , " he told @entity2			0
@entity9 says he came up with the idea to make a no - budget film because he realized that he and his friends would never be able to scrape together enough money to make even a low - budget film			2
" a couple of friends were round a few years ago watching @entity111 's ' @entity110 , ' recalls @entity9			0
" and we were lamenting the fact that we could never make a zombie film -- we would n't be able to acquire a budget			0
" " then i just woke up before everyone else -- i was probably a bit hungover -- and i wondered if a zombie movie from a zombie 's perspective had been done before			2
" the end result is " @entity7 , " a zombie film " with a heart , " @entity9 says , shot using production values cribbed from endless re-watching of making - of featurettes and director 's commentaries from his personal @entity130 collection			1
zombie fan web site @entity132 called it " as original , compelling and thought provoking as [ @entity135 ] @entity111 's ' @entity134 , ' " while horror magazine scars predicted it would " revolutionize zombie cinema			0
" @entity9 hopes that the film will generate enough interest to kick - start his career and allow him to make another film			2
" hopefully we 'll be able to generate some interest and maybe try to get some kind of a budget for our next film -- maybe a bigger budget , Â£ 100 , i do n't know			0
" @entity9 's cost - effective filmmaking may make him the envy of film executives sweating over whether their latest projects will break even , but even " @entity7 " may suffer at the market : " in a strange way it 's kind of counter-productive			1
" anyone involved in sales will say , ' oh , it cost [ $ 70 ] , well how much do you expect us to pay for that ? ' but with the current economic climate it seems to be a great way to make movies			2
" so , what exactly did @entity9 spend the famous $ 70 on ? " we bought a crowbar and a couple of tapes , and i think we got some tea and coffee as well -- not the expensive stuff either , the very basic kind , " @entity9 told @entity2			1
" just to keep the zombies happy			0
