@entity0 -- the estranged wife of actor @entity3 said wednesday she is n't trying to extort any money from her husband as they go through a contentious divorce and the former " @entity9 " star is the subject of child molestation allegations			1
the allegations surfaced tuesday after celebrity news site @entity13 posted an audio recording that purports to have been made during a november 2012 therapy session involving @entity3 and his wife , @entity17			1
the accusations against the actor best known for playing a pastor on " @entity9 , " which ran for 11 years , are explosive			0
in the recording , the website says , @entity3 made incriminating statements			1
they are similar to those @entity25 accuses him of in divorce filings , namely that he admitted to her that he molested three underage girls			2
neither @entity3 ' attorney nor his agent have returned any of @entity1 's numerous calls			1
but in a court filing in the couple 's divorce , @entity25 claimed @entity3 , now 67 , had " been engaging in a long - term pattern of sexually molesting children			1
" @entity3 ' lawyer fired back , saying in his client 's legal response that her claims were " really an attempt to extort concessions in settlement			1
" on wednesday , @entity25 released a statement denying she wants more than half of the marital assets			0
" this is a deeply sad situation for everyone involved			0
with regard to the divorce proceedings , i am seeking no more than that to which i am legally entitled under the laws of the @entity57 , " she said			2
@entity13 also reported wednesday that " @entity3 ' people " said @entity25 was using the recording from the therapy session as a means to getting a larger settlement			1
her divorce lawyer , @entity63 , said the accusation is untrue			2
" @entity17 never asked for more than the ' guideline ' amount of spousal support based on mr. @entity3 ' income			1
from the very beginning of the dissolution of marriage matter , @entity17 has worked diligently to get this matter settled and to put it behind her while coping with the distress and trauma suffered as a result of the revelations about mr. @entity3 ' life			1
" @entity25 said in the court documents that she was unaware of @entity3 ' behavior until he told her in january 2012			2
they separated the next month , after almost 27 years of marriage			0
a can of worms tuesday 's revelation opened up a whole can of worms for the actor			0
the gist of it is this : a relative of @entity3 ' first wife went to police in november 2012 and told them she was sexually assaulted by @entity3 when she was 14 years old while inside his @entity97 apartment , a senior law enforcement official told @entity1 on tuesday evening			1
due to the statute of limitations , he ca n't face charges in the case			1
there are specific laws in child sexual abuse cases in @entity97 that do allow for an extension of the statute of limitations in certain cases , but this particular allegation against @entity3 ca n't be prosecuted , the official added			1
now , the investigation continues to see if there might be any other women with similar allegations , the source said			0
in @entity97 , a person has five years from their 18th birthday to make an accusation of sexual abuse to authorities			2
@entity0 police said they received information two years ago regarding allegations of criminal behavior			2
the case is no longer active , @entity127 spokesman @entity126 said			0
" no crime report was ever made and there was no verified victim , " he said			0
bizarre end to tuesday @entity3 is alive and well , the @entity0 police said late tuesday night after rumors circulated on social media that he had shot himself			1
but he was n't even at home when a reporter camped outside heard a loud noise and called police , believing it was a gunshot , said @entity127 spokeswoman @entity140			0
police determined no shots had been fired			0
but the news already had ricocheted around the world , helped in part by numerous tweets , including one by actress @entity146 to her 53,000 followers			0
" that guy from @entity9 lives right around the corner from me & just shot himself a few minutes ago , " she wrote			0
that tweet has since been deleted			0
" i just tweeted out what i was being told by my neighbor ( s ) who were on scene			0
i apologize for tweeting what i 'd heard before confirming it , " she posted instead			0
source : ' @entity9 ' actor 's accuser waited too long the fallout following the revelation of the allegations , @entity3 was fired from his job on the movie " @entity166			1
" a future episode of the @entity170 show " scandal " wo n't include any footage with @entity3 , representatives for the show said wednesday			1
@entity3 appeared as anchorman @entity173 in a 2012 episode of the hit drama and was set to appear in another one this season			2
@entity3 also resigned tuesday from his spot on the national board of the @entity179 , a source at the organization with knowledge of the situation told @entity1			2
and @entity184 , a family - friendly network , said it was pulling reruns of " @entity9 " from its lineup because it was " deeply concerned for the families that are potentially affected by these disturbing allegations			0
" who is @entity3 ? @entity1 's @entity192 reported from @entity0 , @entity193 from @entity97 , and @entity194 wrote from @entity195			1
@entity1 's @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 and @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
