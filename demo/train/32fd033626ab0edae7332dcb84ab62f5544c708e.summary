-- the @entity1 will hold a news conference monday to formally introduce former @entity4 skipper @entity3 , 46 , as the new coach of the men 's national soccer team			1
@entity3 's first match will be a highly anticipated august 10 bout with @entity10 , which thrashed the @entity11 4 - 2 in this year 's @entity13 final			1
he takes over as the team 's 35th manager , replacing @entity16 who had coached the team since january 2007			2
@entity16 was relieved of his duties thursday			0
@entity11 soccer president @entity19 said he was excited to see @entity3 taking over			1
" he is a highly accomplished player and coach with the experience and knowledge to advance the program , " @entity19 said in a statement last week			1
" @entity27 has had success in many different areas of the game and we look forward to the leadership he will provide on and off the field			0
" @entity3 's record as a coach is a mixed bag			1
though he silenced many of his critics by leading @entity39 to a third - place trophy in the 2006 @entity41 , he stepped down to be with his wife , @entity43 , and their two children , who live in @entity45			0
" i have a big wish to return to my family and get back to normality , " he said during a news conference announcing his resignation			0
in 2008 , the @entity52 native took over @entity53 , one of @entity39 's most prestigious club teams , but he was replaced after a year , despite a 25 - 9 - 9 record and making the quarterfinals of @entity59 's @entity58			1
it was widely reported that he did not see eye - to - eye with @entity53 's board of directors			2
it 's worth noting that @entity3 coached @entity11 star @entity64 during a loan to @entity66			1
@entity3 told @entity68 's @entity67 last year that he believes @entity64 " can play at the highest level " and thinks the 29 - year - old midfielder could have excelled in @entity39 's @entity70 had he been given more time			1
@entity3 's resume as a player is far more impressive			1
as a striker , " the @entity82 " always had a knack for finding the back of the net and amassed 232 goals in 516 games during his 17 - year club career			0
during that time , he played for some of the world 's best teams , including @entity87 's @entity86 , @entity89 's @entity88 and @entity53			0
he also played for the @entity4 national team that won the @entity91 and the @entity4 squad that brought home 1996 's @entity93			0
he scored 47 goals in 108 games for his national team			0
@entity3 has been considered for the @entity11 post in the past , but negotiations crumbled twice over the amount of control @entity3 would wield in coaching the top @entity11 squad			1
last year , @entity3 told @entity67 that he passed on the job after the 2006 @entity41 but " left it totally positive			2
" in a separate interview with @entity68 's soccer guru , @entity3 said he turned down the job following the @entity107 because the @entity1 would n't give him full control of the team in writing			1
he declined to explain exactly what the federation refused to include			0
" that goes too much into specifics , " @entity3 told @entity67			2
" i do n't want to go that far			0
we could n't get the deal done because of a couple of issues , and the main issue was we could n't get it into a written format			0
" @entity3 will immediately replace @entity16 , who was signed to a second four - year contract in august			2
he had a 45 - 25 - 12 record but faced criticism for decisions that observers said led to losses in pivotal games			0
included are a 2 - 1 loss to @entity132 in the second round of the @entity107 , and blown 2 - 0 leads in the @entity136 final against @entity137 and the @entity13 final against @entity10 in june .			2

@entity3 was *tapped* a day after @entity11 men 's coach was fired
he has a mixed record as a coach
his first match will be a highly anticipated bout against @entity10
