-- should zombies rise up someday soon and take over the world because of an unidentified plague or virus that 's caused the collapse of modern society as we know it , how would you react ? such is the fundamental question of @entity11 's widely successful show " @entity12 , " which returns this sunday for its second season			1
based on @entity16 's comic book , the series is one of the more odd yet complex dramas on television today			2
at its core , it 's about survival and the psychological stress that spending every waking moment together has on a small group			2
but that could be said about all human beings in that surviving the world is something we do on a daily basis ; the trick with " @entity12 " is that a pack of ravenous zombies could be lurking around the corner , ready to make you into dinner			1
viewers are consistently presented with questions of morality , instinct and terror , where plots are less about discovery -- there 's no race for the cure -- and more about the struggle to exist			2
@entity0 checked in with " @entity12 " showrunner / executive producer @entity50 to see what 's in store for season two , how the show finds its storytelling voice and just how they get that authentic zombie feel			1
@entity0 : on average , how much are you thinking about zombies each day ? @entity50 : all of them			1
i wake up thinking about zombies			1
how do i keep them scary ? what 's new , what 's different , what 's fun that we can do with zombies ? @entity0 : how did this show become so popular on just a six - episode first season ? what 's the appeal ? @entity50 : it 's visceral			1
there 's an immediacy for anyone watching it , where they think , " what would i do ? " people buy into the idea that a plague could wipe out things			2
we 've seen that , and it 's in the zeitgeist now			2
it 's playing on the everyman level where it 's about the survivors and not about what happened to the collapse of government or infrastructure			2
you get in the car , and it runs out of gas , and then what ? meanwhile , you 're being chased by zombies			1
@entity0 : remember the swine flu ? that was a legit panic			2
it 's like when you 're watching a horror movie and the people move into a haunted house			0
and you 're wondering , why did n't think just move out ? everything our survivors are doing , hopefully , strikes people as realistic			0
they 're making decisions that ordinary people would make			0
and none of those decisions have very good consequences			0
@entity0 : there 's also weird psychological dynamics between the characters where they have to get along while also ensuring that they survive , they want to survive , and everyone around them survives too , because as far as they know , they 're it			0
our characters are definitely flawed			0
but they 're stuck together because , hopefully , there 's survival in numbers			0
it 's an interesting dynamic that we 're going to play out all season where people are deciding , are they better off with the group or without ? @entity0 : in a few of the articles that have come out , you mention the desire to showcase your own storytelling voice			1
what would that entail , exactly , for the viewer ? @entity50 : part of what i hope to do this season is really focus on the character of @entity154 and his questions of leadership			1
taking over a successful show , i 'm facing my own questions of leadership , so that 's easy to write			1
but i feel that the work i 've done in the past , especially on " @entity163 , " where it was a very surprising , violent show , yet grounded work -- that 's something i 'm trying to bring to this piece as well			1
because it 's a heightened reality , one where people are being chased by zombies , you have to be careful not to tip that line where it becomes unrealistic			1
you have to be grounded , and that 's something we worked very hard on " @entity163 " to achieve			0
at the same time , it ca n't be bleak			1
it has to be hopeful			0
otherwise , it becomes too depressing			0
the show this year has a lot of heart			1
it is about the moments of personal heartbreak between the characters ; it 's something i 'm excited about and the other writers have bought into			0
it 's something we see as an important part of the season			1
@entity0 : for viewers , there 's always this idea that a " walker " could appear and eat your face			0
how do you develop characters that are more than just " scared " but also still keep the viewer psychologically afraid ? @entity50 : our characters do deal with it in different ways			1
some do lose hope ; some have a sense of humor ; some rise to the challenge ; some develop in a way that they could n't in the pre-apocalyptic world			0
for example , @entity216 or @entity217 , when she comes into her own this season			1
they have new roles or opportunities available to them before the zombies took over			1
we 're trying to explore it in a lot of different ways , where it 's individual to each character			0
@entity0 : back to the zombies : are there certain guidelines the actors have to follow to get that " authentic zombie feel " ? @entity50 : @entity233 is our zombie king			1
he actually runs a zombie school , where he brings in extras and actors , where he teaches them all about zombies			1
depending on how they do , he positions them in the shot			0
the better zombies get more makeup and are more up - front			2
those zombies who are not as scary , they 're more in the back of the shots or the edge of the frames			2
what 's great about @entity233 is when the writers have questions like " would a zombie do this ? " and we call @entity233 and talk through a lot of zombie science and zombie law			0
he 's our resident expert			0
@entity0 : obviously they 're hideous , but they all have a different lurch			0
@entity50 : yeah , i think that 's how @entity233 is working with them			1
he spends a lot of time making sure each zombie can be featured			2
also , if you think about it , every zombie is an individual who died			0
you want to make them individual			0
@entity0 : as the show evolves over season two , what are some of the larger thematic issues you see playing out ? @entity50 : @entity154 's dilemma of trying to lead his group to a save haven and the romantic triangle between @entity282 , @entity283 and @entity154			1
that really complicates life as everyone wrestles with what they know , what they think they know and what they do n't know			0
and a question we want to handle is , what is life like for the children in this world ? do they represent hope , or are they just fodder for the zombies ? that 's the question : how much hope is there ? we have a lot of themes we 're juggling every episode			2
@entity0 : you take out the phrase " post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland , " and much of it could be applied to what 's going on today			0
@entity50 : that 's the whole trick			1
that 's something that sometimes our character 's step back from the horror , and they realize that			0
has there been any guarantee of hope and survival ? has it all been just an illusion ? is this the real world , where we 're just in the doorway between life and death ? it 's interesting , and this is what we want to see our characters wrestle with			0
our show revolves around character ; it does n't rely on revelation			2
no one knows why the zombies took over , but it 's not about finding the cure			2
it 's about staying alive and figuring out what to do			0
