-- holiday gatherings can be rough			1
you have a sneaking suspicion @entity3 is going to have a drink or five too many , and you 're still wincing about that great gift your brother 's girlfriend gave you last year , when you did n't get her a thing			1
you probably know how to handle these situations with grace and poise			0
but how would you really like to do it ? comedian @entity13 is here to provide a little inspiration			1
we asked @entity13 -- a former " @entity22 " correspondent who also appears in @entity17 's " @entity16 " and films including " @entity19 " -- to suggest some mischief for those awkward holiday moments			1
and for those without the comedic chops to follow his lead , we 've also sought expert advice from stress management consultant @entity28 , founder and ceo of @entity32 , and @entity33 , a licensed psychologist in the @entity36 , @entity35 , area and contributor to the @entity39 blog " @entity40			1
" scenario 1 : someone gives you a gift , but you did n't get him / her one @entity13 's take : thank goodness for current events			1
" this is a good year for that , " @entity13 says			1
" if that happens this year , you pat down your pockets , or pull them out and show that they are empty , and you say , ' aw , man , i 'm so sorry -- the recession and all			0
' " and that 's it , you 're off the hook			2
and you 're one up on presents			0
" expert advice : smile graciously , say thank you , do n't feel guilty , and do n't decide on the spot that you 're going to give something in return , @entity33 and @entity28 say			1
gift - giving does n't always need to be reciprocal			0
" [ being thankful ] is more important than stammering , ' i forgot your gift and i 'll bring it tomorrow , ' " @entity33 says			1
scenario 2 : a relative bugs you with personal questions @entity13 's take : is the spotlight on you after @entity69 asked about your unemployment ? use it			1
" if you can deliver it with a straight face , tell them you 're thinking about becoming a rapper , " @entity13 says			1
" that will get them off your back			0
" give them a little demo of the rapping skills			2
that 's always nice , have a little rap in your pocket			2
but you have to commit to it , like , ' my name is @entity13 , and i like corn on the cob ' -- something that 's awful , but make them believe you 're sincere about it			1
" that usually will work on at least getting them to talk to each other instead of you			0
" and if you 're interrogated about your nonexistent dating life ? " i think being a little obnoxious at the top would signal you 're not appreciating the conversation , " @entity13 says			1
" if they ask when you are getting married , say , ' tomorrow			0
' that 's letting them know , ' ok , he 's not going to answer me seriously , ' and they 'll be off your back			2
" expert advice : come up with canned responses now -- ones that answer the question sufficiently but put a period on the topic			2
" somebody that has been out of work a long time probably does n't want to talk about being unemployed , " @entity33 says			1
" you may say something like , ' thanks so much for asking			0
i 've had a lot of interesting conversations with a lot of people about a lot of jobs , and i 'm looking forward to 2010			0
' " that leads to the next topic			0
you can say , ' speaking of 2010 , what are you doing for @entity127 's ? ' " scenario 3 : you arrive with a new significant other , but your friends and relatives are loyal to the previous one @entity13 's take : " you have to sell how happy you are , " he says			1
" this is where it falls on you to be your absolute best			0
you really have to sell your joy and love for the world			0
you 're leading the carols			0
then they 'll have to say , ' wow , you 're really happy			0
your joy can not be denied			0
' " and what will the new date think ? " the new partner will love it , " @entity13 says			1
" she wo n't know why you 're happy			0
she 'll think , ' hey , this guy loves family			0
maybe i 'll want to marry him			0
' it just works all the way around			0
" expert advice : the best defense is a great offense			2
walk straight up to people and confidently introduce him or her			0
" that can take people who thought they had the upper hand off guard , because you 're showing confidence , " says @entity28 , the @entity32 founder			1
in case someone gives you a weird look , have an escape plan			0
" say [ to your date ] , ' you wanted a drink , right ? let 's get one			2
' or , ' look over there , there 's @entity172			2
i wanted you to meet him , too , ' " @entity28 says			1
scenario 4 : a relative is drunk and becoming obnoxious @entity13 's take : now might be the time to put the fun in dysfunction			1
" generally speaking , when people drink , it 's bad - decision time			2
that can be a lot of fun , " @entity13 says			1
" that 's an opportunity to talk them into doing something stupid , like getting them to take off their shirt or wrestle in the living room			2
" " also , alcohol serves as a truth serum , so that 's the time to ask those tough questions			2
get that family gossip out there , like the time cousin @entity196 pooped his pants or something along those lines			0
" these opportunities only come around so often -- weddings and holidays , that 's it			2
milk them for all you can get			0
that 's the time to get the family dish			0
" expert advice : @entity28 and @entity33 say it 's generally best not to engage the heavy drinker , lest you risk an ugly scene			1
@entity28 , though , adds that someone with a good relationship with the person may want to kindly ask him or her to tone it down			1
" do n't shame them in front of others -- take them into the next room and talk to them , " @entity28 says			1
@entity33 says visitors can prepare an exit strategy : " talk with your partner or kids and say , ' if @entity230 starts screaming , that 's our cue to go home			1
