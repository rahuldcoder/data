what if the world 's most distinguished human rights organization decided to condone pimping ? unthinkable , right ? but that 's what happened when @entity5 put forth a document calling for the legalization of prostitution			1
for 50 years , the global women 's movement has been fighting the selling and buying of human beings , which has a name : slavery			1
for decades , feminists called for criminalizing the buyers while decriminalizing the women they buy ; offering women support services ranging from safe harbor through drug rehabilitation to education and skills training ; and enforcing laws that criminalize pimps , traffickers and brothel owners			1
the response was that it would never work ( and feminists were crazy , sex - hating @entity29 )			0
the sex industry fought back , both openly -- it 's the " oldest profession , always been with us " ; it represents " sexual liberation " -- and covertly , through funding happy - hooker - type groups , rebranding prostitution as " sex work , " and praising it as a career choice indistinguishable from any other			2
have you ever met an 8 - year - old who said , " ooh , i wan na grow up to be a hooker " ? the numbers of prostituted women who suffer post-traumatic stress disorder are in the same range as combat veterans and refugees from state sponsored torture			1
they are also disproportionately survivors of child sexual and physical abuse , rape and battery , kidnapping , assault with a deadly weapon , and addiction to drugs and / or alcohol			1
@entity62 , a survivor activist , has noted that every prostituted woman has been forced , whether or not she seems to " choose willingly			2
" racism , violence and poverty are ever present forms of coercion in the sex industry ; consequently , poor women and women of color have a disproportionately large presence			2
and we 're only now discovering the enormous impact of prostitution on women in native communities			1
as the survivors succinctly depict it : $ does not = @entity81			2
there is , as @entity83 pointed out in her classic , " the @entity85 , " a single interrelated mega-enterprise of sexual exploitation			0
we know the trajectory of , say , a young runaway from an abusive home : @entity91 , the offer of work in " films			0
" then , the " temporary " turning of a trick or two , which becomes a permanent deployment in prostitution			0
finally , she finds herself being moved around as a trafficked commodity			0
despite this reality , the phrase " sex work " became fashionable among some well - meaning people who assumed that this term meant respect for the women involved -- when actually it signifies approval for the context in which such women were trying to stay barely alive , or from which they were trying to escape			0
nevertheless , progress seemed possible			0
@entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115 passed legislation holding customers responsible for buying human beings for sex , criminalizing the buyers and offering the women support programs			1
this is known as the @entity124			0
the @entity126 parliament voted last december to follow @entity113 's model ; similar laws are pending in the parliaments of @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 , and the @entity134 favored it with a strongly affirmative vote on february 24 , 2014			0
see , the model works			0
since @entity113 began enforcement , street prostitution has been reduced almost by half and trafficking has declined			0
this unglues the arguments of those who treat trafficking as a separate issue from " sex work			0
" is it less enslaving to be bought in your own country rather than another ? contrarily , countries with legalized prostitution have greater inflows of human trafficking , according to a study published in @entity156			1
then , just when it seemed sanity was winning , the respected human rights organization @entity5 appears to have come out on the side of the sex industry			1
an @entity5 document , " @entity163 , " argues that pimps and johns should be " free from government interference " and allowed to " exercise their autonomy			1
" it says governments have an obligation to establish an environment where pimps can operate freely to engage prostituted people ; to do otherwise " threatens the rights to health , nondiscrimination , equality , privacy , and security of persons			0
" the document also insults the disability community by claiming that men with disabilities require access to prostituted women to further their sense of " life enjoyment and dignity			1
" @entity5 has argued that the document is a draft and is in the discussion stage			1
but @entity5 representatives appeared at the @entity195 in january , lobbying to strike down proposed legislation that would criminalize customers for buying prostituted women			1
what 's even more stunning is that a former member of @entity5 , is proudly claiming credit for having first raised the issue of legalizing pimps and brothel owners at the organization , which he says resulted in the policy recommendation			2
a campaigner for the @entity208 who and calls himself a " sex worker " , he and his partner run a major escort service			0
@entity5 , however , denies his involvement in the draft document , saying he had " zero input			1
" @entity5 came to this on its own , then ? hard to know which is worse			2
it took decades for the global women 's movement to convince @entity5 that human rights were not reserved for male people			1
now , @entity222 has set things back by considering a shocking violation of the @entity225			0
but this time , the " crazy , puritanical feminists " ca n't be dismissed ; we 're backed by national governments who 've proved our point â€” and saved women 's lives			0
this time survivors must be heard			0
on march 8 , a mass protest will be held at @entity5 's @entity236 headquarters , and a worldwide virtual protest is building online			2
a global petition to @entity5 and a facebook page called @entity240 of @entity5 has full information			2
we hope @entity5 will regain its soul -- and realize that survivors ' rights are women 's rights are human rights .			1

@entity5 put forth a document calling for the legalization of prostitution
