the @entity0 said thursday that it had pulled its largest naval vessel away from a remote lagoon in the @entity3 where it was engaged in an uneasy standoff with two @entity7 maritime surveillance ships			1
but the tense situation is not yet resolved , as a @entity0 coast guard boat remains at the scene , and a third @entity7 ship has arrived , said @entity12 , a spokesman for the @entity0 @entity13			1
the @entity0 naval vessel -- the @entity15 , a 378 - foot cutter -- has moved away from the lagoon for " reprovisioning " and a decision has not yet been announced on whether it will return , @entity12 said			1
he said negotiations were continuing with the @entity7 in the hope of finding a " diplomatic solution " to the impasse at @entity24 , which both countries claim is " an integral part " of their territory			1
@entity24 is about 200 kilometers west of the @entity0 mainland			0
" for now , the ball is on the side of the @entity7 , " @entity12 said			0
the @entity0 sent the @entity15 to the area of @entity24 on sunday after surveillance aircraft spotted eight @entity7 fishing boats anchored inside the lagoon			1
a boarding team from the @entity15 went to inspect the @entity7 fishing boats tuesday morning and found " large amounts of illegally collected corals , giant clams and live sharks " inside one of the boats , according to the @entity0 government			2
later tuesday , the @entity15 reported that the two @entity7 surveillance ships had arrived and taken up a position at the mouth of the lagoon , blocking the way to the fishing boats and " preventing the arrest " of the fishermen			2
the @entity0 said thursday that it had sent the coast guard vessel to support the @entity15			1
it also reported the arrival of the third @entity7 vessel , which it said was from @entity7 's @entity57			0
the @entity59 in @entity60 has complained to the @entity0 authorities about " the harassment of @entity7 fishermen , " @entity7 's official news agency , @entity58 , reported wednesday			1
@entity7 has " urged the @entity0 side to stop immediately their illegal activities and leave the area , " @entity58 reported , saying that the fishermen were taking shelter in the lagoon " due to harsh weather conditions			2
" the embassy is " engaged in discussions with the @entity0 @entity13 to seek a solution " and maintain peace and stability in the @entity3 , @entity58 said			2
the @entity3 -- a 1.3 million square mile patch of the @entity76 bracketed by @entity7 and several @entity78 nations -- is dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls that are home to some of the world 's most diverse marine life			0
also under its waves lie potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil			0
that prospect has peppered the sea with competing claims from @entity7 , @entity93 , the @entity0 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			0
it has also resulted in frequent small - scale clashes			0
last year , a spate of incidents took place between @entity7 and @entity93 vessels .			0
