-- a very nice married couple from @entity2 struck up a conversation in a restaurant where we were having dinner			2
at one point the husband said that , earlier in his life , he had played with some buddies in a rock band			2
the name of the band , he said , was the @entity14			2
" like the jukebox , " i said			2
" of course , " he said			2
@entity19 jukeboxes were gorgeous ; they were icons of the early days of rock and roll			1
" where do you think those jukeboxes got their name ? " i asked him			1
he assumed the same thing most people always assumed : " @entity19 " was a combination of " rock and roll " and " @entity31 , " the storied brand of early phonograph - record players			1
" nope , " i said			2
i had always thought the same thing			2
but then , years ago , i spoke with the founder of @entity19			1
the whole thing was a total coincidence			2
even before he started manufacturing jukeboxes , he had put the hyphen between the two parts of his name when he was selling coin - operated machines			1
he just wanted customers to be able to pronounce his name -- and the company 's -- correctly			2
the couple to whom i told the story laughed , and later it occurred to me that many products we take for granted -- products so famous that they and their names are synonymous -- once started out nameless			1
there was the thing -- the product -- and then there was a need to call it something			2
take @entity58 , the candy bar			1
when you hear " snickers , " you immediately see the candy , almost taste it			1
but how did it become snickers ? well , the @entity66 family , who introduced the candy bar , had a favorite horse they owned			1
so when they needed to call the candy bar something ... cheerios -- the cereal ? it was originally named @entity73 , because of its main ingredient			1
but there was a problem -- a competitor was producing an oat cereal with a similar name			2
it has n't done badly			1
how about q - tips ? everyone knows what they are , but what does the name mean ? a man named @entity90 , in the 1920s , saw his wife applying cotton swabs to toothpicks			1
this gave him the idea to come up with a pre-made cotton swab for use with infants			0
the product 's original name -- intended to connote gentle care of happy newborns ( this was in a different @entity106 era , with a different lexicon ) -- was @entity108			0
but that did n't adequately describe the product , so it was changed to q - tips			1
q for quality ; tips for the cotton swab at either end			0
what about @entity117 , the late singer ? ( i know we 're getting a little far afield here -- @entity121 was a person , not a product -- but he was terrific , and his name begs the question			1
) he was @entity117 in the 1950s , trying to make it big in the recording industry , and finding that " @entity117 " did n't exactly translate to thrills and excitement			1
so the story went , he and his manager took a map of the @entity106 and put their fingers on it			1
on @entity136 and @entity137 , to be precise			0
soon his records were enormous hits in @entity19 jukeboxes from coast to coast			1
next up : @entity144 , the classic penny loafers made by the @entity147 shoe company			0
you know those shoes on sight			0
but the name ? it refers to a similar kind of shoe that was worn by @entity156 farmers			0
@entity156 : @entity144 , for short			0
you still along for the ride ? let 's pull over to the @entity160			0
one of the most recognizable brands on the planet			0
when @entity164 first came up with the idea for standardized , affordable highway motels , he did n't have a name for it			1
his architect , @entity169 , as an in - joke , wrote , across the bottom of his diagrams , " @entity160 , " after the @entity171 movie about a country lodge			0
@entity164 liked the sound , which turned out to be a spectacular business decision			0
@entity179 ? a made - up combination of make - believe words to make a brand of ice cream sound @entity184 and inviting			0
the words mean nothing at all			0
@entity189 , on the other hand , started out as @entity190 , named for their inventor , @entity189			1
when he applied for a patent , the product was officially titled the @entity197 ice pop. his children , though , called this confection dreamed up by their dad -- their pop -- a @entity189			0
@entity204 ? in @entity208 after @entity207 , a fellow named @entity206 decided to sell hamburgers from a stand			1
he called his store @entity211			0
he had some competitors nearby : a couple of brothers with their own stand			0
the brothers had a splendid hamburger product			0
@entity206 arrived at the conclusion that , when it came to burgers , he probably could not outcook and outsell @entity217 's			0
so he chose another food specialty : tacos			0
he tried a few names before settling on a variation of @entity211 , altered to connote @entity227 cuisine : @entity204			1
space is growing short here , and there 's probably an outside chance that somewhere in the world today there is more important news than this			0
quickly : @entity237 soda pop. the founder wanted customers to understand that his soda pop came in tall bottles , offering good value for the money			1
knee - high bottles , to be hyperbolic			0
in marketing , hyperbolic is good			2
may we slip just one more in ? @entity248			0
its founder , @entity249 , liked to proudly proclaim to all who would listen that the cow was " the queen of the dairy business			0
" as a parting note , let 's give the last word to @entity19 himself			1
he died in 1993 ; when i spoke with him , six years earlier , he was 90			0
i told him that it must be really cool to be able to have a jukebox in his home -- especially one with his name on it			0
no jukebox in the @entity19 home : " i had speakers installed in the ceilings of every room , and i had the wiring put in			1
but at the last minute , mrs. @entity19 said no. she said , ' you get enough of jukeboxes at the factory			1
we do n't need one here			2
' " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			1

@entity280 learned the story behind @entity19 jukeboxes ' name ; got *curious* about others
he found @entity58 candy was named after a favorite horse of the @entity66 family
he learned how @entity117 picked a new name because the real one was n't as exciting
@entity280 : first there are products , then they need names ; and behind them some good stories
