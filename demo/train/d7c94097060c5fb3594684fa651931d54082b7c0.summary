-- just what we need out of @entity3 : more wind			2
but seriously , folks -- the @entity5 took time out tuesday to plug what it called a success story ahead of president @entity9 's @entity11 address			1
citing a new report by the @entity14 , @entity9 spokesman @entity12 said the administration 's much - criticized economic stimulus bill turned what had been a projected decline in new wind electricity generation in 2009 to a sharp increase			1
@entity12 said the association predicted the amount of new electricity produced by wind turbines would dip by 50 percent in 2009 , compared to the capacity added in 2008			1
" instead , this tax credit came through the @entity27 , and we saw a 39 percent increase in the number of wind plants , wind power , generated over the course of last year , " @entity12 said			2
@entity12 pointed to the administration 's assistance to the renewable energy industry as an example of " investments for the future			2
" did @entity12 correctly characterize the report 's findings ? yes			2
but while the industry credits the stimulus bill with spurring new growth in 2009 , it says the new growth has n't necessarily translated into new jobs			1
the industry did add nearly 10,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 2009 , " shattering any expectations we had for the year , given the financial crisis , " said @entity50 , the @entity14 's director of industry data and analysis			0
utilities had a strong first quarter of the year based on projects that were already in the works before the financial meltdown of 2008			0
but projects dried up quickly in mid-year , before about $ 1.9 billion in renewable energy tax credits from the stimulus bill began to kick in , @entity50 said			0
once the rules for qualifying for those credits were drafted , companies began using them to raise private capital and the year finished " significantly stronger " than expected , she said			0
" that really is due to the @entity27			0
" wind power produced about 1.6 percent of the electricity used in the @entity72 though october 2009 , according to @entity72 @entity74 figures			1
that 's up from about 1.25 percent in all of 2008 , and the final figure for 2009 is likely to be close to 2 percent , @entity50 said			0
but while the wind projects produced new jobs for people installing and maintaining the new generating units , the stimulus funding " does n't necessarily translate to increases in manufacturing , " @entity50 said			1
" overall , we 've had some gains and some losses , " she said			1
" i think we 've been able to remain steady at about 85,000 jobs , which is about where we ended up at the end of 2008			1
" @entity50 said the industry will be closely watching @entity9 's budget proposal , expected next week , for signs of continued support			0
" manufacturing needs a much longer time horizon to make investments , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity96 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 spokesman says stimulus increased new wind electricity generation
report shows , however , the new growth has n't necessarily translated into new jobs
industry analyst : " overall , we 've had some gains and some losses "
