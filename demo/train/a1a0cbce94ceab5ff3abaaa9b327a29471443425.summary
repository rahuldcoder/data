-- forget the @entity1 -- @entity2 has a new pair of mythical beasts to lure curious tourists to its shores			1
standing proudly 25 miles from @entity7 , " the @entity12 " are the world 's largest equine sculptures , and it is hoped they 'll become just as famous as old " @entity1			1
" the name , rooted in @entity15 folklore , refers to a supernatural water horse that was said to stalk the rivers and lochs of @entity2			1
despite that fertile source of inspiration , sculptor @entity19 opted to shun the esoteric to stay rooted in reality , creating a piece that performs a dual role -- as a monument to industry and a beacon of regeneration			1
" rather than go along the line of the mythical sea horses and all that wifty wafty @entity2 stuff , i erred much more towards the heritage of workhorses and our industrial and agricultural past , " he told @entity0			1
" the horses would have drawn the barges along the canals originally , so there was a great relevance with central @entity2 and the @entity42 area			1
" they really are quite imposing , it 's a flat estuary down there and they really have a presence on the landscape and work very well against the hills			2
" that sense of scale was really important to me and i 've been justified in my intent there			0
" standing 30 meters tall and utilizing six kilometers of steel , " the @entity12 " were seven years and $ 8 million in the making			1
they are part of a wider $ 70 million project to transform 350 hectares of land in the @entity59 , equidistant between @entity7 and @entity60 , in the hope that up to 350,000 tourists will visit each year			1
billed under a project called " @entity64 , " the sculptures underline the impact that art on a grand scale can have in transforming an area			1
" i can only hope that is what happens and they do act as a catalyst for a sense of pride and regeneration , to draw people to the area , " @entity19 said			2
" it would be churlish to ignore the impact of ' the @entity80 ' ( by @entity81 ) , and one of my personal favorites , @entity83 's ' @entity82 in @entity86			2
' " i 've been over there a few times to have a look at how it 's been instrumental in regenerating that area of @entity91 in @entity86			2
these things can have that effect			0
" so what is it about these great set - pieces that strike such a chord with the public ? " partially , it is the scale -- the sheer monumental nature of them draws people to them , " @entity19 explained			2
" media awareness , social media , word of mouth spreads the word , it spins out the attraction as it were , gives it that ' must see ' status			0
" already the story of ' @entity12 ' has gone round the world and that really sets them on people 's agenda and makes people want to come and see them for themselves			1
" i think another thing these large pieces do is that they change as an artwork and your perception of them from a distance , when you might see them as horses on the landscape but then the closer you get they become much more of an architectural feature			0
" i was determined from the beginning that the public should be allowed inside them , to actually see the engineering and the scale from the inside			0
" they are recognizable objects and that immediately throws out a line of engagement with the audience that perhaps some other abstract pieces do n't			0
" i think the figuratively , recognizable nature of the horses seems to be drawing a fair amount of comment			0
" the two sculptures were modeled on actual @entity150 horses called @entity151 and @entity152 , and @entity19 made two small - scale maquettes standing three meters high			1
the 18,000 components that made up each @entity155 were then forged in @entity156 before they were painstakingly assembled on - site over the course of six months			0
not only is the scale so striking but the dynamic between the two horses captivates too -- one looking down , the other rearing up			0
" what i wanted to do was create some sense of dramatic tension between the two , " @entity19 said			2
" i mulled over different options of poses but i reckon that dynamic tension creates a bit of a narrative , and the viewers can make up their own stories and engage with them			0
" it would have been arguably much simpler to make a mirror image of each on either side of the canal , but that certainly creates that more dramatic sight line			0
" you always catch a glimpse of the other one from the other side			0

the @entity12 in central @entity2 are the world 's largest pair of equine sculptures
at a total cost of $ 8 million , each horse towers 30 meters above the ground
the work of sculptor @entity19 , they pay *tribute* to @entity2 's industrial heritage
*kelpies* are part of a wider project to regenerate the area at a cost of $ 70 million
