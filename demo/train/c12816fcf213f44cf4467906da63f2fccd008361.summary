-- summertime has long been associated with pool parties and barbecues			0
but with so many new programs and series ' finales on the way , the tv remote could be just as crucial this season as sunscreen and hot dogs			2
it used to be that reruns and reality tv shows were the stars of summer tv			2
and while reality staples such as " @entity19 " and " @entity20 " still stand , they 're now offset by a slew of original dramas and comedies , some of which boast a star power that 's relatively new to the summer season			1
this shift has been in the works for a while , since innovative cable shows began forcing networks to up the ante about six years ago , said @entity34 , features editor at @entity36			2
" this is the most highly anticipated summer in tv history , " he said , adding that the lineup " seems more exciting than the fall tv lineup			2
" @entity42 's new series " @entity43 " will take viewers behind the scenes of a fictional cable news network when it premieres on june 24			1
it 's one of the most buzzed - about new dramas , thanks in part to series creator @entity51			2
the oscar - winner is known for helming the emmy - winning drama " @entity54 , " which aired for seven seasons on @entity56			0
starring @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , the series " has award winner written all over it already , " @entity34 said			0
@entity42 is owned by @entity0 's parent company			1
" @entity66 " has been a summer staple since season 2 kicked off in june 2009 on @entity42			1
returning on sunday , season 5 boasts a new draw -- " @entity69 : @entity71 " veteran @entity70 has joined the cast as a vampire			2
three - time @entity75 - nominated actress @entity74 will also grace the tube this summer on @entity78 's " political animals			1
" she 'll play divorced , former first lady @entity79 , who now serves as the secretary of state			0
joining @entity74 are @entity81 and @entity82 , among other notable stars			1
the series is set to premiere in july			2
the @entity74 series is hardly @entity78 's only lure this summer			1
" @entity87 , " " @entity88 , " " @entity89 " and " suits " will all be back			0
highly anticipated final seasons beginning this summer include @entity93 's " @entity92 " and @entity95 's " the closer , " which will air additional episodes to prepare for a potential spinoff			1
meanwhile , come july 11 , @entity98 will take " @entity100 " into its final season			1
perhaps the summer season 's greatest star power can be found on fx			1
@entity105 's " @entity104 " will debut on june 28			1
@entity106 and @entity107 will also appear on the show , which features @entity105 as an anger management therapist			0
" there 's no way that 's not going to have huge ratings , " said @entity34 , who added that " @entity111 's " ratings have n't been so hot since @entity112 took over			0
" people want @entity105 , " @entity34 continued			0
" they 're going to tune in for @entity105			0
( ' @entity104 ' ) could very well deliver @entity103 's highest rating of all time			0
" @entity103 also has a notable name behind its new series , " @entity121			0
" the comedian will star in the late - night series , sharing his take on everything from politics to pop culture			0
it 's not as easy as it used to be for tv shows to breakout during the summer , said @entity130 , a senior writer and tv critic at @entity132			1
" ( tv ) is not as uncluttered over the summer anymore , but it 's still easier than launching a show the way the big networks do in the fall -- where 80 % of their new shows debut within the same couple of weeks in september			1
" and though summer is no longer a " the world 's wildest police chases and silly garbage , " @entity34 said , programs such as " @entity19 " and " @entity142 , " which he calls " comfort food tv , " are n't going anywhere			1
joining the reality competition genre are dating shows such as @entity151 's " @entity150 " and " @entity152 , " which will premiere on thursday			0
@entity56 's " @entity155 " kicked off its second season on tuesday			1
and on the cable front of reality tv , @entity156 will launch " @entity159 and @entity160			0
" if only because people are curious to observe a pregnant @entity159 , the new reality series is sure to attract viewers , @entity34 said			0
" there truly is something for everybody this year			0
