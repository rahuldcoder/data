-- @entity1 wo n't defend its ban against same - sex marriage , saying its legal position has been " undermined " in a series of rulings that began last june with a historic @entity9 @entity8 ruling recognizing gay marriages			1
the state 's decision comes in a case filed by eight same - sex couples represented by the gay rights group @entity15			1
the case challenged @entity1 's constitutional amendment banning marriage for gay and lesbian couples , the group said			2
a federal court judge dismissed the suit in 2012 at gov. @entity24 's request , but @entity15 appealed that ruling to the federal @entity25			0
since then , the @entity9 @entity8 struck down a key part of the federal @entity27 that had denied to legally married same - sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses			0
a subsequent 9th @entity33 ruling in an unrelated case persuaded @entity1 to abandon its defense of the gay marriage ban , @entity1 officials said			2
that recent case involved a preemptory challenge to strike a prospective juror in a trial because he was gay , but the @entity25 ruled that discriminatory classifications based on sexual orientation must receive heightened scrutiny and should be presumed unconstitutional , @entity15 said			0
" after thoughtful review and analysis , the state has determined that its arguments grounded upon equal protection and due process are no longer sustainable , " @entity1 attorney general @entity44 said in a statement monday			1
gov. @entity24 agreed with the attorney general 's decision to drop its defense of the gay marriage ban			1
" based upon the advice of the attorney general 's office and their interpretation of relevant case law , it has become clear that this case is no longer defensible in court , " @entity57 - @entity56 , a spokeswoman for the governor , said tuesday			1
a @entity15 attorney praised the governor 's decision			2
" the governor has recognized that the writing is on the wall , and that arguments seeking to perpetuate discrimination are becoming extremely difficult to justify , " @entity15 senior attorney @entity69 said in a statement			0
" denying marriage to same - sex couples serves no legitimate state interest and is intended solely to perpetuate discrimination			0
" the state 's withdrawal leaves only the @entity82 for the @entity83 , which a lower court allowed to intervene , defending the marriage ban in federal appeals court , @entity15 said			1
the coalition was n't immediately available for comment tuesday			0
@entity9 expands legal benefits , services for same - sex marriages @entity0 's @entity92 contributed to this report .			0
