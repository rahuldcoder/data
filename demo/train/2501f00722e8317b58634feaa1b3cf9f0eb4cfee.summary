" @entity0 is going to walk on the moon on monday , july 21st			2
" i could n't have envisaged that 45 years after writing that sentence during an infant school exercise i would still be writing about human exploration of the moon -- or lack of it			2
throughout the 1970s , children 's magazines showed artists ' conceptions of the moon bases that would be built			1
but following the global excitement of @entity0 's step off the @entity17 spacecraft 's ladder in july 1969 only 11 more astronauts have walked on the lunar surface and people have not been back since 1972			1
the moon bases have not materialized and supersonic flights for commercial passengers , that looked like they would become commonplace after test flights during the @entity25 era , came and then stopped			1
in the 1960s it was possible to see 3d movies just as it is today			0
in 1969 the @entity29 were still together -- just about , " @entity32 " won an @entity30 for best picture , and @entity34 's " @entity33 " was published			2
they are all still firm favorites			0
so have our advances been with such small steps in the intervening years or have we made giant leaps elsewhere ? the 1960s might seem familiar but the world was actually very different			2
there was no @entity43 , no cell phones -- at least not the kind that fit in your pocket -- crude oil was a fraction of today 's price and the @entity51 still existed			2
the technology of today would have seemed like science fiction to a child of the 1960s			0
the @entity25 spacecraft that took @entity0 , @entity57 and @entity58 to the moon was equipped with a navigation computer that is puny in comparison to today 's devices			2
@entity63 says the @entity25 computers had a permanent memory of about 36,000 words and an erasable memory of about 2,000 words			2
your smartphone likely has a 32 gigabyte storage facility -- theoretically capable of storing about six billion words and it is a lot more versatile than the hardware on the moon capsules			0
you can make a video call to a person on the other side of the world , find out your exact position on the @entity81 to an accuracy of a few meters thanks to satellite navigation , shoot video and share it almost instantaneously , and all from a device that fits in the palm of your hand			0
over the last few decades scientists have become more successful in treating cancers , identified individual genes that cause disease and created bionic limbs for disabled patients			0
so why have n't we been back to the moon ? @entity63 points out that the moon has not been ignored			1
" in the 45 years since the @entity25 , @entity63 has continued scientific study of the moon through robotic explorers , " said a @entity63 spokesman			1
" contemporary missions like @entity63 's grail , @entity101 , and the @entity102 have helped us explore the upper atmosphere , surface , and interior of our nearest neighbor in the solar system			1
" at the same time , @entity63 's fleet of robotic explorers are extending our senses throughout the solar system , as we seek answers to fundamental questions like ' are we alone ? how did life begin on @entity81 ? can we live on other worlds ? ' " he said			1
perhaps then , a better question should be : does it really matter that we have n't returned to the moon in person ? major advances amazing discoveries have also been made in space since the 1960s			1
hundreds of new worlds have been found outside our solar system since the existence of the first exoplanet was confirmed in the 1990s			0
this year , @entity63 announced for the first time that an @entity81 - sized planet that could be habitable had been found 490 light years from us			1
astronomers estimate there are tens of billions of similar , possibly habitable planets in our own galaxy			0
closer to home , a fleet of @entity63 rovers has explored the surface of @entity137 sending back amazing panoramas and drilling into the rocks to test their composition			1
and it 's not just @entity63			1
@entity144 's first @entity137 orbiter is on its way to the @entity137 and private companies are also proposing adventures there			2
probes have been sent on a grand tour of the solar system since the @entity25 -- @entity152 launched in 1977 is now in interstellar space -- and other spacecraft have studied @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			0
we may not have a moon base yet but nations have come together since @entity25 to build the @entity162			0
covering an area the size of a football field , it has been in continuous occupation since 2000 and carries cameras that give high definition video pictures of our home planet			0
our view of the universe has also changed considerably since 1969 , partly due to the wealth of images captured by the @entity176 space telescope that was launched in 1990			0
last year it was announced that @entity176 had discovered an exoplanet with a deep blue color and where it possibly rains liquid glass			0
the @entity182 ( @entity182 ) this year launched the billion pixel @entity184 space telescope with the task of building a 3d map of the @entity188			0
a successor to @entity176 -- the @entity190 -- is currently being built and scheduled for launch in 2018			0
exciting missions are also under way			0
the @entity195 spacecraft is due to orbit a comet beginning in august 2014 and then land a probe on its surface as it races around the @entity201 other nations are planning to reach out to the moon , @entity137 and @entity156 while entrepreneurs are aiming to launch commercial space flights			1
@entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 are all competing to enable access to space			0
where next ? so is it all over for moon exploration ? @entity63 says not though its focus is on sending astronauts to @entity137 in the 2030s			1
" as international partners and the growing @entity220 commercial space industry venture beyond low - earth orbit as well , there may be some opportunities to return humans and robots to the lunar surface			1
our roadmap for exploration includes the possibility of assisting partners with that kind of exploration , but our investments in human spaceflight are focused on enabling the path to @entity137 , " a @entity63 spokesman told @entity227			1
" we 'll soon return humans to the vicinity of the moon ... [ a ] proving ground we need to test these key capabilities and help us advance on the human path to @entity137 , " he said			1
looking up at mesmerizing stars interactive : explore @entity137			2

children 's magazines of the 1970s imagined moon bases that were expected to be built
only *12* people have walked on the lunar surface and none since 1972
@entity63 says it is focused on sending humans to @entity137 in the 2030s
there have been huge technological leaps and space discoveries in the last *40* years
