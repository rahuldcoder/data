@entity0 -- some people collect stamps or build miniature boats , while others obsess over their tricked - out cars -- but what if your hobby was building a nuclear fusion reactor ? for @entity12 , it is			1
by day , @entity13 is a freelance web developer at @entity15 , but at night he works in a warehouse lab in @entity18 , @entity0 , experimenting with nuclear fusion			1
@entity12 says he became hooked on fusion after watching a video featuring @entity22 , an @entity23 physicist who worked primarily in nuclear fusion energy research			1
" it very quickly struck me as one of the better ideas for new forms of energy , " @entity12 says			1
@entity30 , founder of @entity31 , says people typically think of @entity33 or the @entity34 when they hear the word nuclear			2
" and when they hear it they should think sun , " he says , " because what they are building is a miniature synthetic star			2
a fusion reaction is a star			2
" according to @entity46 , director of the @entity47 at @entity48 , nuclear fusion occurs when two hydrogen atoms fuse together and create a helium atom			1
the resulting helium atom has less mass but is heavier than the original hydrogen atoms			0
this difference in mass , according to @entity56 's classic formula , is what gives off energy , @entity46 says			2
@entity30 has been following nuclear fusion since 1973 and his site provides a forum for aspiring fusion researchers			1
such forums allow @entity13 to exchange ideas and suggestions with hundreds of other fusion researchers			2
" i really started from scratch , " @entity12 says of his fusion reactor			1
" i was a web developer			0
i 've always been interested in this			0
i 've learned so much and mastered so many skills that i did n't know about before			0
" @entity13 ' fusion experiment is on a small scale and gives off energy that is hard to detect , so he uses a bubble detector			1
the bubble detector is filled with gel and when fusion occurs , a leftover neutron will travel through the gel , creating a bubble			2
although cosmic rays can naturally create bubbles as well , @entity12 believes he achieved fusion on june 6 when he recorded an emergence of four bubbles in two hours and 40 minutes in a breakthrough he called statistically significant			1
@entity13 has extensively detailed his endeavors on his blog and provides pictures and data to back up his claims			0
he has been blogging and building the reactor since october 2008 and has spent around $ 37,000 of his own money on the project			1
@entity30 added @entity96 to his site 's @entity97 -- a list of 38 worldwide " amateur fusioneers " -- on june 8			0
@entity46 told @entity1 he can not confirm @entity13 ' claim without more information , but he said it is definitely possible that @entity13 succeeded in achieving fusion			0
" i would not at all worry about anything being harmful to the public , " @entity46 says , adding that the scale of @entity13 ' experiment is far smaller than those that create health hazards			0
@entity13 goal now is to build " the world 's first superconducting @entity113			0
ultimately break - even fusion , " @entity12 says			1
such a project , however , will require investors and large - scale fundraising			0
@entity46 says that while @entity13 ' experiments may be amateur because they are smaller and less complex , they can be more efficient than the massive projects funded by national governments			0
" someone could come up a with a little twist that improves what we do , a little breakthrough , " @entity46 says			0
" but it still has to obey the law of physics , there is no magic			0
" according to @entity46 , the drawback to nuclear fusion now is that reactors capable of creating large enough amounts of energy cost billions of dollars and have yet to require less energy than they produce , or , " net energy			1
" if fusion reactors could produce net energy , " it would have a profound impact , because there are thousands of years of fuel available , " he says .			2
