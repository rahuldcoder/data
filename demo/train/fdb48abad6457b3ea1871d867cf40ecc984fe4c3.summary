-- your husband , an avid gamer and techie , dies of a heart attack , leaving his vast online life ­ -- one you do n't know much about ­ -- in limbo			2
eternal @entity7 lets loved ones create customized online gravesites and memorial pages			1
his accounts , to which you do n't know the passwords , go idle			2
his e-mails go unanswered , his online multiplayer games go on without him and bidders on his @entity17 items do n't know why they ca n't get an answer from the seller			2
web site domains that he has purchased , some of which are now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars , ­ will expire , and you may never know			0
it 's a scenario that 's becoming more likely as we spend more of our lives online			2
and it 's raising more questions about what happens to our online lives after we log off for the final time			2
the answer , until recently , was nothing			0
but now , as online usage increases and social - media sites soar in popularity , more companies are popping up to try and fill that void created in your digital life after death			1
@entity42 , founder of the site @entity44 , recognized that when he was on a plane and wondered what would happen to his online life if it crashed			2
while his will leaves everything to his wife , including all of his digital assets , @entity42 realized how difficult it would be for her to access his accounts			1
" my @entity56 account would belong to her , but it does n't solve the practical reality of how she would get access to it , " he said			2
he experienced a similar scenario after his grandmother died , and he tried to get the password for her e-mail account -- only to give up because of the hassle			0
so @entity42 built his company to change all that			0
@entity69 allows users to set up a kind of online will , with beneficiaries that would receive the customer 's account information and passwords after they die			1
" we know it 's a hard thing to think about -- to get people to face mortality			0
we know it 's kind of morbid , but for those who live their entire lives online , it 's also very real			1
" a @entity69 account costs $ 29.99 a year			1
users can set up their accounts at @entity87 to specify who gets access to their posthumous online information , along with " legacy letters , " or messages , that can be sent to loved ones			1
if someone contacts @entity44 to report a client 's death , the service will send the customer four e-mails in 48 hours			0
if there 's no response , @entity44 will then contact the people the client listed as verifiers in the event of his or her death			1
even then , the service would not release digital assets without examining a copy of the customer 's death certificate , @entity42 said			1
@entity113 is the kind of tech - savvy guy for which a service such as @entity44 was made			0
the @entity117 , @entity118 , man has three online banking accounts , a @entity122 account , domain names , web - hosting accounts , multiple e-mail addresses and many social - networking accounts			1
" i do think this is something people should be really considering these days , " @entity113 told @entity0 when asked about services such as @entity44			1
he wants to hire a service to handle his digital assets but is concerned about privacy			1
" although i 'm glad there 's people breaking ground in this area , i do n't think i would jump at the first opportunity to sign up , " @entity113 said			0
" my concerns are turning over such an exhaustive list of user names and passwords to a single business			0
that 's one - stop shopping for any hacker to get access to just about every detail of my life			0
" @entity113 would prefer to entrust half of his digital - security information to a service such as @entity69 and the other half to family members , so that each side 's information would be useless without the other 's			1
" i hope @entity44 and similar services can address these privacy - security concerns with some real - world solutions , " he said			0
" i just do n't feel comfortable turning over my digital life -- built over 15 years -- to a kind promise			1
" @entity44 is n't the only new company helping techies plan for death in the digital age			1
@entity165 ( formerly @entity166 ) offers a " secure safe deposit box " for digital copies of documents , wishes , letters and e-mails			0
@entity172 and @entity173 also offer similar services in a variety of prices and packages , depending on how many accounts are involved			1
not all of these services deal with online assets			1
there 's also a growing trend towards giving all aspects of death -- ­ the grieving process , the funeral , the memorial and even the grave site -- ­ a digital makeover			1
@entity191 claims to have cemetery records for 32 million people in its searchable database , while @entity196 offers a new spin on the traditional grave site by offering virtual memorial pages ­ full of videos , pictures and tributes			2
on @entity7 , loved ones can choose from different headstones and bucolic landscape backgrounds -- the mountain lake is a popular option -- to create a customized online grave site			1
loved ones can add " tribute gifts " such as roses , candles , stuffed animals and other items , while mourners can access photos and videos in a " @entity212 " and leave remembrances of their own			2
@entity219 , president of @entity7 president , is trying to bring the funeral experience to anyone who can access the @entity223			1
in that way , he hopes to provide a gathering place , and a voice , for mourners who may not be able to attend the real - life memorial service			0
" it 'd be the equivalent of a funeral where everyone can attend and everyone can spend 30 minutes behind the podium , " @entity219 said			0
" it gives everyone a chance to put a 360 - degree wrapper on the life the person lived and celebrate that life from how every person knew them			0
" eternal @entity7 's virtual memorial sites are currently only being offered through select funeral homes , cemeteries and crematoriums			1
@entity219 ' hope is that the site will help allow the deceased 's memory to be " eternally " passed on			0
" all of these stories and videos are being left , in essence , to this @entity7 web site so that everyone can share , not just that day , not the days after , but the weeks after and years after , " he said			2
some funeral - industry professionals believe these online memorials and virtual grave sites provide a valuable service			1
" assuming the site is handled with respect , virtual memorials respond to a basic human need to remember our deceased family , friends and colleagues , " said @entity260 , general counsel for the @entity261			0
" based on our members ' feedback , i 'd have to say that virtual memorial sites are gaining popularity with the public as a very practical alternative to being present at the grave site , " he added			2
" there 's nothing ' weird ' about them as far as we have seen			0
" " there are funeral homes out there that will help families create virtual memorials , but ... we 've also seen @entity289 and @entity291 profiles of deceased persons being turned into memorials , " agreed @entity282 , spokesperson for the @entity283			0
" consumers have become increasingly comfortable with expressing their grief online			0
" " while not a replacement for a funeral , online memorialization can help people work through their grief after the funeral , " she added			2
" we 've all become accustomed to communicating and expressing ourselves electronically -- via e-mail , @entity289 , @entity303			0
expressing one 's grief online is an outgrowth of what 's happening in other areas of our lives			0
" @entity0 's @entity310 contributed to this story .			0
