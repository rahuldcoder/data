allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by the @entity3 regime last week have heightened tensions internationally			2
there 's been tough talk from @entity8 leaders and a flurry of activity by the @entity11 -- all of which seem to suggest that a military strike against the regime could be in the offing			0
but through it all , @entity3 seems to retain the support of some good friends			2
why do @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 continue to support a regime that 's accused of slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians in the 2 - year - old civil war ? here 's why			1
who wants what after chemical weapons horror @entity19 why it cares : two main reasons : one has to do with economics ; the other with ideology			2
a ) @entity33 : @entity19 is one of @entity3 's biggest arms suppliers			1
@entity3 contracts with the @entity19 defense industry have likely exceeded $ 4 billion , according to @entity38 , an adjunct fellow with the @entity39 and @entity40			1
he noted the @entity41 estimated the value of @entity19 arms sales to @entity3 at $ 162 million per year in both 2009 and 2010			1
@entity44 also signed a $ 550 million deal with @entity3 for combat training jets			2
@entity19 also leases a naval facility at the @entity3 port of @entity49 , giving the @entity19 navy its only direct access to the @entity52 , @entity38 said			1
b ) ideology : @entity19 's key policy goal is blocking @entity11 efforts to shape the region			2
@entity19 does n't believe revolutions , wars and regime change bring stability and democracy			2
it often points to the @entity62 and the @entity11 - led war in @entity64 as evidence			0
@entity19 also does n't trust @entity11 intentions in the region			2
it believes humanitarian concerns are often used an excuse for pursuing @entity11 's own political and economic interests			0
" @entity19 's backing of ( @entity3 president @entity75 ) @entity73 is not only driven by the need to preserve its naval presence in the @entity52 , secure its energy contracts , or counter the @entity79 on ' regime change , ' " said @entity71 , an associate program director at @entity72			1
" it also stems from ( @entity19 president @entity84 ) @entity83 's existential fear for his own survival and the survival of the repressive system that he and @entity73 represent			1
in @entity83 's universe , @entity73 can not lose because it means that one day he , @entity83 , might as well			2
" what it 's saying : foreign minister @entity92 insists there 's no proof yet @entity3 's government is behind the chemical weapons attack			2
and any plans to strike @entity3 would challenge provisions of the @entity101 charter , the ministry said			2
the ministry accused @entity103 of trying to " create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention			0
" on wednesday , @entity19 walked out of a @entity107 meeting where @entity108 was expected to pursue a resolution to authorize the use of force against @entity3			1
" the @entity79 handles the @entity114 world the way a monkey handles a grenade , " @entity19 deputy prime minister @entity112 tweeted			2
why it matters : @entity19 is a permanent member of the @entity107			2
it has the power to veto @entity107 resolutions against the @entity3 regime and has done so repeatedly over the past two years			2
so , if the @entity11 and its allies are relying on a @entity101 mandate to greenlight a military strike , they may be waiting a long time			0
chemical weapons in @entity3 : how did we get here ? @entity20 why it cares : @entity20 and @entity3 are bound by two factors : religion and strategy			1
a ) religion : @entity20 is the world 's most populous @entity133 nation			1
the @entity3 government is dominated by @entity136 , a @entity133 offshoot , and the rebels are dominated by @entity139			1
that connection has bound them for quite a while			0
@entity20 counted on @entity3 as its only @entity144 ally during its eight - year war with @entity64			1
@entity64 was @entity139 - dominated			0
the last thing @entity20 wants now is a @entity139 - dominated @entity3 -- especially as the rebels ' main supporters are @entity20 's @entity150 rivals : @entity151 and @entity152			1
b ) strategy : for @entity20 , @entity3 is also a strategically key ally			1
it 's @entity20 's main conduit to the @entity133 militia @entity160 in @entity161 , the proxy through which @entity20 can threaten @entity156 with an arsenal of short - range missiles			1
in 2009 , the top @entity11 diplomat in @entity163 disclosed that @entity3 had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to @entity160 , according to official cables leaked to and published by @entity167			0
so , it 's in @entity20 's interest to see @entity73 's regime remain intact			1
western intelligence officials believe the @entity172 has provided technical help such as intelligence , communications and advice on crowd control and weapons as protests in @entity3 morphed into resistance			0
a @entity101 panel reported in may that @entity20 weapons destined for @entity3 but seized in @entity183 included assault rifles , explosives , detonators , machine guns and mortar shells			1
@entity189 of @entity190 believes the @entity20 must be alarmed that the tide is turning against @entity73			1
" @entity20 probably has excellent information regarding @entity73 's position			1
that information would make clear that @entity20 is increasingly likely to lose its only ally in the region , greatly reducing its strategic reach , " he said			0
what 's it saying : @entity20 has cast events in @entity3 as part of a much broader ideological battle			1
it 's a " war between the front of hegemony and the front of resistance , " @entity202 ayatollah @entity201 has said			0
@entity20 's position , as outlined by foreign minister @entity208 and new president @entity209 , is that the @entity3 government is a victim of international plots			1
@entity20 believes the @entity79 and almost all @entity144 countries are in cahoots in an effort to implement regime change in @entity3			1
@entity20 says the main objective of this plot is to make the region safer for @entity156			0
this week , @entity208 warned of " graver conditions " in @entity3 is attacked			0
" if any country attacks another when it wants , that is like the @entity224 , " @entity208 said wednesday			0
why it matters : many believe @entity20 is @entity103 's greatest threat in the region , especially with its nuclear potential			0
it 's unclear how @entity20 might respond if @entity3 is attacked			1
but the rhetoric certainly has been ominous			0
" starting this fire will be like a spark in a large store of gunpowder , with unclear and unspecified outcomes and consequences , " @entity201 told @entity20 @entity232 members this week			0
" the @entity11 threats and possible intervention in @entity3 is a disaster for the region and if such an act is done , certainly , the @entity11 will sustain damage like when they interfered in @entity64 and @entity245			0
" what justifies intervening if @entity3 uses chemical weapons ? @entity21 why it cares : @entity21 's relationship with @entity3 is more nuanced			1
some say it wants to maintain its financial ties			0
it was ranked as @entity3 's third - largest importer in 2010 , according to data from the @entity253			0
" @entity255 's renewed interest in @entity163 -- the traditional terminus node of the ancient @entity257 ... indicates that @entity21 sees @entity3 as an important trading hub , " according to a 2010 report from the @entity260 , a @entity103 - based research and analysis institute			1
but there 's a bigger factor at play			0
@entity21 has said foreign countries should n't meddle in @entity3 's internal affairs -- and perhaps for good reason			2
@entity21 has had its own share of international controversies over its policies with @entity271 as well as allegations of human rights violations			0
finally , @entity21 does n't want to reprise what happened with @entity275			0
it abstained from a @entity107 resolution on that one , clearing the way for a @entity280 military intervention in @entity275			0
" it was rather disappointed with the payoff , " said @entity281 of the @entity282 , writing in the @entity284 's @entity283			0
" neither the @entity79 nor the @entity286 ( @entity286 ) showed much appreciation for @entity21 's abstention			0
" so , he says , @entity21 has " formulated a far more sophisticated hedging strategy " when it comes to @entity3			2
" rather than siding with either @entity73 or the opposition and standing aside to ' wait and see , ' @entity255 is actively betting on both			0
" what 's it saying : @entity21 said it is firmly opposed to the use of chemical weapons and supports the @entity101 's chemical weapons inspectors			0
it also said it wants a political solution for @entity3 -- though some say hopes for such an ending have waned			1
" a political solution is always the only realistic means to resolve the @entity3 issue , " foreign minister @entity300 said			1
like @entity19 , @entity21 also walked out of wednesday 's @entity107 meeting where @entity108 planned to pursue a resolution on @entity3			1
why it matters : @entity21 is a permanent member of the @entity107			0
and like @entity19 , @entity21 has repeatedly blocked sanctions attempts against the @entity3 regime -- leading to a perpetual stalemate at the @entity101 body to take any serious action on @entity3			1
' red line ' debate : chemical weapons worse than attacks ?			0

@entity19 has sold billions of *dollars* in arms to @entity3
@entity20 is the most populous @entity133 nation ; @entity73 is @entity136 , a @entity133 offshoot
@entity21 said it still wants to see a political solution in @entity3
