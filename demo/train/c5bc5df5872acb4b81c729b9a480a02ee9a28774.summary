-- @entity2 's opposition says the once - bustling commercial capital of @entity4 might soon fall victim to a crushing siege if government troop advances continue unabated			1
fears of encirclement rose after the @entity2 army , backed by pro-government militias , wrested control of the @entity14 neighborhood and the nearby village of @entity16 , a strategic industrial area at the northeastern entrance to @entity4 city			1
government troops also advanced toward central @entity4 from the western suburbs , most of which it controls , including the @entity24 district along the key @entity25			2
rebels called the defeats a strategic withdrawal and announced the formation of a 600 - strong elite force to combat the escalating offensive , the opposition - run @entity26 reported			0
the @entity2 military is focused on capturing the @entity36 settlement , which links the opposition - controlled neighborhoods of @entity4 city with the @entity39 border			1
if successful , the @entity2 government will be in a position to besiege an estimated 300,000 civilians and isolate fighters from a vital supply line , the @entity40 tells @entity0			1
" the rebels are fortifying themselves on the edge of the city " @entity46 , a spokesman for the @entity26 told @entity0 , " but residents fear a siege			0
" fighters from the @entity52 , a @entity2 paramilitary group , and the @entity56 @entity55 militia @entity54 arrived in @entity4 ahead of what activists believe will be a full - scale assault on @entity60			1
" this will be the route to death , " @entity61 , head of @entity4 's @entity40 , tells @entity0 , " the humanitarian crisis will be huge , and the civilians will pay the price			0
" the @entity68 accuses @entity2 of a " kneel or starve " tactic on areas that turned against the government of president @entity72 during the country 's more than three - year uprising turned civil war			2
a nearly two - year encirclement of the @entity77 of @entity78 drew widespread international condemnation earlier this year when activists reported hungry families were forced to pick grass for food , and in the still besieged @entity25 suburbs , dozens have died because of a lack of basic medical supplies and food , doctors inside @entity2 told @entity0 earlier this year			2
radical threat to the west an altogether different threat faces rebels in the western @entity4 countryside , where the ultraradical @entity95 controls three main cities , including a key position in @entity98 along the @entity39 border			1
the group recently launched an offensive on much of the @entity103 eastern countryside of @entity4 after announcing the creation of a so - called " @entity105 " stretching from central @entity2 to @entity106 , @entity107 , with the head of the group @entity110 as the self - styled @entity111			1
militants captured three @entity103 villages in @entity4 province near the ethnic minority 's stronghold of @entity117 this week , according to the @entity119 - based monitoring group the @entity118			2
the @entity121 's @entity120 , a @entity103 militia , evacuated about 2,000 civilians from the area and clashed with @entity95 on tuesday in an attempt to recapture the villages			2

" the whole area has been turned into a battle ground , but the people have no choice			0
they must stay strong , and we must defend ourselves , " @entity134 , the head of external relations in the local branch of the @entity138 , which administers @entity117 , told @entity0			0
after @entity95 captured tanks and @entity68 humvees in a sweeping campaign on the @entity147 heartland of @entity107 , the group intensified its march on @entity103 and rebel - held parts of @entity4 province in @entity2 , multiple activists tell @entity0			1
" we do not want anything from @entity95 ; we just want them to not come into our areas and impose their rule			0
we do not want their caliphate , " @entity134 said			0
the intensification of fighting stalled talks for the release of more than a 120 @entity103 students kidnapped in may by @entity95 and forced to take daily classes in ultraradical @entity95 theology			0
the families of the abducted ninth grades say their children are being brainwashed and have appealed to the international community for help			1
" i still have hope the children will be released			0
we remain steadfast , and we ask @entity95 to call a cease - fire for just 24 hours so we can find a way to return the students to their families , " @entity134 said			0
who is the @entity95 ? constant aerial bombardment for civilians , the skies are the third and arguably the most threatening front in the battle for @entity4			1
" fear @entity189 ! " an elderly women yells on a social media post after her neighborhood of @entity187 was barrel - bombed by government warplanes , " they have destroyed our homes and killed our children			0
" the @entity2 army appears to have escalated the use of barrel bombs , crudely constructed weapons packed with explosives and dropped indiscriminately , on @entity4 since the launch of the ground offensive last week , activists tell @entity0			1
" where in the world is it ok to drop hundreds of kilos of explosives from thousands of meters in the sky on a densely populated civilian area ? " @entity61 tells @entity0			0
" the international community must stop the killing			1
" @entity2 's protracted civil war has claimed the lives of at least 140,000 people , including hundreds killed by barrel bombs , human rights groups report			1
thousands more fled what the opposition dubs the " barrels of death " to join the more 2.9 million refugees struggling to survive in neighboring countries			0
" the regime is fighting us with rockets and bombs from the sky and @entity95 is firing mortar and tank shells on the ground			1
how can the revolution stand up to all this ? @entity61 tells @entity0			0
" this is why we need the international community to intervene			2
" how @entity95 is overshadowing @entity232 @entity233 considers how to target @entity95 leader in drone strike			2

with help from militias , @entity2 government has retaken strategic roads and villages
to make matters worse for rebels , @entity95 bombards them to their west
another factor : deadly barrel bombs dropped from the sky
" the international community must stop the killing , " @entity4 council leader pleads
