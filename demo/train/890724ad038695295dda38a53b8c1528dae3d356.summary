-- if you 're traveling by air this month , there 's a good chance the government owes you money			0
do n't believe me ? you can thank @entity8 and its inability to reauthorize the @entity10			2
here 's how you can get your money back , though be prepared to wait a little while for things to settle			0
@entity8 periodically has to renew the authorization of the @entity10 to do a variety of things , and one of those things is collecting taxes on air travel			1
as with everything in @entity23 , the left and the right all try to sneak in politically charged riders that prevent the @entity10 reauthorization from moving forward to fund important projects such as the @entity31 air traffic control overhaul			1
until last month , @entity8 had been simply extending the current authorization for months at a time until something could be worked out			0
that changed on july 23			1
when july 22 ended , so did the current authorization for the @entity10 and that meant it could no longer collect taxes			1
there was hope that once the debt - ceiling bill was passed , attention would shift to getting the @entity10 back up and running , but both chambers decided to take the month off			2
then thursday , congressional leaders reached a deal to resume funding temporarily for the @entity10 , and the @entity47 passed the legislation on friday			2
secrets to avoiding flight delays when @entity10 authorization ended , four taxes on air travel had to be dropped : the 7.5 % tax on the base airline ticket price the domestic segment tax of $ 3.70 per person per segment ( a single takeoff and single landing ) the international travel facilities tax of $ 16.30 per person for flights that begin or end in the @entity64 , or $ 8.20 per person for a flight that begins or ends in @entity67 or @entity68 the 6.25 % tax on the amount paid for transporting property by air as you can see , this applies to both domestic and international flights on any airline , regardless of where it 's based			1
so if you bought a round - trip ticket going from @entity80 , @entity81 , to @entity82 via @entity83 for $ 500 , here 's how the taxes and fees break down : base fare -- $ 425.30 7.5 % excise tax -- $ 31.90 domestic segment tax -- $ 14.80 ( $ 3.70 per flight segment ) september 11 security fee -- $ 10 ( $ 2.50 per flight segment ) passenger facility charges -- $ 18 ( $ 4.50 per departure from each airport ) the passenger would be owed $ 46.70 for the excise and segment taxes if this ticket was purchased before july 23 for travel since the @entity10 shutdown			1
summer travel : watch out for amateurs so if you bought your ticket before july 23 for travel between july 23 and , well , whenever the @entity10 comes back to life , then you can get a refund for the taxes that you paid at the time of purchase			1
if you bought a ticket beginning on july 23 , then you were n't charged those taxes			1
if the @entity10 is reauthorized before you take that trip , then you probably wo n't have to pay back taxes			2
while @entity8 could try to collect , it would be virtually impossible to make it happen and ill - advised to even try			0
the @entity117 has issued guidelines on how exactly to go about getting your refund			1
first stop ? the place where you bought your ticket			0
if you booked through a travel agent , go back to that agent and ask for help getting the refund			2
your agent will be able to keep on top of the news to see how and when to make this happen			0
i would n't , however , bother doing it until your trip is completed so that you know exactly how much is owed to you			0
( if you file for a refund after your first flight , then you have no way of knowing if the @entity10 will again be collecting taxes by the time you return			1
) if you booked directly , talk to your airline			0
so far , few airlines have issued much guidance			0
we do know that both @entity143 and @entity144 have committed to refund the taxes directly to the travelers			0
@entity143 says it will issue a refund " once an agreement is reached with the @entity117 on the procedure for doing so			1
" @entity144 said effectively the same thing			0
other airlines , however , have either given no clarification or have sent people back to the @entity117			2
@entity155 , for example , is telling customers to go directly to the @entity117 to get money back			2
to do that , however , is also an undefined process			0
according to the @entity117 , travelers must " submit proof of taxes paid and travel dates to the @entity117 under procedures that are under development			1
the @entity117 will provide additional guidance at a later date			0
" in other words , if you bought your ticket before july 23 and are traveling after , you are owed money			1
we just do n't know how you 'll get that money back yet			0
i imagine the @entity117 is hoping people do n't make their claims and the agency can pocket the extra cash , but the money is rightfully yours			0
keep all your documents for completed travel and stayed tuned for updates on the @entity117 procedures .			1
