@entity0 -- the family of @entity5 , who died in november after he was beaten on a bus , allegedly as part of a @entity9 band hazing ritual , will sue the bus company , their attorney said tuesday			1

the family is suing fabulous coach lines , based in @entity18 , @entity19 , he said			2
" we do anticipate , in the very near future , filing a legal action against the bus company alleging negligence and wrongful death , " @entity14 told reporters at a news conference tuesday			1
such a lawsuit will allow him to file subpoenas and take witness statements to further the investigation , he said			0
part of that investigation will include determining what bus company employee was assigned to the bus , how it was running and how an estimated 30 people were on the bus long enough for @entity13 to be beaten to death			1
@entity9 is protected under sovereign immunity , and the family must file a statutory notice of intent to sue and wait six months to file suit against the school , @entity14 said			1
@entity45 , president of @entity17 , told @entity1 the company 's employees , who were not on the bus at the time , responded quickly after learning there was an emergency -- even following the ambulance transporting champion to the hospital , taking other band members there			1
" we did transport our passengers safely from point a to point b as contracted , " @entity45 said			0
when employees were notified of an emergency on board one of the nine buses in the convoy , " we responded just as quickly and effectively as we could			1
" the company has already received some documents , he said , and " we 're addressing those with our lawyers now			2
" asked if a company employee was on the bus at the time of @entity13 's beating , he said a driver was not in the seat on the bus , but the drivers had congregated together looking over the nine vehicles			1
the drivers rushed over to the bus after learning of a problem , he said			2
some band members have said champion , 26 , died after taking part in a rite of passage called " crossing @entity86 " one band member , who spoke on condition of anonymity , previously explained that students " walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members , and you get beaten until you get to the back			1
" @entity14 said tuesday he 's heard the ritual may have happened before on fabulous coach lines			0
however , @entity45 said the bus company has " never seen this kind of behavior " from the band previously			1
" it 's completely out of the blue , " he said of the lawsuit			0
" it was n't an auto accident			0
it was n't a crash			0
if two passengers get in a fight , and one gets injured , i do n't know how that 's the motorcoach company 's liability			2
" @entity14 said his team has spoken to " in excess of 15 people " during the preliminary investigation			0
friends of @entity13 have told @entity14 during his investigation that @entity13 was gay , the attorney said			1
relatives believe that may have been one of many factors that contributed to his being treated more severely than other band members , @entity14 said			0
however , he said , @entity13 's homosexuality is not believed to have been a primary factor in the beating			1
" this is not a hate crime			0
this is a hazing crime , " he said			2
" @entity9 has a 50 - year history , a culture in this band , of hazing			1
" the family thinks some people might have been jealous of @entity13 , a stickler for the rules who stood up against hazing , he said			1
" @entity5 was defined by the fact that he followed the rules , " @entity14 said			2
champion also may have been about to become the band 's lead drum major , @entity14 said			0
band director @entity151 , who 's on administrative leave from his post , said at @entity13 's funeral november 30 he regretted not telling him he had been selected to be the band 's next head drum major			1
@entity13 's mother , @entity157 , told reporters tuesday her son " loved his music			2
he was very serious about how he did and the position he was in			0
" champion collapsed in @entity0 on the bus , which was carrying members of @entity9 's @entity166 after a november football game that included a halftime performance by the group			1
@entity14 has charged that @entity13 died after receiving " some dramatic blows , perhaps ( having an ) elevated heart rate " tied to " a hazing ritual " that took place on the bus			1
the medical examiner 's office ruled his death a homicide and said champion " collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body			1
" an autopsy conducted after his death found " extensive contusions of his chest , arms , shoulder and back , " as well as " evidence of crushing of areas of subcutaneous fat , " which is the fatty tissue directly under the skin			0
" when a crime victim is targeted because of his or her identity , it can have devastating effects on communities , " said @entity195 , spokesman for the @entity196			0
" the allegation that @entity5 may have been singled out because of who he was must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted accordingly			2
" the death prompted the @entity9 board of trustees to approve a new three - part anti-hazing plan			2
the new policy was passed in a 9 - 1 vote by the board last week as the school continues to deal with the controversial death			0
champion 's mother told reporters she wants hazing to stop			0
