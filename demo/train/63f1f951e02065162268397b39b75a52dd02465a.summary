-- the maker of a mobile game highlighting the uglier side of electronics production has seen the game banned from @entity7 's @entity6 just hours after its release			1
the creators of " @entity10 " describe it as a game that " attempts to provoke a critical reflection on its own technological platform			2
" according to the developer 's website , the game involves a player in cartoon versions of real - world scenarios involving mineral mining in the @entity21 , the reported suicides of workers at an @entity7 manufacturer 's plant in @entity26 , the " planned obsolescence " of tech gadgets and the resulting environmental impact			1
as the most profitable consumer - electronics company in the world , @entity7 has been front and center of discussions about all of those issues			2
@entity36 , the game 's @entity38 developer , posted a blog item on his @entity42 feed tuesday announcing the app had been pulled under the header " @entity45 ( 13/09/2011 - 13/09/2011 )			2
" he said @entity7 cited sections of its guidelines that ban apps that depict violence or abuse toward children , " excessively objectionable or crude content " or paid apps that solicit donations to causes			1
the game 's website says proceeds go to workers ' groups and other nonprofit organizations			0
in response , @entity61 said he 's planning a new app that " depicts the violence and abuse of children involved in the electronic manufacturing supply chain in a noncrude and nonobjectionable way			1

the report describes nets strung around the building after a rash of worker suicides			1
@entity97 and other organizations have decried the way coltan , a mineral necessary for mobile phones , is mined in the @entity21 -- where there are reports of bloody violence to control the coltan trade and deadly conditions for workers held in slavelike conditions			0
one @entity97 documentary calls it " @entity112 , " comparing the mineral to the " blood diamonds " mined in some @entity116 nations			0
and environmental groups such as @entity118 have blasted @entity7 's environmental impact , saying its products contain hazardous chemicals and their short life spans have led to massive waste			1
on its site , @entity7 lists " supplier responsibility " actions it takes to ensure " the highest standards of social responsibility wherever our products are made			0
" " we insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect , and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes , " the page says			0
