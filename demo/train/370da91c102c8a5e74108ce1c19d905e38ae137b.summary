-- @entity1 opened the door to the introduction of goal - line technology at the @entity5 , but has put in place a rigorous testing program for companies hoping to win the contract			1
the world governing body said tuesday that prototype systems will need to demonstrate a 90 % accuracy rate in order to get through the first phase of the bidding process from september to december this year			2
they must then return with a 100 % accurate product for the second and final testing phase between march and june 2012			2
the @entity19 , the game 's law - making body , will be presented with the results of the testing at a special meeting in july 2012			1
if the @entity19 is satisfied with the accuracy of the system , it could be in place for football 's global showcase in @entity30 two years later			0
blog : has the time arrived for change in football ? @entity1 said that the second round of tests would be held in " different lighting conditions " to simulate those likely to be found in the @entity39 country			0
pressure has grown on @entity1 since this year 's @entity5 in @entity41 after @entity42 's disallowed goal for @entity44 in the second - round match against @entity46			1
replays showed the ball had clearly crossed the line and @entity1 later softened its stance on the introduction of technology			2
there have been renewed calls for action after last weekend 's @entity57 match between @entity58 and @entity59			0
ironically , this time midfielder @entity42 benefited from the status quo as he was awarded a crucial goal despite tv replays showing @entity59 goalkeeper @entity64 had prevented it crossing the line after his fumble			0
@entity70 company @entity68 , whose products are used in international cricket , is expected to be one of the companies to take part in the process			0
preliminary tests held at @entity1 headquarters in february saw 10 companies under the spotlight and all failed the 100 % criteria , but it is believed three came close .			1
