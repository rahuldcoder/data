" sports personalities are tweeting now			2
they are giving fans a reason to tune in to see their comments , " says @entity45 , managing editor of @entity46 , a blog devoted to online social media			0
@entity45 believes social networking sites like @entity10 allow athletes to connect directly with fans without the filter of the traditional media			1
and while many athletes and teams have blogs and @entity40 profiles , @entity10 allows for a more personal connection between fan and sports , he says			1
@entity5 all - star @entity62 ( @ the_real_shaq ) is both a prolific scorer and a prolific twitterer			1

@entity118 ( @ @entity117 ) baseball commentators and reporters are using @entity10 to share tidbits from players and behind - the - scenes moments that the normal fan may not even think about			1
@entity118 play - by - play announcer @entity123 , one of the network 's wittier twitterers , shared this recent tender moment from the broadcast booth : " @entity123 : cold in the booth in @entity130			2
@entity131 [ @entity132 ] and i are bundled up			0
i think hypothermia is starting to set in ! " @entity3 is using the same approach to connect with basketball fans during the current @entity5 playoffs			1
eleven members of the network 's broadcast team have joined @entity10 to provide insight into games , offer nuggets from players and solicit fan opinions			2
" @entity3 is an interesting experiment if they add analysis they do n't give on tv , " said @entity45 of @entity46			2
" more interesting if they give more non-basketball info			0
when @entity6 started on @entity10 , he was n't really sure what it was or how it would work			2

" i love scavenger hunts			0
i might leave tickets to the conference finals somewhere and leave clues on my @entity10			2
" @entity10 gives announcers another way to connect with sports fans , @entity6 said			1
" you can give an attitude [ on @entity10 ] , " he said			2
" they can hear you on the air , but [ on @entity10 , they ] get to hear your voice			2
" @entity6 hopes to continue revealing " behind - the - scenes " details in his tweets , because he wants his more than 1,000 followers to feel like they are there			1
and he plans to continue twittering beyond the @entity5 playoffs			1
increasingly , sports fans use social networking to talk back			2
for the @entity182 playoffs , the @entity86 recently organized " tweetups " where @entity10 users met face - to - face to talk about whatever brought them together			1
events were organized in 21 cities in the @entity188 and @entity189			0
