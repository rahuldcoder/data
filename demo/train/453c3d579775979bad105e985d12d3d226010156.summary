@entity0 -- two @entity3 supervisors who have lost their jobs in a prostitute scandal during a recent trip to @entity7 are @entity8 and @entity9 , a source familiar with the investigation told @entity1 national security contributor @entity12 on thursday			1
they are among three people no longer with the agency in the wake of the incident immediately preceding president @entity19 's trip to @entity7 for the @entity20			1
they are among 11 total @entity3 employees who are under investigation			1
attorney @entity24 told @entity1 that he is representing @entity25 and @entity9 , but declined further comment , including why he is representing the two men			1
@entity28 is general counsel for the @entity29 , a union that includes the @entity3 , among other agencies			1
authorities outside @entity25 's home in @entity33 , @entity34 , said that @entity25 had relayed that he did not want to speak to reporters outside			1
@entity3 pushing out three members amid @entity7 scandal @entity25 is identified as one of several hundred people -- including about 22 from the @entity41 -- who contributed to the @entity42 on @entity43 , according to the group 's @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity48 annual reports			1
created in 1998 , that organization 's mission is " to make recommendations to the president for improving the coordination , efficiency , and effectiveness of @entity58 - sponsored international exchanges and training , " according to its website			0
a posting from @entity8 on @entity61 states that he graduated from @entity62 in @entity63 in 1982 and had been employed with the @entity3 since 1987			1
that message notes that he is married , has an adopted son and his assignments include a stint protecting former vice president @entity68			0
@entity25 's father was a @entity3 agent , said the source with knowledge of the investigation			1
@entity9 supervised the canine training unit at the @entity3 's @entity74 outside @entity0 , according to @entity75 and a career development posting on the @entity78 's website			1
the agency has said that one of those who left the agency is a supervisory employee who is being allowed to retire			0
another employee resigned , the agency said			0
a third agent -- also a supervisory employee -- is being pushed out , with the agency proposing he be removed			0
a @entity88 official said on condition of not being identified that this agent plans to fight his ouster			1
it was not immediately clear whether this person was @entity25 or @entity9			1
@entity95 chairman rep. @entity94 , @entity97 - @entity96 , told @entity1 on thursday that he expects more @entity3 employees to leave the agency as soon as friday			2
the other eight members allegedly involved in the scandal are on administrative leave and have had their security clearances suspended , according to the @entity3			1
ten military personnel are also being investigated for their possible participation			0
questions raised about macho culture , women agents they were all part of the " jump team " that flies in on military transport planes with the presidential limousine and other vehicles to be used in the president 's motorcade , @entity12 said			0
they arrived the morning of the incident , raising questions about whether the activity was planned			0
all the employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to @entity125 's @entity124 ahead of last week 's visit by @entity19 , who was there to attend the @entity129 summit			0
according to sources , the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- had all signed in at the hotel , where the @entity3 members apparently stayed , flashing their local id cards			1
one of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night			0
that row brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the @entity88 and @entity7			1
despite concerns that contact with @entity7 nationals could have led to security breaches regarding president @entity19 's activities in the @entity151 nation , @entity94 said , " from everything we know , nothing was compromised			2
" former @entity7 president @entity155 told @entity1 on thursday that he rejects " the idea that @entity125 is a destination for tourists seeking prostitution or illicit drugs			2
" he said the incident is due entirely to " a lack of ethics ( on the part of ) the @entity3 of the @entity88			1
" @entity88 congressmen offered similarly biting remarks			2
@entity168 minority leader @entity167 of @entity169 called the allegations " disgusting , " while senate majority leader @entity171 described the agents ' alleged actions " either really stupid or a total lack of common sense			0
" at least five investigations have , or will soon , be launched as a result			0
one @entity3 inquiry aims to get details and accountability regarding the specific incident , and the agency is also looking to bring in outsiders to examine whether this case is symptomatic of broader problems			2
the @entity187 's leaders sent a letter to the @entity3 requesting specifics about what happened before , during and after the incident			2
and after saying he wanted a " minute - by - minute , hour - by - hour account of what happened , " @entity94 said four investigators from his homeland security panel are looking into the matter and may go to @entity7			2
in addition to the @entity3 employees , five members of @entity200 's elite @entity199 , or @entity199 , plus two people from the @entity202 , two from the @entity203 and one from the @entity205 are being questioned , a @entity88 official said			1
the @entity199 ' failure to make curfew the night of the incident involving the @entity3 agents led the military to start its own investigation , a @entity88 official told @entity1			1
officials said they are based at @entity215 , in @entity217 's @entity216 , and belong to the 7th @entity199 , which operates mostly in @entity200			0
all the military personnel are being investigated for heavy drinking and use of prostitutes while in @entity7 as part of the support team for @entity19 's visit , the official said			2
they are not likely to redeploy until the matter is resolved , other military officials said , though no formal order bars their deployment			0
the military investigation could end with no action , administrative action like a letter of reprimand or a recommendation to proceed with criminal charges , officials said			0
@entity88 rep. @entity238 , @entity34 , has called for @entity239 , the head of the @entity3 , to be among those who lose their jobs in the wake of the incident			1
" there 's only so many strikes you get , in baseball it 's three , " said @entity238 , a senior member of the @entity244 , referencing a 2009 security breach in which a @entity34 couple crashed @entity19 's first @entity168 state dinner , as well as agency 's apparent overspending in that same year			2
however , @entity94 and others came to the defense of @entity239 , who has directed the @entity3 since may 2006 and been with the agency since 1983			2
sen. @entity258 , @entity259 , said he believes the agency 's director is taking " serious action , " noting polygraph tests have been administered			0
and @entity187 chairman rep. @entity264 , @entity169 , said he has a high level of confidence in @entity239			0
@entity239 has told subordinates to use " all tools available " to conduct the investigation , one source said			2
the @entity3 agents and officers being investigated range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20 - year veterans , two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said monday			1
each agent was offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test , according to a @entity88 official			0
some of the agents and military personnel maintain they did n't know the women were prostitutes , the official said			0
even so , @entity94 said , " it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive			0
" while soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in @entity7 , it is considered a breach of the @entity3 's conduct code , government sources said			1
military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes , engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or , for enlisted personnel , conduct " prejudicial to good order and discipline			0
" @entity1 's @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 and @entity312 contributed to this report .			0
