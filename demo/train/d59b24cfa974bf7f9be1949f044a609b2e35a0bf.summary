-- our bikes rattle over the cobbles as we leave @entity4 in central @entity5 and nose our way toward the @entity8			2
on july 9 , this stone arch memorial to the thousands killed in battles around this pretty @entity13 market town between 1914 and 1918 , will see the riders of the @entity15 pass through			1
the centenary of @entity16 looms large over this year 's @entity15 and organizers have ensured that the race pays fitting tribute to the millions who lost their lives on the @entity23			1
stages also go through the @entity26 and @entity27 , key sites where @entity28 and @entity30 forces engaged in a brutal war of attrition			2
these stages are also a fitting way to commemorate riders of the prewar races who lost their lives in the fighting			2
@entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 , winners of the tour in 1907/8 , 1909 and 1910 respectively , were all killed in action			0
@entity44 , who raced in the first tour in 1903 , was among the first @entity13 to be killed in august 1914			1
cycling a way of life this year is the first time that the @entity15 passes through @entity5 and , despite the air of remembrance , excitement is building			1
cycling is a way of life here , with the " @entity15 tackling some of the pretty , winding country lanes of the surrounding region			1
my guide , @entity59 , fully kitted out in @entity60 , hands me gingerbread for much - needed energy as we read the myriad names on the walls of the @entity8 before we take on another cobbled lane and leave the town behind			0
the route to @entity69 follows wider , main roads , so @entity59 leads us away from the traffic to explore the excellent tourist riding routes that the local government has signposted			1
soon , we 're heaving up a 12 % gradient climb to the top of one of the few hills in this flat region			2
the views back to the spires of the churches in @entity5 are huge and it 's easy to see why this high ground was treasured by the @entity30 during the war			2
it allowed them to launch massive attacks on the town , which was flattened by artillery and completely rebuilt during the 1920s			0
loudest explosion ever we press on , cycling to the @entity92 , a pretty pond surrounded by trees that 's just one of a number of craters created after a series of huge explosions under @entity30 lines in june 1917			2
at the time it was the loudest explosion ever and its noise could even be heard in @entity103			0
across the road from this once barren place is @entity106 , a beautifully maintained spot where @entity28 miners killed in the explosions were laid to rest			0
it 's hard to square such chaos and noise with the peace and quiet that abounds in this now green corner of @entity13			1
back in @entity5 after a 45 - kilometer ( 28 mile ) ride that also takes in a thigh - stinging cobbled climb to the towering @entity118 at the top of @entity120 , i call in at the @entity121 ( +32 57 23 92 20 ) to meet researcher @entity122			0
her team is currently pulling together a display detailing the history of sports and @entity16 , with cycling a large part of their focus			1
in the hushed reading room , she explains about @entity13 troops cycling into battle in the early days of the war			1
she shows me photos of soldiers and their trusty steeds			2
with the dawn of war , racing bikes were replaced by more stout models , as a modern form of cavalry briefly held sway over the @entity23			0
battlefield perspective the next morning i opt for a leisurely ride to see more of the key battlefield sights and cemeteries			0
i ease my bike out of @entity5 and follow the designated @entity148 , which takes in the @entity149 ( @entity28 ) cemetery , the ruins of the much fought over @entity152 , the superb @entity153 ( +32 51 77 04 41 ) and @entity154 , where @entity30 troops lie buried			0
this ride is much less taxing than the @entity15 / @entity158 route i tried the day before and my guide @entity160 and i are able to ride side - by - side along a series of well maintained cycle paths			1
fellow riders are scarce , most tourists preferring to take a bus tour			0
riding up to these historic spots , however , affords a better idea of just what the soldiers who fought so valiantly would have gone through			1
this close to the ground , stopping every 10 minutes to see another cemetery , another crater , it 's possible to see how small the gains were for both sides , how futile the loss of life for barely 20 feet of land			2
the @entity15 may only zip through @entity5 and @entity181 , but anyone with more time than the world 's speediest cyclists would do well to rent a bike and enjoy a leisurely trip around this historic countryside			1
well marked routes , peaceful resting spots and a sense of remembrance at every turn make this a good way to reflect on the centenary of one of the most vicious wars in history			0
alternative @entity16 bike rides an excellent circular route runs from @entity200 to @entity201 and @entity202 taking in the @entity204 memorial before heading to @entity205 and the new @entity206 and trenches			1
the end point , in @entity200 , features the stunning basilica with the @entity210			0
another ride from @entity212 to the cemetery at @entity214 and then @entity215 follows in the footsteps of @entity16 poet @entity217			1
it takes in a memorial to @entity217 and his grave in @entity221 , where he fell in the last days of the war			0
also recommended is the ride from @entity224 , where the @entity225 is housed in a beautiful chateau			0
it takes in key battles of the @entity26 sights , including the @entity231 at @entity232 and the memorial museum at @entity234			0
for more information visit cycling in @entity181			1
@entity236 is a freelance travel writer			0
when not cycling stretches of the @entity15 , he can be found in @entity103 , @entity238 or wild swimming across the @entity240 for his blog @entity242 .			1
