@entity0 -- there were smiles , laughter and tears -- but little politics -- when former presidents @entity7 and his father , @entity8 , joined current president @entity9 at the @entity10 for the unveiling thursday of the younger @entity8 's official portrait			1

" he also cited @entity8 's strength and resolve that reassured the nation after the september 11 terrorist attacks , and made sure to note that anti-terrorism efforts started in the @entity8 administration helped bring the signature national security achievement of @entity9 's presidency so far -- the killing of @entity45			2
opinion : will history be kind to @entity8 ? the tone was markedly different from @entity9 's campaign themes that blame the @entity8 administration for leaving the nation in economic shambles			1
however , @entity9 mentioned the economic turmoil at the time of the transition , saying that was a reason he especially appreciated @entity8 's efforts to help make it as smooth as possible			1
" after three - and - a - half years in office and more gray hair , i have a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by the men before me , including president @entity8 , " @entity9 said , adding that one truth is you ca n't make everybody happy			1
" i think that 's something president @entity8 and i learned pretty quickly , " @entity9 continued , later noting that " we may have our differences politically , but the presidency transcends those differences			1
" both @entity8 and mrs. @entity71 , who also had her official portrait unveiled , thanked the @entity73 for their hospitality in hosting the event that included lunch with the @entity8 family -- including both former presidents and first ladies as well as former first daughters @entity80 and @entity82			2
they also made a point of thanking the @entity10 and administration staff during their eight years in @entity0 , and cracked jokes that caused the packed @entity14 to erupt in laughter			0
" thank you so much for inviting our rowdy friends to my hanging , " @entity8 said after shouting " sit down " to cut off a lengthy standing ovation when it was his turn to speak			0
@entity8 quipped that he hoped the president will find reassurance because , when walking the @entity10 halls at night mulling over a major problem , " you 'll now be able to gaze at this portrait and ask ' what would @entity8 do ? ' " mrs. @entity71 also drew a big laugh when she said in reference to the new paintings that " nothing makes a house a home like having portraits of its former occupants staring down at you			2
" in the most emotional moment , @entity8 's voice cracked a little as he said of his father -- the nation 's 41st president -- that he was honored the portrait would be " hanging near a man who gave me the greatest gift possible , unconditional love , and that would be no. 41			0
" when @entity117 rose to speak , she began by saying : " i do n't think we have enough tissue to go around			0
