@entity0 -- @entity2 steadfastly denied monday that he aided terrorists in incidents that span the globe , from a remote @entity7 ranch to the dusty desert of the @entity9			1
he described @entity10 as a hothead , in charge of an unfocused organization that has betrayed the @entity15 people			2
as for the @entity18 regime , it does n't need his money ; it has " millions , " yet does n't feed its own people , he said			2
but in @entity22 , by invoking 9/11 and @entity10 's name , @entity2 mused , " you can convict a person of killing the @entity25			1
" @entity26 testified on direct examination over three days in a federal courtroom less than a mile from the site of ground zero and the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			0
he 's accused of aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage - taking in @entity33 ; facilitating violent jihad in @entity15 ; supplying goods and services to the @entity18 ; and attempting to establish an @entity38 - style training camp on the @entity39 of the @entity40			1
the @entity42 - born cleric testified last week about his path to becoming the high - profile imam of a @entity46 mosque , whose sermons allegedly inspired several notorious terrorists , including 9/11 hijacker @entity49			1
@entity26 said he went to @entity46 as a young man because loved the @entity52 lifestyle , wanted to make money and have fun " @entity40 style , " he smiled			2
he worked as a bouncer and strip - club manager before bits of @entity59 teachings from friends began to penetrate his mind and the hypocrisy of his lifestyle hit him like a slap in the face			0
the defendant broke down twice on the stand describing key moments that helped shape his ideology , like seeing a young @entity71 boy -- maybe 12 -- wearing camouflage and clutching a @entity73 , receive a hug from a grieving mother as thousands of other @entity77 men and boys lay dead in the @entity80 mass graves nearby			2
" i wish i trained my son , " the woman said			0
@entity26 said he left @entity71 with the belief that training in physical jihad -- holy struggle -- even for children is crucial to the defense of @entity77 when governments and outside forces fail to keep them safe			2
he 's seen it from @entity15 to @entity92 , he said : " the @entity39 will not do the job			0
" the government 's three - week case against @entity2 was an effort to connect the dots between the defendant and events thousands of miles away through key witnesses who often never met the cleric themselves , and are testifying as government informants in exchange for leniency or protection			1
the pivotal government prosecution witness was @entity108 , a @entity109 man who conceived the idea for a pay - as - you - go jihad training camp on a large patch of barren land outside @entity115 , @entity7 , in 1999			1
he faxed a sales pitch to @entity2 from a local @entity117 , he said on the stand			1
" it looks just like @entity15 , " @entity108 wrote to the prominent preacher , asking for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from @entity46 so fighters could be readied for the @entity15 front lines			0
two men were allegedly sent by @entity2 to aid with the effort , carrying cash and training materials , but left once they realized @entity108 's promises were empty , according to testimony			1
@entity26 said on the stand monday that he scanned only the first few lines of the fax before tossing it in the trash and considered it a " hallucination			0
" unbeknownst to him , he said , the paper was fished out of the garbage by @entity142 , a @entity144 - born @entity143 citizen who lived at the defendant 's @entity46 mosque periodically and was eager to make a name for himself			1
@entity142 decided to pursue the idea of a camp without @entity2 's knowledge while trading on the prominent cleric 's name , the defense claims			1
@entity142 was convicted in 2009 on 11 terrorism - related counts relating to the @entity7 facility and operating terrorist websites , according to the @entity158			1
prosecutors also allege that @entity2 sent @entity108 to @entity15 in 1999 to deliver envelopes of cash and a young recruit for the front lines			0
@entity26 maintained on the stand that he in fact had tried to talk the young man out of traveling to @entity15 to fight , and that he still does not know whether @entity108 actually brought him along			0
he scoffed at the thought he 'd use @entity108 -- a " troublemaker " and known liar who had never set foot in @entity15 -- for such an errand , when any of the several dozen @entity15 veterans in the mosque would have provided more reliable options			0
he conceded he gave @entity176 money to transport but said it was charity for a secret girls ' school and widows of mujahedeen fighters , not the @entity18 regime or @entity38 -- something @entity108 's testimony corroborated			0
@entity108 admitted on the stand that his past is marred by a range of criminal endeavors , including picking up knock - off watches in @entity0 and passing them off as expensive brand originals ; selling a stolen laptop during an airport bathroom rendezvous ; and evading prosecution by fleeing to @entity196			0
he spent approximately six years in prison for his role in the defendant 's alleged crimes and testified as part of a deal with the government that allowed for a significant reduction in jail time			0
federal prosecutors have also alleged that @entity2 aided kidnappers of a large tour group in @entity33 in 1998 and called to the stand two survivors of the harrowing hostage drama that left four of their fellow travelers dead			1
while @entity2 conceded on the stand he supplied the satellite phone used by the hostage takers , he said the group 's only plan that he knew of was to topple the @entity33 government			1
he 'd been asked to act as the group 's spokesperson some five months before the incident , he said , and bought the phone in his own name , because as a spokesperson in a politically charged climate " you ca n't afford to do anything but what 's legal , transparent			0
" when he learned of the kidnapping , he felt " betrayed because of ignorance , " he testified , and immediately issued a public statement to defuse the situation and discourage a disastrous , knee - jerk response by @entity33 authorities			2
in his only telephone contact with the kidnappers during the event , he urged them to let the hostages call their respective embassies and even called the satellite phone salesman to purchase 500 @entity241 pounds ' worth of pre-paid minutes for that purpose , he testified			1
asked what philosophy guides him as a cleric , @entity2 said he tries to defuse violent conflict with his impassioned sermons : " the harshest of all talks is better than the easiest of all wars			2
" assistant u.s. attorney @entity251 will begin his cross examination of @entity2 tuesday morning .			0
