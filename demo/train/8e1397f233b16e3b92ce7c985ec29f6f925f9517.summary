-- @entity3 novelist @entity2 's first film as writer - director was inspired by a dream she had			2
or maybe it was a nightmare ? judging by the movie , it could have been a bit of both			0
@entity11 -- the doll - like child actress from " @entity12 " who graduated to the status of action - babe in " @entity15 " earlier this year -- plays @entity16 , a college student who takes on a series of menial jobs over the course of the film , including waitress , lab rat , secretary and sex toy			1
in the brilliantly creepy first scene , she somehow refrains from retching as a lab researcher threads several feet of tubing down her throat			0
it 's a strong indication that whatever else , @entity16 has the willpower to dissociate mind from body -- to mentally switch off			1
this remains her defining characteristic throughout : a kind of abstention that serves her well in trying circumstances , but which also makes @entity16 a frustratingly vague , ill - defined personality			1
with her pale skin and wide eyes , @entity11 has a particular @entity43 beauty that 's oddly impassive			1
it 's as if she 's sleepwalking through the story -- or , perhaps , this is her own erotic / masochistic dream ? interviewed for another position by the immaculately coiffed and polished @entity48 ( a chilly , regal @entity49 ) , @entity16 uncomplainingly strips down to her undies for an intimate physical inspection			1
@entity48 apparently likes what she sees , and next thing you know @entity16 is serving champagne to a dinner table of aristocrats who get their kicks by ignoring the near - naked servants			2
this proves to be something of an audition for a better - paid gig at @entity48 's country mansion , where rich old men pay handsomely for a night with a beautiful young girl			0
house rules permit anything short of actual penetration or physical harm			0
meanwhile the girl is so heavily drugged she sleeps through the entire experience			0
where 's the fun in that , you might think ? is @entity2 delving into the murky waters of female sexuality , or making a political point about exploitation and prostitution ? again , the movie seems to want to do both , though it does n't go far enough down either route to reach any firm conclusions			1
sticking with a mostly static camera and lengthy takes , @entity2 seems to be shooting for the kind of slow , somber surrealism of @entity90 's foray into similar subject matter , " @entity92 "			2
but she 's not that accomplished a director -- not yet , anyway -- and the film sometimes drifts into a stilted somnolence			0
scenes of @entity16 's everyday life away from work -- bickering with flat - mates , or caring for a dying friend -- fail to shed much light on the character or her motivations , and are shot in the same monotonous rhythm			1
more effective are the quietly ugly , anti-erotic chamber pieces : the one - sided encounters between the slumbering @entity16 and the aging , all - but impotent clients			2
these scenes are emotionally and visually frank , shedding a hard , cold light on what men want from the opposite sex			0
in the end , there 's enough here to make us see why @entity2 felt compelled to turn her dream into a movie , even if this suggestive , frustratingly elusive effort is not an entirely pleasurable experience for the rest of us .			0
