-- @entity1 had promised there would be a time where the world would finally see a special player			1
he wears a yellow shirt emblazoned with the number 10 and produces moments of magic which mere mortals can scarcely dream of replicating -- unless on their games console			0
he 's 22 years of age -- a player with quick feet , a mind which sees each and every move before his opponents have drawn breath , a player who can score a goal when for all the world it appears impossible			0
what @entity1 did n't promise is that he would wear the yellow of @entity26 -- and his name is @entity28			1
while @entity29 might be the face of this @entity31 , @entity28 is the man that football fans have fallen for			1
his two strikes propelled @entity26 to a 2 - 0 victory over @entity35 and into its first ever @entity31 quarterfinal where it will play @entity1 and made him top scorer in the tournament with five goals			1
it promises to be some occasion in @entity42 where the two 22 - year - old stars will take to the same field -- but if @entity28 reproduces this performance , @entity1 will surely be heading out			1
in @entity26 , they call him " @entity28 " -- the @entity48 -- the man who takes on the mantle of former @entity52 great @entity51			1
@entity51 , known as " @entity51 " is widely acknowledged as the greatest @entity52 to have kicked a ball -- though even he expects that to change			0
this contest was an example of the new kid rising to the top			0
sometimes you witness something so special that it 's difficult to imagine quite how it came to pass			0
perhaps on friday night , @entity28 went to sleep and dreamed of how he 'd score the perfect @entity31 goal			1
but even then , as the moon looked down upon @entity65 , it is doubtful that @entity28 would have envisaged scoring a goal so perfect that it will no doubt be played over and over for years to come			1
make no mistake -- @entity28 's volleyed strike , which would have caused a gasp and a sharp intake of breath from those watching around the world , was a moment never to be forgotten			2
that will be clear once kids across @entity26 , @entity1 and indeed across the world , begin trying to recreate the goal scored by football 's latest sensation			1
it would be wrong to call @entity28 a new star -- he moved to @entity84 club @entity82 from @entity85 last year for around $ 65 million			2
but his emergence on the international stage has captured the imagination of those who have yet to witness the talented playmaker in action			0
his two goals helped secure @entity26 's place in friday 's quarterfinal against a @entity1 side which sneaked past @entity97 courtesy of a penalty shootout victory			1
while it may be the host nation , @entity1 will surely feel more pressure and anxiety at the thought of facing this @entity26 team -- a side which plays with a style and swagger which @entity107 's men have so far lacked			1
that everyone who walked out of the @entity109 after the game was speaking about @entity28 was a testament to the player but also ensured another star name was temporarily forgotten at least			2
after all , much of the lead up to the game had focused on one man -- a man who was nowhere to be seen			0
@entity117 , banned for four months from all football and suspended for nine international games following his bite on @entity122 's @entity121 , may have been absent from the @entity109 , but his shadow loomed large			0
@entity35 's players gathered in the dressing room to take photos of themselves holding his shirt , while the entire country has remained defiant in the defense of its hero			1
@entity131 confirmed to @entity0 that the @entity132 will appeal @entity117 's ban -- but he will certainly take no further part in this @entity31			2
instead , back at home in @entity35 , he could only watch on as his teammates were brushed aside by a vibrant , exciting and hugely talented @entity52 side			2
@entity26 , playing in its first @entity31 since 1998 , has produced some of the most eye - catching football witnessed so far -- an impressive feat given the absence of @entity144 , the team 's star striker			1
led by @entity28 , this is a team which oozes flair , adventure and style while still ensuring the backdoor remains slammed firmly shut			2
the @entity82 playmaker had already scored in each of the three group games -- but none of those goals match the finish he produced to give his side a 28th minute lead			0
when the ball popped up to him , some 20 - yards from goal , most would have expected @entity28 to control the ball , take it down , and possibly have an effort on goal			2
what nobody expected , nor thought possible was what happened next			0
@entity28 took the ball on his chest , allowed the ball to drop , and then unleashed a volley which flew past @entity170 in the @entity35 goal , hit the underside of the crossbar , and nestled in the back of the net			1
it was thing of beauty -- a goal which took the breath away			0
as @entity28 ran away to celebrate with what has become an almost traditional dance , @entity35 appeared stunned by what had just occurred			1
with its own talisman missing , it was @entity26 's which began to dictate the game			2
@entity28 , appearing at his first @entity31 , plays with a poise and experience which belies his years			1
each and every time the ball arrives at his feet there is a buzz , a hum , around the stadium which greets the way he controls the ball , whenever he shifts it right , moves it left , or finds a teammate			0
but it 's not all about @entity28			2
@entity201 , who led @entity202 to the quarterfinals in 2006 where it was beaten by @entity205 , has molded together a team which thrills and excites each time it takes the field			0
its second goal was a case in point -- a wonderful team move which led to @entity28 slotting the ball home from close range after @entity218 had headed the ball back across goal			0
that goal , which arrived five minutes after the interval , killed off any hopes @entity35 might have had of launching a comeback			0
it briefly rallied late on with @entity226 in the @entity26 goal forced to make saves from @entity229 and @entity230 , but its late pressure proved futile			0
instead , @entity35 's players will fly home where @entity117 will no doubt be waiting for them and wondering what might have had happened had he been able to play			0
but for all the talk of absent stars , it was the name of a new one which will undoubtedly be the new focus of this @entity31			1
he plays in yellow and he produces moments of magic which bring football fans to their feet			0
he 's not @entity29 though -- no. he 's @entity28 -- and he 's coming for @entity1 .			1
