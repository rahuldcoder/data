-- i was born in @entity2 , raised in @entity3 and @entity4 , and ended up in @entity5 , @entity6			1
coming to @entity7 from @entity2 , a place where black and white were only colors that had little to do with race , i had to learn @entity11 , and also the language of identity			1
in @entity7 , i was black			1
so when some online commenters questioned whether @entity17 winner and @entity18 - @entity7 @entity16 is truly " @entity7 , " it reminded me of my own experience as an immigrant who became a naturalized @entity7 citizen and embraced a new identity			1
my parents , two brothers and i had an incredible life in @entity2			1
we always had the newest toys and clothes from my father 's frequent work - related trips abroad			2
there were lots of friends and just as much family			2
life was very communal , much like our style of eating			2
of course , @entity2 was not perfect , but it was all that i knew			1
my well - traveled parents wanted to grant my brothers and i the opportunities that @entity7 offered			1
movies shaped my brothers ' and my perception of @entity7			1
as far as i was concerned , everyone lived in massive homes , owned multiple cars and was generally happier			2
the movie " @entity48 " stunned me the most			2
the images of homeless people and the rundown apartment occupied by the characters played by @entity53 and @entity54 contradicted the @entity7 of my imagination			1
in the weeks before leaving @entity2 , my older brother @entity56 and i used to stay up late talking about how a group of welcoming @entity7 friends , a brand new @entity7 car and a huge @entity7 house would soon be ours			1
but landing in @entity63 , our expectations soon dissipated			2
from the thick , humid air that permeates @entity3 in august to the instant feeling of being an outsider , we began to breathe less easy			2
in my fourth grade class , my peers were not as curious about me as i was about them			0
they avoided me and teased me for being @entity69			0
i mostly attributed my peers ' distaste for me to my country of origin , until the day my older brother @entity56 came home from school after getting into a fight with a boy			0
the boy had called him a " nigger			0
" i soon realized it was n't just because of our funny accents or nationality that people treated us differently			0
in @entity7 , we were seen as " black			1
" i became painfully aware of my brown skin , my unruly hair , and the disapproving looks directed my way			0
and so my introduction to @entity7 culture began			1
by the time my family moved to @entity4 , the outsized expectations of @entity7 were a distant memory			1
i felt i had a better grasp of @entity7 culture and my new black identity			1
my @entity98 was fluent , without a trace of an accent ; it allowed me to socialize with less reluctance			0
i quickly made friends at my junior high school and became involved in extracurricular activities			0
i found comfort in having friends that looked like me			0
by the time i was a teenager , working weekends serving meals at a retirement home , i learned the difference between subtle and overt racism			0
there was a man there who refused to speak to me , let me take his order , or even look me in the eyes because i was black			1
it was understood that only my white co-workers would interact with him			0
the people i was close to would praise me by saying how well my parents raised me , and told me : " you 're not like the rest of them			0
" i almost thought that they said these things as a compliment			0
but i understood they were making an exception for me , in order to maintain their bigoted views of black and brown people			2
because i defied the scope of their prejudice , i had to be unique			0
i tried to take off - the - cuff comments from the elderly with a grain of salt			0
after all , they are from a different time period , when those sentiments were expected and accepted			0
but it was when i heard my peers say , " you 're not really black			2
you do n't even act black , " that i realized just how much the perceived singularity of the black identity transcends generations , age and gender			1
this made me embrace my " blackness " more passionately , and i began to identify more as " black " than @entity2			1
i was n't quite @entity2 enough for some of my @entity2 friends who were convinced moving to the @entity7 at such a young age caused me to lose some legitimacy			1
my vivid memories of @entity2 and ability to speak my native language did n't cement my " @entity2 - ness " to some			1
and i did not live up to my @entity7 peers ' expectations of being @entity166 either , even after becoming a naturalized citizen			1
so there i was , the president of the @entity169 , a member of the @entity171 , and the founder of @entity173 at @entity174			0
i became quite the skilled juggler			0
tired of the balancing act , i began to care less and less about others ' perceptions of me			0
eventually , i became proud of not fitting neatly into someone else 's definition of being black or @entity2			1
when i moved to @entity6 , i felt at home , and met people with a similar understanding of black identity -- one that was varied and nuanced			1
they were more interested in having conversations about my experiences , and less interested in my color			0
i no longer felt the weight of defending all of the different aspects of my identity to everyone			2
but there is one thing about the black identity that remains constant : the complexities of the individual experiences that inform our identity			1
yes , i am black			2
i am also a journalist , a filmmaker , a sister , a daughter , a friend , an avid traveler and a woman who is constantly growing and evolving			0
there is no doubt that my experiences , at times turbulent , have contributed to my racial identity			2
but my identity is never static			2
instead , it remains fluid			0
the reality is that my story is not singular simply because i was born abroad			0
it is distinctive in the way that each of us , as individuals , is distinct			0
and so are our identities			0
so when people say i am not " really black " or that @entity16 is not " really @entity7 , " i 'd invite them to run a mile in each of our shoes -- to see what we 've gone through to become as uniquely @entity7 as anyone .			1

some have said @entity17 winner @entity16 is not truly @entity7
@entity231 **writes** that she faced similar questions of her identity when she arrived from @entity2
