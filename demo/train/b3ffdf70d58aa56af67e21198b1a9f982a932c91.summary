-- a person who is brain dead may appear alive -- there may be a heartbeat , they may look like they 're breathing , their skin may still be warm to the touch			1
but doctors say there is no life when brain activity ceases			2
doctors in @entity15 , @entity16 , declared 13 - year - old @entity17 to be brain dead on december 12 , three days after she underwent a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy			1
the @entity17 family fought in court to keep the teen on a ventilator , and announced monday that they had moved the girl to another care facility			2
while family attorney @entity31 told reporters that for her safety , @entity17 's destination wo n't be announced , a @entity30 facility said sunday it was ready to accept her			2
" we are aware of @entity17 's dire situation , and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24 - hour care , " said @entity37 , founder of @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity30			2
" her brain needs time to heal			2
" " this child has been defined as a deceased person yet she has all the functional attributes of a living person despite her brain injury , " the center said on its website			2
when routine surgeries go wrong however , barring a misdiagnosis , medical experts say the teen will not recover if she is truly " brain dead			1
" while laymen tend to use the words " coma " and " brain dead " interchangeably , in medicine they mean very different things			1
" @entity66 " is the broader term used to describe a prolonged state of unconsciousness , according to the @entity65			2
outwardly , it resembles sleep			0
doctors may sometimes purposefully put a patient into a coma to give the brain time to heal			1
@entity66 rarely last longer than a couple of weeks , according to the clinic ; patients can fully regain consciousness or may transition from a coma into a persistent vegetative state			1
someone in a persistent vegetative state has lost most higher cognitive function , but his or her brain shows some activity			1
the patient may open their eyes or exhibit small movements , but can not speak or respond to commands , according to the @entity89			0
some patients can recover from this state , according to the @entity89			0
both these situations are different from brain death : according to the @entity95 , an individual is dead when he or she " has sustained either ( 1 ) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions , or ( 2 ) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain , including the brain stem			1
" what that essentially means is that the brain , an extremely complex organ , no longer helps the patient function			0
the human brain is divided into what doctors call the @entity112 and the @entity113			2
the @entity112 -- where the top of the spinal cord goes up through our necks and into our brains -- regulates body functions such as spontaneous breath , reflexes , our heartbeat , body temperature and sleep / wake cycles			0
the @entity113 is behind all the " higher " functions in a person 's nervous system			0
this gives us the ability to use our senses -- to see , taste , smell , hear and feel			0
" brain death " means both the upper and lower part of the brain are not functioning			1
that command center of the body that regulates the central nervous system is unable to perform			0
however , some function , such as a heartbeat , may linger			0
" it 's a little difficult for a layperson to understand how a person is dead if the heart is still beating , " said dr. @entity141 , director of the neurosciences intensive care service at @entity145 's @entity144			0
but without brain function , the body eventually shuts down , unless there is medical intervention			0
someone on a ventilator may appear to be breathing , but can not breathe on their own			0
while the heart usually stops within 72 hours , it could continue beating for " a week or so , " @entity141 said			0
@entity17 's mother , @entity161 , has said , " i would probably need for my child 's heart to stop to show me that she was dead			1
her heart is still beating , so there 's still life there			0
" the term " brain dead " can be misleading , said @entity171 , professor of clinical ethics at @entity173 , because it sounds like a person really is n't dead			1
if someone dies of a heart attack , doctors do n't say they 're " cardiovascular dead , " for example			2
doctors should be more transparent about the finality of brain death , said @entity182 , director of the @entity183 at @entity184			1
terms such as " mechanical support " or " artificial machine support " should be used to refer to sustaining the functioning of a brain dead person , he said			1
" no one wants to take away ' life support			0
' " " dead is dead , " agreed neurologist dr. @entity192 in the @entity193			0
" brain death is n't a different type of death , and patients who meet the criteria of brain death are legally dead			1
" the @entity201 updated its brain death guidelines for adults in 2010 , asking doctors to follow a step - by - step checklist of some 25 tests			1
all criteria in the guidelines must be met before a person can be considered brain dead ; however , the legal definition of brain death can vary from state to state			1
the @entity214 added to those guidelines for children			0
these childrens ' guidelines advise there should be two attending physicians involved in the care of the child , and they should make separate examinations separated by an observation period			0
both must determine the child is brain dead			1
in making that ruling , the doctors use the currently established criteria ; there must not be a conflict of interest			2
" no one who has met the criteria for brain death has ever survived , " @entity192 said			1
" @entity0 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0

doctors declared @entity17 , 13 , brain dead on december 12
brain dead is different from a persistent vegetative state or coma
" no one who has met the criteria for brain death has ever survived , " expert says
