-- @entity2 banking giant @entity1 is changing the way it pays out bonuses to its 6,000 highest earners to limit the firm 's exposure to risk and loss			1
the rule change comes as the @entity12 - based bank reported a huge fourth quarter loss to shareholders of $ 2.1 billion			0
a large portion of that stemmed from a december 2012 agreement to pay $ 1.5 billion in fines over a scandal to manipulate @entity20 , the rate banks use when borrowing money from one another			0
under the new compensation model , @entity1 will dole out a larger portion of annual bonuses in the form of bonds instead of cash			1
such instruments would be fully paid out over a number of years and only if there are no major financial issues for the bank , such as the need for a bailout or if its common equity ratio falls below 7 % , @entity1 says			1
if such events happen , the value of those bonds would be wiped out , essentially erasing a portion of employee bonuses			2
in a press release , @entity1 said " the changes focus @entity1 's employees on medium - and longer - term performance , provide them with the opportunity to benefit from the firms longer term success , and simplify @entity1 's compensation framework , making it more transparent			2
" the move signals a shift in the politically - charged issue of bank bonuses			1
many financial institutions that received government bailouts during the financial crisis were contractually obligated to continue to pay out bonuses , which raised taxpayer ire			0
for bank executives , the change may spur them to make less risky trades or to search for a new job at a firm with less stringent bonus pay rules , analysts say .			0

@entity1 *unveils* compensation model allowing bank to claw back bonuses more easily
@entity72 will pay out larger portion of bonuses in form of bonds , instead of cash
@entity79 values to be wiped out if bank needs bailout or if equity ratio falls below *minimum*
change in bonus payout model is shift in politically - charged issue of banker bonuses
