@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 has said that a rape victim freed from prison after he intervened on her behalf has the right to make her own choice about whether to marry her attacker			1
in an exclusive interview from @entity0 , @entity2 told @entity1 's @entity12 that the woman 's case appeared to be a " misjudgment " that had to be resolved			1
the woman , identified only as @entity17 for her own protection , was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she reported that her cousin 's husband had raped her			1
but the 21 - year - old was freed this week following the president 's intervention , and is now staying at a women 's shelter in @entity0 , with the daughter she conceived in the attack and gave birth to in prison			1
her plight attracted international attention when it came out that she had agreed to marry her attacker to gain her freedom and legitimize her daughter			2
@entity2 said he had convened a judicial meeting when he came aware of her case			1
" the issue was discussed in detail , and the right inquiries made			0
we , on advice from the chief justice and the minister of justice , decided that this was a case , perhaps , of misjudgment and that it has to be resolved , and resolved by giving her a pardon immediately			2
that 's what i did			0
" asked whether it was appropriate that @entity17 should marry her attacker , as some in @entity3 say , @entity2 said it was her choice			1
" it 's up to her to decide who to marry or who not to marry , " he said			1
" and @entity60 gives her that right			0
" looking to the future , @entity2 said the @entity64 should have confidence in @entity3 's judicial processes after international forces withdraw			1
" it 's a country that has been troubled a lot			0
but it is also an old country , with laws and a penal code and judicial history , " he said			0
" i can assure you that , once the international forces are withdrawn and not as many as there are today , @entity3 will neither go into a trouble within the country or strife or into miscarriage of justice			0
i can assure you of that			0
" after the attack two years ago , @entity17 hid what happened as long as she could because she was afraid of reprisals			1
but then she began showing signs of pregnancy and , aged only 19 , was found guilty by the courts of sex outside of marriage -- adultery -- and sentenced to 12 years in jail			0
a key problem is that @entity3 law fails to clearly distinguish between rape and adultery , which is a crime under @entity97 , or @entity60 law			0
and despite the pardon , @entity17 's future remains unclear in a conservative society where her ordeal is considered to have brought shame on her family			2
she told @entity1 from prison last month that she was willing to marry her attacker in order to end her incarceration , though she did not want that option			0
@entity2 also discusses @entity3 's future relationship with the @entity111 and his country 's efforts to deal with the @entity114 in the exclusive interview , to be broadcast sunday on @entity116 .			2

@entity2 : " it 's up to her to decide who to marry or who not to marry "
his intervention led to a rape victim who was jailed for adultery over the attack being freed
@entity2 says her case appeared to be a " misjudgment "
@entity17 , 21 , is now staying at a women 's shelter with her daughter , conceived in the attack
