-- when @entity3 's first democratically elected president was tossed out this year , the @entity1 stopped short of calling it a coup			1
doing so would have forced an end to the $ 1.23 billion that the @entity7 sends in military aid a year -- and changed the course of its relationship with its strongest @entity13 ally in the region			1
but that was before wednesday , when the military - led interim government stormed two camps full of former president @entity19 's supporters			2
more than 525 people were killed and 3,717 wounded in the bloodiest day in @entity3 's recent history , officials there said			2
on thursday , president @entity24 condemned the violence against civilians and announced the @entity7 is canceling next month 's joint @entity7 - @entity3 military exercises			1
but will the carnage in @entity3 spur more changes in @entity7 policy toward the most populous @entity13 country ? and might the hardening @entity7 stance affect @entity3 's own approach ? the short answer : we 'll have to wait and see			1
@entity37 's desperate text to daughter killed in @entity3 ' a hornets ' nest ' the @entity7 helps @entity3 in part because it 's one of only two @entity13 countries -- along with @entity43 -- that made peace with @entity45			1
in return , @entity3 gets more than $ 1 billion each year in @entity7 taxpayer money for military and civilian programs			1
no other country except @entity45 gets more			2
that aid buys @entity51 an ally to depend on in a turbulent region			0
the @entity7 does n't want to upset that balance			2
and pulling aid might do so			0
" it 's a hornets ' nest			0
and that 's why the administration is trying not to stir it too much , " @entity0 's @entity57 said			0
what experts say about the bloodshed in @entity63 give up some to get some but it 's not just the peace process and regional stability that the @entity7 is interested in			1
@entity3 controls the @entity67 , a crucial sea route used by more than 4 % of the world 's oil traffic and 8 % of all seaborne trade			1
so far , the canal is running smoothly			0
but a disruption there could end up hitting @entity7 in the pocketbook , not to mention affect the safe passage of @entity7 military ships and equipment			1
then there 's business for @entity7 companies , intelligence cooperation -- and the military relationship			1
" the reality is that the @entity3 military has not only been a source of stability for the @entity7 in an otherwise turbulent @entity90 , but it has also been a cash cow , " said @entity84 , a senior fellow at the @entity85			1
" currently , the @entity3 military relies on @entity7 military equipment , training and services			1
this reliance means that @entity3 is essentially a client of the @entity7 military complex , and aid money is in fact re-injected back into the @entity7 economy			1
" @entity101 urges @entity3 to show restraint all of the factors are enough to give the @entity7 pause			1
" we need to have a discussion about the costs and benefits of different relationships with the @entity3 , and the @entity3 need to have the same about their relationship with us , " said @entity105 , director of the @entity106 at the @entity107			2
" if you want a different relationship , you have to articulate what that looks like , and accept you are going to have to give up some things to get other things			0
" ' a really tough dilemma ' from the @entity24 administration 's side , it 's an " incredibly complex and difficult situation " that will require more time to figure out			2
that 's what @entity1 spokesman @entity125 said in july soon after @entity19 was ousted , and reporters pressed him as to why the administration was n't calling it a coup			0
" it would not be in the best interests of the @entity7 to immediately change our assistance programs " to @entity3 , @entity125 said at the time			1
@entity90 analyst @entity135 with the @entity136 says the core issue is what our policy ought to be			0
" the @entity7 faces a really tough dilemma now , " she said			2
" what to do about the most important country in the @entity13 world , the cornerstone of the peace process , a country that has received over $ 30 billion in @entity7 aid since the peace process began in the late 1970s			1
" cameraman killed in @entity63 violence calls mounting some in @entity152 , including @entity154 sen. @entity153 of @entity155 , already have called for halting the aid , saying the @entity7 " should not be supporting this coup			1
" @entity153 traveled to @entity3 on august 5 along with sen. @entity158 of @entity159			2
both held meetings with representatives of the interim government and the @entity164			0
@entity166 sen. @entity165 of @entity167 , chairman of the @entity169 , has said the @entity7 has n't committed much of this year 's aid -- and that 's a good thing			1
" this is an opportunity to have a pause and say to the @entity3 , ' you have an opportunity to come together , ' " he said			0
" you have to have the military understand that that 's what we 're looking for , a transition right away , as soon as possible			0
" three choices according to senior @entity7 officials last month , the administration is examining three potential options : -- call it a coup and cut off aid			2
-- call it a coup and issue a national security waiver to allow aid to continue			0
-- do n't call it a coup because the @entity3 military has taken steps to move the country toward a civilian transitional government and subsequent elections			2
now , officials -- both current and former -- recognize the climate is not encouraging			0
' time to call it a coup ' " i think it is time to call it a coup			0
i think it was time six weeks ago , " former assistant secretary of state @entity206 said wednesday			0
" suspend military assistance so the military is invested in the process of rewriting the constitution , setting the parliament and electing a new president			0
" secretary of state @entity214 said wednesday that while a political solution is still possible , " it has been made much , much harder , much more complicated			0
" " the path toward violence leads only to greater instability , economic disaster and suffering , " @entity214 said he also called for an end to @entity3 's new state of emergency , which prevents freedom of peaceful assembly and due process			0
the @entity3 raid , at a glance @entity7 still considering its strategy but as far as firm actions , the @entity7 ' game plan has yet to be drawn			1
the @entity231 is mulling whether to halt or delay arms exports			0
but as leaders in @entity51 mull their options , @entity7 overwhelmingly support staying out of the unrest , according to a recent @entity237 / @entity236			0
almost eight in 10 @entity7 ( 78 % ) said the @entity7 should " mostly stay out of events " in @entity3 , according to the poll			1
but 16 % said the @entity7 should " do more " to end the violence			0
the desire to stay out of @entity3 's affairs might be connected to the fact that a majority of @entity7 feel what happens in the country is n't very important to @entity7 interests			1
according to a @entity249 poll , 61 % of @entity7 say what happens in @entity3 is somewhat important or not important , while 36 % say it is very important			1
but ultimately , it 's up to @entity3 to find a peaceful resolution between the military - backed interim government and those who want @entity19 back			2
" the role the @entity7 had tried to play as mediator between the military and the @entity164 to try to find some kind of compromise is now moot , " said @entity255 , the @entity90 analyst			2
" there 's not much the @entity7 can do			0
" @entity0 's @entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
