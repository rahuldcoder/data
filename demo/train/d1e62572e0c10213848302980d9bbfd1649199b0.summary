-- when the lights went out during the magic show , the @entity2 passengers watching thought it was part of the act			1
then there was a scraping sound , the ship began to list to one side and a panicked evacuation began			0
one year ago , on january 13 , 2012 , the @entity2 struck rocks and turned on its side off the @entity16 island of @entity17 , killing 32 people and shaking an industry that prefers to be known for fun in the sun and endless entertainment			1
capt. @entity23 may be indicted in the next few weeks on charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship before his passengers , and other @entity23 executives and crewmembers may also face trial			0
the ship is still in the water			0
salvage experts hope to float the ship by the end of summer 2013 and eventually tow it to an undetermined port for salvage			0
since the disaster , safety policies have been reviewed and changes made to make cruise travel safer			2
to find out what changes passengers can see aboard ship , @entity0 interviewed @entity48 editor - in - chief @entity47 , a veteran of more than 200 cruises			1
@entity50 has sailed with all of the world 's top cruise lines and many lesser - known lines			2
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity : how has the cruise industry changed in the wake of the @entity2 disaster ? the primary change , and the most important change , that we 've seen in the wake of the tragic capsizing of @entity2 is a renewed commitment to safety on a global level			1
it 's not that cruising was unsafe before			0
but the idea that something this disastrous actually did happen has made the cruise industry determined never to suffer a repeat			1
the other big change ? this accident was sobering for cruise travelers , many of whom in the past might have tried to skip the muster drill or chat away during the safety instructions			1
@entity48 readers understand , better than before , that while the cruise lines are responsible for safety , they too have a role to play in cruising safely			1
@entity87 , i 've been to 14 muster drills -- on a variety of ships and cruise lines -- and have noticed that people take them much , much more seriously now			1
and on one ship passengers even asked questions			0
i have never seen that before ! what changes do passengers see ? the most important change , and the first improvement to come out of the tragedy , was a new muster rule			2
before , cruise ships could hold the muster , also known as the safety drill , up until 24 hours after sailing ( though to be honest , most did do musters before the ship left port )			1
now , the drills must be completed before sailing			2
this is important because several hundred passengers who 'd boarded @entity2 the day it ran aground had not yet attended a muster -- and so did n't have the information on what to do in case of an emergency when they needed it most			1
is cruising safer now than before the @entity23 incident on january 13 , 2012 ? absolutely			1
there have been 10 initiatives put into place by the industry since the accident that address a range of issues , from limiting bridge access to carrying significantly more life jackets than needed to standardizing , to some extent , the muster drill			1
what should passengers do when they board a ship -- and when they 're at sea ? first and foremost , they need to listen to the ship 's crew members			0
from officers to bartenders and from spa massage therapists to kids ' club counselors , every one of them is required to undergo consistent training via numerous drills , covering issues like evacuation , serious health emergencies and fire			2
if you 've ever stayed onboard while a ship 's in port , you 've probably heard the drills being conducted over the loudspeaker			2
so it 's crucial that passengers know they should follow directions issued by crew			0
also , when passengers first start their cruise , they may not feel like hearing about safety instructions when there 's a holiday waiting to start , but they need to focus and listen at the muster drill			1
beyond that ? relax and have a good time			0
how should passengers go about choosing a safe ship ? is there a @entity173 - type seal of approval from various associations or travel agents ? there is n't one specific place to go for information			0
at the end of 2012 , all of the disparate cruise industry policy - and marketing - related organizations all over the world banded together to issue global safety recommendations and ultimately merged into one cohesive organization under the umbrella of the @entity188			1
@entity188 has been actively working with the cruise industry and safety regulators to come up with a series of new regulations and guidelines , all in response to the tragic @entity2 event			1
separate from @entity188 are government bodies in the @entity198 like the @entity199 , which operates the @entity200 , and the @entity201 , which oversees safety inspections and ensures compliance with the @entity204			2
travelers can reference @entity199 reports by visiting the @entity199 website , and we also have a quick reference guide on @entity48			2
@entity201 incident reports can be found on the @entity201 website			0
how can passengers stay healthy aboard ship ? our top tip for staying healthy on board is always to wash your hands frequently , as you would anywhere where there are a large number of people interacting with one another			0
in addition to hand washing , also be sure to take advantage of hand sanitizer stations throughout the ship			0
for travelers who know they are susceptible to seasickness or worry that they may be , they should come prepared with ginger candies , acupressure wristbands or over-the - counter medicines like @entity235			0
it 's also important to answer health forms honestly prior to boarding the ship			0
if a passenger shares that they 've been feeling ill prior to debarkation , the cruise line can take the appropriate precautions to ensure that the illness is not spread to other passengers -- a benefit to the sick passenger , as well as their fellow passengers .			0
