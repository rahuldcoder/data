-- rumors that @entity2 is preparing major design changes with @entity4 continue to heat up , with new reports suggesting a more muted and flat design aesthetic			1
last october , @entity7 became responsible not only for the look and feel of @entity2 hardware , but also its software			1
by most accounts , @entity7 is not a fan of the skeuomorphic heavy design cues that currently dominate @entity4			2
while we previously heard rumors that @entity7 was planning a broad @entity17 ( user interface ) overhaul with @entity4 , we did n't have many specific details			2
now , 9to5 @entity21 is reporting that @entity7 's look for @entity4 will be " black , white and flat all over			1
" according to 9to5 @entity21 's sources , many of the textures currently present in @entity26 â € ” linen on the notifications panel and leather in the calendar app â € ” will be replaced with flat black and white colors			1
as for the home screen , apps will no longer have gloss , shadows and shine applied to the icons , but their corners will remain rounded			0
9to5 @entity21 also suggests that apps such as @entity40 will gain a more unified look			1
the report suggests that all apps will share a similar white base each with its own unique color scheme			2
the green felt from @entity46 and the wooden shelves from @entity48 have also reportedly been removed			0
these moves coalesce with more general trends we 've seen in the last 12 to 18 months in mobile and web design			0
in fact , we 've seen concept videos from fans that mirror many of the rumored changes headed towards @entity4			0
@entity2 is expected to unveil the new @entity4 at @entity61 , its developers conference that kicks off june 10			1
the big challenge with an @entity4 overhaul , of course , will be balancing the need for something new with the familiarity the system has with hundreds of millions of users			0
