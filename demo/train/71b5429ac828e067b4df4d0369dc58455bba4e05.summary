" i think it 's a big deal for anybody , " said @entity23 , wellness director at @entity24 & @entity25 and one of the coaches for @entity5 's 30 - kid triathlon team			1
" when you say to someone , ' i want you to swim , bike and run in one event , ' adults ' eyes glass over			1

... ' " schools given $ 25,000 to help kids move @entity43 started almost by mistake four years ago in @entity45 , @entity46 , said event director @entity47			1
his wife is a physical therapist who saw a lot of teens getting burned out on their favorite team sport			2
she worried about kids becoming inactive when they did n't end up playing professionally			2

" that 's a sport that just supports lifelong activity			0
people who are 80 can still do triathlons			0
" the organization 's first race was held in @entity45 with 400 kids			1

" today we hear constantly about kids not being active , " said @entity75 , director of strategic partnerships for the @entity77			1

" why it 's so hard for kids to lose weight cheerleaders for the @entity90 and mascot @entity88 revved kids up sunday as they gathered in a sea of yellow swim caps to the sounds of singer @entity96 's " @entity97			1
" " it 's a bit like herding cats , is n't it ? " a harried volunteer muttered as she tried to line the kids up by race number			0
it was easy to identify the mini pros -- kids whose parents had obviously spent hundreds of dollars on triathlon equipment			0
yet beside the fancy road bikes were ones with pink and purple streamers ; @entity114 helmets lay next to ones shaped like dinosaur heads			0
each kid on @entity5 's team was the first in his or her family to complete a triathlon			0
but as the junior group prepared to jump into the pool , @entity5 and her friend @entity122 were more interested in their loose baby teeth than being nervous			0
" see ? it 's ready to come out , " @entity5 said as she wiggled it with her pointed finger			0
the @entity131 team spent seven weeks training			0
three days a week , the group gathered to swim and either bike , run or practice transitions			1
then , on saturdays from 8 to 11 a.m. , they did all three			0

" huffing and puffing , they 'd look at me like , ' you 're kidding			0
' " ' @entity145 ' races to lose 100 pounds scholarships were awarded to those who could n't afford the registration fee , and some of the team 's triathlon equipment was donated , including @entity5 's new bike			1
" i want her to be competitive in life , quite honestly -- not be afraid to compete , " said @entity5 's mother , @entity153 , as she eagerly waited for her daughter to round the last corner on the bike path			1
twenty minutes later , @entity5 ran across the finish line to receive her medal with a big grin			0
" it was long ! " she exclaimed , gulping down water			0
she said she wants to do another race soon , maybe with her dad next time			0
@entity47 said he hopes the events are making a long - term impact on the communities where they 're held			1
