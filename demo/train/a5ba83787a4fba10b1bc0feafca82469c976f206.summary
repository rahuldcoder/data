-- seventy eight years after @entity2 's albatross at @entity3 became golf 's " shot heard around the world " football has its own version , except there was no glory in @entity12 's kick heard all over the globe			1
and it has left another dent in the sport 's battered image			0
when @entity2 holed his second shot , over water at the par - five 15th , it helped him win the @entity22 title and launch the tournament 's global appeal			0
in 1935 , the news of @entity2 's achievement would have traveled far slower than the seconds it took @entity12 's moment of madness to become a social media talking point across the planet			2
@entity34 were trailing in their @entity35 , generally regarded as the third competition in @entity38 soccer , semifinal second leg in @entity40 , with less than 15 minutes remaining			1
the ball went out of play and , when a ball boy took his time retrieving it , @entity12 went to fetch it himself			1
when the boy fell on the ball , the player tried to kick it out from under him and was sent off for violent conduct			1
more astonishing than the incident itself was the debate about whether or not @entity12 had done anything wrong			2
many people tried to defend the @entity56 international			2
let 's quickly put that to bed			0
the 17 - year - old ball boy was a child , a volunteer helping out at a professional football match , and he was kicked by an adult player			1
now , that 's not the same as saying there were no mitigating circumstances because there were			0
the ball boy later admitted he was wasting time and that was clear to see at the time			1
hazard was anxious to resume play with @entity34 's place in the competition under threat			1
he aimed his kick at the ball not the person			2
the teenager is n't a young child and was n't badly injured			0
those are the only reasons why @entity12 is n't facing the same nine - month ban given to @entity84 icon @entity83 who famously launched himself at an abusive fan with a kung fu - style kick in 1995			1
@entity83 's assault was deliberate and intended to harm whereas @entity12 was merely trying to get the ball back			1
however , @entity83 attacked another adult and after severe provocation			0
hazard 's impatience led to him kicking a minor and if the child had been seriously hurt the police would be investigating			2
@entity34 inflamed the situation when the club 's official @entity99 account immediately defended the player , asking " has football gone mad ? " before later removing the tweet and apologizing			1
well , maybe it has but only because mega rich clubs seem to have lost touch with reality and give the impression they do n't need to follow the rules of common decency that the rest of us try to live by			0
what is a shame for the @entity116 team is that any adulation and respect which stemmed from their fairy tale @entity120 triumph last season has disappeared because of the defensive way they have reacted to criticism since then			0
@entity34 's handling of the @entity128 racism case and the accusations aimed at referee @entity130 was poor			2
a possible persecution complex appears to be a culture at the club			0
the @entity128 and @entity135 incidents happened before @entity137 's arrival and yet the new manager has adopted the same mindset			0
when a simple apology and show of humility would have killed the controversy , a complaint about a " @entity142 society " perpetuates the impression that @entity34 will only ever point fingers and never accept blame			0
in this case , good sense did eventually prevail with reports claiming the boy was taken to @entity34 's dressing room , warmly greeted and he exchanged apologies with @entity12			1
@entity157 police have confirmed they are not pursuing the matter .			0

@entity12 sent of on *wednesday* for kicking a ball boy
the @entity34 player was attempting to retrieve the ball from under the ball boy
hazard was given a *straight* red for the kick during a match with @entity40
the @entity56 has since apologized *privately* and *publicly*
