@entity0 -- former vice president @entity2 says documents released monday support his view that harsh interrogation techniques used on terrorism suspects prevented attacks and yielded crucial information about @entity9			1
former vice president @entity2 disagrees with a federal investigation of harsh @entity12 interrogations			1
@entity2 also criticized the @entity15 administration 's decision to ask a federal prosecutor to determine whether @entity18 intelligence agents violated the law in interrogations that some have equated to torture			1
" the documents released monday clearly demonstrated that the individuals subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques provided the bulk of intelligence we gained about @entity9 , " @entity2 said in a written statement			1
" this intelligence saved lives and prevented terrorist attacks			1
" the former vice president spoke after the federal government released hundreds of pages of documents monday related to the @entity12 interrogations of terrorism suspects			1
the government released a 2004 report from the @entity12 inspector general as well as other documents in which the @entity12 described information that it had obtained by interrogating terrorism suspects -- those are the documents to which @entity2 referred in his statement			1
the 2004 inspector general 's report says that in an effort to get the men to talk , @entity18 interrogators threatened a captured @entity9 operative with a power drill and threatened to kill another top captive 's children			1
that 2004 report was released as a result of a lawsuit filed by the @entity57			2
the report also outlines the use of multiple unauthorized interrogation methods on suspected terrorists , including threats , " blowing cigar smoke , employing certain stress positions , the use of a stiff brush on a detainee , and stepping on a detainee 's ankle shackles			0
" interrogators staged mock executions -- which are banned by the @entity73 -- to try to frighten detainees into talking , the report says			0
in one instance , a gun was fired in a room next to the one in which a suspect was being questioned so he would think another prisoner was being killed			0
cia director @entity81 called much of what was in the report " an old story , " and the @entity85 said president @entity15 still prefers " to look forward , not back " when it comes to the treatment of suspected terrorists			0
but attorney general @entity89 has asked a federal prosecutor to examine whether the interrogations violated the law , and the @entity85 said @entity15 will leave any decision on charges to the @entity95			1
and the @entity15 administration announced it would put the @entity97 in charge of a special unit set up to question suspected terrorists under @entity85 oversight			0
@entity2 criticized those changes , saying @entity15 's decision to let the @entity95 " investigate and possibly prosecute @entity12 personnel ... serves as a reminder ... of why so many @entity18 have doubts about this administration 's ability to be responsible for our nation 's security			1
" the former vice president pointed to @entity12 documents , released monday , that say many captured @entity9 suspects provided information that led to the arrest of other terrorism suspects			1
" the activities of the @entity12 in carrying out the policies of the @entity120 administration were directly responsible for defeating all efforts by @entity9 to launch further mass - casualty attacks against the @entity18 , " @entity2 said			1
@entity89 has said the @entity95 would not prosecute intelligence officers that followed legal guidance from the administration " in good faith			0
" but he said monday that after reviewing the inspector general 's report and an internal @entity95 review , he has asked federal prosecutor @entity130 to lead a preliminary investigation into the interrogations featured in the documents			1
@entity130 was appointed in 2008 by @entity89 's predecessor , @entity134 , to investigate the destruction of @entity12 interrogation tapes , and @entity89 's decision broadens his investigation			1
but in a written statement , @entity81 said monday 's report is " in many ways an old story			2
" " the outlines of prior interrogation practices , and many of the details , are public already , " he said			0
" the use of enhanced interrogation techniques , begun when our country was responding to the horrors of september 11th , ended in january			2
for the @entity12 now , the challenge is not the battles of yesterday , but those of today and tomorrow			1
" as the inspector general 's report was coming out , the @entity15 administration announced that it had created a new @entity157 that will handle the questioning of high - level prisoners			0
it will be led by the @entity97 and will be restricted to using techniques outlined in the @entity162 on interrogations , which senior administration officials said provides " adequate and effective means " of questioning			1
" the new policies proposed by the task force will allow us to draw the best personnel from across the government to conduct interrogations that will yield valuable intelligence and strengthen our national security , " @entity89 said in a written statement			2
" there is no tension between strengthening our national security and meeting our commitment to the rule of law , and these new policies will accomplish both			0
" two former @entity12 operatives welcomed that news , telling @entity1 that the spy agency got into the business of questioning prisoners only after @entity9 's attacks on @entity188 and @entity0			1
@entity189 , a former @entity12 agent who served in @entity190 during the @entity18 invasion that followed 9/11 , said questioning prisoners was " a distraction " for the spy agency			1
" i did n't think we should be in the business of doing that , " @entity189 said			0
" later , the @entity97 did end up in that business			0
unfortunately , this has been a problem			0
" and @entity200 , a former @entity12 officer who served in several @entity202 countries , said the @entity97 interrogates people " for a living			2
" " they 're very good at it			0
they 're very good at making sure they do n't cross the boundary lines , " @entity200 said			0
" the @entity12 traditionally has gone out and recruited sources , not through coercion , and you know , it does very well when it does that			2
" according to the inspector general 's report and officials familiar with its contents , the drill and a gun were used to threaten @entity220 , the suspected plotter of the 2000 bombing of the @entity223 , while interrogators told accused september 11 mastermind @entity225 that " if anything else happens in the @entity18 , we 're going to kill your children			2
" in the incident in which a gun was fired in the next room , the report states , " when the guards moved the detainee from the interrogation room , they passed a guard who was dressed as a hooded detainee , lying motionless on the ground , and made to appear as if he had been shot			0
" @entity12 spokesman @entity240 would comment on specifics of the inspector general 's report , but said all the incidents described in it have already been reviewed by prosecutors			2
" the @entity12 in no way endorsed behavior -- no matter how infrequent -- that went beyond formal guidance			2
this has all been looked at			0
... that 's how the system was supposed to work , and that 's how it did work , " @entity240 said			0
a former intelligence official who is familiar with the report said that while it " reaffirmed " the interrogation program , it " also showed some had strayed off center			0
" the official said that when @entity12 leadership found out about the drill incident , they were " angry as hell " and called it " nickel - and - dime foolishness " that was not tolerated			2
the individual who used the drill was pulled from the program and " sharply reprimanded , " the official said			0
the interrogations took place in the @entity12 's secret prisons before 2006 , when then - president @entity120 moved all detainees from such facilities to the @entity278 prison camp in @entity279			1
the @entity120 administration has previously acknowledged that it authorized what it called " enhanced " interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists there , arguing they produced valuable intelligence without violating @entity18 laws banning torture			1
critics say some of the techniques that had been authorized -- such as the use of waterboarding against @entity220 , @entity225 and fellow @entity9 captive @entity292 -- clearly violated international law			0
@entity1 's @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0
