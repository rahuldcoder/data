-- as @entity4 gen. @entity3 chased @entity6 forces across the @entity8 desert , a stray @entity2 fighter crashed in the blistering sands of the @entity11 @entity10 on june 28 , 1942			1
the pilot was never heard from again			0
the damaged @entity13 -- a couple of hundred miles from civilization -- was presumed lost forever			0
in what experts consider nothing short of a miracle , a @entity17 oil company worker recently discovered the plane believed to have been flown by missing flight sgt. @entity23			1
and almost 70 years after the accident , it 's extraordinarily well - preserved			1
the fighter 's " state of preservation is incredible , " @entity6 military historian @entity26 told @entity0			1
" the thing just landed there in the desert and the pilot clearly got out			0
... it is a complete time capsule really ( and ) an exceptionally rare find			0
these things just do n't happen			0
" most of the plane 's fuselage , wings , tail and cockpit instruments remain intact			1
for safety reasons , @entity11 officials have removed its ammunition and guns			1
see additional photos @entity23 's plane -- authorities have not confirmed his identity , though it has been widely reported in @entity6 newspapers -- crashed after the 24 - year - old pilot got lost while trying to fly it from one @entity2 base to another for repairs to its front landing gear , which would n't retract			1
@entity23 , part of the @entity2 's @entity60 , was trying to get the @entity62 - built plane back in fighting condition in the run - up to what would prove to be the pivotal @entity66			1
the young pilot , according to @entity26 , apparently became disoriented during the flight and headed in the wrong direction			0
another @entity2 pilot flying nearby " tried all sorts of things " to get his attention , but @entity23 " bizarrely " ignored a series of warnings , @entity26 said			1
by the time @entity23 realized his mistake , he was too low on fuel to turn around			2
several pieces of evidence at the crash site -- including a parachute believed to have been used as shelter from the sun -- indicate the strong probability @entity23 survived the landing			1
he almost certainly could not , however , survive the blazing @entity10 heat for long			2
@entity23 " would have stayed by the aircraft initially , " @entity26 noted			2
while the plane 's glass valve radio was likely knocked out of commission by the crash , " the parachute gives him shelter and a means to be identified from the air			2
the guy also would have had a little silver signaling mirror to attract passing aircraft and a pistol with a limited number of flares			0
" why would @entity23 leave the wreckage ? " maybe he got desperate when he saw nobody was coming for him , and thought ( the ) only way to survive was to walk out " and look for help , @entity26 speculated			2
@entity2 pilots in @entity8 at that time did n't have much in terms of rations			2
@entity23 's supply would have been very limited , assuming he had food or water at all			1
pilots were " flying with very basic life support systems , " @entity26 said			0
" his chances of survival were not good			0
" as @entity23 's story becomes known , @entity6 authorities are hoping to bring his plane back to the @entity6 and put it on display at the @entity122 in @entity123			1
museum representatives are working with the @entity125 in @entity126 and @entity6 's @entity127 on a possible recovery operation			1
" it 's an incredible story , " said museum spokesman @entity129			0
" it 's a perfect story in so many ways			0
it 's incredible the plane sat there in this untouched part of the world for so long			0
... we 're dedicated to recovering it as fast as we can			0
this would be a fantastic asset			0
