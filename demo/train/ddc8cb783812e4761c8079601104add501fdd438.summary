@entity0 has disabled its password - reset feature after hackers discovered a security hole in the video - chat service that allows almost anyone to change a user 's password and take control of their account			1
@entity0 said " a small number of users " may have been impacted			0
the company is investigating the problem			0
" early this morning we were notified of user concerns surrounding the security of the password reset feature on our website			1
this issue affected some users where multiple @entity0 accounts were registered to the same email address , " @entity0 's @entity20 said in a posting wednesday			2
" we suspended the password reset feature temporarily this morning as a precaution and have made updates to the password reset process today so that it is now working properly , " he added			1
" we are reaching out to a small number of users who may have been impacted to assist as necessary			0
@entity0 is committed to providing a safe and secure communications experience to our users and we apologize for the inconvenience			0
" the issue was posted on a @entity38 forum two months ago , but did not become widely known until it gained traction recently on @entity41 and was confirmed by @entity42 , a tech - news blog			1
to exploit the flaw , all hackers need to know is a victim 's e-mail address tied to his or her @entity0 account			2
they then can use that e-mail address to create a new account , and minus a few steps , use a password - reset token to gain access to the user 's account and lock out its original owner			1
staffers at @entity42 said they reproduced the attack , step - by - step , and managed to access the @entity0 accounts of a writer and an editor ( with their permission ) , using only their e-mail addresses			2
the issue could have exposed @entity0 instant messages and users ' personal details , including date of birth			0
