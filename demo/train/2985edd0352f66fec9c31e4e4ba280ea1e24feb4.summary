-- former world number one @entity1 says she is determined to get back to the top of tennis following her morale - boosting title success in @entity5			1
the 22 - year - old ended her two - year trophy drought on sunday , moving up to 26th in the rankings after beating @entity9 in the final of the event in @entity12			1
" i think i deserve a position at the top and i think i have the ability to win another grand slam , " the @entity14 champion told @entity0 on monday			2
" i am very keen to get back there , and i am putting everything into it			2
i really want it to happen soon			0

" i feel great , " she said			0
" it really means a lot for me because i have put a lot of hard work in			0
i 'm thrilled to have finally won a title again			1
" after claiming the prestigious number one ranking back in 2008 -- the same year she won her one and only grand slam title to date in @entity38 -- @entity1 found herself quickly slipping outside of the world 's top 20			1
critics were quick to blame a lack of focus , claiming she had been distracted by off - court matters as she signed some lucrative endorsement deals and was courted by media enchanted by her good looks			2
but the @entity49 - born athlete denies any claims that her slump was due to a problem with motivation or a declining interest in the sport she began playing at the age of five			2
" once i became number one i started working even harder			0
i changed my technique but injuries started creeping in -- it was a big mistake as i was doing something right to get to that spot in the first place , " she said			0
" i had a few little injuries and then i lost matches i should have won			0
it affects your confidence -- it 's like a circle that is hard to break			0
" @entity1 's previous @entity25 victory had been on the same @entity5 hard - courts at her peak in 2008 , and she now hopes sunday 's breakthrough can be the catalyst to further success in her still - young career			1
" i am working very hard			0
i know it 's going to be a process , but i am ready to give it my all and come back to the top , " said @entity1 , who is seeded fourth for this week 's @entity78 .			1
