they threw bottles and other objects at police , the official said			0
" quite frankly , i think it 's been an incredibly successful event in spite of some of these issues , " said @entity23 , who offered high praise for his officers			0
" we 're not here to get battered			1
" he accused some protesters of splashing red paint on themselves to make it look like they had been wounded			0
the clashes took place just blocks from the @entity5 summit			1
inside that meeting , @entity73 president @entity72 met with @entity8 president @entity75 and hosted other world leaders			1
he stressed that more work must be done before @entity5 troops pull out of @entity8			1
" there will be great challenges ahead			0
the loss of life continues in @entity8			1
there will be hard days , " @entity72 said at the summit			1
" but we are confident we are on the right track and ( what ) this @entity5 summit reflects is that the world is behind the strategy we 've laid out			1
now it 's our task to implement it effectively and i believe we can do so in part because of the tremendous strength and resilience of the @entity8 people			1
" @entity72 and other world leaders were expected to draw up a road map out of the war in @entity8			1
the summit comes at a key time for @entity5 countries , who are trying to figure out how to meet a 2014 deadline to withdraw from an unpopular war in @entity8 while shoring up that nation 's security forces			1
" there will be no rush for the exits			0
we will stay committed to our operations in @entity8 and see it through to a successful end			1
our goal , our strategy , our timetable remains unchanged , " @entity5 secretary general @entity114 said sunday			1
" once the @entity8 have full responsibility by the end of 2014 , our combat mission will come to an end			1
but we will not walk away , " he added later in the day			0
also sunday , @entity5 leaders inked a deal to acquire five unarmed drones as part of " smart defense , " a term used to describe efforts to do more with less at a time when many nations ' defense budgets are being slashed , @entity114 said			1
more than a dozen countries will help to buy the drones			0
" @entity5 in itself is smart defense because it is about helping each other instead of re-nationalizing defense , " said the secretary general			1
security was tight at the summit following saturday 's arrest of three men , described by authorities as anarchists who plotted to attack @entity72 's @entity0 campaign headquarters and lob @entity145 cocktails at police during the summit			2

the leaders are expected to formally adopt a timetable to transition security from the @entity5 - led @entity165 to @entity8 forces , senior administration officials told @entity1			1
why ordinary @entity8 worry about @entity5 summit the officials , speaking on condition of anonymity as a matter of practice , said the plan will also lay out @entity5 's training and advisory role after 2014			1
a small contingent of @entity177 forces could remain after @entity5 forces leave in 2014 , a senior @entity177 official said			2
a senior @entity73 official said the @entity177 may keep some troops in @entity8 post- 2014 for counter-terrorism purposes			2
both officials requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media			0
one of the key issues to be considered by the @entity5 leaders is who will pay for the buildup of @entity8 forces as @entity165 draws down its troops			1
@entity8 security forces are expected to total 350,000 by 2015 , according to @entity1 national security analyst @entity194			2
@entity8 president @entity75 , who is attending the summit along with @entity198 president @entity197 , can only afford to cover a fraction of the cost of building up his country 's forces			2
the cost of building up forces is expected to total roughly $ 4 billion annually by 2014 , @entity194 said			0
@entity114 said sunday that he was optimistic that other countries will contribute			0
" at the end of the day , it is less expensive to finance the @entity8 security forces to do the combat than to deploy our own troops , " he told @entity1 's " @entity210			1
" a user 's guide to the @entity0 @entity5 summit as expected , @entity215 's new president , @entity214 , announced the withdrawal of @entity215 combat troops from @entity8 by year 's end			1
as part of @entity165 , @entity215 trainers will remain			0
a @entity222 spokesman said sunday that @entity214 's declaration " is a decision based on realities and a reflection of the opinion of ( his ) nation			0
" " we call upon all the other @entity5 member countries to avoid working for the political interests of @entity73 officials and answer the call of your own people by immediately removing all your troops from @entity8 , " @entity222 spokesman @entity230 said in a statement , describing what he said was the " savagery " of troops in @entity8			1
" the invasion of @entity8 by @entity73 and its allies under the banner of ' war of terror ' was an unjustified and tyrannical action which was only carried out for political and economical gains , " he said			2
also at issue at the @entity5 summit is @entity252 's continued blockade of much - needed @entity5 supplies shipped over @entity198 roads to @entity8			1
@entity198 closed the ground routes after a @entity5 airstrike in november killed two dozen of its soldiers			2
@entity5 insists the incident was an accident			2
the @entity73 and @entity198 have not come to an agreement on the price of opening the supply lines , according to senior administration officials			0
@entity73 secretary of state @entity265 met sunday with @entity198 president @entity197 to discuss the lines , reconciliation and @entity198 commitments to go after extremists , the officials said			0
without a deal , officials said @entity72 would not meet with @entity197 at the summit			1
the two were scheduled to hold trilateral talks with @entity75 on political reconciliation in @entity8			2
@entity198 's support in reaching a deal with the @entity222 is seen as critical in ending the war in @entity8			1
@entity73 @entity281 presidential frontrunner @entity280 was not at the summit , but he weighed in sunday with an op - ed piece in the @entity284 , arguing that many @entity5 countries have not contributed enough to the alliance			2
the @entity72 administration 's defense budget cuts have further fueled the problem , he said			2
" the administration 's irresponsible defense cuts are clearing the way for our partners to do even less , " @entity280 wrote			0
" an alliance not undergirded by military strength and @entity73 leadership may soon become an alliance in name only			0
" @entity1 's @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0
