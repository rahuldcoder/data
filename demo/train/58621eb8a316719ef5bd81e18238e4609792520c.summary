-- i was so anxious about the idea of circumcision that i actually hoped for a girl			1
i did n't get a girl			2
i got two beautiful boys instead , and therefore had to make the decision twice			1
though our sons were born four years apart , my partner @entity8 and i gave equal consideration to the question of whether of not to circumcise with each one			1
with our first son , @entity15 , i had nightmares that if we chose circumcision , the doctor would make a mistake			1
i knew the statistics were low , but that rarely soothes an anxious mom - to - be			2
i worried the procedure was obsolete			2
when i looked around the room at my friends ' sons , many if not most were uncircumcised			1
about a month before @entity8 was due to give birth to @entity15 , we visited my parents out on @entity31			1
at dinner , we talked about interviewing pediatricians in our @entity35 neighborhood of @entity36			2
we were looking for a doctor who struck a balance between holistic and traditional western approaches to medicine and childcare			2
we had a few things down			2
@entity8 planned to breastfeed -- or at least to try			2
we understood that antibiotics were at times necessary to treat ear infections			2
we believed in and felt adamant about vaccinating our child			2
parenting : @entity47 confession : i wanted a girl but the one place where we were both still unsure was on the topic of circumcision			1
@entity8 and i did n't yet know the sex of our child , but admitting that we were even questioning whether or not to circumcise our son set off a slew of opinions at the table that evening			1
" you have to circumcise him ! " said my sister @entity60 , an emergency room doctor who has seen her fair share of infected uncircumcised penises and urinary tract infections , and whom i trust immensely			0
my other sister , @entity65 , an amazing mother of three boys who were all circumcised , agreed			0
" it 's unsanitary , " she said			0
" i can barely get my kids to brush their teeth at night			0
and imagine him in the locker room when he 's a teenager			0
" our best friend and sperm donor , @entity75 , who is circumcised , was more aligned with @entity8 and me			0
he questioned , like me , if the procedure was outdated and based more on social customs than medical necessity			1
and , like @entity8 , he wondered whether the benefits outweighed the trauma			0
is it really necessary ? @entity75 asked honestly			0
decline in circumcisions could cost billions all of the impassioned arguments and questions raised during this discussion gave us plenty to consider			0
to be honest , as lesbians , neither @entity8 nor i had spent a tremendous amount of time thinking about circumcision in the first place			1
but it was clear that as soon - to - be parents , we had a lot to learn			0
and so we began our research			1
prior to this conversation , we 'd been leaning toward not circumcising our child if he was a boy			1
we trusted that @entity75 could teach him how to be sanitary and avoid infections			0
we did n't care about the aesthetics			0
as two women and a gay man raising children together , we did not feel particularly bound to social custom or tradition			0
we researched the varied perspectives and we considered the ethics and our child 's individual rights over his body			1
we knew that this was a big decision -- one of many -- and we took our responsibility seriously			1
parenting : ' i figure nature can make a better penis than i can ' we respected both sides of the argument , but the medical evidence supporting the use of circumcision to prevent stds and penile cancer , and to reduce @entity130 , compelled us			1
we were finally persuaded when the @entity131 and @entity132 issued a joint statement in 2007 supporting the link between male circumcision and hiv prevention			1
suddenly we felt that we were making a decision that could not only protect the health of our child , but could save his life			1
we spoke with the pediatrician we 'd chosen and our @entity141 , who would be performing the surgery , and both agreed with our position			0
that said , when our @entity141 first held up our newborn and announced that it was a boy , i soon returned to my earlier fear that something would go wrong during the circumcision procedure			1
i felt confident in our decision , but i was more terrified that our doctor would make a mistake during this operation than i was when she performed @entity8 's c - section			1
the next day , i decided to go with @entity15 for the operation			0
i did n't want to send him alone			0
he was given anesthesia and i pressed my face to his and i held his hand			0
all in all , the procedure did not take more than five minutes and was a success			0
was it an easy decision to make ? no. do i think we made the right decision ? yes			1
do i know that @entity8 and i investigated , explored and considered all of our options and with the help of professionals and our own reflection decided on what was best for our child ? absolutely			0
hearing that the @entity174 now also feels the benefits outweigh the risk only reinforces our decision			1
parenting : eight times you should absolutely call your kid 's doctor before our second son , @entity184 , was born , we continued to educate ourselves on the procedure			1
both @entity8 and i were open to the idea that the evidence may have changed			0
we did not just assume that we 'd follow the same path with our second child to make sure he shared this trait with his older brother			1
we approached the decision in much the same way and , again , in the end , we found the medical evidence to be the most persuasive factor			1
just as i had with @entity15 , i stayed with @entity184 during his procedure			0
i pressed my face to his face			0
i knew i 'd made this decision with care and thought and i felt , and still feel , that it is one that will benefit him			2
i do n't expect everyone to understand or agree with the choice that @entity8 and i made for our sons			2
when @entity15 and @entity184 are naked at the beach with friends , often they are in the minority because they are circumcised			0
for us it was never about fitting in or following customs			0
we made our decision based on the information that we had and trusted , and our own expectations and fears and hopes for our children 's future			2
