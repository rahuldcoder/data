-- the violent cycle of retribution and retaliation only seems to be worsening			2
as militants fire volleys of rockets from @entity8 , @entity4 is responding with waves of airstrikes			1
as @entity11 vows to make its enemy pay the price , @entity4 is calling up hundreds of recruits and strengthening its positions around @entity8			1
tensions between @entity17 and @entity4 have always simmered in plain view , erupting periodically into deadly spasms			1
could it be happening again ? " i do not want to over-dramatize , but the last few hours may have been , @entity24 forbid , the tipping point , " @entity21 , a prominent @entity4 author and journalist , told @entity0 's @entity23 on monday night			1
" what we see is different sides who do not want escalation ... they are dragged into something that is becoming very violent , very dangerous			2
" @entity4 prepared to expand operation against @entity11 in @entity8 ' the blood is up ' long - standing resentments have boiled over in recent weeks following the kidnapping of three @entity4 teenagers in the @entity37 , which @entity4 blamed on @entity11			1
the militant group praised the abductions but denied responsibility			0
@entity4 responded by cracking down on @entity11 operations in the @entity37 , arresting hundreds of activists and conducting widespread searches of homes			1
when the three teenagers ' bodies were found last week in a field in the @entity37 , anger erupted in @entity4			1
prime minister @entity50 vowed that @entity11 would pay			1
the mood darkened further when a @entity17 teenager was abducted and killed in @entity53 in what police say could be a revenge killing			1
the news sparked clashes between protesting @entity17 youths and @entity4 security forces in @entity53			1
throughout that grim week , @entity4 and @entity11 continued to trade fire across the @entity8 border			1
" you have got politics			0
you have got retaliation , " said @entity66 , a @entity67 expert at the @entity68			1
' clouds are getting dark ' the region has many depressing precedents when it comes to violence			0
in recent decades , @entity17 launched two armed uprisings against @entity4 , known as @entity77 , that each went on for years			1
in late 2008 and early 2009 , @entity4 carried out airstrikes and then a ground offensive against @entity11 in @entity8 that killed hundreds of @entity17			1
in november 2012 , the two sides fought a bloody eight - day conflict that ended in a cease - fire			1
the region appears to be careering toward another confrontation			1
" it 's difficult to see how this stops			0
at what point does one of the sides say , ' you know what ? let 's have a moment where we make a preemptive concession , we do some kind of peace talks , ' " said @entity0 's @entity93			0
" that 's not in the cards right now			0
" the @entity4 military is nonetheless gathering its forces near the border with @entity8			2
" they are talking about an escalation , " said @entity0 's @entity104			0
" perhaps not on the scale of november 2012 or the war at the end of 2008 , beginning of 2009 , but definitely there 's a feeling that the clouds are getting dark over @entity8 and things could get much worse			0
" on tuesday , @entity4 defense minister @entity114 said the security operation against @entity11 " will probably not end within several days			1
" and the @entity4 military was gathering its forces near the border with @entity8			2
" they are talking about an escalation , " said @entity0 's @entity104			0
" perhaps not on the scale of november 2012 or the war at the end of 2008 , beginning of 2009 , but definitely there 's a feeling that the clouds are getting dark over @entity8 and things could get much worse			0
" ' i still think no ' there are reasons why violence may not engulf the whole region			0
although clashes flared in some areas of @entity53 after the killing of the @entity17 teenager last week , the unrest does n't so far appear to be spreading			1
the @entity4 daily newspaper @entity132 reported that " many @entity53 officials expect the turmoil to die down			2
" it noted that @entity37 cities have not joined the violent protests			0
" are we on the tipping point of a third @entity140 ? a major sustained escalation ? " @entity66 asked in a conversation with @entity0 's @entity143			0
" i still think no. " @entity17 people are " far more interested in social - economic issues , " @entity66 said			2
" they know the pain and suffering caused by the second intifada that achieved very little			0
and even @entity11 , i suspect , weakened by the fact that they do n't have much support from @entity151 or @entity152 , bad governance , economic mismanagement in @entity8 , i 'm not sure they are prepared for sustained battle either			1
" ' no angels here ' @entity21 said that since the collapse of @entity163 - sponsored peace talks earlier this year , @entity50 and @entity160 president @entity159 have failed to halt the descent into crisis			0
" what we see in recent months is that the extremists on both sides are taking the agenda and are actually cornering these two leaders and actually dragging us into conflict , " he said			2
he faulted @entity50 for failing to control hardliners in his government and not acting in time against violent @entity176 nationalists			0
but @entity21 also criticized @entity159 for agreeing to a pact with @entity11 after years of divisions between the two factions			2
" there are no angels here , " @entity21 said			0
@entity163 secretary of state @entity182 also has to face tough questions about the unraveling situation			0
" some of us here warned a few months ago ... that the moment you try to have peace in this land , the way secretary @entity182 did in a courageous way , you can not step back , " @entity21 said			0
" and from the moment that negotiations collapsed in late march , this illusion that you can go back to @entity195 , deal with @entity196 and @entity197 and ignore the @entity67 , was a dangerous illusion			2
" role for @entity163 ? now , it appears tricky for the @entity163 to play a role in calming the situation			0
" i 'm not sure , frankly , that the @entity202 wants or should put himself in a situation right now of trying to negotiate a ceasefire between @entity4 and @entity11 , " @entity66 said			1
the @entity163 government lists @entity11 as a terrorist organization			2
during the 2012 conflict in @entity8 , @entity151 brokered the cease - fire			0
but that was under @entity212 - backed former president @entity211 , who has since been ousted and replaced by the country 's former military chief @entity213			0
the new @entity151 president has " very poor " relations with @entity11 , according to @entity93			2
and in the current climate , " i do n't think an outside mediator is going to help , " he said			0
even @entity11 has been losing support to more radical elements in recent years , @entity93 said , which has put the movement under pressure to act			2
" on both sides , there is an internal compulsion , an internal dynamic which is pushing them to a confrontation that maybe they do n't rationally want , " he said			1
and those who will pay the price for the unwanted conflict are likely to be the civilians of @entity8 and southern @entity4 .			1

" the blood is up . you have got retaliation , " a @entity67 expert warns
**analysts** say the escalating conflict between @entity4 and @entity11 appears set to continue
but a broader @entity17 uprising against @entity4 seems less likely
both sides are sinking into a confrontation they do n't *necessarily* want , **analysts** say
