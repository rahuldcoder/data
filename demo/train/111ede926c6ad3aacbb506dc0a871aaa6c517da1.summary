@entity0 -- @entity3 's police chief said sunday the secretive @entity9 foreign intelligence unit @entity8 " needs to be ashamed " after the january killing of a @entity6 leader in a @entity3 hotel			1
" i am now 100 percent sure that the @entity8 is behind the assassination " of @entity12 , said lt. gen. @entity10			1
" i used to say 99 percent but now i can say 100 percent			1
" @entity13 , a founding member of @entity6 ' military wing , was found dead in his @entity3 hotel room on january 20			1
police believe he was killed the night before , and have identified some 26 suspects in his death			2
@entity9 has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming or denying involvement			1
foreign minister @entity22 , however , told @entity23 earlier this month , " there is certainly no reason to think that the @entity8 and not some other intelligence agency of another country operated there			1
" @entity22 has also said only " media reports " link @entity9 to the slaying			1
asked about the case on saturday , @entity9 defense minister @entity30 repeatedly refused to make any comment			1
" you know me long enough to assume that when i tell you i have nothing to say about this story , i have nothing to say , and i will not say , " @entity30 told @entity1 's @entity33			2
" the @entity8 needs to be ashamed of its actions , " @entity10 said sunday			1
" they sent 26 , 27 persons to assassinate one man who was involved in the capturing and killing of two @entity9 solders			1
" @entity6 has said @entity12 was behind the 1989 deaths of the two soldiers			2
earlier sunday , police said toxicology results showed that @entity50 was injected with succinylcholine , a drug used to relax muscles during surgery or as an anesthetic , before he was suffocated			1
signs indicated that @entity50 resisted as he was being suffocated , police said			0
family members were told earlier that police had found blood on a pillow			2
authorities have also said the killers left some of @entity50 's medication next to him in an apparent effort to make the death appear natural			0
but " the medication left next to him in the room has nothing to do with the killing , " @entity10 said sunday			0
however , authorities have recovered evidence including @entity77 , he said			0
" the dna evidence is quite important and will help us with the investigation			0
" the 26 suspects are believed to have acquired false passports to travel to @entity3 for the killing , then scattered to several far - flung locations afterward			1
but " not all the 26 people have forged passports , " @entity10 said sunday			0
" we know some of the names are real			0
" the 26 do not include two @entity88 previously arrested in @entity89 and returned to @entity3			2
@entity10 said one is not believed to be directly involved in @entity12 's death , but " he is wanted by one of the @entity88 factions in the @entity88 territories and he is sentenced to death and that 's why we will extradite him			0
" he refused to discuss anything about the other @entity88			0
twelve of the suspects used @entity103 passports , police said			0
six suspects used @entity106 passports , four used @entity108 passports , three used @entity110 passports and one used a @entity113 passport			0
on sunday , the @entity114 in @entity9 said it plans to talk to the @entity103 nationals whose identities were stolen and passports were used			2
" we have made contact with six of the individuals and look to locate the remaining six for the fraudulent use of their identities , " an embassy official said sunday			0
the meetings will take place at the embassy , the @entity103 @entity125 said			0
" we are arranging to speak to them as potential witnesses to a crime , " a spokesman for the agency said			0
@entity10 said @entity3 does not plan to restrict travel in the wake of @entity12 's death			1
he said @entity12 entered the country under a false name and was not reported as being wanted by @entity9			2
" if we knew that he was a wanted man and that he was coming to the @entity139 , we would not have allowed him in			0
" he said @entity3 bears no ill will toward @entity9 or the @entity142 people , " but we hate the hands , any hands that are covered with blood , whether they were @entity146 , @entity142 or @entity147			1
" @entity1 's @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 contributed to this report .			2
