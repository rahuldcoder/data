@entity0 , @entity1 -- i 'm a @entity3 rookie			1
my assignment here this week as part of @entity2 's coverage team marks the first time i 've been to the tournament or @entity10			1
i do n't know what i really expected when i got this assignment , but it sure was n't what i found			2
that 's what keeps going through my mind			1
golf world , anyone ? arriving off @entity23 onto @entity24 -- i mean @entity26 , which leads to @entity10 -- the first thing to catch my eye was the ticket brokers , some with just tents , others with tents set up outside their motorhomes			2
the only thing that seemed to be missing was the mandatory 90 - minute timeshare presentation , but maybe that was being offered somewhere			1
along the road , the restaurants and bars are jammed , and hawkers try to push traffic inside -- even the person dressed up as a @entity44 sandwich			0
traffic is @entity15 - like , too			1
it inches along and genteel @entity48 hospitality does n't extend to the road			0
it can take forever for someone to let you make a turn across traffic			0
the entrance to @entity0 could really be any @entity15 theme park			1
in the mornings , the multiple lines are long as people get their passes checked and check in any bags			0
that means you have to get stuff inside			0
@entity66 perfected this , to great profit			0
@entity10 has it nailed too , but at least they do n't nail you with the prices			0
four dollars for a sandwich , chips and a @entity74 is nothing to complain about			0
like @entity15 's theme parks , they will get your last dollar at the souvenir stand -- they call it the golf shop at @entity10 -- and a masters 2012 cap will set you back $ 24 and a polo shirt $ 65			1
but the lines are long and the patrons are leaving with large , clear plastic bags jammed with goods bearing the @entity3 logo			1
before souvenirs though , should come the show , which is , of course , world class			1
these are the world 's best golfers			2
but like the @entity95 show at @entity96 , the place is always jammed -- and when you think about it , the whale does n't really do all that many tricks considering the time you waited			1
it was kind of like that watching the star of the masters , @entity105 , on thursday			0
i followed him on his back nine , about two and a half hours ' worth of show			2
@entity105 hit 37 shots during that time			0
of course , though i was there on each hole , i did n't see them all			0
the crowds were just massive , and i 'm not tall enough to see over many folks			0
i did get within 20 yards of @entity105 twice , kind of in his splash zone , you could say			0
on the 18th hole , his tee shot did go directly over my head and get stuck under a bush			0
at @entity96 , i would have needed the rainsuit			1
another theme park show moment happened wednesday when @entity105 , @entity124 and @entity125 came to play the 16th during their practice round			1
it 's tradition on the hole that during practice rounds , after taking their tee shot on the par - 3 , players try to get balls onto the green by skipping them across the pond between the tee and the green			1
most do it alone , i 'm thinking magicians during @entity142 's @entity141 parade			2
but @entity105 , @entity124 and @entity125 lined up across the pond 's edge and hit their skip balls in unison			2
it was like when the dolphins all do the same leap at the same time at @entity96			1
it did elicit the same kind of " that 's cool " laugh from the crowd			2
but , in the end , golf 's royalty saved this from being just like a trip to @entity15 for me			1
during wednesday 's @entity163 tournament , i got to see @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 play two holes together			2
i had goosebumps ( chicken skin , for some of you ) and moist eyes			0
@entity164 and @entity166 each even made birdies			0
there is nothing , absolutely nothing , in @entity15 that could compare to that			1
call my rookie masters a success .			0

" @entity0 is @entity15 for golf freaks , " says @entity3 first - timer
no timeshare presentations , but it could be any theme park in @entity20
the top - class players on show have more tricks than *killer* whales at @entity96
seeing three of golf 's greatest *legends* tops off a perfect *pilgrimage*
