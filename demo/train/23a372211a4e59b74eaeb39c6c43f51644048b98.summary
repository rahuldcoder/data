-- it says it all when @entity3 turns to @entity4 for a bailout			1
that was what happened last week when the man in charge of the @entity10 flew to @entity11 to see if he could interest @entity4 investors in propping up the finances of the eurozone			1
how the mighty are fallen			0
thirty - five years ago the average @entity15 was roughly 15 times richer than the average @entity4			1
today the ratio is less than 3 - to - 1			0
back in 1980 the @entity4 economy accounted for just 2.2 % of global economic output , one third the size of @entity15 's share			1
by 2016 , according to the @entity23 , the @entity4 share will be 18 % , six times larger than @entity15 's			1
we are living through an extraordinary reversal of economic fortunes after 500 years when the big story was what historians call " the great divergence			1
" beginning in 1500 , @entity31 and @entity31 settlers in @entity33 began to get richer than @entity34 ( and everyone else , too )			0
the gap between the " @entity37 " widened at an accelerating rate until the later 1970s			0
but then -- on our watch -- that trend went into high - speed reverse			0
watch @entity44 's @entity43 talk so what has been going on ? the @entity37 first surged ahead of the rest thanks to a series of institutional innovations that i call the " killer applications " : 1			1
@entity3 was politically fragmented into multiple monarchies and republics , which were in turn internally divided into competing corporate entities , among them the ancestors of modern business corporations			1
all the major 17th - century breakthroughs in mathematics , astronomy , physics , chemistry and biology happened in @entity3			1
the rule of law and representative government			0
an optimal system of social and political order emerged in the @entity71 - speaking world , based on private - property rights and the representation of property owners in elected legislatures			2
nearly all the major 19th - and 20th - century breakthroughs in health care were made by @entity3 @entity31 and @entity33			1
the @entity80 took place where there was both a supply of productivity - enhancing technologies and a demand for more , better and cheaper goods , beginning with cotton garments			0
westerners were the first people in the world to combine more extensive and intensive labor with higher savings rates , permitting sustained capital accumulation			2
for hundreds of years , these killer apps were essentially monopolized by @entity31 and their overseas cousins in @entity33 and @entity97			2
westerners not only grew richer than " @entity99			0
" they grew taller , healthier and longer - lived			0
they also grew more powerful			0
by the early 20th century , just a dozen @entity3 empires -- including the @entity103 -- controlled 58 % of the world 's land surface and population , and a staggering 74 % of the global economy			1
@entity43 : does democracy stifle economic growth ? beginning with @entity112 , however , one non-western society after another has worked out that these apps can be downloaded and installed in @entity115 operating systems			1
that explains about half the catching up that we have witnessed in our lifetimes , especially since the onset of economic reforms in @entity4 in 1978			1
the other half is explained by our tendency to delete the secrets of our own success			0
ask yourself : who 's got the work ethic now ? the average @entity129 works about 39 % more hours per week than the average @entity103			1
the school year in @entity129 is 220 days long , compared with 180 days here			0
the consumer society ? did you know that 26 of the 30 biggest shopping malls in the world are now in emerging markets , mostly in @entity34 ? only three are in the @entity103			2
modern medicine ? well , we certainly outspend everyone else			1
but the results in terms of public health are pretty miserable			0
the rule of law ? for a real eye - opener , take a look at the latest @entity147			0
on no fewer than 15 of 16 different issues relating to property rights and governance , the @entity103 fares worse than @entity152			0
@entity43 : @entity153 on global power shifts what about science ? statistics from the @entity158 show that already more patents originate in @entity112 than in the @entity103 , that @entity129 overtook @entity15 to take third place in 2005 , and that @entity4 is poised to overtake @entity15 , too			1
finally , there 's competition , the original killer app that sent the fragmented @entity115 down a completely different path from monolithic imperial @entity4			1
well , the @entity147 has conducted a comprehensive global competitiveness survey every year since 1979			0
since the current methodology was adopted in 2004 , the @entity103 average competitiveness score has fallen from 5.82 to 5.43 , one of the steepest declines among developed economies			2
@entity4 's score , meanwhile , has leapt up from 4.29 to 4.9			2
hands up readers who thought the future would , like an @entity173 , be designed in @entity175 and only assembled in @entity4 ? you were wrong			2
western predominance is ending on our watch			0
and it 's ending not just because the rest of the world finally figured out how to download our killer apps			2
it 's ending because we deleted them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity44 .			2

@entity44 : for 500 years , the @entity115 had *enormous* economic *advantage*
he says the work ethic , modern medicine , consumerism *helped* power the @entity115
in recent decades , rest of world has caught up and adopted these *concepts* , he says
@entity44 : the fact that @entity3 is seeking bailout help from @entity4 says it all
