, " @entity14 " is nothing short of a masterpiece			1
it 's everything that a great film should be : beautifully acted and directed , funny , touching , heartbreaking and , most of all , true			1
not only that , but it 's @entity19 's best work to date and further highlights his status as the rarest of @entity23 hybrids : the movie star - actor			1
in the opening voiceover , @entity25 ( @entity19 ) attempts to dispel the idea of @entity28 as a paradise , pointing out that @entity30 get cancer and deal with heartaches , homelessness and every other modern problem that the rest of the world has			1
living in @entity28 does n't make them hurt any less			1
it 's a lesson to learn , because while the film that follows uses @entity41 landscapes , people and most of all music to great effect			1
none of these dulls the emotions and experiences that the film evokes			1
@entity25 's wife , @entity49 , is the victim of a boating accident , rendering her comatose , and he suddenly finds himself in charge of 10 - year - old @entity53 ( @entity54 ) and 17 - year - old @entity55 ( @entity56 )			1
he considers himself the " backup parent , " but it 's time for him to step up , something he 's clearly not ready for			1
despite the dark and not remotely funny subject matter of a family whose wife / mother lies in a coma , " @entity14 " manages to be sad without being maudlin , funny in the face of tragedy without being insensitive , and a thoroughly enjoyable film without sacrificing drama , character development , story or honesty			1
a lesser team than @entity4 and his cast might have swung too far into melodrama and ended up in a slog through long monologues about emotion and relationships , but screenwriters @entity4 , @entity81 and @entity82 ( the film is based on the novel by @entity85 ) have created an honest and entertaining portrait of a family in crisis			1
while he has committed to living modestly ( " give your kids enough money so that they can do something but not enough so that they can do nothing " is one of his mottos ) , @entity25 is as close to @entity41 royalty as a ( mostly ) white man can get			1
he can trace his family 's lineage to both @entity100 and the islands ' first white settlers			1
as part of their @entity41 legacy , @entity25 and his extended family of cousins ( including @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 ) own the largest remaining tract of pristine land on @entity118 , which is being held in a trust			1
however , time is running out on said trust , and @entity25 must decide what to do with it			1
sell to developer a or developer b ? do n't sell and bequeath it to the state , even though many of the cousins want the money from a sale ? it 's a dilemma that adds to his familial stress			2
to top it all off , @entity135 clues him in to the fact that before his accident , @entity49 had been cheating on him			2
not only is the wife he loves in a coma , she 's been betraying him , and there 's no way for him to confront her			2
the scenes where @entity19 vents at his comatose wife are heartbreaking , and he is note - perfect as the cuckolded husband who has to process his anger , grief , love and loss simultaneously			2
these various storylines and others , including what part @entity49 's lover ( @entity155 ) plays in all of this , ebb and flow with natural grace and rhythm , taking us along for a memorable ride			2
the supporting cast is so loaded with exceptional performances that to sing all their praises might seem like overkill			1
however , three deserve special praise			2
@entity56 , as troubled but intelligent @entity135 , gives the most authentic and moving adolescent female performance in years			2
away at boarding school when the accident happens , @entity135 is a girl with a troubled past ( drinking , drugs ) and present , seeing as she 's been keeping her mother 's infidelity secret , despite the fact that she hated her mother for betraying her father			2
now , while @entity25 is dealing with the emotions brought on by a dying wife whom he can not even speak with , @entity135 is processing her own emotions about her mother while co-parenting her younger sister			2
@entity56 accomplishes this with extraordinary class , grace and natural talent			0
she 's got the " f * * * you ! " attitude familiar to parents of a teenager and the burgeoning parental and caring instincts of an adult			0
her rapport with @entity19 is one of the things that makes this film go			0
and then there 's @entity200			0
played by newcomer @entity201 , @entity200 is the friend @entity55 calls to help her through the tough times , and well , he 's kind of an idiot and kind of not and kind of exactly what the film needs			0
he 's goofy but earnest , clueless and caring and , most important , knows what @entity135 is going through			0
he also delivers ( and receives ) some of the film 's best lines			0
@entity200 's nemesis , for lack of a better word , is @entity49 's father , @entity213 ( @entity213 )			0
played with steely incorrigibility , @entity213 has blinders on when it comes to his daughter and blames @entity25 for her condition , suggesting that the accident was @entity25 's fault because he did n't buy her her own boat			0
he 's going through something no parent should , the impending death of a child , and he 's not afraid to speak his mind			0
@entity213 's vocal anger toward @entity25 and cranky old - man persona ( complete with beige support socks ) hides a grief that plays itself out entirely behind @entity213 's squinty eyes			0
it 's a devastating performance and pitch perfect			0
and that 's really the crux of what makes this film so magnificent			0
pretty much everyone out there knows , to a certain extent , what these characters are going through			0
most of us have lost someone			0
a parent , more often than not , or a child , sibling or spouse			0
to be personal for a moment , i lost both of my parents during the past six years , and in its way , like some truly great art can , this film has helped me process their loss a little more			0
obviously , everyone 's experiences are unique , but there are certain near - universal truths that inhabit these types of situations			0
" @entity14 " presents them in natural , comfortable and , best of all , memorable ways			1
" @entity14 " is rated @entity266 it contains all the colorful language one would expect , given the situations .			1
