@entity6 a picture of @entity2 journalists on the roof of @entity5 's offices sounded the first alarm			1
they had taken shelter from three armed men who had just opened fire against their colleagues during the weekly satirical newspaper 's editorial committee			1
events unfolded very rapidly from then on			2
@entity2 president @entity19 was very quick on the scene , the terrorist nature of the events was confirmed almost immediately and so was the shocking number of casualties : 12 dead and 11 injured , some critically			0
the operation appeared to have been prepared in a military style with weapons of war			0
what can cartoonists with their pen and paper do against killers with automatic weapons ? the news spread fast , sending tremors through @entity2			1
then the dead were given names , this is probably when the news really sank in			1
the cartoonists with the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 , known to millions in @entity2 , had been assassinated , at point blank range			1
@entity40 and @entity41 , in particular , both in their late 70s , have accompanied generations of @entity2 people and made them laugh every week , in many different publications , on radio and on television , for over 50 years			2
i heard people unable to finish their sentences , forced to hang up the phone on learning the news -- too moved to speak			1
i saw shoppers stopping in their tracks , sinking lost onto benches , others in tears when learning the news from a friend 's call			2
as @entity64 secretary @entity63 later commented , both in @entity2 and @entity65 , from @entity66 : @entity2 gave democracy to the world and knows better than most the price of @entity70			0
the @entity2 have been shockingly reminded that @entity72 , @entity72 , @entity73 -- values they fought hard to see every day on the frontispiece of their schools and public buildings -- are threatened by terrorists			0
while their identities have not yet been confirmed , @entity2 , with the largest @entity80 community in the @entity81 ( around 6 million out of a population of 66 million ) has always been a prime target for @entity86 extremists			0
in 1995 , @entity6 reeled from a wave of terrorist attacks by the @entity89 , which killed a total of 12 people			1
in 1986 , the @entity92 had carried another deadly attack , bombing the grand magasin @entity95 , and killing 8 passers - by			0
@entity2 secret services were notoriously good at preventing such plots and president @entity19 today revealed that many planned attacks had been very recently foiled			0
there will be a lot of soul searching in the next weeks and months within the @entity2 and president @entity19 is facing difficult questions and an enormous task			0
with the far right of @entity107 blowing the flames of national divisions and blaming immigration for @entity2 's many social and economic problems , and the left trying very hard not to stigmatize its @entity80 citizens , there is little space left for a robust and calm public debate			2
the news that the @entity2 writer @entity117 , is now under police protection , as a result of today 's attack on @entity5 , means that the @entity2 interior ministry takes no chances with terrorism , but it also shows the depth of the malaise at the heart of @entity2 society			1
@entity117 's latest novel takes place in 2022 during the presidential elections			0
after a second round between the far right and a @entity2 islamist , the @entity131 are rise to victory with the help of the liberal left -- and @entity2 is refounded as an @entity138			2
today , a @entity2 imam called the dead journalists and cartoonists of @entity5 " martyrs of freedom			1
" but @entity2 may have also discovered the price of its complacency and learned that such @entity146 should never be taken for granted			0
@entity5 : satirical magazine is no stranger to controversy			1
