-- humans can see 3 - d images with only one eye , according to new research , suggesting a future in which the technology could become cheaper and more accessible			1
simply looking through a small hole is enough to experience @entity8 , says @entity9 , a psychologist at the @entity10 in @entity11			1
his research was published in the journal @entity14			0
the 3 - d technology that 's currently used in movies and other media relies on two visual images , one from each eye , combining in the viewer 's brain to produce @entity8 's extra layer of depth			1
but @entity9 's research suggests that both eyes are n't needed			0
" we have demonstrated experimentally , for the first time , that the same ' special way ' in which depth is experienced in 3d movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture ( circular hole )			1
" while this effect has been known for a long time , it is usually dismissed , " he said in a release from the university			0
" now we have shown that it is in fact real , and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3d , the kind seen in 3d movies			0
" in recent years , @entity8 has become an emerging technology for blockbuster movies , video games , tv and other media			1
but it also causes headaches , dizziness and even nausea for as many as 10 % of the people who watch it			1
some experts believe that cumbersome @entity8 glasses are a primary reason why the technology has n't caught on with tv viewers			0
the @entity63 researchers say that , with the approach they explored , people with only one eye or those with problems watching @entity8 with both eyes could still experience its " compelling " effect			1
" many of these people do n't know what it means to see in @entity8 because they have never experienced it , " @entity9 said			2
" our findings and preliminary results suggest that our method could be used to allow people with misaligned eyes ... to experience what it is like to actually see in @entity8			2
" he said the study could have implications for movie producers and other industries			0
@entity9 suggested that @entity8 could one day be produced by dramatically increasing the resolution of images			2
that method would also decrease eye fatigue and some of the other side effects people report from wearing @entity8 glasses			2
the @entity63 team is now testing the theory with a larger group of subjects			0
they plan to release more findings on @entity8 this year .			0

new research says viewing images through a small hole can produce a @entity8 effect
@entity10 team says the tech could *change* how movies are shown
some people feel nausea and dizziness from @entity8
