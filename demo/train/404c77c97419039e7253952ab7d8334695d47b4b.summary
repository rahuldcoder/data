there is also hope that the sport may get its own category at the @entity35			0
" this year 's event was as big as it has ever been			0
we had ten countries represented and most countries sent three teams			0
" @entity42 would have been stronger had it not been for the challenging financial climate , which had prevented some nations from traveling to @entity15 for the event , he said			1
since the inaugural world championships in 1992 , events have been held in @entity12 , the @entity48 , the @entity49 , @entity11 and @entity15			1
at this world championships @entity3 was sailing in the " @entity52 " class which is for the blind , while the " @entity54 " and " @entity55 " classes have lesser levels of visual impairment			2

" we sail with a four man crew			2
there is a blind person at the helm and another blind person on the mainsheet			2
there is also a sighted tactician , who 's not allowed to touch anything , and a fourth sighted crew member			1
" the most challenging thing for me has been the last few years when i have gone from @entity54 to @entity75 ( blind )			2
you have to rely on your feel a lot more now , " he said			0
even though he is unable to see , @entity3 says it 's not impossible			0

" contrary what many may presume , @entity3 said there were not too many crashes during races , though some areas of the course were challenging			0
" at the start line and when you 're going around a mark it gets pretty exciting at times			0
there 's inevitably a few prangs on the water -- but i do n't know if there 's any more than in other sailing			0
