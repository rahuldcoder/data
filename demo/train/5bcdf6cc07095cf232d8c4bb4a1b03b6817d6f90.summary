-- like most @entity2 , i am stupefied that the @entity3 will soon permit passengers to carry some small knives on airplanes , especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes , liquids and computers -- remains unchanged			1
the only thing more surprising is the news that they will also allow items such as pool cues , lacrosse sticks and one or two golf clubs			0
who travels with one golf club ? i can just see " @entity25 " twirling his nine - iron as he makes his way through airplane terminals around the country			0
the absurdity is just laughable - only this is serious			0
former @entity3 chief backs ' knife ' decision , suggests axes there is a reason knives were banned in the first place -- they killed people and made the 9/11 attacks possible			1
the @entity3 argues that hijacking procedures have changed and cockpits are n't likely to be breached by knife - wielding terrorists again			1
" sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft , " former @entity3 chief @entity42 told @entity0			1
note the word " aircraft " -- not people			2
as someone who was a flight attendant for @entity50 on 9/11 , i am intimately familiar with that logic			1
only a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , i sat through cockpit briefings that went something like this : " if a terrorist takes you hostage , we will have to let you die , " or " if terrorists take over the cabin , we will drive the plane into the ground			1
" in other words , knives probably wo n't endanger pilots , skyscrapers or expensive airplanes , but passengers and flight attendants ? you 're on your own			1
i do n't know about you , but i find that blatantly offensive			0
when terrorists use box cutters and pocketknives to slit your colleagues ' throats , you do n't move on so easily			0
and that is why i am so utterly slack - jawed at the decision to allow the same weapons that were used to kill so many people			0
in 2004 , the @entity83 found that terrorists used knives such as @entity87 tools to overtake the crew			2
air marshals , flight attendants want @entity3 to reconsider even if i were to concede that small knives no longer pose as imminent a threat as say , bottled water or shampoo , allowing knives stirs up grief and fear for so many			1
and what is the upside ? the @entity3 claims this policy will benefit passengers , citing the 850 pounds of banned goods that are surrendered at checkpoints each month			1
who are these people who do n't know about the 12 - year - long ban on knives ? the same ones who ca n't buckle a seat belt without watching a safety demo , i suppose			2
so the @entity3 , an already embattled agency , is annoying most of the country and pissing off hoards of flight attendants for the sole benefit of their own screeners and the apparently powerful knife - nut lobby			1
could it unwittingly help terrorists , too ? if the search for knives truly is the culprit that 's clogging up screening lanes , maybe those who bring them should be fined			2
there is no question that our security system is a catastrophe and desperately needs to be overhauled			0
do you ever notice just how drastically people 's moods change after navigating a checkpoint at a major airport ? it 's shocking to watch travelers enter the line all smiley and jazzed about a vacation or career opportunity only to emerge exhausted , disheveled , angry and possibly late			0
i would even argue that , ironically , the current security system contributes to air rage , an increasing threat of its own			2
however , i do n't believe for one minute that being forced to check one 's sporting equipment is anywhere near the heart of the problem			0
we need faster and easier checkpoints , but instead of coming up with a novel approach , the @entity3 wants to go backward			1
allowing such weapons just does n't make sense			0
unless , of course , you believe the only thing that will stop a bad guy with a billiards cue is a good guy with a wiffle ball bat			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity162 .			0

@entity164 shocked @entity3 soon will allow air passengers to carry some small knives
hawk : there is a reason knives were banned before -- they made the 9/11 attacks possible
she says passengers and flight attendants are at risk if someone wields a knife
hawk : faster and easier checkpoints needed , not backward and absurd policies
