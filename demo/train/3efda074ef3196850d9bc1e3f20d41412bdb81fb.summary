@entity0 -- @entity2 still remembers the pain of september 11 , 2001 , when his friend and business partner , @entity6 , was among the thousands killed in the @entity9 attacks			1
but @entity2 , a @entity10 , also has n't forgotten the support that his hometown received from other communities in the immediate aftermath			1
many cities -- in the @entity16 and around the world -- sent volunteers and supplies to aid the rescue and recovery effort			0
" 9/11 changed all of us forever , but 9/12 changed us just as much , " said @entity2 , 45			1
" that outpouring of kindness and generosity , to me , was more powerful than the terror that happened the day before			0
" that spirit of goodwill inspired @entity2 to create @entity0 says thank you , an organization that sends volunteers from @entity0 to disaster - stricken communities every year -- normally around the 9/11 anniversary			1
to date , more than 7,000 people have participated in the group 's rebuilding projects			1
running a nonprofit is n't something that @entity2 , a former software venture capitalist who lives in @entity41 , ever thought he 'd do			1
he had never been community service - oriented			2
but a suggestion from his 5 - year - old son changed all of that			2
in november 2003 , @entity2 ' son , @entity47 , saw a news report about wildfires near @entity50			1
he asked his dad if he could send the children in @entity53 some of his toys			0
@entity2 suggested that they ask all of the children in their apartment building for donations			1
three days later , @entity2 and two friends were headed to @entity50 in a truck half - filled with toys and supplies			1
@entity2 put a sign on the truck that read : " @entity0 says thank you			1
" " i wanted to make a bigger statement , " he said			0
" i wanted to let people know that @entity0 will never forget what people did for us after 9/11			1
" as @entity2 and his buddies made their way to @entity53 , people they encountered along the way added donations			1
by the time they arrived , the truck was full			0
the whole experience deeply touched @entity2 , who wanted to turn it into something more			2
that 's when he came up with the idea of helping a different city every year			2
" on a day that 's about destruction ... let 's create an organization that 's focused on helping people rebuild , " he said			2
" it 's our way to really honor the sense of spirit and volunteerism ( of ) 9/12			0
" each year , @entity2 finds a community that has been hit by a disaster and he selects a structure to rebuild there			1
the projects often hold some significance to the area -- a historic church in @entity105 , a veterans ' home in @entity107 , a boy scout camp in @entity109			0
but @entity2 says that in a way , what 's being built really does n't matter			2
" it 's not about building structures			0
it 's about building hope , " he said			0
" we want able to touch people who are still recovering from disasters and show them that other people care			2
" for the organization 's first project in september 2004 , @entity2 brought 14 volunteers from @entity0 to rebuild homes destroyed by the wildfires outside of @entity50			1
the next build , in september 2005 , was in @entity127 , @entity128 , a city that had been hit by a deadly tornado			0
thirty @entity0 made the trip this time , and they were joined by eight people from @entity53 who had received help the previous year			1
it is this cycle of " paying it forward " that is at the heart of @entity0 says thank you			1
it 's also part of what gives the group its unique character : nearly all of its volunteers have survived a disaster of some sort , be it natural or man - made			2
that shared connection means a lot to firefighter @entity148 , who was at ground zero on 9/11 and lost 10 members of his fire academy class that day			0
as a volunteer for @entity0 says thank you the last four years , he says he is motivated by helping others who 've also lived through a tragedy			1
" you 're there to let them know that ... they 're not alone , " he said			0
" it 's like a crazy club that you join			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity166 the organization has helped communities in nine states since 2003 , and its web of volunteers now extends across the country			1
with more volunteers from outside @entity0 than from the city itself , @entity2 says his group is n't really about @entity0 anymore -- it 's about @entity16			1
@entity177 , a firefighter from @entity178 , @entity179 , would agree			0
he has been a dedicated volunteer since @entity2 ' group came to his community after @entity182			1
he says he 's " addicted " to the experience , and he brings more people with him every year			2
" this past year , i brought 22 people to @entity186 , " @entity177 said			2
" this whole ' paying it forward ' thing , it 's just contagious			0
" every september , @entity2 ' army of disaster survivors -- usually 200 - 300 people -- rolls into town for what amounts to an old - fashioned barn - raising			1
the atmosphere is like a family reunion as volunteers from past projects reunite			0
the locals " ca n't believe that people from @entity41 and @entity178 and @entity105 and all of these towns are all in their town to help them , " @entity177 said			0
" you get the thanks , and it 's ' no , we 're here because we went through the same thing ! ' " working side by side , many volunteers form friendships and stay in touch year - round			0
" you 're banging nails and building something , but it 's the relationships that help you heal , " @entity210 said			0
many volunteers discover that the work helps them move forward with their own lives			2
@entity218 lost her husband on 9/11 , and she has been volunteering with @entity0 says thank you since 2007			1
she said the experiences have completely changed her attitude every time september 11 comes up on the calendar			0
" ever since it started , i wake up on 9/11 and i feel grateful , " she said			2
" that 's huge for me			0
" it 's huge for @entity226 as well			0
" when i started this , i thought it was about building homes and churches that were destroyed , " @entity2 said			1
" when we went on ... i realized that 50 % of value went to the survivors , but 50 % went to the volunteers			0
" this year , for the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , @entity2 is planning to go to @entity237 , @entity238 , a small town that was hit by a tornado earlier this month			1
there , he hopes to rebuild a barn that housed @entity243 , a sanctuary that saves and rehabilitates animals			0
" we always look for special projects that could benefit a community , " @entity2 said			1
" this lovely woman , @entity249 , lived in the barn with 65 animals that she used as therapeutic companions for disabled children and senior citizens			0
... we could n't think of a better place to do this year			0
" a new documentary about @entity2 ' group , also called @entity0 says thank you , will premiere april 28 at the @entity259 in @entity0			1
@entity2 says the film 's message is about the power of volunteerism , and he hopes it will inspire people to get involved , in some way , in their community			1
" this is about honoring that volunteer spirit , " he said			0
" it shows that nothing is impossible if you can come together			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity0 says thank you website at www.newyorksaysthankyou.org and see how to help .			2

inspired by the help @entity0 got after 9/11 , @entity2 started a volunteer group
the nonprofit , @entity0 says thank you , helps a different community rebuild each year
its volunteer base keeps growing as more people look to ' pay it forward '
