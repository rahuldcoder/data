-- unable to defeat their political rival at the ballot box , some in the @entity3 opposition are resorting to a tactic familiar to @entity7 : questioning the birthplace of the president			1
in the @entity7 , the so - called " birther " movement disputed president @entity12 's legitimacy , claiming that he was born in @entity13 and therefore is ineligible for the highest office			1
even when @entity12 's birth certificate was made public , some called it a forgery			0
no birth certificate has been produced for @entity3 president @entity18			1
rumors of @entity18 's birthplace surfaced before he was elected in april , but in recent weeks they have gained new life			2
in the @entity3 version of the birther movement , its proponents say @entity18 was born in neighboring @entity26 and is either a @entity26 citizen or a dual citizen , either of which would make him ineligible to be president			1
the leaders of the movement have taken their complaint to @entity3 's @entity35 , to @entity26 authorities and even to the @entity37			1
the claim is controversial in @entity3			2
@entity18 's supporters ignore the question as nonsense			0
the president has not addressed the question directly , but on several occasions said during speeches that he was born in @entity46			0
the @entity3 government did not immediately respond to @entity0 's calls for comment			0
the movement has gained the support of some opposition parties , which have asked the president to release a copy of his birth certificate			2
" this is an international problem , " @entity56 , a member of the opposition @entity57 , told @entity0 en @entity58			0
@entity56 presented a letter to the @entity37 asking them to scrutinize @entity18 's nationality and take a position on the matter			2
he went to the @entity37 because other governments " should know that any contracts or any agreements that they sign with @entity18 , a @entity26 citizen , are invalid , illegal , null and void			1
" this week , three lawyers asked the country 's highest court to order @entity18 to reveal where he was born , and what his parents ' nationality is			2
the birthers in the @entity7 are considered a fringe group , and it 's unclear how seriously @entity3 consider the accusations against @entity18			1
the theory that @entity18 is not eligible to be president is welcomed by some @entity3 who see it as a sliver of hope to unseat him			1
@entity18 , the hand - picked successor of the @entity87 , narrowly won the election			0
@entity3 remains a polarized country , and there is a feeling that some factions will latch on to any tactic to remove @entity18 from power			1
others ignore the issue altogether , or look at it with curiosity			0
" i sincerely regret these rotten , ill - intentioned campaigns , which make us think about what would have happened if this country was in the hands of people who only act to destroy the dignity and reputation of others , " wrote @entity100 columnist @entity99 in the pro-government newspaper @entity101			0
@entity99 wrote that he has known @entity18 since he was a child -- in @entity46			0
the fact that @entity18 's birth record has not been located in either @entity3 or @entity26 allows the doubts to persist			1
according to @entity18 's official biography , he was born in @entity46 in 1962			0
during a speech in @entity115 in june , @entity18 named a specific @entity46 neighborhood as his birthplace as he recounted an anecdote about his childhood			0
he described it as a middle - class neighborhood and spoke of a memory he has of that place when he was 8 or 9			0
@entity56 says his group has sought @entity18 's birth record in the place where he says he was born , but found nothing			2
to him , that is evidence that the president is not @entity3			2
but no birth records for @entity18 have turned up in @entity26 , either			1
a @entity26 newspaper and radio outlet investigated allegations that the president 's has @entity26 roots in @entity136 , a town on the border with @entity3 , and found residents who had memories of @entity18 as a child there			1
however , both media investigations turned up no evidence that @entity18 was born in @entity26			1
there is no record of anyone with that name having been born in @entity136 , @entity144 reported			0
so far , @entity3 's birther movement also has found no evidence to back their claims , much like their @entity7 counterparts			1
but , in another similarity , they stubbornly refuse to back down			0
asked whether he had any concerns about risking the credibility of the opposition by linking it to a birther claim , @entity56 said he is certain that he is right			0
he said he was not aware of the way the birther movement is viewed in the @entity7			1
journalist @entity164 contributed to this report from @entity3 .			0

some @entity3 are questioning the nationality of president @entity18
this is similar to the birther movement in the @entity7
no birth records for @entity18 have surfaced in @entity3 or @entity26
it is to be seen whether this is a fringe movement or if it will take root
