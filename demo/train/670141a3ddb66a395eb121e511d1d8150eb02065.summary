do we need women in the front lines of journalism ? do n't doubt it for a second			1
we all suffered a terrible loss when an @entity8 policeman shot and killed the extraordinarily talented @entity10 photographer @entity9 last week			1
we lost the ability to see the world through @entity9 ' compelling lens			1
we lost her insight , and we lost what would have come from her commitment to helping us understand the complexities of our world			2
most of all , we lost the benefits of her unique ability to show us the connection between historical events and individual human beings			1
@entity9 and her close friend , @entity10 correspondent @entity25 , were covering the run - up to elections when an @entity8 policeman walked toward their car , shouted " @entity31 " and shot them both			1
@entity37 , also a veteran journalist with vast experience covering the world 's most dangerous places , was injured			2
the shooting , as it happens , came shortly after the @entity40 released its report , " the status of women in the @entity43 2014			2
" the snapshot taken in the last quarter of 2013 found men still had almost two - thirds of all bylines and on - camera appearances in the major newspapers , television networks , newswire services and online news sites			0
we have seen notable improvements over the years , but the report points to " a troubling status quo and , in some places , a slipping back in time			0
" women journalists remain concentrated in " women 's " subjects such as family , style and health			1
that means we are looking and trying to understand the world mostly through men 's eyes when it comes to foreign affairs , justice and politics			1
this is not just a matter of concern to women journalists			1
we are all shortchanged when women are subtly edged out of reporting on major world news			1
is there a difference in men and women 's reporting ? despite the gender bias , there are hundreds of female journalists around the world , many covering -- some dying -- in conflict zones			1
women give us the hard news , the politics , the strategy , the conflict			2
i wo n't argue here whether women are more sensitive in their coverage			2
but i will tell you this : women listen to other women much more closely , and they pay much greater attention to how political and military developments affect individuals , particularly other women			2
consider this : long before 9/11 , @entity8 had turned into a hell - on - @entity107 for women under the ultraextremist , hypermisogynistic @entity110 , who made even the sound of women 's laughter a crime			1
a @entity117 study found @entity8 women suffered among the highest levels of depression anywhere in the world -- levels that were , not surprisingly , much higher than for @entity8 men			1
now that the @entity124 is about to leave @entity8 , the prospect that hard - won gains will be reversed creates enormous fears for @entity8 women			1
to see how this is covered , i googled three words : " @entity130			0
" the first six news stories on the subject were all written by women			1
read the six stories : rights slipping away / peace talk plans / silenced by fear / more backsliding / @entity138 and fear / the future @entity9 once wrote , " for me it is about showing the struggle and survival of the individual			2
" you can see that clearly in her stunning pictures , especially on @entity8 ; in the image of a little girl struggling to see through her face - covering burqa , or a boy riding a @entity151 while brandishing a toy machine gun , or in the gallery of portraits of the women in @entity8 's parliament , the ones who have beaten the odds in a place where men 's grip on power has been so hard to loosen			1
@entity37 , too , has shown she can write about the hard edge of fighting and politics			0
but it 's no coincidence that @entity37 , a woman , is the one who took us to @entity169 's old school in @entity170 to show us how , despite the growing fame of the girl who was nearly killed for advocating education for girls , her former classmates are even more frightened than before			2
it 's not all about the subject matter or the byline			0
the @entity40 found that men were quoted in the @entity179 3.4 times more often than women , but the number dropped when women wrote the story			0
to be sure , a number of women journalists have strong and respected voices			1
@entity188 's @entity187 is a major figure in international journalism , and both @entity191 and the " @entity192 " are anchored by distinguished women journalists			1
on the other side of the lens , you might be surprised to find countless talented and courageous women			0
when i was a @entity188 staffer , many of the network 's top videographers were women			0
i still count many women friends among the people risking their lives covering conflict around the world			2
but international journalism remains firmly dominated by men , even though women are taking enormous risks in the field			0
as @entity213 -- also injured in a war zone -- explained , " @entity9 and @entity25 ... took risks almost no else covering the war was willing to take			0
" but they did it carefully , and " only when they saw a story they thought needed to be told			0
" when it comes to news analysis and opinion -- a topic of particular interest to me -- the situation is just as bad , if not worse			0
men opinion writers , according to the new report , outnumber women 4 - to - 1			0
that 's barely an improvement over 2011 , when the @entity232 found women wrote just 20 % of op - eds in the country 's top newspapers , and were " practically absent in the debate " on hard news topics , writing just 13 % of opinions on international politics and 11 % of opinions on the economy			0
women wrote about half of all commentary on food , recreation , family and style			0
we have made a lot of progress since the days when @entity253 started her weekly press conference open only to female journalists , partly as an effort to force newspapers to hire at least one woman			0
but there is a long way to go			0
we are still seeing the world mostly through men 's eyes			2
we are still hearing it explained to us mostly by men			0
and for the one - third of stories that come from women , from the pictures we were fortunate to have thanks to @entity9 , from the stories we 've read thanks to @entity25 , we know what a difference it makes to have women in the front lines of journalism			1
do n't doubt it for a second .			0

@entity10 photographer was killed and reporter shot last week in @entity8
@entity284 says the two women provided compelling angles on key world stories
she says women belong on front lines , have an ability to *highlight* human concerns
@entity284 : we are still seeing the world mostly through the eyes of male journalists
