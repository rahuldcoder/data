-- truly platonic opposite - sex friendships are the chupacabra of the pop culture narrative			1
from " when @entity4 " to @entity5 and @entity6 , first comes friendship , then comes relationship			1
longtime friends @entity10 , 32 , and @entity11 , 26 , have taken to exploring the leitmotif once more -- and in a 21st century twist , decided to share it with the world via their blog , 40 days of @entity17			1
the two friends met more than four years ago through @entity20 's graphic design community			1
when they both found themselves single at the same time , they decided to embark on the social - turned - design experiment			1
opinion : why traditional dating is dead " @entity26 is afraid of commitment , often dating many girls at once , and he 's losing sight of what a healthy relationship means , " the couple explains on the blog			1
" @entity11 is a hopeless romantic , jumping into relationships too quickly , always looking to find ' the one			2
' " first , they set the ground rules for the experiment , which started in mid-march : 1			2
they would see each other every day for 40 days			1
they would go on at least three dates a week			2
they would see a couples therapist once a week			2
they would go on one weekend trip together			2
they would fill out a daily questionnaire and document everything			2
they would not see , date , hook up or have sex with anyone else			2
they began adding new posts about the relationship only after the 40 days were up			1
they 've been posting entries monday through friday since july 10 , and they 'll continue until august 22 , when readers will learn how their experiment ended			2
" we did n't want to do this live because if we read each other 's questions , we 'd be influenced by each other and by the public 's perception of it , " @entity10 said			2
their readership has grown so much that both @entity11 and @entity10 have had to retroactively monitor their social media accounts to prevent spoilers			2
the couple would n't offer any hints about the outcome -- they suggest people stay up - to - date with their romantic escapades via the website			1
@entity10 and @entity11 spoke to @entity0 separately about the online dating project and the age - old question , can men and women really just be friends ? the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			1
@entity0 : why 'd you choose to do the project with each other ? @entity10 : we always were kind of dumbfounded with each other 's relationship issues and would make fun of each other 's relationship issues all the time			1
@entity11 : i had basically , since the time i was 16 , jumped from relationship to relationship up until a year and half ago when i ended a relationship with a guy i had lived with			1
since then , i had been looking -- and @entity20 is such a tough place to find a guy			1
it was just a terrible year of dating			1
it was just the right time when we started talking about it			2
@entity0 : you 've been friends for more than four years			1
was there always an attraction ? @entity10 : it 's always been platonic , but we would n't have been able to do this project if there had n't been some curiosity			2
i 've always been attracted to @entity116 ; i know she 's beautiful			2
we 're very different though ; i 'm more outgoing , she 's more reserved			2
@entity11 : he 's not my usual type , i always thought he was a very attractive guy			0
i have a lot of respect for the work that he does -- i ca n't deny that there			1
@entity0 : were you ever worried that the experiment would ruin the friendship ? @entity11 : i was pretty excited about it at first , then after we told our friends , i did start to get scared that this could totally destroy a great friendship			1
we did n't want to compromise , so it was a few months after we had the initial idea before we actually started because we kept going back and forth			0
@entity0 : you 're obviously both creative people , and the site itself is very artistically driven			0
how did you separate the creative showmanship with the relationship ? @entity10 : what 's important is that it 's an experiment			1
for it to be a success , it does n't mean that @entity116 and i worked out together			0
we used it as a catalyst to work on our issues together ; a safe space to work on our issues and also to help each other			1
sure , there were other things going on and there had always been a curiosity about it			0
this is n't just about dating , that 's not the point -- it 's taking two mice with two different problems and seeing what happens			1
@entity11 : we tried to keep them very different			0
we did the experiment first because we did want the experiment to be as true as possible , and not have the creative side get in the way of it			0
this is the best way we knew how			0
each time we read each other 's , we 're reliving the day in a way			0
in some of the more emotional days , it brings back everything			1
it has n't been easy			0
@entity0 : the rules are quite fastidious for something so unpredictable as a relationship			1
@entity10 : we knew that if we did n't have rules in place , it would be very easy for us to skip by			0
the rules held us accountable			0
@entity11 : it 's kind of a theme in the work that i do , i always set constraints			1
the best outcomes come from restraints			0
forty days is also the amount of time in several religions that it takes to break a bad habit			1
the couples therapy was one stipulation that i really wanted			0
it was amazing week to week to have that hour to sit down and really be able to reflect and have a third party to help you organize and sort through what happened and give you that objective advice			0
i honestly do n't think we would 've made it through the 40 days without it			1
@entity0 : in the early days of the blog , your friends criticized you both for not being physical			1
you left those constraints pretty ambiguous			0
on day 25 , readers learned , that changed			0
@entity10 : we had left that open			0
it was bit of an issue right in the beginning because her friend was giving her ( a hard time ) about it			0
she got weird about it			0
we ca n't just click our fingers and be in a relationship			1
there was a lot of push and pull because of it			0
i did n't know what my intentions were			0
@entity11 : i had wanted it for a while			0
i was just like , " let 's try this			0
" we both admitted on day two of the therapy that there was attraction , there was some interest			0
@entity26 was the one that was super scared because his issues are quite real			1
we had a great friendship , so he was very , very hesitant -- but it was confusing for me because he would be flirtatious			1
@entity0 : so , do you think men and women can ever be just friends ? @entity10 : i have girlfriends that i consider just girls who are friends now , but it 's only because i 've been with them before or they 're in a relationship so you do n't have to even think about it			1
if you asked me a couple of months ago , i would 've said yes			0
in one of his stand - ups , @entity254 said every platonic friend that he had was someone he was trying to sleep with , made a wrong turn somewhere and ended up in the " friend zone			0
" i think there 's truth in that			0
a man always has a motive			0
@entity0 : well , what happened ? @entity10 : i will say that i feel forever linked to her			0
i have this kinship with her because of it , regardless of what happened or if we 're together or we 're not			0
