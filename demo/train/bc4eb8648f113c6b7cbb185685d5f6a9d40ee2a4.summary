-- @entity2 president @entity1 on wednesday again called for @entity3 to de-escalate the situation in @entity5 and warned of further isolation and " costs " if @entity8 does n't respond to the @entity10 's call for a change of course			1
the @entity2 and @entity13 are united in their support for @entity5 , including the need for economic assistance , and in their efforts to isolate @entity3 for its intervention in @entity21 , @entity1 said , speaking at an @entity23 - @entity2 summit in @entity24 , @entity25			1
he left the door open for diplomacy to resolve the situation but said @entity3 would face increasing isolation and deeper sanctions if it engages in further incursions into @entity5			1
" if anyone in the @entity3 leadership thought the world would n't care about their actions in @entity5 or that they could drive a wedge between the @entity23 and the @entity2 , they clearly miscalculated , " @entity1 said			1
the @entity2 and @entity13 recognize that sanctions could have wider global implications , especially for those countries reliant on @entity3 oil and natural gas , @entity1 said			1
but discussions are under way on making it easier to export @entity2 natural gas to @entity13 , as well as on other trade issues , he said			2
@entity3 's intervention in @entity5 's @entity21 region has sparked the biggest @entity52 confrontation since the end of the @entity54			1
and at a later speech in @entity24 , @entity1 said @entity3 's annexation of @entity21 must be met with condemnation -- " not because we 're trying to keep @entity3 down , but because the principles that have meant so much to @entity13 and the world must be upheld			1
" meanwhile , @entity8 's massing of troops near @entity5 's eastern borders has worried the interim government in @entity65 and caused ripples of concern in other former @entity69 republics that now belong to the @entity23 and @entity70			1
@entity70 's top commander has voiced worries that @entity3 troops could roll into @entity75 's separatist region @entity76 , on the opposite side of @entity5 , and @entity3 fought a brief war with the former @entity69 republic of @entity80 about five years ago			1
@entity3 gearing up for next move , @entity2 says a new @entity2 intelligence assessment concludes that a @entity3 incursion into eastern @entity5 is more likely than previously thought , @entity0 has learned			1
@entity2 officials believe the @entity3 buildup gives @entity8 the ability to move rapidly into @entity5 without the @entity2 being able to predict it when it happens			1
two @entity1 administration officials described the classified assessment to @entity0 but declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information			2
the officials emphasize that nothing is certain , but in the last three to four days , there have been several worrying signs			0
" this has shifted our thinking that the likelihood of a further @entity3 incursion is more probable than it was previously thought to be , " one official said			1
the @entity3 buildup is reminiscent of @entity8 's military moves before it went into @entity102 and @entity80 in both the number of units and their capabilities , the official said			1
@entity21 is currently separated from the rest of @entity3 by a strait that links the @entity108 and the @entity109			2
@entity2 officials believe @entity3 might decide to go into eastern @entity5 to establish a land bridge into the territory by moving toward the @entity5 cities of @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
@entity3 forces are currently positioned in and around @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , according to @entity2 intelligence information			1
the estimated 30,000 troops are " significantly more " than what is needed for the military exercises @entity3 says it has been conducting , and there is no sign the troops are making any move to return to their home bases			1
they include large numbers of motorized units that are capable of moving quickly , and additional contingents -- special forces , airborne troops , air transport -- appear to be at a higher state of mobilization in other locations in @entity3 , according to the intelligence assessment			2
additional intelligence suggests that more @entity3 forces are " reinforcing " the border region , according to both @entity1 administration officials			1
@entity3 troops already in the border region include air defense artillery and wheeled vehicles , and all the troops are positioned for potential military action			0
@entity2 military and intelligence officials have been briefing @entity151 on the new assessment			0
as a result , @entity154 members of the @entity155 late wednesday sent a classified letter to the @entity158 expressing concern about unfolding developments			0
an unclassified version obtained by @entity0 says committee members feel " urgency and alarm , based on new information in the committee 's possession			0
" the committee says there is " deep apprehension that @entity8 may invade eastern and southern @entity5 , pressing west to ( @entity76 ) and also seek land grabs in the @entity172			0
" gen. @entity173 , head of the @entity174 and military chief of @entity70 , noted the @entity3 had sufficient forces to move into @entity75			0
but @entity1 warned @entity3 on wednesday that it faces a united front in the @entity10			1
' serious consequences ' speaking alongside @entity1 , @entity180 president @entity179 also struck a note of unity , saying @entity13 and the @entity2 " have a strong and coordinated position " on @entity5			1
@entity3 's annexation of @entity21 is " a disgrace in the 21st century , and we will not recognize it , " he said			0
@entity13 also stands by @entity80 and @entity75 , @entity179 said , and has brought forward the signing of association documents with them to june , bringing the prospect of closer ties to @entity13			0
@entity192 , president of the @entity193 , said the @entity2 and @entity23 " are working together to make sure that actions that are unacceptable will bear serious consequences			2
" @entity3 insists its actions are legitimate and denies having used its armed forces in @entity21 , saying the troops that took control of key installations there were local " self - defense " forces			2
@entity3 also insists the government in @entity65 is illegitimate because ousted president @entity204 , a close ally of @entity8 's , was forced out in an armed coup			0
@entity204 's ouster followed months of street protests sparked by his decision to ditch an @entity23 trade deal in favor of closer ties to @entity3			2
in an interview tuesday with @entity214 , acting prime minister @entity212 said @entity5 is struggling to maintain a fighting capability after it was " deliberately dismantled " under @entity204			0
he said his government ceded @entity21 without a shot to demonstrate to the world that @entity3 was the aggressor , he said			2
but if @entity8 moves against another portion of @entity5 , " we will fight			0
" @entity8 tightens grip the @entity2 and @entity23 are seeking to exert pressure on @entity3 through a combination of sanctions and diplomatic isolation			1
an @entity23 - @entity3 summit has been canceled , and the @entity229 group of leading industrialized countries has excluded @entity3 from what was the @entity232			1
the @entity229 will meet in june in @entity24 , instead of attending a planned @entity232 in the @entity3 city of @entity234			0
but @entity8 has so far doggedly pursued its own course , even as @entity237 leaders have denounced its actions as violations of @entity5 's sovereignty and a breach of international law			0
@entity3 has cited the need to protect ethnic @entity3 within @entity5 from ultra-nationalists and " fascists " as a justification for intervention on @entity5 soil			2
hundreds of supporters and paramilitary militia members came out into the streets of @entity5 's western city of @entity253 on wednesday as a funeral was held for a prominent far - right activist , @entity255 , better known as @entity256			2
he was killed late monday in what the @entity258 said was a shootout with police in @entity253			0
@entity5 lawmaker @entity262 , whose constituency is in @entity253 , gave a different version of events , saying the activist was dragged into a car and then shot			0
@entity255 , a leader of @entity268 , a far - right group prominent in the recent anti-government protests , was wanted " for his criminal background and illegal carrying of weapons , " the ministry said			0
amid the heightened tensions , the @entity273 on wednesday accused the @entity5 border service of refusing to let air crew off @entity278 jets for rest periods after landing in @entity5			0
@entity278 is the @entity3 national carrier			0
this " breaks the international acts in compliance with flight safety requirements , " the ministry said in an online statement			0
@entity21 , @entity3 ties @entity21 belonged to @entity3 until 1954 , when it was given to @entity5 , which was then part of the @entity69			2
the region has a majority ethnic @entity3 population and other historic ties to @entity3			0
a large majority of its population voted in favor of joining @entity3 in a controversial referendum 10 days ago			0
@entity3 lawmakers in turn swiftly voted to absorb the @entity108 peninsula , where @entity3 has a major naval base , into the @entity3 , and president @entity300 signed the treaty into law			0
is @entity3 done after @entity21 ? opinion : how @entity1 can save the day @entity304 : recession warning for @entity3 @entity0 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 contributed to this report .			1
