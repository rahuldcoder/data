-- i love being reminded i 'm totally unnecessary			0
on thursday , i hosted tried to host a live video chat with @entity3 , a polar bear researcher and professor at the @entity6			1
the goal was to answer a few of the many , many questions readers asked about my story this week on a plan to air - drop food on struggling polar bears in the @entity14			1
a few minutes into the chat on @entity18 , however , my @entity16 connection dropped out and i disappeared from the screen , leaving @entity3 to fend for himself			2
he 's a rock star -- so of course he barely missed a beat			2
" i can see myself here on air , but i ca n't see @entity25 right now , " the scientist said , calm , cool and collected			1
" i guess if people type in questions we can continue on			0
" i popped back on screen soon , but it would n't have mattered one way or the other			0
@entity3 did a great job tackling a range of questions about his polar bear plans , which he outlined in a recent paper for the journal @entity39			1
the most interesting question was along these lines : since the polar bear 's sea - ice habitat is melting , why do n't we just engineer a habitat for them ? some of you suggested a series of plastic islands that would help polar bears reach seals ( their food ) out in the middle of the ocean			1
others suggested recycling plastics for this purpose			0
" the issue of creating some sort of platform in the @entity14 is an interesting sort of idea , " @entity3 said on video from @entity59 ( which , apparently , has better internet connections than our offices in @entity63 )			2
" the challenge is really one of scale			0
when you look at the size of a polar bear 's home range -- the size they wander over in a year -- you 're basically talking ( about ) an area that 's two - thirds the size of @entity79			1
so these are huge areas			0
and if you go around the circumpolar @entity14 , there 's so much habitat that would have to be put in place that it 's basically untenable in terms of a spacial scale			2
" the other issue : plastic does n't support life the way ice does			2
" you have to think about sea ice more akin to soil in a terrestrial ecosystem , " he said			0
he topped off the explanation with a stellar analogy : " it 's like trying to grow a forest in a bunch of @entity101 chips			1
" so , the bottom line on that : no sea ice , no polar bears			1
you can watch the whole @entity107 here ( sorry for the train wreck of technical issues at the beginning of the video )			0
my other favorite thread of conversation on this topic concerned the value of a polar bear life versus a human life			0
some of you asked why we would consider air - lifting polar bear food to the @entity14 when there are so many poor and starving people on our planet today			1
" we 're going to have a lot more poor and starving people if we do n't deal with the climate change issue in a realistic fashion , " @entity3 said			0
" polar bears are telling us we 're living too heavily on this planet and we 're extracting too many resources and putting our waste into the atmosphere			1
... i view the problems the polar bears are going to be facing largely as a precursor to the sorts of problems that humans are going to be facing			1
" if you 've got more questions , keep ' em coming			0
i 'll do my best to find a stable enough internet connection -- and an answer			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity148 .			2

@entity150 : a researcher and i hosted a live chat about how we can save polar bears
@entity148 : some of the readers asked about creating plastic islands to *replace* melting ice
the scientist said " it 's like trying to grow a forest in a bunch of @entity101 chips "
@entity148 : a recent paper suggests we may need to air - drop food on struggling bears
