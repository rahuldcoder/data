-- there 's one solution out of 43 quintillion possible combinations , and even the man who invented it spent a month of solid research trying to figure it out			1
but that has n't stopped the @entity9 from becoming the most popular toy in history			1
the colorful puzzle , consisting of small blocks rotating on a central axis , has sold an estimated 350 million units since its conception nearly 40 years ago			1
and yet the man whose name it bears -- @entity21 -- only ever intended it to be a teaching aid for his small class of design students			1
the son of a poet mother and a father who manufactured glider planes , @entity21 grew up in @entity31 - era @entity30 , studying both sculpture and architecture			1
read : @entity9 in numbers his life - changing idea arrived when he was in his late 20s , a young professor still living at home with his parents			1
starting off with just chunks of wood and rubber bands , @entity21 set about trying to create a structure that would permit individual blocks to move independently of one another without the whole thing falling apart			1
it took six years to go from prototype to market , but when it finally hit the shelves at the start of the 1980s , it became the fastest selling puzzle of all time			1
it stills retains its appeal to this day			0
last year alone it sold seven million units and so - called " speed cubing " competitions -- where contestants attempt to solve the puzzle against the clock -- are as popular as ever			1
in a rare interview , the publicity - shy @entity21 retraces the journey of his iconic toy			1
@entity0 : what do you think it is about the cube that continues to capture the public imagination ? @entity21 : i believe probably the most characteristic part of the cube is the contradiction between simplicity and complexity			1
i love the simplicity of the cube because it 's a very clear geometrical shape , and i love geometry because it 's the study of how the whole universe is structured			1
i think probably that 's part of the key to the success of the cube -- you are able to have a connection with this order and chaos			1
@entity0 : you had the idea in 1974 and at the time you were a lecturer in interior design , what set you off on this invention ? @entity95 : i was searching to find a good task for my students			1
when you are studying from a book , lots of people go straight to the end to look for the answers			0
but that 's not my style			1
for me , the most enjoyable part is the puzzle , the process of solving , not the solution itself			1
also , we were playing with geometry , which is not a static subject			0
it 's a very mobile thing , it 's changeable			1
so , i was looking for a mobile structure and i found the geometry of a cube very exciting because of the high level of symmetries it has and the fact that you can do a lot of things with it			1
@entity0 : what was the puzzle you were trying to pose ? @entity95 : usually structures are pieces that are connected in some way or another , and usually these connections are stable things			2
so all the time " a " is connected to " @entity144 " but with the structure of the @entity9 , you realize these elements are moving very freely , but you do n't understand what keeps the whole thing together , so that was a very interesting part of it			0
@entity0 : how did you go about building the prototype ? @entity95 : nowadays you 've got three - dimensional printing and @entity147 [ computer - aided design ] programs on computers , but i was working at a very different time			2
there was a workshop in the school , and i just used wood as a material because it is very simple to use and you do n't need any sophisticated machines			0
so i made it just by using my hands -- cutting the wood , drilling holes , using elastic bands and those kind of very simple things			2
@entity0 : how does the internal mechanism actually work ? @entity95 : usually people are surprised by how simple it is , but it is also very difficult to explain			0
so the best way to discover it is to take it apart ! @entity0 : how long did it take you to solve the cube once you 'd created the prototype ? @entity95 : it took more than a month of research , facing the problem , trying to understand it , building up theories , testing them , thinking to myself things like : " i have one side and one turn is 90 degrees and if you turn it four times i 'll be back where i was , " and so on			2
you have to find rules and then you find the law of symmetry , the law of movements			0
@entity0 : do you remember the moment when you solved it ? @entity95 : i remember it was very emotional , but i do n't remember what time it was exactly			2
i do n't make notes on that , and i have no diary about it , but i remember it was a very emotional feeling			0
read : ' @entity202 ' provides a light bulb moment for wireless web but then it 's not something like a jigsaw puzzle where you start to work on it , spend some time on it , and in the end it 's solved , it 's finished			1
if you find a solution with the cube , it does n't mean you find everything			2
it 's only a starting point			2
you can work on and find something else , you can improve your solution , you can make it shorter , you can go deeper and deeper and collect knowledge and many other things			0
@entity0 : what did you do next ? @entity95 : i showed it to the people in the school and my students liked it very much			2
and i had the feeling that because it has very simple structure , it can be manufactured easily and it can be a product that is available for others			0
and so i applied for a patent because i had some experience of my father 's work and he has got several patents			2
after that i was searching to find a manufacturer here in @entity30			1
but the country was a very different place from how it is today			0
we were behind the @entity244 , we had different social circumstances -- so it was not an easy task			2
read : @entity249 inventors flock to @entity250 but i found a small company who was working with plastic - their main line was manufacturing chess sets -- and we started to negotiate			1
@entity0 : did you make any mistakes with the patent application , would you do it differently given what you know now ? @entity95 : you know , there is a @entity30 saying that it 's easy to be clever after the event			1
one problem was the speed of the process because from the beginning to the real marketing [ point ] was six years			0
six years is too long because there is a rule on how you can patent : when you start the process , you need to make the next step within a year , because otherwise you lose the patent			0
but in the end we partly solved the problem because we used my name as a trademark , and this too is a good tool for protection			0
i was lucky because in the @entity287 phone book there is less than five people who have the same name ! @entity0 : what would you advise an inventor now to do to protect themselves ? @entity95 : that 's a very difficult question			2
there are many more protection possibilities than in that time			0
one thing is , you need to find partners , you ca n't do it alone			0
you need professionals ; you need advisers and you need partners who are capable of helping you both on the legal part and also the financial part as well			0
and naturally it is very important to realise you product			0
you can protect your patent but if you do n't develop the product it 's meaningless			2
@entity0 : in a couple of years , it 'll be 40 years old , how do you feel about it ? are you still discovering things about it ? @entity95 : yeah , nowadays my discoveries come from watching the impact of the cube			0
i 'm wondering how people are so creative , and how many things were born out of and inspired by the cube			1
that 's a very interesting thing			0
@entity0 : the final question : are you a good @entity9 player ? @entity95 : i am really not a speedcuber			0
my best time when i was practicing was about a minute			0
usually people say if you can create a piano , you must be a good piano player , but it is not true			0
they are different type of human activities and need different capabilities .			0
