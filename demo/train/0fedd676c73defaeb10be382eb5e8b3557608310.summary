police around the @entity2 are recording the license plates of passing drivers and storing the information for years with little privacy protection , the @entity0 said wednesday			1
the information potentially allows authorities to track the movements of everyone who drives a car			0
the @entity0 documented the police surveillance after reviewing 26,000 pages of material gathered through public records requests to almost 600 local and state police departments in 38 states and the @entity18			1
opinion : @entity20 must protect our privacy from the government police are gathering the vehicle information with surveillance technology called automatic license plate readers , and it 's being stored -- sometimes indefinitely -- with few or no privacy protections , the @entity0 said			1
" the documents paint a startling picture of a technology deployed with too few rules that is becoming a tool for mass routine location tracking and surveillance , " the @entity0 said in a written statement			2
the license plate readers alert police to an automobile associated with an investigation , " but such instances account for a tiny fraction of license plate scans , and too many police departments are storing millions of records about innocent drivers , " the @entity0 said			1
after the crash : license , registration , cellphone , please " private companies are also using license plate readers and sharing the information they collect with police with little or no oversight or privacy protections			1
a lack of regulation means that policies governing how long our location data is kept vary widely , " the @entity0 said			2
the civil liberties group is advocating legislation regulating the use of the technology			0
the readers have been proliferating at " worrying speed " and are typically mounted on bridges , overpasses and patrol cars , the @entity0 said			2
the devices use high - speed cameras , and the software analyzes the photographs to retrieve the plate number , the group said			1
lawsuit by 19 groups seeks to halt @entity78 snooping the system then runs the data against " hot lists " of plate numbers and produces an instant alert when a match , or " hit , " registers , the group said			0
the hot lists include the @entity90 ﬁle , which includes stolen cars and vehicles used in the commission of a crime			0
" license plate readers would pose few civil liberties risks if they only checked plates against hot lists and these hot lists were implemented soundly			2
but these systems are conﬁgured to store the photograph , the license plate number , and the date , time , and location where all vehicles are seen — not just the data of vehicles that generate hits , " the @entity0 report said			1
the growing collection of data allows police to create " a single , high - resolution image of our lives , " and the constant monitoring " can chill the exercise of our cherished rights to free speech and association , " the group said			0
" if not properly secured , license plate reader databases open the door to abusive tracking , enabling anyone with access to pry into the lives of his boss , his ex-wife , or his romantic , political , or workplace rivals , " the @entity0 said			1
law enforcement argues the tools keep officers and the public safe			2
in a blog post last week , the @entity133 said that license plate recognition ( @entity136 ) technology has helped with " literally thousands of cases nationwide			2
" " @entity136 is not an invasion of privacy , but rather a tool for law enforcement to better accomplish its mission to protect and serve			0
the onus is on law enforcement agencies and governing bodies to ensure that they have proper policies in place for disciplined and responsible use , with appropriate punishments for anyone operating outside of policy , " the union said			0
the @entity0 report cited how the @entity155 in 2012 tracked the movement of the mayor @entity158 's car 41 times at a license police reader in the prior year			1
the newspaper put the information on a map and gathered the data through public records requests			0
the newspaper found that the police department 's plate readers yielded hits of fewer than 1 % of the 805,000 plate scans made in june 2012 , according to the @entity0			1
a hit means that a read matched a listing in a database of vehicles law enforcement was interested in , for whatever reason			0
they might be reported stolen , for instance , or belonging to missing persons			0
as a result , the mayor directed the police chief to recommend a new policy on data retention , the group said .			0

@entity0 says technology helps to keep officers and the public safe
police around country track every vehicle passing a license plate reader
the readers are surveillance technology using high speed cameras
there 's little , if any , privacy protection for innocent *motorists* , the @entity0 says
