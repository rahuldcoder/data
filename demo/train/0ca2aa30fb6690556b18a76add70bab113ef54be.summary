-- on tuesday , january 12 2010 , the world watched in horror as @entity3 was struck by a catastrophic earthquake			2
at least 100,000 people lost their lives in the devastation			2
in the aftermath , many people around the world sent financial aid to help support survivors			2
but one young entrepreneur was so affected by the tragedy that he sat down at his desk to try to lend his professional skills to future relief efforts			0
having watched the disaster unfold on tv , @entity17 , a graduate from @entity18 and the @entity19 , began working on a tool that could be used to help in emergency response situations around the world			1
" if you remember the 2010 earthquake in @entity3 , you saw hundreds of thousands of people buried under the rubble			0
after an earthquake most people die in the first 48 hours			0
people who are trapped tend to die in the first 48 hours			0
and the international rescue teams came with their very sophisticated equipment , and did a fantastic job when they got there , ( but ) they did n't get there for 48 hours			1
and their tools , their fiber optic scopes , and all the kinds of equipment that they have , cost $ 50,000 , and are very hard to use			1
so , despite their very valiant efforts , they pulled out a few hundred people , but most of the damage was already done , " @entity17 says			1
the device @entity17 invented is called the @entity47 -- a small black probe about the size of a baseball , fixed with an array of sensors and cameras that can be thrown or dropped into dangerous environments			1
" the initial thought was , how could we create something that was easy to use , that could allow a first responder , or even a volunteer , to easily look inside a space to determine whether it was safe to enter it , to see if there was a victim inside , " @entity17 says			1
" and that moved from search and rescue , to police who often face hostage situations : aggressive shooters , or terrorism			2
to fire fighting applications , where people often want to search different rooms in a complex , before having to enter or decide whether there is a fire or not			0
so there 's a common problem across first responders of having to decide whether to enter a house or a space			2
and we are trying to make it cheap and easy to get images while they are out of there			0
" to develop the product @entity17 partnered with @entity89 , an entrepreneur who spent four and a half years as a @entity91 infantry officer			1
the @entity47 's cameras and sensors can quickly take panoramic images after being thrown into an inaccessible space			1
the impact resistant shell can also house heat sensors , @entity99 counters , vibration antennae or smoke detectors to provide different information in different kinds of emergencies , such as natural distasters or @entity107 hostage rescues			0
the ball then broadcasts its findings back to a mobile device to give users information on whether there are hazards ( or indeed survivors ) around a corner , or buried beneath fallen debris			0
the company , @entity118 , won a gold award of $ 50,000 at @entity120 , and was named one of @entity123 's @entity122 of the year			0
@entity124 , ceo of design consultancy @entity125 , said : " i think that the concept is really great in its simplicity ... there 's a lot of potential there , and there 's a lot of potential for doing good with it , because if you think about , the dangerous world that we live in , we need simple , robust , usable ideas that are embedded in great products			0
" @entity17 hopes to begin producing the @entity47 next year , and says he aims to keep the cost between $ 500 and $ 1000 .			1

@entity143 graduate @entity17 invents *throwable* camera called the @entity47
the shock *absorbent* baseball - sized tool can be thrown into hostile situations to assess risk
it is a low - cost piece of equipment that could help first responders in developing countries
