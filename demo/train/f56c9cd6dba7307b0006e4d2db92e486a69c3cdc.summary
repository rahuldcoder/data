-- @entity2 authorities say that @entity4 leaders ordered followers to behead someone on @entity2 soil as a " demonstration killing			1
" prosecutors say they uncovered a plot that was " clearly designed to shock and horrify " the public			1
now that president @entity13 has announced the @entity12 will seek to degrade and destroy @entity4 , should @entity12 worry they will become targets for similar plots from this ruthless terrorist group ? @entity4 has worked diligently to taunt the @entity12 and its allies			1
the alleged plot in @entity2 , which triggered that country 's largest ever anti-terrorist dragnet , is only the most recent example			1
even before @entity4 became well - known , @entity23 soldier @entity22 was butchered in a @entity25 street last year			2
there is a real possibility that @entity12 , too , will face the threat of such " demonstration killings " on @entity12 soil			2
the news from @entity2 comes on the heels of recent videotaped decapitations of @entity12 journalists @entity34 and @entity36			1
the @entity4 killer mocks the @entity12 president and addresses him personally in the @entity36 video : " i 'm back , @entity13			1
... i remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring out troops back home from @entity46 and @entity47			0
" the militant claims to want an end to @entity12 missile strikes against the group			2
but everything @entity4 does seems to indicate the opposite			2
it 's hard not to escape the impression that @entity4 wants to be attacked by the @entity12 , by its @entity57 allies and by the rest of the world			1
killing @entity12 and broadcasting their beheadings ; slaying a @entity23 citizen the same way ; calling for the deaths of @entity2 in the streets of @entity65 -- these all seem designed to stoke fury in the @entity68 against the @entity70 extremists			1
is @entity4 on a suicide mission ? not really			2
@entity4 wants the @entity12 to join in the fight			1
but that does not mean the @entity12 should ignore the threat			2
@entity13 should deal with @entity4 carefully			2
the group is extremely dangerous and allowing it to continue scoring victories would be disastrous			0
still , @entity4 efforts to draw @entity12 into its vortex are telling			1
@entity4 leader @entity79 believes he has much to gain by turning this into a war between his forces -- whom he perceives as representatives of @entity85 -- and the @entity12 , the most powerful military force in the world			1
@entity88 is trying to enlist a wide - ranging coalition to fight against @entity4 , and it is enlisting other @entity92 - majority @entity91 states to participate			2
it is crucial that @entity4 not be allowed to portray this battle as a war pitting @entity92 against non-muslims			1
it is a fight between a blood - thirsty extremist organization that embraces a brutal interpretation of @entity85 against those who disagree with @entity4 ' goals , methods and ideology			1
the @entity12 is the country with the power to tip the scales , but it is hardly @entity4 ' main enemy			1
as a former @entity4 fighter told @entity0 , " the main and principal goal of the @entity112 that they tell their new members is to establish an @entity85 state that will encompass the @entity91 world , " he said			1
" and after that , we go to other countries			0
" for @entity121 , fighting @entity12 and its coalition of 40 countries is a badge of honor , a powerful recruiting tool			2
it is proof that he and his organization have become the leaders of global jihad , toppling @entity130 , their rival in that contest			0
@entity4 was once part of @entity130 ( it was once called @entity130 in @entity46 ) , but its tactics proved too extreme even for the perpetrators of 9/11 , which predicted public beheadings of @entity92 would turn other @entity92 against the group			1
now @entity4 has become more powerful than @entity130			0
@entity137 has conquered more than @entity138 dared to dream he might do in his lifetime			0
but that does not mean @entity121 did not learn from his former leader			0
as @entity138 explained , " when people see a strong horse , by nature they will like the strong horse			0
" nothing makes for a stronger horse , a more powerful draw in the world of jihad , than fighting @entity12			0
until now , @entity4 has achieved enormous victories , adding to its allure , but these are likely inebriating the group with the poisonous brew of hubris			0
@entity4 has scored battlefield victories against @entity159 government forces , rival @entity159 opposition fighters , the @entity46 military and even the storied @entity164 @entity163 militias			0
by now , @entity121 and his men may be feeling invincible			0
they may believe they have all the power of @entity168 on their side			0
this is where hubris comes in			0
this is where they risk overplaying their hand			0
the killings of @entity34 and @entity36 already jolted the @entity12 public and their war - weary president out of the all - pervasive @entity182 opposition to entering a new conflict in the @entity184			1
@entity4 is a threat that can not be ignored			0
@entity4 ' atrocities in @entity159 , along with all the killing in that country , were receiving little attention until the @entity159 civil war boiled over into @entity46 , and @entity4 swept across the border it says does not exist			1
now that @entity121 and his men have started challenging and defying the @entity68 , they have finally captured attention beyond the @entity184			0
with every step they have taken beyond @entity159 , with every move closer to @entity12 , @entity23 , @entity2 or @entity200 interests , they have given new impetus to international involvement			1
even @entity13 , the most reluctant of commanders in chief , has decided to act			0
for three years , @entity13 had resisted calls to arm @entity159 rebels despite some 200,000 killed in that country 's civil war			0
@entity4 has suddenly changed that equation with its sweep in @entity46 , endangering @entity12 's friends , the @entity212 , threatening genocide against the @entity214 and then ostentatiously killing @entity12 citizens			1
according to @entity2 prime minister @entity217 , officials had firm evidence that an attack on a " random " @entity2 citizen was in the works			2
" this is not just suspicion , " he said			0
the @entity2 people " are at serious risk from a terrorist attack			0
" in @entity121 's calculus , an attack on @entity2 -- or any @entity227 -- would produce propaganda and recruiting gains			0
@entity4 is gambling that drawing @entity12 and the @entity68 into the fight will make it stronger , but if the @entity68 is strategic and smart , this move will prove to be @entity4 ' worst mistake .			1
