@entity1 , @entity0 -- while many films spend a brief period in the spotlight before fading into obscurity , there are some which seem to grow increasingly powerful over time			0
@entity10 stars in " @entity11 " as @entity12 , a young girl who changes everyone 's lives when she reveals her connection to the @entity16			1
lost @entity18 classic " @entity11 , " is one such film that looks set for a revival over two decades after it was first released			1
web site users voted to award the late @entity18 director @entity22 's film the top prize in the @entity25 for @entity26 , edging @entity27 's acknowledged classic " @entity29 " into second place			1
this comes as a late but significant accomplishment for the film which was made in 1982			1
" @entity11 " has won numerous awards in its native @entity18 and remains the first and only @entity18 film to have been shown in competition at the prestigious @entity37			1
" @entity11 , " which means " miracle " in the @entity18 language @entity42 , tells the story of a poor provincial girl named @entity12 who claims to have seen the @entity16 and then demonstrates the ability to cure the sick			2
she takes on the persona of a saint , and her sudden fame brings about a rush of changes in her community , for both better and worse			0
scriptwriter @entity51 , based his story on a real incident on @entity54 , in @entity55 , @entity18			1
in the late 1960s , reports of a young girl who had experienced visions of the @entity16 attracted salvation - seeking pilgrims and curious tourists in droves			0
@entity51 wanted to create an unflinching depiction of the place of faith and religion in desperate and unforgiving times			2
producer @entity69 's first impression of the script was that the subject matter hit close to home for the @entity18 , who are mostly @entity73			0
" this was a representation of how much faith really runs in the blood of the @entity18 , " he said , " we 're a very poor country and i think it 's such a relief for us to know that this strong faith in each one of us is [ what 's ] guiding us and propelling us to face all the challenges			0
" @entity51 and @entity22 also collaborated closely , continuing to work on @entity51 's original script , reworking the film 's characters to make them as real as possible			1
filming was completed in just a month in the arid , desolate area of @entity90 in the northern @entity18 , on a meager budget of just over $ 60,000			0
@entity93 locals with no acting experience were hired as extras to cut costs , and @entity51 remembers them as a genuinely wretched bunch who " knew how it was to suffer " and " to pray for a miracle			2
" @entity51 had insisted on having actress @entity10 , who was 29 - years - old at the time , in the lead role			2
apart from the rising star 's talent , he saw parallels with @entity12 in her			0
" her relationship with her fans was almost like the relationship of @entity12 with her followers in the film and so i thought that it was a very strange and mysterious , " says @entity51			1
and to add a supernatural twist to the film 's history , @entity10 says that she had dreamt of the @entity16 on the night before the part of @entity12 was offered to her			2
since then @entity10 has become one of the @entity18 ' biggest superstars , though " @entity11 " is still considered her finest work			2
your say : which classic movies do you think should be resurrected ? tell us below in the @entity120 box			0
in her character 's final speech in " @entity11 " , which both @entity51 and @entity124 say is their favorite scene , she resolutely confesses to a motley crowd of worshippers that " there is no miracle			1
" after telling the people to seek the truth within themselves , she is assassinated by a faceless follower			0
" long after the film was shown , i would talk to university students and they would always ask , ' so , who killed @entity12 ? ' " says @entity51 of the climactic ending , which underwent several on - set rewrites			1
" and i always tell them that in the end , we killed her			0
in the end , we killed @entity12			0
in the end , people could not bear to hear the truth from her because they wanted to survive			0
" @entity51 believes the film 's message is still relevant today , particularly for @entity18 , because it confronts how easily people attach their faith to almost anything they think might ease their suffering in times of hardship and despair			1
whatever it is that audiences see in " @entity11 's " unique story , it would certainly seem that it is finally gaining the recognition it deserves .			1
