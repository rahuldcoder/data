-- the week of hellish @entity2 travel is almost upon us , when news crews will descend upon airports everywhere for their epic updates from the front line : " breaking , breaking ! the airport is really crowded , you guys ! " those reporters are correct : before we can lapse into that tryptophan - laced food coma with family and friends , we must travel			1
and since @entity2 is secular and more or less universally observed , we must do it en masse			1
last year , the @entity16 estimated that 42.5 million @entity17 traveled 50 miles or more from home at @entity2			1
that 's a lot of little dotted lines on the map of the @entity17 of @entity22 whether you 're arriving by train or ( more likely ) plane or automobile , you 're bound to encounter some headaches			1
and as this column 's existence shows , we are nothing if not rude , crabby , shouty beings when challenged , funneling our rage into our various social networks			1
ahoy , travelers : take a deep breath and vow now to follow these netiquette tips en route			2
hit the road unjacked that was kind of a play on the @entity46 song and mostly a plea to please , for the love of @entity49 , unplug if you 're the driver			2
that means no talking on your cell , no texting and no looking at your smartphone for any other purpose			1
even if you think you 're a @entity57 multitasker and you have a really spiffy - looking hands - free earpiece ( @entity60 : it 's not actually spiffy - looking ) , you 're incorrect , and you 're putting pedestrians and drivers alike in danger			2
research has demonstrated that people talking on cell phones drive as badly as drunks			2
and those really terrifying texting can wait commercials demonstrate why looking away from the road and engaging your fingers is even stupider			1
it is n't just teenagers treating the driver 's seat as communication central ; 91 % of teens have seen their parents talk on the phone while driving , and 59 % have seen them text , a recent survey from @entity82 and @entity83 reported			1
complain productively if you 're scheduled to fly home ( or , well , anywhere ) for the holidays , you already know that you 're pretty much screwed if weather , technical malfunctions or striking airline employees force a cancellation			2
you also know that calling an airline 's reservation line when that happens can mean hours of waiting -- or getting disconnected over and over again			2
instead of jotting a lengthy and cuss - riddled diatribe on social media , try tweeting , simply and clearly , at the airline itself			0
airlines pay attention to @entity100 , and some are able to actually rebook customers and direct message them a confirmation			0
at the very least , getting a sympathetic tweet back might help			0
@ @entity106 and @ @entity107 have great reputations for getting stuff done			0
treat the terminal like a library that is , shut up			0
there 's nothing more annoying than being trapped with your suitcase at a bus , train or plane terminal directly across from a gabber bellowing into his cell phone about meetings and acquisitions and equity and other such things			0
if you 're going to talk on the phone , make like a polite smoker and choose a corner or nook , lower your head in shame and exhale into the corner , not the crowd , keeping the ( noise ) pollution to a minimum			0
heed the flight attendants ' directives actually turn off your personal electronic devices			1
the @entity143 is serious about this ; even in airplane mode , little bleepy things just might interact with equipment , they say			0
i know it feels like soooo much work to have to hold the button down and then slide your finger across the front , but , you know			0
do n't bug anyone 's work e-mail no matter how brilliant the business insight you had during your fourth glass of @entity161 , it 's not worth logging in to your work account			0
this is the one time of year we 9 - to - 5ers get a food - filled four - day weekend all at the same time			1
it 's what the pilgrims and native americans would have wanted .			0

last year , 42.5 million @entity17 went 50 miles or more for @entity2
when driving , try to " unjack " your electronics . no texting !
be *courteous* with your electronic use when flying , and respect those around you
