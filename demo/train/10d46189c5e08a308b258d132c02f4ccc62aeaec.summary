@entity0 always had the teaching bug in him			0
after graduating from @entity2 in 2002 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science , he turned down industry jobs to teach in the @entity6			2
a few years later he got a masters degree in education from @entity9 and then went to @entity10 to work as a software developer			0
but he could n't stop teaching			0
before he arrived at the office every morning , @entity0 drove to a nearby high school and taught first - period computer science			1
he told colleagues and friends about his experience and recruited them to teach in local schools			0
in 2009 @entity0 launched @entity20 in @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , an initiative that places high - tech professionals as part - time teachers in high schools			1
@entity0 's goal was to see to it that every high school in the country has a computer - science course			1
he thought he might need to quit his job to manage the growing effort			0
but he did n't have to			0
@entity10 offered to support @entity0 , asking him to devote all his workday time to it			0
the company 's decision to incubate the @entity22 program stems partly from founder @entity40 's longstanding interest in promoting education , @entity10 's broader philanthropic focus and a pressing , industry - wide need for more engineers			1
" @entity45 produces the best computer engineers in the world , " said @entity0 , " but we just do n't have enough			1
" which is why @entity22 has over 100 volunteers covering 35 schools in seven states , and is now mounting a big push in @entity53			1
falling behind ? in february of this year , @entity40 joined @entity55 's @entity54 and other tech titans in a video by nonprofit @entity58 to encourage interest among young people in programming			2
demand for top tech talent also has prompted the industry to lobby the @entity65 to give out more @entity67 visas to highly skilled foreign - born immigrants			2
in april , @entity54 penned an op - ed in the @entity69 calling for revised immigration policies so that @entity45 companies can better attract the most talented foreign - born computer scientists			1
computer science is the third highest - paying bachelor degree , right behind computer engineering and chemical engineering			1
while the average starting salary for computer science college graduates is $ 64,400 , industry insiders frequently cite higher figures			2
in large or competitive companies like @entity82 or @entity55 , starting salary for the cream of the crop college graduates is nearly $ 100,000 , not counting bonuses or stock options			0
despite the financial appeal , there are n't enough computer programmers entering the @entity45 workforce to fill the estimated 150,000 new computing jobs that will be produced every year for the next decade			1
this adds to anxiety among industry professionals and policy leaders that the @entity45 could fall behind other countries in innovation if it does n't foster education in @entity100 ( science , technology , engineering and math )			1
part of the problem is that the @entity45 lacks enough computer science teachers , said @entity0			1
recent graduates with a computer science degree are far more likely to go into the tech industry , where offers are more lucrative			1
early exposure to computer science can lead students to develop an aptitude or liking for the subject , apply for opportunities like tech internships , and pursue it as a career path			1
but even as technology becomes an integral part of most people 's lives , fewer computer - science courses are being offered in high schools			1
perhaps as a result , computer - science tests account for just 0.69 % of all high school @entity131 tests taken			1
and yet knowledge of computer programming is becoming more critical in the workplace			0
" computer science is permeating every industry and every field , and its importance will only grow , " said @entity0			2
" whether it 's biology , finance , architecture , or a host of other disciplines , a basic computer literacy is critical			2
" @entity22 in @entity53 that the @entity45 produces so few graduates in a field that will grow in importance makes the demand - supply problem only more urgent			1
@entity53 mayor @entity148 , never one to shy away from national issues , tried in 2011 to jumpstart the city 's tech scene with the proposal to build a world - class engineering campus			1
when the mayor 's office heard about @entity22 after the @entity157 ran an article about it in fall 2012 , officials reached out to @entity0 and asked him to bring the program to @entity53			1
with help from the mayor 's @entity161 , @entity22 began setting up and recruiting volunteers			1
in march , @entity0 appeared at a @entity53 tech meetup to invite the city 's tech community to get involved			2
a plug from venture capitalist and blogger @entity169 also helped generate interest			0
interviews with applicants , conducted jointly with nine participating high schools , started this month			1
@entity0 is curious to see how the composite of the volunteer force shapes up since few major technology companies are headquartered in @entity53			0
selected volunteers will go through an intensive training program in the summer so that they can use a standardized curriculum and learn how to manage classrooms by the fall			2
since tech professionals often have flexible working hours , the program places them in first - period classes , which usually ends shortly after 9 a.m. volunteers are paid a small stipend to cover transportation costs			1
but as @entity0 put it , " no one is doing this for the money			0
" @entity193 , a @entity10 employee , began teaching at a @entity195 school last september and tries to appeal to students ' creativity			0
" if there is one thing we try to avoid in our class , it is ( being ) boring			0
we often try to show how deeply computer science has altered our world , " he said			2
" we even have some students who plan to code artistic projects			0
i think @entity208 was spot on when he called computer science a liberal art. " bad numbers , big gains about 80 % of @entity22 ' volunteers are @entity10 employees , part of a push by the company to address the dearth of engineering talent in the @entity45 the program is also part of the @entity224 initiative , which seeks to provide better access to education for young people worldwide			1
for @entity228 , ceo and founder of the @entity21 in the @entity231 , area , @entity22 was a boon			0
" we were excited that it could help us identify extremely qualified teachers to staff a very difficult field , " he said			0
" we specifically pushed for @entity100 courses in our schools			0
kids are judged on ability , and the ability to code is going to help them a long way in tomorrow 's world			0
" the numbers suggest @entity0 has an uphill battle			0
in 2012 , only 61 students took advanced - placement computer science in the entire state of @entity249 , for example			1
in the nation 's capital , it 's the same number			0
but @entity0 is taking an optimistic view			0
" the numbers are so bad that anything we can do is a huge , huge gain , " he told @entity255			0
@entity0 needs more students like @entity261 , a senior taking a @entity22 @entity131 course at @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity231 , who said , " it is a dream of mine to someday work as a software engineer or programmer graphic artist in video games			2
" what would really help , @entity0 said , is if states recognized computer science as a core requirement rather than an elective			2
" it really should be the fourth science course in high school , right beside biology , physics and chemistry , " he said			0
" if the next generation in this country is going to compete successfully for 21st - century jobs , they 're going to need to know computer science			2

the @entity22 program seeks to develop more computer - science students in the @entity45
the @entity45 has a shortage of qualified computer engineers
despite tech 's growing role in society , few high schools offer computer - science classes
@entity22 now has over 100 volunteers covering 35 schools in seven states
