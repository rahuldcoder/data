@entity0 , @entity1 -- there have n't been many times when i have been at a loss for words when conducting an interview as a medical reporter			1
this was one of those moments			1
the man cleared his throat , after ignoring the question i just asked him			1
" you want to know what i think ? " he said loudly			1
" i do , " i replied			1
" is that what this is about -- you want to know how i really feel , what makes me tick ? " he said even louder			1
i nodded as calmly as i could			1
" let me tell you something , " his voice trailed off			1
he paused and looked momentarily distracted			2
he gave a long , hard look at his lawyer , who was standing right behind me			2
he shivered a little bit and bunched up his powder blue sweater			2
" i have no regrets , none whatsoever , " he said			2
it was windy outside , but it was also over 90 degrees in sunny @entity0 , @entity1			2
i was now sweating , and he was ... well , cold			2
he shifted his gaze from his lawyer back to me			2
" @entity34 , you want to know the single worst moment of my life ? " that was n't the question i asked , but in fact i was curious to know the answer			2
" ok , " i replied -- a little uneasily			2
he smiled now and said in a very deliberate , almost staccato voice : " the single worst moment of my life ... was the moment i was born			2
" and , we had officially begun my sit - down interview with dr @entity46			1
we were in @entity0 because we both attended the @entity47			2
i graduated in 1993 and the 82 - year - old @entity46 in 1952			1
we found his class picture in a long hallway connecting the medical school to the @entity51			2
as he shuffled toward the picture , he leaned in to me and said , " i am not a sentimental person			2
" still , he had a glimmer in his eye when he identified the younger and more handsome version of himself			2
i was about to ask him about the other members of his class , when he started pointing at various student pictures			2
" dead ... dead , dead , " he repeated over and over			2
he was bringing me up to date on the status of his classmates			2
" dead , dead , " he paused and cracked a smile			2
" this guy here ... he wanted me in jail			2
" i looked over , pointed , and asked , " this guy ? " " no.			2
. but , he probably did as well , " @entity46 replied			1
he then laughed and shuffled off again down the hallway			2
i did n't know what to expect when i was planning this interview			0
i had read everything i could find about him , including two books he had written while in prison			0
i had watched the documentary that will premiere june 28 on @entity74 and the recent docudrama with @entity76 , for which , he told me , he received " not a penny			0
" he lives in a small apartment in @entity81 and has recently adopted a caloric - restriction diet , eating around 500 calories a day , he says			0
@entity46 had sprung onto the national scene right about the time i was starting medical school			1
he fascinated my parents , and during the rare occasions i attended a cocktail party with them , the conversation among their friends seemed to always turn to him			0
he invoked strong emotions in so many people he had never met			1
" during your interview for medical school , right there in that building , when they asked you , ' why do you want to be a doctor ? ' what did you answer ? " i asked			0
" what did you answer ? " he replied somewhat harshly			0
throughout the two - and - a - half hour interview , he fluctuated wildly between being downright combative and hostile to being sweet and fatherly			0
it was almost as if he desperately wanted me to understand all the decisions he had made in his life			0
by this point , i knew he was just asking me rhetorically , so i waited patiently for him to collect himself			0
" i told them all the stuff they wanted to hear			0
oh , i want to heal people and i want to join medicine , because it is the noblest of all professions ... noble , yeah right			1
" " is medicine a noble profession ? " i continued			0
" what do you think ? " he once again fired back			0
" no , it is not , " he finally answered			0
dr. @entity46 is as opaque a person as i have ever met			1
but despite his crazed rants -- often about the @entity124 to the @entity125 , complete with a defense of @entity127 and trashing of @entity128 ( that guy ... he just took all the credit ! ) -- @entity46 still knows how to make a point			1
not surprisingly , he strongly advocates assisted suicide , or euthanasia , or what he calls " patholysis			1
" terms matter to @entity46 , and this is the term he prefers when describing the " medical procedure " he performed on at least 130 people , by his own count			1
" path means disease or suffering , " he said to me			1
" and lysis , means destruction , " i said			1
" exactly , " he answered			0
as we walked around campus , @entity46 drew a lot of attention			1
many stopped to say hello , ask for an autograph or take a picture			0
he spent time with every person , asking about them and their role at the university			0
it was about an hour into the interview when i realized @entity46 was trying to make a broader point			1
it started when i cited a study about the people he had " patholysed			1
" " it says here that in at least five of the people , there was no evidence of any disease on autopsy			1
" i let that hang in the air for a second			0
he seemed a little stunned that i had found this study			0
he shook his head slightly , and looked again at his lawyer , with no intention of addressing the point i had just made			0
" recently , i had three former ceos of companies -- perfectly healthy -- who called me up and told me they wish to die			1
" he let that sink in			0
it was my turn to be stunned			0
" so ... what did you do ? what did you tell them ? " i asked gently			0
" no , nothing , " he said with a dismissive wave of his hand			0
" i did n't do anything , but people have their rights			1
" i realized this was what he had building up to for some time			0
this was n't just about assisted suicide ; this was about upholding the ability for people to do whatever they wanted to do , without interference from doctors , the states or the federal government			1
that the rights of the masses should not impede on the rights of a few			0
someone once told me that was the " gist " of the @entity124 , and it is something that has helped inform dr. @entity46 's thinking and his life			1
turns out he did have some regrets , which he told me about			0
he wishes he 'd treated his parents better , and his sister , he said quietly			0
he also is deeply resentful that the @entity217 never heard his case , which he felt was a constitutional one			1
" that is what they are for ! " for a moment , i had finally penetrated inside the head of @entity46 , and it was a lucid , well thought - out , and somewhat frightening place to be			1
and , perhaps he was right about @entity127 as well -- he really did n't get enough credit for contributing to the @entity125			0
" in times of desperation , people may make decisions they regret , " i started up again			1
" this is n't about deciding whether you want frozen yogurt or ice cream			0
these decisions about patholysis are ... forever			1
" he agreed with that point , but quickly pointed out that he obtained mental health exams on all of his patients before agreeing to proceed			0
he also thoroughly reviewed medical records -- about what he was looking for exactly , he was less forthcoming			0
fact is , he says he turned down " many " patients who had requested his services			0
and , for what it is worth , he never charged			0
a family member had once sent repeated checks to him after @entity46 assisted in his wife 's suicide , and he kept sending the money back , he told me			1
i did ask @entity46 about his reflections on his own mortality			1
" i am not ready to die , " he answered			1
" i have purpose in my life and three missions , " he added			0
he wants to tell mankind about " impending doom			0
" he worries that our culture of overabundance will soon lead to the extinction of the human race			0
" i am not going to be too popular for that one			0
" his second mission is to educate people about patholysis			1
" they just do n't get it in @entity272 , " he said			0
" or in @entity273 or @entity274 , the other states , " where assisted suicide has been legalized			1
in those states , a person has to be considered terminal in order to qualify for assisted suicide			1
" what difference does it make if someone is terminal ? " he said			0
" we are all terminal			0
" his third mission is to convince the @entity286 public that their rights are infringed upon each and every day -- and that the @entity124 is not being upheld			0
everything from banning smoking in public places , to assisted suicide , euthanasia and patholysis			1
by the end of the interview , dr @entity46 was smiling a lot and thanking me for spending a day with him			1
he was back to the paternal , friendly @entity46			1
we shook hands , and he hung on for a few extra seconds , looked me in the eyes and said , " thank you @entity34			0
" i told him it was an honor to meet him , and hoped to see him again soon			0
as he shuffled away , i could n't help but think @entity46 still invoked strong emotions in people -- but i also hoped that if the moment of his birth was the worst of his life that he had some good moments since then			1
