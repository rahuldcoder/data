-- she is only 37 years old , but violinist @entity2 has already spent 25 years taking center - stage with the world 's best orchestras			1
@entity2 first hit center - stage when she was just 11 - years - old			1
born into a musical family in @entity8 , @entity9 , in 1971 -- her mother and brother are both accomplished musicians -- her own prodigious talents were spotted at an early age by @entity15 , the conductor and one - time musical director of the @entity17			1
inviting @entity2 to play with the @entity17 in 1982 , he helped to propel her onto the world stage which has been such a large part of her life ever since			1
she moved to @entity22 to study at the @entity23 of performing arts and has lead a life entwined with music			2
unlike some prodigiously talented people there is no hint of resentment directed toward her and the life she has led			2
nor is there any notion of a stolen childhood , despite her admission that she did harbor dreams of being all sorts of other things , from an archeologist or diplomat to a zookeeper or a nun			2
" this was my life , i did n't know any other			0
i took it and i was very happy			0
being a child performer opened up opportunities			1
from a fairly early age i was exposed to different cultures and was traveling round the world			1
it was a great education , " she told @entity0			1
being given the opportunity to learn more about different people and experience different places was only one part of this education			2
while @entity2 has been practicing and honing her own skills , she has also been given the opportunity to give something back			1
in 1992 she set up @entity60 , a non-profit organization that brings musical education to young people in @entity22			1
" i was always interested in education ; not just receiving , but also helping others and being part of the community , " she said			2
from @entity60 came @entity68 , a similar organization in @entity9 , offering programs in public schools and children 's hospitals			1
while continuing to perform across the world with renowned orchestras she took some time out to further her own education with a degree in psychology in 2000 and in 2005 received her masters in @entity81 from @entity82			1
but music is and remains her first love and the way in which it connects people and stirs emotions is something she believes is one of the most powerful aspects of music			0
the world today might be unrecognizable from the world of @entity95 or @entity96 , but for @entity2 the way people feel and respond to music and emotions remains the same			1
" the very basics of being human has n't changed			0
we may express ourselves differently , but the fact we do respond and do feel that is something very basic , " she said			0
and while there are hardships involved in being one of the world 's finest violinists , it still remains a pure pleasure			2
" as musicians we 're trained to be self critical so we can get better			0
but fundamentally we love music			0
it 's a love that drives us to practice and keep working at it			0
it 's something i love so much and gives me so much joy			0
" with that comes hardships ... there 's never a state of perfection			0
you try and you try and you try , but at the end you know you ca n't be perfect			0
it 's humbling , so that it becomes a motivating force , " she told @entity0			0
continuing her work outside of the concert hall , @entity2 was made a @entity133 in 2007 , a role she relishes			1
while it presents her additional opportunities to talk about issues close to her heart , it 's also a position that nourishes her inquisitive mind and another means to connect with people indirectly through her music			0
these experiences make the world a little more vivid than it was before			2
and i 'm grateful for that ; it 's also something that motivates me to continue to do it , " she said .			0
