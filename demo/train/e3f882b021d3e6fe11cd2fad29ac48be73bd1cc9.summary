-- " @entity3 " ballet , as most @entity2 know it , is about magic			1
a wooden toy transforms into a prince , mice and toy soldiers engage in battle , a little girl journeys to a sugar - coated paradise where she is treated to a series of decadent dances			0
but does it need more magic , @entity17 director @entity16 wondered , prompting a search for ways to make his company 's version of the classic @entity25 staging of the ballet more " magical			1
" " i 've always felt the magic in ' @entity3 ' was rather bland , and that if we could get a real first - class magician to come in and help us figure out how we could enhance the show , it would really take the whole ballet and kick it up a notch , " said @entity16			1
" the whole thing is about magic , it 's @entity41 's dream , so the more magical we make it , the better , " he said , watching a dancer attached to cables float across the stage of @entity37 's @entity36 during final rehearsals last month			0
from @entity43 to @entity44 with love : teaching ' @entity3 ' in the @entity47 it was no small feat , but after months of planning and rehearsing with @entity52 illusionist @entity51 , the show opened earlier this month featuring a levitating ballerina , flying @entity54 and a few other surprises			1
the company also invested in glittering new sets for the first time since its inaugural " @entity3 " production in 2001			1
in a career spanning nearly five decades as a dancer , teacher and company director , @entity16 has played all the male nutcracker roles except @entity65			0
therefore , he was sensitive to concerns that introducing special effects would turn the show into @entity52 - style fare			1
those concerns were put to rest as soon as rehearsals began , the dancers said			0
" they 're not flashy tricks or people doing gymnastics			0
they 're illusions that add to the story at just the right moments , " principal dancer @entity76 said			0
" the story is intact , the choreography is the same , it just adds that element of visual wonder			0
" as the cash cow that allows many ballet companies to pursue projects with less mainstream appeal the rest of the year , " @entity3 " productions are constantly being refreshed and marketed in different ways to bring in larger crowds			1
@entity17 's use of illusions might represent this season 's most substantial modification of an existing production , but each company has its own means of reaching bigger audiences			1
@entity101 continued its tradition of guest walk - ons during its saturday performance with @entity106 mayor @entity105 , who dressed as a @entity43 @entity108 doll and shot a cannon into the audience to begin the battle scene in @entity112 the @entity113 's @entity3 was broadcast tuesday in movie theaters nationwide			1
morning talk show personality @entity115 hosted the live broadcast , which included backstage interviews and a visit to the @entity120 , the official school of the @entity113 and home to the young ballet students who perform in the production			2
a nationally televised broadcast followed on wednesday evening on @entity126 ' " @entity125			0
" other companies organize extra events and activities to enhance their " @entity3 " experience			1
attendees of the @entity133 's production , a collaboration between choreographer @entity133 and illustrator @entity135 , can also enjoy a family brunch or a " date night , " take their pictures with characters from the show or meet the @entity141			2
not everyone in the arts world regards " @entity3 " as a tradition worth embracing			2
in a 2009 @entity149 column , @entity147 wrote that " to those of us who despair of its pervading tweeness and wish ballet had something better to do at this time of year than endlessly reminisce like a sweet , whiskery auntie , it bears some bad news , too			0
' the @entity3 's ' stranglehold is all but squeezing ballet dry			1
" regardless , companies in small cities like @entity44 rely on their adaptations of @entity163 's book " @entity162 " to introduce ballet to audiences that would n't attend otherwise			1
amid the country 's economic slump , " @entity3 " ticket sales have gone down each year , making each investment all the more crucial , @entity16 said			2
" @entity17 's still an esoteric form to many , and for many , they do n't go to see @entity17 , they go to see ' @entity3 , ' " he said			1
" because we do n't have money , every decision we make is that much harder			0
we have to take a hard look at what we gain , " he said			0
" do we spend an extra $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 on lighting to get it at its highest level , or should we get a new snow machine because it 's not putting out as much as i 'd like ? " @entity16 brought the idea of adding special effects to his board and convinced them that a little bit of magic was what they needed to get ticket sales back to pre-recession levels			0
he enlisted the aid of @entity51 , a @entity52 headliner known for incorporating tigers , birds and dancing into his long - running act			1
@entity16 sent a video of the ballet with thoughts on where illusions could possibly fit in			2
from the start , he was firm that @entity51 ' stunts could not alter the choreography or the music			2
they ended up with a dancing doll who floats a few feet above a table and dancers who suddenly pop out of empty boxes			0
the key was to create illusions that were convincing but easy for someone who 's not a " true magician " to pull off , he said			2
from there , the dancers had to learn to interact with the stunts and engage the audience			0
" i 'm overwhelmed to see how great the show turned out and how far the dancers have come , " he said			0
" people think you have to go to @entity52 to see great talent but it 's right here in @entity229			2
