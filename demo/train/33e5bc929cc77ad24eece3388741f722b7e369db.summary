-- @entity2 needs to change its law in the wake of a scandal over alleged child sexual abuse by a then - member of @entity9 's football coaching team , the governor said sunday			1
a new law is needed to make sure reports of alleged child sexual abuse are made to government authorities , @entity10 said			1
" should the law be changed ? absolutely , " @entity10 said on @entity17 's " @entity16			1
" @entity10 was the attorney general who began an investigation of former @entity9 defensive coordinator @entity19			2
a 23 - page grand jury report released last weekend described crimes that @entity19 allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus , both during and after his tenure at at @entity9			0
@entity19 's attorney , @entity25 , has said that his client disputes the report			0
in 2002 , a graduate assistant allegedly saw @entity19 raping a boy in the showers of a campus athletics facility			0
the graduate student , @entity32 , informed @entity33 , the team 's coach at the time , according to the grand jury report			1
@entity33 then alerted his boss , the school 's athletic director			2
it was years before law enforcement first learned about the allegation			1
@entity9 athletic director @entity42 and senior vice president for finance and business @entity43 have been charged for failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading investigators			0
prosecutors determined that a legal duty to report the alleged abuse applied to them , but not to @entity32 and @entity33			1
members of both political parties " have already introduced measures " to change the law , @entity10 said when asked about @entity33			1
" and we have to make sure that the change in the law is one that is effective			0
it 's easy enough to take a look to see what other states have done			0
but i 'm sure that within the next few weeks , you will probably see bills become public			0
" i would n't be surprised to see if a bill was passed between now and the end of this year , " he said			2
@entity32 , who was later promoted to a full - time assistant coach , eventually described the alleged incident in graphic detail to the grand jury			2
he was placed on administrative leave friday			0
the grand jury report says that @entity74 and @entity42 were " senior staff " of the university			0
" @entity2 's mandatory reporting statute for suspected child abuse ... provides that when a staff member reports abuse ... the person in charge of the school or institution has the responsibility and legal obligation to report or cause such a report to be made by telephone and in writing within 48 hours " to the @entity87 , according to the report			1
" an oral report should have been made to the @entity91 , " it said			0
@entity2 's @entity92 states that anyone who , in the course of employment , " comes into contact with children shall report or cause a report to be made ... when the person has reasonable cause to suspect " that the child is a victim of abuse			1
the law states that when the person is required to report " as a member of the staff of a medical or other public or private institution , school , facility or agency , that person shall immediately notify the person in charge			0
" the person in charge ultimately has the responsibility to report the alleged incident to government authorities			0
@entity113 , a prominent @entity114 attorney who represents victims of abuse but is not currently representing anyone involved in the @entity9 scandal , told @entity0 sunday a new law is needed to state that " if you eyewitness the abuse , you have a direct obligation to go to law enforcement			1
" legal analyst @entity124 told @entity0 that when @entity33 told his boss and no report was given to the authorities , " that is where they failed			1
that 's where they fall down on the job			0
" there is also speculation that @entity2 's whistle - blower laws may apply to , and protect , @entity32			1
legal analyst and civil rights attorney @entity138 said the case highlights the need for " a re-examination of what is called the mandatory reporter law			2
" " the argument being advanced in @entity2 is that as long as you tell the boss , you 're covered			2
and that 's where -- i think if we zero in on the issue -- where the problem is			0
if victims are going to be protected , you have to go to law enforcement , and that did n't happen here , " @entity138 said			1
outside of the legal concerns , many question why @entity32 did not stop what he allegedly saw happening in the showers in 2002			1
" how does @entity32 , a 28 - year - old grad student , look in the showers of a facility and see a grown man raping a 10 - year - old child and not instinctively grab a baseball bat and not protect this child ? how does he live with himself ? " asked @entity167 , legal analyst and criminal defense attorney			1
before announcing his administrative leave , the university said @entity32 would not coach @entity9 's saturday football game against @entity172 due to " multiple threats			2
" the newspaper @entity174 reported friday that @entity32 told players on a brief conference call that he was in " protective custody " at a secluded location			2
@entity33 , meanwhile , was fired last week			2
the school 's board of trustees also ousted @entity181 , the school president , who had initially voiced support for @entity42 and @entity74 following the release of the grand jury report			0
@entity10 , who now serves as a trustee on the @entity9 board , made the rounds on three sunday political talk shows , though he cautioned that his comments were limited by legal obligations due to the ongoing investigation			1
asked by " @entity192 " how the school could have allowed @entity19 's alleged activities to continue for years , @entity10 said , " what i saw was a failure to act , and i always have said your actions speak louder than your words			2
" @entity201 presidential hopeful rep. @entity200 , who happened to appear on " @entity16 " after @entity10 , was asked about the scandal			1
" if that was my child , " she said of the allegations , her " automatic reaction would be , even though i 'm a small woman , i 'd want to go find that guy and beat him to a pulp			1
" but @entity200 said the case belongs within the state 's jurisdiction , and that she does not see a role for @entity213 in the response			0
on saturday , tens of thousands packed @entity9 's football stadium , cheering the @entity217 for the first time since the graphic allegations rocked the university and led to the ouster of longtime coach @entity33 , who until days ago was a beloved school icon and the winningest coach in top - level college football history			0
@entity9 lost to @entity172 17 - 14			0
@entity0 's @entity224 contributed to this report .			0

new : a new law should require a witness to tell law enforcement , a @entity2 legal *expert* says
gov. @entity10 : a new law may pass by the end of the year
prosecutors have not charged @entity32 or @entity33
@entity200 : if someone raped her child , she 'd " want to beat him to a pulp "
