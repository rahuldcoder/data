-- in an age where planes travel at record speeds and @entity5 gives visuals of every nook and cranny in the @entity9 , it may seem like the spirit of adventure and exploration that characterized the @entity13 has gone the way of the @entity15			1
but along the @entity17 outside of @entity18 , that spirit remains afire , accessible to anyone with a car and the heart of a cowboy			1
the @entity17 is a 40 - mile circular road winding through the @entity24			1
originally used as a migration route by the @entity27 , it eventually became a stagecoach route and now a scenic drive			1
although scenic may be too tame a description			2
known for being one of the most treacherous routes in the @entity34 , the road curves through steep mountainous terrain , surrounded by bush and cacti and a limited number of gas stations			2
adding to the treachery , a segment of the trail remains unpaved between @entity43 and @entity44			1
this patch of narrow road slithers through some of the most spectacular scenery on the trail , but can be dangerous and is not recommended for large vehicles , including @entity51 , caravans , and some suvs			2
( if renting a vehicle , check that the company allows your particular car to travel down this portion of the trail			0
) paved or unpaved , a trip along the trail is a worthwhile expedition for anyone wanting a @entity13 adventure in the 21st century			1
check out these must - see stops : lost @entity66 visitors at the first stop along the @entity17 might expect to meet @entity69 or @entity70 ambling with guns in their hip holsters through cacti and inhaling the @entity75 dry air			1
but it 's @entity77 whose name is famous here			1
known as the @entity77 -- though historical records indicate he hailed from @entity82 -- @entity83 claimed to find a gold mine hidden in the @entity24 , but he refused to reveal its location and no one has located it since his death in 1891			0
today , those in search of a fortune continue to traverse @entity93 in search of the mine			0
a handful have died in their quest			0
but for many others , the hiking trails provide an opportunity to explore the unique natural wonders of the @entity75 desert			1
the park maintains hiking trails of varying difficulties as well as camping and rv sites for those wanting to spend the night			0
@entity110 @entity110 is a restored ghost town settled by miners a century ago			1
tourists can take a tour of the old mine , sift for gold , dine at the saloon -- surrounded by antler and buffalo heads -- or amble down @entity120 to @entity122 's " family friendly " bordello museum and @entity123			1
be sure to sample some of the root beer fudge and prickly pear cactus fudge at the @entity127 for a soda - shop - meets - @entity13 kind of treat			1
gunfights occur hourly on weekends between noon and 4 p.m. , and weddings can be held at the town church			0
@entity133 it 's a curious sight to round a bend on the @entity17 and find a 950 - acre lake nestled in the desert valley			1
that 's because @entity133 was formed as a result of the @entity140 , which was completed in 1925			2
today , the lake is a welcome oasis from the oppressive hot and dry air that characterizes the @entity144			2
visitors to @entity133 may swim , sunbathe on the beach or rent a boat at the @entity148			0
@entity133 also has campgrounds , a restaurant , and for a short romantic getaway , the @entity151 offers both daytime and dinner cruises			0
@entity43 this outpost in the @entity24 is home to six fearless residents and the tourists who pass through to see sites like @entity161 's @entity160 , founded by @entity77 himself when he did n't like the town 's restaurants			1
" pardners , you 're lookin ' at the result , " a sign outside the site says , " @entity169 even made sure spirits were included since he could not resist a nip or two occasionally			0
" ( sadly , there 's no dining or nipping at the @entity161 's @entity160 now )			2
it is well worth a visit to the @entity177 , where the wallpaper is composed of paper currency from a variety of countries , sarsaparillas flow freely , and the bar stools are made of horse saddles			0
a post office is also present so intrepid tourists can drop a postcard purchased from the general store into the mail			2
( the general store also stocks some particularly colorful and sparkly cowboy hats			0
) @entity191 like @entity133 , @entity191 was formed by a dam erected along the @entity193			0
today , the site offers intimate coves , hiking trails , fishing , boating and water skiing opportunities			0
those walking around the 17 - mile lake should n't be surprised to see wildlife including javelinas , deer and eagles			1
the site also offers a motel , restaurant and gas station			0
@entity51 and camper hookups are available			0
@entity44 and @entity133 like the @entity211 , @entity44 is a concrete arc designed to conserve water in the desert and provide electricity			2
approximately 300 feet high , the @entity44 contains @entity216 , where tourists can swim , camp , boat , ride personal watercraft and shop at the general store			0
@entity222 visitors who reach the farthest point along the @entity17 loop from the entrance at @entity93 will be rewarded with the sight of @entity222			1
this monument preserves cave dwellings used over 700 years ago by ancient residents in what used to be a bustling community			0
spectacular views of @entity216 are available from the monument			0
@entity222 also has an 18 - minute orientation video in the museum , which can be a welcome retreat if the weather is oppressive			2
special activities including moon hikes , and off - site hikes are scheduled at various times of year , so be sure to check the website in advance of visiting			2
the entire @entity17 takes about six hours to drive through			1
for travelers wanting a shorter journey , it takes approximately 90 minutes to drive the loop from @entity93 to @entity43 and back			1
( the sites are more condensed on this part of the trail and all roads are paved			0
) but whether taking the long or short route , be sure to start off on the trail with a full tank of gas , refilling whenever possible to avoid running empty on the narrow road			0
and keep an eye out for the @entity161 's lost mine -- anyone who finds it would surely prove that the age of expedition and adventure on the @entity17 is far from over .			1

@entity75 's 40 - mile @entity17 captures the flavor of the @entity13
@entity110 , @entity43 offer proof of hardy living past and present
@entity9 and @entity27 lakes provide welcome relief from the dry *climate*
