@entity0 -- @entity0 is a city where history and culture are almost tangible			1
they sprout , grow and bloom in unexpected places , around glittering new skyscrapers , in subway tunnels and in parks			2
and yet , despite their prevalence , history and culture in @entity0 always seem to be teetering on the verge of extinction			1
no doubt , the @entity15 capital has its iconic landmarks that have been around for centuries and will likely endure for centuries to come			0
there is the @entity20 , which is the ancient imperial palace where dozens of @entity15 emperors ruled the country for 500 years			0
there is also the @entity24 , a massive imperial garden built in the 18th century that is on the outskirts of the city			2
and outside of @entity0 , there is , of course , the @entity31			1
tourists flock to these landmarks to get a glimpse of the city 's ancient imperial past			2
yet , the problem for many other places that are emblematic of an old @entity0 is that , in 21st - century @entity15 , they are caught in the middle of a collision between history and modernity			1
in most cases , modernity prevails			0
countless " hutong , " as @entity0 's traditional courtyard housing is called , have been knocked down and replaced by skyscrapers , shopping malls and apartment buildings			1
in @entity58 , a district south of @entity57 once home to @entity54 scholars and opera singers , old hutong were demolished and replaced by renovated hutong that now house stores ranging from @entity61 to @entity62			0
yet , visitors to @entity0 do not have to go too far off the beaten path to find dingy alleyways lined by what remains of the old courtyard homes that exist in clusters , like islands on the verge of being swallowed by the tidal wave of new @entity15			1
further north of @entity58 is a neighborhood called @entity74 that is home to the historic @entity76 and @entity77 , which have helped @entity0 mark the time of day for centuries			1

yet for those that are left standing , there is a charm that endures			0
numerous cafes , boutiques and galleries are hidden along the narrow lanes			0
@entity95 operates a coffee shop called @entity97 in a hutong called @entity99			0
across the street from @entity95 's store is the hutong of a family that has lived there for three generations			0
@entity95 says he knows other families who have lived in the neighborhood for even longer			0
he adds that his neighborhood , and many others around him , are popular spots for travelers looking for a less - commercialized side of the city			0
@entity95 says that the destruction of the old neighborhoods reduces @entity0 into city that is " just like anywhere in the world			1
" about a 10 - minute walk from @entity97 is the @entity121 , which is located in courtyard homes that were once the residences of the postmaster general of the @entity125			0
there are numerous other hutong that have been converted into hotels , offering travelers an authentic alternative to the dozens of international hotels throughout the city			0

the village was started about a decade ago by @entity143 , the now globally famous contemporary and controversial @entity15 artist who was recently arrested , and later released , by the @entity15 government			1
in 2010 , artists and gallery owners in @entity147 received official notices from the local government that their studios were on a demolition list			0
two years later , nothing has happened , and @entity139 is flourishing			1
@entity153 , the village 's annual photo exhibition held every april , now attracts photographers and tourists from around @entity15 and from around the world , while more artists are moving to the area from 798 , another nearby art district , because @entity139 is considered less commercial and more conducive to creative work			1
aside from occasional @entity143 spottings ( the artist still uses his studio in the village ) , other notable artists have studios interspersed between housing units mostly occupied by migrant workers and their families			1
the artists include @entity173 , a @entity15 artist from @entity175 who once played professional soccer and now is known for his installations , performance art and photography both at home and abroad , and @entity181 , an internationally renowned documentary filmmaker			2
while @entity139 is more rugged than the @entity183 , which attracts thousands of tourists annually , it is becoming an increasingly popular destination for travelers seeking a glimpse of @entity15 's burgeoning contemporary art scene			1
it takes around four hours to walk around the dozens of galleries that occupy the grounds			0
some notable places to visit include @entity193 , which houses work from both @entity196 and @entity15 contemporary artists , as well as @entity198 @entity197 , which is housed in a complex designed by @entity143 , and @entity200			2
despite @entity139 's rise , there are still worries that one day that bulldozers might arrive and that it could fall			2
" the people who live and work out in @entity139 and the art community are optimistic about it and want it to be preserved and to be around , " said @entity205 , international program manager for @entity200 , in @entity139			1
" but it is beyond our control			0
" everyday in a park in western @entity0 called @entity214 ( in @entity15 its name is @entity217 ) groups of @entity218 gather who are intimately aware of cultural loss that is beyond their control			1
they are mostly retired and in their 50s and 60s , generations whose coming - of - age experience was during the @entity227 , a traumatic and complicated period in @entity15 history when all things cultural , from art to dance to music to literature , were all but erased from society from the mid- 1960s until the mid- 1970s			1
in @entity235 and in parks across @entity0 these groups gather together to dance the tango , the waltz , the cha cha cha , the foxtrot , mambo and salsa			1
in all corners of the park loud speakers can be found blaring music while couples , groups , individuals simply dance			2
the dancers are perhaps one of @entity0 's most charming , and undiscovered , tourist attractions			2
they are not hard to find , and they are worth watching because they prove that culture in @entity15 's capital is , above all , resilient			2
" before 1980 , no @entity218 knew how to dance , " said a man whose last name is @entity256 ( he declined to provide his first name ) who stood on the sidelines of around a dozen couples dancing under snow - covered trees on a recent morning in @entity214			0
" they come here to dance because it makes them happy			0

@entity0 is a city rich in culture , but its history is *threatened* by modernization
traditional courtyard housing is being demolished , but you can still find it if you look
@entity139 is an urban art village started by artist @entity143
@entity274 can be found in countless parks where locals gather to dance
