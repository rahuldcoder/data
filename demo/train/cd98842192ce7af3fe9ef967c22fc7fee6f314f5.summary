-- @entity1 could probably use another @entity3 boost following tuesday 's news that it lost 25 % of its residents from 2000 to 2010			1
you may remember the catchy @entity8 ad during january 's @entity9			0
to the sounds of a jangly guitar , the rapper drives through the city 's gritty streets , telling the viewer , " this is the @entity1 and this is what we do			1
" the spot ends with " imported from @entity1 , " a message that may have a new meaning , given the latest census numbers			1
according to the @entity23 , @entity1 saw its population drop from 951,270 in 2000 to 713,777 last year -- its lowest since the 1910 census			1
that tells only part of a classic rise and fall of a city that lost residents to the suburbs and the dramatic decline of the auto industry			1
buoyed by industrialization and @entity36 and other entrepreneurs , @entity1 's population skyrocketed at the dawn of the 20th century			1
home to 285,704 people in 1900 , the @entity40 city enjoyed a peak of 1.85 million residents in 1950			0
@entity1 once was the fourth - largest city in the country			1
tuesday 's news was a double blow to @entity40 , which learned in december it was the only state to have a cumulative population loss in the decade			1
the state 's population fell 0.6 % -- from 9.94 million to 9.89 million -- costing the state yet another congressional district			1
at its peak , after the 1960 census , @entity40 had 19 seats in the @entity59 @entity58 , according to the @entity23			2
the state 's @entity61 clout has eroded , one or two seats a decade , since 1980			0
now , it 's down to just 14			0
@entity1 leaders said tuesday the census figures were not accurate			1
" i do n't believe it will stand up " to the city 's planned challenge , said mayor @entity67 , saying the census has a history of undercounting residents in large cities			2
" we are in a fiscal crisis and we have to fight for every dollar , " @entity67 said			0
if another 40,000 residents are verified , @entity1 would meet the 750,000 threshold for ideal federal and state funding , @entity67 said			1
@entity83 president @entity82 told @entity0 affiliate @entity84 the census figure is about 100,000 short			2
" that 's clearly less money from the state and clearly less money from the government if we fall below certain thresholds , " @entity82 said			0
@entity67 told reporters he is committed to help create new jobs and reduce crime			2
@entity40 governor @entity95 said " figures clearly show how crucial it is to reinvent @entity40			0
" " we can not cling to the old ways of doing business , " @entity95 said in a statement tuesday			0
" @entity40 will not succeed if @entity1 and other major cities do n't succeed			1
" losing our best and brightest young adults to other states , or failing to rejuvenate our urban areas , are not acceptable options , " @entity95 continued			0
" fundamental change is needed and we will achieve that by working together with relentless positive action			0
" the state is working to stem the losses			2
the @entity112 , for example , is hoping to tie business development to airports in the region			0
and the news was n't all bad			0
@entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 counties saw population increases			2
the question now is whether @entity1 residents will come out swinging			1
their hockey heroes , the @entity125 , may lead the way			0
playoff tickets go on sale at noon saturday .			0

@entity1 has lowest population since 1910 census count
@entity1 could lose millions in funding
crime , *migration* and decline of auto industry are *factors* in losses
