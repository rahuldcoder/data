-- gov. @entity1 is criticizing the " over-militarization " of the police response to protests that have been spurred by the killing of 18 - year - old @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity1 appeared on most of the political talk shows on sunday , calling the tactics of the @entity11 " aggressive " and expressed relief that the @entity13 is conducting its own investigation into the young man 's death on august 9			1
" there are times when force is necessary , but we really felt that push at that time was a little aggressive , obviously , and those images were not what we were trying to get to , " he said on @entity18 's " @entity17 , " referring to the policing using heavily armored military vehicles			2
" and in those situations where folks are rolling up heavily armored and they 're pointing guns at folks , that 's impossible to have a dialogue , " @entity1 said			1
the governor , however , offered praise for members of the community who have been protesting @entity6 's killing during an encounter with police			1
despite a shooting that left one person wounded and the arrest of seven people after a midnight curfew went into effect saturday night , @entity1 said the curfew was implemented peacefully and mostly without incident			1
" thousands of people spoke last night			0
thousands of people marched and not a single gunshot fired by a member of law enforcement last night , and the members of community ( were ) tremendous helpful last night to get through what could have been a very difficult night , " he said on @entity0 's " @entity51			2
" after days of heavily armed police patrolled the streets of @entity7 with a heavy hand and periodic use of force , @entity1 ordered @entity63 to take over the police response on thursday			1
the head of the @entity63 , capt. @entity66 , is african - american and from the area			0
he took a different approach than police and dramatically softened the aggressive stance			2
critical words about harsh tactics @entity1 is the latest politician to criticize police tactics that created a war zone atmosphere in @entity7 , a town of 22,000 near @entity11			1
@entity8 sen. @entity76 said thursday the situation needs to be " demilitarized , " and on the same day , @entity78 sen. @entity78 of @entity79 , who is considering a presidential run , released an opinion piece on @entity83 's website saying many police departments around the country are too militarized			1
@entity87 rep. @entity86 , who represents @entity7 in @entity88 , said on " @entity51 " sunday that " a militarized police force facing down innocent protesters with sniper rifles and machine guns is totally unacceptable in @entity93			1
" @entity93 rep. @entity94 , @entity95 , also agreed that the reaction of police to protests was imbalanced			0
" it appears that they may have reacted a little quickly on that force continuum when they decided to deal with ... the protesters , " he said on @entity100 ' " @entity99			0
" while @entity105 , a former @entity106 , said the show of force was too excessive while protestors peacefully demonstrated , he said the police have a responsibility to protect personal property			0
" you ca n't let thugs take over the city			0
we saw that the other day			0
the police had to respond , " he said on @entity0 , referring to instances of looting			0
on police militarization in general , @entity105 said the increased militarization of the police started in the 1990s during the height of the war on drugs and continued after the 9/11 attacks and has continued because of mass shootings in schools and public places			0
" it 's absolutely needed , " he said			0
in tense @entity7 , trying to balance security , protesters ' rights the legal process accounts of exactly what happened when officer @entity136 confronted @entity6 on august 9 vary widely			1
police said @entity6 struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon			1
several witnesses said @entity6 raised his hands and was not attacking the officer			1
@entity1 also criticized the @entity142 's release of a convenience store surveillance video that shows a man fitting @entity6 's description allegedly stealing a box of cigars just before @entity6 was killed			1
@entity1 said he was " unaware " the tape was going to be released and " we certainly were not happy			1
" @entity1 said on @entity100 ' " @entity99 " that the tape release is an attempt to " besmirch a victim " and " to tarnish him			1
" " it appeared to , you know , cast aspersions on a young man that was gunned down in the street , " he added on " @entity17			0
" @entity1 also raised doubts about the special prosecutor in charge of the case , @entity164 prosecuting attorney @entity163 , who has been asked by @entity7 community leaders , including rep. @entity86 , to step aside because of what people say is his impartiality toward the police			1
" he 's an experienced prosecutor			2
and this is his opportunity to step up , " @entity1 said on @entity171 , who has been in the position since 1991			2
" it 's important we get this right			0
this is a big matter			0
" @entity179 has defended the police response and slammed @entity1 for sidelining the @entity142 and putting the @entity63 in charge of security , calling the move " shameful , " according to the @entity184			1
offering little confidence to the local investigation , @entity1 said he is pleased that the @entity13 is conducting its own parallel inquiry , noting that the @entity188 is sending 40 investigators			2
" that 's the kind of independent , external , national review and investigation of this that i think will assist everyone in making sure we get to justice , " he said			0
@entity1 's criticism of the @entity142 and shaky confidence of the local prosecutor sunday comes as the @entity13 announced a second , independent autopsy would be conducted on @entity6 's body			1
the healing process as the people of @entity7 seek answers and demand a fair investigation , the factor of race has once again become part of a national discussion that cuts deeply			0
" we all know there 's been a long history of challenges in these areas ( of @entity8 ) , " @entity1 said			1
" and our hope is that , with the help of the people here , that we can be an example of getting justice and getting peace and using that to move forward			0
" but @entity1 admitted that it will be a challenge because of " deep , long - term wounds " that wo n't be easy to heal			2
actor and activist @entity224 discussed a dark history that black @entity93 face			0
" police have been beating the hell out of black people for a very , very , very long time before the advent of the video camera and despite the advent of the video camera there are still a lot of incredible trend of police brutality and killing in the street and justice is never served , " said the " @entity230 " actor and board member of the civil rights organization @entity229			2
on @entity249 's " @entity248 , " rep. @entity244 , @entity245 , who was an instrumental figure in the civil rights movement , called on the police chief and @entity7 's mayor to " literally apologize to the community			2
" @entity253 , professor at @entity254 , said he wants more leadership from president @entity256 , the country 's first black president who was a community organizer in predominately @entity259 - @entity93 neighborhoods of @entity260			0
" this president knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the @entity142 , " he said on @entity100			2
" we need presidential leadership			0
he needs to step up to the plate and be responsible			0
" the @entity269 said the president was briefed on the situation in @entity7 again sunday morning , and he is scheduled to meet with attorney general @entity272 at the @entity269 on monday			0
