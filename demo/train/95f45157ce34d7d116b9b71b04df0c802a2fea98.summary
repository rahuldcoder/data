a small @entity2 town 's discovery that a gunmant killed seven people and injured another thursday night began when a girl managed to flee a residence where she heard gunfire			1
she ran to a neighbor 's house and called police , say investigators in @entity13 , @entity2			1
authorities then found a trail of death that was so staggering , a state trooper lost count at a news conference			1
seven people , all gunshot victims , were found dead in four residences in the small town of 50 people			1
one person managed to survive , and she was found wounded in one of the homes			1
the gunman also was found dead friday morning in a @entity29 pickup after going to another county more than 15 miles away , where he apparently shot himself			1
he was identified friday as @entity33 , 36 , who was believed to be a cousin to four of the seven slain victims , the @entity32 said			1
and , in a twist to their probe , investigators happened upon another body -- that of an elderly woman -- in a fifth home , though she died of natural causes			2
that person was the gunman 's mother , @entity43 , 74			1
she died of metastatic lung cancer , said @entity46 , the coroner for @entity47 , @entity2			1
it was unclear friday whether her death was connected to the case , @entity32 sgt. @entity48 said			2
the gunman 's finding his mother dead could be a motive , " but it would speculation for us to say that is the case , " @entity48 told @entity3			1
" we 're examining of a lot of different avenues now			2
" the gunman " had been ( living ) with her for quite some time , " said @entity47 county sheriff @entity62			2
the shooter did n't leave a note , so investigators are asking family and neighbors about a possible motive , the sheriff said			2
in all , nine of the town 's approximate 50 residents were found dead or killed overnight , nearly decimating the town twice over , according to authorities			1
there were a total of six police scenes : three had two bodies each			2
two had one body each			2
and then there was the site where the suspect apparently committed suicide			1
" everybody is in disbelief now , " @entity48 said			2
they will all just have to take care of each other			0
but it has just shocked this community to its core , and we will just have to work our way through it			0
" among the seven slain gunshot victims were two married couples , who were described as cousins of the gunman , authorities said			0
they were @entity103 , 52 , and wife @entity104 , 47 , and @entity105 , 50 , and wife @entity106 , 48			1
all victims lived within a three - mile radius of each other , authorities said			0
the other three victims were n't identified pending notification of their relatives			0
they were n't from the same family , the sheriff said			0
everyone surely knew each other , the sheriff said			0
" it is a small community out there			1
everybody knows everybody , but as far as what their personal relationship is ... i could n't tell you , " the sheriff said			0
" crime like this in any community is pretty major			0
" investigators spoke to the surviving victim , a woman , but were n't disclosing details , @entity62 said			0
" we obtained part of our information from her , " @entity133 said			0
" as far as i know , she 's expected to be okay			1
" suspect @entity33 , who used a .45 - caliber handgun , had " a minor criminal history " with local authorities , @entity62 added			1
in summarizing the crime , @entity48 momentarily lost track of the death toll at a news conference			0
" there are ... is n't that terrible ? lose count			0
there is actually nine total victims here in this case , " he told reporters			0
the carnage was overwhelming , he added			0
" in our job , we see a lot of bad stuff , and this is bad , " @entity48 said			0
" this is also hard on the police officers who are working out there			0
it 's not natural to see that sort of thing			1
" the juvenile girl whose police call exposed the mass deaths had been in a residence where two bodies were later found , @entity48 said			1
authorities also do n't yet know the relationship between the girl and those two deceased victims , @entity48 said			0
" i do n't have any information that would confirm any of that other than she was at the residence at the time it started , " he said			0
@entity2 gov. @entity176 said the state was ensuring that mental health counselors and crisis intervention services would be provided to students in the area and other residents			1
" this is a horrific tragedy , and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families , " he said			0
the shootings happened in @entity47 , home to about 26,000 people			2
after police found two bodies in the first residence , investigators found five more bodies and an injured person in three other @entity13 homes , according to @entity48			1
the elderly woman who 's believed to have died of natural causes was found in a fifth residence after " investigators were somehow led to that residence after this was all placed in motion , " he said			1
the suspect 's body was found in a vehicle in neighboring @entity207 , @entity48 said			1
@entity13 is about 135 miles ( 217 kilometers ) southwest of @entity208			1
it was n't immediately clear if any of the victims were of school age , but news of the deaths has shaken the community , the superintendent of the area 's schools said friday			2
" there is a lot of speculation right now , and we just do n't have the information			0
the area is within the school district ; these are my families , " said @entity223 , superintendent of the @entity225 @entity224			0
" we run buses out there daily			0
" classes for the district 's 1,000 students are in session friday , in part to give them a sense of normalcy , he said			2
" we do have counselors available , and other offers from other districts to help out			0
as a small town , we all cry together			1
my principals are all assessing the situation now , and we will make a determination on what to do next , " @entity242 said			0
