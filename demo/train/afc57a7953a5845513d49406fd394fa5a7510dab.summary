-- as the @entity3 hockey team imploded , @entity1 exploded			0
protests against @entity7 president @entity6 's administration had turned deadly , and @entity7 athletes at the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity3 , wanted to wear black armbands to commemorate the dead			1
initial reports indicated the @entity14 declined the request			2
later , when a few @entity7 athletes indicated they were leaving @entity10 in solidarity with the protesters , @entity14 spokesman @entity16 told reporters the decision against the armbands had been mutual , and the @entity7 instead opted to observe a moment of silence in the @entity24 : " they were n't forbidden to wear armbands			1
... they discussed what should be done , and they reached the conclusion there were other ways of marking this moment			0
" the muddled situation is par for the course when it comes to politics and the @entity9 , where the positions of the @entity9 committee are often contradictory			1
already in @entity10 , the @entity14 told skiers they could not wear helmet stickers honoring the late @entity42 halfpipe skier @entity43 , and @entity44 could not wear black armbands to memorialize an athlete 's brother who had trained with the team			1
to support such decisions , the @entity14 trots out @entity49 of the @entity50 : " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted			1
" and in 2012 , the @entity14 denied the @entity56 delegation 's request for a moment of silence in the opening ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the massacre in @entity62 , substituting instead a private ceremony -- but it had allowed a tribute in the ceremony to the victims of the @entity68 bombing attacks in 2005			2
and at the last @entity71 in @entity72 , the @entity70 delegation was allowed to wear black armbands in the opening ceremony to honor luger @entity74 , who had died that day in a training run			1
despite the @entity14 's nagging insistence it is apolitical , the @entity9 have been fraught with politics since their inception			1
@entity80 , the only @entity81 ever to head the @entity14 , opposed a @entity81 boycott of the @entity83 in 1936 because " the @entity9 belong to the athletes and not to the politicians			1
" but as the entry to competition is based on national identity , the @entity9 are inherently political			1
the @entity89 magnified their political potential , providing a battlefield for the superpower struggle between communism and democracy to take place over medals , such as the controversial basketball final in @entity62 in 1972 in which the @entity98 were given no less than three chances to make the game - winning basket over the @entity81 , and the " @entity103 " in 1980 when the @entity81 defeated the @entity98 in hockey			2
@entity10 was ripe with politics in the months leading up to the @entity9 , with controversies regarding the environment , corrupt budgets and stray dogs			2
political oppression stood front and center , particularly in the imprisonment of members the women 's punk band @entity115 and the anti-gay legislation that had made @entity3 a dangerous place for many			2
some called for a boycott of these @entity9 , while others agreed that it would be for the athletes to take a stand once there			2
with the @entity7 situation , @entity10 has become even more political , but not for the reasons anticipated			2
while transgender @entity129 activist @entity128 has been detained in @entity130 for her flags and rainbow attire , the athletes have mostly kept quiet			0
early on , pictures of @entity136 's snowboard , adorned with the likeness of @entity115 , gave @entity138 something political to talk about , while ski jumper @entity140 , the first " out " athlete to win a medal in @entity10 , expressed her disapproval of @entity3 's anti-gay laws			0
this past week , snowboarder @entity145 also chimed in , deeming @entity3 a problematic host because it " has people suffer , shuts people up			0
" he speculated that perhaps only @entity149 had the potential for a " perfect " games			0
above all , through the scandals , conflicts and corruption , the @entity14 sees itself as a peacemaker			2
in 1968 , it pressured the @entity159 to take action against sprinters @entity161 and @entity163 after the duo raised black gloved fists during the victory ceremony of the men 's 200 - meter race to protest racial oppression			0
four years later in @entity62 , the @entity14 did not wait for the @entity159 to take action , banning @entity81 sprinters @entity170 and @entity172 for their " disrespectful " behavior on the podium			0
in @entity175 in 2004 , the @entity14 failed to censure world champion @entity177 judoka @entity176 , who carried his country 's flag in the @entity181 and then withdrew from competition after drawing an @entity56 opponent			0
yet it banned @entity184 in its apartheid era and @entity186 when the @entity187 took power , pressured @entity189 to field female athletes and has long recognized teams from @entity192 and @entity193 and @entity195 territories as independent national delegations			0
in @entity10 , @entity14 president @entity197 urged the @entity7 to demonstrate how " sport can build bridges and help to bring people from different backgrounds together in peace			1
" @entity14 member @entity203 , the great pole vaulter who represented both the @entity98 and his native @entity7 in competition , echoed @entity197 's sentiments on @entity208 , urging his compatriots to remember the @entity9 truce and lay down their weapons			1
@entity42 's @entity212 agreed , running the headline , " shadow cast over @entity10 as @entity7 violence shatters @entity9 truce			1
" what is confounding is the impression that until the most recent outbreak of violence in @entity7 , the @entity9 truce was intact in these games			1
the ancient @entity222 invested in the @entity9 as a diplomatic tool , as the spirit of ekecheiria stipulated laying down arms for athletic competition ; they used sport to interrupt the progression of war			0
with the relatively recent creation of the @entity232 , the @entity14 says it wants " to encourage searching for peaceful and diplomatic solutions to the conflicts around the world			0
" black armbands do not seem to fit within the @entity14 's definition of peaceful and diplomatic			1
and perhaps they will become unnecessary if the continuing violence can finally be quelled			0
but that does not mean we are left with sports without politics			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			0

@entity246 : @entity14 mulled letting @entity7 athletes wear black armbands
@entity14 said politics not allowed at @entity9 , but @entity246 says *history* shows otherwise
she says @entity9 inherently political and @entity14 has taken contradictory stands many times
@entity246 : yes , @entity9 truce is central to games , but it does n't mean politics have no place
