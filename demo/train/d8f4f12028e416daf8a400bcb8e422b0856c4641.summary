@entity0 -- on november 2 , 2004 , @entity3 filmmaker @entity2 was bicycling to work in @entity0 when he was shot eight times at close range			0
he died instantly , but in a fit of rage , his assailant , @entity3 - @entity8 @entity7 , also attempted to cut off his head with a machete			0
@entity7 killed @entity2 because of a short film he had recently produced with @entity15 - born @entity3 politician @entity14 that criticized @entity17 's treatment of women			1
the film showed verses of the @entity21 projected onto the bodies of several naked young women			2
it was a film designed to provoke			2
@entity26 subsequently went into a self - imposed exile in the @entity28			1
news : six things to know about the attack now , seven years later , a short , amateurish film entitled " @entity33 , " purportedly created by @entity34 in the @entity28 , portrays the @entity35 as a philandering child molester			1
( " @entity34 " appears to be a pseudonym			0
) @entity38 , a @entity39 pastor based in @entity40 who has a long history of making incendiary statements about @entity17 , is promoting " @entity33			1
" @entity38 also recently called for an " international judge @entity43 " to be held on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 , this past tuesday			0
news about the film has sparked outrage in the @entity17 world			1
mobs have attacked @entity28 embassies and consulates in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
the @entity28 ambassador to @entity53 , @entity56 , and three of his staff members were killed in what appears to have been a well - organized attack on the @entity28 consulate in @entity62 on tuesday			1
the attackers may have used the opportunity presented by the film protests to mount the assault			1
these attacks came after the accidental burning of @entity69 by @entity28 soldiers at @entity71 in @entity72 in february sparked massive protests across the country , resulting in the deaths of at least 30 @entity72 and six @entity28 soldiers , all of whom were shot by men in @entity72 security force uniforms			1
opinion : survivor of 1979 consulate attack -- @entity53 an eerie echo and these are just the latest in a series of violent reactions to the perceived disrespect of the prophet and the quran by @entity91 -- sometimes intentional and sometimes unintentional -- that , in an increasingly globalized world of almost instantaneous communication , has intensified significantly during the past several years			2
and muslim extremists as well as @entity39 fundamentalists in the @entity96 have increasingly intentionally amplified this trend			1
politicians and the media in the @entity17 world have also played an important , though perhaps unintended , role in stirring up violence in the wake of a number of these perceived attacks on @entity17			1
a @entity107 video of " @entity33 " that provoked the @entity53 mob to attack the @entity28 consulate in @entity62 was initially published in july , but it was not until versions of it dubbed in @entity113 appeared online and were broadcast by religious @entity52 news channel @entity114 that protests sprouted in @entity52			1
a may 2005 @entity118 article claiming that @entity28 soldiers at @entity120 had flushed a copy of the @entity21 down the toilet went unnoticed for nearly a week before @entity124 politician @entity123 pointed the article out in a news conference			1
more than a dozen people were subsequently killed during protests in @entity72			2
( @entity118 later retracted the story			0
) similarly , when @entity38 burned a copy of the @entity21 at his church on march 20 , 2011 , two weeks went by without any incident			0
but then president @entity133 of @entity72 made a speech calling for his arrest			0
within 24 hours , protesters stormed the @entity138 compound in @entity139 in northern @entity72 , killing seven foreign employees , and demonstrations across the country killed more than a dozen other people			0
in 2005 , the @entity145 newspaper @entity144 published 12 cartoons of the @entity35 , setting off a wave of protests and attacks over the next several years in which as many as 200 people have been killed			2
in 2008 , for instance , @entity152 claimed responsibility for the bombing of the @entity156 in @entity157 , which killed a half - dozen bystanders , saying the powerful suicide car bomb was in retaliation for the offensive cartoons			0
two years later , @entity162 , one of the cartoonists , barely escaped from a @entity15 man linked to @entity165 , @entity152 's @entity15 affiliate , who broke into the cartoonist 's home in @entity145 with a knife and ax			2
but the violence sparked by the @entity144 cartoons , one of which depicted the @entity35 with a turban - wrapped bomb on his head , began a full four months after the images were published by the newspaper and were the result of a carefully orchestrated campaign by two @entity145 @entity17 clerics who toured the @entity182 , presenting a dossier about the cartoons to important religious and political figures			1
opinion : @entity53 killings show @entity28 at risk in @entity190 world included in the dossier were cartoons that had never appeared in the @entity144 newspaper , showing offensive images of the @entity35			2
as a result , entering the @entity196 - @entity144 newspaper in @entity197 today is akin to visiting a prison , with a heavily barred set of metal gates securing entrance to the building			0
and just as author @entity204 remains under threat decades after the 1989 fatwa against him for his novel " @entity210 , " so too the threat against @entity209 - @entity144 is likely to endure for many years			0
on wednesday , @entity133 released a public statement strongly condemning the recent " criminal act			0
" this was not a reference to the assault on the @entity28 consulate in @entity53 a day earlier that resulted in the four deaths there but to the release of " @entity33 , " the video that denigrates the @entity35			2
news : unanswered questions after the attack @entity133 did express his condolences about the deaths at the @entity53 consulate when he spoke privately to president @entity226			0
however , his public statement will surely draw attention to an issue that is likely to cause additional violent protests in @entity72 , which @entity232 forces are steeling themselves for			0
with allies like these , who needs enemies ?			0

@entity238 : violence against @entity28 over film is part of a pattern of incidents
he says @entity39 and @entity17 extremists have incited deadly protests for years
@entity249 : in several cases , the words of political *leaders* have helped spark violence
