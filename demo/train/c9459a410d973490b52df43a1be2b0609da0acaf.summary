-- @entity1 clearly has a great deal going on			1
between being dad to six children , a @entity5 © , an activist and a perfume pitchman , he still manages to squeeze in some time acting			2
the movie star recently sat down with " @entity10 's " @entity9 to talk about his latest project , the mob film " @entity13 , " and that nagging question of when he plans to marry partner @entity15			1
@entity9 : @entity1 , we 've got a mob movie and i believe the first one we 've seen that has political campaign speeches throughout it			1
@entity1 : i like to mix it up			1
@entity9 : was this -- for you -- as much about making a mob movie as it was about sending a political message ? @entity1 : this is a good friend of mine , the writer and director , @entity29 , he 's from @entity32 , and his view of @entity34 was very interesting to me			1
his feeling in some way oppressed and that we get caught up in trying to sell the idea that the image is more important than the actual substance			2
this is what he was trying to tell with this story			0
he finds this book about a crime syndicate , and he makes these comparisons to -- not politics , per se , or not just politics , but ... the financial crisis itself , and it was a good subject matter			0
@entity9 : i know , and timely ! the idea of the mob dealing with corporate concerns or falling off a fiscal cliff			2
how timely is that coming off this political season ? @entity1 : absolutely ! and how much are we really dealing with -- the issue 's always at the image of the issue , and oftentimes , a scapegoat is found , but it 's not really solved			1
this is what our film is about			2
it 's about get the games going again , get the perception that the machine 's running again so everyone can feel confident , have market confidence and get on with the game			0
@entity9 : i want to ask you specifically ... about an issue that 's been at the forefront for you and @entity15 , and that is the issue of marriage equality			1
that is something that you guys have obviously done a phenomenal job moving forward and getting the message out about what should be done			0
you 've talked about perception versus what happens in reality sometimes			0
when and why did that become so important to you guys ? @entity1 : it 's one of our last big issues of equality			1
what makes this nation great is our freedoms and the idea of equality , the true idea of equality -- and in that definition , there 's a certain faction of our society that is not being included			0
and that time ... it 's time ! yeah , it 's time			0
@entity9 : you guys have once famously said you would hold off on getting married until everybody could get married			2
and i know now you 're engaged			0
you said you 're doing it for the kids , which obviously everybody 's excited about			0
@entity1 : and ourselves , but they prompted it			1
@entity9 : are they pressuring you at all to set a date ? are they getting on you about this ? @entity1 : no , not necessarily			1
@entity9 : do you think it 's something you 'll make public ? because obviously there 's a huge interest , demand , people want to feel like they 're a part when you guys actually get married			2
@entity1 : we do n't know			1
we have n't gotten that far yet			0
@entity9 : you can not turn on the tv without seeing the @entity129 ad			1
obviously , @entity1 , you know that got such a huge reaction			1
did you get a kick out of the reaction ? @entity1 : i say fair play ! @entity9 : absolutely			1
i say they got their money 's worth			0
i mean , the number of times it got played from people talking about it			0
@entity1 : you know , i 'm not a part of that side of the marketing , but fair play ! @entity9 : last thing : i want to flash back			1
we 're going to have a little fun			0
i just want you to take a quick look at this guy here			0
( @entity1 watched clip of himself from " @entity158			1
" ) @entity1 : was that ? really ? i do n't even recognize that guy ! was this -- what year ? @entity9 : you had just gotten out to @entity163 maybe six months prior			2
what advice would this guy in the chair across from me give that guy there ? @entity1 : i think that guy did all right			2
i think he figured it out quite fine			0
i do n't think i need to tell him much .			0

@entity1 plays a mob *enforcer* in his new film , " @entity13 "
he said their children are not prompting him and @entity15 to get married
he has a sense of humor about the ribbing surrounding his @entity129 ad
