-- for the first time in a few years , talk about airline bankruptcies has ramped up once again , with concerns expressed this week about a certain carrier based in @entity5			1
whether the reports about @entity7 are true or not does n't really matter -- it 's enough to make people anxious			1
i 've received a fair bit of e-mail this last week asking what happens if bankruptcy becomes a reality			2
in short , there 's nothing to worry about with an airline like @entity19 , but i thought it would be a good idea to devote this week 's column to the issue since it 's at the top of mind for many travelers			1
will @entity19 go bankrupt ? i 'm certainly not qualified to answer that question			1
only the airline itself knows its plans , but the balance sheet certainly does n't point to bankruptcy being necessary in the short to medium term			1
yes , @entity19 has been losing money recently while others have profited , but at the end of june , it had more than $ 5 billion in the bank and it has been able to arrange financing since then			1
that does n't sound like a company that would be filing for bankruptcy protection , which should be a last resort			2
even if it does for some strategic reason , flights would n't be affected			0
still , it 's worth talking about what to do when an airline goes bankrupt , because airlines around the world shut down every year			2
it 's always good to know what you can do			0
always pay with a credit card when you buy a ticket , you might be paying for something ( a flight , presumably ) that you wo n't use for another year			0
that 's a long time for an airline to hold on to your money , and that 's why you should pay with a credit card			2
if you buy a ticket with a credit card , then you wo n't be on the hook if your airline goes under			2
in fact , when airlines start to find themselves in financial trouble , credit card processors hold back a larger and larger percentage of the money until the flight occurs			0
that way , if the airline does n't perform , the credit card company still has your money and can give it right back to you			2
periodically check in on your airline it sounds silly when you 're talking about an airline like @entity19 , because you would know instantly if it filed for bankruptcy protection			1
but what if you bought a ticket on @entity88 - based @entity87 ? would you even know that it shut down in march of this year ? probably not			0
so if you do find yourself booked on an airline that might not be very well known here in the @entity19 , it ca n't hurt to check in every so often to make sure it 's still flying			1
most airlines with websites are very good at letting you know when they go out of business			0
even better , you can set up an alert via @entity100 that will send you a note anytime an airline 's name pops up in the news			1
this is hardly necessary for the better - known airlines around the world , of course , but it 's a good idea for smaller airlines that you want to keep an eye on			0
have a backup plan if you 're worried about an airline going out of business for one reason or another , have a mental backup plan waiting in case you need to spring into action			2
find out what other airlines fly where you need to go , and be ready to try to pounce if something happens			0
if you 're prepared , you 'll be able to get that last seat on your alternate before someone else who was unprepared even knows what 's happening			0
but you 'll still have to pay for it			0
do n't expect help from other airlines there used to be a rule in the @entity19 that other airlines had to honor tickets on failed airlines for a nominal fee			1
that does n't exist anymore , so do n't go looking for charity from other airlines if yours goes under			0
elsewhere in the world , there can be varying levels of assistance , but it 's best to just assume that you 'll get none			0
at best , you 'll be lucky to find an airline that will take you on standby , but that 's not necessarily helpful for people with set plans			0
ultimately , the best advice is to just be alert			1
if your airline stops flying , act quickly to find the best alternate options , and you 'll still get where you need to go			0
but if you 're worried about a big airline failing here in the @entity19 , i would n't get too worked up about it			1
the chances of that are incredibly slim , even if bankruptcy is involved .			1

travelers worry as bankruptcy fears swirl around @entity7
@entity166 : chances of a big airline failing in the @entity19 are incredibly slim
ultimately , the best advice is to just be alert , he says
