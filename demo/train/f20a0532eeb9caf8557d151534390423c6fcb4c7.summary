a new year and a prime time to make resolutions -- a word that stems from the @entity6 word resolutio , which roughly translates to " intense self - flagellation followed by structured reflection on the things you hate about yourself			1
" allow us to aid you in this endeavor			0
now that you 've finally finished reading dozens of surprisingly obnoxious top 10 lists , we 're going to start the year off with a review of seven equally obnoxious netiquette faux pas to avoid in ' 11			1
think of it as a quick precis of all the dumb moves we tried to shake out of you in 2010 ( research , after all , shows that refreshing your memory at spaced - out intervals is key to remembering stuff long - term )			1
no reverse - order countdown , though			1
after all , this is n't a moment of @entity29 - fueled chanting in @entity30			1
say it with me , now			0
in 2011 , i will not ... 1			0
... send an unspeakably rude e-mail to one of my employees or co-workers			0
" ? ! " alone does not an e-mail make			0
forgetting your " pleases " and " thank yous " ? just as bad			0
carpal tunnel syndrome be damned , make this the year you actually tap out respectful missives to those in your midst			2
... chase a messy breakup with sad - clown @entity48 statuses and hours of sob - wracked ex stalking			1
quit squeezing lemon juice on your wounds			0
apps like @entity55 and the @entity56 ( which , yes , we inspired by sighing loudly and whining , " why ca n't someone make my loser exes disappear ? " ) make moving on ... well , not as easy as it was in pre-digital times , but fairly comparable			2
... waste everyone 's time with inane tweets			2
yes , @entity66 can be a repository for banal thoughts and stomach - churning overshares			1
it can also be a useful tool for sharing links , connecting with online and real - life friends , and adding to the general conversation			1
( hey , do n't laugh -- remember how the @entity76 deemed this all archive - worthy ? five hundred years from now , they 'll be like , " @entity80 , those 2010 - era plebeians were really into laser cats			1
" ) aim to give each tweet a bit of value : a tip , a crowdsource attempt , even a little zing to get your followers to : )			0
... keep my wedding photo as my @entity48 profile pic for five months or more			1
that 's really great that you got married			2
however , my congratulatory spirit wore out approximately 4.5 months ago			0
time to go back to being a person with a personality instead of just a bride , mmkay ? 5			0
... leave offensive , sexist , childish or straight - up stupid comments			2
actual responses and commentary are the lovely nerve network of @entity106			0
as for the trash : yeah , instead of bothering with the noncontribution , we suggest you check out the billions of other things you could be browsing on the www this very minute			0
or drunk - e - mail			2
or drunk - update - le - facebook - status			1
it 's 2011 , folks -- of course the coders who hand you such digital @entity123 guns have figured out how to add safety latches			2
apps like @entity126 and the social media sobriety test mitigate the damage			0
if only you 'd done some sober installing before your big @entity133 open bar , the decade might 've begun on a much less sloppy , indelicate foot			0
... peck away at my smartphone during dinner			0
or brunch , or really any moment involving real - life interaction -- because it 's incredibly impolite and likely detrimental to your ability to enjoy a tender interaction or a crisp walk through the park			1
look , if there 's one addiction worth breaking this year , it 's your clinically significant dependence on regular @entity149 checks			1
because let 's face it , the whiskey binges and late - night @entity151 you swore off on 1/1/11 are n't going anywhere .			1

do n't chase a messy breakup with sad - clown @entity48 status updates
@entity66 can be a useful tool as well as a repository for banal thoughts
if there 's one habit worth breaking this year , it 's your smartphone addiction
