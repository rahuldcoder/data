after months of questions and pressure from whistle - blowers , academic reform groups , the public and members of @entity7 , the @entity0 has decided to reopen its investigation into @entity9 over its so - called paper class scandal			1
@entity9 has been under scrutiny since 2011 , when it was revealed that it had hundreds of classes in the @entity13 that required no attendance and just a single paper			1
the issue received national attention after @entity19 highlighted literacy problems at @entity9			1
in one @entity19 report , whistle - blower @entity21 said the so - called " paper classes " were well known by the athletic support staff as easy classes for athletes who needed to stay eligible , and that the papers were often plagiarized			1
@entity21 's job was to help athletes who were n't quite ready academically for the work required at @entity9 at @entity9 , one of the country 's top public universities			1
she said she learned about the fake classes through her work			0
even though many athletes were enrolled in those paper classes , the @entity0 had previously decided the scandal was not an athletic one , and did not sanction the university			1
that left a lot of unanswered questions and prompted rep. @entity45 , @entity46 , to write a letter to @entity0 president @entity48 demanding answers			2
@entity21 said she was not interviewed by the @entity0 during its first investigation			2
on monday , she said the @entity0 had lost credibility by not investigating the issue			1
now , she said , the @entity0 should n't focus on punishment : " instead , they should focus on how to use the @entity9 example to reform the entire system			1
" several athletes have also said publicly that they were forced to major in @entity58 by athletic staff			1
for years , and after several internal investigations , @entity9 said a single professor , @entity61 , knew about the fake classes			2
until now , the @entity0 stood behind the university on that claim			2
then , earlier this year , after a flurry of national reporting , @entity9 commissioned yet another investigation , this time by former homeland security secretary @entity68			2
@entity68 has received 1.5 million e-mails and documents , interviewed more than 30 employees , and acquired athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s in his investigation			0
while he is not giving updates , he did tell the @entity9 board at a meeting recently that his team has gotten " extremely valuable " information from people who have reached out to help the investigation			0
among those cooperating , he said , is @entity61			0
@entity61 was indicted on a fraud charge in december , but @entity84 district attorney @entity83 said recently that he is considering dropping the charge because @entity61 has been so cooperative			0
" even though it 's a noncriminal investigation , that is more important than this , " @entity83 said , referring to @entity68 's review			0
" the money is paid back already , " @entity83 said			0
" this was more of an academic scandal than any kind of criminal issue			0
... in the criminal probe what we 're left with is one low - level nonviolent felony for a person never in trouble before in his life			0
" @entity9 said it directed @entity68 to share what he finds with the @entity0 , and both @entity9 and the @entity0 said that it was the cooperation from " additional people " that prompted the @entity0 investigation to be re-opened			1
@entity45 ' office has received a response from the @entity0			0
a spokesman for his office said it is still going through the response .			0

@entity9 is accused of putting athletes in easy @entity58 classes
the classes required no attendance , had one paper *assigned*
@entity0 originally did not classify the issue as an athletic one
