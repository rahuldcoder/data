-- the last time most @entity1 focused on pillaged antiquities from @entity3 was likely after the release of the @entity6 film " @entity7 : @entity8 , " which featured the heroine 's adventures through the country 's famous archaeological wonder , @entity13			1
now , real " tomb raiding " is making the news as the @entity3 government seeks to recover antiquities allegedly plundered from the kingdom 's ancient sites during its civil war , ethnic cleansing and foreign occupation			1
at @entity3 's request , the @entity23 recently filed suit in @entity26 against @entity27 's in @entity1 , demanding that the auction house forfeit a sandstone warrior that was " illicitly removed , " according to the complaint , from a remote jungle temple			1
but according to a recent @entity33 story , @entity3 has now set its sights on another @entity36 institution : the @entity37 of art. it has specifically targeted the highlight of its @entity41 collection : two kneeling figures that archaeologists declare are companions to the contested @entity27 's piece			1
if these stones could speak , what a story they would tell			0
carved in the 10th century by some of the most skilled artisans known to history , they originally adorned the sanctuary of @entity55 , at the temple complex of @entity57			0
experts believe that with other characters , they formed a three dimensional tableau from the @entity62 epic the @entity63 for a millennium			0
they say that came to an end when paramilitary groups trafficked them , sculpture by sculpture , overseas			0
what a strange twist of fate : having traveled halfway around the world , quite possibly through the illicit and licit markets , the three disputed objects are now just miles apart in @entity1			0
@entity78 's forceful request for their return has alarmed the less scrupulous in the art world , and with good reason : they have a lot to lose if the art is repatriated			1
@entity23 and @entity87 galleries , auction houses and museums are allegedly full of @entity3 plunder			1
many of these artifacts were allegedely stolen during the country 's long conflict , making them " blood antiquities , " little different than " blood diamonds " from @entity97 and other war - torn @entity99 states			2
the years before , during , and after the @entity101 decimated the @entity3 population and led to the looting of most of the nation 's archaeological sites			1
yet sadly , now that @entity3 is at peace and in a position to recover its rightful property , some collectors are portraying themselves as the victims			2
in the wake of the @entity27 's case , one @entity41 specialist lamented the " crisis " now facing collectors			1
she warned that such legal actions " threaten the very future of collecting and collecting museums " and the " next generation of collectors , donors and patrons			0
" such histrionics aside , it will always be difficult and expensive for countries such as @entity3 to recover their pillaged heritage through the courts , even when in the right			2
especially when its acquisition may have been made possible by tragedies such as the holocaust , @entity3 's killing fields or even the more recent looting of the @entity136 during the @entity138 war , the real issue is why any collector or museum would want to possess stolen art ? thankfully , individuals and institutions who would argue to keep looted art are a minority and do as much disservice to their fellows as they do to victims of the illicit art trade			1
indeed , many have voluntarily repatriated antiquities to @entity3 , once learning they were wartime plunder			2
the @entity37 is no exception , having itself returned a valuable piece to the country in 1997 at its own initiative			0
there is much common ground between archaeologists , collectors and curators , as all share a love of the past , if not an outright obsession with it			0
archaeologists recognize that there will always be , and should be , a legal market for antiquities , just as most collectors and curators agree that the looting of archaeological sites and trafficking of antiquities must be stopped			0
indeed , if there is to be any real progress , both sides of the issue will likley have to make concessions			2
but as campaigns like @entity3 's demonstrate , the art world must reconsider what is ethically acceptable			1
and today , the sale , purchase and exhibition of " blood antiquities " is not only deplorable , it may actually be criminal			0
( the sale , possession , and transport of stolen property is illegal under the @entity192			0
) @entity27 's and the @entity37 have a choice : they can treat @entity3 's requests as obstacles , or recognize them as the opportunities they are to right past wrongs and set the moral standard for the entire field			1
for @entity3 's sake , as well as their own -- and for all of humanity that finds these treasures important -- let us hope that they choose wisely			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 and @entity210 .			0

**writers** : @entity37 and @entity27 's have ancient figures thought to have been looted in @entity3
@entity23 authorities have attempted to seize @entity27 's figures ; now @entity3 seeking those at @entity37
@entity209 , @entity217 say some in art world act the victim because @entity3 wants its art back
**writers** : why would anyone want stolen art ? both sides must make reasonable concessions
