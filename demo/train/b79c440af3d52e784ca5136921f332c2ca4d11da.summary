-- @entity2 horse - racing authorities handed the trainer of @entity4 hopeful i 'll have another a 45 - day suspension thursday stemming from a 2010 race with another horse , but cleared him of giving that horse an energy - boosting cocktail			1
the suspension wo n't take effect until at least july 1 , meaning trainer @entity13 will be able to participate in the june 9 @entity15 -- when @entity16 and @entity18 winner i 'll have another is carrying high hopes for the sport 's first @entity4 since 1978			1
and the @entity23 's decision explicitly cleared @entity13 of " milkshaking " the throughbred @entity24 during a race at southern @entity2 's @entity27 track in september 2010			1
the board did find @entity13 , as @entity30 's trainer , was responsible for high total carbon dioxide levels found in its blood -- a sign a horse might have been given a " milkshake " of baking soda , electrolytes and sugar believed to help it combat fatigue			1
it fined him $ 15,000 , and said another 135 days of suspension could be applied if @entity13 is found to have violated other rules in any jurisdiction			0
but a state hearing officer found no sign of any " intentional acts " on the part of the trainer or any sign that betting on the race had been skewed toward @entity53 , which finished well out of the money in eighth place			0
@entity13 can challenge the finding in court , but his brother , @entity58 , said no decision has been made on how to proceed			0
" we 're just ecstatic that the judge ruled we did n't do anything to make the @entity65 ( total carbon dioxide ) level go up , " @entity58 told @entity0			2
but he said there was " absolutely " no doubt his brother would be able to take part in the @entity15 , in @entity70			2
" we 're very happy that the press release is very clear that @entity13 never milkshaked the horse , and there was no suspicious betting pattern , " he added			0
@entity75 , a spokesman for the @entity76 , said that agency would review @entity2 's decision			2
but since the suspension wo n't take effect until july , " it should have no bearing on the june 9 @entity15 , " he said			1
the 2010 allegation is n't the first scrape @entity13 has had with @entity2 regulators			2
in 2007 , he was fined $ 3,000 after another horse showed high carbon dioxide levels			1
and in 2010 , the @entity88 suspended him for 15 days when another horse showed high blood co2 levels ; @entity2 's racing board issued him a matching suspension			1
but there have been no allegations that @entity13 had given a milkshake to i 'll have another			0
and his brother told @entity0 earlier this week that " we 've never milkshaked a horse			0
" " we would n't know how to do it , " @entity102 " @entity100 said			0
" it 's never been done by us or anybody in the barn			0

new : @entity2 action wo n't *affect* *upcoming* @entity15 , @entity70 official says
@entity13 trained @entity16 and @entity18 winner i 'll have another
@entity2 's state racing board suspended him for 45 days effective july 1 at earliest
@entity13 was cleared of " milkshaking " but hit for high carbon dioxide levels in his horse 's blood
