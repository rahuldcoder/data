@entity0 , @entity1 -- at a prize ceremony honoring peace , @entity3 says violence and injustice sent him rushing toward the stage			1
in a matter of seconds , the 21 - year - old @entity11 student 's face was seen around the world last week as he stood in front of @entity16 at the @entity18 ceremony in @entity0 , @entity1			1
" please @entity16 , @entity11 , " he repeated as he unfurled a @entity11 flag on the stage at @entity0 's @entity20 , where the 17 - year - old laureate was about to become the youngest person ever to receive the prestigious award			1
@entity0 police have come under fire over the incident , with critics asking how someone who was n't on the ceremony 's guest list managed to slip through security checkpoints and make it to the front of the room , standing just steps away from @entity16 and other dignitaries before security hauled him out of the auditorium			1
speaking to @entity2 at an @entity0 detention center on sunday , @entity3 said he knows it was a drastic move			2
but he felt like he had no choice and wanted only a few seconds to speak about @entity11 's problems on a global stage			2
" my motivation was to show solidarity with all the things that have happened in my country , ultimately , well , the 43 missing students , who are suspected to be dead and burned , that was my main motivation , " he said			1
" i am tired of so many injustices that we have lived in @entity11 , for decades			2
" the students ' case has sparked national outrage in @entity11 and drawn global attention to the country 's continued struggles to deal with police corruption and drug - related violence			1
authorities have said the students from a rural teachers college were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor , then delivered to the drug gang to be executed			0
@entity11 's attorney general says the students ' remains were burned at a landfill , placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river			2

@entity3 said he was seeking asylum in @entity1 , but authorities there have informed him that he 'll be sent back to @entity11 on monday , @entity76 and his attorney said			2
before learning that he was getting kicked out of @entity1 , he told @entity2 he was scared to return to his home country			0
" i do not want to be one more student who disappears and who later turns up dead and the government later says that it was organized crime , " he said			0
@entity3 told @entity2 he went through a security checkpoint with invited guests at last week 's ceremony , but no one asked him for identification or stopped him as he approached the stage			1

@entity0 police said @entity3 had been fined 15,000 kroner ( $ 2,040 ) for nuisance and for entering the @entity20 illegally			1
even critics who question the appropriateness of disrupting the @entity102 ceremony would have done the same thing , he said , " if they had a little bit of empathy toward what all the families of so many people who have been killed and disappeared in @entity11 have felt , this desperation and this impotence to not have a way to express themselves and demand justice			0
" @entity2 's @entity110 reported from @entity0			0
