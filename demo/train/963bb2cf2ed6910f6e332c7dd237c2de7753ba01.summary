@entity0 -- it might remind you of the new smash - hit @entity5 movie " @entity7 " , in which the villains steal a device with top secret information on the identities of @entity14 agents			1
but in this case , sensitive data was left on a subway train			1
law enforcement and congressional sources tell @entity1 a contractor working for the @entity21 accidentally left a pouch containing two computer backup tapes on a train in @entity0 's @entity26 subway system			1
the tapes contained very sensitive @entity21 personnel and investigative information , and if accessed could be highly damaging , according to sources			1
the contractor was transporting the pouch from @entity21 headquarters in @entity0 to a now - closed data facility in @entity34			1
the sources say the contractor got off a @entity26 train , and later realized the pouch had been left behind			1
the @entity21 and the @entity26 police were contacted , and an aggressive search took place			1
according to one source , the tapes have not been recovered			2
the incident occurred nearly five years ago , in february 2008			2
it is now the subject of an investigation by the @entity48 's @entity47 , according to a congressional source			0
that office would not comment on why the investigation is taking place now , or on any other aspect of the investigation			0
@entity53 , a former @entity54 counterespionage agent , said , " some of the information could cause lives to be at risk , if someone wanted to get at the families of a high - level government worker or someone they perceived as being someone who could work against , say , a terrorist cell			2
" @entity53 is the agent who took down @entity64 , an @entity54 official who spied for the @entity65 and @entity66 in the 1980s and 1990s			0
the @entity21 says no lives were put at risk , and no fraud was committed as a result of the loss			2
but why would the agency put sensitive information on a removable set of tapes ? " part of the reason , i think ... is that in 2008 when this occurred , some of the information might have been on removable discs because that 's how they transported information , " @entity53 told @entity1			1
" we 've leapt forward in technology since then			0
" the @entity21 issued a statement acknowledging the loss of information			1
" these back - up tapes were not marked or identified in any way and were protected by multiple layers of security. , " it said			0
" they could not be accessed without the proper equipment , applications and encoding			0
" there is conflicting information on whether the tapes were encrypted			2
@entity53 , a partner at the security firm @entity99 , says even if they were , " this is 2008 encryption			2
and years later , our abilities to break encryption , our algorithms to do that , are much , much better			0
if those tapes were found , i 'm sure they could be cracked in moments			0
" a @entity21 official did not provide the name of the individual who left the tapes on the train , or the name of the contracting firm			1
the official would not comment on whether the individual was disciplined , and said he is not sure if the agency still does business with the firm			0
@entity53 has his own questions about the incident			0
" why did a contractor have it ? " he asks			0
" why was n't it chained to his wrist with a handcuff in a case that he would , the second he stood up , think ' i need to grab it ' ? " asked those questions by @entity1 , a @entity21 official did not answer directly , but instead referred to part of the agency 's statement saying , " subsequent to this incident the @entity21 instituted protocols to prevent this from happening again			1
" @entity1 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
