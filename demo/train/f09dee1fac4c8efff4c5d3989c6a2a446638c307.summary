-- the public has been shaking its collective head since rumors of a @entity7 - @entity6 collaboration began circulating on the @entity8 last week			1
once the artists ' respective remixes , " @entity13 " and " @entity14 , " featuring each other , hit the web on monday , that head - shaking turned into full - blown opposition			1
some have questioned why @entity7 would musically reunite with her ex and whether their working together was a straight career move or a byproduct of her feelings for @entity6			1
but based on the way the " @entity27 " singer markets herself , industry experts agree , her decision to collaborate with @entity6 is actually quite characteristic			1
" so much of ( @entity7 's ) music is about being in control of herself , " said @entity29 , the managing editor of @entity30			0
" some of her fans have been really surprised by ( her working with @entity6 again ) , but a lot of her other fans are so used to her making these big , bold statements			1
" @entity7 has been in the game for a long time , @entity29 said , and she wants people to know that she makes her own decisions			0
" this is her way of saying , ' i 've made peace with my past			0
' " since he pleaded guilty in june 2009 to assaulting his then - girlfriend on the eve of the @entity48 , @entity6 's career has flourished -- as has @entity7 's			1
country singer @entity49 and @entity51 's dr. @entity50 are among those weighing in on @entity6 's successes in addition to his troubles , including outbursts on @entity57 and a reported tantrum after an appearance on @entity61 's " @entity60 " last year			1
a firestorm erupted when many women tweeted after this year 's @entity64 that they would let @entity6 beat them			1
but while the response to the pair 's partnership has been overwhelmingly negative , their remixes have actually been well - received , said @entity50 , @entity69 's senior editor for music			1
" say what you will about them ... but when they 're on a track together , it sort of lights up and ignites , " @entity50 said			0
referencing @entity7 's " s&m , " which shocked listeners with talk of chains and whips , he said that " these two are all about pushing buttons			0
" what is boils down to , @entity50 added , is whether people have the ability to separate the artists ' personal lives from their music			2
it 's unclear what effect their collaborations will have on their careers			0
but the critics seem to be out in full force			0
a recent @entity98 story titled " @entity7 and @entity6 deserve each other " states , " apparently , @entity7 wants to show her independence and @entity6 wants to show that he can beat a woman and still get her to be friends			1
" and @entity106 , who hosts @entity108 's @entity107 , said that all tracks featuring @entity6 have been pulled from the radio show after numerous parents complained			2
the backlash could n't have come as a surprise to the two artists			2
music producer @entity115 , who wrote " @entity13 " with @entity7 , told @entity30 it was actually her idea to feature @entity6 on the song 's remix			1
" when she raised the question to me , i know she 's not crazy , " he said			0
" so my thought was , ' you 've been thinking about this ; you 've already thought it out , so evidently you know what reaction you gon na get			0
' " despite the fact that @entity7 typically embraces her sexuality in her music , " @entity14 " ( which features the lyrics , " so let 's go tonight and do whatever it takes to make it right " ) and " @entity13 's " explicit nature are a bit jarring , given the pair 's history , said @entity129 , @entity130 's editorial director			1
even so , @entity129 said , he ca n't see @entity7 's career being hurt by the collaboration			0
" if @entity6 can rebound from ( the assault ) ... please do n't tell me that @entity7 ca n't rebound from what some are perceiving as a lapse in judgment , " he added			2
in the end , fans reserve the right to support the artists or not , but onlookers have to remember , this is still a real and tumultuous situation			2
" people have the tendency to forget that maybe this is n't some kind of contrived career move or a staged opportunity for @entity157 , " @entity129 said			0
" this media - saturated world is trying to make sense of a very , very human decision			2
" i would like to think she 's thought through the consequences , but i do n't think she 's making this decision with an eye toward her career , " @entity129 added			0
" she 's probably just thinking with her heart			0

the artists ' remixes , " @entity13 " and " @entity14 , " hit the web on monday
response to partnership has been negative , but remixes are doing well
@entity6 pleaded guilty in june 2009 to assaulting his then - girlfriend
