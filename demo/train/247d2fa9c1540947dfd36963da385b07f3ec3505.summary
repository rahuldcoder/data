" today " show host @entity30 asked her on wednesday if she planned to follow guidelines and finish that quarantine on november 10			2
" i do n't plan on sticking to the guidelines , " she said			1
" i remain appalled by these home quarantine policies that have been forced upon me			2
" that could set up a confrontation with @entity12 officials			2
photos : ebola patients in the @entity39 a fight ahead ? @entity12 officials are " exploring all of our options " to protect residents ' health , gov. @entity45 said wednesday after news of @entity15 resisting a home quarantine			1
he did not name the nurse			0
in a written statement , the governor said she " has been unwilling to follow the protocols set forth by the @entity12 @entity52 and the @entity52 for medical workers who have been in contact with @entity7 patients			1
" the statement did n't say which protocols she was resisting but added that @entity45 is seeking legal authority to enforce a quarantine			2
@entity2 's attempts to contact @entity45 's office were n't immediately successful			0
@entity45 has said the state would work with @entity15 on a plan to isolate her for the 21 - day period			1
one of @entity15 's lawyers , @entity65 , told @entity30 that officials had until thursday to adjust their approach , and if they tried to physically apprehend @entity15 after she once she stops obeying the quarantine , her legal team would take the matter to court			1
on tuesday , the state 's health commissioner -- without naming @entity15 -- warned that the state would force the quarantine if she did n't isolate herself willingly			1
" if an individual who came in direct contact with @entity7 patients has returned to @entity12 and is not willing to avoid public contact and stay in their home voluntarily during the period they are at some risk , we will take additional measures and pursue appropriate authority to ensure they make no public contact , " @entity12 @entity76 commissioner @entity75 told reporters tuesday			1
" i want to be sure everyone understands what quarantine means in this case , " @entity75 said			0
" stating it plainly , what we are asking for is that individuals who had direct contact with @entity7 patients stay in their home and avoid public contact until the 21 days for potential incubation has passed			1
" on @entity2 , @entity15 attorney @entity101 said he thinks the next step is up to @entity12			1
" we had been attempting to work with them to try to find some kind of compromise here , but that has not been possible , " he said			0
" and i saw from their news conference last night that they intend to try to seek an order			0
we have received no paper , so at this point she is not under any restriction other than her own voluntary staying in the house today			0
" @entity101 said that knowing for certain what could happen legally is unclear because " we 're treading in areas " in which " there 's not a whole lot of case law			0
" however , he said , " society has a right to protect itself from legitimate issues of public health , but it ca n't do it based on what the ( @entity39 ) @entity127 calls fear			2
" the lawyer referred to the opinion of dr. @entity132 who also discussed the @entity15 case on @entity2 on wednesday , weighing in as an independent medical expert			2
he specializes in infectious disease and is a member of the @entity39 government 's @entity137			0

he said he worried that some had " forgotten " established science about the virus			0
lawyer : nurse will follow @entity52 guidelines @entity65 told the @entity150 newspaper that @entity15 would contest any court order			1
but she will abide by guidelines from the @entity52 that say she should subject herself to monitoring , such as daily reporting of measured temperatures			0
" the conditions that the state of @entity12 is now requiring @entity15 to comply with are unconstitutional and illegal and there is no justification for the state of @entity12 to infringe on her liberty , " @entity65 told the @entity14			1
@entity15 told " today " that she 's in good health and is not having symptoms			1
a person must be symptomatic to be contagious if they have @entity7			1
the nurse said that she thinks it would be " reasonable , " in circumstances like hers , to self - monitor for symptoms but not be quarantined			0
those are the steps that the organization , @entity173 , recommends			0
she spent time recently in @entity175 treating @entity7 patients with the group			1

@entity5 officials additionally said that screeners determined that she had a fever at the airport			0
but @entity15 , speaking to @entity2 over the weekend from her quarantine tent at a @entity5 hospital , said she never had a fever			1

dispute about quarantine policies @entity5 gov. @entity197 said the state agreed to let her go to @entity12 after confirming she " was no longer symptomatic , " but is unapologetic about @entity5 's quarantine policy			1
@entity15 told " today " that she witnessed " complete disorganization " at the airport in @entity201 and that @entity179 and @entity5 's policies are " not scientifically " or " constitutionally just			2
" the policies , she believes , will be a " big deterrent " to health care workers from going to @entity8 to treat patients because they wo n't want to be quarantined when they return if , like her , they are asymptomatic			1
" it 's already difficult for people to take time out of their lives to go and respond , " she said , though she plans on definitely going back because it feels like a " privilege to help			0
