-- governor of @entity2 ? who 'd want that job ? it 's a state where politics have long been considered a bloodsport , where corrupt politicians are as common as slices of pizza , where fights can quickly get personal , and where the top politician lives a life constantly on the edge			1
it 's a state whose politics have been awash in scandals for decades , particularly within its towns and communities			1
in the past 20 years , the state 's biggest cultural exports have been a show about organized crime and " @entity24 " -- a show , as most @entity2 residents will be quick to tell you starred mostly @entity27			1
but , in spite of this , @entity28 take great pride in their state and have taken great pride in their governor			2
before taking the state 's highest office , @entity35 toppled corrupt @entity2 mayors like they were dominoes , sending them to jail one after another			1
it was one of the most impressive demonstrations of good government in the state 's history			2
@entity47 : is @entity35 presidential ? as governor , he was lauded for his leadership and his outspokenness , and he was criticized by some in his own party for his praise of president @entity55 after @entity56			1
but what never wavered was @entity35 's commitment to taking on the big issues			1
so for many @entity61 , it 's disappointing to see @entity35 now focused on answering for the actions of staff			1
what they did was wrong , but if you stop and look more closely , those attacking him most harshly clearly have their own agendas			0
she 'd love to make @entity35 's downfall her legacy			1
prior to this current drama , @entity71 is best known for being a victim of the @entity77 scam , and then for drawing on a pension system to supplement her legislative salary			0
she and @entity35 have been battling for years , and she 's seeing an opportunity for payback			1
meanwhile , @entity72 assemblyman @entity82 , another @entity35 foe , is dying for a better position in leadership , even though he 's deputy speaker , a powerful chairman and the new head of an investigative committee			1
he 's certainly got an eye on the front office himself			2
and congressman @entity91 ? he 's only spent decades trying to run for statewide office			2
he 'd love to take down @entity35 and ignore the fact that tourism ads are regular practice in @entity2 or any other state with an abundant coastline			1
the congressman certainly never complained about tourism ads during the 25 years he 's represented a district that benefited from those very tourist dollars			2
ad firm head : we were asked about using @entity35 in ad campaign it 's not just @entity2 democrats who are playing politics with the outspoken governor and possible candidate for president in 2016			1
democrats on the national level are sending fundraising letters and raising money on the backs of the popular governor			0
they 'll do whatever it takes to clear the field for @entity121			0
but the most disappointing attacks are coming from the right wing of the @entity124			0
after two crushing presidential elections and a paralyzed @entity128 , our party is badly in need of leadership			0
with a strong , outspoken candidate , @entity124 could be right back on top			0
demonstrated leadership is what will be needed in the big domestic fights that are right over the horizon , as well as those brewing overseas			0
just do n't let the candidate be from @entity2			1
they say that if everyone hates you , you must be doing something right			0
can @entity35 change the subject ? last week @entity35 held an exhausting two - hour press conference to answer questions about @entity146			1
it could not have been easy to distance himself from his two - time campaign manager -- the man who would have run @entity35 's presidential campaign should he choose to run			1
try to remember the last time you saw a politician separate himself from someone that powerful in the organization			0
i 'm hard pressed to find one			0
this week in his speech , @entity35 again addressed the issue			1
but what he did next took great leadership			0
he proposed longer school days			0
he proposed changes to the state tax code			0
he took on the pension system			0
@entity35 still is n't afraid to do big things			1
the guy is gearing up for the next big fight			0
the long shadow of politics , both @entity173 and @entity124 will keep hovering -- as will the national media -- waiting for his next move , eyeing his fundraising trips , watching for early signs of 2016 interest			2
none of which is going to deter the governor from doing what is necessary			0
there 's something to be said for a politician who makes tough decisions			2
what also should be said is , governor , thanks for taking the job			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2
