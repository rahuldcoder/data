-- early this year , @entity1 made news by announcing he is gay			2
on saturday , he made history as the first openly gay player to be drafted by a @entity6 team			1
seconds later , he made waves kissing his boyfriend in celebration as cameras looked on			0
now , @entity1 has one goal in mind -- to make the @entity15 ' roster			1
" i 'm determined to be great , " he told reporters tuesday in @entity15			0
" so i 'm going to train hard and try to make the team			1
" as a selection in the seventh and last round in the @entity6 draft , @entity1 playing for the @entity15 or any other @entity6 team this upcoming season is hardly a lock			1
and with standouts like @entity25 and @entity26 , the fact that @entity15 boasts one of the league 's best defensive lines -- the place where @entity1 starred at the @entity32 -- makes his task even harder			1
that challenge is n't lost on @entity1 , who some experts thought might not fit in the @entity6 not because of his sexual orientation but because they characterized him as a " tweener " -- too small to play on the defensive line , too slow to be a linebacker			1
still , he sees the chance to learn from his @entity15 coaches and teammates things that can help improve his game			0
and he seemed careful tuesday not to get too far ahead of himself , expressing thanks for being given " the opportunity to play " but professing no certainty that he will be on the sidelines come opening day			0
" i still ( do n't ) really feel like i 'm part of the @entity6 right now , " @entity1 said of the whirlwind of the past three days			2
" i 'm blessed , really			0
" @entity51 congratulates @entity1 the company around him during his first media availability tuesday showed that he 's not the only prospective football player living a dream			1
other late - round selections for the @entity15 joined him in fielding questions			0
and each had their own one - of - a - kind stories -- like @entity60 , who lost his grandmother and great - grandmother on the same day a few years after his mother died , or @entity64 's having worked at @entity15 ' @entity65 to pay for college			0
yet the fact that @entity1 was the only player at the podium a few minutes later speaks to the fact that he was extraordinary , even among @entity6 draftees			2
not every would - be pro wins @entity72 's @entity71 , gets a phone call from president @entity51 after getting drafted , or ranks second in jersey sales among rookies , after all			0
@entity1 has recently tasted the flip side of stardom as well -- as a number of people , among them current and former @entity6 players , took to @entity82 to rip @entity72 for airing footage of him kissing his boyfriend , @entity84 , right after he got the call from the @entity15			1
reactions heat up after @entity1 kisses boyfriend on tv @entity1 noted that he 'd never experienced all this attention as an openly gay player at @entity32 because , while he confided his sexuality to coaches and teammates before the 2013 season , he did n't announce anything publicly until february			1
now that he 's out , he said any jabs about his sexuality would fuel him on the gridiron			0
" thank @entity98 for you guys , " @entity1 said , referring to the media , " because it 's just going to make me even a better player than i am now			1
" @entity104 , the @entity15 chief operating officer , said the organization discussed the ramifications of picking a man who could become the @entity6 's first openly gay player			1
" if you 're going to take a leadership position by drafting @entity1 , then i think you have to expect both the good and the bad , " @entity104 said of the public reaction			2
" we 're prepared for it , and i think we 'll shine through it			0
" @entity15 general manager @entity115 acknowledged @entity1 's selection is historic , comparing it to @entity118 's becoming the league 's first black player , in 1946			1
moments later , though , head coach @entity121 stressed that the team did what it did based on what @entity1 could do for the @entity15 on the field			2
" @entity1 's value as a football player was off the charts , " @entity121 said			2
" so we drafted @entity1 as a football player			0
and he has an opportunity now to compete to try to make our football team			0
" opinion : just a kiss , and more than a kiss			0

@entity1 is the first openly gay player to be picked by , and *possibly* play for , an @entity6 team
he says he 's *focused* on football , will train hard to " try to make the team "
all the media hype over his sexuality will " make me *...* a better player , " @entity1 says
@entity15 *coo* : team took the lead , is ready for ramifications of drafting @entity1
