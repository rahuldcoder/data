it was the opportunity of a lifetime for a young @entity4 boy -- a scholarship to study medicine in @entity7			1
but his journey did n't go quite as expected			1
@entity10 could n't get a direct flight to @entity7 so he boarded a plane in @entity4 to @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15			1
there , he bought a ticket to his final destination in @entity7 -- a @entity20 country on the @entity22 coast bordering @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity15			1
but when he got off the plane , he was not in @entity7 -- he was in the city of @entity27 , @entity15 -- almost 3,000 kilometers away from where he needed to go			1
@entity10 spent a week in @entity15 , supported by strangers as he had no money			1
the airline that sold him the original ticket eventually helped him out with a new flight to @entity7 's @entity34 , near the capital @entity36			1
you 'd think with all the technology at our disposal , destination mix - ups like what @entity10 experienced would be a rarity			2
in june of 2014 , a couple boarded a plane to the southern @entity22 island of @entity48 , instead of their desired destination -- the ancient city of @entity52 , @entity53			2
@entity55 dentist @entity54 thought he 'd bought tickets from @entity58 's @entity57 to @entity52 , @entity53 , for himself and his partner via a @entity61 booking agent , but only realized he was actually headed to @entity48 in the @entity22 once on board , reported @entity63			1
the destination country and flight duration had n't been listed on his e-tickets , which instead displayed only the city name			2
" it 's just so sad , " @entity54 told @entity63			2
" a trip we had been really looking forward to was ruined and ... @entity61 wo n't do the decent thing			2
" @entity54 claimed the airline refused to reimburse his first - class tickets and did n't reroute the travelers to @entity52 from @entity48			2
he ended up suing @entity61 for the cost of the trip , including planned tours in @entity53 that he and his partner did n't get to take , but the case was reportedly dismissed			1
remarkably , the same mix - up happened earlier that same month			2
@entity80 from @entity81 , @entity82 , had also booked a @entity61 flight to @entity52 , @entity53 , but found herself on a flight bound for @entity48 in the @entity22			2
she 'd planned the trip after being diagnosed with cancer			0
when notified of the mistake , the @entity61 crew moved @entity89 to first class and sent her back to @entity57 when the flight made a scheduled stop in @entity93 , reported the @entity94			0
" i genuinely do n't blame anyone , " she told the @entity94			0
" the person on the other end of the phone probably just misheard me			0
i honestly did n't notice the spelling difference			0
" in may 2013 , @entity100 and her husband , @entity101 , boarded a @entity103 flight in @entity104 , intending to travel to @entity105 , @entity106 , in western @entity107 , but ended up in @entity108 , @entity109			1
the mix - up was due to the similar sounding destinations and airport codes			0
the couple did n't realize the error until they were already on their connecting flight from @entity117			0
" when the flight attendant said we were heading to @entity108 , we believed that this was how you pronounced ' @entity105 ' with a @entity123 accent , " @entity100 told the @entity118			0
in december 2013 , 85 - year - old @entity124 ended up in @entity125 , @entity126 , after she 'd booked a @entity128 flight to @entity129 , @entity130			1
it was the second time such a mix - up had happened to her -- two years ago , the airline flew @entity124 to @entity135 , @entity130 , instead of @entity136 , @entity137			0
according to @entity137 's @entity138 , @entity124 had requested wheelchair assistance , which meant airline staff were responsible for assisting her from gate to gate			0
" i can see it happening once , but twice to the same person , it 's kind of like lightning striking twice in the same place , " her son @entity145 told @entity138			0
last june , a @entity151 plane that took off from @entity152 landed at the wrong airport			1
instead of arriving in @entity155 near @entity156 , the aircraft landed 140 kilometers away in @entity157			0
the airline flew the misdirected passengers to their original destination via another flight , reported local news outlet @entity163			1
in january earlier that year , another @entity128 plane landed at a small airport in @entity166 , @entity167 , approximately seven miles from where it was meant to land at @entity169			0
due to the difference in airport runway lengths -- @entity166 airport 's runway is 3,738 feet compared with @entity169 's 7,140 feet -- pilots were forced to brake hard when the plane touched down			0
no one was hurt and the airline refunded all tickets and provided future travel credit for passengers			1
