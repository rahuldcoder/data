-- self - discipline and a bit of synchronicity have turned into best - selling success for author @entity5			1
the former high school teacher describes writing fiction as taking the chaos that 's happening inside him and turning it into something orderly on the page			2
it 's working : he has turned out four best - selling books , including one , " the @entity16 , " that was made into an @entity18 - winning movie			1
now @entity5 is continuing to ride his hot streak with a new novel , " the @entity21 of @entity22 , " out this month			1
in " the @entity21 of @entity22 , " @entity5 's narrator also turns to writing to make sense of his life			1
dementia takes over in the final days of @entity29 's mother 's life , and she starts calling her son @entity30			1
he finds a " @entity33 " form letter signed by actor @entity32 , and thinking there must be some connection , @entity29 starts writing awkward , intimate letters to the actor			1
" dear mr. @entity32 , " each chapter of the novel begins			1
from there , @entity29 confesses his grief over his mother 's death , his insecurities about life on his own and growing doubts over his catholic faith			1
@entity5 's quirky supporting cast includes a heavy - drinking , self - defrocked priest , a redheaded grief counselor with serious boyfriend problems , a foul - mouthed movie theater usher mourning the loss of his cat and the shy woman @entity29 has a crush on , who he dubs the " @entity59			1
" this group of misfits comes together as friends , strengthening their offbeat bond on a whimsical road trip to @entity65			0
@entity5 recently talked to @entity0 about his new book and his burgeoning success			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
fast facts age : 40 hometown : he 's originally from @entity73 , grew up in @entity74 , @entity75 , and now lives in central @entity76			2
other titles : " @entity78 " and young adult novels , " @entity80 , " " @entity81 " and " @entity82 , @entity83 " fun facts : @entity5 got the nickname " q " from his players when he coached girls ' soccer and it stuck with him			1
for fans of : " @entity91 , " " @entity92 , " " @entity93 " five questions for @entity5 @entity0 : what was the spark behind your new novel ? quick : i had thought up the title , " the @entity21 of @entity22 , " several years ago			1
i had no idea what it meant or what the book would be about but i thought , " someday i 'm going to write a book with that title			2
" then several years ago ... i remember coming home and my wife said , " somebody famous wrote you today , " and thinking " wow , " then opening the letter and realizing it was a " @entity33 " form letter			2
i thought about the power of celebrity and the fact there are people who probably believe they 're receiving a letter that @entity32 personally signed himself			1
then , in the wake of all the promotion i did for " @entity16 , " i found myself in this position where i had dreamed about being ... and then suddenly i 'm in a hotel room sitting on a couch with @entity125 doing interviews or i 'm standing backstage at the @entity128 show , chatting with @entity129			0
while it was wonderful and i 'm very grateful for those experiences , there are times when the former kid from a blue - collar neighborhood with a working - class background kept saying , " how did you get here ? " to be honest with you , that kept me up at night			2
so when i started to write " the @entity21 of @entity22 , " i wanted to approach some of life 's bigger questions , but i wanted to do it in a way that would take me back to a time when i could look at things a little more simply			1
@entity0 : your characters deal with mental health issues , you 've also battled depression yourself			0
is writing a way for you to deal with that ? quick : when i wrote " @entity16 , " i thought i was writing a book about the @entity156 and male bonding , but when the book came out , it was surprising to me that the mental health community embraced it			1
the mental health conversation is very important to me			0
i have friends that struggle with various mental illnesses			0
i 've struggled with depression and anxiety			0
i 'm very interested in how we deal with that			0
the problem with the stigma around mental health is really about the stories that we tell ourselves as a society			0
what is normal ? that 's just a story that we tell ourselves			1
@entity0 : @entity178 is a concept that comes up in your new novel			0
have you noticed examples of it in your own life ? quick : i 'm not an expert , but i 'm fascinated by the concept			0
writing " the @entity21 of @entity22 , " synchronicity just abounded			1
in little things , such as in the novel , the characters go on a road trip and i just arbitrarily picked the car that they rented would be a @entity195			0
after i finished writing the novel , my wife suggested we take the same road trip to do research and add details			0
so we rented a car and at the rental place i said , " give me an economy car , i do n't care which model , any one will do			0
" about five minutes later they come back and say " mr. @entity5 , here 's your @entity195			1
" my wife and i just looked at each other and started laughing			0
@entity0 : after the success of " @entity16 , " you have multiple movie adaptations of your books in the works			2
how are they going ? quick : all of my books have been optioned by major studios in @entity220 i feel wildly blessed			2
that was the plan all along , but there have definitely been head - scratching moments where i think , how did this happen ? the important thing for me is to take those questions and make more art , let it fuel the writing of my future novels			2
i always say the writing will save you			0
@entity0 : have you heard from @entity32 about your new book ? quick : we sent him a copy and i know that it was received			1
i 'm assuming if he had any problems with it , we would have heard back			0
there are some rumors in terms of the movie that i ca n't talk about yet			0
i have n't been in direct contact with @entity32 , but our people in @entity246 have			2
@entity0 : what 's next ? quick : i 'm actually working on the final edit of " @entity250 , " which comes out in 2015			2
@entity251 bought the movie rights last fall			0
@entity253 , who has written the screenplay for " the @entity21 of @entity22 , " is also working on adapting this			1
i love @entity253 's stuff			0
and i 've started working on my next novel , which , if everything goes according to schedule , will come out in 2016 .			0
