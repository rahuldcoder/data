@entity0 , @entity1 -- for more than three months , @entity3 has wondered how the man who police say was driving drunk and involved in a crash last year that killed her daughter could be pardoned for a previous felony drunken driving offense			1
former @entity1 gov. @entity9 has said he did n't know that retired @entity11 investigator @entity10 had been arrested for a dui months after the state 's parole board recommended that @entity9 grant him a full pardon			1
( police have determined that while @entity10 was driving under the influence , he was not at fault for the accident ) but e-mails recently obtained by @entity2 show that @entity9 's office was aware of @entity10 's october dui arrest months before @entity9 pardoned him along with more than 200 other convicted felons during his last days in office in january			1
" they knew it , and they did n't stop it , " said @entity3 , referring to the pardon			2
" why did n't they do something ? " @entity3 spoke to @entity2 , overcome with emotion after reading the e-mails obtained through a public records request from @entity1 's @entity34			1
the e-mails show that @entity36 , the governor 's chief counsel , and secretary of state @entity39 were told about the october car crash that killed @entity3 's 18 - year - old daughter , @entity42 , just days after it happened			1
read the e-mails ( @entity45 ) @entity46 and @entity39 were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented @entity10 not to issue the pardon , according to the e-mails			1
it is not known whether anyone communicated this information to @entity9			0
his spokeswoman would not comment on the e-mails , citing an ongoing case on executive pardon power that is before the state @entity58			2
@entity9 granted @entity10 a full pardon in january for a felony drunken driving offense in march 2009			1
it was @entity10 's third drunken driving arrest in a little more than year			1
the full pardon gave @entity10 back the rights that were taken away as a felon , such as voting , but his two other @entity12 convictions remain on his record , according to the state attorney 's office in @entity71			1
@entity10 was still going through a court - mandated drug rehab program when he applied for a pardon last summer			1
on september 30 , the @entity75 sent its review of @entity10 's application to @entity9 , recommending a full pardon in a 3 - 2 vote			1
a week later , on october 7 , @entity10 was driving under the influence again , according to the @entity81			1
@entity42 attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside @entity83 when @entity10 's truck slammed into the side of her car			1
@entity42 was killed , and her older sister suffered serious injuries			2
@entity10 was jailed for violating his probation from his previous @entity12 cases			1
when he received the pardon in january , the convicted @entity12 felon still sat in an @entity94 , @entity1 , jail cell , awaiting formal charges for his fourth drunken driving arrest			1
a police investigation found that @entity10 was under the influence of alcohol while driving but has determined that he was not at fault for the accident , according to the @entity81			2
@entity10 has not been charged , and his case is expected to go before a grand jury , according to the state attorney 's office			1
if he is charged and convicted for the @entity12 offense , he will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence because it will be treated as his third @entity12 offense , instead of his fourth			1
however , he could go back to being a felon , and losing the rights restored to him under the pardon , with a third conviction			2
neither @entity10 nor his lawyers have returned calls from @entity2 seeking comment			2
@entity10 's case offers a close look into the pardon process and the friendships and ties that often intersect with the political world			1
high - profile friends of the former federal investigator 's , including lawyers and former @entity127 attorneys , wrote letters to @entity9 touting what they called @entity10 's genuine lifestyle change			2
the letters detail what friends described as @entity10 's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a " freakish house fire " and his subsequent divorce , according to pardon and parole documents obtained by @entity2			1
" @entity10 has led a tragic life			2
a life that has now been turned around by a grace that is bigger than him , " wrote retired @entity127 attorney @entity142			0
" he can now be a positive factor in many lives			0
" another former federal prosecutor , @entity147 , who is married to the sister of @entity142 's wife , also tried to help @entity10 get his pardon			2
" @entity10 is a friend			2
he was a very good agent and worked a lot of drug cases and money laundering cases for me , " @entity147 told @entity2			0
" he was an outstanding officer			0
i knew him as a friend			2
" @entity147 , an attorney in the firm that has represented @entity10 in his @entity12 cases , said he called @entity39 , his old law school friend , to help with the pardon , even though the secretary of state 's office has no official authority to issue pardons			1
after the october crash that killed @entity42 , @entity147 reached out to @entity39 in an october 11 e-mail , asking him to back off on the pardon			1
" you asked me if he was straight and i gave you my word yes			0
for this i give you my sincere apology			0
i had no idea he had messed up			0
hold up on helping him			0
all of us are in shock			0
sorry , " @entity147 wrote			0
he signed the letter , " your friend bob			0
" @entity39 forwarded this e-mail to @entity9 's chief counsel , @entity36			0
her e-mail reply : " ok will do			0
" it 's not known whether @entity46 spoke to @entity9 about this before he issued @entity10 's pardon			2
she did not return calls seeking comment			0
a spokeswoman for @entity39 said he never discussed the matter directly with @entity9			0
@entity46 no longer works in the governor 's office and is currently employed by the @entity1 law firm @entity188 , the same firm that employs the former governor			1
@entity147 said the october e-mail was the last communication he had about @entity10 's pardon			1
" i told @entity39 that i wanted him to pull back that pardon			0
it must not have gotten to the governor if he got pardoned , " he said			0
@entity9 has repeatedly said that as a @entity196 , he believes in forgiveness and second chances			0
wearing a pendant with her daughter 's image emblazoned on it , @entity3 said she sees the whole affair as the good ol ' boy network at its worst			0
" all i think about is my child every day , but i do know that certain people had to know , and they did n't do anything , " she said with tears in her eyes			0
" @entity9 had to have known			0
it 's their job to tell him , so he had to have known , " she said			0
" how do you do that ? " watch @entity214 360 ° weeknights 10pm et. for the latest from ac360 ° click here .			0
