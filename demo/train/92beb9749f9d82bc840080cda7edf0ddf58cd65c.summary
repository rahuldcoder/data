-- @entity1 has taken another hit from @entity3 in @entity4 , thanks to an appeals court in @entity7			1
the court ruled on tuesday morning that the @entity9 7.7 indeed infringes upon @entity3 's design patent for the @entity11 , and banned it from sale across the @entity14			1
the @entity15 , however , managed to make its way through the cracks , with the court allowing it to be sold in @entity7			0
the @entity19 had already been banned from sale in @entity7 thanks to a decision from a lower court in late 2011			2
at that time , the court treated @entity7 as a separate entity from @entity1 in @entity25 ; the latter was able to continue selling the tablet throughout the rest of @entity4			0

according to a statement released by the court , the @entity19 infringes upon @entity3 's registered @entity39 for the @entity11			1

the appeals court also upheld a previous ruling that the @entity15 â € ” the larger of @entity1 's two tablets â € ” had indeed been sufficiently changed from the original @entity44 design , therefore differentiating it enough from the @entity11			1
