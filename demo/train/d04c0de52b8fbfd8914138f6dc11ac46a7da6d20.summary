-- over the past decade , an increasing percentage of @entity2 lost health insurance coverage because they could n't afford it			1
as a family physician , i have seen the devastating effects of losing health insurance			0
without it , patients die unnecessarily			2
since passage of the @entity12 , it is heartwarming to see patients gain insurance , get healthier and catch up on health care services they were unable to obtain before			1
but it is heartbreaking to see the herculean efforts to eliminate subsidies that made it possible for these working @entity2 to finally afford health insurance			1
recently , there have been two opposing court of appeals rulings on a crucial aspect of the @entity12			2
the first , if it eventually prevails , would not allow about 4.5 million people who gained subsidized insurance in the federal exchanges to get financial assistance			2
thankfully , a different court of appeals found just the opposite			0
faq : what the @entity12 court decisions mean for you there will be no shortage of court challenges trying to chip away at the @entity12 , but gutting the @entity12 would just strip patients of their means to obtain cancer treatment and other life - saving health care			1
two years ago , i diagnosed a 52 - year - old uninsured man with @entity47 colon cancer , which took his life			0
months earlier , he had noticed blood in his stool and had been scheduled for a colonoscopy			0
without health insurance to pay for this costly test , he postponed it while waiting for financial assistance to help him buy health insurance coverage			0
it is likely that a health insurance subsidy would have saved his life			0
appeals courts differ on @entity12 ; @entity62 case likely another patient , diagnosed with @entity70 breast cancer on a routine mammogram , said to me : " @entity72 , i do n't care whether i have to eat beans and rice every day for the rest of my life , i am saving every cent to hold onto my health insurance because it will save my life ! " she is now cancer - free and living a full and meaningful life			1
when @entity81 expanded health insurance coverage through policies similar to @entity12 , the state death rate fell by nearly 3 % in the four years after the law went into effect			2
the decline was steepest in counties with the highest proportions of poor and previously uninsured people			0
study : @entity12 gave 10 million @entity2 health insurance in other states with populations similar to @entity81 , the death rate was largely unchanged			1
for every 830 people who gained health insurance in @entity81 , one life was saved			0
nationally , this 3 % decline in mortality among adults under age 65 translates to about 17,000 fewer people dying each year			0
health insurance matters for health and well - being			0
@entity2 with health insurance are far more likely to receive primary and preventive care as well as timely and appropriate care for chronic conditions			1
without health insurance , @entity2 have significantly more unmet health care needs and higher rates of delayed care			2
when faced with illness , the uninsured are forced to make an impossible choice : incur unaffordable health care costs or gamble on their health , forgoing needed care			0
the @entity12 enables millions of uninsured @entity2 to gain coverage and finally shed the fears of what might happen to themselves and their families if faced with this impossible choice			1
watchdog : fake applicants got @entity12 subsidies let 's keep moving forward with covering the uninsured in this country , there 's no time to waste			1
the millions of dollars being spent in courts across the country to challenge the @entity12 and to eliminate insurance subsidies for working @entity2 might be better spent to create subsidies ensuring access to health insurance coverage that saves lives			1
i have been involved in efforts as a physician - scientist working to discover new cures for the @entity2 epidemic of " uninsurance " and finding new treatments for our nation 's " inequitable access to care " disease			1
recently , i heard several top scientists debating whether we should keep asking the question : " does health insurance matter ? " consider the following two questions			0
are you willing to drop your health insurance policy immediately and go without health insurance indefinitely ? are you willing to enroll in a study where you are randomized to receive health insurance or go without health insurance for a long period ? if your answer to either or both of these questions is " no , " then we should stop asking whether insurance matters and move forward toward insuring every @entity2			2
there 's no time to waste in court battles			1
and , the @entity2 health care system has plenty more problems in need of immediate and urgent attention , including the primary care workforce shortage , the unsustainable costs of care and the disparities in health care access			2
let 's get people insured .			0

before @entity12 , @entity175 saw people lose insurance and suffer
today , she sees patients gain insurance , get healthier , and get care they could n't afford before
she *laments* " herculean efforts " to end subsidies for working @entity2 to finally get insured
@entity175 says court battles are a waste of time : @entity2 are dying unnecessarily
