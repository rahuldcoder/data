-- judges on the paradise @entity3 island of @entity4 sentencing @entity6 grandmother @entity5 to death on january 22 held that she had " tarnished the image of @entity4 as a holiday destination			1
" no one expected a death sentence because the prosecutor , recognizing the sympathetic circumstances of the case , had only asked for a 15 - year prison sentence			1
@entity5 heard the gasps in the courtroom when the sentence was handed down but did n't realize what had happened because her interpreter only translated part of what was said			1
he filled in the gaps with " blah blah blah " as he had done at all of her hearings over the past few months			2

in the middle of the night , as tourists sleep or party , @entity5 will be dressed in white and taken to a remote beach on an island where she will be tied to a pole placed in the sand			1
the firing squad of around 10 police from the elite paramilitary mobile brigade will have spent the days ahead of the execution practising using human - shaped targets			2
@entity5 will be hooded and a reflective marker will be placed over her chest to enable the shooters to see their target			1
the firing squad will take aim then shoot her through the heart from a meter away			2
death by firing squad is not fast or painless			2
a priest , @entity59 , who witnessed the executions of two @entity61 convicted of trafficking heroin in 2008 , said they moaned and gurgled for up to 10 minutes after being shot			0
he sang " @entity66 " to try to comfort them as they died			0
i traveled to @entity3 a few years ago -- like many other tourists , i had long dreamed of seeing wild orangutans in the jungle near @entity71			0
i had no idea that three people were executed by firing squad in that jungle in 2004			0
one was @entity75 , an @entity76 man shot in august			0
@entity77 has expressed concern that his trial may not have upheld international standards for fairness			0
due to a lack of legal representation or access to interpretation services before the trial , he was unable to prepare an adequate defense			0
@entity75 's lawyer raised concerns that the evidence against him ( 12 kilograms of heroin that he was convicted of trafficking ) had not been presented in court			1
like @entity5 , @entity75 was interrogated by the police without a lawyer or an interpreter			1
his lawyers were only informed of his execution after he had already been shot in the jungle and he never got the chance to say goodbye to his family			0
that october , a @entity107 man and woman were executed			0
both came from a poor neighborhood of @entity111			0
the executions of these impoverished people have tarnished my memories of that holiday forever -- i will never think of the jungle without remembering that shots rang out there and people moaned in pain as they died			0
an independent expert on the drugs trade concluded that @entity5 's mental health problems would have made her an " attractive target " for the " threats , manipulation and coercion " of those who forced her into carrying the package by threatening her children			1
surely the judges in @entity5 's case must know that sentencing people to die by tying them to poles and killing them slowly in jungles or on @entity4 's white sand beaches does more to damage the reputation of @entity4 as a holiday destination than the actions of a terrified , vulnerable grandmother trying to protect her children			1
read more : @entity3 sentences @entity6 woman to death for drug smuggling it has to be hoped that this point will be considered			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			2

@entity5 was sentenced to death in @entity4 for smuggling *cocaine*
the prosecutor had only asked for a 15 - year prison term , so the sentence was *unexpected*
@entity5 would have been an " attractive target " for " threats , " @entity149 writes
the @entity162 lawyer argues the case will tarnish @entity4 's reputation more than the @entity166 's actions
