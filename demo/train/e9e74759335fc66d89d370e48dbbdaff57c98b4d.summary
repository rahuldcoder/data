the man who stars as the rev. @entity1 in " @entity2 " seems as divinely appointed to the role as the leader he portrays was to the civil rights movement			1
@entity7 said it was seven years ago when he read the script for the film about the marches in the @entity13 city and the fight to pass the @entity15			2
he so felt @entity16 telling him the role of @entity1 was meant for him that he wrote the date down to remember it			1
but it was a long road for the @entity21 actor who was faced with everything from being little known beyond small parts in films like " @entity25 " to those connected to the film having a different vision for who should star			1
yet @entity7 never lost faith			2
he told @entity3 that he took the challenge of playing one of history 's giants very seriously			2
" doubt ... never really beset me , " he said			2
" what did hit me were moments of feeling the weight ... and the responsibility to get it right			2
" how do you pronounce ' @entity7 ' ? @entity41 offers a singalong guide the film focuses on three months in @entity2 , @entity13 , in 1965 when nonviolent protesters held civil rights marches including " @entity46 , " when law enforcement clashed with demonstrators using billy clubs and tear gas on @entity2 's @entity51			2
some lost their lives in the midst of the tension over the protests and @entity7 said that in studying @entity1 he learned a great deal about how conflicted the leader felt during that time			2
" the thing that really struck me was the weight and the guilt he felt about the people who were killed , " the actor said			1
@entity64 has called " @entity2 " " the film of the year " and noted that " this solid , expertly managed drama , with its stark images of good men standing up to entrenched government evil , has earned critical hosannahs and could be the breakout favorite among year - end contenders for the @entity72			0
" @entity7 's performance has been hailed for embracing both @entity1 the legend and the man			1
" @entity7 is superb in the central role of @entity1 , capturing his famous cadences without ever descending into mimicry , " @entity77 wriote for the @entity78			1
" this is a life - sized portrait of a larger - than - life figure , and never more so than in the scenes between @entity1 and his wife @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , their marriage strained not only by the ever - present threat of violence but also by his own serial infidelities , which the movie handles with tact but does not shy away from			0
" the star is not the only one who sees a greater hand in the project			1
@entity99 served as one of the producers on the film and has a small role			1
she told @entity104 she believes it 's not accidental that the film , which will open nationwide on january 9 , is being released at a time when the nation is once again focused on race in the wake of the controversial deaths of black men in @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115			0
" divine timing is what it is , " said @entity99 , who also co-starred with @entity7 in " @entity116 " and has become his mentor			1
@entity72 buzz is ever present for the movie in every category from best picture to best director for @entity125 , who could become the first @entity128 - @entity127 woman nominated in the category			0
in addition to @entity99 , @entity41 also played a producing role , and the film festival circuit seems to have fallen in love with the movie			1
filming , which happened in @entity13 and @entity135 , was intense , @entity7 said , especially filming @entity1 's speech at the state capital in @entity138			0
( the speeches in the film are approximations , because the @entity1 family reportedly blocked using the actual speeches			0
) @entity7 said he had an eerie feeling in the days leading up to it			0
" i felt this bizarre feeling of death around me , " he said			0
" he had consistently been told not to make that speech as there was a real fear of possible assassination			0
at the end of the day i felt almost surprised that i would be alive			0
i know that sounds strange , but i feel like i had so deeply entrenched myself that i could feel some of the fears he must have felt			0
" @entity7 prepped meticulously for the role : shaving his hairline back , gaining weight , losing his @entity21 accent , reading and studying film of @entity1			1
he 's humble about a possible best actor @entity163 ( he 's already been nominated for several other awards , including a @entity165 and a @entity166 ) , but said he is beyond satisfied with his performance			1
" i know i gave it everything i possibly could , " he said			0
" i am my own worst critic and the point beyond which i am happy to leave it alone is knowing there was n't one single thing i could do differently			0

the @entity21 actor is winning raves for his performance
he has a *spiritual* connection to the role
@entity99 calls the project " divine timing "
