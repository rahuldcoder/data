if you 're already a veteran hiker , @entity12 has several hiking recommendations for you			1
and if a hike looks to be too much for the beginner in your crowd , consider doing part of a longer hike , turning around and heading back to the starting point for a picnic or snack			2
raised on a mushroom farm in @entity28 , @entity12 would wander off into the woods for the day or take an overnight trip with his family and pitch a tent along the way			1
now executive director of the @entity36 's @entity35 , he hikes like most working people , often squeezing in a half - day or day hike on business trips			2
that 's why he started a blog dedicated to hiking experiences that do n't require endurance training			1
@entity12 wants to enjoy the experience and perhaps be in good condition for " a nice steak dinner and a glass of wine " he says			1
a hike that tortures his body ? not for him			2
" i 'm looking for a pleasant experience , not a 50 - mile death march , " he says			2

the mountain 's eight - mile circuit includes scrambling up rocks and is considered a little more difficult , but a fit 10 - year - old could do it , @entity12 says			1
" the reward is top of the mountain , a craggy peak that overlooks the @entity123 , " he says			0
the mountain is close to @entity113 , so it can get crowded on the weekends during peak fall foliage season			0
it is a challenging trail , especially for a complete novice			0

there 's a managed herd of elk within view			0
" there 's also the remains of an old dairy ranch still standing , " so you can imagine what it would have been like to live on this remote place on the @entity161 , " he says			1
