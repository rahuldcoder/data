-- october 16 marked @entity2 's 50th birthday , and the iconic bass player of the @entity4 held an event celebrating both his life and his life 's focus on giving back			1
an army of caterers scurried around his @entity13 backyard tuesday , preparing for a party that was a birthday bash as well as a fundraiser for the @entity17 , the nonprofit school flea co-founded 11 years ago			1
@entity2 's days of rock star excess are clearly over -- unless you count the silent auction , where a @entity22 drawing of a rat fetched $ 100,000 and a spirited bidding war erupted between actor @entity25 , musician @entity26 and producer @entity27 over a crayon - colored cashmere blanket that ultimately sold for $ 2,250			2
shortly before his guests arrived , @entity2 reflected on the first half - century of his life -- which has been just as colorful as the cashmere blanket that caused such a ruckus during the silent auction			2
with the @entity4 , he 's won seven @entity33 , pioneered a bold style of rock infused with funk and rap , overcome drug dependency and earned induction into the @entity40			1
on his own , @entity2 's found purpose and personal satisfaction in giving back			2
@entity0 : happy birthday , flea ! 50			1
how does it feel ? flea : outstanding ! i woke up this morning and i just felt so grateful for everything			1
@entity48 to be alive , grateful to be exactly where i am			1
i give and receive love every day , ( and ) i feel creatively vibrant			2
i have some great friends ; i feel like i 'm capable of giving a lot to the world			1
and ultimately , that 's what i really care about , is just giving			2
@entity0 : tonight you 're also holding a benefit for the @entity17 , which you co-founded 11 years ago			1
flea : the @entity17 is a nonprofit music school in @entity13 where we teach music , mostly to kids , but to people of all ages -- people who are old , people with beards , all kinds of people			1
but we teach all the orchestral instruments , all the band instruments , group lessons , private lessons , orchestra , adult choir , children 's choir , all kinds of music groups			2
and we 're not about fame or celebrity or anything like that			2
we 're academic , teaching theory and fundamentals of music and technique on a particular instrument			2
unfortunately , the public school system has cut the funding to music programs , and there 's a big void , so we 're doing our best to fill it in our community			2
@entity0 : what made you decide to bring the annual fundraiser to your own home this year ? flea : well , i 've done it before , but this is a special night tonight			1
we 've had incredible fine artists donate to our auction tonight -- @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity22 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107			2
some of the great people in the contemporary art world have come out to support our music education			1
the @entity4 are playing tonight , @entity111 is playing tonight , and it 's all happening in my backyard , and it 's my birthday			1
you know , 11 years ago we had the opening night for the school party and it was on my birthday			1
so it 's always an incredible birthday to have			1
in a minute , i 'm going to go shower , put on my suit , and it 's on			0
@entity0 : when you woke up this morning , did you reflect back ? flea : yeah , turning 50 is a little bit of a taking stock moment			1
i feel probably a little dumber			0
i do n't think i 'm as sharp as i was when i was younger , but i 'm definitely wiser , and less likely to make gigantic blunders of an intellectual , spiritual , emotional or physical type			0
less likely to do something dumb , but i 'm not as quick			0
i feel a little bit wiser , but more than anything the passion for the things that i really care about like playing music , and being kind , and children , and the things i love -- sports , books , art -- my passion for all these things has deepened			0
it just feels like there 's an infinite well of greatness to get into			0
i just feel like i go deeper and deeper into it			0
i feel like i have a profound spiritual life , as well			0
@entity0 : when you were young , did you ever think you would achieve the level of musical success that you 've had ? flea : no. i 've always kind of been an in - the - moment kind of person			1
i do n't think that far in advance or have any idea what 's around the next corner			0
i just kind of try to make the best decisions as they come up			0
and as life has gone on , i really have faith in that philosophy a lot			0
i really have faith that each thing that comes up is a gift , and i 'm grateful for the opportunity , whether it be a difficult thing or a fun thing			1
@entity0 : you 've been in the @entity4 for more than half your life			1
do you see yourself continuing with them for eternity ? flea : i love the @entity4 , and i would love to			1
if there 's anything i know , it 's every time you start making plans , you do n't know what 's going to come up next			0
so i love being in the @entity4 and it 's my home , and i 've been doing it for more than half my life			1
of course , during the course of doing it , there 's been all kinds of ups and downs , and moments of extreme ( positivity ) , floating on clouds of greatness , and times of just groveling , and misery , and uncertainty , and anger , and love and all those things			0
like being in a family			0
i really ca n't predict			0
but i love being in it for now , and right now , about as far as i 'm thinking is getting through this tour that we 're doing , performing at the highest level possible , then hunkering down and writing another record			0
@entity0 : you also keep busy with side projects			0
you performed with @entity207 a couple of days ago , then you have the @entity209 project			0
where is that going ? flea : wherever it goes , it goes			1
i 've been very fortunate to play with some great artists in my life , and @entity207 is one of them			0
i love her to death			0
i 'd do anything for her			0
and if she says , " flea , come play , " i come			2
she 's just the greatest			0
and my thing with @entity224 ( @entity225 from @entity226 ) , @entity209 -- @entity224 , and @entity227 ( @entity228 ) , and @entity229 ( @entity230 ) and @entity231 ( @entity232 ) -- is just fun , and i 'm grateful for that , as well			2
@entity0 : looking back on your 50 years , is there anything you 'd do differently ? flea : nothing ! @entity0 : it must be nice to wake up in the morning and think that			1
i 've made a billion mistakes , but i would n't have learned without making them			0
i needed to make errors , and misbehave , and be an insensitive , thoughtless person to work my hardest on becoming a kind , caring one			0
@entity0 : so when you blow out the candles on your birthday cake , what are you going to be wishing for ? flea : a @entity256 world championship .			1
