-- the web fallout continued friday over news that a hidden app could be tracking smartphone users ' activity			1
many bloggers and smartphone customers fretted about the privacy issues raised by @entity9 , an information - mining app secretly installed on many phones			1
but at the same time , other tech observers were beginning to say that some of those concerns may have been over the top			1
@entity16 , a recap : on monday , researcher and developer @entity18 posted a 17 - minute @entity21 video apparently showing how the software -- designed as a diagnostic tool to find and help fix mobile network problems -- runs on his smartphone and logs every keystroke , every text and the full url of every website he visits			1
news of the app 's existence on millions of phones had bounced around on tech blogs for a while			1
but attention skyrocketed this week when @entity18 posted his video			2
by thursday , it had turned into a rapidly developing story in which new information seemed to surface hourly			2
mobile carriers and smartphone makers rushed to dispute claims made by @entity18 and others who said they confirmed his findings , explain their use of the app or announce that they once used it but plan to get rid of it			1
and friday morning , the controversy made its way into the courts			0
a lawsuit was filed in the @entity56 against @entity9 , and phone makers @entity57 and @entity59 , claiming that the app violates customer privacy			1
" given our dependence on smartphones , we rely on the assumption that our personal information is protected from third parties , " attorney @entity62 said in a written statement			0
" yet , it appears that @entity9 has violated this trust			1
" @entity73 's firm is representing several customers and is seeking to turn the complaint into a class - action lawsuit			1
the potential ramifications obviously had other privacy - minded folks concerned as well			1
" a couple of things seem pretty clear , " @entity80 , a senior privacy and technology analyst with the @entity83 , said friday			0
" we do n't know what the company was storing or accessing or what their clients were storing or accessing , but they seem to at least have the capability to store and access a lot of very personal information			0
" many mobile customers seemed to focus their concerns on the fact that the software runs without their knowledge and appears difficult , if not impossible , to uninstall			1
for example , on @entity102 's community forums , several topics had been created to discuss the issue			0
and customers were n't happy			0
" there 's no excuse to knowingly and willingly want to have that kind of invasive software , that potentially puts customers sensitive information at risk , on the phone , " one customer wrote			0
" this software may violate multiple privacy laws , and that alone ought to void our contracts			0
" @entity102 said it uses the app to root out network problems but ca n't see user activity			1
other wireless carriers and smartphone manufacturers also responded			2
@entity124 said it does n't use the app , and @entity126 said it has stopped supporting it and plans to eliminate it altogether			2
by thursday morning , some on the @entity130 were trying to put the brakes on the fears , though			0
" okay , folks , before we complete this public lynching , is there any evidence that @entity9 actually transmitted inappropriate data ? " tweeted @entity133 , a correspondent for tech site @entity134			1
in a message posted to @entity143 , @entity144 , an analyst with @entity145 , wrote that some of the fears about @entity9 have been overblown			1
" after reverse engineering carrieriq myself , i have seen no evidence that they are collecting anything more than what they 've publicly claimed : anonymized metrics data , " he wrote			0
" there 's a big difference between ' look , it does something when i press a key ' and ' it 's sending all my keystrokes to the carrier ! '			2
' " " in my opinion , the media has made it more malicious than it really is and i am not concerned about my phone usage at all , " wrote @entity165 , a columnist with tech site @entity166			0
" it sounds to me like the software is designed to benefit consumers and is not being used to track and target you			2
" but the @entity83 's @entity80 remains concerned			0
he cited promotional material on @entity9 's own website that notes its ability to track users ' activities			1
" if you look at their website , we do n't know what their clients were buying , but we do know what they were selling , " he said			0
" what they 're saying to the media does n't seem to comport to what they tout on their own website			0
" @entity9 says the core purpose of its tool is to uncover broad trends across a network			1
its software can help carriers find out where calls are dropping and why , and zero in on device glitches			0
for at least some of those who remain concerned ( and there are no doubt many ) , there may be some hope of at least finding out if the app is running on their phones			2
a new app in the @entity212 , @entity213 detector , is designed to help you simply find the kit on your phone if it exists			2
it 's only a day old and not perfect , developers say , but will continue to be tweaked .			0
