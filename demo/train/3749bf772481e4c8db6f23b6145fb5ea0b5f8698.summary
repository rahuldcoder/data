nothing says " sore loser " like threatening to leave the country after an election defeat			2
and that 's what hundreds of thousands of @entity5 have done by petitioning for their states ' secession on the @entity11 website			1
it 's reminiscent of the great @entity14 tradition of right - wing celebrities threatening to leave the @entity14 if the @entity16 wins power			2
alas , they never do			0
from the demography and geography of the vast majority of signers , it 's tempting to conclude that this is just a @entity25 cry of rage against four more years of president @entity27			1
but it 's more significant than that			2
@entity30 away the right - wing fantasies about whether or not secession is really possible ( it is n't ) , and you have a movement that testifies to the extraordinary divisions within @entity5 politics			1
the far right feels angry and dispossessed			0
rather than getting even , it 's threatening to run away			2
if it were n't for the sheer number of signatures , the media would n't be paying attention			0
gov. @entity42 of @entity43 describes the secession movement as " silly " and gov. @entity45 of @entity46 has dismissed it , too			1
@entity48 columnist @entity47 points out that many of the petitioners live in states that are net beneficiaries of federal largesse : @entity43 gets $ 1.45 for every $ 1 it pays in taxes and @entity56 gets $ 1.71 for every $ 1			0
given how much they take from the less mutinous states , he cheekily suggests that the secession petitions " give the opportunity to create what would be , in a fiscal sense , a far more perfect union			2
" meanwhile , the @entity65 notes that the secession effort has attracted a predictable rogues ' gallery of racists and neo-nazis			2
given that there was no similar large - scale effort to secede when @entity73 , @entity74 or @entity75 won re-election , liberals ca n't be blamed for detecting a particular white fury at @entity27 's success			2
legally , secession is impossible , and all attempts to do it have failed			2
but it 's not a philosophically unattractive idea			1
a democratic society works best when it 's rooted in the principle of free association : we all get along with one another because we choose to			2
good will is maintained because the individual 's membership in the community is voluntary -- were it compulsory , that would breed resentment			0
but free association only works so long as the individual is free to disassociate when he or she wants			0
as with individuals , so with nations			0
in the case of the @entity5 , the states are historically there by choice			1
although there is no mechanism for secession , the generous distribution of powers to the states reflects a spirit of voluntary federation			0
since the end of the @entity114 we 've witnessed the surprising fluidity of supposedly fixed national identities			0
the @entity117 broke up , adding 15 new countries to the map			0
@entity120 witnessed terrible wars for national self - determination			0
@entity123 is on the permanent brink of fracture			0
and my native @entity126 is getting ready for a historic vote on the independence of @entity130			0
the complexities of @entity130 independence illustrate that secession does n't have to mean a violent rupture sparked by right - wing nationalism			0
the domestic program of the @entity130 nationalist movement is broadly liberal ; it will seek to join the @entity138 and its leaders often insist that the @entity130 people will remain culturally @entity14			0
in @entity143 's case , the motor for secession is ethnicity			1
in @entity5 , however , it 's a politics turned toxic			1
the 2012 election encouraged the idea that the @entity5 is split into two camps that are politically and culturally alien and with opposing economic needs			1
@entity153 's infamous formula of the 47 % ( reiterated in his equally ugly post-election remarks about " gifts " ) played upon an old idea that one half of the country feeds off the taxes paid by the other half			1
secessionists are likely to be those who see themselves as disadvantaged by the redistributive federal state : as taxpayers bled dry by freeloaders , and businesspeople penalized by liberal regulation			0
@entity167 found an eccentric example of that when it interviewed the founder of the @entity56 petition and discovered that he was furious at the government for shutting down his topless car wash : " he said he was arrested and charged with obscenity by city officials in 2001			0
' the government ripped my business away , and now they 're choking @entity5 to death with rules and regulations , ' he said			1
" but the 2012 election introduced the idea that the welfare - recipient minority is now the majority			1
a common theme in conservative post-election analysis is that the @entity188 now have an unbeatable coalition of ethnic minorities , single women and socially liberal youth that is turning the @entity5 into a @entity143 social democracy			1
( @entity194 : " tuesday 's results demonstrate that , as a whole , the @entity5 electorate is trending very @entity198			1
" ) if that is the consensus among the conservative talking heads , then it 's rational for conservative grass - roots activists to conclude that the only viable future for the conservative minority is to form its own country			1
the call for secession will be mocked and dismissed			0
but while it is built on a legal fallacy , it does articulate honestly the feelings of a growing number of conservatives who feel emasculated in 21st century @entity5			1
it 's now the duty of the @entity25 to try to integrate them back into mainstream , legitimate politics .			1

@entity218 : secession movement reveals real feelings of some conservatives
he says it 's not realistic , but still shows far right 's feeling of dispossession in @entity5 politics
he says election stoked idea of two @entity231 ; conservatives fear they are the new minority
@entity218 : @entity25 must integrate secession group into mainstream , legitimate politics
