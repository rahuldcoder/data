@entity2 , we can all agree , has a lot going for it			1
it has splendid museums , grand avenues , a famous pointy tower and thousands of cafes where you can order a minuscule coffee for a fairly large amount of money			0
but @entity13 is a supremely qualified rival			1
in @entity13 , a hearty serving of tradition smaller it may be , but @entity19 's second city has a sophistication that makes it a hugely intriguing option for visitors			1
while the following suggestions may cause rioting ( or , at least , mild shrugs of indifference ) along the @entity28 , there are a number of ways @entity13 outshines the @entity19 capital			1
wine just about everyone in @entity19 loves wine			1
but in contrast to @entity2 -- which sips anything fruity put in front of it , but does n't produce anything of its own -- @entity13 brings a bottle to the party			1
@entity13 is the gateway to the @entity48 viticultural region , which fans out immediately to the northwest			2
from @entity13 , you can explore these whispering vineyards yourself			2
or you can take the easy route and make a few wise purchases in the excellent wine shops around the city			0
@entity57 does flavorsome reds and whites , while @entity61 des @entity60 is hardly short on confidence when it comes to the contents of its stock list			0
@entity67 @entity2 's @entity68 is an inimitable @entity19 icon , especially if you like long lines and pigeons			1
@entity13 's @entity72 -- the basilica of @entity72 -- is , simply , a more beautiful church			1
a young maiden ( built 1872 - 1884 ) compared with @entity2 's grande dame ( built 1163 - 1345 ) , she sits prettily atop the city 's main hill , offering views down to the riverside streets below , and , on clear days , across to the snowcaps of the @entity82			1
outdoor music @entity13 knows how to put on a summer extravaganza			2
the @entity86 festival sees 60 or so shows -- rock , classical music , drama -- stretched across the warm evenings of june and july			0
alumni of this wide showcase include @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
the 2014 lineup includes @entity19 pop stalwarts @entity99 and @entity101 indie veterans the @entity98			2
better than any band , though , is a setting that @entity2 ca n't match			2
the @entity19 capital may have modern venues befitting its size and status , but it ca n't dance the night away as if @entity108 were still in the posh seats			2
the majority of the @entity86 performances take place amid the sturdy tiers of @entity13 's main @entity115 amphitheater , which dates to 15 b.c. 4			1
cinematic history @entity2 has been in many movies			2
" " midnight in @entity2			2
" but @entity13 pretty much invented the movies			2
or , at least , two of its most famous sons did			0
@entity123 and @entity124 are credited with creating the first film camera ( the cinematograph ) in 1892			1
you can pay tribute to their vision at @entity13 's @entity131 , with its museum and cinema			1
food @entity2 is very good at cuisine			0
it 's just that @entity13 believes it 's better			1
its restaurants include @entity137 , a fabled temple of @entity139 gastronomy which has three @entity141 stars			0
it 's overseen by @entity19 uber - chef @entity142 , who is now 88 , but still a master at his signature truffle soup			1
then there 's @entity145 , which exists under the gaze of @entity147			0
the restaurant has two @entity141 stars , but @entity150 is only 46 , so can be excused his shortfall			0
parks @entity2 does n't have a large central green space -- unless you count the @entity155 , which are predominantly surfaced in gravel , and are therefore white			0
but @entity13 has the @entity157 , which -- with its 117 hectares of grass and trees -- cozies up to the @entity160 in the sixth arrondissement			0
here , you can go boating on the lake , cycle along winding pathways , or simply lie in the shade and remark on the fact that this metropolitan lung 's name -- @entity171 -- sounds a bit silly in @entity173			0
roman history in numbers , this is basically a tie			0
@entity177 stomped his sandals into the fledgling @entity2 in 52 @entity179 ; @entity13 had its first date with expansionist toga - wearing proto - @entity181 when it was founded as @entity183 a decade later in 43 b.c. but @entity13 was the more important city under @entity115 rule -- a teacher 's pet that became @entity188 's head boy in ancient @entity189			1
@entity13 's @entity115 structures are almost as impressive today as they were in the days of the gladiators -- especially the remnants of its public baths and the giant amphitheater on @entity196 at the @entity197			1
rivers why did the @entity199 plonk @entity183 onto the map where they did ? because the place was ideal for a settlement			0
west of the @entity82 , it was a decent stop - off point halfway up @entity19 and not too far from the mother city			1
but above that , because it had -- and has -- two rivers			0
the @entity160 , which is so long that it has to travel from @entity212 , curves through the center of @entity13			0
the two meet in the aptly titled district of @entity217			0
@entity2 , by contrast , has just one river , the @entity220			1
ah , c'est dommage .			0

@entity13 is @entity19 's " second city " but it leads the way in a number of cultural categories
@entity2 has @entity72 but @entity13 's @entity72 is more beautiful
@entity2 has one river ; @entity13 has two
@entity13 's @entity124 are credited with creating the first film camera
