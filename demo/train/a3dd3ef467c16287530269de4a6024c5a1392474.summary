" we are in panic mode , " said @entity12 , an illegal immigrant living in @entity13			1
the law known as @entity17 is the strictest in the country , allowing police officers to ask about the legal status of people investigated for a crime , if reasonable suspicion exists , and detain them for immigration authorities			1
" we can not even go out and buy food , " said @entity26 , who has lived in @entity5 for the past five years without legal status			1

" i 'm not afraid for myself , " said @entity36 , who has two @entity38 - born children			1
" if they want to deport me , that is fine			0

@entity69 , the interim superintendent of the @entity70 , said in a news conference friday that schools will comply with the law , checking the status of new students , but that nobody will be denied an education			2
@entity12 said that like herself , her children are undocumented , and she is afraid of the consequences of sending them to school			1
" they are going to investigate us through our children , " she said			2
late friday , the @entity38 @entity85 and the other plaintiffs filed a motion to enjoin the law until the 11th @entity89 in @entity90 has a chance to review the appeal			1

" we expect people to be here in the state of @entity5 legally			2
we have open arms , we have all the hospitality we can muster for the people who come to the state of @entity5 legally			2
but if you are here illegally , it 's going to be a challenge , " he said			2
some immigrants are also planning for the worst			0
the owner of a @entity115 food store , who asked not to be identified because he came to the @entity38 illegally , was worried that he could not stay open			1

but even if he stays in business , he 's facing tougher times			0
he says sales dropped by half after @entity131 was first introduced and dropped even more when it was signed			0

late thursday , a rumor began circulating among neighbors in a trailer park where many hispanics live			0
in a few minutes , streets emptied and people called friends and family to warn them of a potential threat that never came .			0
