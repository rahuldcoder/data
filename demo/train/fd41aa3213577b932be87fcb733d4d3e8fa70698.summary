-- the " mommy wars " that have cropped up repeatedly this campaign season are a figment of political pundits ' imagination			2
the most recent example , of course , was the political and media tempest that followed @entity12 strategist @entity11 's comment that @entity15 , @entity16 's wife and a mother of five , had not " worked a day in her life			1
" many made political hay with the remark			0
the truth is most women are n't fighting about this			1
they know that work is involved to make everyday life happen : the feeding , and clothing and caring for oneself and one 's family , whether earning the money to buy the clothes and food , or being at home , washing those clothes or cooking dinner			1
all mothers work , nearly all of the time			2
and so do many fathers			0
but there is a serious issue hidden in the silliness of the alleged mommy wars , and it is the contradictory , conflicting beliefs we have about the value of taking time to care for other people			2
who should take care of young people and their grandparents , and how should they be rewarded ? we claim to value families , but we do n't really value what it takes to care for them			2
let me give you some examples : contradiction # 1 : everyone seems to agree that women and men should have equal rights			2
but when was the last time you heard someone say that a man should make fatherhood a " career " ? it is true today that sometimes , men do become stay - at - home dads , but even in the consciously feminist families i wrote about in my book , " @entity76 , " men share the " work " of raising their children ; i did n't interview one man who described fatherhood as a career			1
and it took me a long time to find couples that really shared the work equally			2
there are blogs to help parents equally share the work ( like @entity92 and @entity93 's blog ) , but if parenting is truly the socially valued career choice that politicians on both sides of the political spectrum claim , why do so few men identify fatherhood as their primary career ? contradiction # 2 : everyone seems to agree that parenting involves sophisticated emotional and psychological skills and not merely grunt work			1
but if people truly believe that , why does @entity110 sociologist @entity109 and her colleagues find time and time again that mothers are discriminated against in hiring and promotions ? contradiction # 3 : everyone seems to agree that @entity118 supports " family values			0
" but research published in this month 's @entity121 shows that women who breast - feed for six months or more pay a mommy penalty in wages for the rest of their lives because of the lack of work policies that protect employed women 's right to breast - feed on the job			1
why does n't the @entity118 institute the same protections for women 's right to breast - feed as other @entity137 industrial countries ? contradiction # 4 : everyone seems to agree that when women married to men of means choose to be stay - at - home moms , they are doing so for the good of their children			1
but when poor women , without access to first - rate child care , choose to stay home with their babies , we tend to call them lazy welfare mothers			0
our social policy of providing only very " temporary assistance to needy families " comes with the built - in insistence that they take personal responsibility for their children , meaning they should get themselves a low - wage job , often with no choice but to leave their children in less than optimal child care			0
sociologist @entity165 pointed out these contradictions back in 1953			0
she argued back then that if society truly believed caretaking was an important and difficult job , nursery school teachers would rate a salary at least equal to the beginning salary of a street cleaner			1
not much has changed since then			0
as @entity174 , a historian and co-chair of the @entity176 , told me : " it 's time for politicians to stop competing over the women 's votes and start competing over who has the best programs to support all parents , whatever their employment status or their gender			1
" why all these contradictions ? because we have a society in flux			0
we have inherited both workplace cultures and beliefs from a time in our past when successful men had wives to take care of their homes and children			0
workplaces got two employees for the price of one , the husband and his domestic wife			0
unions fought for " family wages " so working - class men could benefit from women 's household work as well			1
that 's not the world we live in today			0
now , for better or worse , most mothers of young children -- married and single -- work both inside and outside their homes			0
their workplaces , and our cultural conversation full of contradictions , has lagged far behind			0
let 's call a truce on the fictional mommy wars and start a war on workplaces that do n't allow mommies and daddies to live full lives , on the job and at home			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			1

@entity232 : " @entity235 wars " are cooked up by politicians and media , not everyday women
she says women know well the conflicts society presents them over value of their work
she says women told job of mothering is valued , so why do n't dads make it a " career ? "
women face discrimination over mother choices , @entity232 says ; workplaces must catch up
