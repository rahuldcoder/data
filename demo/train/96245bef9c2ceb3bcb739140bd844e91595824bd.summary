@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is reeling from its most severe drought in 70 years with the nation 's reservoirs on average just half full , the @entity3 reports			1
the tower of a former church , underwater before the drought , reappears in the @entity12 reservoir			0
rainfall has been less than half of what 's considered normal for the last six months and reservoir levels were already low after two years in which normal rain levels failed to rebound from the driest 12 months on record -- october 1 , 2004 to september 30 , 2005			1
the worst - hit areas are the @entity22 region -- whose capital , @entity25 , is the nation 's second - largest city -- and central @entity1 in the @entity29 region near @entity0 , according to @entity30 , a climate specialist at the @entity32 in @entity0			1
the @entity34 reservoir near @entity25 is about 20 percent full , and in some places it appears to be bone dry			1
a little row boat could this week be seen resting on the sandy dirt bottom of the reservoir			0
in a nearby village , @entity41 , trucks already bring drinking water every week because the town 's three wells are too dry			0
it 's become a political headache for @entity49 prime minister @entity48 , who is just starting his second term			0
" despite the difficult drought years , " @entity48 said in the investiture debate in parliament , " there 's been no shortage of drinking water anywhere in the country			0
" but @entity25 might run out by october			2
the government has decided to quickly build a water pipeline for 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) along the major @entity61 - 7 highway , to pump water in to @entity25 , if necessary by the autumn and depending on reservoir levels at that time			1
the project would cost 180 million euros ( $ 280 million )			0
the water would come from the @entity66 and that has sparked protests from the regional governments of @entity70 and @entity71 , down the @entity73 coast from @entity25 , that the central government is favoring @entity25			1
@entity70 and @entity71 leaders this week threatened to take the case to the @entity77 , the highest in @entity1			2
@entity25 - area officials already have restricted the use of water for home gardens and parks and public fountains			1
they have also considered bringing drinking water in by boat			0
to tackle chronic water shortages , @entity1 in recent years has also invested heavily in desalination plants , which take the salt of sea water to make it drinkable -- but several are not yet finished , including one that would serve @entity25			1
the latest drought hits @entity1 just after tens of thousands of new vacation homes have sprung up en masse along the coast in recent years , along with dozens of new golf courses thirsting to stay green			1
" the amount of water resources depend not only on precipitation , but also on consumption , " @entity30 said			0
" the water demand in @entity1 has increased a lot in the last 10 or 15 years			2
" despite recent showers , the past six months are the driest period in @entity1 in 70 years , when record - keeping began , @entity30 said			1
farmers also compete for the water , to irrigate their fields , which are suffering in the latest drought			0
some critics say that successive @entity1 governments have repeatedly taken short term measures during droughts , rather than making long - term water - use plans			2
one old fisherman at the @entity114 - an hour north of @entity0 and just a third full despite the recent rains - said he 'd never seen it so bad			2
" we 'd have so much progress , " said @entity117 , the 78 - year - old fisherman , " but we 're doing badly			0
" to make matters worse , he did n't catch any fish that day -- which he also blamed on the drought			0
