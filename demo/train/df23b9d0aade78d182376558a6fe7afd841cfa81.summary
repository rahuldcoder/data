-- in march 2009 , when i was detained in @entity3 in @entity4 , two evangelical christians were arrested			2
i never met them but spotted them a few times through the barred window of my cell as they walked back and forth to the bathroom down the hall			0
i would later learn that @entity11 and @entity12 had converted from @entity13 to @entity14 and faced charges of spreading propaganda against the @entity17 , insulting religious sanctities , and committing apostasy			1
they resisted severe pressure to renounce their faith , and in november 2009 , after an international outcry , the two women went free			0
news headlines are now highlighting the plight of another @entity4 @entity14 accused of apostasy , or abandoning one 's religion			1
when pastor @entity32 was 19 , he converted from @entity13 to @entity14			1
in 2010 , a provincial court sentenced him to death			2
this year , @entity4 's @entity35 ruled that the case should be reviewed and the sentence overturned if he recants his faith -- a step @entity32 , 34 , has so far refused to take			1
now , according to the @entity42 , @entity4 's judiciary has ordered the verdict to be delayed , possibly for one year			1
but @entity32 's supporters hope sustained worldwide pressure will lead to his just and immediate release			2
as international criticism has mounted , an @entity4 official has alleged that @entity32 is being prosecuted not for his faith but for crimes including rape and extortion			1
@entity32 's attorney , however , says the only charge the pastor has faced is apostasy , and court documents support this assertion			1
although @entity4 's penal code does not include a specific provision for apostasy , judges are given a fairly wide degree of latitude to issue rulings based on their own interpretation of islamic law			1
in the past this has led to punishments ranging from imprisonment to death			0
the last person officially executed in @entity4 for apostasy was @entity74 , a @entity75 minister who converted from @entity13 before @entity4 's @entity76 and was hanged in 1990			1
@entity4 officials often say their country 's recognized religious minorities ( @entity78 , jews , and adherents of the ancient @entity83 religion of @entity84 ) enjoy freedoms equal to their @entity87 counterparts			2
@entity4 's constitution gives these three religious minorities certain rights , such as five seats in the 290 - member parliament and the freedom to perform their religious rituals			1
the constitution 's articles , however , are all set within the boundaries of @entity13 , and @entity13 codes grant superior legal status to male @entity101			0
many non-shiites in @entity4 have also complained of limits on education , work , and exercising their faith			2
critics accuse the @entity13 regime of having monitored , harassed , abducted , detained , tortured , and killed citizens based upon their religion			0
since 1999 , the @entity111 has designated @entity4 a " country of particular concern " because of religious repression			0
the @entity111 has focused on the treatment of @entity116 and @entity101 , @entity118 evangelical christians , jews , @entity120 who do n't share the government 's official views , and @entity123 , whose faith is not recognized by @entity4 's regime			1
@entity14 leaders in @entity4 have usually blunted their criticism of the regime , in part to avoid tensions			1
when i attended @entity132 in @entity4 four years ago , i saw a few dozen worshipers , but i also heard that they had to get government permission to hold the service and were not allowed to proselytize			0
they had a @entity14 school , but it had to have a @entity87 principal			0
they could print @entity14 texts but only with the authorities ' approval			0
a number of @entity4 @entity78 who recently left @entity4 have told me that since the country 's 2009 disputed presidential election , pressure on their communities has intensified , prompting many more @entity78 to emigrate			2
in april , the @entity147 reported a rise in @entity4 authorities raiding church services and harassing worshipers			0
evangelicals and other protestants have been particularly targeted			0
unlike @entity4 's traditionally recognized @entity14 minorities , such as @entity156 , @entity157 , and @entity158 , evangelical churches hold their services in the @entity161 language			1
@entity4 authorities accuse them of spreading @entity14 writings in @entity161 to convert @entity101			1
" they are tough on us because we educate others , " a former pastor of an underground evangelical church in @entity4 told me on condition of anonymity			2
" they call it proselytizing , but we do n't proselytize			0
we discuss the realities that @entity173 talks about in the @entity174 , and we never speak about the @entity17			0
" shortly after their release from prison , @entity11 and @entity12 , the two @entity14 converts detained down the corridor from me , left @entity4			1
if they stayed , they may have shared the tragic fate of the rev. @entity182			0
@entity182 , a @entity14 convert from @entity13 , was jailed for a decade and released in 1994 after international appeals			0
soon afterward , he went missing			0
the authorities reported the discovery of his corpse in a wooded area west of @entity188			0
@entity4 's government blamed an anti-regime group for the murder			1
if the @entity4 regime wants to tout religious freedom , it should respect its citizens ' right to decide one of life 's most personal choices : their spiritual path			2
a regime that claims to observe human rights and base its actions on the peaceful nature of @entity13 should also explain how peace would be attained by executing a man whose only crime is his faith			2
by releasing @entity32 before @entity132 , @entity188 would take an important step toward respect for human rights and would give his wife and children an unforgettable gift			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity32 was sentenced to death in @entity4 , says @entity216
the 34 - year - old pastor converted to @entity14 at 19 , @entity216 says
@entity216 : @entity4 's last official execution for apostasy *occurred* in 1990
by freeing @entity32 , @entity4 would show respect for human rights , she says
