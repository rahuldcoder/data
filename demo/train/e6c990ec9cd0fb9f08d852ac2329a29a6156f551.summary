-- there 's nothing broken about being the fourth-most valuable company in the world , which is exactly what @entity5 is today			1
that same company , however , is valued at half what it was 10 years ago			2
it 's not exactly thriving , either			2
regardless if the glass is actually half empty or half full , consumer confidence in @entity5 is at a low			1
it is ignored or considered uncool by younger generations			1
older generations are often required to use the company 's software at work , but turn to @entity20 or @entity22 devices in their free time			1
a month from now @entity5 will release @entity24 8 , a bold new operating system that seeks to bring touchscreen interfaces to desktop computing			1
it 's the company 's biggest product since @entity30 and yet the only thing the tech world has seemingly talked about over the last 12 months is what the @entity33 might look like			1
in that sense , @entity5 is broken			1
sure , the company that @entity37 built has had a few bona fide hits over the last decade , most notably from its gaming division : @entity40 , which is sort of the nighttime @entity42 for gamers , and @entity44 , a hands - free game controller that caught fire for a year before fizzling somewhat			2
@entity48 , @entity5 's search engine , also is gaining traction in the market			1
but when it comes to mobile devices -- the biggest area of growth in consumer tech -- @entity5 still lags behind its rivals			1
how @entity20 's story is like ' @entity59 ' so how can the company right the ship ? according to some of its biggest critics , here are eight ways @entity5 can reinvent itself , return to relevancy and dominate the tech world once more instead of just following it			1
make fewer things extremely well			0
@entity5 has been accused of many things			1
being too focused is n't one of them			0
" they spread themselves too thin across too many product lines , " says blogger @entity74 , a longtime observer of the company			2
" they let broken products hang on for far too long , " resulting in mediocre stuff that few people care about , she says			1
the good news : " they 're getting better at this , " @entity74 says			0
move all their software to the @entity88			1
@entity5 is in a bit of a pickle			1
consumers want to manage , view and manipulate their files from any device connected to the @entity95 ( aka cloud computing )			0
but @entity5 still makes most of its money from locally installed software , so it has been very reluctant to offer its wares online at a discount ( if not for free like @entity22 )			1
keep it up , though , and @entity5 will be a goner , says @entity101 , editor of @entity102			1
" on phones and tablets , @entity5 's presence is insignificant or too low to quantify			1
if the so - called post-pc era is about cloud - connected devices , @entity5 operating systems have no meaningful presence			1
@entity5 has made a fortune selling desktop operating systems			1
while the desktop will certainly remain an important computing tool for the foreseeable future , it 's no longer the primary tool			0
it 's really just one of many available portals now			0
" who cares about a desktop ? " says my twenty - something brother - in - law			0
so long as a device is portable and lets him access the @entity95 , he does n't care who makes it or what it looks like			0
so , in addition to moving all its products online , @entity5 should make those products available on any device , independent of the operating system , like @entity22 does across @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity24 and even their new @entity138 in other words , it 's all about the apps , regardless of how you access them			1
whether fair or not , the perception exists that @entity5 largely follows what @entity20 and @entity22 do rather than making its own waves ( think delayed @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , surface tablets and retail stores )			1
@entity151 , even @entity44 was a reaction to @entity153 's @entity152			0
to really excite consumers , it would do well to try zigging while others zag			0
" even if @entity5 fails to be as successful during the cloud - connected device era as the pc , its efforts ( good or bad ) should pressure @entity20 , @entity157 , @entity22 and others do to better , " says @entity101			1
the last thing @entity5 needs right now is to further reduce its already dwindling market share			2
yet that 's what the upcoming @entity165 might do as it tries to serve both touch users and traditional keyboard and mouse ones			0
" i fear @entity165 is too focused on touch - friendly computing , " says @entity170 , editor of @entity171			0
@entity74 agrees : " i think @entity5 may be too far ahead of its users in its decision to de-emphasize the old and familiar @entity24 for a touch - centric one			1
" it 's ok to offer both touch and traditional software , as @entity20 does			2
but it works best when you keep ' em separated ( as @entity20 has done with @entity135 and @entity181 )			0
be " cool " in its own way			0
as dominant as @entity5 was in the ' 90s , its products were never a status symbol like @entity20 's are today			1
at the same time , there are varying degrees of coolness ; you do n't have to be hip so long as you 're confident and unapologetic about who you are			0
the sooner @entity5 realizes this , the better it will embrace its potential as a respected and reliable maker of computing again , rather than just something the establishment makes you use			2
what 's more , @entity5 is now in the ironic position to brand itself as @entity200 to @entity20 's @entity201 , the counterculture to @entity20 's mainstream			1
you know , turn the tables on the very upstart company that used to " think different , " but that now suffers from groupthink because its products are so widely used			2
do n't do what @entity209 did			0
@entity209 used to be a household name in computing			0
after it stopped selling to consumers , it found success in targeting big business			0
but it is less relevant and smaller than it used to be			0
this will also remain true of @entity5 if it fails to embrace the cloud - connected devices that are replacing @entity221 " if @entity5 retreats to the enterprise and cedes the consumer market , like @entity209 , they 'll lose their relevance , " says @entity101			2
be the developer 's favorite again			0
@entity24 did n't become a juggernaut by being a better experience than @entity135			2
it became a juggernaut because it offered third - party developers more money , which in turn resulted in more programs , which in turn brought in more users			0
" the roles are reversed , " says @entity101			0
" where are the most exciting apps today ? not @entity24			2
they are on @entity136 and @entity181			0
" if @entity5 wants to dominate once more , it will need to entice more developer support to ensnare more consumers			2
as for the company 's chances , insider opinion ranges from ok to great			2
" i think it has enough cash reserves to swing and miss a few times and still come out looking good , " says @entity170			0
" but i do n't know if it will ever regain the top spot			0
" @entity74 shares his skepticism			0
" i 'm not sure they can ever be a consumer powerhouse , " she says			0
" do three rights undo 10 years of wrongs ? i do n't know			0
" @entity101 , on the other hand , says he 's seen other decimated companies regain their luster -- most notably @entity5 's longtime rival from @entity259			1
" if @entity20 can rise from near ruin in 15 years to become the world 's largest company , surely @entity5 can			1
