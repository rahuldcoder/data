-- " @entity1 , " the latest film in " @entity3 " is doing record business at the box office			1
in its opening weekend the film grossed $ 140.7 million -- more than any other film with an autumn release in history			1
the tales of teenage vampire love based on the best - selling books by @entity13 have wooed film - goers without having to resort to acres of flesh being on display			2
this distinct lack of on - screen sex runs contrary to the popular trend of portraying teenagers on screen as playing fast and loose with their virginity and affections			2
love and the importance of relationships most definitely rule in " @entity3 " and the formula is proving popular with audiences			1
@entity29 , communications professor at the @entity30 and author of " @entity32 " thinks that this more sensitive approach is the key to the film 's success			0
" a lot of people ask ' what 's so appealing about the @entity32 and why is it popular now ? ' and we think it 's because of the relationships and the messages about love in @entity32			0
in a more conservative environment we 've had this push for abstinence education , so we now have a media message that 's more congruent with that			0
so perhaps some teens relate to it in that way , " @entity29 told @entity0 's @entity50			0
the director of " @entity1 " @entity53 says that sexual abstinence is central to the film 's appeal			1
" it 's not that they ca n't have sex , they choose not to and i think there 's so much popular culture that 's saying to young people : ' you 'll be cool if you have sex ' or ' it 's important to be sexy ' whereas this series really concentrates on matters of the heart and spirit and i think that 's lovely , " @entity53 told @entity0			1
a dashing male lead , in the shape of @entity75 does n't hurt either when you 're trying to attract a female teenage audience			0
but whatever the exact recipe for its undoubted success it looks like teenagers in the " @entity32 " world do n't like to bite off more than they can chew .			0
