@entity0 -- at the end of his career , former house speaker @entity2 was asked how @entity5 had changed between the 1950s and 1980s			1
@entity2 answered : " the people are better			1
" watching last week 's health summit , you see what @entity2 meant			1
the conversation was intelligent , civil , well - informed			1
it also predictably achieved nothing			1
how could it ? deals are never reached in front of the television camera			1
name the most important legislation enacted in the 30 years between 1950 and 1980			1
@entity20 is n't it ? civil rights			1
the deregulation of the airlines , natural gas , trucking , rail and oil			1
the immigration act of 1965			1
@entity34 , @entity35 , and the @entity36			1
i could fill the whole screen			1
now ... the next 30 years			1
there 's the @entity42 tax cuts of course			1
deregulation of the savings & loans in 1982			2
@entity49 else ? leave aside whether you are liberal or conservative , whether you approve the measures mentioned above or disapprove			2
it 's hard to dispute : @entity5 just got a lot more done in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s than in the 1980s , 1990s and 2000s			1
why ? you hear many grand , sweeping explanations			2
let 's try just one simple one			2
@entity5 in the first period was controlled by a handful of committee chairmen , who owed their positions to seniority			2
the committees did their work in secret			1
bills written in committee typically could not be amended on the floor of @entity5			1
the institution was authoritarian , hierarchical , opaque			2
in the mid- 1970s , @entity5 underwent a revolution			1
the power of the committee chairmen was broken			2
the number of subcommittees proliferated			2
the committees met in public			2
@entity5 become more open , more egalitarian , more responsive			2
and stuff ceased to pass			2
again and again , today 's gridlock can be traced to yesterday 's reform			2
is the filibuster grinding @entity5 to a halt ? before the 1970s , filibusters were both very rare and very difficult			1
but when @entity5 took action to make filibusters easier to break , it inadvertently made them easier to use			0
back in the 1950s , a filibuster would bring the entire @entity90 to a halt , as the filibustering @entity92 talked and talked and talked			0
a filibuster was both spectacularly visible and personally exhausting : it exacted a high price from the filibustering senator			0
then @entity5 took action to make filibusters easier to break , requiring only 60 votes instead of 67			0
but that same deal made them much easier to start			0
no need to speechify all night ; no colleagues enraged that the filibustering senator has paralyzed the chamber			0
today , a filibustering senator need only notify the majority leader of his intention			0
the filibustered legislation is sidetracked until 60 votes are found to enact it , while other business continues as normal			1
the price of the filibuster has been drastically cut			0
no surprise we get more of them			0
candidates consumed by fundraising ? two generations ago , candidates barely raised money at all			0
once nominated , a candidate would turn to his party apparatus to provide the money and expertise needed to contest an election			0
but the maximum contribution by a party organization was capped in the 1940s , and it has not been raised significantly since			0
this cap was supposed to clean up politics by weakening party bosses			0
instead , it has forced every individual member of @entity5 to spend the bulk of his or her time begging for funds -- the very opposite of clean politics			0
lobbyists everywhere ? in 1950 , a lobbyist who wanted a tax measure would have very few targets			0
the chairman of the @entity139 could help , ditto the ranking member of the opposition party			0
the senior members of the @entity143 would likewise be worth talking to			0
maybe some of the upper level officials at @entity145			0
the days of concentrated power have ended			0
today , almost any one of the 535 members of @entity5 could help -- and so of course the interests must employ many more lobbyists to woo them all			0
@entity5 utterly polarized ? @entity153 , members of @entity5 did their business mostly in secret			1
they struck quiet deals with each other			1
a @entity158 might support a @entity160 labor measure in return for some discreet help with a farm bill			0
today , everything happens in the bright glare of sunshine , policed by hundreds of ideological interest groups			0
deviate one step from the party line , and you are a traitor , a sell - out , an enemy			0
just ask @entity174 , yesterday 's @entity158 hero , today a villain for voting against the filibuster of a jobs bill			0
we have an ideology that more publicity , more transparency , more openness must improve @entity5			1
and when each successive wave of openness makes things worse , we tell ourselves that the answer is even more publicity , transparency and openness still			1
no contrary evidence makes any impression			0
seems like everything 's open -- except our minds			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			1

in ' 50s and ' 60s , *landmark* bills were passed through secret deals , @entity197 says
reforms of the 1970s resulted in much more transparency , he says
@entity197 says the result has been that very little major legislation can get accomplished
