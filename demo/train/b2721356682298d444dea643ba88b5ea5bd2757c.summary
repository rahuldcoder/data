" " while the @entity10 community has the right to build the mosque , they are abusing that right by needlessly offending so many people who have suffered so much , " @entity57 said in a statement			2

" so i understand the emotions that this issue engenders			0
ground zero is , indeed , hallowed ground			0
" but @entity2 said one " reason that we will win this fight " against terrorism is " our capacity to show not merely tolerance , but respect to those who are different from us -- a way of life that stands in stark contrast to the nihilism of those who attacked us on that september morning , and who continue to plot against us today			2
" repeatedly invoking the nation 's founders and examples of religious tolerance from @entity121 history , the president argued that national ideals and the @entity123 demanded that the project proceed			0
he noted that @entity125 hosted the the first @entity127 dinner at the @entity16 more than 200 years ago and said that the country had previously seen " controversies about the construction of synagogues or catholic churches			2
" " but time and again , " he said , " the @entity121 people have demonstrated that we can work through these issues			0
" " this is @entity121 , and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable , " @entity2 said			2
" the principle that people of all faiths are welcome in this country , and will not be treated differently by their government , is essential to who we are			0
the writ of our founders must endure			0
" the proposed @entity6 center has provoked vocal opposition from some families of 9/11 victims and other groups			0
nearly 70 percent of @entity121 oppose the plan , according to @entity153 released wednesday			0
" @entity2 came out for the @entity6 supremacist mosque at the hallowed ground of 911 attack , " @entity154 , a leading foe of the @entity6 center , wrote on her blog friday night			2

" @entity163 , meanwhile , applauded the speech			0
" it was pitch perfect and it was cut and dry , " said @entity165 , executive director of the @entity166 and a @entity10 adviser to the @entity16 on faith issues			1
" he said that our @entity172 built a nation on religious freedom where people from different faiths can pray and thrive and that is that			0
" some @entity10 said they were surprised to hear the president weigh in on the controversy			1
" it 's such a hot potato and he 's already got so much on his plate and people jumping on him for any hint of an @entity6 connection , " said @entity180 , an @entity181 professor who attended friday 's @entity16 dinner			1
" but he plunged in and took a very bold position			0
" the @entity6 center 's leaders say they plan to build the $ 100 million , 13 - story facility called @entity193 three blocks from the site of the 9/11 attacks			0
the developer , @entity197 , describes the project as an " @entity199 " that will include a 500 - seat performing arts center , a lecture hall , a swimming pool , a gym , a culinary school , a restaurant and a prayer space for @entity10			2
