-- gaze across @entity1 this week , and you 'd be forgiven for thinking you had stepped back in time			1
each year , the @entity4 seaside town -- better known for its glamorous film festival and extravagant superyachts -- is transformed into a haven of historic nautical engineering			2
over 100 elegant wooden vessels , their white sails billowing like giant quills , will cruise the @entity12 in one of the biggest vintage yacht races in the world -- the @entity17 @entity16			1
forget throbbing engines and high - tech satellite gear			0
these multimillion dollar boats hark back to an era when sail ruled the waves , built from designs dating back centuries			1
" using vintage yachts is completely different to modern sailing - it 's not all about performance and technology , " said @entity26 , chief executive of sponsors @entity28 , who also spent three years and more than $ 3.8 million restoring a 1930s boat which will race this week			1
" each classic yacht expresses elegance , authenticity , craftsmanship , and above all , rarity and exclusivity			1
" he added : " everybody speaks the same language -- passion for the sea and a love for the great ladies of the sea			2
" for the love of sail if @entity26 's words seems dramatic , then perhaps it 's a reflection of competitors ' devotion -- and huge financial investment -- in these vintage vessels			1
with classic yachts costing up to $ 13 million , and often built using traditional techniques , it 's rare to see just one on the high seas -- let alone a fleet			1
" there are 100 of these boats at @entity1 , and there are not much more than 300 of them in the world , " said @entity63 , organizer at the @entity64 which helps run the regatta			1
" you can find a modern yacht anywhere			2
but for the crews taking part , these boats are really attractive because they 're so unique			1
" hailing from every corner of the globe , many of the classic yachts have a rich history , with the oldest built in 1896 by renowned @entity81 designer @entity80			1
also setting sail will be the 1930 @entity84 owned by legendary @entity87 tea magnate @entity85 , it was the fifth and final yacht he fielded in the @entity89 -- without success			1
race of a lifetime @entity1 is the final stop in the prestigious @entity94 , featuring 10 regattas held in the @entity12 and east coast of @entity97			0
the event is divided into three categories according to the age of the yachts -- those built before 1950 , those built before 1975 , and those built after 1975 but using classic designs			1
depending on weather conditions , the yachts will race various routes across @entity1 for around five hours			0
but for the 3,000 sailors taking part , maneuvering the old - fashioned vessels takes not just specialized knowledge -- but brute strength			1
" these boats are really heavy , " said @entity63			2
" when they 're launched they take a long time to stop and turn around			0
" " unlike modern yachts , they do n't have hydraulics , so sometimes it takes 10 guys pulling on the same rope			0
" royal beginnings the roaring twenties were a golden era for the @entity126 , with the @entity127 of @entity129 society holidaying -- and sailing -- at the pretty seaside town of @entity1			2
in 1929 the first @entity132 was born , in honor of @entity134 , @entity135			0
@entity136 put a temporary halt to the event , until it was re-launched in 1978			0
fast forward 35 years and the prestigious regatta now attracts 40,000 visitors each year			0
however , this year will also be an emotional event , with the death of @entity64 president @entity143 earlier this month			1
@entity63 paid tribute to @entity143 ' sense of humor and huge enthusiasm for the race			2
it is that same enthusiasm which sees thousands of crew members taking part , despite there being no prize money			2
rather than staying in ritzy hotels , many sleep on board the yachts			0
" a lot of different people are involved			0
the boat owners obviously have a high level of income			0
but the crews are often younger people with the strength to pull the ropes , " said @entity63			0
" it 's not about prize money			0
people do it for the spirit of the race			0
