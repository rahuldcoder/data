-- former president @entity1 said he sees parallels in the mood of the country now and on april 19 , 1995 , when the bombing of a federal building in @entity7 killed 168 people while he was in the @entity9			1
" there 's the same kind of economic and social upheaval now , " he told @entity0 's @entity10 in an interview to air friday on " @entity13			1
" " then , you had the rise of extremist voices on talk radio			0
here , you have a billion internet sites , " @entity1 said			1
and although the hard - core , anti-government radicals are still a minority , " they can communicate with each other much faster and much better than they did before			1
the main thing that bothered us since the time of @entity7 was that already , there was enough use of the internet that if you knew how to find a web site -- and not everybody even had a computer back then , but if you knew how to find it , you could learn , for example , how to make a bomb			1
" " now , everybody has got a computer ; web sites are easily accessible			0
and you can be highly selective and spend all of your time with people that are , you know , kind of out there with you , " he continued			0
@entity1 said the @entity7 bombing -- then the worst terrorist attack in @entity51 history -- was the " last in a series of very high - profile violent encounters " during the 1990s between anti-government activists and authorities			1
he said the country is better protected to prevent such an attack now			2
but when asked whether the anti-government mood now is more intense than in the 1990s , @entity1 said , " now , there are all of these groups , you know , saying things like the current political debate is just a prelude to civil war , all of that kind of stuff			1
" in an interview with the @entity71 on friday , @entity1 warned of the affect that angry political rhetoric might have on antigovernment radicals like @entity7 bomber @entity74 ; he pointed to rep. @entity75 calling the @entity77 administration and the @entity78 " the gangster government " at a tax day @entity81 rally on thursday			1
" they are not gangsters , " @entity1 told the newspaper			1
they are not doing anything they were not elected to do			0
" @entity1 said that demonizing the government with incendiary language can have effects beyond just rallying a crowd			1
" there can be real consequences when what you say animates people who do things you would never do , " @entity1 told the newspaper , pointing out that @entity74 and his conspirators " were profoundly alienated , disconnected people who bought into this militant antigovernment line			1
" but @entity1 said he did n't want to draw too tight of an analogy between then and now			1
he added that it 's not his intent to stifle criticism of government			0
" i 'm not interested in gagging anybody			0
i actually love this political debate , " @entity1 said			2
" most of the @entity81 people , though , are explicitly political			0
you 've got to give that now , " he said			0
" forget about whether we disagree with them or not			0
it 's really important to be able to criticize your government and criticize elected officials			0
that does n't bother me			2
" most of them have been well within bounds , " @entity1 said			2
" and they 're harsh but limited criticism ; in other words , they 're not advocating violence or encouraging other people to do it			0
" but i just think that we have to be careful , " the former president added			2
" we 've been down this road on more than one occasion before			2
we do n't want to go down it again			0

we do n't want to go down violent road again , he says
