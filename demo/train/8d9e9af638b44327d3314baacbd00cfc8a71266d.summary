@entity3 the former @entity0 who says he shot and killed @entity2 had just returned from his 11th deployment when he was called back for the 2011 raid on the @entity10 's most wanted terrorist 's @entity8 compound			1
but @entity11 and his @entity13 teammates did n't know they were preparing for a raid in @entity8			1
and they did n't know @entity2 was the target			0
" they sat us in a room and they said , ' hey we found a thing			0
and the thing 's in a house and the house is in a bowl and the bowl is in a country and you 're going to go to that house and you 're going to get that thing and you 're going to bring it back to us			0
' and that was it , " @entity11 recounted in a @entity33 interview that aired tuesday night			2
@entity11 has faced heat from other @entity0 who have either discredited his claims or said that it 's impossible for @entity11 to know that it was his bullets that struck and killed @entity2			1
without directly addressing @entity11 and his claims , the military brass wrote a timely letter criticizing seals who take public credit for their actions			2
" we do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain , " commanding officer @entity55 and force master sergeant @entity56 said in an october 31 letter to the @entity48 ranks			0
@entity11 said he and his colleagues , all senior seals , initially assumed the target was @entity60 dictator @entity59 as the timing coincided with the @entity63 intervention in the @entity65 country			2
but as planners began sharing the names of certain people linked to the raid , it clicked for @entity11 and his fellow @entity0			1
we 're going to get him , " @entity11 recalled			0
@entity11 initially was n't slated to be part of the team that would raid the compound itself			1
he was supposed to be the leader of a small team responsible for security outside the compound			0
but the lead @entity82 analyst -- who was portrayed by @entity83 in the film " @entity85 " -- told @entity11 , " if you want to kill him			0
he 's on the third floor			0
" " so i actually talked myself out of a team leader spot so i could stay on the helicopter and then go to the roof , " @entity11 said , becoming part of the unit the @entity0 referred to as the " martyr 's brigade			1
" " the more we trained on it the more we realized this is gon na be a one - way mission			1
we 're gon na go and we 're not gon na come back			1
we 're gon na die when the house blows up , we 're going to die when he blows up or we 're gon na be there too long and we 're gon na get arrested by the @entity8 and we 're going to spend the rest of our short lives in @entity8 prison , " @entity11 said			1
but @entity11 brushed off the criticism in an audio interview that aired friday on @entity4 's " @entity108 " " even now , i mean , there are guys now saying that i am full of s --- , " he said			2
" you only know what you were told unless you were in the room			0
and unfortunately for me , there was two people in the room , and one of us is dead and that 's @entity2			0

the former @entity0 has dismissed criticism surrounding his *decision* to go public
@entity11 initially was n't slated to be part of team that would raid compound
" the more we trained on it the more we realized this is gon na be a one - way mission , " he said
