@entity0 generally gets a bad rap when it comes to infectious diseases			1
grabbing headlines during recent bird - and swine - flu outbreaks , its proximity to @entity5 as well as its unenviable status as the worst - affected city during the 2003 @entity9 outbreak , @entity0 has been central to several global pandemic fears in recent years			1
it has n't even escaped fictional outbreaks -- the 2011 movie " contagion " had patient zero @entity18 bring back an unwelcome souvenir from a business trip to the city			2
but this bad biological baggage may come in handy			2
the unwelcome distinction of being home to over one fifth of the world 's @entity9 cases , and two fifths of the 774 fatalities from @entity9 meant @entity0 quickly developed and implemented a very sophisticated disease control and epidemiology infrastructure			1
at its most visible , any visitor arriving in @entity0 must pass through heat sensor monitors checking for high temperatures			1
this knowhow very probably limited the spread of both @entity38 and avian influenza			2
the lessons learned from @entity9 , and other outbreaks , has real application helping epidemiologists fight the spread of infectious diseases worldwide			2
and now the lessons learned from @entity9 are being put to the test			2
@entity49 threat the @entity49 respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( @entity51 ) was first reported to cause human infection in september 2012 , and since then has caused over 100 fatalities			1
despite the death toll , it is not yet a global concern on the scale of @entity9 , says @entity58 , director of the @entity59 ( @entity59 )			0
" even though our understanding of @entity51 is only a slowly evolving one , we can see important differences between it and @entity9 , " he told @entity60 via email			1
" perhaps the most important one is that @entity51 is spreading much slower than @entity9 -- we have not yet seen sustained human to human transmission			1
" a similarity with @entity9 is that both @entity9 and @entity51 are zoonotic ( when the virus can jump from animal to human ) viruses			1
@entity51 appears to be a zoonotic virus resulting from multiple introductions and re-introductions into the ( human ) community			1
" single - hump dromedary camels have been identified as the animal from which the zoonisis occurred			0
other species may also be carriers			0
upswing in case numbers it is important to draw a distinction between @entity9 and this newer respiratory disease , not least in terms of efficacy and human - to - human transmission			0
but a recent , alarming spike , has seen dozens of new @entity51 cases -- and several deaths reported this week alone -- which could indicate a change in the virus ' behavior			1
the @entity59 reported that its april figures -- 217 cases -- were greater than the past two years combined			1
" a lot of times these viruses will start in a certain part of the world ( like @entity9 in @entity104 ) , " @entity60 's @entity98 explains			0
" they do n't know exactly how it 's getting from camels to humans and while they 've found the virus in camels there could be other animals as well , as part of this whole mix. " it could be camel meat , it could be drinking unpasteurized camel milk -- both those things are common in @entity118			2
it could be some fluids from the camel			0
" researchers have shown @entity51 can transmit from human to human as well , but it is " very difficult for that to happen , " adds @entity98			1
while the vast majority of the cases have been confined to the @entity127 , there are recorded deaths attributable to @entity51 in @entity129 and the @entity130			1
two cases have been reported in @entity132			1
all reported cases originated in the @entity49			1
given the connectedness of the modern world , human - to - human transmission means the spread of the virus could potentially be geographically unlimited			2
an infected person traveling overseas is a " real concern , " says @entity98			0
" there is an incubation period ; you could be exposed , you could have the virus			2
you 're not yet sick and you get on a plane			0
that could happen , and in fact it has already happened			0
" lessons learned it is the protocols honed in @entity0 and around the world following @entity9 that offer the best way of limiting the spread of coronaviruses			1
knowledge is seen as key , with public education -- from hygiene such as hand - washing to preventative measures such as mask - wearing -- key to arresting the spread of coronaviruses			0
@entity118 is learning transparency is of key importance , recently replacing @entity165 , its secretive health minister , with @entity166 , a proponent of public education and openness			0
professor @entity169 , director of @entity171 's @entity170 , says @entity9 not only took everyone by surprise , it marked the re-emergence of infectious diseases as a major concern			0
he says in the wake of @entity9 , not only were resources -- like isolation wards in hospitals -- reallocated to combat infectious diseases like @entity9 , but as a result @entity0 has now become a center for infectious disease epidemiology and virology			1
" there was also @entity187 ( bird flu ) which happened on our doorstep and this expertise was heavily utilized , " he says			2
" the @entity171 group have contributed very significantly to that event and to understanding what 's going on there			0
we have been working on @entity51 since almost the time it emerged			1
we have a greater awareness of the emergence of coronoaviruses -- not only in @entity0 but internationally			2
" publicly , education about hygiene and disease containment in @entity104 and around the world are also much better following @entity9			0
" the consciousness of hygiene , issues of coughing and sneezing in public , the use of hand wipes and alcohol wipes ... and people wearing masks when they have respiration infection -- importantly , that is not to protect themselves but to protect others ( from infection ) , " says @entity169			0
" these are direct results of @entity9			0
" developing a cure ? @entity0 and @entity222 expertise is not limited to epidemiology and disease control , but also in developing a cure			1
a team of researchers from @entity0 and the mainland have developed two antibodies , which they say are " promising candidates " to develop a treatment for the syndrome			1
as reported in the @entity235 , the research into antibodies developed at the time of @entity9 has been invaluable in this case , and models of virus behavior developed during the 2003 outbreak have added to the urgency to develop an antidote for @entity51 before it becomes even more communicable			1
" the @entity51 coronavirus may undergo further genetic changes and one day become as transmissible as the sars coronavirus , " professor @entity243 , a @entity0 - based member of the research team and an expert in infectious diseases at the @entity171 told the newspaper			1
" therefore we must prepare for this scenario before it happens			0
" @entity254 : advice on prevention of the spread infectious coronaviruses -- cover your mouth when coughing or sneezing , and dispose of used tissues in a covered bin			0
-- wash hands frequently using soap and water , or use alcohol - based hand sanitizer			0
-- seek medical advice if you exhibit symptoms such as low grade fever , sore throat or running nose , or diarrhea			0
-- if exhibiting symptoms , wear a surgical mask to limit the spread of the virus			2
-- avoid contact with livestock , uncooked meat , unwashed fruits and vegetables , or unpasteurized milk			0
-- travelers who develop symptoms up to 14 days after their return from affected areas should put on surgical masks , seek medical attention and inform their doctor of their travel history .			0

expertise gained in @entity0 during sars epidemic helpful in battling @entity51 virus
over 100 @entity51 deaths have now been reported as cases spike
