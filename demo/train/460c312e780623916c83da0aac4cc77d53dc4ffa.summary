@entity1 , @entity0 -- airline pilots and cabin crew across @entity5 are holding demonstrations monday to protest over rules governing their flying hours which they say are putting the lives of passengers at risk			1
@entity5 pilots and cabin crew are calling for shorter flying times to protect passenger safety			1
organized by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , and the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , protesters are demanding that @entity21 rules on flying times are brought into line with scientific evidence			1
the @entity25 -- mandated by the @entity21 in september 2008 -- recommends that an airline crew should not operate for more than 13 hours during the day and 10 hours at night			1
current @entity21 rules stipulate pilots work up to a maximum of 14 hours during the day and nearly 12 hours at night			1
are you concerned at the hours worked by airline pilots ? tell us			1
speaking from one of the protests outside the @entity35 in @entity36 , captain @entity37 , president of the @entity16 told @entity2 : " at the moment , the @entity21 level is not adequate			1
that 's not our view that is the view of experts employed to review the @entity21 's own level of protection			2
" @entity37 said that despite being in possession of the report , the @entity21 completely ignored the recommendations when they produced new fatigue proposals in january 2009			2
the @entity16 and the @entity19 have printed over 100,000 dummy airline tickets which they will hand out to airline passengers			1
the tickets contain cigarette - style warnings giving details on crew fatigue and an explanation as to why the @entity21 current legislation needs to be changed			1
" all we are trying to do at this stage is raise public 's awareness			0
we 're not trying to get in anyone 's way , " @entity37 said			0
hundreds of protesters are attending events taking place at 22 airports across @entity5			1
400 @entity16 members are expected to attend the protests at @entity69			0
" what we are saying today is that they need to listen to the safety review , " @entity37 said			2
" it was conducted by the best scientists in this field in @entity5			2
it was commissioned by the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) and therefore it should not be ignored when writing the rules			0
" @entity79 , political secretary of the etf echoed @entity37 's concerns			0
" flight safety is the core mission of every cabin crew member			0
but @entity21 law is insufficient to ensure that air crew can perform their safety role in an alert and effective way , " he said			1
but the @entity77 were critical of the protests and their timing			0
" this is jumping the gun			0
it is not a constructive contribution to a debate which is yet to happen , " @entity94 , @entity77 communications director told @entity2			0
@entity94 believes that the pilots are simply setting up stall for an industrial debate between the unions and the airlines			0
" it 's got nothing to do with safety regulations			0
we have made it clear that we will invite the unions and the airlines to take part in a review of the current rules and the timeframe for that has been made clear			0
" the current law in @entity5 on air crew fatigue is set at two different levels			2
there is a minimum level set by @entity21 and then there is a level set by individual countries that can be better than that minimum level			2
in 2012 the @entity21 level is due to come into force			2
" there needs to be a change in the law to protect passengers and our members from the insidious effects of airport fatigue , " @entity37 said			0
the @entity16 represents over 38,000 pilots and flight engineers in 36 @entity5 countries .			1
