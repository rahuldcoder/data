-- besides its tall skyscrapers , nothing screams " @entity4 " more than bright neon lights			2
while neon signs are not unique to @entity4 , at one point they proliferated in tens of thousands of storefronts throughout the city			1
and just like @entity11 , which they are often associated with , neon signs became an iconic part of the city 's landscape by the middle of the twentieth century			1
but a changing landscape is unfolding and an increasing number of neon signs are disappearing			2
six years ago , architectural conservator @entity20 started documenting @entity4 's historic neon signs			1
" old neon signs had caught my attention for many years , but around this time they began to disappear at such a rate that i felt a real sense of urgency to photograph them before they vanished forever , " @entity20 said			2
the result is the book " @entity35 , " a visual tour of the remaining exposed - tube neon signs in the five boroughs of @entity4			1
most of the 200 signs featured in the book are early - and mid- 20th century examples , manufactured before 1970			0
@entity0 asked @entity20 to tell us more about the project recently via e-mail			0
following is an edited version of that interview : what is it about the history or medium of neon lights in @entity4 that intrigues you ? it 's many things			2
@entity4 's old neon signs stand out for their design , their great midcentury letterforms , and their materials			1
but even more than this , the signs almost invariably mark the spots of great old businesses -- bars , restaurants , small stores -- that give @entity4 's neighborhoods a " sense of place " -- a unique identity of their own			1
is there a time that one could consider the height of neon signs in @entity4 ? how many neon signs were there ? many neon sign aficionados would tell you that @entity4 's best neon signs went up in the 1930s , and i agree			1
sign designers really created some beautiful and unique works in the years before @entity81 , storefront signs in @entity4 tended to become less inventive , while signs for @entity84 - type motels and drive - ins became more flamboyant			0
this happened partly because of rising labor costs in @entity4 , and partly because of a general shift in emphasis from old urban centers to roadside and suburban development during this period			0
why were neon signs so popular ? one of the fascinating things about neon is how it has been popular -- and unpopular -- with different groups for different reasons through the years			2
from the 1920s through the ' 50s , neon was intensely popular with business owners for its ability to grab the attention of potential customers			0
while this is still true , many small business owners have opted for less expensive forms of outdoor advertising since the 1960s			0
today , old neon signs are popular with many @entity4 for their ability to evoke another era and most of all for their association with stalwart old independent neighborhood businesses			1
why are they disappearing ? very sadly , old neon signs in @entity4 are disappearing because many of the veteran businesses they advertise have had a hard time keeping up with the way the city has reinvented itself in the past 20 years			1
old businesses ca n't last forever , some close up when their owners pass away or retire			0
but many cite skyrocketing rents and real estate values for having ushered the demise of old restaurants , bars , hardware stores and other businesses that had been neighborhood institutions for generations			0
places like these give neighborhoods an identity and their disappearance has been the cause of much concern for many			0
when they go , they take their signs with them .			0

new book offers a visual tour of @entity4 's historic neon signs
many of the old signs are disappearing as businesses close
the remaining signs evoke another era and stand for independent business
