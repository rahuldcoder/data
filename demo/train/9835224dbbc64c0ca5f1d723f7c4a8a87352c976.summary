@entity1 , @entity0 -- in @entity4 , the tech - geek festival that begins here friday , some see a five - day spring break of sorts : a chance to discover some buzzy new apps , catch a few panels and party alongside web celebrities , futurists and many , many bloggers			1
but others see the festival as a microcosm of the larger tech - culture community , a place to preview things that may become mainstream in a few years and where trends that play out in downtown @entity1 are indicators of what 's to come			1
which is why we wonder each year : has the festival peaked ? will the irrationally app - exuberant bubble finally burst ? if @entity31 does n't keep growing at up to 40 % every year , does that mean the tech industry is slowing down or that the festival itself has reached capacity ? or is it only the hype that has plateaued ? this year , some @entity31 veterans feel the maturing festival , which began in the late 1990s , may have reached a saturation point , especially when it comes to startups trying to draw attention to new products			1
@entity31 famously helped @entity45 get off the ground in 2007 and gave apps such as @entity48 and highlight a boost in recent years			1
but as @entity31 has gotten crowded , it 's become much harder to stand out			1
" i feel like people are having to put more effort because there 's so much noise and so much going on , " said @entity50 , an entrepreneur who runs @entity51 , which will auto - rsvp attendees to unofficial parties and events for a fee			1
this year , @entity50 said , " there 's really no big app expected to launch , nothing huge people are excited for on the tech side			2
" that thought was echoed by a recent @entity68 article wondering whether the era of big @entity31 app launches may have passed			1
just days before the festival starts , there have also been no big blow - out events announced to rival 2012 's @entity75 concert featuring @entity76 , @entity78 's powerhouse gig or the party for the app @entity81 that drew investors @entity82 and @entity84 to town			1
@entity75 will still be at the festival , but it will likely keep a lower profile given it announced 5,400 job cuts in january			2
@entity89 is no longer a sponsor at interactive this year , and the annual @entity91 event will be missing			0
that being said , rumors that @entity94 will perform continue to swirl and notables such as former vice president @entity96 , entrepreneur @entity97 , broadcaster @entity98 and @entity100 star @entity99 are part of the official programming			0
and this year 's themes of private space travel , 3 - d printing , hacker culture and crowdfunding , still feel forward - looking			1
@entity108 , the longtime director of @entity31 , says a slowing of growth may actually benefit the festival , which in recent years has put a strain on @entity1 's infrastructure			1
@entity108 says that based on registration so far , the interactive part of the festival is expected to grow at a more modest rate of 5 % to 8 % this year			2
" it 's definitely not the sharper increases we 've had in the last few years , " @entity108 said			0
" in many ways , that 's a good thing			0
it gives us the bandwidth to work out some of the rough edges			0
" some of the growing pains , especially in the festival 's @entity127 ( a kind of " @entity132 " competition for startups ) , prompted the festival to expand its reach beyond @entity1			0
in august , it will launch @entity136 in @entity137 , a new @entity31 conference focused on tech entrepreneurship			2
it 's one way @entity31 is hoping to alleviate the hotel crunch and downtown congestion that happens here every march			2
@entity143 , a senior manager and social strategist with @entity145 , will be attending @entity31 for her third year			1
last year , she hosted videos for @entity147 , which was pushing its volt vehicles to techies at the fest. @entity143 believes things have been quieter going into interactive this year , at least from her perspective			0
" i keep asking myself , ' what do i feel is missing ? ' i do n't know if it 's me being snooty			0
" for 2013 , she says her schedule has shifted from big parties to smaller gatherings and networking , a trend she 's seeing among friends , some of whom are n't bothering to pay for a badge			0
" i think the size and how big it 's gotten were just so overblown that maybe people who have to be there now want to do things on their own			0
one person told me , ' i would rather grab a bottle of wine and head up to a rooftop with a small group of friends ' than go to the big parties , " @entity143 said			0
" a lot of people i know who are big company sponsors say they 're not even going to any of the sessions			0
i think the purpose of @entity31 has changed			2
" @entity50 , who 's been going to @entity179 for eight years and became more interested in @entity31 as she launched her company , says that people who use her service are less interested in hype and big stars than they are in free food , real networking and companies that have something unique to show			1
" spending a lot of money is n't as big a deal as it was two or three years ago , " she said			2
" now it 's about what you can offer people			0
