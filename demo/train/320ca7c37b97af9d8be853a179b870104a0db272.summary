@entity0 , @entity1 -- in between sipping drinks and reminiscing about bygone times at a recent reunion of my high school class , old friends curious about foreign news media 's coverage on @entity1 asked what stories i was working on			1
when i mentioned the 25th anniversary of the @entity14 crackdown -- which killed hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people -- as a major topic of interest in the coming days , the reaction was almost always surprise followed by indifference			1
" really ? who still cares about that ? " most of my former classmates who graduated from an elite @entity0 high school in 1994 are established both professionally and personally			1
now in their late 30s , they are doctors , bankers , engineers and businessmen living comfortably and raising their young children in @entity1 's largest city			1
timeline : the @entity14 crackdown when nudged , some classmates recalled the excitement we all felt as fresh - faced 8th graders witnessing history unfolding in front of our eyes back in 1989			1
mass demonstrations started in @entity41 in april that year as university students gathered in @entity14 to mourn the death of an ousted liberal @entity45 leader			1
by mid-may , the movement had become a nationwide phenomenon as people -- students , workers and intellectuals , united by their grievances against inflation and corruption -- took to the streets to demand political reform			0
our high school sits on a busy commercial street linking the city center and a university district in @entity0			1
almost every day that late spring , from our third - floor classroom , we could hear the chanting and cheering as demonstrators marched past our campus			0
' @entity64 ' we would rush downstairs or to the windows during breaks to watch the demonstrations			0
a sea of red flags and banners was a memorable scene of people power for those of us born after chairman @entity75 's @entity74			2
it was also thrilling to hear shouts of " democracy " and " freedom " reverberating in the air , as those words had largely been taught as phony @entity83 concepts in political science classes			0
in the end our political science teacher turned out to be right after all			0
every time when she sensed our diverted attention , she would remind us to focus on our textbook instead of the protests outside : " this will be over shortly and nothing good will come of it			2
" a few weeks later on june 4 , soldiers in @entity41 opened fire on civilians to clear @entity14 of protesters			1
several days after that , @entity0 authorities removed roadblocks set up by local demonstrators to disrupt traffic in protest at the brutal military suppression in the capital			1
when the dust settled and a new @entity45 leadership was installed in @entity41 , the same political science teacher returned to give us the party 's version of the events			2
" counter-revolutionary riot , " was the official verdict on the pro-democracy movement she wrote on the blackboard , emphasizing that the lesson was mandatory and a test would be given			0
tank man we were required to watch a video produced by state broadcaster cctv , which contained the iconic image of the " tank man " -- an unknown protester standing in front of a column of tanks to stop their advancement			0
gallery : behind the ' tank man ' image " he was like a mantis trying to obstruct a chariot			0
" i still remember this @entity1 idiom used by the announcer			2
" if not for the restraint of our military , he would have been obliterated			0
" along with political indoctrination , other aspects of life seemed to have returned to normal rather quickly -- at least in the eyes of teenagers			0
by the time i left @entity1 for the @entity148 in 1993 , the @entity14 protests had become a distant memory in my mind thanks to the government 's strenuous effort to erase the events from national consciousness shortly after the bloody crackdown			1
while i later found out more about what happened in 1989 and to those involved in the movement by reading eyewitness accounts , foreign news reports and academic papers , most of my former classmates staying behind in @entity1 did not enjoy such access			1
what they -- and the generations after them -- have enjoyed are the fruits of @entity1 's breakneck economic development that started in the early 1990s			1
" the @entity45 was forced to strike a deal with the @entity1 people in 1992 , " said @entity170 , a student leader of the pro-democracy movement who fled @entity1 after the military suppression and has lived in exile ever since			1
" @entity177 gave them the right to make money in exchange for political cooperation -- the deal worked			0
" the @entity184 - based activist , who remains the second most wanted man in @entity1 for his role in the @entity14 protests , says he is not surprised by the @entity1 leadership 's continued refusal to re-assess the movement , even though its official description has been watered down to " political disturbance between the spring and summer of 1989			1
" " the new ruling elite post- 1989 has been a mixture of princelings and technocrats , " he said , referring to descendants of @entity75 's peers and officials with a technical background			1
" they have formed an alliance to write laws that benefit them and protect their entrenched interests above anything else -- so they have little tolerance to any challenge to the status quo			0
" annual crackdown every year around june 4 , the @entity1 government rounds up political dissidents , human rights advocates and families of the crackdown victims to prevent them from gathering or speaking to mark the occasion			1
under the leadership of president @entity220 , himself a princeling , the authorities struck earlier and harder this year , detaining activists -- including prominent lawyer @entity222 -- for attending on low - key seminar on the @entity14 protests			2
veteran journalist @entity225 , another well - known voice on the topic , was taken into custody for allegedly leaking state secrets even before the meeting			0
leading human rights activist @entity231 , who is organizing an online campaign to commemorate the 1989 movement , has been under house arrest since late february			2
@entity14 , a major tourist attraction , remains off limits to foreign news outlets , especially around june 4			2
soldiers , police and state security agents flood the square during the anniversary period , ready to halt even the slightest sign of on - site reporting			2
with references to the protests long banned in textbooks and print media , the authorities are now busy blocking @entity251 services and scrubbing allusions to the taboo subject in cyberspace , ordering social media to block keywords as subtle as " this day , " " 25 years " and " between spring and summer			0
" the ever - stricter censorship may have caused many young @entity1 -- people in their 20s and early 30s -- to appear oblivious of the 1989 movement as my colleagues discovered on the streets of @entity41			1
" i 'm not worried about this thanks to the @entity264 , " @entity170 said			0
" even the small percentage of people who do know is too big for the government to cover it up			0
" " people will eventually understand that many issues today stem from social problems that were n't resolved in 1989 , " said @entity231 , the activist under house arrest			0
" in a tyranny , they are deprived of a series of rights -- land grabs , forced home demolitions , educational inequality and environmental pollution are all along the same line			0
" measured progress for the most part , though , many young professionals and entrepreneurs -- while complaining about a widening income gap and rampant official corruption amid a slowing economy -- have told me that they believe in measured progress instead of revolutions for a vast country like @entity1			2
" you can call them pragmatic and materialistic , but they are also individualistic -- and individualism has been the perfect incubation for the idea of equality and freedom , " @entity170 offered			0
" it has happened in the @entity301 -- and the younger generations in @entity1 will have their glory tune			2
" but it 's unlikely to be " nothing to my name , " a rock song by @entity1 superstar @entity308 about the dispossessed youth that became the unofficial anthem for @entity14 protesters a quarter century ago .			1

@entity2 's @entity314 recalls his time as a student in @entity0 during the @entity14 crackdown
@entity314 says his @entity1 friends express surprise , indifference as @entity2 marks 25th anniversary
@entity1 government has made strenuous efforts to erase the period from national consciousness
officials continue to suppress all mention of events in 1989 by censorship of media , internet
