-- it 's as predictable as the sun rising and setting			2
even though police made more than 850,000 marijuana arrests last year , a recent government report shows youth marijuana use increased by about 9 percent			1
supporters of the failed war on drugs will no doubt argue this increase means policymakers should spend more taxpayer money next year arresting and incarcerating a greater number of @entity15			1
in other words , their solution to failure is to do more of the same			2
fortunately , the " reform nothing " club is getting mighty lonely these days -- 76 percent of @entity15 recognize the drug war has failed ; millions are demanding change			2
in the almost 40 years since president @entity23 declared a war on drugs , tens of millions of @entity15 have been arrested and hundreds of billions of dollars have been spent			1
yet drugs are just as available now as they were then			2
it is hard to find even an elected official who has n't used marijuana or other illegal drugs			1
former president @entity33 made taped comments that many interpreted as indicating he did too			2
then there 's @entity37 , who famously said he smoked pot but did n't inhale			2
@entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 admit they used drugs			2
drug use is so widespread the @entity45 changed its policy of not hiring people with a history of illegal drug use because the policy disqualified so many people that it could not fill its law enforcement positions			2
the war on drugs has n't just failed ; it 's created problems of it own			0
laws restricting the availability of sterile syringes have increased the spread of @entity61 and @entity62 aggressive campaigns to arrest and incarcerate drug users have increased drug - related deaths by making drug users too afraid to call 911 when a friend is overdosing			0
the government 's misleading and over-the - top anti-drug messages have made young people mistrust other anti-drug messages from parents and adults			0
mass incarceration of drug offenders has drained state and federal resources , distracted police from dealing with violent crime , and produced a generation of children with one or both parents behind bars instead of at home			1
the racial disparities are appalling			0
as @entity86 so eloquently shows in her new book , " @entity87 , " a drug conviction automatically makes a person a second - class citizen who can be legally discriminated against in housing and employment , denied school loans , and barred for life from serving on juries , accessing public benefits and even voting			0
while @entity15 make up only about 13 percent of the @entity100 population and about 15 percent of drug users , they make up about 38 percent of those arrested for drug law violations and a mind - boggling 59 percent of those convicted for drug law violations			0
like @entity107 did for alcohol , drug prohibition is also enriching organized crime			1
instead of regulating marijuana to control who can access it , policymakers have ceded control of the $ 400 - billion - a - year global drug market to crime syndicates and thugs			1
in @entity119 , where parts of the country are like @entity122 under @entity123 on steroids , 28,000 people have died since president @entity125 launched a war three years ago against well - armed , well - funded drug trafficking organizations			0
the @entity100 government does n't report its prohibition - related deaths , but law enforcement officers , drug offenders and civilians die every day in our country 's war on drugs , too			1
it is long past time to abandon the silly notion that @entity100 can be a drug - free nation			0
the inconvenient truth in drug policy is that @entity15 love drugs -- alcohol , caffeine , marijuana , cocaine , and prescription drugs for everything from anxiety to fatigue			1
although some people develop problems with their drug use , most do not			0
this holds true for both legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco , and illegal drugs like marijuana and cocaine			1
decades of evidence shows that the average user of any drug does n't get addicted and does n't create problems for anyone else			0
we recognize these facts when it comes to legal drugs			0
it 's why we do n't arrest the tens of millions of @entity15 who drink responsibly , but do arrest people who drive while drunk or get belligerent and start fights			0
yet we waste tens of billions of dollars every year arresting @entity15 for marijuana or other drugs , even when they 're not harming anyone			1
then we either jam them into overcrowded jails where they take up space that could hold someone who committed a violent offense , or jam them into a treatment program where they take up limited spaces for people who really need help			1
what matters most is not how many people use marijuana , alcohol or other drugs , but what 's the best way to reduce the problems associated with substance misuse without creating more harmful social problems			1
drug use rates rise and fall almost independently of what politicians say and do , but criminalizing drug use makes the situation worse			0
@entity107 does n't stop drug use ; it makes drug use more dangerous while filling prisons with nonviolent offenders and making crime lords rich			1
with marijuana use among young people rising despite decades of punitive drug policies , policymakers should reform @entity100 drug policy			1
or maybe voters will reform it for them			0
in november , @entity214 voters will vote on @entity215 , which seeks to control marijuana like alcohol , redirect police resources toward violent criminals , and end @entity214 's embarrassingly racist marijuana enforcement once and for all			1
polling shows support is about 50 - 50			0
even if @entity215 loses , it will only be temporary			0
support for marijuana legalization is growing , and not just in @entity214			2
it 's just a question of how many lives and tax dollars will be wasted before it does			1
some vested interests , of course , will fight change until the bitter end			0
progress has never been accepted by everyone			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			1

@entity240 : despite all the arrests and money spent , youth marijuana use is increasing
piper : overdoses not reported ; criminals thrive , jails filled with nonviolent offenders
as we do with alcohol , he writes , *bad* *behavior* , not use , should be punished
marijuana will be legalized , but how many lives and money will be wasted first , @entity255 asks
