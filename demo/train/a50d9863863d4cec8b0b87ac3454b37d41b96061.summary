-- in just a few days , @entity1 has shown that as @entity1 he will be the kind of approachable , down - to - earth man that people yearn for in a spiritual leader			1
like the @entity6 and bishop @entity7 , he smiles easily and appears to walk comfortably through the world			0
he showed his humanity on his first full day in office as he suddenly left the @entity11 to visit @entity13 's main church , the @entity15 basilica , and then stopped by the hotel where he had stayed before the recent conclave to pay his bill			1
like any major political leaders who communicate with symbols and gestures , @entity20 hierarchs use style and stagecraft to reach their followers			0
the conclave and then the presentation of the new pope have been refined , as theater , over more than a thousand years			0
the secrecy surrounding the selection of the pontiff and the pomp accompanying the announcement from the balcony produce the kind of drama that rivets the world even in an age of technological distraction			0
who is n't awed by the sights and sounds of a hundred - thousand people gathered in @entity46 , awaiting and then greeting the man chosen to lead 1.2 billion people ? opinion : a humble , authentic and credible pope just as we are meant to be affected by religious stagecraft , we are also practically hardwired to seek the meaning in a leader 's every move			1
when @entity1 visited @entity15 he met briefly with cardinal @entity57 , who recently stepped down as archpriest of the basilica			1
a decade ago , when he was archbishop of @entity59 , @entity57 was a notorious figure in the scandal that arose around the sexual abuse of children by priests			1
as scores of victims accused him of failing to protect children from predatory priests , he became the only bishop to resign because of the abuse crisis ; he then fled to @entity13			0
but while many @entity59 @entity72 consider @entity57 a disgraced figure , his fellow bishops have continued to respect him and , in reaching out to him , @entity1 appeared to echo this solidarity			1
opinion : pope @entity1 is no herald of big changes this can be seen as a reminder to the world that the @entity72 remains under the control of men who were appointed to high office by the archconservatives @entity86 and @entity87 and share a commitment to the orthodoxies that have alienated so many modern @entity72			1
on the status of women , priestly celibacy , contraception and sexuality , @entity1 is as firmly rooted in the past as his predecessors			1
for example , during the debate that eventually resulted in gays in @entity99 being allowed to marry , then - archbishop @entity1 mounted a fierce campaign against this equality			1
he argued that @entity103 himself was the author of a reform he called " a machinization of the ' @entity106 ' , " and that children and families would be harmed by the change			0
while he was archbishop of @entity111 , @entity1 spoke often of the poor and called attention to the many ways that modern societies push people without status to the margins			1
in this way , he reflected @entity121 's affiliation with the outcasts of his time			0
however , even as he spoke for the powerless , @entity1 also consistently aligned himself with powerful conservative politicians seeking to oust the government headed first by @entity131 and later by his wife , the current president @entity124 , and which enjoyed wide support from the middle and lower classes			2
time and again he invoked @entity133 in his political campaigns and suggested the other side was somehow less holy			0
as he engaged in politics , @entity1 emphasized the special status claimed by the church as an agent of his @entity133 , which , he implied , makes it superior to all other institutions			1
when he became @entity1 , @entity1 expressed the same sentiment in his very first formal remarks , delivered at the @entity145			2
there he warned that without emphasizing its religious base the church runs the risk of becoming " a pitiful ngo " ( nongovernmental organization )			0
@entity152 : @entity1 pick a signal to @entity155 catholics for those who respect @entity157 such as @entity158 and the @entity159 , @entity1 ' choice of words -- " pitiful ngo " -- was a stinging reminder that this man with the humble style can not resist claiming superiority based on supernatural beliefs			2
this is the great contradiction of the new pope			0
on the one hand he criticizes hypocrisy in the church and shows his discomfort with the trappings of power			0
on the other , he shows disdain for social institutions and leaders that compete with the church for influence and authority			0
the dichotomy represented by the values espoused by @entity184 and an imperial church is what makes so many people uncomfortable with official @entity20			1
stylistically , the world is getting a far more approachable , @entity121 - like man who understands the compassion and empathy people crave from spiritual leaders			0
however , @entity1 ' record appears to indicate there will be no real changes where it matters -- on the status of women , power - sharing , sexual ethics -- and thus huge numbers of @entity72 will remain alienated			2
the biggest risk the @entity72 faces today is irrelevance , and while the new pope 's style means he 'll get a hearing , what he has to say about issues that matter the most is unlikely to make the institution any more relevant than it was before him			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214			2

@entity214 : in pope @entity1 ' first days it 's hard not to plumb meaning of his gestures
he says among them was a visit with disgraced @entity57 , *implicated* in sex abuse scandal
he says in this and other moves , he 's shown commitment to orthodoxy of church hierarchy
@entity214 : @entity1 embodies *tension* between *christian* values , imperial church
