@entity0 -- as searches for nearly 13,000 missing continued sunday , police in @entity3 said 8,199 people had died since the monster earthquake and ensuing tsunami struck last week			1
meanwhile , the march 11 tremors shifted the @entity11 near the epicenter by just over 17 feet and dropped it by just over 4 feet , the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity3 , reported saturday			2
those two land mass movements are records for @entity3 , according to government figures			2
the global positioning system data from the @entity18 - based authority revealed the peninsula on the @entity20 moved in an east - southeasterly direction toward the epicenter			2
the quake also moved land masses in many areas ranging from the northeastern region of @entity28 to the @entity27 including @entity0 , the authority said			2
@entity30 efforts have been hampered by snowfall in the hardest - hit areas , said spokesman @entity33 of the @entity34 and @entity34			1
" the cold is a real issue , particularly for the thousands of people in shelters , many of them elderly , " he said , describing providing medical care as a " massive challenge			1
" while efforts accelerated saturday to restore power to cooling systems at the crippled @entity46 nuclear power plant , the focus shifted toward rebuilding in some parts of the country hardest hit by the temblor and the devastating wall of water that followed			1
" we need to go forward , " @entity54 mayor @entity53 told construction workers , according to @entity56			2
crews began building hundreds of temporary , prefabricated housing units in the coastal city , the agency said			0
a widely reported rescue saturday offered a brief glimmer of hope amid headlines of death and destruction			1
but @entity3 authorities later changed their story , saying a man rescued from the rubble of his home saturday had actually been staying in a shelter			0
originally , the @entity3 @entity74 reported that the man had been trapped for eight days			0
meanwhile , the @entity76 said workers had laid extensive electrical cable near the @entity46 power plant 's no. 2 nuclear reactor -- a key step in an effort to restore power to the plant that authorities hope will keep temperatures low			1
that would curb the emission of radioactive material and , in a worst - case scenario , a full nuclear meltdown			0
@entity0 's fire department also began a new method of spraying water in and around the @entity46 power plant 's no. 3 reactor using an unmanned system that can spray sea water for up to seven hours at a time			1
in previous missions , firefighters , soldiers and power company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure			1
tests revealed abnormally high levels of radiation that violate @entity3 food safety laws in samples of spinach and milk from areas near the nuclear plant , chief cabinet secretary @entity106 told reporters saturday			1
authorities are mulling regulating movement of agricultural products from the area , as well as collecting more data for analysis , @entity106 said			0
on friday , authorities acknowledged that the situation at the troubled power plant was far more serious than they had originally estimated			1
@entity76 's managing director , @entity125 , broke down in tears after leaving a news conference in @entity46 at which exposure levels were discussed			1
in a written statement , company president @entity129 said , " we sincerely apologize ... for causing such a great concern and nuisance			0
" even as the country 's emergency agency raised its rating of the crisis at the @entity46 nuclear plant from a 4 to 5 -- putting it on par with the 1979 incident at @entity142 's @entity141 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity143 told his compatriots to bury their pessimism friday			1
" with a tsunami and earthquake we do n't have any room to be pessimistic , " he said			0
" we are going to create @entity3 again from scratch			0
we should face this challenge together			1
" @entity143 acknowledged the situation at the @entity46 plant remains " very grave " and said his government has disclosed all that it knows to both the @entity3 people and the international community			1
" the police , fire department and self defense forces are all working together , putting their lives on the line , in an attempt to resolve the situation , " he said			1
meanwhile , the government raised the radiation exposure level for workers trying to avert a further crisis , @entity3 public broadcaster @entity163 reported saturday			2
@entity76 said workers at the plant -- including company employees , members of the military and firefighters -- can now be exposed to 250 millisieverts of radiation before they must leave the area			1
an individual in a developed country is naturally exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year			2
the @entity179 recommends no more than 50 millisieverts exposure in a given year for nuclear rescue and recovery workers			0
it offers no restriction in a crisis when " the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer 's risk			0
" @entity76 has said it was doing all it can to protect workers ' health			0
@entity3 's nuclear agency said friday several hundred workers , including nonpower company employees , remained on site			0
in populated areas outside the nuclear facility , there have been few indications of any immediate , dangerous fall - out from the crisis so far			0
for the past eight days , weather patterns indicate that the wind has likely blown most emitted radiation out to sea			2
the @entity207 @entity206 will run its last bus from @entity209 to @entity0 on sunday			0
as of saturday , five of the embassy 's free buses had transported 61 @entity207 nationals , 15 dependents and 31 persons of other nationalities over that route , according to @entity207 's @entity218			0
" based on demand , we do not plan to run any more coaches after sunday , " the office said in a statement			0
@entity1 's @entity223 contributed to this report			0
