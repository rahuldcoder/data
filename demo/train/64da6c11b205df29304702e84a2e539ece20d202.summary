-- the @entity1 begins each session with a proclamation that ends with the words " @entity5 save this @entity6			1
" even strict advocates of the @entity8 ought to say " @entity13 " to that line after thursday 's decision upholding the constitutionality of the @entity12			1
i write this as someone who not only thought that the act would be overturned , but also still thinks there are strong constitutional arguments to be made against the mandate			0
all @entity25 , however , regardless of their partisan affiliation or views on the @entity24 , had something to celebrate thursday			1
despite what almost all the pundits predicted , the court 's decision provides some evidence that there remains one institution of @entity25 government that can not be seen as nakedly partisan			1
in the end , chief justice @entity36 , a career @entity38 who was nominated for the @entity1 by @entity40 , cast the deciding vote upholding the signature act of the current @entity45 administration			1
this , i think , is what @entity25 indicated they were looking for when they elected a president in 2008 who , four years earlier , had risen to national prominence by giving a speech in which he took issue with those who would " slice - and - dice our country into red states and blue states			1
" unfortunately , the divide between @entity38 and @entity45 has , if anything , gotten worse over the past 3Â½ years			2
of course , each side blames the other for this result ; they are both right			0
more blame , however , is not what is needed			2
we used to refer to @entity67 , or at least the @entity68 , as the " world 's greatest deliberative body			0
" we all know that very little of what might be termed " deliberation " goes on within either chamber nowadays			0
instead , @entity38 attack @entity45 , and @entity45 attack @entity38			2
to deliberate means to consider something carefully			0
it means you have to listen to and weigh the position of your opponent			0
unfortunately , in today 's world , partisans have adopted what amounts to a version of political fundamentalism in which giving any credence to the other side 's position is a form of heresy			1
but deliberate is exactly what the @entity1 does			2
it is a far from perfect process , and yes , the court is affected by politics			0
as @entity94 reminded us , however , neither the government nor the governed are angels			0
perfection is not to be expected			0
some attempt , however , to think through issues in a nonprejudicial way is required			0
of course , @entity1 justices have advantages			2
they do not have to stand for election and , as the chief justice wrote in his opinion read thursday , they do not have to take a position on whether a law " embodies sound policies			1
" nevertheless , the court , and particularly the chief justice , offered an important lesson to the political branches on thursday on how they might undertake to solve the nation 's problems			1
will those who serve in the political branches listen ? their initial reactions are certainly not encouraging			0
the president and @entity67 may , however , want to take a look at current approval polls			0
although even their numbers have declined lately , the @entity1 has a much higher net approval number ( +8 ) , than @entity127 ( -4 ) , or the @entity67 ( -62 )			1
hopefully , the court 's numbers will be improved after thursday 's decision			1
both the @entity38 and @entity45 will doubtless find fault with @entity36 ' opinion , but the example of bipartisan deliberation that the court provided was much needed in today 's political climate			1
" @entity139 " deserves our gratitude			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			2

@entity142 says whatever your political bent , you can celebrate @entity1 's decision
he says it 's evidence that there 's still an @entity25 institution that is not nakedly partisan
he says a career @entity38 , the chief justice , cast deciding vote on @entity127 's law
@entity142 : the example of bipartisan deliberation was much needed in today 's political climate
