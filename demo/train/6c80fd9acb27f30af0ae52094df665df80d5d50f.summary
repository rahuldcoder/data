fear is something that consumes all of us at one time or another			2
what matters is whether you let your fear control you or parts of your decision - making ? and if so , is fear something we can improve upon ? before i was selected to be a part of @entity13 , i was afraid of flying			1
let me rephrase that -- i was scared to death of flying			1
what could possibly go wrong ? many things ran through my head			2
another fear i had was swimming in large bodies of water			1
i knew how to swim ; i grew up with a pool at my house			2
i was very comfortable swimming in a pool because i could see the bottom			1
you ca n't see the bottom of the ocean when you swim in it			1
what could possibly go wrong ? a shark attack			2
i came to realize that i was missing out on things because of my fears			1
i would only vacation in places i could drive to			0
in fact , last october , my partner @entity43 and i drove 14 hours to @entity45 , @entity46 , for a long weekend			0
we could have gotten a sweet rate on round - trip airfare and had more time at the beach , but i elected to drive instead			0
i was beyond excited when i was selected for @entity13 in december			1
but fear quickly took over when i realized that not only did @entity13 involve swimming in the ocean but also two trips to @entity53 ( somewhere beyond even my driving desire )			1
yet i wanted to be part of @entity13 so badly that i knew i would have to meet both of these fears head on			1
in january , i was scheduled to fly to @entity58 for kick - off weekend			0
as the days got closer , i grew more anxious			0
people began to tell me stories about their first flying experience ; some had flown as children , unaccompanied , to visit family			1
another friend told me she traveled often for her job ; she flew more than 140 times last year			0
i began to wonder what could possibly go wrong			0
seeing another part of the country ? visiting people i had n't seen in years ? finishing a triathlon ? i came to realize that i was looking at the worst possible scenario instead of the best - case scenario			1
i decided that i had to take a chance			0
fortunately for me , my first flight was a short one			0
i kept telling myself that millions of people fly every day and nothing happens -- except that they get to their desired destinations and go about their business			0
i have now flown four different times , including cross-country twice			0
and i have found that i actually enjoy flying			1
during our midway training trip in @entity53 , we started our swim training in a lap pool			1
i could see the bottom ; i was in control ; no problem			0
then came our first training session in the ocean			1
i was nervous -- sweaty palms and all , as i listened to our instructions			0
but as my coach explained dolphin diving ( a technique used by swimmers to get under a wave ) i began to feel a sense of confidence			0
it was almost as if i knew what i had to do , and there was n't anything that was going to stop me			0
was my fear of the ocean , or of the unknown ? people who have swum less than me had completed this challenge ; what was holding me back ? one of the lifeguards set a buoy at 150 yards			1
my teammate and i swam out to it without any problems			0
i remember treading water , talking to him , thinking : " i just swam 150 yards out into the ocean			2
" over the next few days , i completed four different swims in the @entity125 , including a mock triathlon distance of 400 yards			2
can your fears go away ? i feel completely different about flying and swimming in the ocean than i did a year ago			1
i actually enjoy flying now and look forward to heading back to sunny @entity53 in september			1
although something can be said for long car trips with your family , i think back to the hours that could have been spent relaxing and enjoying vacation instead of being behind the wheel			2
i also look forward to swimming once again in the @entity125			2
i would n't say i 'm a risk - taker , but i think i am more willing to take a chance on things now			0
one of my favorite quotes i say to my athletes is , " if you do what you always do , you get what you always get			0
" do n't let your fears stand in your way of " getting " something more ! you have more to lose than pounds why i gave up soda			2
