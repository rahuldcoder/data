-- " @entity2 creator " @entity3 said sunday night 's @entity4 were a buzz - kill due to producers over-stuffing the ceremony with tributes to fallen celebrities			1
the telecast featured the usual " @entity12 " slideshow , plus five break - out tributes scattered throughout the evening honoring talents such as @entity15 , @entity16 and â € ” most controversially â € ” glee co-star @entity17			2
plus , there was a " power of television " segment touching on @entity21 's assassination			2
with all those black suits in the audience , one could have easily mistaken the @entity4 for a funeral			0
@entity3 first made a reference to the ceremony being the " saddest emmys of all time " while on stage to pick up his award for @entity2 winning best comedy series			1
later he told @entity0 the endless tributes dragged down the emotional flow of the show â € ” particularly for host @entity36			1
" listen , nobody is more respectful of those who have come and gone and made a mark in this business , but i believe the @entity4 should be a celebration about all that is exciting and wonderful about television , " @entity3 said			1
" all those people are very deserving , and other people are deserving too			0
i thought it was too sad			0
poor @entity36 , who was so brilliant , had to keep digging himself out of the holes dug by these sad moments , time and time again			2
