-- the @entity2 official was just talking about one area , but he summed up a winter storm that struck much of the eastern @entity5 on wednesday			1
" we dodged a bullet , " said @entity6 , a spokesman for the @entity7			1
as night fell , travelers and transportation authorities breathed a collective sigh of relief as the worst of holiday travel fears failed to materialize			1
the storm caused some complications and inconveniences , but no major delays or breakdowns			1
forecasters see mostly smooth sailing into @entity22			1
@entity0 meteorologist @entity23 predicted some lake - effect snowfall over the @entity26 and fresh snow from a weak disturbance for the @entity28			1
but , he added : " the worst in terms of widespread snow and rain is over			1
tomorrow will be a quieter day , although wind gusts will continue to be a problem overnight and thursday for the @entity35			1
" that 's good news for people like @entity39 , who joined the more than 43 million americans expected by @entity41 to travel over the @entity22 holiday weekend			1
@entity39 said wednesday that she arrived more than two hours early at @entity44 's @entity43 to catch a flight to @entity47 's @entity46			1
" i thought the lines were going to be ridiculous , " she said in an e-mail			1
" i was second in line checking my bag with @entity52 ( checked into my flight last night ) and security was a breeze			2
i walked right up , the @entity57 agent checked my info and i immediately started the security process			2
and now the wait begins			2
it 's pretty quiet by the gates			2
not too many people roaming around			2
so far , so good ! @entity22 ! ! ! ! " @entity64 said he , too , was expecting a horrible trip when he departed @entity47 for @entity66 to get a flight to @entity68			2

wish the forecasters were wrong all the time : ) " will winds whip parade balloons ? though the worst of the storm has passed , winds could still pose a problem			1
the forecast has left up in the air the fate of the balloons in @entity88			1

the impact was more pronounced at @entity169 , which tallied 56 cancellations because of the weather , he said			0
" the real story is people are getting to their destinations , albeit a little delayed in some but not all cases , " he said			0
