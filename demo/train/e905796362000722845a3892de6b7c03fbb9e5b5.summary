-- chances are , you were n't at the movies this weekend			1
not a single film at the box office reached $ 10 million			1
call it the curse of " the @entity8			2
" the top 12 films grossed a depressingly low $ 51.9 million — the worst top 12 total since sept. 5 - 7 , 2008 , when @entity11 flop @entity12 led the chart with $ 7.7 million and the @entity15 films earned $ 50.3 million			2
even more distressingly , this weekend marked the lowest cumulative ticket sales in over a decade			1
the last frame to notch worse overall ticket sales was sept. 21 - 23 , 2001 — two weekends after the 9/11 attacks — when only one new wide release entered theaters : @entity24 's infamous bomb @entity25			1
( keep in mind , as final weekend results come in on monday , things could change			1
) ahead of the @entity29 : weekly pop culture calendar @entity32 's $ 14 million horror entry @entity31 once again topped the chart with $ 9.5 million			1
the film , which earned a " b " @entity36 grade last week , enjoyed a better than expected hold ( it dropped 46 percent ) — especially since its debut results were inflated by it bowing on a holiday weekend			1
after ten days , @entity31 has earned $ 33.3 million , and by the end of its run , it may possess close to $ 50 million total			1
if you 're not a fan of demonic tales like @entity31 , prepare yourself to keep seeing them for a long while at the box office			1
the " @entity55 " conceit , which was effectively used in marketing for the possession ( and similar titles like @entity54 ) , still has n't worn out its welcome with @entity58 audiences , and horror tales are so cheap to make that they do n't need gargantuan grosses to provide solid financial returns for their studios			1
in second place , @entity65 's moonshine - drenched crime drama @entity66 dropped 40 percent and took in an additional $ 6 million in its second weekend			1
the period piece , which stars @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , has garnered $ 23.5 million after 12 days			0
@entity72 has yet to confirm a budget for the film			1
@entity76 ' the @entity75 , the generically titled writing drama that 's garnered attention for being the meeting place of the are - they - or - are n't - they ? couple @entity81 and @entity83 , started its run in third place with just $ 5 million from 2,801 theaters			1
even by @entity76 standards , that is very low			0
the fledgling studio , which began releasing films in 2010 , only has one real hit to its name : the woman in @entity94 , which grossed $ 54.3 million earlier this year			0
every other one of their releases — their repertoire includes titles like @entity101 ( $ 12.1 million total ) , @entity103 ( $ 27.9 million ) , and @entity104 ( $ 37.5 million ) — has been a relative misfire			0
but the @entity75 ' $ 5 million bow is the lowest ever for a wide release from the studio , as is its cold $ 1,767 per theater average			1
fortunately , the film was n't expensive			2
the drama was shot for $ 6 million , and after a run at @entity113 , @entity76 picked it up for $ 2 million			0
audiences , which were 58 percent female and 78 percent above the age of 25 , issued the title a " b " @entity36 grade			0
what airs when ? for @entity122 's @entity121 , who has found huge success in @entity125 films as well as last year 's thriller @entity127 , the @entity75 marks his second straight box office stinker following last month 's critically panned comedy @entity129 , which opened to just $ 4.7 million			1
unfortunately for @entity81 , one of his new movies that premiered at @entity133 , @entity134 , was n't exactly well received by @entity0 's @entity135			2
( on the other hand , his other film at the festival , director @entity137 's @entity136 , appears to be winning some considerable early praise			2
) two holdovers rounded out the @entity143			0
in fourth , @entity32 's @entity144 2 dipped 47 percent to $ 4.7 million , giving the action flick $ 75.4 million after four weekends			0
in fifth , @entity148 's @entity147 dropped 44 percent to $ 4 million , lifting the film 's total past the $ 100 million mark to $ 103.7 million			2
at this point , it 's clear that the $ 125 million sequel / reboot wo n't be able to match the total of the original @entity156 , which found $ 121 million in 2002			0
the possession -- $ 9.5 million 2			0
@entity66 -- $ 6.0 million 3			0
the words -- $ 5.0 million 4			0
the @entity144 2 -- $ 4.7 million 5			0
the @entity159 -- $ 4.0 million elsewhere on the chart summit 's new wide release @entity160 opened in 13th place with a truly dismal $ 1.8 million from 1,511 theaters			1
the $ 25 million film , which @entity161 co-financed with @entity165 , has been on the shelf for a while , but the studio had to dump it somewhere — and they chose a weekend when its failure would not likely draw much attention			1
audiences issued the thriller a " d + " cinemascore grade			0
here 's hoping the film 's star , @entity175 , fares better as @entity178 in 2013 ′ s @entity179			2
@entity160 finished just a bit ahead of @entity183 's one - week - only re-release @entity181 : the @entity184 , which whipped up $ 1.7 million from 267 @entity184 theaters — good for a $ 6,461 location average			1
in limited release , @entity72 's much buzzed - about comedy @entity188 , which stars @entity189 , @entity190 , and @entity191 as naughty party girls , fizzled with only $ 191,000 from 47 theaters — enough for a per theater average of $ 4,064			2
that figure does n't merit major expansions in the weeks to come			0
@entity188 's under - performance is somewhat surprising given its strong @entity200 performance in august			0
and finally , in milestone news , after a $ 3.3 million weekend , conservative documentary 2016 : @entity204 's @entity58 became the second highest grossing political documentary of all time			2
the film , which has taken in $ 26.1 million so far , still trails @entity208 ( $ 119.2 million ) by a huge margin , but it passed both @entity210 ( $ 24.1 million ) and @entity211 ( $ 24.5 million ) this weekend			1
its total is remarkable for a documentary			0
next week , @entity214 will put @entity215 : retribution into about 2,850 theaters , while @entity218 will re-release @entity219 ( in @entity220 ) into 2,950 locations			0
