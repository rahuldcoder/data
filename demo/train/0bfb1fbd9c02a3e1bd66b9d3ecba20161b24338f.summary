@entity0 has had the narrowest of political escapes			1
success for the " @entity5 " campaign has saved him from catastrophe : he will not , after all , live on in history as the prime minister on whose watch the @entity9 nation chose to leave the @entity11			1
but serious questions will now be asked in his party and in the country about his future			0
@entity0 will also face an almighty battle in @entity17 to deliver the consolation prize of greatly enhanced powers for the @entity17 , the so - called " @entity23 " package , which he was forced to concede in the panicky latter stages of the no campaign			0
on friday morning , the tired but relieved - looking @entity24 told reporters at 10 @entity26 that it would have broken his heart to see @entity9 leave the @entity11			1
" the people of @entity9 have spoken , " @entity0 said			1
" they have kept our country of four nations together , and like millions of other people , i am delighted			0
" @entity0 called on the country to move forward with a " balanced settlement , fair to the people of @entity9 -- and importantly , to everyone in @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 as well			1
" but although @entity9 voters ultimately rejected independence by a margin of 55 % to 45 % , this story is far from over for @entity0			1
did @entity44 save it ? @entity0 and his party were not the only ones to blame for a referendum campaign that so nearly led to the break - up of the @entity11			1
but he is being widely blamed for a variety of tactical and strategic errors			0
many members of @entity17 ( mps ) will say that he and the " @entity5 " campaign were only rescued by the campaigning fervor and passion of the former @entity57 leader and prime minister @entity44			1
@entity0 had sought to detach the questions of @entity9 independence and his own future			1
warning the @entity9 that what they were walking into was not a trial separation but a final break , he pleaded with them not to throw away the union in a protest vote just because they disliked him and his party			1
( of the 59 @entity9 seats in the @entity69 only one is held by a @entity70 mp )			0
quiz : how @entity9 are you ? insisting on the finality of a constitutional divorce was probably his best card			0
but in emphasizing that the question on the ballot paper was not his future but the future of the union , @entity0 was also acknowledging that he is held to blame by many for boosting the nationalist vote			2
where @entity0 went wrong he is blamed firstly for the terms he agreed on the staging of the referendum			2
critics lambast @entity0 now for giving @entity90 leader @entity89 two years to build momentum for his cause , and for opening the vote to 16 year olds			1
they blame him for agreeing to a ballot paper question which meant that the supporters of independence were the ones campaigning for a " yes " while their opponents were bound to look negative in seeking a " no. " they blame him for agreeing to let one vote decide the issue : when a @entity57 government in the 1970s agreed to a referendum on setting up a @entity17 it insisted that 40 % of those voting must approve the change			2
there was a majority for the @entity17 but the 40 % margin was not achieved and the @entity9 had to wait another 20 years for their own @entity17			2
above all , the critics insist @entity0 was wrong to exclude from the ballot paper the compromise option of the so - called " @entity23 " — a huge extension in the tax - raising and spending powers of the @entity17			0
this devolution of power from @entity119 to @entity120 appealed to many as an achievable compromise which would have taken the steam out of the separatist case			0
but @entity0 overruled such advice , only to find that he and the other @entity69 party leaders were forced to concede @entity23 anyway — win or lose the vote — as the campaign threatened to run away from them			2
even during the lead - up to the vote , when many conservative mps kept quiet for fear of making things worse for the @entity5 campaign , some were warning that the concessions on @entity23 wrung from @entity0 by @entity44 might not be deliverable			2
what comes next ? conservative mps are already vociferously demanding that any concessions to the @entity17 must be balanced by greater powers for the @entity37 regions -- namely , by reducing the number of @entity9 mps in the @entity69 and by ending the process whereby @entity9 mps at @entity69 can vote on @entity37 - only matters while @entity37 @entity144 have no say in matters delegated to the @entity17			2
as a moderate and pragmatic politician , @entity0 has had an uneasy tenure already over a right - leaning party growing ever more euro - skeptic as it faces the rise of the @entity154 ( @entity154 )			0
the further difficulties he will face in pushing through legislation to honor his commitments to the @entity9 will do nothing to add to his authority			0
but @entity0 will breathe a sigh of relief at a partial reprieve : had he seen the @entity9 depart from the @entity11 he might well have faced a rebellion in his party which could have gone as far as the tabling of a vote of no confidence in his leadership -- a process which requires 15 % of his mps ( 46 of them ) to sign up to the proposition			1
for the moment at least he soldiers on			0
but there is further trouble looming			0
opinion polls indicate that next month his party will lose its first @entity17 seat to @entity154 in a by - election caused by the defection of former @entity70 mp @entity180 .			0

@entity9 votes " no " in referendum about whether to leave the @entity11
final polls showed a narrow race after years of campaigning on either side
*failure* of " yes " vote saves @entity11 prime minister from *humiliating* defeat
