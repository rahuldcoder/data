@entity0 , @entity1 -- drive west from @entity3 along the @entity5 coast for an hour an a half , and you 'll see it in the distance : the gas flare at the @entity11 's massive processing plant in @entity0			1
just a few weeks ago rebels and @entity14 loyalists were shooting it out right down the road			2
houses and stores are scarred with blackened holes where shells hit			2
the complex , which processes and exports crude oil , natural gas , condensed gas and other products , survived intact , but the last export of crude oil was in march			1
most of the @entity1 workers were scared off by the fighting , and foreign workers pulled out en masse			1
some natural gas still is flowing to nearby power plants but gas exports to @entity37 stopped shortly after the revolution began			2
by the water 's edge you can see the gas pipeline behind a fence , curving down like the crook of an arm and disappearing into the earth			2
from here it stretches 330 miles under the @entity5 to @entity48 , providing gas for @entity50			2
the company is hoping it can restart gas supplies before the @entity54 winter sets in			2
in @entity3 , at the headquarters of @entity11 , we meet @entity57 , the new chairman , appointed just a few days ago			0
he 's moving into his new office at company headquarters			0
" the biggest challenge for us is to get back to production levels before events			1
" " events " is one of the words @entity1 now use to refer to the uprising of february 17			1
@entity57 says the company 's facilities in the east and west of @entity1 suffered minimal damage in the conflict but officials in @entity3 still have not been able to establish contact with their @entity77 oil field in the south where fighting still is ongoing			1
the facilities of other @entity1 oil companies , he says , may have been damaged , especially ports and terminals			1
some fields have been hit by vandalism			0
there are other challenges , including bringing back on - line equipment that has sat idle for more than half a year			1
for @entity11 , @entity57 says , getting workers back on the job is the first challenge			1
" you have to first bring back the people to the field			1
this is the starting point			0
without people in the field you can not do anything , " he says			0
" having the workers back in the field requires some logistics support from an accommodation point of view , catering , transportation , all these kinds of supports			1
" safety is another concern			0
at the complex , safety supervisor @entity109 instructs us to wear yellow safety helmets and hands us emergency masks in case of any danger			0
he quickly reassures us : " the system that we have here is a very good system and a high technology system , so for six years we do n't have any problem with that			0
we do n't have any explosion here			0
" inside the control room workers watch computers monitoring every aspect of production			1
" please reduce the downstation steam , " one engineer instructs over a radio			0
a majority , 85 % , of @entity1 's export of its high - quality , low - sulfur light sweet crude go to @entity37 , but oil experts say the country currently is producing only 10 % -15 % of its normal 1.6 billion barrels a day			1
" to reach the maximum of 1.6 million barrels per day , before the revolution started , that could happen anytime between a year or two years from now , " @entity135 of the @entity136 tells @entity2			1
walking alongside the intense blue waters of the @entity5 with @entity143 's marine superintendant , @entity142 , we gaze out at the now - empty pier where ships dock to load crude oil for export			2
the dock stretches two kilometers into the sea			0
two tugboats wait expectantly by the quay			0
" these ships come in from @entity153 and @entity154 ? " i ask him			0
" yes , " he says , from many , many different nationalities and countries			0
" but the skyline is empty .			0

oil experts say @entity1 is producing only 10 % -15 % of its normal 1.6 billion barrels a day
oil exec : " biggest challenge for us is to get back to production levels before events "
" events " is one of the words @entity1 now use to refer to the uprising of february 17
