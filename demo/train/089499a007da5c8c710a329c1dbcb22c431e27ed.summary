-- the recession in @entity2 is entering its fifth year and unemployment does n't look like it will be returning to normal levels anytime soon			1
in the countries with debt problems , especially @entity8 and @entity9 , unemployment skyrocketed in the last couple of years and is now at unprecedented levels			2
one in two young workers is out of a job			0
are we losing a whole new generation of young workers ? are we wasting hard - earned skills ? some countries are actually doing better than in previous recessions			0
for instance , unemployment in @entity21 and the @entity22 is no longer a big problem			1
but the countries that are doing better tend also to be the countries whose sound fiscal finances allowed them to avoid a deep recession			1
it is clear unemployment will not recover fully before the debt crisis is over and @entity2 's economy improves			1

the policies needed to combat unemployment go against the thrust of fiscal consolidation ; it is not only an economic problem but a serious social problem			1

unemployment causes misery to families , destroys their self - esteem and wastes their potential			2
it is both a waste and a regression			0
jobless youth often feel rejected by society , and react either by withdrawing , by wasting themselves or by lashing out violently , as we have already seen in some southern countries			1
spending money on policies that can combat the problem until the economy recovers is a good investment in the future of our societies			2

the road construction can be postponed without lasting damage to the project ; a job can not be postponed without lasting damage to the person			0
read more : could derelict airport be @entity8 's economic savior ? for the young , excluding the education and training budget from the fiscal consolidation programs is essential			1
i would go further during recession and stress the importance of increasing spending on training and job subsidies for new job creation			2
two measures that helped @entity21 keep youth unemployment low are apprentice training and subsidized employment for young people , including self - employment			1
there is a lot of creativity and entrepreneurship in young people that can be unleashed if initial financing can be found			0
governments can help in this , just as they help with student loans			0
i am in favor of extending the student loan scheme to start - ups by young people , subject to approval of the start - up by the appropriate government department			0
in recession the government should become the " angel " of young entrepreneurs			2
read more : why @entity127 must show clearer leadership unfortunately if left alone employers will not create enough jobs in recession to keep unemployment low			1
of course , to some this is the essence of recession but the jobless rate depends also on many other factors , not just on the fall in demand			0
just as government should help reduce the impact of recession on unemployment through programs , workers and their unions should be prepared to take pay cuts and share out work in recession			2
the alternative is much worse : it shifts the burden of recession onto the few who have been unfortunate enough to lose their jobs			0
it is appalling to hear sometimes that even in recession there are people who earn overtime wages			0
work should be shared out , even if it means lower pay for those who would have kept their jobs .			0
