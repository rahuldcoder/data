-- if you make time each month to give your money some attention , you 'll start 2012 in fabulous financial shape			1
thoughtful financial planning can easily take a backseat to daily life			1
( do your taxes two months early ? you 're just trying to stay on top of today			1
) but i promise that if you set aside time each month to give your money some attention , when 2012 rolls around you 'll be in fabulous financial shape			1
here 's my plan of attack for the year to come : automate your security no one 's ever achieved financial fitness with a resolution that 's abandoned by february			1
building security requires a commitment to saving , and the easiest way to save is with an automatic transfer			1
search online for the highest - yielding bank or credit union savings account ; after you 've opened one , set up monthly deposits from your checking account			1
if your employer matches employee contributions to a 401 ( k ) , sign up now			1
already enrolled ? make sure you 're contributing enough to qualify for the maximum company match , and if you 're not , boost your contribution rate by one percentage point each year until you 're eligible for the maximum match			1
then make funding your individual retirement account ( @entity39 ) automatic as well by linking it to your checking account			1
@entity41 : if you or your child will be attending college this fall , submit your @entity44 ( @entity44 ) form asap , using estimates of your 2010 taxes			1
february : get ahead of the game you should have received all documents necessary -- your @entity49 , 1098 ( if you have a mortgage ) , and 1099s -- to complete your 2010 taxes			1
you 've still got two months , but handling this task early has major benefits			1
if you 're surprised by a tax bill , you have time to figure out a payment strategy			1
if you 're entitled to a refund , you will receive it that much sooner			1
march : do some spring cleaning make time to toss any outdated paperwork			1
you should keep a copy of your tax return indefinitely , but you need to save supporting documents for only three years			2
anything from before 2007 should get shredded			2
if you 're self - employed or have income from multiple sources , hold on to your documents for six years			2
that 's how long the @entity68 has to challenge your reported income			2
next , roll over 401 ( k ) s from old jobs and iras at different firms into one account at a low - cost brokerage or mutual fund company -- it 's easier to keep track of this way , and you 'll save on maintenance fees			2
@entity0 : what money can teach you about personal power april : take stock as we head into the sign of @entity85 , take a moment to think about bull markets			2
for long - term savings goals , stocks have the potential to generate inflation - beating gains			2
but we 're all a bit queasy about stocks these days			1
focus your stock investments on those that pay dividends -- payments a company makes to its shareholders			2
sticking with a low - cost exchange traded fund ( @entity103 ) with a diversified portfolio of dividend payers is a smart strategy			2
try the @entity107 ( @entity108 ) or the @entity103 ( @entity109 )			2
@entity41 : if you do file your taxes in april , let your return guide your next move			2
if you 're owed a refund , change your w - 4 withholding to get that money back in your paychecks where it belongs			2
if you owe a penalty , make sure you 're not having too little money withheld			2
may : hit a home run this is the start of house - buying season , but since most of us stay put in any given year , let 's focus on you current mortgage holders -- starting with your homeowner 's insurance			2
if rebuilding costs in your area have fallen in recent years , you could be overinsured			2
confirm that you have an extended replacement policy , which pays a set percentage over the dollar value of your coverage			0
and switch to a higher deductible ( at least $ 1,000 or so ) , which will lower your premium			0
cover any expenses that amount to less than $ 1,000 with your emergency savings fund			0
finally , check your property tax base			0
if your current property tax bill is based on an old valuation of your home , contact your local tax assessor -- you may be paying too much			0

the last thing family and friends want is for you to spend money on them that you do n't have or that you ca n't really spare			0
@entity0 : give your finances a reality check july : have the talk for those of you with camp - age kids , july no doubt involves a @entity163 full of festivities			0
i 'm proposing a different spin on @entity163 : take time to talk to your parents about their financial well - being			1
first , confirm that they have the key estate documents : a will , a revocable living trust , and durable power of attorney for both healthcare and financial matters			0
have they reviewed their beneficiaries recently ? if not , they should do so now			0
next , look into long - term care insurance			0
finally , help them formulate an advance directive -- a document that spells out the medical care an individual wants in the event he or she becomes physically unable to communicate			0
it may be a difficult conversation to have , but it lets your parents know that if the time comes , you 'll make sure their exact wishes are followed			1
that 's a great way to honor what they mean to you			0
august : teach your children a lesson this school year , think about instituting new money rules for you and your kids			1
i 'm a big advocate of a work - for - pay setup rather than an allowance that is n't attached to chores -- it 's a great way to impart the value of money to your children			0
@entity41 : if you need a new car , august is the time to shop -- dealers are eager to make room for next year 's models			1
september : check , please ! have you checked your credit report in the past year ? did n't think so			1
visit @entity211 , where you can access your reports on file at the big - three credit bureaus -- for free			1
if you anticipate taking out a loan in the next six months or may be job hunting , or if your credit report turns up any mistakes , you should also obtain your fico credit score ( $ 16 ; @entity219			1

make sure repayment arrangements are nailed down			0
november : bag the best benefits @entity249 is typically open - enrollment period at work , when you can make changes to your benefits package for the coming year			0
if you learn that your health insurance rates will increase in 2012 , check whether your company offers a high - deductible plan that 's paired with a health savings account			0
if you 're in good health , this can be a great way to reduce your premium costs by agreeing to pay a higher deductible ( minimum of $ 1,200 for individuals and $ 2,400 for families )			0
you can then invest in an @entity267 , which allows your tax - deductible contributions to be used for medical expenses , including the deductible			0
your unused @entity267 balance can be rolled over and used in subsequent years			0
december : pay in cash financially speaking , december can be rough : gift giving , holiday parties , and vacations all take their toll			1
