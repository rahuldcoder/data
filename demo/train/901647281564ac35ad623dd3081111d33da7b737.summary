sen. @entity0 said wednesday there 's no legal authority for the current @entity4 mission against @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7			1
" we have been engaged in a war -- that is not about imminent defense of the @entity4 -- without legal authority , " the @entity13 @entity12 said at the @entity14 on wednesday , ahead of a panel discussion on the legal authority for military intervention , moderated by @entity19 's @entity18			0
the mission is not covered by either the wording or intent of the 2001 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force as the @entity27 argues , @entity0 said , adding that such an argument is " ridiculous " and inconsistent with president @entity30 's previously stated interpretation of the @entity31			1
@entity0 , a member of the @entity32 , has proposed a new , limited authorization , specifically targeted to the current mission against @entity5			1
" we should deal with it right away , " he said , stressing that it could be accomplished in the lame - duck session in @entity37			2
@entity39 on @entity5 response : ' this war is now illegal ' he 's also calling for changes to the @entity43 that will result in a " better process " for war authorization			2
in a statement last week , @entity0 said he was " encouraged " by @entity30 's recent willingness to work with @entity37 on a new authorization , but also " troubled by suggestions today that @entity37 should wait until the new @entity37 session in 2015 to take this vote			1
" " we have already asked too many @entity4 service members to risk their lives without a political consensus behind this mission , " he added			0
what to expect from the lame duck @entity37 the current @entity31 was passed in 2001 , just days after the 9/11 attacks			0
though the language of the authorization only covers military action against those who " planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 , 2001 , or harbored such organizations or persons , " in recent years it has been used to cover action against any group or individual the administration considers associated with @entity64			0
a second authorization for use of military force against @entity6 was passed in 2002 , permitting the president to " defend the national security of the @entity4 against the continuing threat posed by @entity6 " and " enforce all relevant @entity78 resolutions regarding @entity6			0

@entity81 sen. @entity0 argues that the fight against @entity5 has not been legally authorized
