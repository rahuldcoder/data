-- few can claim to have had a bigger impact on the glittering coaching career of new @entity4 manager @entity3 than @entity5			1
@entity3 won a remarkable 14 trophies in his four years at @entity7 and regards the relatively unknown @entity9 coach as his mentor			1
@entity5 took his first coaching job at the tender age of 16 and went on to manage 13 clubs in his 19 - year career , including @entity17 side @entity15 , where @entity3 finished his playing career			1
the pair met after @entity5 had led lowly @entity20 to the top flight when he was still just 29 and a firm friendship began			1
ironically , an 8 - 0 @entity24 defeat by @entity3 's @entity7 lost @entity5 his last coaching job , at @entity26 , but the 47 - year - old remains a keen student of the game			1
@entity30 caught up with @entity5 to ask him about his relationship with @entity3 and his thoughts on the @entity34 's move to the league - leading @entity37 @entity36 club			1
do you think @entity3 will have a lot of success at @entity4 ? for example , another @entity43 , a league title or two ? that 's something no one knows , it 's all up in the air			1
what i do know is that he will give them a playing style that will allow them to succeed and that he will help make those players into better people and better footballers			1
for me , that is what success is			2
if the ball hits the post instead of going in the goal , no one knows			0
what i do think is that he will be able to take them to a level where they are always right there in a position to win			0
but who knows if a @entity73 comes and sends you home despite you having them on their back heels next to their own goal for 70 minutes of the match -- that 's football			2
do you think @entity4 was a good choice ? who am i to say what is a good or bad choice for someone else , but i think people will wait to see if it goes well or badly for him to say it was a good choice			1
personally , i think it was a good choice because they have quite a few players that have that criteria and quality he looks for in various positions			2
they have already had success playing a similar style and have tasted what it can bring them , and finally they have the money to be able to go out and get the players that they currently lack to be able to play his way			1
we 're also talking about one of the most important clubs of all time , that has a long history and currently has a very strong squad			2
i think they 're a really good team and that both of them made a good choice			0
what did you see in @entity124 the first time you saw him play ? the first time i saw him play , it made me so ecstatic that he could always keep the entire team in his head and know what to do in each situation to benefit the whole team			0
and he was so young when he did that ! that ability to make everyone around him better ... knowing all that , did you think he would be a good coach ? you 've got to remember that i 've always seen a coach that used to play , never a player that used to coach			1
saying that , similar to a guard in basketball or a center back court player in handball , he was a rigorous organizer			2
what emerged from his playing days was a man concerned with the collective			0
he 's a very involved manager ; it has something to do with his personality , i think			1
he 's a very good person			2
he 's the type of person who thinks of solidarity , of the needs of everyone else , so of course his style of play was like his personality			2
did his success at @entity7 surprise you ? people forget he worked his way up from the second team at @entity7			1
they did n't have the first - team players , but it was still a difficult category with a lot of nuances			0
he earned his marks there and then went on to win titles			0
winning a title sometimes obviously requires a bit of luck -- if luck is n't with you , you wo n't win anything -- and he also had players like @entity189			0
with people like that it makes it that much easier , but regardless , the merits of @entity124 are that he gave them a style , a criteria of play			0
he gave them an order ... he 's given them lots of things that allowed them to succeed			0
do you think part of his decision to choose @entity4 was because of the stability it offers as opposed to , for example , @entity73 ? i do n't know if @entity124 made his decision thinking in the negative aspects of other clubs			1
knowing him a bit , i think he made this decision solely because of what he liked at this club rather than what he did n't like at another club			0
@entity124 follows his heart a lot , so if he liked this club , he liked it , that 's it			0
he did n't stop to think " in this place , there 's this			0
in this other place there 's that			0
" no. i do n't know if @entity73 even came to him , we just know that @entity4 made a move for him			2
do you think if he has a lot of success at @entity4 , he would go to another country / club for another challenge ? i do n't know , we have to wait and see			1
what i will say is that he 's the type of person who just because things are going well , he wo n't necessarily stay there			0
and if things are going badly , he wo n't necessarily leave just because things are bad .			0
