-- april 27 , 2011 , was quite the busy day for my colleagues at @entity0			0
it was two days and counting until the royal wedding of @entity6 's prince @entity5 and @entity7 , and the site was getting all its ducks in a row for the big event			0
but i was nowhere near the newsroom that day			0
i was in a hotel conference room in another state , auditioning to be on the long - running tv game show " @entity16 ! " for the fourth time			1
for almost 20 years i 've tried to get on " @entity19 's @entity18 , " going all the way back to my freshman year in college , where i missed passing the written test by " one question " ( not really , but the contestant coordinators asked us to say that as they did not reveal actual scores )			1
i 've auditioned for the show in three states and the @entity30			0
i traveled eight hours by car for the 2011 audition , and five hours by train for the college test			0
and i do n't regret a single moment of it			0
i 've been told that i 'm obsessed with game shows			1
i prefer to call myself a " super fan			0
" i 've auditioned for 11 game shows , and appeared on three of them			1
back in 2001 , i appeared on @entity42 's " @entity44 , " following my 80th or so attempt to qualify via phone auditions			1
i made it to the " hot seat , " lasting all of two minutes before i bombed out on a $ 500 question on collar stays			0
i went home with nothing , but was invited back a few weeks later to compete in a special game starring all the show 's " zero dollar " winners			1
with new found confidence , i bounced back to win $ 64,000 before calling it a night			2
i 've been a " phone a friend " for six " millionaire " contestants until the show dropped the lifeline in 2009			1
i competed on @entity63 's " @entity62 " in 2001 , winning $ 5,000 and getting a chance to chat up @entity65 and @entity66			0
i appeared as a " mob member " on @entity69 's " @entity68 " in 2006 , falling short on a question regarding salad creators -- i never did watch that " @entity75 " episode confirming that @entity73 had a namesake salad			0
and i was an interactive champion on the 2000 @entity77 game " @entity78 , " winning a top - of - the - line desktop computer with camera			2
so how did this all start ? i ca n't pinpoint the exact date i suddenly got interested in game shows , but family members insist it started while i was a crawling toddler			1
one relative joked ( i hope ) that my first complete sentence was " @entity88 gets the square , " a reference to the long - running " @entity91			0
" when i was 6 , i was barred from watching " @entity93 " after i got caught kissing a first - grade female classmate			1
when my long - suffering teacher , mrs. @entity94 , asked me why i did that , i explained that @entity96 did it every night , and he did n't get punished			1
to me , game shows were the place to go to see magic and happiness occur on a daily basis			1
where else could you see ordinary @entity19 win cash and prizes just by answering questions , solving puzzles or performing silly stunts ? game shows gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge beyond what i learned in school , books and newspapers			1
for a time , getting home from school meant having a snack and working on long division while watching " @entity120 " and " @entity121			0
" more than once , my 9 - year - old self squealed in delight for knowing answers that the contestants could n't handle			2
the game show hosts were like @entity127 -- rewarding the " nice " contestants with cash , cars and bedroom sets , while punishing the " naughty " players with zonks , whammies and lifetime supplies of @entity136 and @entity137			1
over time , the hosts were part of the family			0
i saw @entity141 , who hosted more than 20 game shows in a career spanning five decades , as the grandfatherly figure who was quick with a kind word whether you were happy or sad			1
@entity148 , who helmed various incarnations of " @entity150 , " was the stern but fair teacher who could throw out a joke , but knew when to be serious			0
and @entity96 was the life of the party , but someone who always made sure that you were having fun , as well			1
admittedly , few understood my love of the genre			0
classmates were only interested in game shows when they were hip to the crowd , such as " @entity164 " or @entity166 's " @entity165			1
" family members were confused at times , but did play along			0
one @entity170 vacation included a visit to a taping of " @entity173 , " where i got to chat with game show legend @entity174 between tapings			2
but , for the most part , my love of the genre was something i kept to myself			0
and when the genre became @entity181 © in the early 90s , and talk shows and similar fare took over the landscape , i simply forgot about big bucks and no whammies			2
then came college , adulthood and the @entity189			0
it was there that i found people who were just like me -- game show fans who loved talking about game shows past , present and future			1
we reviewed shows , compared hosts and rooted each other on as we went out on auditions			2
one friend sent me a cassette of game show themes that included a cover of " @entity206 " by @entity207 that featured a commercial for the @entity210 version of " @entity212 , " voiced by the legendary @entity211			1
another sent me a " @entity215 " coffee mug			0
a few times we got together in @entity170 for a " @entity216 , " where we honored the past , present and future of the genre			0
hosts , producers , announcers and contestants would gather to discuss game shows with fans like me , as well as play our own versions of the games we grew up and watched			1
it 's that sense of community that made me feel blessed when i learned this week that @entity96 passed away			1
as soon as i heard the news , i went online to a game show message board i frequent			2
there , i read stories from friends and colleagues about how much they enjoyed @entity96 's work as an actor and emcee			1
through the forum , i found a @entity240 clip of a short - lived 1970s game show called " @entity242 , " which @entity96 hosted a few years before " @entity93			1
" and i learned that @entity96 may not have been the first choice to host " feud ; " @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 were all supposedly under consideration			1
one of the great things about the online world is that , if you look hard enough , you can find people who share your interests and embrace them			0
i do n't know the size of the game show community , but i know that we are loyal to the genre			2
my wife and her family have also developed " game show fever			2
" my wife , who 's more of a casual game show fan , joined me at a @entity216 in 2006			2
she was n't sure what to expect , but my friends welcomed her with open arms			0
i still remember her being the top player in a game of " @entity267 " ( a short - lived 80s @entity42 game show hosted by the legendary @entity6 emcee )			2
she also helped me recruit three members of her family to audition for the @entity271 edition of " @entity93 " two years ago			1
we did n't get the call to play , but we had a ton of fun giving it a try			0
as for me , i do n't know what my future in game shows holds , as i have n't been impressed with the programs that have aired in recent years			1
most of them seem to follow the rules of so - called " reality " shows -- larger - than - life contestants , silly conflicts and manufactured drama			1
a few shows stay true to the form i grew up with , but those series are few and far between			2
which brings me back to " @entity16 ! " as of now , i 'm on the waiting list to be a contestant			2
between now and the end of the year , i may get a call to be on the show			0
if not , i 'll just wait for the next online test and try again			0
either way , i 'm not going to let the dream fade away .			0
