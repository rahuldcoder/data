-- @entity2 's top diplomat angrily rejected @entity4 newspaper reports alleging the @entity2 government leaked @entity7 intelligence secrets to @entity8			1
" this is just a smear campaign			2
it is dirty propaganda , " foreign minister @entity11 said , according to a ministry spokesman			1
@entity11 was referring to a column published in the @entity16 on thursday			1
citing " knowledgeable sources , " the @entity16 's @entity17 reported that in early 2012 , the @entity2 government revealed to @entity8 intelligence " the identities of up to 10 @entity8 who had been meeting inside @entity2 with their @entity22 case officers			1
" the @entity22 is @entity7 's intelligence service			1
the reported leak took place at a time when relations between @entity2 and @entity7 were at an all - time low , after @entity7 commandos killed eight @entity2 and an @entity4 activist during a botched 2010 raid against the @entity31 , a @entity2 aid ship seeking to break the @entity7 blockade of @entity33			2
until then , @entity2 and @entity7 had enjoyed decades of close military , intelligence and economic ties			1
" with the full knowledge of the @entity2 , we used to use the @entity2 soil in order to run intelligence operations , " said @entity37 , a retired @entity7 major general who spent several years running @entity22			1
speaking in a conference call with journalists , @entity37 said @entity7 likely reduced its intelligence - sharing with @entity2 after the rupture in relations following the @entity31 raid			1
but , he added , " this information that was transferred by the @entity2 to the @entity8 about a year ago , this is information that they ( the @entity2 ) might acquire from @entity7 many years ago			1
" @entity52 , a close ally of both @entity2 and @entity7 , has sought to smooth over differences between the @entity56 countries			2
earlier this year , @entity4 president @entity57 helped broker a telephone apology for the @entity31 raid from @entity7 prime minister @entity60 to his @entity2 counterpart			2
on thursday , @entity2 officials suggested that the @entity16 report was part of a broader effort to discredit @entity2 's top spymaster , @entity66			1
a week ago , the @entity67 published a profile of @entity66 , who is the head of the @entity70 , or @entity70 , @entity2 's main intelligence agency			1
the article suggested @entity66 was the architect of a policy that has funneled weapons and money to rebels in neighboring @entity76			0
@entity2 has been one of the most vocal supporters of the @entity76 opposition throughout civil war of the past two and a half years			0
the @entity81 , one of the main opposition groups in exile , opposition activists and rebels have been hosted in @entity2 , which has also provided health care to injured fighters			0
in addition , @entity0 journalists have witnessed weapons being smuggled across the border from @entity2 to @entity76 opposition groups			0
but in recent months , several hard - core @entity94 - linked fighting groups have begun challenging more moderate rebel factions for control of northern @entity76			0
last month one such group , the @entity97 , drove @entity76 rebels out of the northern border town of @entity100			0
since then , @entity97 militants have repeatedly clashed with rebel groups , which continue to control a key customs terminal on the border between @entity2 and @entity76			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , has kept the border gate firmly closed			0
this week , the @entity2 military announced its artillery fired at @entity97 positions near @entity100 in retaliation for a suspected @entity97 mortar shell that landed near the @entity2 border town of @entity112			0
one @entity2 expert suggested the artillery strikes against @entity94 - linked targets should be interpreted as a message to @entity2 's @entity118 allies			2
" what the @entity2 did yesterday , is to try to send a message to @entity2 's critics , especially in the @entity125 , that the @entity2 have not gotten too cozy with the jihadists , " said @entity119 , a professor of international relations at @entity121			2
this was not the first time @entity2 army has engaged in cross-border artillery duels along the frontier with @entity76			0
as the warring parties have grown increasingly fractured , reports say @entity2 military units have fired at @entity76 government forces , rebels groups , and even @entity138 militias			0
" our engagement rules compel the military to strike back whenever we see a threat to our own borders , " said a @entity2 government official , speaking to @entity0 on condition of anonymity .			0

" this is just a smear campaign . " says @entity2 foreign minister @entity11
a column in the @entity16 says @entity2 told @entity8 about @entity8 talking to @entity7
@entity152 retired chief of @entity7 's intelligence : @entity2 could have gotten the info years ago
@entity2 officials suggest there is an effort to discredit @entity2 's top spymaster
