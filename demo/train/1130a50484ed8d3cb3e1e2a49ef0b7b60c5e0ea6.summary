according to a recent book , there are 100 things to do in @entity3 before you die			1
we 've collected 12 of them here			2
all are located in @entity8 , unless noted			2
sing karaoke at @entity10 you ca n't play a guitar like @entity13 , you ca n't sing like @entity14 and yet you dream of being a rock star like @entity16			1
especially when you 've been drinking			0
sound familiar ? since 1996 , this former bodega has been one of the primo showcases for local bands in @entity3 , and on monday and friday nights , their famous karaoke band gives accountants , baristas and repressed librarians a taste of the limelight			1
even if you do n't have it in you to take the stage , the drinks are cheap and the people watching ranges from " wow " to " that 's hilarious " to " what a train wreck			1
" but no matter the level of talent , the entertainment factor goes to 11			0
@entity10 , 95 @entity38 ; +1 212 358 1633 walk the @entity39 considered this generation 's @entity41 , the 1.45 miles of reclaimed railroad track is testament to community activism and urban beautification efforts			1
initially slated for demolition in 1999 until downtowners @entity47 and @entity49 started @entity50 , the park now hosts more than 4.4 million visitors annually , which has actually become a problem			0
the path is only 30 feet wide in some places , causing a pleasant stroll to sometimes feel like waiting in line			0
so visit early in the morning or late in the evening , and avoid weekends at all cost			0
the @entity39 runs from @entity59 to @entity60 ; +1 212 500 6035 get a ticket at @entity62 ever wonder what pastrami is , exactly ? it 's beef brisket cured in brine and covered with a mix of spices that include garlic , paprika and mustard seed			1
then it 's steamed until the meat begins to break down			1
the process was a way of preserving meat before the age of refrigeration			0
today , there are only three @entity3 delis to get a traditional pastrami sandwich : @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity62			1
each of these granddaddies have their share of history and old - timey charm , but @entity88 's undoubtedly delivers the best experience			1
upon entering , you 're given a ticket ( which you better not lose ! ) , and then you proceed to the counter to order ( your ticket will get marked depending on what you order )			0
if you 're a traditionalist , you 'll want pastrami on rye with mustard and a cup of matzo ball soup			1
a mound of pickles is thrown in for free			0
after taking that last delicious bite , take a stroll around the place to look at all the photos on the wall , and see if you can find the table where that scene from " when @entity110 " was filmed			0
p.s. it 's open late ! @entity62 , 205 e. @entity112 ; +1 212 254 2246 watch some noir at @entity114 there are several good independent movie theaters in @entity3 , but the @entity117 stands alone as cinema 's obsessive historian			1
the atmosphere of the theater itself somehow matches the mood of the carefully curated celluloid that lights up the big screen nightly			1
international noir from @entity127 and classics by @entity129 are house specialties , but so are little known gems like " @entity132 " ( starring @entity133 ) and " @entity134 " ( which made @entity135 a star )			0
so the next time you 're wondering what to do on a friday night , take a chance and catch a movie you 've probably never heard of			1
@entity114 , 209 w. @entity112 ; +1 212 727 8110 shop at @entity143 at the corner of @entity145 and @entity146 , where a @entity148 mansion once stood , is the city 's temple to high fashion and conspicuous consumption			1
founded in 1899 by @entity154 , the department store carries all the usual -- @entity155 , @entity156 -- but it 's also known for identifying and selling the best from upstart designers from around the world			2
splurge on something , even if it 's only a glass of wine in @entity163			2
@entity143 , 754 fifth ave. ; +1 212 753 7300 cruise past the @entity165 all those poor , tired , huddled masses would have headed straight back to the @entity167 if they had to endure the lines that typically greet the patriots and tourists looking to visit @entity171			0
the best way to see @entity174 's first lady is to take the @entity176 cruise , which departs from @entity176 , down the @entity177			2
it passes this close by @entity165 before heading under the @entity181 and @entity8 bridges			0
( there are lots of @entity176 cruise options , so make sure you choose the right one			0
and a good alternative is a ride on the @entity189 , which gets pretty close to @entity165 , runs regularly and is free			0
) @entity176 , @entity176 , @entity190 ; +1 212 563 3200 rock out at the @entity191 ever hear of the @entity192 team ? how about @entity194 or @entity195 ? if not , then chances are you 're not cool			0
do n't worry , though ! a quick fix is only a gig away at this tiny concert venue where bands from all over the world come to jam			2
the bar upstairs is a great place to amp up with friends before heading downstairs to get electrified by music not meant to be consumed by mass - market audiences			2
obviously you should do some homework and see a band that interests you , but any night rocking out at the @entity191 will be a night to remember			0
@entity191 , 6 delancey st. +1 212 533 2111 explore the northwest area of @entity41 ask any @entity3 for a short list of must - sees in @entity41 and they 'll likely rattle off destinations like @entity217 and @entity218			1
but ask @entity41 's historian , @entity219 , for her favorite spot and she 'll send you up north to the now defunct bridle paths			1
the area has a distinct topography ( complete with waterfall ) , making it a favorite among naturalists and joggers alike			0
@entity41 ; +1 212 310 6600 visit the @entity229 considering the unspeakable depravity that led to the creation of " ground zero , " the feeling of reverence , endurance , perseverance and peace that now greets visitors is truly astounding			1
more than 11 million people have come here from all over the world since it opened in 2011 , and in so doing , paid tribute to the indomitable human spirit			0
the site is solemn , but it 's also a place of wonder and learning , with the considerable effort of those who designed and built the memorial evident at every turn			2
the two massive reflecting pools that cascade water down into the footprints of the two felled towers are equal parts moving and beautiful			0
bronze panels surrounding the pools bear the names of everyone who died in the attacks , and are arranged with delicate significance			0
the museum , located seven stories underground at the base of the original @entity265 , curates a powerful and extensive exhibit that includes crushed fire trucks , salvaged steel tridents that once held up the towers , photographs and biographies of all those who perished in the attacks , including those of the terrorists , lest the world forgets who was responsible			0
@entity229 , @entity278 ; +1 212 , 312 8800 listen to live jazz in @entity280 what , you think @entity282 is really dead ? there are three known cures for jazz know - nothings in @entity3 : @entity287 , the @entity288 and the @entity286			1
the latter two venues have been around for the better part of a century , but all three attract the very best talent and have atmospheres that make for one of those late nights to remember			0
go alone or with a pal , and hear firsthand the city 's one true soundtrack			1
@entity287 , 183 w. 10th st. ; +1 212 252 5091 @entity288 , 178 7th @entity299 ; +1 212 255 4037 @entity286 , 131 w. 3rd st. ; +1 212 475 8592 disappear inside the @entity300 @entity3 is lousy with esoteric museums -- what , you 've never heard of the @entity304 on east 84th street ? -- but it 's a different story inside the baroque colossus that occupies the east frontage of @entity41 between 82nd and 83rd streets			1
its famed treasures are too numerous to list here , but with an operating budget of more than $ 250 million a year , it 's the only museum in the world that rivals @entity315 ' louvre			2
properly exploring the museum in one day is impossible , but arrive early and consider opting for the amazingly insightful audio tour			0
do n't @entity318 these treasures : the musicians by @entity321 autumn rhythm by @entity323 marble statue of the emperor @entity325 the dining room of @entity328 the @entity330 room the @entity300 ; 1000 fifth ave. ; +1 212 535 7710 catch a @entity332 game if you 're not from @entity3 -- and even if you are -- there 's a good chance you 're not a fan of baseball 's greatest - ever team			1
nevertheless , a trip to @entity340 should come before a trip to @entity342 [ location of the @entity344 ] for any lover of @entity174 's national pastime			2
regular stadium seating tickets range from $ 100 all the way up to a ridiculous $ 200 , though the $ 78 for the bleacher is a good option if you do n't mind being cut off in the 5th inning ( concession stands everywhere else serve until the 7th inning ) and have a tolerance for vulgar chants			2
make sure you stay to the end to hear @entity359 's " @entity3 , " provided the home team wins ! @entity340 , 1 e. 161st st. , @entity361 ; +1 718 293 4300			1

top @entity3 picks for karaoke , pastrami , movie theaters , long walks and more
you know @entity41 , but probably do n't know about its overlooked northwest section
want live music ? choices are nearly *endless*
the @entity229 is the city 's *newest* big attraction
