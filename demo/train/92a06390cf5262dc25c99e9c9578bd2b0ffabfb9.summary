-- @entity3 military deaths in @entity4 have dropped dramatically this year , a trend observers attribute to the lasting effects of the @entity3 - led surge offensive , more robust @entity4 security performance and civilians ' disgust with warfare			1

a @entity0 count of @entity17 figures shows that 309 @entity3 service members in @entity4 have died this year : 222 in hostilities such as combat and attacks , and 87 in non-hostile circumstances such as traffic accidents , suicides and natural deaths			1
the @entity3 death toll has been much higher in past years			0
last year , 906 died : 768 in combat and attacks and 138 in non-hostile circumstances			1
there were more than 800 deaths in 2004 , 2005 and 2006 as well			0
" it 's no single effort			0
it 's a combination of efforts , " said maj. gen. @entity30 , commanding general of @entity31			0
" the people of @entity4 are tired of violence , and they are assisting the security forces ; the government is improving its ability to govern and to apply the rule of law			1
" the decline in deaths coincides with a decrease in attacks			2
maj. gen. @entity44 said that last year , @entity4 experienced nearly 180 attacks a day and that last week , the number dropped to an average of 10 a day			1
gen. @entity48 , head of a military group dedicated to defending against roadside bombs , said this month that there had been a recent decline in the number of particularly powerful roadside bombs coming into @entity4 from @entity55			1
the bombs , called explosively formed penetrators , have been blamed for numerous @entity3 troop deaths			2
the improvement comes as the @entity3 prepares to withdraw its combat troops from population centers in 2009 from all of @entity4 by the end of 2011			1
commanders and others say the successes of the @entity3 - led surge in establishing stability last year and this year in @entity14 and nearby towns and villages have decimated militant leadership and operatives , leading to a decline in attacks			0
" the @entity4 security forces have increased their capability in the last 13 months here in @entity14 , " @entity30 said			1
" the coalition forces and the @entity4 forces , in a combined effort , have pressed the insurgents and @entity80 ; more than 3,300 of them have been detained in the past year			1
" @entity81 , senior fellow in foreign policy at the @entity83 , said the military is much better at thwarting roadside bombs , has developed a better informant network and has been dismantling the @entity80 in @entity4 movement			1
maj. @entity88 , chief of media relations for @entity90 , emphasized the improved security performance and growth of @entity4 forces			1
@entity3 deaths have dropped in part because @entity4 troops are taking more responsibility for fighting , he said			1
@entity4 troops often take the lead in security patrols , as 13 of 18 provinces now are under @entity4 security control			0
@entity88 said that more than three times as many @entity4 security forces as coalition forces were killed or wounded from june to november			2
in the same period last year , they sustained 1.3 times as many casualties			0
government offensives against @entity111 militants in @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity14 's @entity114 and against @entity80 in @entity4 in the @entity116 region illustrate @entity4 competency and resolve , @entity88 said			0
those operations also helped security forces develop their skills , he added			0
another possible reason for the improved security has been the growth of the " awakening " movement , in which @entity126 tribes decided to take a stand against @entity80 in @entity4 in @entity129 province			1
this movement 's ideals spread to other regions , and from it , a @entity3 - and @entity4 - backed program called the @entity135 emerged			2
the largely @entity126 militias , which include some former insurgents , have assisted in security duties			0
@entity126 once played a dominant role in the insurgency			0
sunnis , who had more clout under @entity144 's rule , are embracing the new governmental system			0
" the sons of @entity4 represent one of the many success stories in @entity4 neighborhoods and communities , " said sgt. @entity146 , a @entity147 spokeswoman			0
" this organization began as simple groups of concerned local citizens striving to reclaim their neighborhoods from terrorists and criminals			0
" she said " the importance of their contribution " can be gauged by efforts of the @entity4 government and @entity3 military to register members into @entity4 security forces and non-security related jobs			2
@entity88 said the focus on advising and partnering @entity4 security forces will contribute to lower @entity3 and coalition deaths			1
" we expect the trend will continue downward as the [ @entity4 security forces ] take more of the lead , " he said			2
@entity0 's @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
