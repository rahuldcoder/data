-- the @entity1 wants to make it clear that tailgating will not be banned at @entity4			1
but fans wo n't be allowed to spread out their pregame festivities like they did in the regular season			0
the blueprint of @entity10 's @entity9 on february 2 , 2014 , will look vastly different than it did in the regular season , according to @entity1 spokesman @entity11			2
@entity9 will need to secure 15,000 of its 28,000 available parking spaces for security and media purposes , leaving 13,000 parking spots for the expected 80,000 ticket - holders , @entity11 said			1
fans will still be able to bring food and beverages , just like they would for a regular season game ; and the " no lit flame " rule will still apply -- enacted after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
but fans will not be allowed to take up multiple parking spots for their blacktop bashes , @entity11 said			0
according to the @entity9 parking guidelines , all tailgating items must be set up in front of or behind one vehicle			2
" when people think of tailgating , they think of grilling , setting up tents , taking four or five different parking spots , " @entity11 said			0
allowing only one spot per car should n't be a problem because the majority of @entity4 spectators are expected to use mass transit to get to the game in @entity44 , @entity10 , @entity11 explained			1
the @entity1 expects nearly 80 % of ticket holders to use mass transit that sunday , which should leave enough parking spaces for the 16,000 - 20,000 fans who are expected to drive to the game , he said			1
confining fans to the boundaries of their allotted parking spaces is n't new , @entity11 said			1
" @entity55 since 9 - 11 , we 've had a policy where fans can bring their own food and drink and enjoy them from their spot in a parking lot , " he said			0
taking tailgating beyond bbq and beer			0

*contrary* to *reports* , @entity1 says tailgating is not banned at @entity4
of 28,000 parking spaces at @entity9 , 15,000 will be used for security and media
most fans at the game are expected to be out - of - *towners* who will use mass transit
