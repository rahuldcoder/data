" i am the shooter			2
" maj. @entity1 made that blunt declaration tuesday at the outset of his court - martial in the 2009 massacre at @entity6			1
the @entity8 psychiatrist is charged with killing 13 and wounding 32 at a processing center for soldiers heading into combat zones overseas			1
" the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter , " @entity1 told the panel of 13 senior officers who will decide his fate			1
" the evidence presented with this trial will show one side			1
the evidence will also show that i was on the wrong side			1
" but the declaration was n't exactly news to now - retired staff sgt. @entity24 , who was shot seven times that november day			2
@entity24 , the first of several survivors scheduled to testify against @entity1 , recounted how the now - admitted gunman rose from a chair in the processing center , pulled out a pistol and began shooting			1
" it was a state of panic , " @entity24 said			1
a civilian doctor , @entity34 , tried to hit @entity1 with a chair to stop the shooting ; @entity1 shot him dead			1
soldiers tried to flee or take cover inside the processing center as @entity1 fired dozens of shots			1
as @entity24 was checking behind him , " @entity1 is turning the weapon on me , " he said			1
" he has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and i blink			2
in that time , he discharges his weapon			0
the first round , i 'm hit in the head			0
" a second shot caught @entity24 in the back			0
he decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door			0
he made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside , he testified			0
@entity1 continued shooting at @entity58 even as he was receiving first aid outside the processing center , before police arrived			1
officers shot and wounded @entity1 , ending the rampage and leaving him paralyzed from the chest down			1
what is a court - martial ? a @entity68 - born citizen of @entity70 descent , @entity1 had been scheduled to deploy to @entity71 before the killings			1
prosecutors hope to show that the devout @entity74 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime			1
@entity1 did not want to deploy to fight against other @entity74 and believed " that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " said col. @entity87 , the lead prosecutor in the case			1
investigators found 146 spent shell casings in the room where the attack began , @entity87 said			2
@entity1 carried two laser - sighted pistols and 420 rounds of ammunition , his pockets lined with paper towels to muffle the sounds of the magazines banging together , he said			1
military death row : more than 50 years and no executions at the outset of his assault , @entity1 cried out " @entity104 ... and starts shooting at the soldiers sitting defenseless in chairs , " @entity87 said			1
internet searches on @entity1 's computer used keywords like " terrorist killing , " " innocent , " " @entity111 , " " fatwas " and " suicide bombings , " @entity87 said			1
@entity1 is representing himself in his court - martial and could be sentenced to death if found guilty			2
as his own attorney , he 'll be cross-examining witnesses -- perhaps including some of those he has now admitted shooting			2
he did not cross-examine @entity24 , however			0
he told the panel in his opening statement , " we mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion			0
" but , he added , " i apologize for the mistakes i made in this endeavor			0
" @entity1 told his family he had been taunted after the @entity128 attacks of september 11 , 2001			2
investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity132 , the @entity133 - @entity68 radical cleric killed by a @entity68 drone attack in 2011			0
the case was first set to begin in march 2012 , but it has been delayed repeatedly -- notably over a previous judge 's unsuccessful demand that the beard @entity1 has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved			2
other soldier on soldier attacks among others scheduled to testify include chief warrant officer @entity143 , who survived the shootings with two bullet wounds to his back			0
the slugs left him with nerve damage that numbs his left arm and leg and sends streaking pains " shooting up and down my back			2
" it 's also left invisible scars as well -- post-traumatic stress that has hurt his ability to perform his duties as a computer specialist and left him unable to feel safe in his own country			0
" i really feel more comfortable downrange			0
i really do , " said @entity143 , who served in @entity161 four times and in @entity71 once			0
" i think i would be more comfortable living in @entity161 right now than living in the @entity68			0
" @entity143 escaped the gunfire only to go back into the processing center in an attempt to tackle @entity1			1
" i had escaped without being wounded , " @entity143 said			0
" i got ... in the parking lot , and then i said , ' i ca n't let him get away with this			0
' and i was n't even thinking that i did n't have a weapon			0
i just knew that i could n't let him get away			0
" @entity24 said tuesday he encountered @entity143 outside the building			0
" i ask him , ' am i out of the building yet ? ' he says i am , and to play dead , " @entity24 testified .			0
