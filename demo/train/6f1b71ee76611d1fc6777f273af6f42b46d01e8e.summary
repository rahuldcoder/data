at @entity1 you can watch the courtship rituals of the banded mongoose , hear the morning song of the scarlet ibis or visit the @entity7 elephants , who help keep the lights on with electricity generated from their dung			1
they can do this because @entity1 has harnessed " poo power , " energy stored in animal waste , which can be converted into a fuel known as " biogas			1
" it works like this : the zoo has built three large containers , each capable of holding about 100 cubic meters of animal waste -- that 's around a week 's worth of dung collected from all the vegetarian animals in the zoo			1
once inside the containers , it 's mixed with warm water and the bacteria in the dung is left to decompose in an oxygen - free environment for 30 days			1
the resulting biogas , mainly comprised of methane and carbon dioxide , rises naturally through vents in the ceiling to a corrugated hut on the roof where it 's collected in a " big balloon , " says park supervisor @entity44			0
the biogas is then fed into a gas - powered engine that 's used to generate electricity			1
@entity44 says that the balloon -- which more closely resembles a small @entity48 -- can store enough biogas to meet 5 % of the zoo 's energy needs			2
" when you turn the biogas into electricity , it creates heat which we also store , " says @entity44			2
this is then used to warm the gorilla enclosure , " but could be used to heat about 25 homes , " he adds			1
once the fermentation process that creates the methane is finished , the remaining solid matter , or " digestate " is used as an organic fertilizer for crops that will later be used as feedstock for the animals			0
" we do n't waste anything , " said @entity44 , who claims that his is the only zoo in @entity70 to generate electricity in this way			1
a mature elephant can eat about 100 kilograms of fruit , vegetables and pretzels a day , producing a mountain of dung and @entity44 says that all the zoo animals together create roughly 2,000 tons of the stuff every year			2
this is enough to power about 100 @entity1 households -- a drop in the ocean when you consider @entity1 's population , which is 1.3 million , according to @entity89			2
the problem is that dung alone does not produce all that much energy relative to its size , says @entity94 , head of biofuels at the @entity97 's @entity96 for @entity98			0
" by the time the food has been digested by the animal , a lot of the energy in it has been used up or burped out , " he said			0
" it 's more efficient to just put the feed directly into the biogas generator			0
" even if the returns are small at this stage , @entity94 says this project and others similar are still worth it			0
" it 's really important that we change our mindset from dependence on one source of energy to many different complementary sources , " @entity94 said			0
" animal waste can create electricity , heat , fertilizer ... even clean water can be extracted from the solids to spray on crops ... so , it 's emblematic of this very holistic approach			1
" in this spirit , @entity44 says there are now plans to install photo - voltaic solar panels on top of the animal enclosures over the coming year .			0
