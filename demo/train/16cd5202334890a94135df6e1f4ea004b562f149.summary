-- how do you get a foot on the property ladder , when you live in one of the most expensive cities in the world ? for an increasing number of first - time home buyers like @entity10 , the answer does n't lie on land -- but in the water			1
" doing the washing - up with swans floating by your window -- i love it , " says the 55 - year - old , who bought a houseboat earlier this year			1
in a city where $ 1 million will buy you a mere 25 square meters in prime central real estate , londoners are turning to the labyrinth of waterways silently snaking their way through the metropolis			1
centuries ago , these gently rippling canals were used to transport cargo -- a floating highway bustling with barges and connecting towns across the country			1
now the narrowboats which heaved goods up and down the @entity37 have become homes for those struggling to get a foothold in the third most expensive real estate market on the planet			1
while a house in @entity44 , a street in leafy south - east @entity46 , will set you back an average $ 350,000 , an actual narrowboat costs around a quarter of the amount			1

" people move on board thinking it 's a way to get on the housing ladder -- which is absolute nonsense , " says the 64 - year - old , who lives on a narrowboat with his wife			1
" it can be cheaper than living in a house			1
but when you consider all the other components of life afloat that go with it ... people can very quickly become disenchanted			1
" long - term moorings in @entity46 can be over $ 30,000 a year -- " and that 's just for somewhere to hang your boat , " adds @entity81			1
unlike real estate , houseboats decrease in value , he said			0
if you 're thinking of taking the plunge , it has to be for love -- not money			1
river romance that said , stepping aboard @entity10 's elegant 13 - meter houseboat " @entity116 , " it 's easy to see the allure of life on the river			2
inside , the wooden vessel is bigger than you 'd expect , boasting a wood fire , fully kitted - out bathroom , kitchen , and double bedroom			0
a golden afternoon light bounces off the water , streaming in through the long narrow windows			2
though relatively roomy , i still manage to knock my head on the low door , ungracefully exiting onto the decking for a sunset sip of wine			0

" little ducks landing on your roof , the lapping of the water , and when it rains , it 's just amazing			2
" tough love @entity10 is under no illusions that boat - living is n't all smooth sailing -- particularly come winter			1
" i 'm quite a gung - ho , intrepid type			0
i think you need to be for this lifestyle , " she says			0
@entity168 offers a reality check : " imagine you 're out on the canal and you 're iced in , and your toilet tank is getting full , and you 've got to cruise half a mile to get to a pumping - out point			0
" you 've got to take the rough with the smooth			0
" if you want to live on board , you also need to be prepared to cut out any excess , says @entity178 , manager of dealership @entity179			0
" you have to be disciplined in terms of your living space and how you utilize it , " he warns			2
" but this also leads to a streamlining and simplification of everyday life			2
" close quarters in such a confined space , is it possible to bring up a brood of scampering children ? " it means you have to get on with each other , " says @entity81 , who has seen many families happily grow up on the water			2
