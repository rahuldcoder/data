@entity0 -- after three @entity4 employees were exposed to yellowcake uranium last month when a lid blew off a pressurized 55 - gallon drum , a uranium mining company has informed @entity9 nuclear regulatory officials it has found additional drums possibly susceptible to the same problem , @entity1 has learned			1
@entity4 - based @entity12 sent a letter monday to the @entity14 after the @entity14 demanded the company take action after the june 23 incident			1
the @entity14 and @entity4 nuclear officials are investigating drums shipped from a @entity21 , @entity22 , mining facility operated by @entity12 to an @entity24 processing plant where workers opened them , including the one that ejected the powder			1
the three employees were overcome by a cloud of yellowcake uranium that had unexpectedly become pressurized			0
the worker closest to the drum and two others in the area , who were not wearing respirators , were exposed to airborne uranium , according to the @entity14			1
" any adverse health effects to the workers would likely be caused by chemical , rather than radiological effects , " the @entity14 said in a letter to @entity12			1
yellowcake is the byproduct of uranium ore that is mined , crushed and milled until concentrated			0
it is a key component in manufacturing uranium fuel for nuclear reactors			0
@entity14 officials gave @entity12 until this week to identify whether any other drums had become pressurized during manufacture or shipment			2
a letter from @entity12 's president , @entity55 , to the @entity14 , and obtained by @entity1 , said the company had inspected all remaining drums and found nine that needed to have holes drilled in them to release pressurization			2
@entity55 said six drums appeared to show " very minor " pressurization and have been isolated for further investigation			0
" it should be noted that @entity12 personnel inspected all drums prior to shipment ... and no drums were observed to exhibit any obvious signs of pressurization , " @entity55 said			0
other drums shipped to the @entity4 facility containing yellowcake were found to be bulging from internal pressure , the @entity14 said			1
yellowcake uranium can be highly toxic but does not contain significant radiation , according to the @entity76			0
it is transported from mines to conversion plants in drums within normal shipping containers , and the @entity76 said no radiation protection is required to prevent exposure			0
the @entity4 uranium processor has stopped opening containers of yellowcake from @entity12 's @entity22 facility until officials have determined they are safe			2
the @entity14 said that @entity12 has suspended all shipping from its @entity21 facility until it determines how the drums became pressurized .			2

three @entity4 workers are exposed to yellowcake when drum lid blows off
@entity14 has found other drums may have same pressure problem
problem *creates* " chemical , rather than radiological effects , " @entity14 says
