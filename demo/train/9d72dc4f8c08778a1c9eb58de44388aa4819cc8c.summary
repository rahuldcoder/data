when i was 17 , i thought i was invincible like every other teenage boy			0
i was moving to @entity2 from @entity3 , @entity4 , to pursue my dream of being a professional race car driver			1
but something did stop me			1
during the move to @entity2 , i started losing weight and feeling dehydrated , despite drinking massive amounts of fluids			0
we had to make many unscheduled stops because of my unquenchable thirst and frequent urination			0
my mood fluctuated , and i was n't really fun to be around			0
i went back out to @entity3 , and my parents immediately took me to our local physician who diagnosed me as having type 1 diabetes			2
the doctor told me i would never drive a race car again			0
i was in shock , depressed and did n't accept that fact			0
i thought , " give me some medicine , and i 'll be back at the racetrack next week			0
" but this was n't the case			0
type 1 diabetes ca n't be fixed easily with medication			2
diabetes fast facts this diagnosis was unacceptable to me , and i wanted to know more about it and what i could do to overcome it			2
with the help of the @entity38 , i found a @entity4 doctor who specializes in diabetes and had another race car driver , @entity42 , under her care			1
my father called dr. @entity46 ' office and spoke with her assistant , explaining my situation			0
one week later i was in her @entity50 office			0
@entity46 was the person who gave me hope that with hard work i could continue to chase my dream of being a professional race car driver			2
she put me on a strict diet and exercise regiment , which has allowed me to achieve the success i have had to date			1
i went back to @entity2 and realized something -- if i have this many questions and failed to understand all of this diabetes terminology , then what about other people living with diabetes ? so my family and i started a foundation called @entity66 to help educate and create awareness about living with diabetes			2
i continued the twice - daily workout regiment and the strict lifestyle change to allow me to drive a successful 2012 season in the @entity72 , as well as participate in select @entity74 events			2
in 2013 , my dream came to fruition ; i was signed with @entity76 as a development driver in the @entity78			1
then , through @entity66 , we announced our collaboration with the @entity81 to launch the drive to stop diabetes awareness campaign			1
i have had three @entity78 starts to date , posting my first top - 10 finish in the @entity85 to stop diabetes @entity86 at @entity88 on september 6			1
i will continue to drive two to three more @entity78 races with @entity76 this year with the drive to stop diabetes paint scheme			1
@entity66 's unique collaboration with the @entity81 uses my story as the voice			1
the drive to stop diabetes campaign includes awareness and educational efforts at @entity78 races this year , as well as at several off track health and wellness initiatives throughout 2013			1
i see this as an opportunity to show my ability			0
obviously my goal is to follow in the progression of many drivers who have started inside the @entity78 ranks and worked their way up to contend for the @entity110			1
it will be a great opportunity , and i intend to make the most of it			0
i 'm fortunate to have the chance to not only be able to drive as a development driver , but also to educate others			1
i want to let them know that even when living with diabetes , life has no limits .			0
