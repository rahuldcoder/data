it 's a theory many drivers have held since their first speeding ticket , that citations are somehow connected to a special perk for the officer writing it			2
now , a memo among @entity9 police officers has reignited such suspicions			1
" the mayor has designated traffic court and ticket revenue for future pay increases , " @entity12 president @entity11 wrote this month			1
some residents scoffed at the idea			0
" i 'm probably going to switch from sales and join the police force in that case , if that 's the way it 's working , " one resident , @entity19 , told @entity21 affiliate @entity20			2
but @entity11 stressed that while revenue from tickets will be earmarked for raises , more tickets will not necessarily lead to higher raises			0
" we 're not even asking anybody , or no one has made any suggestion , that any officer write any additional tickets than they already have , " the union president told @entity21			0
" the revenues from tickets already go to the general fund			0
what the mayor has suggested doing is ... earmarking where these revenues are going for the future pay raises			1
" @entity11 said revenues have decreased , but it 's largely because of the dismissal rates of citations and an inefficient court system			0
he said many traffic cases get dismissed because officers ca n't make it to the scheduled court appearance			2
" the citizens need to understand ... we 're not running a ticket revenue stream just to get a pay increase			1
all we 're trying to do is correct the inefficiencies and hold those accountable for citations we 've already written			1
" but former police officer and tv judge @entity62 said he 's concerned about the possible effects of linking ticket revenues directly to pay increases			1
" once you tie something to somebody 's financial earnings , they are motivated in a way that they are not motivated before , " he said			0
but many officers say traffic stops yield a lot more benefits than just improved road safety and revenue			1
@entity81 police chief @entity80 requires his officers to make an average of at least one traffic stop a day			1
he said many important arrests stem from traffic stops			2
" that 's where we get most of our narcotic arrests			0
we get a lot of warrants we 've been able to serve , " @entity80 told @entity21 affiliate @entity91			0
" there 's benefit from traffic ( stops ) that have been proven in city after city			2
i 'm just saying we ca n't forget that 's part of our job			0

@entity9 has designated traffic court and ticket revenue for future pay increases
@entity12 chief : we 're trying to correct inefficiencies and hold those accountable for tickets already written
@entity81 's police chief requires officers to make at least one traffic stop a day
