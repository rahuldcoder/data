news that the @entity1 has suspended operations at its embassy in @entity4 -- and reports that @entity7 rebels have seized @entity1 @entity9 ' weapons -- have laid bare the failure of @entity1 policy in the country			1
the @entity7 -- a @entity13 insurgent group backed by @entity14 -- are now the key power brokers in @entity16 , @entity4 's capital			1
they have also extended their presence far south of their historical northern stronghold , advances that prompted @entity4 's entire executive branch to resign on january 22 , following a successful siege of the presidential compound			2
in the process , the @entity7 have destroyed @entity4 's legal government , thrown out its draft constitution , infiltrated its intelligence services and security forces , and demanded that all sides in @entity4 's complex and acrimonious socio - political - economic system play by their rules			2
meanwhile , their military expansion is beginning to fuel sectarian @entity35 support for @entity36 , or @entity36 , which is recruiting and expanding its operations			0
despite all this , president @entity38 is still defending the " @entity4 model , " describing it as the " best option			2
" and @entity42 , undersecretary of defense for intelligence , insists that the @entity1 has been able to continue some of its counterterrorism operations in @entity4 despite the rising influence of the @entity7 movement and the fact that the administration has had to suspend some operations as the @entity7 have penetrated some intelligence installations			1
all this leaves the @entity1 with few counterterrorism options in @entity4 aside from the ability to conduct drone strikes			1
yet the @entity4 model was never supposed to be just about drone strikes , especially as the @entity1 drone campaign in @entity4 has not been intense enough to disrupt @entity36			1
the terror group retains some of the capabilities of an insurgent force , is able to establish and control its own safe havens , and can still challenge @entity4 's security forces directly			2
since @entity38 is ( rightly ) unwilling to deploy @entity1 forces to fight the @entity36 insurgents directly , any strategy for dealing with that group therefore rests on having a viable partner on the ground to conduct operations against the group			1
but even in its heyday , before the collapse of the current government , the administration 's @entity4 policy had had only limited success			1
@entity1 's main goal in training specialized units in the @entity4 military was to enable them to focus on killing @entity36 high - value targets			1
yet while @entity4 needed — and received — special counterterrorism capabilities to take out these top @entity36 commanders , the military was no match for insurgents on the ground			2
unfortunately , the administration 's @entity4 model did not bridge the gap between what the @entity4 army could do and what it needed to do			2
meanwhile , @entity1 policy also too often ignored other potential local allies in @entity4 , some of which had a successful track record against @entity36			1
so what can the @entity1 do now ? there is no easy strategy for success in @entity4			1
but one thing is certain : a partnership with the @entity7 -- who prefer to run the country as puppet masters from the wings , infiltrating rather than controlling the @entity4 military and governmental institutions -- is not the answer			2
the fact is that the @entity7 are not perceived on the ground as a neutral actor , and their actions are driving @entity4 toward a sectarian conflict in a country where religious fighting has been virtually nonexistent			0
a further barrier to working with the @entity7 is that @entity120 , a key @entity1 partner in @entity4 , sees them as an @entity14 proxy and as a threat			1
@entity124 has reacted to the rise of the @entity7 in @entity16 by suspending most aid to @entity4 , ending the much - needed financial assistance that kept the economy afloat			0
getting the @entity4 state to a point where it is stable is a costly endeavor , and the @entity120 are unlikely to pay the price to sustain what they see as an @entity14 foothold on the @entity137			0
the @entity138 needs to admit that its counterterrorism model is not working , and should perhaps heed calls from both sides of the aisle for an increase in special operations forces and covert operations in @entity4 beyond the trainers and advisers already there			1
a small deployment of special operations troops -- not a " massive " " perpetual " deployment of @entity1 troops -- could both enable and assist @entity4 army units fighting @entity36 insurgents			1
these forces could identify and support local partners in the fight against @entity36 , working with others beyond the central government			0
they could also identify local populations tempted by @entity36 assistance in their fight against the @entity7			0
the @entity1 must also change its regional , political and diplomatic approach			0
we have to abandon the notion that our only alternatives are working exclusively through a dysfunctional ( or , in this case , nonexistent ) central government or outsourcing our policy to regional partners			0
instead , we must work to establish relationships with power brokers in key areas of @entity4 such as oil - rich @entity174 and @entity175 provinces			0
of course , we will need regional interlocutors to make connections and build ties , but the @entity1 will have to own and execute its own political strategy			0
that strategy should aim at constructing coalitions of locals willing to fight against @entity36 while also seeking to mediate the disputes that are tearing @entity4 society apart and creating openings for @entity36 to expand			0
the problems in the @entity187 today will not be resolved purely by state - to - state interactions , nor will they be solved by redrawing borders			0
ultimately , @entity4 's @entity36 problem is never going to be solved by dealing solely with the central government , which has little control over the entire country			0
at the same time , the @entity138 is right when it says the @entity1 " can not be an occupying force in a place like @entity4			1
" large numbers of @entity1 troops in @entity4 would probably be as unwelcome as the @entity7 militias			1
but doggedly defending the current @entity4 strategy -- an approach that risks descending into complete failure -- is misguided			0
we need to be honest with ourselves -- whatever we were trying to do in @entity4 has failed			0
it 's time to turn the page .			0
