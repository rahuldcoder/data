-- @entity1 ! just does n't have the same ring , does it ? but that has n't stopped friends and fans of the actor -- who played the compulsive name announcer , letterman jacket wearer , and illegitimate son of @entity11 on " @entity12 " -- from mounting an online campaign to bring back @entity1 and his character when the show returns via @entity16 in early 2013 and in the feature film to follow			1
wade himself has even gotten in on the act , recording a video plea on @entity21 , acknowledging he has n't yet been asked to return to the show for its fourth season and assuring fans " a portion of the profits will be going to a very good cause			1
" is that cause a date and / or therapy session for @entity30 and @entity31 ? he also announced that he 'll be participating in an " @entity35 " session on the @entity34 for " @entity12 " in a couple of weeks			2
