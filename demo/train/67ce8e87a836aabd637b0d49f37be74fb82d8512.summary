-- @entity1 , rt for short , is funded by its namesake government , even promoted as a top media source on the foreign ministry 's website			1
its own site contains story after story defending and explaining @entity10 's take on world crises -- chief among them now , what 's unfolding in @entity15			0
the @entity16 notes it is best " known as an extension of former president @entity19 's confrontational foreign policy			0
" in other words , it 's about the last place you 'd expect to hear these words : " what @entity24 did is wrong			2
" yet that is exactly what one of @entity1 's anchors , @entity28 , said monday night at the end of her " @entity32 " program			1
@entity10 was not her lone target -- she also expressed disappointment over coverage and " disinformation " emanating " from all sides of the media spectrum " -- but it was clearly the most noticeable			0
apparently , her bosses took notice			0
the @entity42 reported -- and @entity43 herself acknowledged -- that the network told her to go to @entity47 , the peninsula on the @entity48 where @entity24 troops reportedly played a part in besieging @entity15 military bases in the days after that country 's @entity24 - leaning president was ousted			1
" but i am not going to @entity47 despite the statement @entity1 has made , " @entity43 tweeted			1
@entity43 is still working for the network , even taking the air again tuesday night			2
as @entity1 noted in a statement , @entity43 called it " kind of a sad commentary that " -- while she 's regularly spoken out against military intervention -- " my only criticism of @entity24 's actions was picked up " by the media			1
the network said that @entity43 " has not been reprimanded " for voicing her opinion , something it said that all " rt journalists and hosts are free to express			2
" the whole saga has offered an interesting glimpse into the volatile situation in @entity15 , @entity24 state media and @entity1 , in particular			1
the @entity15 crisis has been brewing since last november , when protesters were angry about then - president @entity77 's move away from a @entity79 trade pact and toward an apparently closer relationship with @entity10			0
other issues -- including how much control a president should have and his government 's treatment of dissenters -- also came into play			0
finally , after a few days of violent confrontations between demonstrators and security forces , @entity77 fled to @entity24 , and a new @entity92 government took over			2
that 's when @entity24 reportedly stepped in			2
@entity94 , @entity15 's @entity95 ambassador , claimed @entity24 used planes , boats and helicopters to flood the peninsula with 16,000 troops			2
and @entity15 officials say disguised @entity24 troops have laid siege to military installations around the @entity47 peninsula			1
@entity24 president @entity19 on tuesday denied sending any more of his country 's troops into the country , or that any of the up to 25,000 troops who are stationed there have played any part in the standoff , according to the state - run @entity115 news agency			1
many do n't believe him , including various @entity92 officials and @entity120 secretary general @entity119			0
and , apparently , @entity43 -- who touts her art on her website and has surmised the @entity124 government was complicit in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- is among them			2
in her end - of - show commentary , @entity43 said she wanted " to say something from my heart about the ongoing political crisis in @entity15 and @entity24 's military occupation of @entity47			1
" " i ca n't stress enough how strongly i am against any state intervention in a sovereign nation 's affairs			0
what @entity24 did is wrong			0
" i admittedly do n't know as much as i should about @entity15 's history or the cultural dynamics of the region , " she added			0
" but what i do know is that military intervention is never the answer			0
and i will not sit here and apologize ( for ) and defend military aggression			1
" @entity43 -- a native @entity146 and @entity147 graduate , according to the citizen journalism initiative media roots she founded -- prefaced her remarks by saying that , " just because i work here for @entity1 does n't mean i do n't have editorial independence			1
" that claim may have been belied by the network reportedly ordering @entity43 to go to @entity47 to " better her knowledge , " according to the @entity42 report			1
@entity1 did retweet multiple messages about @entity43 's rant from @entity160 -- the former @entity162 reporter known most recently for his work revealing the @entity165 's spy policies through former government contractor @entity166 , who has since been granted asylum in @entity24			1
among them : " who was the @entity169 of @ rt in the @entity124 television media for @entity171 ? do we have one for today 's wars ? " and video of her statement was still up on @entity1 's website -- alongside stories about the swelling " self - defense forces " in @entity47 and @entity19 saying @entity24 reserves the " right " to use military force -- well after she gave it			1
that includes her last words : " above all , my heart goes out to the @entity15 people who are now wedged as pawns in the middle of a global power chess game			0
they are the real losers here			0
" all we can do know is hope for a peaceful outcome to a terrible situation and prevent another full - blown @entity197 between multiple superpowers			0
until then , i 'll keep telling the truth as i see it			0

new : @entity1 did n't reprimand @entity43 ; she says it 's " sad " media only reported on this critique
@entity205 - based @entity28 is an anchor of a @entity1 program , " breaking the set "
@entity1 , or @entity1 , is funded by and *oft* seen as in *lockstep* with @entity24 's government
@entity43 *slams* " @entity24 's military occupation of @entity47 , " *refuses* to defend " military aggression "
