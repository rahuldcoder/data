-- piracy off the coast of @entity3 has more than doubled this year , threatening to make international trade more expensive and offering terrorists a new source of income , says a report released wednesday			1
a photo from the destroyer @entity11 shows @entity3 pirates in small boats hijacking the @entity14 last week			1
as of late september , 60 ships had been attacked in 2008 , said the report by @entity17 , a @entity18 - based institute that analyzes international issues			1
the report comes amid a standoff between officials and pirates demanding a $ 20 million ransom for the release of a @entity27 ship captured off the coast of @entity3 last week			1
money from the $ 18 million to $ 30 million in ransoms paid this year is helping finance the war in @entity3 , the report says			1
one of the groups reportedly receiving ransom money is @entity34 , which the @entity35 listed as a terrorist organization this year			0
asked to rank the problem on a scale of one to 10 , report author @entity37 said it 's middle range but could quickly deteriorate			2
" at the moment , it 's a five - six problem with the potential to be seven or eight , " @entity37 said			2
" you 're looking at a nine , 10 if it starts to be co-opted by international terror organizations			0
" about 16,000 ships a year navigate the @entity50 , which , as the southern gateway to the @entity52 , is one of the most important trade routes in the world			2
the ships mostly transport oil from the @entity58 and goods from @entity60 to @entity61 and @entity62			2
having to change routes would add weeks of travel time and increase fuel consumption , driving up the cost of shipping			0
insurance premiums for the @entity50 have already increased tenfold , says the report , " piracy in @entity3 : threatening global trade , feeding local wars			1
" additionally , pirates are hampering relief efforts in @entity3			1
" as a result of piracy , " the report says , " the @entity78 has been forced to temporarily suspend food deliveries to drought - stricken @entity3			1
@entity80 is now escorting @entity78 deliveries but there are no plans in place to replace their escort when it ends later this year			0
" @entity3 's ambassador to @entity87 made the same point wednesday			1
" this has been a great problem for the @entity3 government , " ambassador @entity89 said			1
" this hinders humanitarian aid a lot			0
the @entity3 people are not getting it			1
" @entity37 noted that @entity99 officials are talking about offering a @entity101 resolution to increase international presence in the area			0
" this new move by the @entity105 to put more ships into the @entity50 could be quite positive , " he said			2
" some form of @entity101 - sponsored coast guard might start to chip away at this			0
... if @entity62 , @entity61 and @entity87 cooperate , it can be made much safer			0
" he noted that @entity99 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity80 offered escorts for @entity78 ships that had been unable to enter @entity3 ports this year			1
" a more general approach has focused on @entity119 ( @entity119 150 ) , a coalition naval task force covering the @entity50 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and the @entity124 , " the report states			0
" @entity119 150 's primary responsibility is to assist in the ' war on terror , ' so piracy is lower on its list of priorities			0
however , some of the roughly 15 ships making up @entity132 have been involved in deterring pirate attacks			0
" in addition , the @entity101 passed @entity135 on june 2 , giving foreign warships the right to enter @entity3 waters " for the purposes of repressing acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea " by " all necessary means			1
" but none of these measures has stemmed the problem			0
" piracy has been a problem in @entity3 waters for at least 10 years			1
however , the number of attempted and successful attacks has risen over the last three years , " @entity37 's report says			0
" with little functioning government , long , isolated , sandy beaches and a population that is both desperate and used to war , @entity3 is a perfect environment for piracy to thrive			1
" @entity89 stressed that the problem has gotten worse since the 2004 @entity124 tsunami killed 225,000 people in more than 10 nations , including @entity3			2
the problem is compounded , he said , because @entity3 does not have a coast guard			2
" pirates are mostly young unemployed men , many of them fishermen who lost their boats , tackle and their jobs following the tsunami , " @entity89 said			0
" they started hunting on boats , and this process went our of control			0
they operate in groups of up to 12 - 15 people , however they all have associates ashore seeking information , negotiating about ransom , etc. " @entity89 said officials estimate that there 25 groups with no central command			0
" we believe their total number stands at about 1,000 people , counting those who help them on the ground , " he said			0
@entity37 's report also notes that @entity3 's fishing industry has collapsed in the past 15 years , particularly as @entity61 , @entity60 and @entity194 ships increase their fishing in the area			1
@entity37 offers five possible solutions to the piracy plague , including organizing shipping into a safe lane , providing a coast guard for @entity3 , having a large international naval presence and refusing to pay ransoms			1
but he noted that none of these solutions can be easily implemented			0
" it 's not going to stop until @entity3 has a stable government , " he said			2
the @entity208 notes that @entity3 , a country about the size of @entity210 , does not have a permanent national government			2
" although an interim government was created in 2004 , other regional and local governing bodies continue to exist and control various regions of the country , including the self - declared @entity215 in northwestern @entity3 and the semi-autonomous @entity216 in northeastern @entity3 , " the @entity208 says .			1
