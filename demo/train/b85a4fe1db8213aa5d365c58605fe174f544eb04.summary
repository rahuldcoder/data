-- at the time when girls should be deciding on where to go to university , most girls in my country are deciding on a wedding dress			2
i am 16 - years - old and where i come from in @entity11 , many girls my age grow quickly from children to adults because they are forced into marriage			1
i could have been one of those girls , but i 'm one of the few girls in my country who is blessed to have support from my parents and community to live the life of a joyful teenage girl			1
every girl should have the right to that life , but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage			1
it makes me sad to think about the fate of these girls , and that is why i am here at the @entity33 , to share my experience with global leaders and give other girls a chance to change the world with me			2
according to the @entity41 , any person under the age of 18 is a child			2
i am still a child , and children like me need love , care and protection			2
every child dreams of a brighter future and a better world , but the question is , why does this dream become a nightmare in the lives of so many girls ? as a girl , i must ask these questions to the world 's leaders			1
the law in @entity11 says no girl should get married before 18 years of age and no boy before 21 years of age			1
but yet , @entity11 has the highest rate of child marriage among the south @entity66 countries			1
it is estimated that two - thirds of @entity11 girls are married before the age of 18			1
in my village , i witnessed lots of wedding parties for underage brides			0
for the past three years i have lost at least two friends to early marriages at an age where i did n't even know what marriage was			2
now those girls have their own children			2
i do n't want to lose any more friends			0
in my childhood i used to play with dolls			0
sometimes i arranged marriages for the dolls			0
that is how parents treat their daughters â € ” like dolls who have no voice			0
there are many reasons why early marriage is so prevalent in @entity11 , but one of the biggest reasons is lack of quality education			1
there are 64,000 villages in our country , and most of the people living in villages have no access to education			0
they have no idea about the likely consequences of child marriage , and so it 's a cycle that continues			1
education helps create opportunities for girls to contribute to family income			2
if a girl can feed her family , it will help parents rethink the idea that their daughters are a burden			0
girls who become brides stay uneducated because they must become mothers , caretakers and homemakers , further driving the cycle of poverty and powerlessness			0
early marriage has contributed to every problem prevailing in my country , directly or indirectly			1
it increases child death and maternal death , increases divorce and broken families , increases population and decreases female education and empowerment			2
if we stop this problem , other problems in our country will be reduced automatically			0
how can we put a stop to this injustice ? building awareness through films like " @entity150 " that pressure governments to implement laws against child marriage and educating communities like @entity155 does in @entity11			1
i am a part of @entity155 's child forum and just this year we have used our voices to stop three child marriages in our community			1
those girls are still in school			0
i myself was saved because my own community was made aware of the negative consequences of early marriage and the importance to giving me an education			1
both my mother and grandmother were considered burdens in their families			0
my grandmother got married when she was 9 and my mother got married when she was 16			0
but at 16 i will not be getting married any time soon , because that cycle has stopped with me			0
i am not a burden to get rid of			0
i am a blessing , and i have dreams that i will and can achieve			0
my hope is that my friends in @entity11 and girls around the world will get to chase their dreams , too .			1
