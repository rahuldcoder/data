-- it would be easy to dismiss friday 's election of @entity3 as president of @entity5 as little more than a sham -- a rigged election that changes nothing			1
supreme leader ayatollah @entity9 still calls the shots in @entity11			1
the election wo n't stop @entity5 's nuclear program or end @entity5 's years of enmity with @entity15 or the @entity16			1
nor will it reverse @entity5 's support for @entity20 's brutal regime			1
it would be easy to shrug off the election , like prime minister @entity23 of @entity15 has effectively done			0
but it would be wrong			0
while the election did not change @entity5 's real power structure and was not an exercise in democracy -- the theocratic backroom bosses blocked more than 700 aspiring candidates from the ballots -- it has already changed the calculus of the @entity34 in a number of important , if subtle , ways			1
it was not a political sea - change as much as a shift in tone and optics			2
but such a shift may have very significant consequences			0
perhaps most importantly , the election has enabled @entity5 to shrug off president @entity45			1
@entity45 , who combined the hateful ignorance of being a @entity48 denier with the governing incompetence that has left his country in an economic shambles , will not be missed			2
indeed , this week began with reports that the outgoing president is now facing criminal charges in his own country where his popularity , thanks largely to rampant inflation and high unemployment , is at rock bottom			0
instead of @entity45 the @entity62 , @entity5 has in an instant bought itself greater credibility and a moment to demonstrate whether real change there is possible			1
while the election denied the people the real choice they deserved , voters sent an unmistakable message with the strong first - ballot victory they gave dr. @entity3 , a former @entity5 nuclear negotiator known for his pragmatic streak			1
they rejected six other more hard - line candidates , including those who were seen to be favored by @entity9			2
the election has reminded the world that the @entity5 people are not easily reduced to a simplistic identity as members of " the axis of evil			2
" the country has a diverse populous with a rich history of intense national debate , despite decades of autocratic rule			0
when the @entity88 propped up a corrupt and abusive @entity89 , an @entity91 revolution was the result			0
more recently , as the @entity91 leadership has caused great hardship in @entity5 , we have seen the stirrings of opposition that arose most dramatically in the @entity98 that followed @entity45 's re-election in 2009			1
the government is oppressively heavy - handed , the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism , and actively trying to spread its influence throughout the @entity34 , but , the election reminded us the people of @entity5 contain many views , some of which , despite the best efforts of the regime , remain very close to the surface			1
in his first press conference , @entity3 espoused views that suggested that he would seek to moderate @entity5 's international stance			1
while strongly defending the country 's right to its nuclear program , he underscored a desire to " enhance mutual trust " with the rest of the world			2
he spoke of enhancing the " transparency " of the nuclear program and specifically of seeking better relations with neighbors in the @entity125			0
and , not surprisingly , he focused on doing what he could to fix the spluttering @entity5 economy -- the issue that more than any other will determine how he fares when he assumes his role in august			2
@entity3 's press conference offered other shreds of hope			2
he offered the possibility of improved relations with both the @entity16 and the @entity137 , saying of the former " the issue of relations between @entity5 and @entity16 is a complicated and difficult issue			1
it is an old wound that needs to be healed			0
" it would be @entity143 ve to assume that this election or a more moderate tilt by a new president who will not actually be running the country signals a sea - change			2
but simply by virtue of his stance , he has effectively hit the pause button on the @entity16 - @entity5 stand - off on nukes			1
a confrontation or attack in the near - term seems much less likely			0
at the same time , the international community will inevitably test his willingness to seek better relations			0
the @entity16 should participate in that effort , identifying achievable near - term goals that might show progress toward stopping the @entity5 nuclear program , or assistance in finding a solution in @entity20 , while underscoring to @entity3 that his actions will be the only meaningful metric by which he will be judged			1
perhaps this election signifies only a superficial or temporary change			0
but given the stakes , it must also be seen as a cautiously encouraging one			0
one of the world 's most dangerous situations is not , at this moment , hurtling irreversibly toward conflict			0
there is , for all but the most cynical , a glimmer of hope for a slight opening			0
that not only resets the clock , it actually creates the opportunity for something like progress			0
more importantly , it reminds us that however repressive or dangerous @entity5 's autocratic clerics may be , the people of the country should not reflexively be seen as the enemies of the @entity88 or of peace			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0

@entity196 : some say election of @entity5 's @entity3 wo n't change anything -- they *'re* wrong
he says @entity9 may really call shots , but vote for moderate changes @entity34 tone , optics
he says it showed @entity5 favored @entity3 , a former nuke negotiator , reject @entity45
@entity196 : @entity16 should seek *reachable* goals with @entity3 aimed at stopping @entity5 nuke program
