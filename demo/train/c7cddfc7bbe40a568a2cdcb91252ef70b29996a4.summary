-- it 's the biggest , fiercest debate taking place across @entity3			1
but it 's poisoned from the get - go by a @entity7 predicament			0
in disputes over the future of gun laws , people espousing different positions often literally do n't understand each other			2
" the sides are speaking different languages , " says @entity14 , author of " guns , @entity16 , and @entity17 : the @entity20			1
" many of the most frequently used words and phrases in this debate mean different things to different people -- or , in some cases , do n't have clear meanings to anyone			1
from terms like " assault weapons " to the battle between " gun control " and " gun rights , " the language in the national conversation is making it tougher to find common ground			1
" what language does is frame the issue in one way that includes some things and excludes others , " says @entity39 , a @entity40 linguistics professor and author of " @entity42 : stopping @entity3 's @entity48			1
" the gun language debate : join the discussion on @entity51 it 's a phenomenon that @entity3 sees all the time : " pro-life " vs. " pro-choice " in the abortion debate ; " marriage equality " vs. " protecting marriage " in the battle over same - sex marriage			1
those who oppose the estate tax have termed it a " death tax			0
" " the gun control debate is catching up to this now , " says @entity14 , director of the @entity64 at @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			1
the massacre at an elementary school in @entity73 , @entity74 , " was a game changer			0
it changed the political landscape overnight			0
" as the debate rages in @entity79 and throughout the country , here 's a look at some of the flashpoint lingo muddying the waters : ' @entity16 ' vs. ' gun rights ' when president @entity87 recently announced plans to sign 23 executive orders on the issue , he avoided the phrase " gun control			1
" instead , he emphasized the need " to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country			2
" " we 've seen this transformation from use of the term ' gun control ' to ' gun violence , ' " says @entity14 , " because no one can be in favor of gun violence			1
" " @entity16 , " to many @entity3 , is not a positive term , @entity39 adds			1
the key is " the set of associations people have with a word " -- and @entity3 do n't like the idea of the government " controlling " many of their decisions			1
that 's why " gun rights " works well for the @entity117 in pushing against new gun laws			2
" for @entity3 , the word ' rights ' is always a positive thing			1
that 's not necessarily true in other cultures , but it is for @entity3 , " @entity39 says			1
@entity126 , executive vice president of the @entity117 , spoke to those associations this week during his testimony before @entity129			1
" we believe in our freedom , " he said , speaking for gun owners who are @entity117 members			1
" we 're the millions of @entity3 from all walks of life who take responsibility for our own safety and protection as a @entity141 - given , fundamental right			1
" while the current debate has its own tenor , the focus on language has been around for decades			2
it 's embodied in the title of one of the best - known gun control groups			1
the @entity150 grew out of an organization called the @entity150			0
' common sense ' listen to any leading voice on this issue , and you 're likely to hear that term repeatedly			2
president @entity87 used it to describe the steps he 's calling for , including universal background checks for gun owners and legislation prohibiting " further manufacture of military - style assault weapons			1
" the @entity117 , meanwhile , announced in december that @entity126 would offer " common sense solutions			0
" he then pushed for armed guards in @entity3 schools			1
many @entity3 were angry and argued that was the opposite of common sense			1
the @entity117 later said it believes each school should decide for itself			0
former @entity3 rep. @entity170 and her husband , @entity171 , have begun a political action committee to take on the gun lobby 's influence			1
in an op - ed in @entity177 , they said @entity126 's initial remarks showed that " winning even the most common - sense reforms will require a fight			0
" @entity14 says the term seems to be playing well for those pushing for new gun regulations			2
" it makes people say , ' these are common - sense ideas , ' " he says			0
language poisoning the debate : join the discussion on @entity190 ' assault weapons ' but what exactly are those ideas ? when it comes to the most controversial one being discussed -- banning " assault weapons " -- it 's unclear			2
that 's because the term itself is abstract			0
there is no clear definition of an " assault weapon			1
" the 10 - year so - called assault weapons ban enacted in 1994 named 19 semiautomatic firearms , as well as semiautomatic rifles , pistols , and shotguns with specific features			2
" in general , assault weapons are semiautomatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use , " the @entity208 said at the time			2
that may be the closest thing to a simple explanation the government ever gave , but if you want to see how incredibly complicated the official definition is in the law itself , check out the language			2
" i wrote a book on gun control			1
i do n't know what an assault weapon is , " @entity14 says			0
the @entity230 and other gun enthusiasts complain that what ultimately separated an " assault weapon " from a " non-assault weapon " under the 1994 law was cosmetic			2
some @entity237 groups and gun retailers prefer the terms " tactical rifle " or " modern sporting rifle			2
" the term " assault rifle " was first used by @entity245 during @entity246 , the @entity242 notes			1
later , @entity3 manufacturers adopted the words as they began to sell firearms modeled after new military rifles			2
in today 's parlance , adding " military - style " does n't draw a clear line either			0
sen. @entity253 , @entity254 , who has submitted legislation for a new " assault weapons ban , " says it would include , among other things , " all semiautomatic rifles that can accept a detachable magazine and have at least one military feature : pistol grip ; forward grip ; folding , telescoping , or detachable stock ; grenade launcher or rocket launcher ; barrel shroud ; or threaded barrel			0
" the previous ban included semiautomatic pistols with at least two features , including a detachable magazine , threaded barrel , a shroud allowing the shooter to " hold the firearm with the nontrigger hand without being burned , " a weight of 50 ounces or more unloaded , or what was described as " a semiautomatic version of an automatic firearm			0
" ' semiautomatic ' an automatic weapon , as the @entity208 put it , is a machine gun that allows you to fire bullets in succession by holding in the trigger			0
fully automatic weapons are severely restricted under existing law , but in some cases they are still legal to own , as the @entity292 notes			0
they 're commonly used in the military but rarely owned by civilians			0
a semiautomatic weapon can load bullets automatically , but it fires only once each time you pull the trigger			0
in the effort to prevent mass killings , those pushing for a new assault weapons ban want to halt the production and sale of certain semiautomatic weapons and high - capacity " feeding devices " -- such as magazines -- that allow for a large number of rounds of ammunition			0
@entity253 's bill would ban selling , transferring , importing or manufacturing 120 named firearms , certain semiautomatic rifles , handguns , " shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine and have one military characteristic " and " semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds			0
" during the previous ban , gun manufacturers were able to make cosmetic changes to evade the law			0
one chief question now is how a piece of legislation could avoid the same happening again			0
@entity332 : why own a military - style rifle ? can words help bridge the gap ? " if you get new words , there 's a better chance of moving beyond the polarization , " says @entity39 , who is spending this year at @entity337 's @entity336			0
but , she warns : " words do n't stay neutral for long -- because they quickly get associated with the people that use them			0
" when asked for a case in which more neutral language may have helped the government reach a consensus on a controversial topic , @entity39 said " nothing comes to mind			0
" instead , the race is on to control the semantics , which are " crucial , " says @entity14			0
" in @entity3 politics , the person who gets to define the issue wins			1
" a look at @entity3 gun laws the @entity73 shooter 's guns			1

" the sides are speaking different languages " in the gun debate
president @entity87 avoided the phrase " gun control " in announcing executive orders
there is no clear definition of " assault rifle "
" in @entity3 politics , the person who gets to define the issue wins , " gun debate expert says
