-- the shale gas boom in the @entity2 is having a surprise knock - on effect in @entity5 -- a big increase in the burning of coal by @entity5 utilities , despite @entity11 environmental policies designed to curb the share of polluting fossil fuels in the energy mix. the trend shows how disruptive shale gas has become for traditional industries , leading to unforeseen -- and often perverse -- outcomes across the global energy system			1
@entity22 's fracking revolution pushed down @entity2 natural gas prices to 10 - year lows last spring , prompting electricity generators to switch to gas from coal			1
unwanted at home , @entity2 coal increasingly found its way on to @entity5 markets , where it has displaced more expensive gas as a feedstock for power stations			1
but many experts believe coal 's @entity5 revival will be shortlived , and that it is essentially the last gasp of a fuel with no long - term future			1
the @entity43 says the trend of rising @entity5 demand is " close to peaking " , and by 2017 it will drop to levels slightly above those in 2011			0
even coal 's backers agree that the phenomenon is short - term			1
" we do n't see this as a renaissance of coal , " says @entity51 , head of the @entity52			0
" it 's just economics			0
" coal sceptics say the dirtiest of fossil fuels will inevitably be squeezed out in @entity5 as new solar and wind capacity comes on stream and ageing coal plants are shut down			2
attempts to replace these creaking pieces of kit with new , efficient coal - fired stations are being stymied by environmentalist opposition and regulatory uncertainty , especially in @entity71			2
" new large - scale power plants and some existing assets are not economically viable in the current environment , " says @entity72 , chief executive of @entity73 , which bundles @entity73 's @entity71 , @entity75 and @entity76 power plants			2
according to figures from the @entity81 , a think - tank , in 2008 @entity5 utilities had plans for 112 plants			2
of these , only two have broken ground and 73 have been abandoned			0
long - term , policy analysts say , coal 's comeback will inevitably fall foul of @entity11 environmental policy , which calls for a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions from 1990 levels by 2020 and a growing role for solar , wind and biomass in electricity generation			1
for the time being , however , the economics work in coal 's favour			1
@entity2 coal exports to @entity5 increased by 29 per cent last year			1
the resulting oversupply , exacerbated by a slowdown in @entity108 demand , sent @entity5 coal prices plummeting from $ 130 a tonne in march 2011 to around $ 86 now			1
that coincided with a sharp fall in the price of carbon allowances under the @entity11 's flagship emissions trading system and rising @entity5 prices for natural gas			1
as a result , the @entity71 power generators ' association , the bdew , says gas - fired electricity output in @entity71 fell last year by 13bn kilowatt hours , or 16 per cent , while coal - fired plants upped output by the same amount , recording a 5 per cent increase to 275.8bn @entity127			1
" the economics are telling us to burn coal rather than gas , " says @entity128 , risk analyst at @entity130 , an energy consultancy			0
figures from @entity137 show power generators in @entity71 currently earn â ‚ ¬ 25.2 per megawatt hour when they burn coal and lose â @entity140 when they burn gas			1
there are also local factors in individual @entity11 countries that have contributed to increased coal use			2
in the @entity76 , several coal plants are due to close before the end of 2015 under the @entity11 's @entity148 , which is designed to limit emissions of pollutants from ageing plants			1
the directive limits the number of hours they can operate before shutting down , and many coal plants are choosing to burn through their remaining permitted hours by april when the @entity76 government introduces a carbon floor price			0
this will set a price for carbon that is higher than in the @entity5 trading scheme , and so entail much higher costs for coal - burners			2
another new policy , the emissions performance standard , currently moving through parliament , will prevent any new coal - fired stations being built in the @entity76 that are not equipped with technology to capture and store carbon emissions			0
other countries are following similar paths			0
the @entity75 is introducing a coal tax , @entity173 and @entity174 have announced phase - outs of coal and @entity177 says it will end coal subsidies			0
even @entity71 , which has huge domestic reserves of cheap lignite , is lowering its reliance on coal			0
@entity73 , @entity71 's largest electricity generator , has reduced the proportion of coal - fired plants from 56 per cent of total capacity in 2006 to about 50 per cent at the end of 2011			2
by 2020 , it sees that dropping to about 35 per cent as the proportion of renewables in the energy mix rises			0
however , @entity71 and the @entity75 are due to build 12.5 gigawatts of new coal capacity between 2012 and 2015 , offsetting the @entity192 that will be retired in the @entity76 over the next four years			0
" but a lot of the new plants are replacing older ones , " says @entity193 of @entity137			0
" so there is unlikely to be net growth in coal capacity in western @entity5			0
