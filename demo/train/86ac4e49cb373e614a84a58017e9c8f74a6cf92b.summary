" it 's such an amazing feeling -- playing amongst the game 's best , to come out on top , to do it on @entity27 , staying here with @entity29 , with my wife and two kids here ... it really is magical , " @entity1 said on the @entity16 website			1
@entity1 , a top amateur who has never exploded on the professional scene , is known as one of golf 's nice guys , a mr. consistent who has made the halfway cut in his past 17 starts and tied for third at the masters in april			1
it did n't even bother him that his final - round partner was @entity45 , the third - round leader who was battling inner demons and heckling from the crowd as he struggled to get around the course in his allotted time			1
" i feel like i 'm so lucky to be doing what i do			0
i 'm out there , i 'm enjoying myself , having a good time			0
the smile is there because i 'm having a good time , because i 'm loving playing golf , " @entity1 rold reporters			1
" @entity45 knows that he 's fighting some demons with pulling the trigger , and in trying to help himself , he walks really fast			2

" i deserve it , " @entity65 said of the booing			0
" i mean , i 'm being honest			0
but is it fair ? no. you put an average guy in between those ropes , trust me , they wo n't even pull it back			0
" @entity65 had little sympathy from @entity77 , who suggested penalty strokes for slow players			1
what people do n't realize is that one shot is so valuable out here , " the @entity83 champion said after finishing tied for 40th , having closed with 73			0
@entity18 is one of the toughest courses on the circuit , and even leading players such as @entity92 struggle there			0
the @entity94 champion missed the halfway cut for the third time at the $ 9.5 million tournament , but retained the no. 1 ranking after @entity99 finished only sixth despite a closing 66			1
the @entity100 was two shots behind a group of four tied for second , including last weekend 's @entity105 winner @entity104 , @entity106 champion @entity104 , 2007 masters victor @entity104 and @entity108 's @entity107			0
but the spoils went to @entity1 , who claimed his first win since the @entity111 in 2010 and can now take his place among some legendary names to have triumphed at the @entity114			2
" i think one of the things that strikes me is walking every day through the champions ' tunnel , " he said			0
" every player does it			0
and for me , i ca n't help but stop and gaze at all the photos going through champions tunnel , and to think i 'm going to be a part of that with @entity126 and @entity127 and @entity128 and @entity129 and @entity130 and @entity77 , it 's all the best of the best			2
" to feel like i 'm going to see my picture up there next year is pretty cool			0
