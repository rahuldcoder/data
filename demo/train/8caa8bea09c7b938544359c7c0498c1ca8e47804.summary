@entity0 , @entity1 -- to look for @entity4 , you must be willing to travel a narrow , rutted and muddy road			1
and the more i bumped and backfired along it in my temperamental , rented , gas golf cart ... the deeper down the rabbit hole i fell			0
this is one weird story			0
some say it began a week ago friday when the man who practically invented internet security , @entity4 , shot his dogs			1
@entity4 ' frightened for his life ' others say it goes back to april when police raided his compound on the mainland looking for drugs and guns			1
they found both but the guns had permits and the drugs were legal			0
some say police never got over their disappointment			0
the @entity30 woman i had picked up with my golf cart told me @entity4 was trying to make a female version of @entity34			1
i 'm not in the habit of picking up hitchhikers but it 's customary here to give a lift to locals			2
as they say , " you never know when you might need a ride			0
" judging by the sound of my golf cart , that time was n't far off			0
@entity4 lives in the remote northern part of @entity0 , an island 36 miles from the @entity1 mainland			1
i hopped a 15 - minute prop - powered shuttle only to find his home was an additional six miles from the town of @entity51			2
you might wonder why someone with so much money would live so far from town down such a difficult road			2
rounding a sandy curve it quickly became obvious : the staggering beauty of the @entity60 coast			0
residents say the farther north on the island you go the higher the price of real estate			2
@entity4 's view is worth a fortune			1
an endless stretch of blue sky overhangs an ocean of pastel greens and blues framed by coconut palms			0
next to a long wooden dock with chairs at its end sits a fast - looking boat with twin outboards			2
i take a seat in @entity4 's front yard			1
under @entity1 law i 'm not trespassing since the beach is public property			1
behind me the wood - sided , thatch - roofed home painted purple and yellow sits eerily empty with one porch light on			2
a rusted telescope on a balcony stares off to the horizon			0
the only sound is the wind			0
the day before , i met " @entity94 " here			0
she claimed to be one of @entity4 's girlfriends , one of seven			1
they all live together , sharing @entity4 's houses and fantasies			1
@entity94 says she 's 23 and they have been lovers for three years			2
the girl beside her gives no name and only says she 's 19			2
@entity94 says she 's not seen or heard from @entity4 in nearly a week -- not since the neighbor , @entity107 , was discovered dead and @entity4 went into hiding			1
three arrested in killing in @entity1 now a day later the 23 - year - old had vanished too			1
half a dozen dogs lie sorry - looking or listless in the yard -- thin , hungry and thirsty			1
they 're lucky to be alive			0
dogs just might be the key to this mystery			2
officials say their barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between @entity4 and @entity107 , a 52 - year - old contractor who retired to @entity1 from @entity122 and lived next door			1
on november 9 , @entity4 told police someone poisoned four of his dogs			1
@entity94 said to put them out of their misery he shot each one in the head and buried them			0
then two days later someone shot @entity107 in the head in his own living room			0
a 9mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor , and @entity107 was found dead on the second floor			2
police say they only want to talk to the famous internet security guru			1
instead , @entity4 talks only to reporters			1
over a phone , he gives out all sorts of colorful quotes and tantalizing hints of his whereabouts , each contradicting the previous			0
he talks about moving every four hours and sleeping on a lice - infested bed , of watching " @entity150 " on an old tube tv , then claiming to be in a house not far from his compound , then no , actually he 's been in his compound the whole time , saying he does n't like the look of the traffic on the highway			1
this island has no highway			2
this almost daily " catch me if you can " game is wearing thin on investigators			0
the longer it all goes on , the more suspicious police become			0
police want to question @entity4 so five days ago they dug up his dogs			1
i found the partially exposed graves next to a trash pit in the back behind his priceless ocean view			0
the flies led me there			0
i asked a caretaker if he was here when the police came for them			0
" yes " he said , then added another tick up the strange - o - meter by revealing , " they cut off their heads			1
" since only the heads had bullets , the investigators put the rest of the remains back in the holes , then hurriedly and poorly recovered them			0
a source close to the investigation said authorities probably want to see if the slugs in the dogs match the one in @entity198			1
i stepped on the gas and my golf cart sputtered to life			0
like me , it seemed to dread the bone - jarring return to town			0
my phone beeped ; a local friend texted me to say @entity4 had just proclaimed a $ 25,000 - dollar ( just over 12,000 @entity207 dollars ) reward for information leading to the arrest of @entity107 's killer			1
a murdered neighbor , headless dogs and a millionaire on the run granting interviews and now offering a lottery - like reward			1
maybe someone could make up a more intriguing story ... but it would n't be easy .			0
