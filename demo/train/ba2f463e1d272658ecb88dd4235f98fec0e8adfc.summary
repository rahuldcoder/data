our everyday concerns -- what 's for dinner , what to update on @entity5 -- seem small when we consider that there 's a whole universe out there where other life may exist			0
astronomers now are upping that likelihood , announcing that they 've identified a star system with up to seven planets -- three of which could potentially host life -- 22 light - years away			1
the likelihood that conditions could support life on at least one of those planets , given that there are three terrestrial - mass planets in the habitable zone of one system , is " tremendous , " according to at least one scientist			1
the " habitable zone " is the area near a star in which a planet can theoretically hold liquid water			1
in our own solar system , @entity29 is close to the inner edge of potential habitability , while @entity33 is closer to the outer edge			2
the discovery is the largest number of " habitable zone " planets ever found within a single system , said @entity40 of the @entity41 , @entity42 , who led the team of astronomers			1
the findings were published wednesday in the journal @entity48			0
the findings are only the latest in a recent string of identifications of planets that may host life			2
" as soon as our telescopes and data analysis tools have become sophisticated enough to find them , habitable planets are popping up everywhere , " said @entity54 , professor of planetary science at @entity56 , who was not involved in the study			1
" it 's simply exhilarating to know that potentially habitable planets are ubiquitous			1
" what are these planets like ? the three planets orbit a star called @entity69 , part of the triple - star system @entity72			1
they are between four and eight times the mass of the @entity75 , making them " super-earths			0
" if you were standing on any of the potentially habitable planets in this system , that sun would appear as a bright red star			1
the other two stars in the system " would look like a very bright pair of stars providing as much illumination as the full moon on @entity75 , " @entity83 said			1
the planets are likely either rocky or water worlds , meaning they 're entirely covered in water			0
these particular planets also appear to be " tidally locked , " meaning the same side of a planet is always facing a star			1
that means one side of the planet always gets light and the other hemisphere is always in darkness			0
" with three terrestrial - mass planets in the habitable zone , the likelihood of one of them actually being habitable is tremendous , " @entity54 said			1
the system also likely consists of two hot planets further in and two cooler planets orbiting further out , although scientists are less certain that the seventh planet exists			2
scientists determined these characteristics of the star system using new observations gathered from the @entity116 and the @entity117 , with existing data from the @entity121 's @entity120 instrument in @entity122			1
before , scientists had determined that the star @entity69 had three planets with one that could be a candidate for life			1
the @entity69 star is about one - third the mass of our sun with about 2 % of its luminosity , meaning it is much fainter			1
but all three of the potentially habitable planets , and their neighbors in their solar system , lie within the equivalent of the orbit of @entity139 , meaning they are much closer to the host star than planets in our solar system			1
if they orbited our sun , the @entity69 planets ' surfaces evaporate and burn			1
but they may be habitable because their sun is so much smaller and dimmer			2
" it 's an extreme scaled down version of the solar system , " @entity83 said			0
another @entity75 called a certainty scientists said the findings suggest that stars with low mass such as @entity69 are the best targets for looking for planets that could host life			1
about 80 % of the stars in the @entity159 are in this category of low mass. it 's possible that there are many more of these systems that are packed with potentially habitable planets			1
how they compare to other habitable planets the @entity69 trio represents candidates for life that are about as good as three announced in april by scientists working with @entity175 's @entity174 satellite			1
@entity174 - 62e and @entity174 - 62f both orbit the same star , @entity174 - 62 , which is slightly cooler and smaller than our sun. @entity174 star , however , is 1,200 light - years away			0
these two planets are closer to the size of @entity75 than the third habitable candidate , @entity183			2
it 's less clearly in the habitable zone than the other two , and its sun is 2,700 light - years away from us			2
that makes @entity69 seem like a stone 's throw away by comparison , at 22 light years -- but that 's still about 129 trillion miles			2
in the night sky , the system can be found in the @entity195 constellation			0
the @entity174 satellite has been keeping an eye on more than 150,000 stars much further away , but on may 15 , @entity175 announced that a reaction wheel -- a part that helps aim the spacecraft -- stopped working			0
the most recent update , from june 7 , says the spacecraft is in @entity204 , after a second wheel was unable to preserve fuel for an eventual recovery effort			0
immediate safety is not as issue , and a team is going to manage the wheel recovery efforts			0
the kepler space telescope , launched in 2009 , allows scientists to measure changes in brightness of individual stars over time ; these dimming events signal that a planet is nearby			0
scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not passing rocks			0
" scientists undertake sophisticated calculations to verify that such signals are planets and not astrophysical phenomena mimicking the signature of a planet , " @entity83 said			0
by contrast , scientists who worked on the @entity69 system used the radial velocity method			1
with this , scientists look for wobbles in the motion of a star , which happens in response to the gravity of nearby planets			2
how about all of those other planets that have been found previously to be in the habitable zone ? you may recall planet @entity242 , which was announced in december 2011 and also was hailed as a potential candidate for hosting life			2
that planet had a radius 2.4 times that of @entity75 and is 600 light - years away			0
there is also a planet called @entity250 , discovered in september 2010 , which is thought to be even more like @entity75 than kepler - 22b in terms of its suitability for plants and animals			0
it 's only 20 light years from @entity75 , though there has been some controversy about its existence			0
in its solar system there is another planet , @entity264 - 581d , that is also of interest in the search for life , according to the @entity269 at the @entity270 at @entity271			0
the group 's catalog lists a few other candidates			0
but do they really have life ? because they are so far away , the composition of the atmospheres of all of these planets outside our solar system remains unknown			2
whether life truly roams or swims out there is still to be seen			0
" whether the planets are actually habitable would be pure speculation , " @entity54 said			2
" there 's currently no way to observe surface liquid water ( our habitability requirement ) or even infer the presence of surface liquid water			0
" still , @entity83 says the existence of star systems packed with potentially habitable planets , and the diversity of planets that @entity174 has found , suggest there are more exciting discoveries yet to come			1

star system has 3 potentially habitable planets
standing on one of them , the sun @entity69 would look like a bright red star
the @entity72 system has three stars in it
