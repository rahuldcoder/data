@entity0 -- if criminal suspects fail to invoke their right to remain silent , they have waived that right , a divided @entity2 ruled tuesday			1
the high court upheld the murder conviction of a man who did not verbally assert his right to remain silent during his police interrogation			1
in a 5 - 4 ruling , the court said a suspect must explicitly tell officers he or she is asserting that right , known as @entity17 rights			1
the famous constitutional " right to remain silent " and the " right to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions " are among the well - known warnings all criminal suspects must be given upon arrest			1
the conservative court has generally been supportive in recent years , when police challenges to @entity17 rights have been raised			2
" a suspect who has received and understood the @entity17 warnings , and has not invoked his @entity17 rights , waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to police , " said justice @entity27 , writing for the court			1
@entity35 was convicted of a january 10 , 2000 , murder outside a shopping mall in @entity38 , @entity39			1
he fled the scene , but was as arrested about a year later in @entity42			0
local police began what turned out to be a three - hour interrogation , with @entity46 at first forced to read aloud part of a copy of " constitutional rights " derived from the original @entity17 case that went before the @entity2 in 1966			2
the five rights included the warning " anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law , " and " the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent			1
" @entity46 refused to sign the form and there was strong disagreement over whether he verbally confirmed he understood them			0
he remained mostly silent during questioning , but later implicated himself in the shooting			0
he was later convicted of first - degree murder and other offenses			2
the court majority sided with the police 's version of the events			0
" @entity46 did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk to police , " @entity27 concluded			1
" had he made either of these simple , unambiguous statements , he would have invoked his ' right to cut off questioning			0
' here he did neither , so he did not invoke his right to remain silent			1
" @entity27 's views were supported by chief justice @entity76 , along with justices @entity77 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
a federal appeals court in @entity82 agreed with @entity46 his confession should be thrown out , but the high court reversed that decision			0
in a sharp dissent , justice @entity86 called the court 's ruling a " major retreat " from protections against self - incrimination guaranteed by the original @entity17 ruling			1
" criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent -- which counterintuitively requires them to speak , " she said			1
" at the same time , suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so			2
those results , in my view , find no basis in @entity17 or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair - trial principles on which those precedents are grounded			0
" @entity86 said the @entity46 ruling " turns @entity17 upside down			2
" justices @entity110 , @entity112 and @entity113 backed her conclusions			0
@entity46 had implicated himself after police asked if he believed in @entity116			0
after replying yes , officers then asked , " do you pray to @entity116 to forgive you for shooting that boy down ? " asking about victim @entity118			0
the court transcript said @entity46 replied " yes , " and turned away , but later refused to make a written confession			0
the case is @entity35 ( 08 - 1470 ) .			2

court : suspects who do *n't* explicitly invoke right to remain silent have waived it
@entity130 murder conviction in @entity39 case
in sharp dissent , @entity86 says ruling is a ' major retreat ' from self - incrimination protections
