@entity3 has been surfing these waters since he was in his 20s -- he 's now 59			1
not even the fact this beach is only 31 miles ( 50 kilometers ) south of the crippled @entity15 nuclear power plant deters him			1
" the radiation levels here are low , " he says			1
" the data says so , so all i can do is believe it			0

@entity90 moved here with his wife shortly after the disaster			0
all of their money was invested in their dream retirement home -- a house he doubts they will ever live in again			2
