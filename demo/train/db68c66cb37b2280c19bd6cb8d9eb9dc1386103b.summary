@entity0 -- a rare meeting of @entity4 heads of state , led for the first time by a @entity7 president , adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons thursday			1
president @entity11 is the first @entity7 leader to head a @entity0 @entity4 meeting			2
president @entity11 challenged the gathering -- which included leaders of nuclear powers including @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 -- to overcome cynicism against the goal of ridding the planet of nuclear arms			1
" we harbor no illusions about the difficulty of bringing about a world without nuclear weapons , " @entity11 said , adding that thursday 's meeting signaled a significant step forward in cooperative global action			1
the resolution , which was adopted unanimously , calls for tighter controls on nuclear materials to prevent them from being used for military purposes or stolen			1
it also encourages enforcement of international treaties and @entity0 resolutions regarding nuclear non-proliferation , particularly when nations such as @entity42 and @entity43 are in violation			0
" the world must stand together , " @entity11 said			2
" we must demonstrate that international law is not an empty promise			0
" it was the first @entity4 summit chaired by a @entity7 president , and only the fifth time that @entity4 heads of state have met			0
@entity11 led the meeting because the @entity7 holds the revolving presidency of the @entity4 in september			2
both @entity11 and @entity16 president @entity54 , who spoke later , said the world 's two nuclear superpowers were working on reducing their stockpiles in advance of a global nuclear summit scheduled for next year			1
" it 's obvious that an effective solution ... depends on the constructive engagement of all parties , " @entity54 said , adding that he expected the @entity16 - @entity7 leadership on the issue to be backed by " all nuclear powers			1
" the measure passed thursday -- @entity4 resolution 1887 -- calls for " locking down vulnerable nuclear weapons materials in four years " while minimizing civilian use of weapons - grade uranium			1
it encourages full compliance with all international treaties and resolutions on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , including @entity4 resolutions that cite @entity43 and @entity42 for failing to adhere to international commitments			0
in addition , the resolution supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy , a theme backed by @entity17 president @entity85			2
@entity17 seeks to expand its nuclear energy capacity as part of an economic development plan that holds down greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change			0
@entity92 prime minister @entity91 also cited the role of nuclear power as a clean energy source that should be part of the solution to global warming affecting every nation			0
@entity91 and other leaders spoke of the need to prevent nuclear weapons or the materials to make them from ending up in the hands of terrorist groups			1
" the biggest risk the world faces today is of extremists getting hold of nuclear materials , " said @entity105 , director general of the @entity106			0
@entity113 leader @entity112 , who criticized the @entity4 on wednesday in a rambling speech to the @entity115 , was absent for the meeting			2
in @entity113 's turn to speak at the summit , its special representative to the @entity0 called for the @entity106 to inspect all nuclear programs , including @entity122 's , instead of focusing on non-nuclear states			2
asked later about @entity112 's absence , @entity125 spokesman @entity124 said @entity113 could serve as an example to @entity42 and @entity43 as a nation that gave up its nuclear weapons program and now had rejoined the full international community			1
" i think the message that the @entity113 had at the @entity4 is a message that we hope that the @entity42 and the @entity43 will take to heart , and that is giving up a nuclear weapons program and the benefits that it can have for international cooperation and for their reintegration into an international community , " @entity124 said			1
@entity91 earlier called for sanctions against @entity42 for its efforts to develop a nuclear weapon			0
on wednesday , @entity54 signaled that @entity16 -- which previously has opposed such move -- also could support sanctions against @entity42			1
" @entity16 's position is clear : sanctions rarely lead to productive results , but in some cases sanctions are inevitable , " @entity54 said in a joint appearance with @entity11 after they met in @entity148			1
the statement bolsters @entity7 - led efforts for increased international pressure on @entity42 to adhere to nonproliferation agreements in pursuing the development of nuclear energy			0
@entity42 claims its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes , but the international community accuses it of continuing to try to develop nuclear weapons capability			1
the @entity42 mission to the @entity0 released a statement after the @entity4 meeting , saying the country 's nuclear activities " are and always have been , for peaceful purposes , and , therefore , pose no threat whatsoever			0
" " in practicing its legitimate right to develop nuclear energy technology , @entity42 has always maintained its need for nuclear power as an alternative source of energy to supply its booming population and rapid development			0
... our commitment to nonproliferation remains intact , " the statement added			0
the @entity7 and @entity16 previously have disagreed over @entity42 , and over possible steps the @entity4 may take -- including imposing sanctions -- to push @entity183 to comply with @entity0 demands concerning its nuclear program			2
last week , @entity11 announced that the @entity7 was dropping plans to base a missile defense shield system in @entity187 and the @entity188 , a proposal that had rankled @entity190			0
he has denied the change was directly linked to @entity16 's position regarding sanctions on @entity42 , but said any @entity16 shift in that direction would be a bonus .			0
