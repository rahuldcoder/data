-- on perhaps this year 's most compelling drama , the credits have yet to roll			0
many have described that drama -- a story , apparently directed by @entity6 , of @entity7 being hacked in retribution for a movie our foreign adversary considered an affront -- as novel			1
while this cyberattack is notable for how much it took place in public view , the offensive use of cyber-weapons is far from new			0
@entity7 is , in fact , just the latest victim in a recent , escalating spate of such attacks aimed at undermining our economic and national security interests			1
examples are numerous , and the damage to our economic and national interests has been severe			2
our financial institutions have been repeatedly targeted by criminal enterprises acting with impunity and at the direction of countries like @entity36 and @entity37 , according to news reports			1
our defense sector has seen a barrage of attacks aimed at siphoning off information that will undermine our nation 's security			2
reports have detailed a @entity48 hacking enterprise traceable to a single , government - run building in @entity50			1
and a @entity52 's indictment against five members of @entity48 's @entity54 reveals specifics of @entity48 's attempts to infiltrate and steal intellectual property from businesses in several industrial sectors			1
the theft of intellectual property through cyber-espionage has been called " the greatest transfer of wealth in history , " and cyber-crime and espionage reportedly cost the global economy $ 445 billion annually			0
recent reports have , moreover , confirmed that our nation 's energy grid is critically vulnerable			2
the @entity7 attack made headlines in part because it revealed @entity77 secrets and celebrity squabbles that were fodder for celebrity gossip and well - suited for tabloid spectacle			1
but that does n't make the damage any less serious			0
these ruthless cyberattacks damaged a company 's reputation , opened the door to uncertain legal liabilities , and made light of our nation 's copyright and intellectual property laws			0
they shattered any notion we may have had about our personal data and private communications remaining private			0
we should all be troubled by @entity7 's decision to entirely cancel the release of the film " @entity102 " in response to threats of physical violence by belligerent hackers			1
simply put : when decisions like this are made , @entity108 's enemies win			2
but make no mistake : our enemies are emboldened by this administration 's failure to develop and adequately resource a comprehensive cyber-strategy and respond decisively to increasingly sophisticated and motivated cyber-adversaries			1
@entity117 must pass meaningful cyber-legislation that allows our private sector and government to cooperate and share information that can be used to halt attacks before damage is done			1
we need , as a nation , to establish norms on what is permissible in cyberspace and ensure that law enforcement has the tools it needs to hold cyber-criminals , whether hacktivists or nation - states , accountable for their harm , when @entity117 returns in january , i will work to make cyber-security a top priority			2
if elected chairman of the @entity138 , i will establish a subcommittee focused on overseeing military cyber-programs , operations and activities			0
this is @entity77 's moment in the cyber-victim spotlight			0
the nation must transform these events into momentum to revise our strategy and improve our capabilities against such threats			0
our enemies will , no doubt , be watching .			0

@entity152 : @entity7 hack is only one recent example of escalating *cyber-attacks*
such attacks , some laid to @entity48 and @entity36 , threaten @entity108 interests , he says
he says the administration and @entity117 must develop a comprehensive cyber strategy
