-- nearly a decade after she was rescued from a remote @entity5 research station after diagnosing herself with breast cancer , dr. @entity3 died early tuesday , her brother said			1
@entity3 treated herself for breast cancer while stationed at the @entity8 in 1999			1
@entity10 had been fighting the latest round of cancer for the past five years , brother @entity9 said			1
she died just before 4 a.m. in @entity13 , surrounded by her family , he said			2
" she would want to be remembered for the adventure and , you know , living every day , and not just the sickness , " said sister - in - law @entity15			2
" she was very much active and still even doing talks as late as march of this year			2
then the last month or so , she was pretty sick			2
" @entity10 caught the nation 's attention in 1999 , when she found a lump in her breast as a 47 - year - old physician stationed at the @entity25			1
after finding the lump in june , she diagnosed herself with breast cancer and began treating herself using chemotherapy agents that the @entity28 parachuted to the station the next month			1
it was later revealed , according to a march 2009 article in the @entity33 newspaper , that @entity10 -- an emergency room doctor from @entity35 , @entity36 -- performed a biopsy on herself with the help of non-medical crew , who practiced using needles on a raw chicken			1
while treating herself , @entity10 carried on her duties as the sole doctor for the 41 - person research group			1
she consulted with her doctors in the @entity48 by e-mail and teleconference			2
they recommended that she return as soon as possible for treatment			2
although flights in support of the @entity8 program do n't usually begin until late october or early november , the start of @entity5 spring , it was october 6 when two planes set out on what was dubbed @entity60			1
ten days and a handful of stops later -- @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and then @entity5 -- rescuers braved temperatures of nearly minus 60 degrees @entity69 to land a ski - equipped plane at the pole , drop off a replacement doctor and pick up @entity10			1
it was the earliest such flight attempted			2
once she returned home and was treated , @entity10 's cancer went into remission , and she wrote about her experience in a best - selling book , " @entity80			1
" she married and became a public speaker , @entity15 said			2
but in 2005 , @entity10 's cancer returned in her bones and liver , later spreading to her brain			1
" my experience at the pole had to do with accepting things that most people fear most deeply and coming to feel that they need not be feared , " @entity10 told @entity86 magazine in 2006			1
" it certainly had far more to do with peace and surrender than it did with courage			2
being ' on the ice ' was a great good fortune : it created a much greater clarity for me about what was essential in life			0
" i 'm not afraid of death			0
i 've come to accept it as being part of life , and i think i 've come to accept it earlier than my years because of what 's happened to me			1
" she said that after learning her cancer had returned , " after about three weeks of going through a kind of terror , i felt the most incredible peace come over me			1
now i am very happy and excited about going forward with my life			0
the metastatic disease is now just another part of me , another thing that has happened to me			0
" " she was always upbeat , " @entity15 said			0
" she never really dwelled upon her illness			0
she told people to live every day , and it was about what kind of life you lived			0
she was really inspirational to a lot of people around the world			0
" in october 2008 , @entity10 spoke at the @entity126 , formerly her alma mater the @entity126 , according to the @entity33			1
she took off her wig to show students her bald head , the newspaper said , and told them not to be discouraged : " there is no end of life until your last breath			0
we can all do something to help someone			0
" she told the @entity33 in march that the cancer had spread to her brain but still displayed her inspiring grit			1
" i 'm not as smart a girl as i used to be , " she told the newspaper			0
" i 'm not as hard a worker , that 's for sure			0
but i 'm still doing everything , i 'm writing a book and giving speeches , and i 'm really having a beautiful winter			1
" @entity10 told @entity86 , " the things that make you strong , and make you feel as though you 've accomplished something , are not the easy ones ; it 's the things you had to work and struggle through			1
those are what give us our depth -- that make us not gray and plain and nothing but give us depth and texture and longing			0
" i believe you 're always much better off knowing what the real truth is			0
i think it 's only then that you can come to grips with your illness , or with any difficult situation			0
some people call this process ' mourning			0
' i prefer to call it tiring of the fear and the depression and the denial , and the fake optimism and the irritation of it all -- and just saying , ' hey , i 'm tired of feeling bad about this			0
' " @entity0 's @entity184 contributed to this report .			0
