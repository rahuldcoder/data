-- the great @entity2 graphic designer @entity1 once declared , " there are three responses to a piece of design — yes , no , and wow ! wow is the one to aim for			1
" @entity8 and @entity9 apparently endorse that notion			1
the fashion mogul and his wife have planted their flag on a glorious stretch of beachfront just north of @entity16 with a home defined by spectacular moments , whimsical flourishes , and astonishing coups de théâtre			0
in this case wow ! might be an understatement			0
" we 're here for the weather , the @entity27 flavor , the art , and the palm trees			0
most of all we 're here for the fun , " says @entity30			0
the residence also provides a base near his latest business venture			0
@entity9 , who sold his fashion label several years ago but remains its principal designer , recently purchased the @entity39 hotel in @entity40 , and he plans to refurbish the @entity42 gem starting in 2015			2
but first he and @entity43 had their own renovation project to tackle			0
the house they settled on was a 2007 modern structure , offering some 14,000 square feet			1
size was crucial , as the couple coveted space for works from their extensive art collection that had long been held in storage			2
@entity0 : @entity58 's @entity57 @entity56 home " our @entity60 home feels very country , with lots of taxidermy , and our place in @entity66 has a more @entity68 vibe			2
we wanted to be able to showcase the colorful large - scale artworks that did n't make sense elsewhere , conceptually or size-wise , " @entity43 explains , referring to their trove of @entity71 and @entity73 treasures by @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , and others			2
to realize the energetic , art - friendly abode they imagined , the couple turned to @entity86 interior designer @entity85			1
having admired his facility with bold gestures and integrating major art into domestic settings — specifically , his work at the @entity86 residence of @entity93 and @entity94 — the @entity95 enlisted @entity85 to help conjure a home attuned to the rhythms and colors of @entity16			1
@entity0 : a @entity99 in @entity100 " @entity8 and @entity43 obviously have an incredible sense of fashion , so my job was to translate their vision into interior spaces that feel vibrant and compelling , " says @entity85			1
" together , we conceived the house as part art gallery and part 1960s -- ' 70s disco madness			1
" the designer started by replacing ubiquitous dark - wood paneling and expanses of travertine with clean white walls and new flooring of white - glass tiles to cultivate a pristine aura			2
for graphic contrast he reclad the central staircase in black marble — a strategy reiterated in the black and white stripes on the kitchen floor			0
once the backdrop was set , it was off to the races			0
@entity0 : @entity130 's @entity129 " i told @entity85 , ' if it 's not shagadelic or groovy , it 's not coming into the house , ' " @entity43 recounts , describing her criteria for furniture and finishes			1
true to form , @entity85 obliged with a kaleidoscopic array of colors , materials , and furnishings , all deployed in vignettes that scream glamour and sex appeal			0
the heart of the home is the voluminous living room , presided over by a monumental collaborative painting by @entity74 and @entity75			0
ignoring stale precepts that dictate the isolation of art from decor , @entity85 extrapolated the painting 's vivid hues in an orgiastic hair - on - hide carpet featuring lavish swirls			1
he also commissioned reeditions of classic sofas by @entity158 and side tables by @entity160 to inhabit the space			0

' if it 's not shagadelic or groovy , it 's not coming into the house '
@entity8 and @entity9 aim for a ' wow ' factor in their @entity173 residence
pop and @entity176 treasures adorn the couple 's 14,000 square - foot home
designer @entity85 planned ' part art gallery and part 1960s -- ' 70s disco madness '
