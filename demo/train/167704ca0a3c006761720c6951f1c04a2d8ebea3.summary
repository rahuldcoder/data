@entity0 -- a free speech dispute over a @entity4 law banning sale of violent video games to children will go to the @entity8 for review			1
the justices monday accepted the state 's appeal and will decide whether the law is too restrictive in denying access by minors to often - graphic material			2
video - game makers say the ban goes too far			1
they say the existing nationwide , industry - imposed , voluntary ratings system is an adequate screen for parents to judge the appropriateness of computer games			1
the state says it has a legal obligation to protect children when the industry has failed to do so			1
at issue is how far constitutional protections of free speech and expression , as well as due process , can be applied to youngsters			0
critics of the law say the government would in effect be engaged in the censorship business , using " community standards " to evaluate artistic and commercial content			0
oral arguments will be held in the fall			0
a federal appeals court in @entity45 , @entity4 , tossed out the law before it took effect , after gov. @entity49 signed it in 2005			2
he applauded the high court 's decision to intervene			0
" we have a responsibility to our kids and our communities to protect against the effects of games that depict ultraviolent actions , just as we already do with movies , " the governor said			2
the legislation was designed to strengthen the current rating system , and would have placed an outright ban on the sale or rental to those under 18 of games deemed excessively violent			2
as defined by @entity4 , such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of " killing , maiming , dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being " in offensive ways			1
retailers could be fined up to $ 1,000 for any violation			0
the gaming industry sued in federal court and won an injunction halting enforcement of the law until the courts sort out the constitutional questions			2
in a written statement , @entity84 , president of the @entity85 , said he is hopeful his industry will prevail and " the court will reject @entity4 's invitation to break from these settled principles by treating depictions of violence , especially those in creative works , as unprotected by the @entity95			1
" the motion picture industry has its own self - monitoring ratings system , imposed decades ago after complaints that some films were too explicit for general audiences in what was seen and heard			1
the gaming industry says its ratings system roughly follows the same self - imposed guidelines , and ratings are clearly labeled on the packaging			1
the state argued it was responding to parents ' complaints that too much violent material -- including gruesome battles to the death between on - screen competitors and adversaries -- was being viewed and played by minors			2
officials claimed the current ratings system is not adequate in filtering out the controversial content , and that underage teens have been able to buy " m - rated " games designed only for mature , or adult , players			1
lawmakers also said there is a " causal connection " between access to such games and psychological or other harm to children			0
in their petition to the high court , state lawyers cited studies showing children who repeatedly watch on - screen games can become more aggressive , antisocial , and less able to distinguish the consequences of violence in real life			0
similar efforts in other states to restrict gaming content have been rejected by various courts			0
the @entity8 in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography , saying legislation went too far in limiting adult access to explicit , but lawful , sexual content on the internet			1
and the justices last week threw out a federal law limiting the sale of graphic videos of animal cruelty			0
the court has also said in a variety of contexts that minors enjoy a variety of free - expression rights			0
the case is @entity49 v. @entity163 ( 08 - 1448 ) .			0
