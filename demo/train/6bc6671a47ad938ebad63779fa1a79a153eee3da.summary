-- street art has forever been a vibrant tool of personal expression manifesting in a variety of unique ways			1
in @entity7 it comes in the form of beautifully painted shop fronts , alternative methods of political campaigning and striking murals designed to inspire			1
to celebrate the best of @entity16 street art , @entity13 asked for your submissions of the beautiful , political , or just plain fun			1
back in the 1970s it was a gritty subculture associated with the streets of @entity22 , but these days the underground art of spray can graffiti can be found around the world , and @entity7 is no exception			1
@entity30 rapper @entity28 submitted some of his work to @entity13 from around the capital city of @entity34			2
for him , being a street artist -- in addition to his musical exploits -- helps him share his voice with the local community " this wall is working as a sketchbook ... street is a space that i feel people can learn , and people can meet art and so that 's what motivates me , " he said			1
watch : rapper turns to street artist " i love doing graffiti because i think that 's something straight related with me			1
i got love for the streets			0
i got love for spray cans			0
" the legitimacy of graffiti has been an ongoing discourse in developed nations for several years thanks to the rise in popularity of anonymous guerrilla artists like @entity65 and @entity66			2
similarly to shot b , striking work by @entity16 graffiti artist @entity69 can be found on walls in and around @entity72			1
much of his work incorporates the design quirks of the building he is working on , to the effect that it often seems to have evolved with the building itself			0
" i 've been a graffiti artist with a strong traditional @entity84 influence since 1988 , " he said to @entity13			2
" i do n't really consider myself a street artist but a graffiti artist / writer who dabbles in ' street art '			1
" many rappers like @entity28 and @entity69 use graffiti as an extension of their @entity84 - inspired expression			2
but street art is also providing others with a political voice			1
while traveling through @entity96 , @entity95 stumbled across a series of partisan murals			2
intrigued by the designs , @entity95 reached out to @entity96 colleagues who informed her that each local party is given public wall space to present campaign pledges , usually through election posters			2
" some parties have iconic symbols that represent them , so instead of posters , they use spray paint and stencils to paint the image of their party 's symbol on the wall , " she explained			0
she added : " it 's a much simpler , yet less wasteful , greener way to distribute campaign information			0
the wall also enables parties to interact with the illiterate members of the population			0
" i can appreciate the value in having a symbol representing a party so someone who can not read can simply pick out the identical symbol on the ballot in order to cast their vote -- makes the voting process a more accessible one			0
" meanwhile in @entity136 , local communities are using street art as a way of presenting their culture			1
@entity140 , an ireporter from @entity141 , captured a remarkable mural on a school @entity144 ade in @entity145			0
created by his friend @entity147 , the mural is part of a larger body of work from the @entity152 project , which aims to bring resident artists together to celebrate the @entity136 communities while encouraging tourism in the region			0
" i believe that the culture of @entity7 inspire artists of all the times , " he said			2
" @entity160 and @entity161 are some examples of @entity16 influence in the art world			1
" in @entity166 , @entity165 captured a stunning mural on the side of the @entity170 offices , a brand advertising college in @entity172 , @entity166			0
created by local artist @entity174 , the piece was commissioned by the college in the hopes of inspiring students by featuring several @entity166 personalities including musician and rights activist @entity180			1
" i like the fact that the artwork was done on the first floor of the building and the outer fence , " he said			0
" together it told a story of liberation of the mind , of freedom , of standing for what you love and succeeding			0
" @entity0 's @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
