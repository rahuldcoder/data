@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity8 planned in 2009 to replace a section of its gas pipeline just a couple of miles from the section that exploded last week in @entity0 , @entity1 , but never spent the $ 5 million of rate increases to do the work , a consumer watchdog group said wednesday			1
and further , said @entity12 [ @entity13 ] , the utility asked for another $ 5 million for the same project in 2009 -- the year it should have completed the work it has n't even started -- saying it would n't be completed until 2013			1
" the money was spent on what they call higher priority work , " said turn senior attorney @entity15			2
" you ca n't track the dollars one by one , but we do know they spent $ 62 million more on management incentive business than they had forecast in 2009 , " he said			1
" they spent $ 60 million on going back and re-doing gas leak surveys that they had botched elsewhere on their system			1
" @entity8 responded that it " is committed to performing the work necessary to assure the safety of its gas transmission system			1
" the utility said it had identified the line section as a " high priority project " in the earlier transmission rate filing , but " rescheduled the project " after an updated assessment in 2009			1
but the company did not explain why it needed an additional $ 5 million and three years to complete repairs on a section it said in its most recent rate filing was in the top 100 risks for failure			1
" coupled with the consequences of failure of this section of pipeline , the likelihood of a failure makes the risk of a failure at this location unacceptably high , " the company said in that filing			2
@entity12 officials think they know where some of the money went -- in 2009 , the year @entity8 did n't spend $ 5 million on fixing the pipeline , the company did spend $ 5 million on bonuses for six top executives			1
" the company 's priorities appear to be skewed , " turn executive director @entity65 said			2
the line that exploded in @entity0 was laid down in 1948 , as was the section @entity8 was supposed to replace			1
in the first filing , the utility noted that the " vintage 30 - inch pipeline " runs through " several high consequence areas			2
" in the second , it said the pipeline was " located in a heavily urbanized area			2
" four people were killed in thursday 's explosion and fire in the @entity82 suburb , and three are still missing			0
the blast blew in the doors of a grocery store a quarter - mile ( 400 meters ) away , and the explosion and resulting fire injured 52 people and destroyed 37 homes			0
the explosion blew a 28 - foot section of the pipeline 100 feet in the air			0
in the filing documents -- provided by @entity12 -- the section of pipe to be replaced is identified as in the top 100 for highest risks of failure			0
and since exact locations of pipelines are generally kept secret because of terrorism threats , residents may not even know they live near one until it 's too late			0
" if they fixed that section that they said wanted to fix maybe they would have found something that led them to look a mile or two south of there , " @entity15 said			0
" we do n't know that			0
we do know that the project was slated for 2009			0
it did n't get done			0
now they 're proposing to do it again in 2013			0
" the @entity115 has not made a decision on this latest increase request			0
@entity8 has agreed to set up a $ 100 million fund to help rebuild parts of @entity0 .			1

@entity8 got $ 5 million to replace pipeline in 2009
@entity123 now requesting another $ 5 million to make repairs it did n't make then
@entity8 says it 's " committed " to " the safety of its gas transmission system "
watchdog group says @entity8 spent $ 5 million in bonuses in 2009
