-- " viewers do n't want to be informed			2
viewers want to feel informed			2
" those are the words of @entity4 , one of the founders of @entity6 , as quoted in @entity8 's new biography of @entity9 , the network 's chief			1
@entity11 apparently accomplished : @entity6 is the most - watched cable news network , and yet , some surveys suggest that people who rely on @entity6 as their primary information source know less about current events than people who watch no news at all			1
but to jab at @entity6 for inaccuracy is to miss @entity6 's purpose			1
@entity6 has created an information community			1
we used to say , " everybody 's entitled to his own opinion , but not his own facts			2
" in a mass media age , what counted as " fact " was defined by a few great national institutions : a small group of prestigious newspapers , a pair of leading news magazines , a trio of television broadcasters			0
dissenters had a difficult time reaching any kind of large audience -- or even identifying who their audience might be			2
advancing technology opened new possibilities , and @entity8 's biography deftly tells the story of how it happened			1
the launch of @entity1 inspired @entity48 to create a cable news channel of its own , @entity50			0
@entity9 -- a former tv producer who had emerged as the most successful @entity52 campaign consultant of the 1980s -- was hired to run @entity50			1
after he lost an internal power struggle , @entity9 joined @entity55 's @entity54			1
and the rest , as they say , is history			0
before @entity6 , news programmers had struggled with the question of what their product was			1
did it include health information , and if so , how much ? weather ? financial information ? human interest ? political opinion ? @entity9 built his new channel upon a very different question : who is my product for ? the largest generation in @entity75 history , the baby boomers , were reaching deep middle age by the mid- 1990s			1
they were beginning to share an experience familiar to all who pass age 50 : living in a country very different from the one they had been born into			0
@entity6 offered them a new virtual environment in which they could feel more at home than they did in the outside world			1
@entity6 was carefully designed to look like a tv show from the 1970s : no holograms , no urban hipster studios , lots of primary colors			1
in other respects too , @entity54 offered a path back to a vanishing past			1
here was a place in which men were firmly in charge , and in which women were valued most for their physical attractiveness			0
here was a place in which ethnic minorities appeared only in secondary roles -- and then , with brave exceptions , only to affirm the rightness of the opinions of the white males in the primary roles			0
back in the 1970s , students of public opinion had noticed a strange anomaly : in the very years , 1967 - 1973 , when trust in government , business , the military and organized religion most sharply declined , trust in television rose			0
some speculated that tv as an institution had an inherently adversarial relationship to other institutions : @entity121 enhanced its own credibility by denigrating the credibility of everything and everyone that was n't tv			0
that theory was coded into the dna of @entity6			1
here , on this station , the chosen market segment could enjoy security and validation			0
out there was depicted a hostile world of threats , danger , crime , and decaying values			0
in the nearly two decades since the launch of @entity6 , the average age of the viewers has increased -- and so has their alienation from a country that twice elected @entity147 to the presidency			1
economic prospects have narrowed and darkened for middle - income people			0
first the stock market , then the housing market , then the gold market bubbled and burst -- taking the savings of the unwary with them			0
americans in their 60s have reason to worry about the stability of @entity161 and @entity162			0
new claims on government assistance -- unemployment insurance , health care spending on under - 65s -- can be seen as drains on resources that would otherwise flow to the over- 65s			0
the question famously associated with @entity6 ' @entity176 , " who 's looking out for you ? " resonates especially powerfully in the ears of the economically anxious elderly in a rapidly changing country			1
@entity8 tells eyebrow - raising stories about @entity9			2
always a man who kept enemies ' lists , @entity9 has -- in @entity8 's account -- succumbed to increasing apprehension as he has gained increasing power			1
his office is secured with a double set of locked and coded doors			0
his country home features a panic room			0
former employees report being followed and suspect their e-mail has been read			0
the anxiety that permeates @entity6 ' broadcasts emanates authentically from the man at the top			2
yet it speaks also to something pervasive in @entity6 's audience too			1
like talk radio before it , but even more intensely , @entity6 offered information programmed not as a stream of randomly connected facts , but as a means of self - definition and a refuge from a hostile external reality			1
@entity6 is a news medium that functions as a social medium			2
how this new kind of tv news was built , and at what price , is the story painstakingly narrated by @entity8 in his indispensable book			0
what to think of this new kind of information entity is up to you			2
you 'll have to decide			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 : @entity6 's @entity9 created an information community for a specific *demographic*
he says @entity54 appeals to an older audience concerned about direction of change in @entity75
he says new biography of @entity9 shows an anxious network and an anxious audience
