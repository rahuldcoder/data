-- @entity1 gave @entity0 an advance preview of four songs from her upcoming album " @entity5 " an hour before the first show of the final leg of her @entity8 in @entity10			1
though @entity1 's people were quick to point out that these were not the final mixes , the tracks certainly sounded like polished , finished recordings			1
here 's a track - by - track rundown of what we heard backstage , as well as what she played from the new record in concert			0
" @entity22 " currently scheduled as the second single from the album , " @entity22 " is a classic @entity1 pop banger with three huge hooks , a thumping house music breakdown and a vocal part that borrows a bit of @entity31 's distinctive cadence			1
@entity1 has written about falling for the wrong guy before in " lovegame " and " @entity34 , " but this time around she 's a bit less dark and dramatic			1
there 's a bubbly sweetness in her voice as she sings " i 'm just a horny fool / baby it 's so cool / i 'm still in love with @entity22 , baby			1
" " @entity42 " this one sounds crazy in print -- it 's a massive power ballad with heavy club beats that features @entity47 of the @entity48 wailing on his saxophone ( @entity47 also plays on " hair " ) -- but somehow it all seems totally natural when you actually hear it			1
there 's an element of cheesiness to it , but it 's totally captivating and incredibly catchy			0
if any of these new @entity1 tunes demands to be a big fat hit , this is it			2
the inclusion of @entity47 is an inspired touch that amplifies the song 's @entity64 stadium rock vibe , but his actual performance is amazing and ranks among the best of his career			0

the album version does n't have the same hardcore @entity78 house flavor , but it 's definitely the tune most likely to bring back memories of early - @entity81 dance crossover hits by @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			2
the opening of the song -- in which she flatly intones " i do n't speak @entity88 , but i can if you like " -- is fierce , but the song is saved from being a slight novelty by a soaring chorus that vaguely recalls @entity94 's " @entity93			0
" photos : @entity1 at the 2011 @entity96 " hair " " hair " is another inspirational song in the mold of " @entity5 , " but it 's a bit weirder , mixing the yearning romantic melodrama of @entity104 's " @entity103 " with the hard industrial metal edge of @entity106			1
the lyrics are essentially about embracing one 's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity , climaxing with @entity1 triumphantly declaring " i am my hair ! " in its huge sing along chorus			1
an anthem for hair salons everywhere			0
photos : @entity1 's @entity119 " @entity120 " @entity1 did n't share the studio version of this theatrical rock ballad , but she did perform it in her concert later in the evening			1
this one has been part of her @entity8 setlist for months now , and at this point it 's already a crowd - pleasing showstopper			0
assuming that the album recording will have more or less the same piano - centric arrangement , " @entity120 " will provide a necessary break from the high energy beats on the other tracks			2
watch her performance of the song from " @entity137 " back in july below			0
" @entity5 " this is the @entity139 single in the country , so you 've probably heard this one by now			0
this was the first time @entity1 has played the song in concert , but it 's already the ideal conclusion to her show , ending the night with a giddy communal celebration of personal empowerment and self - acceptance			2
