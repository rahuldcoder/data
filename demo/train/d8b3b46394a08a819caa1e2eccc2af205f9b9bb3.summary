-- when @entity2 awakened , she was already in the recovery room			2
@entity5 authorities had dragged her out of her home and down four flights of stairs , she said , restraining and beating her husband as he tried to come to her aid			1
they whisked her into a clinic , held her down on a bed and forced her to undergo an abortion			2
her offense ? becoming pregnant with a second child , in violation of @entity5 's one - child policy			1
" after the abortion , i felt empty , as if something was scooped out of me , " @entity2 told a congressional panel in september			2
" my husband and i had been so excited for our new baby			0
now suddenly all that hope and joy and excitement disappeared			0
... i was very depressed and despondent			0
for a long time , whenever i thought about my lost child , i would cry			2
" as she lay unconscious , she said , an iud to prevent future pregnancies was inserted			0
the issue of forced abortions -- and in some cases , forced sterilizations -- in @entity5 has seized the spotlight in recent days with news of escaped activist @entity37			1
@entity37 , a blind , self - taught lawyer , rose to fame in the late 1990s because of his advocacy for what he calls victims of abusive practices , such as forced abortions , by @entity5 family planning officials			1
he investigated forced abortions and sterilizations in eastern @entity5 -- a practice @entity5 denies -- and helped organize a class - action lawsuit on behalf of victims , for which he served four years in prison			1
a fellow activist , @entity50 , said @entity37 has taken refuge at the @entity52 in @entity53			1
" @entity37 may be safe for the moment , but the women for whom he risked everything are not , " said @entity54 , president of @entity55 , a @entity56 - based organization that describes itself as a " broad - based , international coalition that opposes forced abortion and sexual slavery in @entity5			1
" " forced abortion is not a choice , " @entity63 said			2
" it is official government rape			0
" on a january 2011 visit to the @entity70 , @entity5 president @entity68 reportedly denied that @entity5 was forcing women to submit to abortions			1
rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , who gave @entity50 a list of human rights concerns , said that @entity50 insisted a forced - abortion policy did not exist , according to media reports			1
@entity5 's population is the largest on earth , with more than 1.34 billion people			1
since its implementation in 1979 , the one - child policy has prevented more than 400 million births in @entity5 , according to @entity5 's @entity85			1
about 13 million abortions are performed nationwide each year , the commission has said -- about 35,000 a day			2
it is unknown how many of those are coerced			0
but the one - child policy has been blamed for abuses			1
in some cases , advocates say , fetuses identified as female are aborted , or midwives strangle a female infant with the umbilical cord during delivery , identifying the baby as " stillborn , " according to all girls allowed , a nonprofit group that aims to end female " gendercide , " educate abandoned girls , rescue trafficked children and defend women 's reproductive rights			1
other females are abandoned , left to die or raised as orphans			0
@entity5 traditionally prefer boys over girls because they are seen as better able to provide for the family and carry on the family bloodline			1
as a result , the practice of aborting female fetuses or abandoning infant girls continues , particularly in rural areas			0
in november , according to state - run news agency @entity122 , premier @entity123 , in a speech to the @entity125 on @entity126 , " urged banning illegal fetus gender identification and illegal abortion			2
" " the social status of the female population indicates the level of social progress ( of a nation ) , while children are the future and hope of a nationality and a nation , " @entity123 said			0
last summer , @entity122 reported that " millions of @entity5 men of marrying age may be living as frustrated bachelors by 2020 " because of the gender imbalance			1
in 2010 , @entity5 's sex ratio at birth was 118 boys for every 100 girls , the news agency said			1
@entity5 kicked off a national campaign " to significantly curb non-medical sex determinations and sex - selective abortions to balance the gender ratio , " @entity122 said			1
also during the campaign , " efforts will be made to raise awareness of gender equality , to severely punish those involved in cases of non-medical sex determinations and sex - selective abortions , and to strengthen monitoring			1
" @entity157 , vice minister of the @entity158 , said that doctors violating the ban would be stripped of their licenses or penalized , and involved medical institutions would also be punished , according to @entity122			0
the one - child policy could contribute to @entity5 's high rate of female suicide , according to all girls allowed			1
@entity5 is the only country in the world where the female suicide rate is higher than that of men -- some 500 women a day , the group said , citing statistics from the @entity174 and the @entity175			1
in its 2009 @entity181 , the @entity175 noted that " many observers believed that violence against women and girls , discrimination in education and employment , the traditional preference for male children , birth - limitation policies , and other societal factors contributed to the high female suicide rate			1
women in rural areas , where the suicide rate for women was three to four times higher than for men , were especially vulnerable			2
" sometimes the consequences are even more severe			2
in october 2011 , a woman who was six months pregnant died during a forced abortion in eastern @entity5 , according to @entity55			1
last month , a woman in the same region was forced to undergo an abortion while nine months pregnant , the organization reported			2
the baby was born alive , but then was drowned in a bucket , according to the organization			0
a photo of the infant 's body floating in the bucket was circulated on @entity207 , the @entity5 version of @entity208 , sparking widespread outrage			1
@entity5 officials are prohibited under law from " infringing on the rights and interests of citizens when promoting compliance with population planning policies , " according to the @entity217 , created by @entity218 to monitor human rights and the rule of law in @entity5			1
however , the commission in its most recent annual report noted " reports of official campaigns , as well as numerous individual cases in which officials used violent methods to coerce citizens to undergo sterilizations or abortions or pay heavy fines for having ' out - of - plan ' children , " meaning a family 's second child			1
in one example from october 2010 , the commission said , a woman in southeastern @entity5 who was eight months pregnant with her second child was kidnapped and detained for 40 hours			1
she was forcibly injected with a substance that caused the fetus to abort			0
her husband reportedly was not permitted to see her during this time , the commission said			0
" nothing in human history compares to the magnitude of @entity5 's 33 - year assault on women and children , " said rep. @entity241 , @entity242 and chairman of the commission , during the september hearing at which @entity2 testified			1
" today in @entity5 , rather than being given maternal care , pregnant women without birth - allowed permits are hunted down and forcibly aborted			1
... for over three decades , brothers and sisters have been illegal ; a mother has absolutely no right to protect her unborn baby from state - sponsored violence			2
" " out of plan " children whose parents do not pay fines may go without household registration , or hukou , which presents obstacles to social benefits including subsidized health care and public education , @entity260 said , citing the commission 's 2010 report			2
a woman 's family members , including her husband , parents , in - laws or siblings , may also be targeted for violations of the policy , according to @entity282 , which published a 2005 report compiled from @entity37 's notes into cases he was investigating before his arrest			1
the report alleges arrest , torture , beatings and fines of family members for the violations of relatives			0
it also documents a case where a woman suffered health problems after being forced to undergo a tubal ligation despite her high blood pressure			2
@entity2 told lawmakers her first forced abortion was in 2003 , after officials said she and her husband would be fined $ 31,000 for their second child and fired from their jobs			1
her second came in 2006 , despite the fact she and her husband at that time were willing to pay the fine and lose their jobs			0
she continues to suffer consequences from the abortions			2
her husband divorced her , she said , because she could not give him a son ( the couple already had a daughter )			0
after she remarried and moved to the @entity70 in 2010 , she said , she visited a clinic to have her @entity317 removed and undergo an exam			0
" the doctor told me that i had cervical erosion , likely due to the poor medical conditions of my forced abortions , " she said			1
@entity323 told a similar story to @entity218 last year			0
she said after giving birth to her son , she was required to undergo five abortions between 1983 and 1990			2
during the last procedure , an iud was inserted			0
" when i learned of the procedure , i protested that i had a kidney disease and could not keep the @entity317 , but they completely ignored me , " she said			0
" the doctor just gave the bill to my husband and told him to pay			0
" her husband was later arrested , she said , and she was given a " serious administrative warning " at her job and fined six months ' pay			0
@entity157 had to report to the factory clinic each month for an exam to make sure she had not removed the @entity317 on her own or become pregnant again , she said			0
in 1997 , she missed a monthly pregnancy check because she was caring for her terminally ill mother , she testified			0
" agents from the @entity85 waited at my home to drag me to the exam , " she said			0
" when they pushed me to the ground , i fell and hurt my neck vertebrae			0
my spirit completely collapsed after this one			0
i attempted suicide , but was stopped by my family from jumping			0
" @entity157 was able to move to the @entity70 and she and her husband reconciled after a divorce			0
" i feel happiness and joyful , " she told lawmakers			0
" but i know in my homeland , @entity5 , there are millions of women who are suffering as i did			1
each day thousands of young lives are being destroyed			0
i beg everyone to save them			0
