in the days since @entity1 was shot and killed , protests have filled the streets in @entity3			1
but beyond the signs , marchers and tear gas , there 's the pain and grief of a family			2
it 's a pain @entity12 knows all too well			2
" i wish i had a word of automatic comfort , but i do n't , " she writes in an open letter to @entity1 's parents			1
she , too , lost a son in a shooting death that also triggered protests and outrage			0
" i hate that you and your family must join this exclusive yet growing group of parents and relatives who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence , " she writes in the letter published in @entity26			1
" but @entity1 is much more than a police / gun violence case ; @entity1 is your son			1
" two and a half years ago on february 27 , 2012 , @entity17 's son was shot and killed in @entity36 by @entity37 , a volunteer neighborhood watch captain			1
the case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges			0
president @entity41 publicly addressed the case , as he has in the @entity1 shooting			1
and as is the case with the @entity1 shooting , protests in support of @entity24 and his family spread nationwide			1
@entity37 was charged on april 11 , 2012			0
then in july of 2013 , he was found not guilty of second degree murder			0
in the @entity1 shooting , a grand jury may begin to hear testimony as early as wednesday and decide on whether to return an indictment against the police officer who killed him , @entity51			1
claims of character assassination meanwhile , key questions in the case remain unanswered and a debate over what we do know plays out in public			2
police have released video of @entity1 taking part in an alleged convenience store robbery , and a purported friend of the @entity51 called into a local radio station claiming that @entity1 attacked the officer and disobeyed an order to freeze			2
it 's an account that a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation later told @entity73 matches what @entity51 himself has told investigators			0
however , both the video and the account of events contrast sharply with what witnesses and family members have said about the incident and @entity1 's character			1
perhaps in reference to this public debate , @entity17 writes the @entity89 will " hear character assassinations about @entity1 which i am certain you already have			1
" she adds , " this will incense and insult you			0
all of this will happen before and continue long after you have had the chance to lay your son to rest			0
" " honor your son and his life , not the circumstances of his alleged transgression , " @entity17 writes			1
" i have always said that @entity24 was not perfect			0
but no one will ever convince me that my son deserved to be stalked and murdered			0
no one can convince you that @entity1 deserved to be executed			2
" @entity17 pledges that " neither of their lives shall be in vain " and ends her letter with a fiery call to action			1
" if they refuse to hear us , we will make them feel us			2
" " some will mistake that last statement as being negatively provocative			0
but feeling us means feeling our pain ; imagining our plight as parents of slain children			0
we will no longer be ignored			0
" magazine : the aftermath in @entity3 complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity3			0

" i wish i had a word of automatic comfort , but i do n't , " she writes
@entity17 writes the @entity89 will " hear character assassinations about @entity1 "
she ends the letter with a fiery call to action
