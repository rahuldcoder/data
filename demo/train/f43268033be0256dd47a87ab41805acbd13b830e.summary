-- the last few days have perfectly encapsulated the @entity1 under @entity3 leadership			2
on wednesday , @entity1 @entity3 took the unprecedented action of voting to sue the president for doing his job and taking action to stand up for the @entity9 people			1
then on thursday , after @entity3 leadership failed to bring immigration legislation to the floor for a vote , the @entity11 leadership wrote : " there are numerous steps the president can and should be taking right now , without need for congressional action			1
... " baffled ? so am i ! sue the president for doing his job one day ; ask him to do their job for them the next			1
the hypocrisy is difficult to fathom			2
but somehow , it gets worse			0
their struggle to get a bill to the floor and failure to pass legislation that adequately addresses the crisis at the border would n't be unusual for this do - nothing @entity39 , except that we are coming up on the @entity35 , when members will leave @entity37 behind and return to work in their districts			1
while my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are home , i doubt they 'll find their constituents very happy that @entity39 spent one of our last few days in session voting to use their taxpayer dollars to sue the president			1
nor will they be impressed that we stayed in town an extra night so we could vote on a bill that would weaken the due process for children			0
voters are tired of the @entity3 obsession with obstruction			0
they are fed up with the more than 50 votes to repeal or undermine the @entity59 , and they do n't appreciate that @entity3 shut down the government over it , too			1
they do n't want @entity39 to waste more time and taxpayer money holding redundant hearings on @entity65			1
but that 's all the @entity3 @entity1 is offering them			0
@entity67 have an agenda that is actually in line with the priorities of @entity9 's families			0
we have a plan that will jump start the middle class and strengthen economic security for all @entity9			0
i know our members will hear from workers who agree with democrats that we need to create jobs that pay good wages and extend opportunities to join the middle class			0
no one who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty			1
we 've seen in states across the country that increasing the minimum wage boosts the economy and creates jobs by putting more money in workers ' pockets to spend			0
that 's why @entity67 will fight for an increase			0
with more women acting as their family 's primary breadwinner -- about 40 % in households with children -- there 's also public support for republicans to join @entity67 in passing the @entity106			1
equal pay is n't just a woman 's issue ; it 's an economic issue			2
there are many issues @entity39 could address that would actually help @entity9 's middle - class families : making greater investments in education , easing the burden of student loan debt , and taking action to hold off the looming threat of climate change			1
and on one of our nation 's most pressing issues , immigration reform , the @entity11 's insistence on adhering to rigid ideology , as well as putting their partisan stunts over real action that would help our country , is alarmingly apparent			0
if @entity133 were serious about addressing immigration reform , they could let us vote on the bipartisan @entity136 bill or fund president @entity138 's border request			2
instead , they have been fumbling with legislation that would hurt the immigrant community and make progress on actual reform more difficult			0
this august , when i 'm home in my district , i know i 'll be asked why @entity39 is wasting time and money suing the president instead of finding solutions to the pressing issues that our nation faces			1
the only answer i can give them is that @entity3 leadership in the @entity1 cares more about scoring political points against the president than they do about helping @entity9 's middle - class families			1
it 's not an answer i 'm proud of , and i do n't think voters will be happy with it either			2
but come november , @entity9 will have a chance to choose leaders who are looking out for them and focused on finding real solutions to real problems by casting their ballots for @entity67			2
join us on @entity170 / @entity169 .			0
