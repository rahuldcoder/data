@entity0 -- @entity3 's former security chief is slamming the country 's prime minister and defense minister for their handling of @entity9 , saying neither one inspires confidence			1
" i do n't trust a leadership that relies on messianic leadership , " said @entity11 , the former head of the @entity12 , the country 's internal security service , at a public conference friday night in @entity3			1
" our two messiahs from @entity23 and from the @entity24 are not fit to stand at the helm of the government , " @entity11 said , referring to the respective residences of prime minister @entity19 and defense minister @entity20			1
his comments were widely reported in the @entity3 media saturday			0
@entity20 said while he welcomed @entity11 's entry into politics , the comments are irresponsible			1
" it is both embarrassing and saddening to see the weakening of judgment and responsibility and the low language a man who served the public for years was dragged into , " said a statement from @entity20 's office			2
" @entity11 is acting in a petty , irresponsible manner motivated by personal frustration			0
he is harming the heritage of generations of @entity12 heads and the operational norms of the organization			0
" a senior @entity3 government official said that the comments lacked credibility because the domestic security focus of the @entity12 made the organization a " peripheral player " when it comes to @entity9			1
the same official , who declined to be named publicly due to the sensitivity of the issue , said @entity11 's comments were " both surprising and strange " because he had worked under both @entity19 and @entity20 , and sought to become @entity60 director under their leadership			1
" are you saying these things because you did n't get the position ? " the official asked rhetorically , adding that @entity11 's attack seemed more " personal than policy			2
" @entity11 , a widely respected former security official , also took the two @entity3 leaders to task for mis - characterizing the possible effectiveness of a military strike against @entity9 and its nuclear program			1
he said the @entity3 government presented " a false view to the public on the @entity9 bomb , as though acting against @entity9 would prevent a nuclear bomb			0
but attacking @entity9 will encourage them to develop a bomb all the faster			2
" it is not the first time a high - profile figure has criticized the @entity3 government 's handling of @entity9			0
@entity85 , the former chief of @entity3 's spy agency , the @entity60 , has been a frequent and vocal critic of talk about an @entity3 strike on @entity9 , famously calling it a " stupid idea			0
" @entity3 vice-premier and @entity93 party member @entity92 told the @entity94 that @entity11 should not have spoken in public			0
" i think that @entity11 was wrong to say what he did , and that when he considers what he said he will realize that he was wrong , " @entity92 said			0
@entity11 's blunt commentary follows controversial remarks by @entity3 's top general , who said @entity9 is led by " very rational people " and does n't appear poised to build a nuclear bomb that would threaten his nation			1
@entity9 " is going step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb , " chief of staff lt. gen. @entity107 told @entity3 's @entity110 newspaper in wednesday editions			2
" it has n't yet decided whether to go the extra mile			0
" those comments were in stark contrast to those of @entity19 , who suggested to @entity1 that time is running out for @entity123 sanctions on @entity9 to have a meaningful effect on @entity126 's nuclear program			1
the sanctions " are certainly taking a bite out of the @entity9 economy , " @entity19 said in an interview broadcast tuesday on @entity1 's " @entity128			2
" but , he said , " they have n't rolled back the @entity9 program -- or even stopped it -- by one iota			0
