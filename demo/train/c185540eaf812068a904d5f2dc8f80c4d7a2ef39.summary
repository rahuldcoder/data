-- like most couples , my wife and i were discussing marriage before we officially got engaged			2
but we discovered that we could not keep our private information private			1
once we started discussing engagement rings in ( supposedly ) private @entity10 messages to each other , my web browser became inundated with engagement ring advertisements			1
from then on , anyone in the same room with me knew our plans			2
the aphorism is true : if you 're not paying for the product or service , you are the product or service being sold			1
like most people who use computers , the information in your private message or web search is being sold to an advertiser			1
the ads continue to follow you around , popping up at the most inopportune moments when a friend , relative or co-worker happens to be near your screen			1
we get @entity10 for free , and we do our web searches for free , but the price we pay is our personal data , which are used by advertisers to entice us to buy things that they think we want			1
it does n't have to be this way			2
i would gladly pay a reasonable fee to @entity10 and @entity44 if they would allow me to keep my private information private			1
i 'm hardly alone in my disenchantment with the tech world 's use of people 's personal information			1
embarrassing and out - of - context @entity52 advertisements are affecting nearly everyone who uses the @entity55 these days			1
my friend @entity56 , a college professor in @entity57 , @entity58 , who is happily married to a woman , once wrote a paper about how homosexual @entity61 are covered in evangelical magazines , which required online research			1
" i felt like i was getting ads about gay - friendly vacations and dating services for months , " he told me			1
" fortunately , mrs. @entity67 knew about my project			0
" @entity69 , a magazine editor in @entity70 , @entity71 , was recently looking for baby shower gifts for a pregnant friend			0
right on cue , her web browser became flooded with neverending ads for parenting magazines and onesies			1
" my husband saw them on my computer and was like , ' is there something you 're not telling me ? ' " she said			0
although these examples are innocuous and even humorous , other targeted advertisements based on ( ostensibly ) private information can seem intrusive or disturbing			1
a friend of mine who asked that i not use her name told me about an experience she had when she discovered that she was pregnant			0
not surprisingly , she immediately began conducting web searches related to her pregnancy			0
excited and happy , she and her husband started making plans for the baby			0
if that were the end of the story , the targeted ads would have been fine			1
and the targeted ads kept coming			2
" it was hard for me even though it was such a short - lived pregnancy , " she said			2
" it was like rubbing salt in the wound			0
" the programs that scan your web activities do not discriminate			0
being non-human , they can not show sensitivity or propriety			0
any clue you 've given is fair game			0
distressed about a dying relative ? do n't be surprised to see ads from funeral homes			2
planning to buy your spouse a surprise gift ? it wo n't be a surprise when an ad for that specific gift pops up suspiciously on your browser the next day , when the two of you are sharing the computer			0
i should add that it 's not just @entity44 and @entity10 that engage in these practices			1
many websites choose to run ads that are specifically targeted toward users			2
i 'm always fascinated by the way people rush to defend the reigning tech companies			0
one example : no one is forcing you to use these websites			0
true , but that 's sort of the same thing as telling a person in a small city with no public transportation that they 're not legally required to get a car			0
if you want to participate in normal daily life , what other option do you have ? another example is the " terms of service " defense			0
if you use @entity10 or @entity44 , you have agreed to their terms of service			1
that may be true from a strictly legal standpoint , but from a practical standpoint , this defense falls apart			0
as @entity161 pointed out in an article in the @entity163 , reading all the privacy policies you encounter in a typical year would take many days			2
finally , there 's the " opt out " defense , which goes something like this : " hey , the tech companies are n't trying to get you to do anything you do n't want to do			0
you can adjust your privacy settings			2
really ? tech companies have their own interests to look over			0
that 's why , despite a class - action settlement meant to ensure @entity10 users ' agreement to their " likes " being used in ads , the practice continues under the radar			1
the public has been whipped into a frenzy lately by revelations of @entity184 overreach			0
it 's interesting to me that people are n't equally concerned about privacy violations by tech companies			2
" do n't be evil , " @entity44 used to say			0
but that 's also a pretty low standard			0
how about adding an additional goal : do more good			0
" @entity10 is free , and always will be			1
continue to offer the free version for people who do n't care about their privacy			1
i 'll take the " premium " version , pay for it with actual money and keep my personal information to myself			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity206 : when i go online , data from my private messages are sold to advertiser
@entity204 : we get @entity10 for free , but the price we pay is our privacy
he says embarrassing and out - of - context @entity52 ads are affecting nearly everyone
@entity204 : i would rather pay @entity10 a fee in order to keep my personal data private
