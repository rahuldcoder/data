@entity0 -- the @entity2 defended its scrutiny of reporters around a high - profile national security leak investigation , saying on tuesday that it followed its own regulations in acquiring subpoenas for @entity9 phone records			1
but a letter from @entity11 , principal deputy assistant attorney general , to members of @entity13 failed to answer a key question asked by lawmakers : when did attorney general @entity16 formally recuse himself from the leak investigation ? @entity16 said in congressional testimony that he took that step to avoid a possible conflict of interest because he had been interviewed about the leak during the course of the investigation			1
that investigation centered on who told the @entity9 about a 2012 plot by an @entity27 affiliate in @entity28 to bomb an airliner			1
opinion : @entity16 should discuss leaks publicly the issue has generated sharp political controversy			0
lawmakers have claimed investigative overreach by the @entity37 administration and media outlets have expressed concerned about the potential chilling effect of such efforts on press freedoms			0
specifically , the @entity42 are concerned about whether @entity16 was being truthful during may 15 congressional testimony			0
" with regard to potential prosecution of the press for the disclosure of material , that is not something that i have ever been involved in , heard of , or would think would be a wise policy , " @entity16 said			0
it later came to light @entity16 had authorized a search warrants for e-mails and subpoenas for phone records in another leak case in which the government indicated a tv reporter was suspected of breaking the law			0
the letter from @entity11 in response to congressional follow - up to @entity16 's testimony said deputy attorney general @entity68 , who approved the subpoenas for the @entity9 records , also had been interviewed by investigators during the leak probe			1
5 things about the controversy surrounding ag @entity16 according to the letter , @entity68 did not have any contacts with the media at the time " thus avoiding the appearance of a conflict of interest			0
" the subpoenas involved records for more than 20 @entity9 phone lines for part of april and may 2012			2
the toll records would show what numbers were dialed from the @entity9 lines and what numbers dialed in , but would not provide any information on the content of conversations			0
according to the letter to the @entity93 , the @entity2 followed its rules and exhausted other methods to find out who might have leaked the classified information before seeking the phone records			1
the letter said investigators conducted more than 550 interviews and examined tens of thousands of pages of documents before issuing subpoenas involving the @entity9 lines			1
@entity2 rules call for negotiations with news organizations on such issues unless there is a " substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation			2
" the @entity2 said because the investigation was ongoing it could n't provide specific information on why the @entity2 did n't go directly to the @entity9			2

*justice* @entity116 response to @entity13 says it followed rules in scrutiny of @entity9
@entity13 wants to know when attorney general recused himself from leak probe
@entity2 sought to find out who told @entity9 about @entity27 airliner plot
