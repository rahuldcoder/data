@entity0 -- @entity2 gave final approval friday to a giant transportation funding bill as part of a package that includes a measure holding down interest rates on federal student loans			1
both issues are priorities of president @entity12 's , and the legislation demonstrated rare bipartisan agreement in the deeply divided @entity2			1
the package won @entity17 approval with a 74 - 19 vote after passing the @entity19 373 - 52			0
hours later , president @entity12 signed into a law a bill that temporarily -- from june 30 through july 6 -- assures there will be continued funding for certain transportation projects and halts potential student loan interest rate hikes , according to a news release issued by the @entity19 shortly after 8 p.m. friday			1
he could sign the larger legislation at a later date , presumably by the end of next week before the stopgap bill expires			1
compromises on the transportation bill and the student loan issue , as well as a third component reauthorizing national flood insurance , came in rare bipartisan agreement during the same week that @entity19 @entity35 enraged @entity36 by voting to hold attorney general @entity37 in contempt of @entity2			1
none of the rancor from thursday 's contempt vote was evident friday , as legislators involved in reaching the compromise praised the bipartisan effort			0
the top senators in the negotiations , democrat @entity47 of @entity48 and @entity35 @entity49 of @entity50 , issued a joint statement expressing thanks and praise for all involved in getting the package passed			0
a @entity19 statement said the legislation prevents middle - class families from getting hurt by congressional inaction on extending transportation funding and preventing the federal student loan rate from doubling			1
passing the package meant @entity2 beat looming deadlines , with highway repair funding and the lower student loan rates set to expire saturday			1
the transportation bill funds construction for highways , bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation			1
@entity12 has pushed for it as a way to boost job growth in the construction industry , and both parties expressed interest in reaching a deal			2
still , enactment of the measure marks a significant accomplishment for legislators			0
in recent years , @entity2 was able to agree only on a series of short - term extensions of the previous transportation bill passed in 2005			1
aides predicted the final bill would get the large bipartisan majorities it did , although some @entity35 opposed the measure 's price of just over $ 100 billion			2
both parties had to compromise on core issues			0
republicans dropped language that would have approved the @entity97 pipeline and prevented the @entity98 from regulating harmful coal ash waste from power plants			0
democrats were forced to accept @entity35 demands to streamline and speed up the federal review process of construction projects			2
republicans said that doing so would cut permitting times in half			0
they also got reforms that would allow states to opt out of federal mandates to spend highway dollars on bike paths and highway beautification projects			2
doing so , @entity35 said , would allow states to spend more on critical infrastructure projects			0
although the agreement includes many of the reforms the @entity19 @entity35 pushed for , it falls far short of the broader transportation and energy bill that @entity19 speaker @entity121 unveiled this year			2
@entity121 , @entity122 , framed that initial proposal -- which combined road and bridge projects with provisions promoting greater domestic energy production such as more drilling on public lands and approval of the @entity97 -- as a major jobs bill			2
however , internal @entity35 divisions forced @entity19 @entity35 leaders to pull the measure and it never got a floor vote			0
the energy portions of the bill did pass the @entity19 , but none of those were included in the final measure negotiated with the @entity17			0
the student loan measure will keep interest rates at the current 3.4 % rate , which was set to double to 6.8 % on sunday			1
@entity12 brought national attention to the student loan issue and started campaigning for it in april			1
after the certain @entity35 candidate for president , @entity147 , also said he supported extending the lower rate , @entity2 got serious about looking for ways to make it happen for another year			0
during negotiations this week , legislators decided the revenue to pay the $ 6 billion cost should come from changes to the way companies fund pension programs			0
the deal would also limit how long undergraduate students can go to school without accruing interest on student loans to six years			1
@entity165 's @entity164 and @entity1 's @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
