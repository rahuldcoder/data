-- i suppose @entity2 are to be congratulated for nominating a @entity4 as their @entity6 candidate in @entity7			1
i recall when @entity2 lowlifes mocked and lied about the war heroism of @entity10 , and just last year @entity11 was saying the @entity12 was a " handout " and @entity13 voted for president @entity14 because they wanted " gifts			2
" but if you 're looking for a " new kind of @entity2 , " @entity17 is not your candidate			1
he has called himself that			0
but in a recent debate , he admitted he would vote for @entity23 nominees who would repeal @entity24			0
he opposes the assault weapon ban , which even @entity27 supported			0
so to the extent that 's new , it 's moving in the wrong direction in the eyes of most @entity7 voters			0
he opposes @entity33 , even though it 's working in @entity7 already , and it was so dear to the heart of @entity7 ' legendary @entity37			1
he has said he is open to repealing the home mortgage deduction for middle - class @entity40 but helped himself to a $ 281,500 income tax deduction in 2005 for not making changes to the facade of his pricey house			0
republicans hammering the middle class but helping the rich -- that 's not exactly new either			0
as a private equity financier , @entity17 -- in the words of the @entity50 -- served as a director of several companies " while they took on significant debt and cut jobs or moved overseas			2
" a @entity7 @entity2 who got rich while laying folks off and shipping jobs overseas ? where have i heard that before ? @entity61 : gomez a dream candidate for @entity2 @entity17 is not a new kind of @entity2			1
and that is why he is going to lose			0
in the @entity6 , democrat @entity65 will fight alongside @entity7 ' rising star , @entity66 ; @entity17 would cancel her vote			1
@entity65 will support president @entity14 ; @entity17 will oppose him			1
@entity65 will stand for progressive change : an increase in the minimum wage , universal prekindergarten , tax fairness , rebuilding our roads and bridges and more			0
@entity17 will empower obstructionist republicans like @entity2 leader @entity77 and the tea party extremists			2
that is why @entity65 will win and @entity17 will lose : because it 's not enough to just say you 're new			1
@entity83 , i could say i 'm @entity84 , but it wo n't change the fact that i 'm a middle - aged balding dude			0
@entity17 's military record is impressive , and his immigrant story is all - american			1
but his politics are just more of the same old @entity2 line .			2

@entity2 @entity17 is running against @entity93 @entity65 for @entity6 seat
@entity96 : @entity17 is *styled* as a " new kind of @entity2 , " but that 's far from true
@entity100 : his military record is impressive , but his politics are standard old @entity2
@entity100 : he opposes @entity33 and *abortion* and is on the side of the *wealthy*
