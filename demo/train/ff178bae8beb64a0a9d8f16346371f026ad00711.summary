-- you could say there is only one swing state that really matters in 2012 : @entity4			1
whether ( and how and when ) @entity4 acts to save the euro will exert huge influence over the @entity8 economy , too , and thus over the outcome of the presidential election			1
next question : how much influence ? everybody agrees that the troubles in the eurozone hurt the @entity8 economy			1
when your trading partners slump , you slump with them			0
everybody agrees that the uncertainty over the future of the euro currency worries @entity8 financial markets			1
if the currency fails , @entity24 banks plunge into a crisis that would be a replay of the shock of 2008			0
but what remains deeply uncertain is the upside of the equation : how much benefit would the @entity8 gain , if @entity24 did somehow find a solution to the euro problem ? it 's clear that @entity4 chancellor @entity36 has the power by saying " no " to lose the presidency for @entity39			1
could she win it for him with a " yes " ? by the trade numbers , faster growth in @entity24 would seem relatively unimportant to the @entity8 economy			1
trade accounts for only about a quarter of the @entity8 economy , and trade with the entire @entity48 represents less than a fifth of that one - fifth			1
now remember that the @entity48 includes a number of important countries , such as the @entity52 , that do not use the euro			0
and the largest economy in the eurozone , @entity4 , continues to buy and sell strongly			2
a fillip to the economies of @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 would be welcome news but hardly decisive to a @entity8 economy still recovering from its own financial crisis			1
yet trade numbers may understate the story			0
here in the @entity8 , the raw materials for recovery are all at hand			2
@entity8 corporations are earning record profits			2
they have accumulated vast reserves of cash			0
they are investing , and they have begun to hire , too			0
as @entity39 likes to note , more people are at work today in the @entity8 private sector than on the day he took office			1
( he does not add that far fewer were at work when the recession began in december 2007			0
) in aggregate , though , the pace of recovery continues weak			0
the rocket is lifting off , but it is not achieving escape velocity			0
something more is needed ! the program needed to save the euro could provide a piece of that " something			0
" to save the euro , @entity4 will have to agree not only to a financial rescue of other countries ' banks but to a big program to stimulate the @entity4 economy , still one of the world 's top five			1
somebody has to buy , and with @entity102 and @entity103 slowing down , @entity4 -- a much richer country -- would emerge as what the @entity8 was in the early 2000s : the world 's consumer of last resort			1
over the horizon , we can see the dawn of the next great chapter of @entity8 economic expansion : the conversion from coal - fired electricity to a new energy economy based on the exploitation of the vast quantities of natural gas entrapped in @entity8 shale formations			2
gas emits only about half as much carbon dioxide per unit of energy as coal , so it is more environmentally benign as well as cheap			0
the conversion process will be a vast undertaking , putting money and people to work			0
to close the gap from here to there , though , the @entity8 needs a jolt			2
could a euro rescue administer it ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			2

@entity138 : whether @entity4 saves the euro is *key* to 2012 @entity8 election
he says @entity36 has power to ease crisis , boost world economy
@entity8 's economy is *poised* to grow *sharply* , if uncertainty over euro is eased , he says
@entity152 : @entity39 's *re-election* could hinge on the actions of the @entity4 *government*
