-- a recent torrent of complaints has prompted @entity4 ceo @entity3 to issue a public apology for the company 's new maps app in the @entity8 and @entity9 , which previously relied on @entity11			1
addresses are not showing up correctly , public transit directions are n't available , and the satellite views make it look as if the @entity16 is bending into the @entity17			0
unlike the naysayers , i was delighted to see the change			2
that 's because six months ago , i broke up with @entity11			1
it 's not a decision i made lightly			2
i was in an intimate relationship with the company for years			0
@entity11 knew what i watched on @entity27 and which trains i caught into @entity28 for a night out			1
it facilitated collaborations with my colleagues and helped me navigate foreign cities			0
we had some good times together , @entity11 and @entity34 opinion : why a naked @entity4 would be a better company but over time , our relationship changed			1
ads started to show up based on keywords that i had typed into the search engine or in my e-mail			0
in @entity11 search , things i was looking for were now buried beneath " helpful " suggestions of things i was n't interested in in the slightest			1
the problem was @entity11 's latest privacy policy , which went into effect in march			1
@entity11 's new rules mean that in addition to tracking your activities , it can aggregate your data across its many services and platforms such as @entity11 , @entity57 , search , and @entity59 , for starters			1
why does @entity11 collect and aggregate your information ? because when @entity11 has a better picture of who you are , what you like and what you do online , it becomes even more attractive to advertisers			1
while @entity11 's ecosystem offers many appealing perks and conveniences , the price you pay is your personal data			1
in short , when you use a @entity11 service , you 're not using a product -- you are the product			1
so i took matters into my own hands , and broke up with @entity11			1
anyone coming out of a long - term relationship will tell you that breaking up is hard to do			2
you have to change your patterns			0
my first step was obviously to switch search engines			0
but to what ? the old alternatives are all gone , absorbed by @entity11 , @entity84 and @entity85			1
to make matters worse , i discovered that my own devices were working against me			0
clicking a link on my computer or phone automatically opened @entity11 , search , or @entity27			2
i had to find new ways			0
juggling directions from @entity94 , @entity85 and @entity95 has led me on several wild goose chases while trying to get from a to @entity97 i also spread my activities across multiple servers			0
i deleted my @entity27 account , set my search engine to @entity102 ( a service that does n't track search information ) , and logged into @entity104			0
deleting my @entity57 account was the hardest -- and most revealing			0
it reminded me of the evil computer @entity108 's death scene at the end of " 2001 : a @entity111			2
" as i selected all the messages i have ever received and clicked the delete button , the system protested : was i sure i wanted to do this ? it reminded me of all our good times together by telling me we 'd shared " 38,496 conversations since 2008			0
" in defense of my stupidphone the ad bar stopped showing ads and started displaying environmentally friendly statements			0
did i know that " there is no limit to the number of times an aluminum can can be recycled " ? or that " empty tissue boxes can provide easy and handy storage for plastic grocery bags " ? i felt pangs of guilt and regret			0
when the screen finally displayed , " you do n't have any mail ! our servers are feeling unloved , " i almost changed my mind			0
that 's when it hit me			2
i thought we had an intimate relationship , when in fact i was being manipulated into codependence			0
service by service , @entity11 had convinced me that i needed it for everything , all to seduce me into giving up more of my personal data			1
of course , @entity4 collects user information as well			1
but it is not the company 's main source of revenue			2
@entity4 users pay for their products in dollars , not in personal information			1
its closed system of products and devices , while decried among tech pundits , is its advantage			0
@entity4 also has a long history of treating its users not like products , but like consumers			1
this incentivizes improvements that put the user first , giving us a more powerful voice			2
after all , we can vote with our dollars and with our downloads			0
breaking the @entity11 monopoly means that all of our choices can improve			1
and that 's why @entity4 's leaving @entity11 is a step in the right direction			1
in the meanwhile , as long as i know where my information is going , i do n't mind getting a little lost			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

user complaints prompted @entity4 to apologize for its new maps app
@entity186 : i was delighted that @entity4 no longer relied on @entity11
she says @entity11 's privacy policy aggregated users ' personal data for profit
@entity186 : breaking the @entity11 monopoly means that all of our choices can improve
