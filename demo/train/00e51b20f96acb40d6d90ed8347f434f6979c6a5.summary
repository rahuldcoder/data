@entity0 -- it 's easy to ask why @entity3 would want to buy @entity4 when its share of the smartphone handset market is sliding			1
what can @entity3 possibly do to reverse @entity4 's fading fortunes ? the emails from analysts pouring into my inbox are evenly split -- great idea or a disaster ; relatively cheap bet by @entity3 ( at $ 7 billion ) or a share price - eroding move			1
read more : why deal is good for both so , can @entity3 leverage its monopoly selling software and services contracts to corporations , and get a slice of the employees ' mobile business ? or , by getting a product which it is already in partnership with , is @entity3 simply buying the cow when it 's already getting the milk ? watch more : @entity3 's deal with @entity4 the deal comes as no surprise			1
when @entity33 left @entity3 more than two years ago to become @entity4 's first @entity35 ceo , it seemed logical the two companies would eventually meld			1
one question rightly being asked , is whether rival handset makers or operators will simply stop making phones with @entity3 's mobile operating system			1
in my view , it does n't matter			0
@entity4 and @entity3 joined ranks two years ago and the others were a fraction of @entity3 's fraction of the mobile operating market			1
read more : is one mobile enough ? the question in my mind , is whether @entity3 can take its mobile operating system and make it a player in the burgeoning market of cheap smartphones			2
@entity4 still makes more handsets than any other manufacturer , and now that 's @entity3 's business			1
@entity4 's market share was 23.4 % in the last quarter of 2012 , according to research firm @entity61			2
that 's because @entity4 sells an enormous number of cheaper mobiles in emerging markets			2
@entity3 's task , then , is to stuff a cheaper version of its smartphone os into these more affordable phones			1
the sales channel is there			0
the brand name of @entity4 is known the world over			0
@entity3 is an expert at sales and marketing			0
the bigger task may be to integrate more than 30,000 employees into the @entity3 ecosystem			2
many companies gamble that a bolt - on acquisition is the sure - fire solution to a missing piece of the puzzle			0
but it can set a company up to fail			0
a real competitor to @entity87 and the @entity88 could be around the corner			0
but it will be a huge task for @entity92 's successor .			0

what does @entity3 see in @entity4 , a business whose share of the smartphone handset market is sliding ?
the answers to this question vary , @entity100 *writes* . but there is *potential* for this to be a *win* for both
@entity3 will need to figure out a way to tap the cheaper smartphone market
it will need to do this while also ensuring the two companies are merged -- not an easy task
