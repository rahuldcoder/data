-- when a man with hands drenched in blood stands just feet away from the body of a person he just hacked to death , still holding the murder weapons , we want to believe he must be crazy			2
how else can our minds grasp the evidence that someone would carry out an act of such inconceivable brutality ? we do n't yet know all the details surrounding wednesday 's killing in @entity16			0
but the fact is we have seen this type of attack before , and even before one of the suspects started ranting to passers - by , we had a pretty good idea what to expect			1
this killing of a young @entity27 soldier was not an act of insanity			0
it was part of a pattern that has struck in many parts of the world before			0
this was the product of extreme @entity37 radicalism we have all come to recognize			1
some will rush to blame @entity38 or @entity39 for what happened , but it 's important to be clear and not to mince words			1
@entity39 is not the enemy			1
@entity38 are not the enemy			1
terrorism is not the enemy			1
the enemy is the radical @entity37 ideology that justifies any atrocity committed for political motives			1
the enemies are the people who promote this dogma and encourage others to engage in actions that offend and assault our humanity -- and theirs			0
as information started trickling in from @entity16 , the familiar phrases started emerging , confirming our initial suspicions and no doubt disheartening @entity38 who would like to see their religion stop having any association with these atrocities			1
witnesses said they heard the two men shouting " @entity66 " as they worked to dismember their victim			0
they say one of them breathlessly declared " by almighty @entity68 we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone			0
" a similar attack happened a few years ago in @entity71			2
the @entity73 filmmaker and columnist @entity74 was assassinated and nearly decapitated by a @entity39 radical angered by @entity74 's work criticizing @entity39			1
the @entity16 murderers apparently justified their butchery as resentment over @entity81 troops fighting in @entity39 lands			1
" muslims are dying daily , " the man with the bloody hands said			0
but before accepting that argument at face value , consider that radical islamists have found other reasons to slaughter those who offend them			2
and the threshold for triggering brutality seems rather movable			0
the @entity37 radical who murdered @entity74 , @entity94 , used a knife to pin a letter to his victim 's body , explaining his actions and threatening to kill @entity100 , an ex-muslim and friend of the director , who remains a fierce critic of @entity39			1
the letter is a screed against @entity107 and an attempt to intimidate anyone who speaks critically of @entity39			1
@entity37 radicalism provided the twisted justification for the @entity113 bombings , for the videotaped decapitation of journalist @entity115 , for the shooting rampage of maj. @entity117 , who killed 13 people in @entity119 , @entity120			1
and let 's not forget 9/11 , the crown jewel of murderous achievements			2
their political / religious ideology has motivated killers in @entity127 , @entity16 , @entity128 , @entity129 , as well as @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
the creed that demands murder , sometimes murder - suicide , for perceived offenses against @entity39 and against @entity38 constitutes a threat to societies at large , not just to @entity81 and @entity140			1
in fact , a study finds that @entity38 are its most numerous victims			1
while police were still working the crime scene in @entity16 , @entity27 prime minister @entity143 said the attack was probably an act of terrorism			1
the question of whether this particular incident falls under the label of terrorism is not particularly useful			0
we will hear discussions about whether the perpetrators belonged to a larger organization or were , instead , " lone wolves " or " self - radicalized			0
" in the end , the purpose was political intimidation , and inciting fear was its political objective			0
for what it 's worth , that 's terrorism			0
but that does not identify the enemy that must be fought			0
the killing in broad daylight in @entity16 's @entity180 neighborhood belongs in the category of @entity37 radical attacks , the same that brought 9/11 , the @entity184 massacres in @entity131 , restaurant bombings in @entity129 , night club killings in @entity173 , street explosions in @entity175 , hotel bombings in @entity169 and many other massacres in many countries			1
each incident has its own peculiarities , its own list of grievances			0
but they all contain the same explosive ideology			0
most @entity38 strongly oppose this kind of brutality			1
but a recent @entity194 poll showed significant minorities favor actions such as suicide bombings " in defense of @entity39			2
" a troubling 29 % of @entity199 @entity38 say suicide bombings can be justified , so do 40 % of @entity38 in the @entity200 , 15 % in @entity201 and 18 % in @entity202			2
the " defense of @entity39 " means different things to different people			2
extremists have killed to defend @entity39 from modern westernized culture			2
they have killed women for daring to go to school			0
the victims often have nothing to do with the alleged offense			0
the @entity214 brothers ' victims in @entity215 had nothing to do with the offenses that angered their killers			0
an important element in the fight against this pernicious , callous enemy is a campaign to undermine the ideology 's appeal within @entity39 communities everywhere			1
there is much work to do , particularly by the vast majority of @entity38 who reject extremism , by their leaders who must be pressured by all of us to make the ironclad case that nothing , nothing in the world , justifies the kind of viciousness that assaulted our senses in @entity16 and has done so in too many places for too many years			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity243 .			0

@entity245 : we want to believe hacking suspects are crazy to explain the atrocity
@entity250 : but it appears , as it has so often , radical @entity37 ideology *fueled* attack
@entity39 , @entity38 or terrorism are not the enemy , she says . it is this murderous ideology
@entity250 : we need campaigns in @entity39 communities everywhere against its appeal
