@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity7 , a lot of the meetings that take place between lawmakers amount to nothing			0
but recently , there was a get - together that was really something			1
@entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 , @entity16 , along with sens. @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 , @entity20			1
the problem : what this country should do with so - called @entity24 , undocumented young people who were brought here by their parents as children and who face the threat of deportation			0
one proposed solution that did n't go anywhere was the @entity33 , a bill that politicians passed around like a hot potato for more than a decade			1
it would offer legal status and a pathway to citizenship to anyone who goes to college or joins the military			1
the good news is that there was bipartisan support ; the last time it was put to a vote , in december 2010 , a slew of @entity49 voted for it , but so did three @entity51 republicans -- @entity52 of @entity53 , @entity54 of @entity55 and @entity56 of @entity57			0
the bad news is that there is bipartisan opposition ; a slew of republicans opposed the legislation , but so did five @entity49 -- @entity64 and @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 of @entity68 , @entity69 of @entity70 and @entity71 of @entity72			0
clearly we need a new approach			0
the @entity76 @entity62 rock star and potential @entity62 vice presidential nominee is floating the idea of a modified @entity33 that would keep undocumented immigrant students from being deported by giving them legal status in the form of a student visa followed by a work visa			1
the idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by sen. @entity87 , @entity88 , who , along with her colleague , sen. @entity89 , @entity90 , was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the @entity33 and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives			0
now @entity87 and @entity89 have faded to the background , and @entity17 is shopping the idea			1
no formal proposal has been released , but that has n't stopped pundits and politicos from voicing their opinions about the concept			1
under the proposal , there is no yellow brick road to citizenship , but nor is there a roadblock			2
the young people would just have to find their own way there , if they even wanted to be @entity114 citizens			0
you know who does want to give these students automatic citizenship ? democrats , who are salivating over the prospect of perhaps hundreds of thousands of new voters with a grudge against @entity62			0
and you know who is dead - set against giving them citizenship ? republicans , who want to avoid the ire of these newly minted voters			0
democrats may think these kids are adorable , but they do n't want to adopt them and become known as the " illegal immigrant party			2
" i suspect that 's the real reason five @entity49 helped kill the @entity33			1
follow @ @entity139 on @entity140 and at @entity142 / @entity141 the fact that @entity17 is now attached to the proposal is a mixed blessing			1
@entity17 might have enough leverage within his party to persuade some republicans who voted against the old @entity33 to support @entity33 2.0			1
the bad news is that @entity49 are afraid of @entity17 , and many of them have no interest in supporting any bill that makes the rising star look good			1
given all that , i 'll bet the @entity159 " hangout " on the @entity33 was not exactly an event that was officially sanctioned by either party			0
so what ? that 's a good thing			2
this is an encouraging new model			2
let 's hope we see more of these efforts to informally reach across party lines and forge bipartisan solutions on a variety of public policy issues			2
providing legal status to undocumented college students and members of the armed forces is one issue where the partisan lines are blurred and the politics are very complicated			1
there are no good guys and bad guys , just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students			2
it seems these four lawmakers do			0
what @entity17 has in mind might not be perfect , but it 's the only entree on the menu			1
if the @entity159 @entity49 think they can make it better , they should make suggestions			0
then both sides should go back to their respective parties and pressure their colleagues to come onboard			2
it matters to the deliberations that these lawmakers are all @entity159			0
regardless of party , whether they realize it or not , they have a natural kinship			0
a @entity62 like @entity17 has a cultural connection to democrats like @entity13 , @entity19 and @entity15			1
that is something to build on			0
these guys might argue when they talk politics , but at least they can argue in @entity211			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214			1

latino legislators met recently to seek progress on status of " @entity219 "
@entity214 says it 's encouraging that they *'re* talking about a *compromise*
he asks : will political parties let that happen , or kill it to preserve a campaign issue ?
@entity214 : @entity17 's proposal is n't perfect but it does show progress
