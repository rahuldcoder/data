@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's the latest executive craze sweeping boardrooms across the globe , and a tiny score is becoming as sought - after as a low handicap on the golf course			1
@entity10 's @entity9 : breaking into markets beyond traditional gamers " @entity20 , " or " @entity21 " as it 's known in @entity22 , is a collection of quick - fire maths quizzes , anagrams , music recitals and memory tests developed by @entity10 with @entity19 neuroscientist dr. @entity18			1
the game is part of @entity10 's attempt to widen the appeal of its game consoles , especially the cute little @entity9 , beyond typical gamers -- in this case , to an older audience concerned with its health			1
" exercise is the key to good health both for body and mind , " says the company 's @entity33 web site			1
" playing regularly for just a few minutes a day has been found to stimulate parts of the brain related to thinking , creativity and concentration , " claims the @entity10 web site			1
and the tactic is working : with over 10 million copies of " @entity20 " and " more brain training " sold worldwide , and with celebrity endorsements from @entity49 and @entity50 , dr. @entity18 and his brain exercises have become a global phenomenon			1
but does @entity10 's " @entity20 " actually make you smarter ? the expert 's opinion i spoke to dr. @entity58 , a cognitive neuroscientist at @entity60 , to find out what improvements i could expect to see in my brain			1
she reveals that it is hard to measure the impact that brain training could have on my day - to - day life			1
" it is a complex thing to determine whether learning on one thing transfers to another thing , " she explains			1
but can training on certain tasks make you smarter ? " it depends what we think being smart is all about , " she says , adding that if the tasks were similar to iq tests , i might see a small increase in my iq			1
dr. @entity50 does point to research that suggests exercising one 's brain does work -- and might even help to prevent those dreaded " senior moments			1
" " learning of any kind does forge new neuronal connections , " she reveals			1
" evidence seems to support the ' use it or lose it ' mantra with respect to staving off neuronal degeneration in old age			2
" and dr. @entity50 is keen to dispel the myth that once we 're adults , we 're too old to learn			2
" there are numerous examples of learning in adulthood and structural brain changes accompanying this , " she says			2
so now it 's down to me			1
attracted by the prospect of a lean , mean , mind machine , i decided to put it to a three - week test			2
watch out @entity49 , here i come ... day 1 the @entity9 arrives in the afternoon			1
mmm , shiny ! i test my brain age : it 's 41 , considerably older than my actual age , and far from a " perfect " age of 20			1
will i ever be as smart as @entity50 ? i work through the exercises			2
they 're surprisingly fun , pandering as they do to my inner dork tendencies			2
day 2 i play the brain training games on the subway and equal or improve my scores			2
" what an improvement ! i could almost cry ! " says dr. @entity18			2
i 'm not quite so excited			2
i become so engrossed in " @entity20 " that i nearly miss my stop , leap off the train , stylus and console in hand , and stand at the bottom of the escalators trying to complete a game			1
my fellow commuters -- quite rightly -- throw me pitying looks			2
i 'm so flustered i leave the tube station by the wrong exit and end up wandering dazedly around central @entity1 , trying to find my office			2
worse still , my brain age is still a less - than - sprightly 40			2
brain training ? brain draining ! day 3 following yesterday 's mishaps , i rule out brain age checks on the subway			1
my brain age drops to 30			2
result ! day 5 after a stressful weekend moving house , i kick back and relax with a glass of wine and dr. @entity18			2
big mistake ! my tiredness and the alcohol leave me fumbling and just one drink raises my brain age to a wobbly 37			0
i cast blameful glances at the @entity146 , and resolve to stay sober for testing			0
day 6 i fluff the exercises , the new one 's a nightmare and dr. @entity18 is tormenting me with a 5x5 square of random numbers that i 'm supposed to remember			1
woe ! time to check my brain age			0
i expect to see it increase to 50 + on stress alone , but am amazed when , for the first time , i break through the 30 barrier ! brain age of 27 : read it and weep , @entity49			0
day 7 it 's a week in ; i zip through the exercises and tackle the test			1
my brain age drops again to 24			0
@entity162 hoo ! day 10 i skip a day			1
day 11 dr. @entity18 complains at me for not coming by yesterday			0
i 'm not in the mood , but do the exercises anyway , stumbling on lots of the anagrams			0
my score plummets ; elsewhere , i 'm flatlining			0
i resist the urge to stab his irritating , bouncing face with my stylus and take the brain test			0
it seems grouchiness does n't impact your score -- i 'm back down to 27			0
" hmm , a little tired , are we ? " he says			0
die , dr. @entity18 , die			0
day 14 dr. @entity18 introduces me to a new , @entity181 - style game that will , apparently , relax my brain			0
this is important too , i 'm told			0
while the music is soothing , the game has me hooked			1
but ideal before bedtime ? i 'm up playing it ' til 4 a.m. day 15 exhausted from last night 's small - hours game playing , i skip a day			1
day 16 i 've whittled my brain age down to 23 , but by accident , i leave my @entity9 on my desk -- no brain training in the evening , nor in the morning ! i start to panic			1
help ! i 'm addicted ! day 17 i time how long it takes me to do all the exercises and the brain age test			0
it 's now taking half an hour a day -- a considerable chunk of my leisure time -- and i 'm starting to resent that			1
dr. @entity18 keeps asking me to get my friends to play with me			0
" please be sure to introduce friends and family to the quick play demo , " he says			0
" share it with family and friends who want to try it out with no hassles ! " sorry @entity210 , i do n't pimp goods to my pals			0
day 18 his patronizing comments are starting to get to me			0
" do n't lose heart ! just try again tomorrow ! " he says , when my score drops			0
i want to punch him			0
day 20 and then it all goes wrong			0
i stumble with the stylus and mess up the memory test			0
my brain age plummets to 37			0
i ca n't end like that ! day 21 the final day of my three week experiment			0
can i redeem myself ? i 'm revved up for the tests and my brain age tumbles to 22 -- just two away from a perfect 20 ! but dr. @entity18 seems less impressed			0
" your brain seems fairly young , " he says			0
" but with regular training , you can sharpen that brain even more ! " is he never satisfied ? i lost 15 years in a day ! perhaps i should n't have taken brain training quite so seriously -- after all , it 's only a game ... and the results ? " @entity20 " was more fun than you 'd expect , and left me feeling more confident performing certain tasks , like quick - fire maths , away from the console			1
my scores quickly improved as i became used to the software and the console , then leveled out			1
the game was surprisingly addictive and monopolized my attention			0
my usually yawn - filled commute zipped by ; when i skipped a day 's training i missed it ; and , for a brief spell , my husband became a @entity10 widower			1
i was most taken aback by my strong emotional response to the game : when my scores improved , i felt jubilant ; when they dipped , i felt distraught and stupid			0
but did " @entity20 " make me smarter ? call me a cynic , but i 'm not convinced it 's anything more than a cunning ploy to get non-gamers like me hooked on @entity10 's latest little console			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			1
