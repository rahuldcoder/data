-- sure , serious - minded folks from the @entity2 on down have taken to @entity4 , the popular blogging platform that @entity6 announced it had purchased this week			1
when you host 105 million blogs , you 're bound to have all types			1
but since hitting the web in 2007 , the blogs that have emerged as hits on @entity4 have tended to be silly , snarky or both			1
photos : big acquisitions in the tech world with its quick and easy tools for posting and image - friendly layouts , @entity4 has become a natural landing spot for folks in the entertain - me - now world of the @entity12			1
@entity25 : @entity4 's @entity26 on @entity27 and dropping out of school with lots of folks giving the site a look for the first time since news of the $ 1.1 billion deal was announced , here are 10 fun @entity4 blogs you might want to check out : reasons my son is crying this one will probably resonate the most with parents who will likely recognize those moments where frustration meets hilarity			1
@entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 , started the blog to find the humor in those out - of - left field toddler meltdowns , as practiced by his sons @entity53 and @entity54			1
among the captions on his photos of weeping wee ones : " he ca n't climb into the sea lion tank			2
" " i touched his foot with my foot			2
" " we helped him put on the boots he loves to wear			2
" he 's since opened the blog up to reader submissions -- meaning there are now daughters crying , too			1
@entity68 looking at things this blog , like the @entity68 himself , is no longer active			2
but scrolling back through its hundreds of photos is still pretty hilarious			2
say what you will about his anti-west rhetoric and dictatorial tendencies			2
@entity68 knew how to rock a pair of giant sunglasses			2
and he loved looking at things			2
among the @entity83 propaganda shots are images of @entity68 stoically examining such items as fish , snack food , pizza dough , soy sauce and a juice box			2
" why is it so funny ? " wrote @entity91 , who ran the blog from @entity93 , @entity94			2
" i have no idea either			2
" once you 've inspected @entity68 's inspections , do n't give up hope			1
as a self - described " shameless knock - off " shows , his successor , @entity100 , likes to look at things too			0
how do i put this gently ? even if you do n't follow the blog , you 've probably seen some of its posts crop up on @entity109 , @entity110 and other sites			0
@entity4 probably played the biggest role on the internet in reviving the animated @entity114 -- those looping snippets of video that , when done right , are strangely entrancing			1
this one takes scenes from movies and tv and uses them to describe everyday situations			0
humans of @entity48 if most of these are silly , @entity123 is captivating and , at times , poignant			1
in 2010 , having just lost his job in finance , @entity126 set out to create a sort of photographic census of @entity48			1
three years later , he 's approached more than 10,000 people , taken 5,000 photos and , in the process , showcased the diversity of a city and a world			1
he interviews each subject and usually captions the photos with a choice quote or detail from that interview			0
actresses without teeth it 's actresses			1
( warning : once these images are seen , they can not be unseen			0
) literally unbelievable ok , folks			0
" @entity150 , " according to @entity151 , means " in a literal sense or manner ; actually			0
" so when you say something is literally unbelievable , it means no one should believe it			0
if only some folks on @entity109 could take their own advice			0
this blog rounds up public @entity109 posts in which people share articles from @entity165 , a satire site , thinking they 're real			0
its name comes from one reaction to " news " of @entity171 's " $ 8 billion @entity165 , " complete with coffee shops , bars and a 10 - screen movie theater			1
" my favorite posts are the ones that express complete shock but not an ounce of doubt , " @entity176 told @entity0 in 2011			0
" ' i ca n't believe this ! ' is a pretty funny response to something you should not believe			0
" @entity186 of @entity187 " they have more money than you , and this is what they do			0
" this round - up of shots from the @entity109 - owned photo app is enough to get even the biggest supply - side economist a little steamed			1
posing in front of their yachts			0
showing off their birthday - present porsches or sipping @entity203 through a straw			0
each of those , and so much more , is on display for all the propaganda your class - warfare inclinations will ever need			0
awesome people hanging out together if you want to see famous people on the @entity215 , there are millions of places to find them			0
but there 's something cool about the often - surprising meetings chronicled here that makes you wish you could be listening in			1
like president @entity222 kicking a soccer ball with @entity224			0
or @entity225 listening to @entity226 warm up			0
or @entity0 's own @entity228 cooking something with a lot of tentacles while a horrified @entity231 watches			1
from vintage images to glossy publicity shots , these are guaranteed to draw you in			0
@entity235 a new entry to the @entity4 - scape , this one highlights , without words , an issue @entity236 will face while pushing its innovative new piece of wearable tech. if you looked a little dorky before , you 'll look a lot dorky with these things strapped around your head			1
@entity248 's @entity247 who among us has never wanted to color a picture of @entity253 ? or do a connect - the - dots to put a crown on the @entity257 's head ? or pencil their way through a maze to help @entity262 find the @entity264 bathroom ( to get busy , obviously )			1
almost all of us , i 'm betting			0
but that 's what you get on this @entity4 , from the wonderfully twisted mind of rapper @entity248 the mashup of childhood memories and hip - hop stars does n't make any sense			1
which , in its way , makes perfect sense			0
in other words , it 's perfect for @entity4 .			1

on @entity4 , the random and humorous win the day
top blogs include pictures of kids crying for silly reasons , actresses with no teeth
" @entity123 " is more poignant , creating a sort of photo census
then there 's a coloring and activity book -- of rappers
