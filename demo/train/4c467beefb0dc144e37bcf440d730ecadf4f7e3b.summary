@entity0 , @entity1 -- i do n't think that anyone can prepare you for @entity0			1
from the moment of the @entity8 at twelve noon on the 6th of july to the closing ceremonies at midnight on the 14th there is no other celebration like it in the world			0
certainly many have tried to describe what goes on during the @entity14 , including of course my grandfather @entity21 in his novel " @entity14 , " but if you really want an idea of what it 's all about then you 've got to go there and see it for yourself			1
which , of course , is exactly what @entity21 did in 1923			1
he had first heard about it from @entity27 , one of his literary mentors and a woman who had piqued his curiosity with her tales of the @entity34 origins of bullfighting			0
nothing was ever as it seemed , she told her star student and the @entity39 , or bullfight , represented for some the wedding gift of the groom to the bride , wherein the bull symbolically was the man and the torero the woman			1
their fight was a ballet , she explained , and only when the bullfighter went over the animal 's horns and placed his sword perfectly into the morrillo ( the large muscle on the back of the bull 's neck ) , pushing it down into the heart and killing it instantly , was there a union between the two and a consummation of their love			0
she knew my grandfather well and probably thought , where else in @entity68 could a war veteran go and expect to find the same danger and exhilaration that comes from living on the edge , the same camaraderie and apparent contradictions that @entity21 had seen on the @entity75 front in @entity76 in 1918 ? only in @entity1 -- and specifically in @entity0 , where the townspeople gave any man the opportunity to risk his life every morning running in front of a herd of six @entity83 -- would my grandfather find what he truly needed			1
he came to the @entity14 a total of nine times , most of them in the 1920s and the last two in 1953 , a year before he won the @entity90 and in 1959 , two years before he died			2
now while i 'd advise anyone to read my grandfather 's works to have a more intimate idea of the kind of person he was , if for no other reason than because being a writer myself , i understand how important it was for him to write every day and to write as well as he could , i also know that his many visits to @entity0 were just as much a measure of the man			1
they were as important as his writing was , but for other reasons			0
here he could let himself go			0
here he did n't have to worry about the blank page , or the flow of his words or maintaining that furious energy that any writer needs to create something that is powerful and sublime			0
no , during the @entity14 he was surrounded by friends and was reminded every day that " you do n't own it			2
" that nothing is permanent and that everything is ephemeral and passing , including the people that you meet and the moments that you share			0
most everything that he did back then and that in fact people still do today was spontaneous and unplanned			0
" @entity130 " they like to say in @entity0 , the party is in the streets			2
this is what you learn when you come here and what i understood immediately in 2008 when i came here for the first time			0
it brought me closer to my grandfather and made me appreciate him more as a man and as an artist			1
if he could embrace this chaos and see it for what it was ( life itself ) and understand the need for this modern day bacchanalia then i could too			0
" you do n't own it , " i could almost hear him say , and you never do but you can face your fears and the unexpected like a man and run in front of the bulls as fast as your legs will carry you until you 're either pushed aside , knocked down , gored or worse			1
that 's the beauty of @entity0 , it gives you the chance to experience something that perhaps you 've never experienced before , to finally be creative with your own life			1

@entity21 described the bull - running *fiesta* in his novel " @entity14 "
his grandson @entity165 says only in @entity0 can a man risk life running in front of six @entity83
@entity165 : coming to @entity0 made me appreciate @entity21 more as a man and as an artist
here you must run until you 're either pushed aside , knocked down , gored or worse
