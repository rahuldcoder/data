so does @entity4 columnist @entity3			0
even conservative kingpin @entity5 has something in common with the thousands of protesters flooding @entity9 streets with anger over the grand jury decision in the @entity13 case			1
they all think the grand jury got it wrong			2
it was enough for the satirists at @entity19 's " @entity18 " to poke a little fun at civil rights icon @entity21 , who has found his world suddenly turned topsy - turvy will all the new allies in the @entity13 case			1
" what the hell is going on ? " an actor portraying @entity21 said on saturday 's program			0
" last night i was sitting in front of my tv , and i found myself saying , ' you damn right , @entity0			0
' i 'm all messed up ! " and it 's not just @entity0			0
in contrast with another high - profile case involving brutality complaints against police -- the shooting death of @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42 -- a solid majority of @entity44 disagree with the @entity46 grand jury that declined to charge officer @entity47 in @entity13 's death , according to a @entity50 poll released sunday			1
' @entity51 ' gets underway according to the poll , 60 % of @entity44 feel the grand jury made the wrong decision			1
twenty - five percent of respondents said they agreed with the decision			2
the backlash -- both from conservative commentators and the public -- is different from the reaction to the recent grand jury decision to forgo charges against the white police officer who shot and killed @entity40 , a much more widely reported incident			1
in that case , a majority of @entity44 agreed with the grand jury , although opinions were split firmly along racial , and often political lines			1
according to the @entity50 poll , 52 % of @entity44 -- including 64 % of whites -- sided with the grand jury 's findings			2
thirty - six percent disagreed , including 78 % of @entity9 respondents to the poll , which was conducted december 3 to december 5 and has a margin of error of three percentage points			0
a @entity2 / @entity80 poll found similar divisions in the @entity41 case			2
in that poll -- conducted before the grand jury decision was announced -- 54 % of non-whites said @entity41 police officer @entity87 should be charged with murder			1
among whites , 23 % shared the same feeling			0
@entity4 writer @entity91 said the poll results in the @entity13 case show it is " the turning point @entity41 never was			1
" " in the @entity13 case , there is a video , leading to less debate about the particulars of precisely what happened , " @entity91 wrote in a piece published monday			1
" as this poll shows , that is much more conducive to building consensus			0
and when it comes to taking action in response -- action of any kind -- that kind of bipartisan and biracial consensus makes it significantly more likely , " he wrote			0
not so fast , said @entity112 , a political science professor at @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115			1
" acknowledging something is wrong is not the same as doing something about it , " he said			0
he said conservative pundits who have " cherry picked " the @entity13 case are n't likely to stand arm - in - arm with protesters demanding reforms			1
but what of the poll results showing more @entity44 take issue with the @entity13 decision ? that 's where @entity112 sees change coming , but not with @entity13 's death as the catalyst			2
political and demographic changes have been driving those changes for years , @entity112 said , ever since the @entity136 case roiled @entity137 and the nation after police officers were taped beating @entity136 as he rolled in agony on a @entity137 street following a high - speed chase			2
trust in police has fallen in recent years , he said , citing poll results that particularly show a decline in trust among african - americans			0
meanwhile , the country has become more diverse			0
those changes will eventually force a change in how police do their work , @entity112 said			0
what the @entity13 case could do , he said , is move the national conversation past what some consider to be the overly simplistic suggestion that police body cameras will solve everything			1
" the changes we 're going to see now , if there are any , are going to have to be much more substantive and much more on the ground , " he said .			0

polling , pundit reactions , suggest outrage over @entity13 case is *widespread*
conservative icons join protesters in *criticizing* grand jury decision
but political science professor says he does n't think that means the case is a *watershed*
