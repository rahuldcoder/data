-- @entity1 started shopping for health insurance as soon as the @entity4 insurance marketplaces opened on october 1			1
the @entity6 resident is like a lot @entity8 citizens who have not had access to affordable health insurance in the past			1
if @entity1 , 47 , had been able to legally marry , he would have immediately been eligible for coverage under his partner , @entity15 's , policy			2
@entity15 has domestic partnership benefits at work , but the couple have n't lived together long enough to qualify for them			2
" i 'm a diabetic , so i do want to make sure i 'm covered , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 says he is n't the only person he knows in @entity22 's @entity8 community shopping for health insurance			1
many have turned to @entity1 , who used to work in public health , for casual advice			2
" a lot of what i 've found with these exchanges is confusing , and i 've got a ph.d. -- and experience with insurance , " @entity1 said			1
" there are many individuals who do n't have a lot of education , and these terms are completely new to them			2
" obamacare navigators help patients sign up for health as a whole the @entity8 community has less experience with insurance than the general population			1
a survey done by the @entity48 found that about a third of respondents were uninsured			1
it 's estimated some 16.3 % of the general population is uninsured			1
in honor of @entity54 on friday , @entity55 's " be out			2
get covered " campaign has launched a new @entity8 - friendly website with advice about how to navigate the insurance marketplace			1
@entity60 , who heads the program , did focus groups and surveys with several hundred @entity8 people and heard serious concerns about the current health care system			1
" we 've heard from people that health care is fundamental , " @entity60 said			1
" yet we wanted to make sure we were n't steering the community to something that would n't work for them			2
we wanted to make sure the policies in place will be inclusive of the community			2
" while the community is not monolithic , it does struggle with some particular health challenges that become much more deadly if a lack of health insurance keeps them from regular checkups			1
for instance , studies show lesbians are less likely than other women to get routine screenings that could detect cervical and breast cancer			0
a woman 's chances of surviving go up significantly if the cancers are caught early			0
men who have sex with men -- the clinical term for gay men -- account for 63 % of the estimated new hiv infections in 2010 , according to the @entity97			0
regular hiv testing could help stop the spread of the virus			0
in light of this challenge , the @entity102 administration called a meeting of @entity8 leaders in mid-september			1
nearly 200 from across the country met with the @entity108 to talk about the potential impact of @entity4			0
it also looked at what @entity8 leaders could do to spread the word			1
" the purpose of this briefing was to equip community leaders with the tools , information and resources they need to get involved and help local lgbt communities get access to quality , affordable health care , " @entity114 secretary @entity113 said			0
@entity4 " is not about politics			0
" @entity128 and healthy needed to make @entity4 mandate @entity130 worked with the administration to make sure the @entity4 law is completely lgbt inclusive			0
in years past , insurance companies were not required to allow coverage of domestic partners			1
now marketplaces will offer policies that are inclusive and domestic partnership benefits will be clearly spelled out			1
the law also prevents insurance companies from turning someone away because of their sexual orientation or gender identity			1
in @entity55 's focus groups they heard horror stories about companies turning applicants away because they did n't want to cover gay or transgender people			1
before the @entity4 , people with pre-existing conditions often could n't get coverage			1
now people with illnesses that involve ongoing treatment like @entity157 or with a chronic illness like @entity1 ' diabetes will be able to get access to health insurance			1
finally there will be no lifetime caps on coverage , which is particularly important to those who require constant checkups and who take medicine for chronic conditions			0
@entity4 open enrollment : everything you need to know preventative care like counseling for obesity , drug treatment , smoking cessation programs and mental health are mandatory for insurance companies to cover under @entity4			2
all could help the lgbt community			0
studies show lesbians and bisexual women have a higher rate of stress , smoking and obesity than the general population			1
they 're also at risk for heart disease , the no. 1 cause of death for women			0
gay men also have a high rate of stress , smoking and substance abuse , studies show			0
now with the marketplaces open , lgbt groups across the country are doing their bit to spread the word			1
many have received grants and special training to help with this process			0
open enrollment for the @entity4 insurance marketplaces runs through march 31			1
but to get covered by january 1 -- the deadline for everyone in the country to have insurance -- you must pay for a policy by december 15			2
people with lower incomes will get subsidies or tax breaks to buy them if they shop through the @entity4 marketplaces			1
in some states they may also qualify for @entity219 , which some chose to expand			0
@entity220 , director of health policy research at the @entity222 in @entity223 that focuses on @entity8 health , says it will continue to spread the word about the @entity4 marketplaces			1
" there are barriers that will finally be done away with in january ; it 's a great thing , " @entity220 said			0
" we really want to take advantage of the @entity4 and get the number of insured up and get our access to care numbers up , or at least on par with what the straight community experiences			2
there are so many opportunities here			0
" doctor shortage , increased demand could crash health care unemployed since june , @entity1 is covered by @entity244 insurance , but it comes with a steep price tag of a couple hundred dollars a month			2
" i 'm starting to realize just how good my policy was through work , " @entity1 said			0
" i used to only pay $ 26 a month , now next to my mortgage this is the biggest bill i have			0
" @entity1 says he will continue shopping around for the policy that will work best for him			0
he said the system crashed a couple of times when he was looking at it , but the navigators he called were nice			0
they , too , struggled to help , since their computers also kept crashing			0
@entity1 says he is undeterred			0
" i 'm pretty optimistic it will work , " @entity1 said			0
" and i will feel better knowing that i 'm covered			0
