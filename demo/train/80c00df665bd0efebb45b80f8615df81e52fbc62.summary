-- " voluntourism is not about martyrdom , " says @entity1 , ceo of @entity2 , a @entity3 - based company that arranges high - end excursions that incorporate volunteering			2
" it 's about making a difference , even if you 're staying at a luxury hotel			2
" a visitor traveling with @entity12 meets a group of young @entity14 in @entity15			1
with a growing number of hotels and tour operators offering trips that give back , the experience is more accessible than ever -- from stints building houses with @entity23 and four - week @entity25 awareness programs in @entity26 with the @entity27 to helping orphaned children in @entity14 with @entity12			1
but the key to a successful volunteer vacation involves a few basic considerations : what kind of an impact are you looking to have ? how will the project you choose benefit the local community ? ( the latter is of particular concern , since less reputable charities and companies that overstate responsible - travel claims are all too common			1
) " the most efficient and reputable organizations are those whose ultimate goal is to help communities work independently , " says @entity43 , president of @entity44 , in @entity45 , @entity46			1
travelers who would prefer a relatively simple , low - key project , such as conducting a wildlife survey in @entity54 , can opt for a hotel program			2
for a longer trip that involves daily contact with locals , a tour operator or nonprofit may be your best bet			2
to help you decide where to start , we 've outlined what to watch for , and how to continue to make an impact after you return home			2
@entity0 : 10 tips for traveling green hotels and travel companies with outreach programs if you 'd rather devote only part of your vacation to a cause , there are other , less demanding ways to give			2
check out the many philanthropic programs offered by hotels ( both high - end and chain brands ) and travel companies , including opportunities for guests to volunteer			2
according to the @entity88 , a @entity89 - based nonprofit , more than 66 percent of @entity87 travelers believe that hotels have an obligation to protect the environment and support local communities			1
the concept is n't entirely new -- eco-lodge @entity96 in @entity54 , for example , has offered travelers the chance to volunteer for almost a decade			0
@entity0 : best new green hotels @entity99 recently launched @entity100 ( givebackgetaways.com ) , a program that invites guests at 62 properties to help with projects ranging from research at @entity107 's @entity106 to river cleanups			1
@entity109 ( @entity111 / environment ) and @entity112 ( giveandgetaway.com ) have also instituted outreach programs at properties worldwide			1
booking advice : make sure the fees fall into the right pockets when a trip requires that you pay to volunteer			0
before signing up , ask your hotel what percentage of your money goes directly to the local community ( rather than to the hotel 's balance sheet )			1
many hotels will exchange philanthropic work for reduced room rates ; on select dates , for example , the @entity112 in @entity46 offer discounts to guests who volunteer at national forests within the state			0
responsible tour operators unlike hotels , travel companies have no universal third - party eco-certification			0
as a result , a tour operator might offset 100 percent of its carbon emissions for clients ' airline travel , but place them in a lodge that dumps untreated wastewater into local rivers			1
to assess how responsible a company actually is , @entity151 , cofounder of the @entity152 in @entity89 , suggests starting with some simple questions : what are the company 's environmental practices ? does it give a portion of its profits to charity ? ( @entity163 - based @entity12 , for instance , pays the administrative costs of its nonprofit @entity165 , so 100 percent of donations made go directly to the community			1
) what kinds of projects do they fund ? what does the company do to help guests understand local development and conservation issues ? also , look at online message boards , such as @entity179 's @entity178 ( @entity180 ) and tripadvisor.com , for trip reviews			1
or vet potential operators at @entity44 ( sustainabletravelinternational.org ) , @entity185 ( @entity186 ) , travelphilanthropy.org and @entity188 's multipurpose green site , eco.orbitz.com			0
finally , consider checking bona fides with a third - party auditor such as @entity192 ( greenglobe21.com ) or @entity193 ( greenleaf.org )			0
booking advice : smaller tour groups and hotels ( think 20 versus 100 people , and boutique hotels versus megaresorts ) have a lower ecological impact			0
reputable charities after returning from a vacation , you may be moved to continue to help fund a project in the destination you 've visited			0
if you 're not careful , however , your money may not end up in the right place			0
vet the charity through watchdog groups such as charitynavigator.org , @entity212 ( give.org ) and the @entity214 ( charitywatch.org )			0
these organizations rate nonprofits based on such factors as availability of financial and operational information to the public , efficiency of fund - raising activities and how donations are spent			0
many international aid organizations have regional or national partners that can use your support -- @entity229 , for example , allies itself with a number of local ngo 's in destinations in the @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235			1
also , consider charities that will allow you to make targeted donations			0
at globalgiving.org , travelers can search for projects by area , while @entity243 enables individuals to make microfinance loans in communities around the world			1
targeting your donation : rather than giving a small amount to each of several charities , donate to one or two organizations to ensure the highest impact			0
ask whether your tour company or hotel has a practice of contributing to local causes			1
@entity259 ( abercrombiekent.com ) , @entity260 ( sixsenses.com ) , @entity261 ( ccafrica.com ) , @entity262 ( intrepidtravel.com ) and @entity263 ( expeditions.com ) all sponsor nonprofits that work in destinations abroad			0
