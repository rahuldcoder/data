-- when temperatures start to dip to uncomfortable lows at night , there are always calls from charities to donate blankets and warm clothes for homeless people			1
some @entity8 came up with less predictable ways to help their fellow humans and make a creative impact in the lives of those less fortunate			1
@entity15 , for example , wondered if she could help the homeless with origami			1
she was exploring the principles of this ancient paper - folding art at the @entity20 when she envisioned a way to provide a portable shelter for the people she saw at night sleeping out on the pavement			1
after working through many iterations of the design , @entity15 developed an accordion - like shelter she calls " @entity29			1
" because of the origami design , the folding mechanism increases the sturdiness and structural integrity of the cardboard			0
this also allows it to be folded flat and easily carried by one person			0
watch @entity15 unfold her " @entity29 , " on @entity38 @entity15 knows " @entity29 " is not a permanent solution , but she hopes it can be a transition to something better			0
" sometimes people just need a moment out of the elements , a moment to rest and prepare for the next day			0
" " it has been very inspiring , hearing from people around the world who are interested in my design , " says @entity15 , who is creating a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit organization to help get the folded homes on the streets			0
for guidance and motivation , @entity15 turned to the team at " @entity57 , " a pioneering nonprofit group that provides portable shelters for homeless people in @entity61 , @entity62			1
the group 's @entity63 , a four - wheel pushcart that transforms into a shelter , offers secure storage of belongings during the day			1
at night , it unfolds into a one - person raised tent , providing privacy and protection from the elements			0
ireporter @entity73 , @entity63 program coordinator , sees an added benefit to portable shelters			1
she said that although 140 @entity79 are in use , with another 50 being manufactured , the greatest measure of the units ' success is the fact that one has already been returned			0
one woman is no longer in need of the @entity63 because she curbed her drug habit and moved into transitional housing			0
" it was experiencing her own bed , her own place to stay , " in the @entity63 , said @entity73 , " that made her remember the life she could have			0
" see photos of the edar in action , on @entity38 @entity94 filed an @entity38 about helping homeless people with the law			1
he provides free legal services in @entity98 , @entity99 , shelters , with the organization @entity101			1
he said there is a growing need for legal assistance with housing issues			1
" there are more and more questions on foreclosures , property rights and mortgage law " said @entity94 , who said this now accounts for up to a quarter of the legal inquiries he receives at the shelters			2
@entity94 said he helps many people still living in their foreclosed home			0
" they are desperate , knowing that on any day they will be kicked out			0
some of these people have already lost their home and just do n't know where to go or what to do , " @entity94 said			0
he said if he can help keep the roof over just one family , it will take the strain off the homeless shelters , which are already overcrowded			2
@entity94 with his legal team at the @entity127 , on @entity38 @entity128 , executive director for the @entity129 , is pleased to hear that individuals losing their homes are consulting lawyers			2
" many of these people were not entering into the conversations with lawyers or bankers about viable options other than foreclosure			2
" said @entity128 , who has seen the added pressure the housing crisis has placed on the homeless population			2
" this economy and the lack of employment have increased the number of homeless , and the second tier effect would be from foreclosures , which in turn is making rental property scarce			2
he is concerned about those that find themselves without a place to stay			2
" @entity157 's homeless shelter system is called the last safety net , and this net is beginning to fray			1
" have you helped make a positive change in the lives of those who need shelter ? share your story with @entity38 and @entity167 .			0
