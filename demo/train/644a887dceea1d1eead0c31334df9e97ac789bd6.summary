@entity0 -- @entity2 started as an experiment in convergence and somehow , miraculously , has morphed into a source of fascination , inspiration and learning for millions of curious souls all over the world			1
i showed up at @entity2 for the first time 11 years ago and was exhilarated to find myself among people turned on by cool ideas			1
geeks , designers , entrepreneurs , scientists , global activists -- viewed one way , they could n't have been more different			1
but everyone was curious ; everyone wanted to dig below the surface and have a real conversation about stuff that mattered			2
i fell in love with the event so badly that within a year , i 'd set my heart on acquiring it			2
it was the kind of thing you could devote a life to			0
through a complicated series of events , i was able to do this in 2001 and transfer it into a not - for - profit foundation with the mission " ideas worth spreading			1
" that 's made it natural for @entity2 to gradually transition from being an exclusive club to a global community that anyone can participate in			1
the key step was our decision three years ago to start posting the conference talks online for anyone to see for free			1
far from robbing the conference of its crown jewels , the move has been transformative , both for @entity2 and for some of the speakers who have achieved an unexpected new form of celebrity			1
with audiences in the millions , they are helping redefine what it is to be a great teacher			0
it is thrilling to imagine them delivering insight and inspiration to knowledge - seekers old and young , rich and poor , in every corner of the planet			0
@entity2 was founded in 1984 by information architect @entity69 and his partners			1
they saw that the industries of @entity75 -- the @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- were converging and that an event covering all three could be uniquely interesting			0
the first @entity2 showcased the brand - new @entity79 and strange round silver shiny discs , the first cds. the program generated huge excitement , but it was a commercial failure , five years later , @entity69 tried again , and since then it 's been held annually in @entity85 , with a growing number of spin - off events in other locations			1
but a strange thing happened over the years			0
the content of the conference became ever broader , incorporating scientists , business leaders , novelists , social entrepreneurs and movers and shakers of all stripes			1
we now seek out literally anyone who is remarkable from any discipline , provided they can find a way of powerfully sharing their passion with a general audience			2
here 's why this works			0
our world has gotten more complicated than ever			0
and most issues simply can not be understood by looking at them through a single lens			0
in the world 's race to specialize , we forgot that actually all knowledge is connected			0
take the current economic crisis			0
the bankers and economists and politicians are largely stumped			0
to fight our way through this may well require ideas from much wider sources -- perhaps from systems architects and evolutionary psychologists , or from researchers dreaming up new energy sources or philosophers or activists questioning our basic priorities			2
policies and politicians come and go , but great ideas last forever			2
and we live in an age where they can spread faster than ever			2
but there 's something else strange about @entity2			1
it turns out that if you spend a few days opening yourself to brilliance from multiple sources , not just intellectual but also aesthetic , something remarkable happens			2
you end up getting seized by a sense of possibility , excitement -- inspiration , even			0
since taking over at @entity2 , i 've been trying to figure out what that means and what can be done with it			1
one of our attempted answers is the @entity155			1
each year , we grant this award to three individuals with world - changing potential			0
they get $ 100,000 ... but more important , they are granted a wish under the following terms : " no restrictions			1
" at @entity2 , they reveal their wishes to an audience ready to be inspired			1
this has led to a series of thrilling collaborative projects ( they 're documented at tedprize.org )			0
this year has seen another surprising development in which tens of thousands of people around the world have gathered in more than 300 self - organized @entity2 - like events			1
we call this program @entity178 ( see @entity179 )			0
@entity178 events have been held in 50 countries , in schools , companies , campuses and theaters			0
they range in scale from 1,200 college kids in @entity189 , @entity85 , to a tiny battered church in the middle of @entity193 's largest slum			0
the passion being put into these events is astonishing and proves a global interest in this new way of sharing knowledge and reawakening wonder			2
how big could this get ? well , it depends on how many people are out there with a passion to learn and a willingness to help shape a better future			1
certainly , @entity1 's partnership is a big step forward for us , giving @entity2 exposure to a vast global audience hungry for knowledge that matters			1
tedtalks are n't usually about the story of the day			0
but the ideas they communicate will help shape the stories of tomorrow			2
watch with an open mind ... and let your curiosity take you on a thrilling journey of discovery ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

curator says @entity2 allows remarkable people to share ideas with global community
posting conference talks online has helped spread message , he says
