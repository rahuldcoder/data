even getting used to the hooks did n't seem difficult , @entity12 said			1
" it 's interesting ... after having those hooks on for about 10 minutes she seemed to be able to master the ability to use them , " he said , adding that she was able to pick up a pair of shorts she had on her wheelchair at the rehabilitation facility and threw them across her body			2
" the prosthetist looked at that and said , ' wow , it usually takes three days for somebody to be able to master the coordination of using those hooks to be able to do something like that			0
' " @entity12 's ordeal began may 1 when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the @entity44 , about 50 miles west of @entity45			1

" a number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to necrotizing fasciitis , or flesh - eating bacteria syndrome			2
