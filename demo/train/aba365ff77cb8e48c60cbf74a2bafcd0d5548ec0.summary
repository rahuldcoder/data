-- the best jockey in @entity2 , if not the world , is talking about a sport close to his heart -- baseball			1
for a man who has just scooped the most prestigious horse race in the @entity2 -- the @entity9 -- @entity10 seems almost reluctant to talk about life on the track			1
but get him onto baseball , and it 's a whole other ball game for the all - conquering rider from the @entity16 -- a @entity18 island nation that has just one racing venue			1
" i like to be a jockey			0
but i love baseball , " the softly spoken 28 - year - old told @entity0			2
" growing up i played a lot of baseball			0
but i was small and did n't weigh much			0
my family thought maybe i could be a jockey , so when i was 12 my half - brother took me to a jockey school			2
" small stature , giddy heights fast forward 15 years and @entity10 is now one of the most successful jockeys on the planet , in the space of just five weeks winning titles his counterparts spend a lifetime chasing			1
the @entity36 , who moved to the @entity2 when he was 20 , was catapulted to international stardom in march after winning the world 's richest race , the $ 10 million @entity42 , atop thoroughbred @entity41			1
weeks later he was kissing another coveted trophy , the @entity9 , after conquering the mud - splattered @entity46 race course on three - year - old colt , @entity49			1
notching up almost $ 14 million in prize money this year alone , @entity10 has finished in the top three places in a remarkable 57 % of his races			1
" there 's no doubt he 's the best jockey in the @entity2 today , " said jockey agent @entity53 , who has been in the business 40 years and worked with such riding legends as @entity56			1
" he 's one of those riders that only comes along every 25 years			2
he 's so tremendously strong and has so much in rhythm with the horse -- it 's almost like an instinct			0
" @entity66 dreams a jockey has n't won @entity2 's prestigious @entity66 -- which includes the @entity9 , @entity68 and @entity69 -- in over a decade			1
@entity10 may be just the man to break that drought			2
after scooping @entity9 -- the first race in the @entity66 -- earlier this month , the hype surrounding him has reached a deafening pitch			1
this saturday all eyes will be on @entity10 and wonder horse @entity49 as they attempt to take the second race in the coveted treble -- the @entity68			1
they are the bookmakers ' favorites to win , but @entity10 remains a calm island in the middle of the media storm			2
" the @entity66 is the biggest achievement in @entity2 horse racing and just to win the first race is something very special to me , " he said			1
" am i going to win on saturday ? i 'm not sure			0
but i 'm confident racing , and my horse has a good chance			0
" cool , calm , collected " good chance " is an understatement			0
but it 's also indicative of @entity10 's remarkably relaxed attitude to racing			2
while other jockeys wake at dawn and spend entire days at the stables , @entity10 prefers to play his beloved baseball or golf in the afternoons			2
the country 's top earning jockey usually wakes around 7 a.m. , trains for a few hours , races , and plays sport with his friends when he can			1
" he 's a very humble person , he does n't think the sport revolves him , " said @entity53			0
" anyone who does something 365 days a year might not be quite as good as they 'd like			0
this is a different mindset -- it 's about trying to keep fresh and excited about racing			0
" ball games that 's not to say @entity10 has n't worked hard to get where he is			1
but you get the feeling that if he 'd had been just that little bit taller , he would have chosen professional baseball instead of the track			0
" every boy in the @entity16 plays baseball			2
and everyone thinks they 're going to play professionally , " said @entity53			0
" they play it every day of the year			0
they get out of school and play it until it gets dark			0
so baseball is really embedded in the national psyche			0
" growing up on a farm , @entity10 was just five years old when he started riding horses			2
but it was n't until he started jockey school that he first laid eyes on the country 's one and only race track			1
once he did , he was focused on success , moving to @entity142 and working his way up to the top circuits			0
today he is the only jockey from the @entity16 to win the @entity9 -- doing so just weeks after his nation also won the @entity147			1
now it seems that for the very first time , the country 's most famous sports star may not be from the ball park after all .			0
