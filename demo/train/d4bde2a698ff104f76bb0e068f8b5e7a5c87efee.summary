-- all @entity2 rock stars eventually make their version of " @entity4 " -- the album where they look to the history and mythology of @entity7 for inspiration			0
usually , this means pastoral celebrations and druids dancing around the maypole			0
( @entity13 , minstrel ! is that a bustle in the hedgerow ? ) but @entity17 , as always , does things her own way , so there 's no celebration on " @entity22			2
" even as she sings , " take me back to beautiful @entity7 , " she focuses on war , imperialism and bad sanitation			0
" @entity22 " sounds a world apart from the introspective piano confessions of @entity29 's last solo album , 2007 's " @entity28			1
" for @entity7 , she holed up in a rural 19th - century church , accompanied by longtime collaborators like @entity32 , @entity29 and producer @entity33			1
the sound is muted guitar / organ balladry , heavy on melody but never rocking out , channeling her voice through different electronic filters for that extra touch of spooky alienation			1
in " @entity41 , " she sings about @entity45 's " gray , damp filthiness of ages			0
" click to listen to @entity17 's " @entity22 " always an underrated guitarist , @entity29 makes use of the jaunty rhythms of @entity2 folk music , but takes no comfort in the past			1
and you do n't have to care about @entity7 history -- or @entity7 in general -- to fall under @entity29 's spell			2
