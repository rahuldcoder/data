@entity0 -- if there 's a contest for worst travel experience of the year , @entity2 might be in the running			1
the plane departed @entity8 on sunday for a 13 - hour trip to @entity10			1
but most of the 262 passengers did n't get to @entity13 until tuesday evening -- three days late -- after an unplanned and prolonged layover in @entity15 , @entity16			0
about three hours into the flight , the @entity2 jetliner was diverted to @entity15 because of broken bathrooms			1
when a replacement plane arrived monday , it also was grounded because of mechanical problems , prompting most of the passengers to catch a third plane tuesday			1
" it was just one thing after the other , " said @entity25 , who was on a business trip from @entity27			0
" it was honestly unbelievable			0
we could n't believe it			0
it definitely was the flight from hell			2
" @entity2 shows the impact -- and limits -- of the @entity36 , designed to protect passengers from being held on tarmac - bound jets			1
in this instance , @entity2 appeared to go to great lengths to avoid violating the tarmac rule , which fines airlines if they keep passengers on ground - bound planes more than four hours , with some exceptions			1
but a string of delays and mechanical problems plagued the voyage almost from the very beginning			1
passengers said the the flight left @entity8 at 2 p.m. sunday , and the first inkling of trouble came three hours later , when the pilot announced a detour to @entity15 because of problems with several of the @entity60 's lavatories			1
according to @entity25 , the captain announced , " you may have noticed some lavatories are n't working			2
we 're making an unplanned stop in @entity15			0
" when the plane landed , @entity25 said , the passengers sat for an hour and a half before they were allowed to get off and wait in a secure area			2
that wait lasted about four hours , @entity25 said , before they got word that the flight was canceled and that a replacement plane would arrive the next day			1
" they told us to wait in line and get our meal and hotel vouchers			2
but it just took them hours and hours to make that announcement , and there was only one guy handing out the vouchers , " @entity25 said			0
" and they were checking us off one - by - one , so it took like 10 minutes per person to get your voucher , and there was like 280 of us , i believe			2
" when all was said and done , passengers got one $ 12 meal voucher , @entity25 said			1
@entity25 said she was issued her hotel voucher shortly after midnight , and the airline refused to release people 's luggage , which contained clothing and medication			2
the bad luck continued monday			0
when passengers arrived at 11 a.m. for the 1 p.m. flight , they were informed that the flight had been delayed 2Â½ hours , @entity25 said			0
once on the second plane , they waited a couple more hours before the captain made an announcement			0
" they announced that that plane also has broke down , " @entity25 said			2
" the captain acknowledged that it was ironic , which is one way to put it			0
" passengers were told that another replacement plane would arrive tuesday			1
@entity25 said she opted to catch a red - eye plane back			0
for several dozen passengers who opted to take that overnight flight to @entity8 , there was added drama when lightning harmlessly struck their plane			1
in a statement wednesday , @entity2 said it provided its customers with hotel accommodations and meal options and provided a different @entity60 aircraft			1
it made no mention of that aircraft 's mechanical problems			1
" we sincerely apologize to our customers for the delays and are fully refunding their tickets			0
we are also actively reaching out to our customers to offer additional compensation , " the statement read			2
a @entity139 spokesman said wednesday that the agency had received one complaint			0
" we sent the complaint to @entity2 and asked them to reply to the passenger , " @entity142 said			1
meanwhile , @entity25 says she still does n't have her luggage			0
" the luggage is in @entity13			0
hopefully , i 'll get it back , " she said .			0

flight from @entity8 to @entity10 landed after lavatories broke

passenger says she got one $ 12 meal voucher but not her luggage
