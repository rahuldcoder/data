-- start - ups are fighting a war for talent in @entity4 , and the companies that actively welcome men and women are going to win it			1
smart companies do n't recruit " brogrammers			1
" the term brogrammer is a joke , of course			2
male software engineers do n't actually pop their collars , wear sunglasses and lift weights while writing code and share hot tubs with bikini - clad women			2
but the joke is funny for some people because it reflects a truth about a community where certain places exclude great talent in favor of frat house fun			1
the tech industry 's testosterone level can make the thickest - skinned women consider a different career			1
but the rise of the brogrammer joke and its ensuing backlash has some benefits : it helps talented women choose worthy employers , it gives a name and face to a problem that plagues the industry and it publicly shames some of the most sexist offenders			1
in 1999 , @entity45 's @entity44 almost did n't take the job at the all - male start - up because there were more women at another firm that made her an offer			1
if @entity52 had just graduated from college today with offers from two equally compelling start - ups -- one all - male and one not -- it 's clear which one she would choose			1
if you write software for a living and you 're located in @entity4 , you have your pick of employment options at an array of tech start - ups -- yes , even in this economy			1
when a recruiter 's pitch is : " @entity65 and crush some code ? " -- like @entity70 - based @entity69 's was -- you get a sense of what that company is looking for			2
if you 're a woman , it 's not you			0
that 's pretty sad , but it 's not all bad			2
as a woman and a software developer , crossing @entity69 off the list of places where i might work helps me narrow my options			0
i 'd rather find out that an employer glorifies young dudes before i take a position than afterward			0
that 's one small way brogrammer culture is actually useful			1
it 's a red flag for women engineers , product developers , designers , project managers , marketers , business development and pr specialists			0
it says : this is a company that you 'd want to avoid			0
conversely , companies that assemble inclusive teams are more likely to snag great hires of all stripes			1
tech start - ups founded by women are few and far between , but they 're highly attractive to female and male candidates who do n't want to join a boys ' club			1
established companies with executives who are vocal about women 's issues , such as @entity116 's @entity115 , also have an advantage			2
( @entity115 's @entity119 talk is one of my all - time favorite career advice presentations for women			2
) the spotlight on @entity4 's brogrammer problem has focused on some of the worst public offenders			1
i find sexism in 2012 corporate @entity128 appalling , but i 'm also an optimist			0
the folks perpetuating this culture are probably not overt misogynists			2
most of the time , they simply do n't know any better			0
@entity133 's @entity132 " feels terrible " about the sexist comments he made during a conference presentation that caused disgusted attendees to get up and leave			2
@entity137 began a women in technology committee after mishandling the retraction of a promotional video that featured a scantily clad female dancer			0
cynics would argue that apologies wo n't resolve the underlying problem			0
but humiliation is an effective behavior modifier			0
i do n't think these people will make these mistakes again			0
sometimes the road to enlightenment is paved with public shaming			0
and there 's a bonus : onlookers have real life examples of what not to do at their companies			0
the tech industry has always been male - dominated			1
but the perception of those men has changed			0
billionaire geeks of @entity4 are no longer considered awkward nerds who ca n't get a date			1
instead , they 're superheroes , the protagonist in epic movies and biographies			0
a new generation of young people from all walks of life aspires to be the next @entity173 , @entity174 or @entity175			0
they 'll want to work for the most attractive companies -- the ones who built welcoming , diverse teams			0
brogrammer culture celebrates frat house values , youth over experience and men over women			1
in the war for hiring great talent , the companies that embrace this culture rather than reject it will lose			1
that 's a good thing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1
