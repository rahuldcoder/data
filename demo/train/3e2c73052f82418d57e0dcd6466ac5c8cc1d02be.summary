-- after months of grinding civil war , with supporters of @entity6 slowly yielding territory to @entity9 rebels , the final battle for @entity3 's liberation unleashed an apparent bloodbath			1
@entity6 was killed after being captured last week , and the circumstances of his death remain unclear			1
@entity13 says dozens of apparent reprisal killings also occurred on both sides			1
such violence can be common in the aftermath of a long dictatorship , when desired and even cathartic revenge against oppressors competes with efforts to establish the rule of law and stability			1
is the mayhem committed with seeming impunity an unavoidable result of revolution , or does it reveal inherent instability in a society damaged by decades of unjust , corrupt and oppressive rule ? to @entity31 , a senior fellow at the @entity33 's @entity32 , the answer comes from @entity36 's communist revolutionary leader , @entity35 , who is quoted as having said : " a revolution is not a tea party			1
" " the aftermath of a very brutal dictatorship is usually very ugly , " @entity39 said tuesday			1
" of course , it would have been better if mr. @entity6 was put before a trial and held accountable for all his crimes			1
... i think it 's unrealistic to expect that 's going to happen			2
" in the chaos of a firefight surrounding the capture of such a despised tyrant , it 's not surprising that an enemy -- perhaps someone whose family suffered at the hands of the @entity6 regime -- might have decided to kill him , @entity39 added			1
" it 's not going to be a moment to read them their @entity61 rights , " he said			2
@entity6 and son buried in secret location @entity13 has called for @entity3 's governing @entity65 to investigate the killing of @entity6 and others , including 53 people found dead and perhaps summarily executed in a hotel under the control of @entity9 forces			1
such violence constitutes a war crime , the group said			0
" a failure by the @entity65 to investigate these deaths promptly and impartially , along with the many alleged war crimes by @entity6 forces , would send a dangerous message that @entity3 can take justice into their own hands , " said an @entity13 statement			1
in a statement , the @entity65 's executive office said tuesday that it " attaches great importance to the concerted efforts deployed to ensure humane treatment , in accordance with the principles of international human rights covenants , to all @entity3 and foreign prisoners and detainees			2
under the supervision of the @entity96 all cases and detention conditions will be considered and reviewed ; fair trials will be guaranteed for those suspected of committing war crimes or criminal acts			0
" opinion : @entity102 enters @entity3 , leaves @entity103 it said it had coordinated with the @entity105 , which oversees security units , " to ensure all prisoners and detainees are well treated until they are brought before the judicial authorities			0
" " we do not tolerate , and in fact we disapprove of any prisoner being hurt , let alone killed , " the @entity65 said in a statement			0
" we did not want to end this tyrant 's life before he was brought to court , and before he answered questions that have deprived @entity3 from sleep and tormented them for years			2
" history shows that in a revolution , the victor reaps the spoils , including revenge against those formerly in power			0
@entity125 had the guillotine , while modern - day despots have met less ritualized but equally inglorious ends			1
in @entity131 , the former @entity130 - backed leader @entity129 was tortured , killed and publicly hanged when the @entity132 came to power in 1996			0
another @entity130 - era dictator , @entity133 of @entity134 , was executed after a very quick trial on christmas day in 1989			0
@entity136 , who was captured by @entity102 forces in 2003 , stood trial under @entity103 's justice system and was hanged three years later , while former @entity141 strongman @entity140 died in the custody of the @entity143			0
opinion : investigate @entity6 's death as a war crime other dictators , including @entity148 of the @entity149 and @entity150 of @entity151 , managed to flee into exile			1
to @entity39 , the killing of @entity6 sends a message to autocratic rulers such as president @entity156 of @entity157 that " the day of reckoning will come , and when the day of reckoning comes , you 'd better have your tickets for a plane to exile			2
" violence at the hands of the former @entity3 rebels , now in power under the @entity65 , should not come as a surprise to anyone , he said			0
" i find it a little disingenuous for some to be saying , ' we thought these guys were the good guys , ' " @entity39 said			0
" how did you expect this was going to end ? " @entity175 , deputy director of the @entity176 , noted in an october 6 column that the brutality of the @entity6 years means " @entity3 will likely find themselves using retributive justice against certain members of the regime , particularly against those who were involved in the killing of innocent civilians			2
" " this will be difficult to avoid , " @entity175 wrote after the regime was toppled but before @entity6 's capture and killing effectively ended the fighting			1
" @entity3 are likely to want to pursue this path for the cathartic psychological impact it would have on the grieving families of the regime 's victims and the society in general			0
" while such retribution " may provide some psychological release to victims , @entity3 must realize that this is not the type of justice that will help their country move into a new era of stability , reconstruction and development , " @entity175 added			0
" indeed , @entity3 need to engage in a wide national reconciliation process that uses restorative , rather than retributive , tactics to repair broken relationships and heal deep wounds , " he wrote			0
@entity39 rejected any suggestion that @entity211 forces or the @entity102 , which spearheaded a military mission to ground @entity3 's air force and attack government forces , bore responsibility for the extra-judicial killing of @entity6 after his capture			1
president @entity219 's decision to limit @entity102 engagement and reject putting " boots on the ground " prevented any chance that foreign forces could control the situation , he said			0
" i 'm glad we did n't have boots on the ground , " @entity39 added			0
" if one of the prices of that is we had no control over the last moments of @entity6 , i think we were better off not having boots on the ground			2
" former cia director @entity235 , a retired general who contributes to @entity0 , called for @entity102 engagement with the newly liberated @entity3 to prevent a societal collapse in the aftermath of the @entity6 regime			1
" if @entity3 is left to its own devices , it is not difficult to conceive of it becoming @entity244 on the @entity245 , an ungoverned space threatening the heart of @entity248 as well as critical international lines of communication , " @entity235 wrote in a column published tuesday .			0

@entity13 calls for investigations of apparent reprisal killings
" the aftermath of a very brutal dictatorship is usually very ugly , " an *analyst* says
" a revolution is not a tea party , " @entity36 's @entity35 said
like @entity6 , other dictators also have met inglorious ends
