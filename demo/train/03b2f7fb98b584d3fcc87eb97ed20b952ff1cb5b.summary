-- have you noticed that homelessness is n't worse ? here we are , living through the most protracted joblessness crisis since the @entity5 -- and surprisingly , fewer people are living on the street			1
the federal @entity8 reported that the number of the chronically homeless declined by 30 % between 2005 and 2007			0
you might have expected the numbers to spike again when the financial crisis hit but no. since 2007 , the number of chronic homeless has dropped another 19 %			0
a broader measure of the number of homeless counts the number of people living out of doors on one randomly chosen night			1
that broader measure has also improved through the economic crisis			0
between january 2011 and january 2012 , homelessness among veterans dropped by 7 %			1
to what or whom do we owe this good news ? in very large part , we owe it to the president whose library opened in @entity32 last week : @entity33			1
for three decades , we have debated what causes homelessness and how to deal with it			2
is homelessness a mental health problem ? a substance abuse problem ? a problem caused by gentrification and urban redevelopment ? or something else again ? the @entity33 administration substituted a much simpler idea -- an idea that happened to work			1
whatever the cause of homelessness , the solution is ... a home			1
in 2002 , @entity33 appointed a new national homeless policy czar , @entity51			1
a former music agent imbued with the religious philosophy of @entity54 , @entity51 was seized by an idea pioneered by @entity57 psychiatrist @entity56 : " housing first			2
" the " housing first " concept urges authorities to concentrate resources on the hardest cases -- to move them into housing immediately -- and only to worry about the other problems of the homeless after they first have a roof over their heads			2
a 2004 profile in the @entity72 nicely summarized @entity56 ' ideas : " offer them ( the homeless ) the apartment first , he believes , and you do n't need to spend years , and service dollars , winning their trust			2
" many old school homeless advocates resisted @entity51 's approach			0
they were impelled by two main objections : 1			0
they believed that homelessness was just the most extreme form of a problem faced by low - income people generally -- a lack of affordable housing for low - income people			1
focusing resources on the nation 's hardest cases would ( these advocates feared ) distract the federal government from the bigger project of subsidizing better housing for millions of people who did not literally live in the streets			1
by 2002 , the nation had been worrying about homelessness for several decades			2
countless programs from state and local agencies responded to some separate part of the problem ; tens of thousands of people earned their livings in those state and local agencies , disposing of massive budgets			2
" @entity116 first " threatened to disrupt this vast industry			0
" @entity116 first " was comparatively cheap , for one thing : a homeless shelter might look squalid , but it cost a great deal to operate -- more , oftentimes , than a proper apartment with kitchen and bath			0
the transition to " housing first " threatened jobs and budgets across the country			0
there was only one counterargument to these objections : " @entity116 first " worked			0
it worked from the start , and it worked fast			0
it worked so well that the @entity137 administration has now claimed the approach as its own , even keeping @entity51 on the job for the first weeks of the new administration			0
@entity33 remains one of the more controversial and less popular ex-presidents			1
but if in the next days you happen to walk down a city street , take a moment to notice how many men or women are sleeping there			0
results will vary from place to place , but on average , there are probably fewer than half as many as a decade ago			0
the job is not completed yet			0
but for the first time since the 1970s , the abolition of homelessness has become a real and near possibility			1
whatever else you think of the 43rd president , that achievement is part of @entity33 's legacy , too			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

@entity165 : despite the @entity168 , fewer people are living on the street
@entity171 : why is n't homelessness getting worse ? because of the policies of @entity33
he says under @entity33 the simple solution of providing a home ( " housing first " ) worked
@entity171 : abolition of homelessness has become a real possibility , thanks to @entity33
