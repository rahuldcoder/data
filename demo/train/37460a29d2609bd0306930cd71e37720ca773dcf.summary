-- i was in a year - abroad program in 1973 , one of 240 @entity5 students attending @entity6			1
the school year was winding down			1
i went out to dinner with a group of friends in @entity11			1
after several courses and many bottles of wine , we went to a bar and listened to a singer do jazz standards			1
about 11:30 , @entity19 , a friend from @entity21 , @entity22 , and i decided to peel off from the group and take a cab across town to @entity26 , an old @entity27 haunt on @entity28			1
( we 'd sit outside , drink whiskey and talk to the prostitutes , beautiful women who walked down from the park , @entity32 , looking for a rich guy staying at one of the expensive hotels			1
) we left the bar , and i saw a taxi on the other side of the piazza under a full moon			1
walked to it , and i got in back and closed my eyes , feeling the effects of many drinks			1
i heard the front door open and close , looked and saw @entity19 grinning in the driver 's seat			1
" we 're going to @entity49 's			1
" i thought he was kidding			1
but then i heard the engine start , saw him slip the shifter in gear , and we did a couple doughnuts in the middle of the piazza , tires squealing , and pulled out , turning right onto a street heading for the @entity60			1
i said , " are you out of your mind ? " he looked at me in the rearview mirror and laughed			1
minutes later , negotiating the narrow cobblestone streets of @entity11 , we passed a @entity68 ( national police ) sedan parked on the side of the road			1
i could see the cops look at us in what seemed like slow motion			1
the next thing i remember , the taxi came to a stop			1
unlikely as it was , we were stuck in a traffic jam on the back streets of @entity80			1
i got out of the taxi and started to run , made it to the @entity60 but hesitated			1
instead of going over the wall and climbing the ladder to the riverbank , i crouched behind a car in a small parking lot and waited			1
i could feel my heart banging in my chest			2
a few minutes passed , and nothing happened			2
just as i started to relax , i saw a @entity68 patrolman appear out of the darkness , coming toward me , gun drawn , shouting something in @entity95			2
there was nowhere to go			2
i stood with my arms raised , hands over my head			2
i was handcuffed and taken to @entity68 headquarters			2
@entity19 had also been picked up , and we were reunited in an interrogation room and later were questioned by an angry @entity68 officer			2
" who are you ? " we gave him our names			2
i said , " we 're @entity5 , students at @entity6			2
" he did n't seem impressed			2
" why did you steal the taxi ? " " we had too much to drink , " @entity19 said			2
" it was a prank			2
" " this is how a man makes his living , and you dismiss it as something trivial , unimportant			2
you drink too much and use this as an excuse			2
" the @entity68 officer paused			2
" in @entity95 , you are guilty until proven innocent			2
" with that , he walked out of the room			2
from there , i was handcuffed and pushed into the back of a @entity129 sedan , flanked by two heavyset cops , and driven to the outskirts of @entity80			1
i could see the walls and towers of a prison in the distance set behind a high fence topped with razor wire			1
i said to the cop on my right , " what is that ? " " @entity143 , " he said			2
i had heard of it , @entity143 , where the hardcore criminals were sent			2
we turned into the prison complex and pulled up to a building with a silver steel garage door that reminded me of something i 'd seen in a @entity153 movie			1
the door went up , and we drove into a concrete loading area			2
the handcuffs were removed , and i was escorted to a room , photographed and fingerprinted			0
after that , i was escorted to a hall and fell in line behind the other fools who had been arrested that night , a motley crew of 20 men			0
grit on wry : a dinner with @entity166 and @entity167 i was thinking about what my mother had said before i left the country			1
we were standing on the driveway , getting ready to go to the airport			0
" @entity167 , please do n't get in trouble			1
" i said , " what do you think i 'm going to do ? " the line kept moving , and when it was my turn , i stepped up to the open half - door of a storeroom and was given a stained towel , a bar of soap and a distressed cup made out of extruded metal			1
a guard escorted me to a cell , solitary confinement , which seemed like a blessing under the circumstances			0
it was now 4:30 in the morning			0
i was exhausted and fell asleep fast			0
next thing i remember , i was in that state between sleep and waking up when your mind can play tricks on you			0
i was thinking about the events of the previous night , wondering if it was a dream , and then i opened my eyes and saw the morning sunlight coming through the barred window creating a distorted pattern on the tile floor			0
the room had a bed , an orange metal frame bolted to the wall and a stained mattress , a toilet , and scarred , graffiti - covered walls			1
a guy named @entity216 professing his love for @entity218			0
on my second day , in captivity a woman from the @entity220 visited and gave me a couple packs of @entity223 and a couple @entity225 bars			0
i said , " do you have any news from @entity228 ? " he was the director of the university			0
she did n't know who he was , which was n't a good sign			0
i had n't heard anything from @entity228 or anyone else , and i was starting to wonder			0
except for an hour in the exercise yard each day , i was locked in the 6 - by - 8 - foot cell , and i was getting anxious , on edge			1
the exercise yard , with its concrete floor and chain - link walls , looked like it had been lifted from the projects in @entity244			1
i would stand with my back to the fence , feeling the warmth of the sun. @entity248 would come up and ask if i was @entity250			0
when i told them i was an @entity5 , they assumed i had been arrested for drugs			0
" no , " i would say , " stealing a taxi			0
" and the typical response would be : " that 's not bad			1
you get eight months , maybe a year , but no more than that			0
" hearing it freaked me out			0
i thought , eight months , i 've got to get out of here			0
one afternoon in the yard , a dark - skinned guy who looked @entity263 or @entity264 tried to take my cigarettes			1
i did n't say anything , just stepped in and hit him in the face , and he went down			0
no one else bothered me after that			0
early , the morning of day four , i was taken to a holding cell where i met my court - appointed attorney , a young guy named @entity274 who did n't speak @entity275			1
i asked him to contact @entity228 and find out was going on , but i do n't think he understood			0
@entity274 represented me during the arraignment that was held in a conference room at the prison			1
a judge advocate explained the charges against me and said i would be going to trial in a few days			0
after the arraignment , i was moved to a four - man cell in general population			1
@entity19 has been moved there , too			0
our cellmates were @entity289 , a 25 - year - old pickpocket from @entity291 , and @entity292 , a 72 - year - old armed robber who had been incarcerated since @entity293 was in power			1
@entity292 was demented and slept in his clothes , thinking he was going to be released any minute			0
i spent the next three days reading crime fiction from the prison library and thinking some day i would use the @entity143 experience in a novel			1
on day seven , i was escorted to a large holding cell filled with prisoners , most of whom were throwing salt over their left shoulder for good luck before going to court			0
@entity19 appeared a little later , handcuffed to a thin , frightened @entity95			0
i was handcuffed to a little @entity309 guy who might 've been 5 feet tall			0
when we rode on a bench seat in the back of a van , six of us on one side with our backs to six others , the @entity309 's little feet dangled over the floor			1
in court , we were represented by father / son attorneys hired by @entity228			1
here 's what i remember : there were three judges and a prosecutor , all wearing powdered wigs and black robes			1
the prosecutor shouted at us in a loud theatrical voice			0
our attorneys answered the charges , and the three judges spoke to each other in hushed tones			0
it was over in 10 minutes			0
i was acquitted ; there was no evidence against me			0
as i recall , @entity19 was found guilty and fined 20,000 @entity338 , about $ 34			0
we found out later that @entity19 ' attorney and one of the judges were friends , and a deal had been made			0
we were released , but it was n't over			0
guilty or not , we were given 48 hours to leave the country			0
which coincided with the end of the school year and our flight back to @entity350			0
@entity19 and i were in the airport , drinking beer with our friends , when two @entity68 in @entity355 fatigues called our names and escorted @entity357 and @entity358 out of the airport terminal , through a gate to the tarmac and up the stairway that led to our plane			0
we were officially kicked out of @entity95 , persona non grata			0
we arrived in @entity350 the next morning , and i took a connecting flight a few hours later			0
my father , @entity366 , was waiting at the gate when i got off the plane in @entity244			1
@entity166 looked at me and said , " hard time makes the boy the man			1

@entity167 's experiences studying in @entity80 *inspired* his book " @entity375 was the girl "
@entity167 's father , @entity366 , is a well - known crime novelist
@entity167 spent time in a notorious prison after getting caught up in an auto theft
