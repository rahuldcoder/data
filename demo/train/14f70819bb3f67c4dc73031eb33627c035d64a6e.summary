-- @entity1 are not who you think they are			1
with effects - laden production , @entity6 - illustrated concept albums and expansive live shows , the band is famously associated with rock ' n ' roll excess			1
it was n't for nothing that the @entity14 ' @entity13 scrawled " i hate " on a @entity1 t - shirt ( though he later admitted he loved the band )			1
but , almost 45 years on , a closer look at the band 's catalog reveals as much hardcore pile - driving ( " @entity23 " ) and wistful melodies ( " @entity25 " ) as the long - form " @entity22 " space rock with which it 's frequently classified			1
still , drummer @entity26 says , it 's hard to escape the pigeonholing			1
" i think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes have n't listened to the music , " he said in a phone interview			1
longtime fans and new listeners will have another chance to size up @entity26 's words			1
the band 's entire studio catalog , including the @entity41 - led 1967 debut " @entity42 , " the @entity44 - dominated " @entity43 " ( 1979 ) and the career - concluding " the @entity45 " ( 1994 ) , has been remastered and is scheduled for release on tuesday			1
" @entity55 , " the band 's 1973 classic , which still holds the record for longest run on the @entity52 album charts , will be issued in three versions : a single cd , a two - disc " @entity57 " that includes a live album , and a six - disc " @entity59 " boxed set			1
@entity26 talked to @entity0 about the band 's evolution , the pitfalls of playing live and fantasies about being the @entity64			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			2
@entity0 : how often do you go back and listen to the old material ? @entity26 : the answer is , i would never willingly put on one of our old records at home for entertainment			1
but with this project , that all changed -- and i was forced at gunpoint to listen to everything , again and again			0
( laughs ) actually , it 's really interesting			1
it 's a bit like a diary -- looking at old photographs			1
what you get is not only the music but the memories that come with it of what you were doing , and how it was in the studio , and all the rest of it			1
@entity0 : there 's been the label placed on @entity1 as " space rock			1
" how did you guys take that label ? @entity26 : one tends to try and reject any labeling anyway , as a matter of principle			1
and i think the labels tend to reflect whatever you were doing before			0
so we were labeled psychedelic -- well , " @entity55 " was the least psychedelic album you could hope to listen to			0
it 's terribly specific and measured and not floaty - off anywhere			1
i think these labels are generally delivered by people who sometimes have n't listened to the music -- sometimes by just looking at the photographs			2
if the band have got curly hair and flared trousers , then they 're prog - rock or space rock , and if they 're very , very grubby , with waistcoats and jeans , then they 're an @entity121 band			1
@entity0 : also , it probably has something to do with what you were smoking or doing when you were listening to the album			0
always be very careful if you 're listening to country and western and doing drugs			0
@entity0 : let 's talk about " @entity130			2
" were you aware that you were creating something different ? @entity26 : i do n't think so			1
my opinion was that we knew we 'd done the best thing so far			0
but as i 've told people , even if you think you 've done the world 's greatest record , that does not guarantee that the public will feel the same way			2
what happened with " @entity130 " was we were out touring with it and it began to come up the @entity147 charts , but we were actually on tour , so there was n't that time to reflect and bask in the glory of being no. 1			2
it was much more , " where are we tomorrow ? @entity154			0
" we were slightly disjointed from its success			0
what the success really bought for us was the thing of moving up a notch			0
you suddenly go from playing theaters to playing arenas			0
and in some cases , arenas into stadiums			0
so that 's the way things catch up with you			2
sometimes they catch you out			0
if you 're used to playing smaller venues , and you suddenly find yourself in a stadium , it 's not necessarily the best place to be working			2
@entity0 : after that , you guys did play a lot of stadiums			0
that led to a lot of discord			0
was there a time when you thought , i wish i could go back to the clubs ? @entity26 : no. i do n't think there was a wish to go back			1
but i think stadiums make quite a lot of bands feel a little uneasy			0
there is that sense that you 're not really connecting with the audience as well as you would			0
i think arenas are fine -- i think arenas are really suited for rock concerts			1
but stadiums , it gets away from you a bit			0
there 's too many people at the back not listening			2
@entity0 : how did the band change for you over the years as leadership went from @entity41 to @entity44 to @entity207 ? @entity26 : i 've always been happy with the way it operates			1
i have no wish to be the fearless leader			0
and interestingly , i think even @entity207 found it pretty wearing when he was sort of in command on the last couple of tours			0
it 's not always easy being the chief			2
i 've always felt that i have my say and i am a partner in it , rather than an employee			0
@entity0 : what do you think are some of the underrated aspects of the band ? @entity26 : to be honest , after this long and this many releases , there 's not much that 's been overlooked			1
i was telling someone yesterday , i feel like a stately home with people taking tours around me			0
@entity0 : how are you guys getting along nowadays ? @entity26 : fine , i think			1
we have n't had any fights recently			2
@entity207 and i pitched up for @entity44 's show in @entity237			2
and it was really nice -- we had dinner together			0
there 's a lot of shared stuff as well as plenty of aggro			2
the fact of the matter is you grow up together			0
the problem is when you start in a band you think it 's all going to be like the @entity64 -- four lovable moptops running around at double speed			1
but then you get married and have children , and being rock and roll often the marriages break up			2
people change as they grow			0
@entity0 : and here you are still with people you knew at 18			0
@entity26 : yes , it 's very unsatisfactory			1
( chuckles ) @entity0 : do you feel like sitting in with an @entity121 band some night ? @entity26 : yeah			1
i still really like playing music , and playing with other people is terrific			0
i was talking with someone about a charity record we did a year or so ago , and the rhythm track was @entity267 playing bass and me playing drums			0
i 've known @entity270 for 35 years or something , and it was great to finally end up playing together			0
it 's always a little bit nerve - wracking -- you 're always alarmed at the prospect of f * * * ing up -- and if you get through it , and someone says , " it 's good , " it 's a very warming feeling .			2
