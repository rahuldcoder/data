-- the @entity1 , which kicked off wednesday on the @entity2 , is an @entity3 of cinema , where endurance matters as much as victory to the 30,000 industry insiders who attend each year			1
the festival was conceived in the late 1930s as a reaction against @entity11 dictator @entity10 promoting fascist - @entity11 and national - socialist @entity13 films at the @entity15			1
its first edition , planned in september 1939 , was delayed by war till 1946 but its ideals remained the same : to show films from all over the world without prejudice of any sort			2
but today @entity1 jostles in the crowded film industry schedules with other a-list events : @entity26 ( and @entity27 ) act as fall launchpads for the following year 's awards season , while @entity30 is at the vanguard of independent cinema and new talent			1
meanwhile the @entity34 are considered by many as the supreme accolade of the movie business			0
@entity38 still regards itself as the grande dame of film events the world over -- but does it still matter ? the festival , which this year celebrates its 67th edition , stands firmly apart -- and , some would argue , above -- the rest of the crowd			0
this comes in part from its original ambition , as put by the festival 's first president , poet @entity52 : " the @entity1 is an apolitical @entity54 , a microcosm of what the world would be like if people could make direct contact with one another and speak the same language			1
" for @entity1 is to cinema what the motto " liberte , egalite , fraternite " ( " liberty , egality , fraternity " ) is to @entity63 : an aspiration , an ideal , an inclusive forum for all talents , old and new , coming from all over the world , and motivated by one common love : films			1
in its early years @entity1 was nothing more than a social event where stars mingled on the red carpet			1
everyone smiled for the camera and everyone went home happy as almost every film received some kind of an award			0
then , @entity1 raised its game			2
first came the @entity86 , its top award , given in 1955 and rivaling the @entity34 as the most prestigious prize in the film industry			0
in 1972 , the festival declared its independence by setting up its own selection committee : until then , each country had chosen the films which would represent them at @entity1 , as still happens with the @entity34 ' best foreign film category			1
the selection of features became more discerning , the awards became fewer in number -- and success at the festival became ever more elusive			0
but if the @entity1 glamor of the 1950s and 1960s lingers still , the festival 's reputation for passion and controversy has only increased			2
the entertainment industry is notorious for controlling its sometimes unruly talents , with @entity111 agencies operating like war machines and publicity a matter of life and death at the box office			0
in contrast @entity1 is a unique place for unleashing imagination and wildness			2
the mix of glamor and high art , frivolity and seriousness combine to make @entity1 a temple to cinema like no other			1
for @entity1 is where directors will throw tantrums and tell critics to go to hell in no uncertain terms ; where the winner of the @entity86 can be booed , as happened to film - maker @entity137 in 1987 when he collected the coveted prize for " @entity142 ; " and where a talent like @entity145 maverick @entity144 can express sympathy at a press conference for @entity148 , then apologize , then be kicked out of the festival by the organizers ( he later withdrew his apology )			1
it is also an event which has always embraced the times			0
in 1968 , while students in @entity157 were rioting and building barricades , the enfants terribles of the @entity153 -- including @entity154 and @entity155 -- canceled the awards ceremony and turned the festival into a giant marketplace			0
in 2004 , @entity166 's " @entity165 " -- which criticized @entity168 foreign policy -- became the first documentary to win the @entity86 from a festival jury which numbered more americans than @entity2			0
for directors and actors , success at @entity1 is the @entity172 that they secretly covet			1
and for the 2,500 or so film critics -- who for 12 days start watching their first film at 8am and their last one just after midnight -- it is the most frantic and rewarding time , when masterpieces are seen for the first time and talents speak freely			2
q. can art really get any more expensive ? @entity182 ' we will see a billion dollar work ' can any train ride match the @entity185 for glamor and sheer romance ? scrap metal find turns out to be $ 33 million @entity190 golden egg			0

film critic @entity192 : the @entity1 is the @entity3 of cinema
it was created as a reaction against @entity11 dictator @entity10 promoting fascist - @entity11 films
@entity200 : at @entity1 directors are free to throw tantrums and tell critics what they really think
today success at @entity1 is the @entity172 directors and actors secretly covet , says @entity192
