-- here 's an uncomfortable truth confronting @entity3 president @entity2 : it 's 2014 , but the pro-democracy , pro-rights sentiments that manifested across @entity3 as demonstrations in 1989 are still alive and well			1
for 25 years , the @entity3 government has tried to expunge the june 4 , 1989 , @entity10 massacre from history to deny people inside the country any knowledge of the event			1
and as the second largest economy in the world , @entity20 host , and @entity22 member , @entity16 has also maintained to the outside world that june 4 is " much ado about nothing " and a " strictly internal affair			1
" @entity16 's strategy of suppression has proved successful in some quarters			1
many in @entity3 have generally focused on getting ahead economically while staying away from politics			1
but in other quarters , the strategy has produced the opposite outcome , fueling domestic demands for accountability and ongoing attention to @entity3 's abysmal human rights record			1
" harmonious society , " " social stability , " " stability maintenance " -- these are the watchwords of the current @entity3 government			2
but imposed stability is oxymoronic			0
not a week goes by without hundreds of protests over land or housing issues in rural areas , and environmental or infrastructure projects in major urban areas			0
@entity3 's security forces and judiciary systems are using increasingly heavy - handed tactics to track and suppress all manners of peaceful expressions in ethnic minority regions			1
@entity57 are prohibited from wearing beards			0
prosecutions are set up against those who know @entity60 who self - immolated			0
despite a proliferation of laws , there are few avenues for public feedback , let alone redress or debate without fear of reprisal for ordinary citizens			0
the combination of repression and denial of justice are clearly breeding more , not less , discontent in @entity3			1
every year in the weeks leading up to june 4 , critics of the @entity3 government anticipate higher - than - usual scrutiny , ranging from arbitrary impositions of house arrest to people being taken to police stations to " have tea			1
" this year 's crackdown started early and ferociously			2
in early may , roughly a dozen people gathered in a @entity16 apartment to discuss @entity10			2
they sent a photograph of the group and a brief summary of the discussion to friends and contacts			0
within a few days , five of them , well - known human rights lawyer @entity98 , academics @entity93 and @entity95 , blogger @entity96 , and dissident @entity97 had all been criminally detained on charges of causing a disturbance			1
previous gatherings like this had merited the attention of the police , but had not resulted in actual charges			0
so spooked are @entity3 authorities that @entity109 , the founder of the @entity110 , a group formed to press for accountability for family members ' deaths in 1989 , has been told she may not return to @entity16 in early june			1
this will be the first year she must observe the anniversary of her son 's death from afar			2
@entity3 's central and local governments occasionally make concessions , seemingly designed to placate popular frustrations			1
the widely loathed arbitrary detention system known as " re-education through labor , " in which people could be incarcerated by police for up to three years with no trial , was abolished in late 2013			0
some of the most controversial chemical and industrial facilities have been shut down or construction put on hold			0
but many of these are half measures , or only temporary fixes			0
in response to the political status quo , a law - based , rights - oriented consciousness has emerged in @entity3 , and advocates known as the weiquan have started a " rights defense " movement			1
these activists , who endure police monitoring , detention , arrest , enforced disappearance and torture , monitor and document human rights cases across the country			1
some of their most prominent members were involved in the 1989 protests , and they say that @entity10 and its legacy informs their current efforts			0
four of these lawyers were detained and tortured in @entity160 in march 2014 , yet have continued to try to represent politically unpopular cases			0
similarly , the @entity162 is an informal group that has advocated the promotion of civic rights and participation , including the public disclosure of officials ' assets to curb corruption , or protecting the rights of children of migrant workers			2
at least five of its members , including prominent lawyer @entity176 , have been sentenced this year on charges of " gathering crowds to disturb public order			0
" these activists , too , know the price they are likely to pay for their efforts , yet they carry on , believing that transforming society into a democracy that respects the rule of law requires citizen participation			2
the @entity187 and social media have replaced the hand - lettered placards at @entity10 , but the messages are similar : accountability for abusive officials , transparency from the state , justice for all			0
independent @entity3 organizations try to engage directly with @entity199 organizations			2
but these kinds of actions often provoke extraordinary wrath of the government			0
one activist , @entity204 , was imprisoned in 2013 for her efforts to participate in a review of @entity3 's record at the @entity199 @entity208			1
she died in detention in february 2014 after being denied adequate medical treatment			0
a truly confident leadership in @entity16 would recognize these demands for what they are : efforts to improve life for ordinary people across the country			2
and while such groups are prevented from gathering at @entity10 , they increasingly find one another and try to push for change via social media and legal channels			0
they show no sign of scaling back their demands for human rights			1
so , will the @entity3 government meet them halfway at least ?			2

june 4 marks the 25th anniversary of the @entity233 massacre
@entity235 : when will @entity3 's leaders stop *whitewashing* the event ?
she says @entity16 's tactics of suppression and crackdown breed discontent
@entity235 : brave @entity3 activists are still trying to defend human rights
