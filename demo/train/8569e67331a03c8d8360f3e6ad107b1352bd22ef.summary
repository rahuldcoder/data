@entity0 grew up in the 1960s and says a " restlessness " drew him to reading about @entity2 , practicing yoga and eating a vegetarian diet			1
but , while in high school , he also found drugs			1
after dropping out of college , he moved to @entity9 , where , he says , " my first week there i was introduced to shooting cocaine			1
" eventually , heroin helped calm his " crazy cocaine brain			2
" he stayed in the downward spiral for years before fighting to get clean			1
here are five questions for @entity0 : @entity16 : you started doing yoga as a teenager when you were living in @entity20 , but you did n't really get serious about it until you moved to @entity22			1
what happened ? @entity0 : when i lived in @entity25 , i would jog around @entity26 , dreading each lap. i was never a good jock , but yoga just felt so intense			1
there was a soft side and a strong side to it and a spiritual feeling around it			2
it really felt like it embodied my whole thing			2
so i started going to a few vinyasa flow and power flow classes in @entity22			1
there was music at some of them , and it was really physically challenging			2
it just kept calling me back			2
i did n't dread it like , " oh , no , i 've got to go the gym tomorrow			2
" i know people who love the gym , and they go , and it 's a great thing for them			1
that was just never my experience , but with yoga , i was excited about it , and i just kept on doing it			1
@entity16 : you were n't sure if you could make a career out of it , though			2
then came a pivotal moment			2
what was it like teaching your first class ? @entity0 : i did a lot of teacher trainings			1
i was studying @entity62 , and i just resisted teaching as much as i loved it			2
a friend of mine was teaching at a gym in @entity67 , and he said there were like three students that came			2
it was in an air - conditioned room at seven in the morning			0
he said , " i 'm going away			0
will you please teach for me ? " i said , " absolutely not			0
" he said , " i 'm going away			0
you have to teach for me			0
" so i went and did it			0
then , i was at another class at the gym i belonged to , and the teacher did n't show up			0
there were a whole bunch of students in the room , and they said , " you should teach ! you 're good at it , and you 're always here			0
" so i it did it again , and it was fun			0
then it just started unfolding for me			0
i started substitute teaching at yoga works for @entity92 and @entity93 and @entity94 , which is really funny			1
these are big names in yoga			1
it was really funny at the time			0
@entity16 : i 've heard you ask in class , " who knows about the past or the future ? @entity103 said it all with ' be here now			0
' " how did this become your philosophy ? @entity0 : the older i get , the more i become aware of the fact that life does n't stop when bad things happen			1
you still go to work			0
you still function , for the most part			0
i 'm around a lot of people every day -- and i 'm aware , from knowing these people year after year , that when some people disappear , i 'm like , " wow , i wonder where they went			0
" then they come back and tell me their husband died , they 're living with their family -- or " i got a divorce , " " i 've been on cancer treatment			0
" there are just so many things you do n't actually see when you see a person , even if they appear healthy and strong and beautiful , which there 's a lot of in @entity22 @entity16 : in fact , you say you 've been drawn to @entity2 because they do n't " rainbow - color " everything and simply encourage people to think good thoughts			1
why do you so strongly believe in this mentality ? @entity0 : underneath everything , we 're all in this human predicament			1
in @entity2 , they talk about , inherently in life , there 's suffering			1
there are a lot of people here in @entity22 who have it all right now			1
so if you see someone and say , " wow , they have a great career , tons of money ; they 're beautiful , " there 's almost a sadness in knowing that 's not going to last forever			1
even if by some stroke of luck , whatever it is , you have an amazing life and nothing bad ever happens to you , you know that sooner or later , you 're going to pass away , and everyone you love is , too			0
there 's suffering in that			1
@entity16 : from everything you 've gone through , what 's your message to anyone who 's trying to live well ? @entity0 : enjoy right now and be as kind to others as you can			1
a message that transcends every religion and spirituality is to be of service			0
whatever it looks like in your life , as minimal or as big as it could be , people of service are usually happier because when you 're of service , you realize you 're a part of a whole			0
they talk about this because people that live the longest feel like they 're connected to a community			0
whatever community that is , there 's some connection that someone cares about			1
you care about them , and that makes our hearts beat			0
that makes us desire to get up and keep going .			0

today , he 's one of the hottest yoga teachers in @entity22
