-- @entity1 said he had fish practically leaping onto the @entity3 during his cross-pacific voyage in 1947 , but the bounty from the sea has n't been so rich for the crew of the @entity8			1
with only three fish caught to date , they 've been relying on their larder for provisions			2
but it 's not a diet of ship 's biscuits , limes and rum rations for @entity19 and the crew ; their galley is complete with meals that would not look out of place at a chic @entity26 restaurant			1
in keeping with the ethos of the expedition , all the @entity8 's food is sustainably sourced and where possible , organic			1
from beef bourguignon to lamb ragout and @entity34 chicken curry , the meals were devised by @entity26 - based foodies @entity36 and @entity37			1
@entity38 and @entity39 are the gourmands behind @entity41 ! , a home - delivery sustainable food company			1
" our mission is to bring joy and fun back to your kitchen , or in your case , the galley , " said @entity39 and @entity38 in their specially devised food guide for the @entity8			2
" in sum , these ingredients and meals hold lots of care and intention for the crew			2
" keeping the crew buoyant and healthy are hundreds of pounds of fresh kale , cabbage , leeks , beets , chilies and other greens and many fruits			0
all were dried and packed before setting off			0
all the meats and meat dishes aboard come from grass - fed , sustainable livestock raised close to @entity26			2
the meat was cooked alone or as a stew with very rich stock then placed in hot sterile jars and pressure - cooked to ensure freshness and preservation			0
the crew have more than 110 of these ready - meals to keep them going through the long journey			1
the crew might be more familiar with riggings than roulades but @entity39 and @entity38 have a simple message for them when it comes to cooking : " we encourage you to follow this bit of sage advice from @entity92 : ' learn how to cook -- try new recipes , learn from your mistakes , be fearless , and above all have fun ! ' " @entity8 also is supplied with a nutritional guide for the crew advising them on what to eat and how to build meals that support the periods of high - level activity during the voyage			1
" incorporate protein steadily into all your meals , especially with breakfast			0
this will help keep your energy stronger and steadier , and help control your blood sugar levels throughout the day as well , " is a central piece of advice from the guide			0
of course the all important rule is all on board is to hydrate well , something the crew discovered toward the end of the first leg of the journey , when water levels on board were so low not enough could be spared to keep the on - board hydroponic garden alive			1
" after 20 days at sea we realized we were using more water for the plants than we anticipated and we were slightly concerned about our own water intake , " @entity19 told @entity0			0
" we took the decision to drink the water ourselves [ instead of water the garden ]			0
it was a sad day when the last of our kale wilted but we had a very good spinach omelette and said a fond farewell to it			0
