-- a wind of change blew through @entity2 monday and thankfully it was gentle enough to allow the @entity5 's @entity4 to finally get under way			1
for three days in a row the 30 - strong field , all of whom won a @entity12 event in 2012 , had to sit idly by as play was canceled due to strong winds and driving rain			0
it led to the bizarre sight of @entity18 officially starting the new campaign three times , after his first two attempts were derailed by the weather			0
but once the action began @entity25 's detailed preparation for the competition showed , as his six practice rounds prior to teeing off in @entity28 helped him shoot rounds of 69 and 66 to lead on 11 - under - par. the @entity32 @entity31 star leads by three shots from fellow countryman @entity34 , with 2012 @entity35 champion @entity35 a further shot back .			2

@entity25 leads the @entity12 's @entity4 in @entity2
play was *abandoned* on *friday* , *saturday* and *sunday* due to strong winds
@entity25 leads on 11 - under after the field played *36* holes on monday
