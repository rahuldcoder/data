@entity0 -- when president @entity3 took the podium on tuesday night , he followed in the footsteps of generations of presidents before him : speaking to the @entity9 people about a critical issue facing the @entity9			1
but he did n't follow literally in those footsteps : unlike many presidents before him , he spoke from the @entity13 -- not the traditional setting of the @entity15			1
from president @entity17 announcing the invasion of @entity19 to president @entity20 announcing the beginning of the @entity22 to president @entity23 announcing the invasion of @entity25 , presidents have chosen to use the visual power of the " @entity15			1
" @entity3 , though , has used that iconic setting for prime - time speeches only twice during his presidency , both within months of each other			0
in june 2010 , the president sat behind the @entity33 desk and updated the nation on " the battle we 're waging against an oil spill that is assaulting our shores and our citizens , " after the @entity40 exploded off the coast of @entity42			0
in august of that year , @entity3 made a point to reference the setting of his speech announcing the end of the combat mission in @entity25			1
" from this desk , seven - and - a - half years ago , president @entity23 announced the beginning of military operations in @entity25			0
much has changed since that night , " @entity3 said			2
when it was time for @entity3 to make his major military announcement -- the may 2011 death of @entity54 -- he chose to walk down the long @entity56 hallway to his @entity13 podium , the same setting he used for his @entity59 speech			1
@entity3 is not the first president , though , to break with tradition of either the location or timing in making major pronouncements			2
president @entity66 's first comments on his missile strikes in @entity68 and @entity69 in 1998 came from an ad - hoc press room set up in a @entity72 school where he was on vacation			0
he would make a second , more formal announcement later that day from the @entity15			0
president @entity20 regularly used the @entity15 , and he made perhaps the earliest - ever speech in december 1989 : a 7:20 a.m. nationwide address to announce military action in @entity78 .			0

@entity3 's speech tuesday night was in the tradition of other @entity9 presidents
however , unlike most presidents , @entity3 again chose the @entity13 instead of the @entity15
he also told the nation about the death of @entity54 from the @entity13
