when " @entity5 " aired last week on @entity4 's state - run tv channel , its viewers who number in the millions noticed something odd : the chair where star journalist @entity8 sits was empty			1
the 37 - year - old @entity10 was taken away shortly before airtime friday by prosecutors as part of a widening anti-corruption investigation			1

@entity10 shot to fame in 2007 when he led a successful campaign to kick @entity18 out of the @entity19 in @entity54			1

the campaign won him both ardent fans and critics			2
unabashedly nationalistic , he often defends government policies on the world stage and is known for baiting @entity57 officials			1
in 2010 , when @entity57 president @entity67 said he would give the final question at a press conference in @entity70 to @entity72 media , @entity10 declared : " i 'm actually @entity4 , but i think i get to represent the entire @entity73			1
" at an economic forum the following year , @entity10 asked @entity75 , then the @entity57 ambassador to @entity4 : " my colleagues told me you flew economy class here -- was that a reminder that the @entity57 still owes @entity4 money ? " what got him in trouble ? keyword : corruption			1
speculation about @entity10 's troubles began last month when his longtime patron @entity87 , the head of state - run @entity29 's financial news channel , was detained for allegedly accepting bribes			0
state media have said his detention is closely linked to @entity87 's case , as well as an investigation into his own possible profiting from using cctv resources			2
reports have since surfaced that @entity10 -- already a @entity29 journalist -- co-founded a public relations company called @entity100 in 2002 and remained an important -- though minority -- shareholder for more than eight years			0

@entity26 's reported detention is but the latest twist in an intensifying campaign launched by @entity4 president @entity112 against official corruption , a lightning rod for mass discontent			1
when describing his resolve to spare no one -- regardless of position -- in his anti-corruption drive , @entity112 has said he would strike " tigers and flies " alike			2
@entity29 recently counted the capture of 35 " tigers " -- including a retired top general and a former national leader -- since @entity112 took power less than two years ago			0
in the grand scheme of things , @entity10 appears to be a " fly " caught in @entity112 's widening net			0
many observers , however , have noted his ties -- albeit indirect -- to @entity133 , the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be the biggest " tiger " under investigation			0
@entity87 , @entity26 's patron at @entity29 , has long been considered belonging to the @entity133 faction			0
what is the public reaction ? keyword : divided			0
after the initial shock , thousands of @entity26 's loyal fans have left messages on his @entity44 page to express continued support for their role model			0
the more prevailing sentiment in @entity4 cyberspace , however , appears to be one of schadenfreude with many " netizens " cheering @entity10 's downfall			0
" considering @entity10 has n't really hurt anyone , it 's impressive to see how many people he has disgusted or offended , " tweeted @entity157 , a leading @entity4 commentator			0
" it 's just telling how stinky the reputation is for the @entity164 's human mouthpieces , whether @entity4 or @entity33 speakers			0
" @entity166 , the party 's official newspaper , seems to feel obliged to respond , reminding readers in a commentary published online : " @entity26 is not a spokesman for patriotism			0
the only bases for his crime and punishment should be evidence and laws -- it has absolutely nothing to do with patriotism			0
