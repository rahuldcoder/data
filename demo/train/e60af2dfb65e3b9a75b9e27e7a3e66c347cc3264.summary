-- " making @entity7 is the reason we 're here now , " @entity0 says early on in @entity4 's new @entity3 documentary , " @entity6 , " which premiered at the @entity5 on thursday night			1
the film -- which focuses on the tumultuous time in the band 's career 20 years ago -- shows how @entity0 , guitarist the edge , drummer @entity14 and bassist @entity15 got back on track : after considerable infighting and " creative differences " while the four hunkered down at @entity20 in @entity21 in 1990 to try to make an album , the song " one " finally and miraculously sprouted from the unfinished " mysterious ways			1
" " the movie has this pretty long [ section ] where you hear them write that song -- and it 's goose bumps , " @entity4 told @entity1 in @entity5			1
" the writing of that song really saved the band			2
they had come out of the height of @entity38 as the biggest band in the world			2
' @entity46 ' was a disaster from their point of view , a lot of bad reviews -- they were n't happy with what they had become			2
they take that bridge section out of ' @entity24 ' and they go back into the room at @entity20			0
they write a song on the fly in a matter of minutes			0
' one ' is written and the band is saved and we have all that on tape			2
" there are other telling inclusions in the film , from footage of @entity0 getting angry in a dressing room after a @entity38 concert in 1987 ( culled from @entity46 and @entity68 director @entity67 's amazing leftovers ) to candid , present - day sound - only interviews that @entity4 was able to draw from each band member			1
" the soul of the movie is these interviews i do with them , " he said			2
" i did n't know how they 'd react to the things that i put in the movie , " said @entity4			1
" there are some very sensitive things			0
and to their credit , they said , ' this is truthful ; this is real ; it 's not sensational			2
' " @entity1 : the @entity85 the day after the @entity5 gala screening , @entity0 , the edge and @entity4 spoke at a press conference about the film			1
" i found it a little humiliating to realize that we were so inept and these days we 're a better band , " @entity0 said			0
" we 've learned our craft -- and therein lies the huge danger , which is there 's a giant chasm between the very good and the great , and @entity3 right now has a danger of surrendering to the very good			0
" @entity4 had earned the @entity87 's trust from the documentary they did together in 2008 , " it might get loud , " alongside two other guitar greats , @entity102 and @entity103			1
still , it 's a relationship in progress , @entity4 noted : " there 's a something adversarial about making a movie about something that neither side wants , but it 's naturally there			1
" " for me , when @entity4 agreed to do this , i felt like i could relax because i knew the thing that he was most interested in was actually the truth as opposed to what was a great shot or what might be sensational , " said @entity87			1
" the stuff that 's in the film are those moments where we 're really being honest			1
" " a little bit of sensationalism would have been good , a few great shots , " joked @entity0			0
" i felt like i was mugged			0
" in addition to the tension , intensity and struggle that plays out in the film , there is a lot of levity too , including a satirical montage of bands that have imploded or lost members , references and demonstrations of @entity0 's unique gibberish singing , dubbed " @entity137 " and yes , the band in drag			1
" what 's interesting is @entity14 really did n't like the idea and thought he looked like he was in some skin flick , " said @entity0			0
" edge took to it with a perfectionist 's eye			0
" " i just freaked myself out because i looked so much like my sister , i was shocked , " the @entity87 said			0
added @entity0 : " @entity15 looked like the @entity148 and i looked like @entity149			0
