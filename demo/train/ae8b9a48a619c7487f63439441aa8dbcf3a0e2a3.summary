@entity0 -- describing the billions of dollars in contracts and services handled by the @entity6 as a den of temptation , senators from both parties on wednesday called for the agency at the center of a spending scandal to clean house as it roots out corruption			1
" the party 's over , " declared @entity16 sen. @entity15 of @entity17 , chairwoman of the @entity18 , at one of four congressional hearing so far this week on the controversy that has embarrassed the @entity23 administration in an election year			1
speaking to @entity6 inspector general @entity27 and acting administrator @entity28 , @entity15 said the panel " will support you and encourage you to clean house " at the vast federal procurement agency			1
at the same time , @entity15 emphasized that the @entity6 has a history of misconduct dating back decades under @entity37 and @entity16 administrations , and that it was a person appointed by president @entity23 who uncovered the latest wrongdoing involving an $ 800,000 work conference and other abuses			1
@entity42 on @entity6 and @entity43 controversies @entity28 and @entity27 also testified later wednesday at a @entity18 appropriations subcommittee hearing where chairman @entity46 , @entity47 , wondered how the hundreds of @entity6 employees exposed to the excesses failed to question the obvious misconduct taking place			1
" it 's appalling that someone did n't say , ' wait a minute			0
is n't this going overboard ? ' " @entity46 said			0
democrats sought to frame the controversy as an ongoing problem at @entity6 rather than anything unique to the @entity23 administration , and @entity37 on the panel cited what they called a systematic failure resulting from a culture of misconduct at the agency			1
ranking @entity37 sen. @entity65 of @entity66 said of the @entity6 that " if there 's anyone who has a propensity to do something dishonest , that 's where they ought to be " because " they deal with huge numbers			1
" " i am concerned that this type of waste has become an embedded part of the culture at the @entity6 , " @entity65 said , noting the wrongdoing occurred at a time of fiscal austerity , including calls by @entity23 to cut government waste			1
" one can only wonder what kind of waste would have occurred in a better economy			0
" @entity15 later used an extended closing statement to encourage @entity28 to take substantive steps to solve the problems at @entity6 once and for all , no matter what it takes			1
" there still are ugly things that are going to come out			0
let 's face it , " @entity15 said of continuing investigations by @entity27			1
" what is so outrageous about this is how these bad apples , very bad apples , perhaps criminal apples , have sullied the reputation of very good people , " @entity15 said , adding , " do n't underestimate this job you have in terms of shaking this tree and letting these bad apples fall			0
" earlier this week , two @entity37 - led @entity109 committees held hearings examining the scandal , which became public last month with @entity27 's final report detailing a @entity6 conference in @entity114 that cost more than $ 800,000 , as well as violations of travel and spending rules			1
the revelations have prompted taxpayer indignation and put a spotlight on wasteful spending by the @entity6 , which handles government real estate and other nonmilitary procurement			1
asked wednesday about how to fix the problems at @entity6 , @entity27 called for more centralized control of the agency with more oversight to hold regional officials accountable for spending			1
@entity28 said he already has been taking steps to improve central oversight as part of a review of the entire agency			2
that review is expected to take months			0
on tuesday , @entity109 members questioned why @entity137 , the @entity6 staff member who organized the 2010 @entity114 conference , took more trips on the federal dime after @entity27 's preliminary report last year showed spending and travel abuses			1
@entity137 was put on administrative leave in march , a month after @entity27 had submitted his final report			1
@entity137 declined to show up for tuesday 's session of the @entity147 , claiming his fifth amendment right against self - incrimination in the investigation			0
he also declined to testify at the @entity152 's hearing monday			0
on wednesday , @entity15 took a shot at the monday hearing where @entity137 repeatedly claimed his fifth amendment rights			0
" we 're not looking for photo ops of people taking the @entity159 , " @entity15 said			0
" we 're trying to move forward and make sure this does n't happen again			0
" the controversy , which includes allegations of personal travel under the thin guise of government business and an employee award program that exceeded spending limits , so far has focused on one of 10 regions of the @entity6 -- an agency with a multibillion - dollar budget and more than 12,000 employees			1
coming in an election year , the scandal has become a political focal point , with republicans seeking to frame it as a reflection of big government abuse while @entity16 say the problem involved a few bad players rather than a rotten system			2
during this week 's hearings , past and present @entity6 officials have described the agency 's complex management structure that proved unable to respond quickly to misconduct cited by the inspector general 's report			1
for example , the chief financial officer lacked direct oversight of regional budgets			0
one exchange tuesday between rep. @entity193 , a freshman @entity37 from @entity17 , and @entity27 highlighted the ways that @entity137 , and presumably others , avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the @entity114 event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed			1
" to get around the administration 's rule of not having food , they got around it by having an awards ceremony at every conference or every day of a conference ? " @entity193 asked			0
@entity27 responded : " according to witnesses that we 've interviewed , it was a running joke in region 9 that in order to get food , you had to give out awards -- and many of these awards were silly awards			2
" " one of our witnesses characterized them , i guess , as fake awards , jackass awards and things of that nature , " @entity27 said			2
" now , getting back to the @entity232 's conference -- they gave out awards for theatrical performances			0
we do not consider that a proper award			0
the award has to be for contributions to the work of the agency			0
" @entity241 , the @entity6 administrator who resigned april 2 because of the scandal , said tuesday that the @entity232 conference at the heart of the problem had become a " raucous , extravagant , arrogant , self - congratulatory event that ultimately belittled federal workers			2
" among videos of the conference that have surfaced is one of @entity251 , a deputy commissioner of the @entity6 , an arm of the @entity6 , appearing to mock congressional oversight			2
in it , he gave a talent show award to an employee whose video featured a rap about spending too much and joking about avoiding investigation			2
additional videos included one that seemed to make fun of @entity23 , as well as a fake red carpet ceremony with @entity137 boasting that his goal was to make the conference " over the top			2
" details also emerged of the employee incentive program , which violated limits on awards or gifts			0
@entity27 said wednesday that ongoing investigations are looking at several regions of the @entity6 , and that his experience so far has found that each stone uncovered brought further revelations			1
he said that in the wake of the scandal , employees were coming forward to report other possible wrongdoing			0
" even today , we found out that the wife of the regional commissioner had a parking space throughout the entire year of 2012 at the federal building , " @entity27 said			2
" and we just find one thing after another			0
" @entity28 , however , said there was no evidence so far of endemic misconduct throughout the @entity6 , noting he has encouraged agency workers to reach out to him with concerns			2
" they have not been shy , " @entity28 said .			0
