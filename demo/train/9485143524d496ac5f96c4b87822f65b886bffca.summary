several hundred bloggers and other guests -- including musician @entity13 , who had been invited by @entity4 to play a few songs -- were ushered to a nearby room to handle the phones			1
i got to spend some time playing with both devices			1
an in - depth review will have to wait , but here are my first impressions			2
design of the @entity21 the body of the @entity21 is the same shape andt design at the @entity24 , but the company has rolled out some new color options			1
the rumored golden @entity24 is real , and a very classy champagne shade of fake gold			0
the face of the phone is all glass over the screen and surrounding white frame , while the muted gold is only visible on the sides and back			0
the @entity21 also comes in silver and another new color @entity4 is calling " space gray			1
" the gray @entity24 is the only one in the @entity21 lineup that has a black faceplate instead of white			1
fingerprint sensor the most intriguing new hardware feature on the @entity21 is the fingerprint sensor in its home button			1
it does n't replace the old pass code and can even be turned off			0
the phone can be unlocked by using either a fingerprint or the code , so if you hand a friend your phone while you 're driving , you can just tell them what number to enter			2
each phone can record up to five individual fingerprints -- say one for each member of the family you do n't mind using it ( maybe purposefully leaving out the kids )			0
to add a new print , you first must enter your security code			0
pick a finger , preferably the one you use most to press the home button			0
for most people , this will be their thumb			0
to record a print , you place your finger on the home button until it vibrates and then lift and repeat			0
this goes on for a number of times as it gets a full image of the finger			0
it also grabs a few impressions of the sides of your finger for a complete picture			0
to open the phone with a fingerprint , you press the home button down as usual but then keep the finger on the small circle			2
it will automatically skip the pass code screen and take you to the home screen			0
you also can use a fingerprint to pay for purchases from the @entity89 or @entity90			2
it worked seamlessly when i tested it , though adding new profiles takes a bit of time			1
but it 's a much faster way to open the phone than entering a pass code , and there is no " reading your print now " type of delay on screen			2
camera the new camera on the @entity21 is packed with a number of legitimately cool new features , the result of software and hardware improvements			1
the new burst mode , which takes rapid - fire photos at a rate of 10 per second , is meant for capturing moving subjects such as twitchy children or sprinting athletes			1
i took 40 shots in four seconds -- so many that scrolling through them created a neat time - lapse video effect			1
you can dig through all 40 images yourself to find the winners , but @entity4 has added a feature that identifies what it thinks are the best in the bunch automatically based on things such as exposure , blur and if the subject 's eyes are open			2
out of the 40 images , two were highlighted with a small gray dot			0
in the camera roll , the burst photos were lumped together in one pile so i could easily delete all the extras after i picked my final shots			0
with another new feature , i tried making a slow - motion video			1
the camera can record 120 frames per second , which is helpful for slowing down and stretching out detailed scenes			0
you scroll to the @entity146 before shooting the video			2
after the clip is recorded , you choose what section of it to slow down			2
the final video looked impressively professional , even though it was just of tech bloggers milling about a room			1
the room was a bit too bright to accurately test out the new flash			0
@entity4 claims the flash will automatically adjust color and intensity depending on the subject and lighting situation			0
it has two different colored led lights instead of the usual one			0
a better flash would be a welcome improvement over the traditional led flashes on @entity165 ( and most other smartphones ) that flood scenes with harsh light			0
graphics the faster processor inside the @entity21 means everything is zippier , including the graphics			1
this is the case with every new @entity24 , so it 's hard to tell how much of an upgrade this one is			2
but the high - end game apps did look rich			2
@entity4 is calling the new graphics " console level , " so next time we 'll have to test it head to head with an @entity180			2
@entity182 the lower - priced @entity182 does n't have as many fancy new hardware features			1
instead , its pizazz is mostly on the outside			0
@entity4 rounded the corners down and encased the @entity182 in a smooth hard plastic shell instead of metal			1
plastic has a reputation of being cheap and breakable , but @entity4 is pitching this as high - end plastic			1
@entity4 design head @entity193 even says , " the @entity182 is beautifully , unapologetically plastic			1
" the polycarbonate body does feel sturdier than other plastic phones , and the phone still has bit of weight to it			1
the entire back side of the phone is one seamless piece of plastic and comes in blue , green , pink , yellow and white			0
the colors look subdued in press images , but in person the green and pink are a bit more fluorescent and bright			0
apparently @entity4 did n't think one super bright color was enough , so it also created a line of $ 29 soft silicon shells for the @entity182			1
the blue , green , pink , yellow , black and white cases have a grid of holes in the back so you can see the original shade of the @entity182 through them as lines of dots .			1

@entity2 's @entity228 spent a few minutes with new newly *launched* iphones tuesday
@entity21 fingerprint sensor worked seamlessly , though adding profiles takes some time
a slow - motion video looked impressively professional
the polycarbonate body on the @entity182 feels sturdier than other plastic phones
