@entity1 @entity0 is a @entity3			1
and at times also even a @entity6			0
while the question -- where is @entity0 from ? -- may seem simple , the answer was made harder as @entity10 traveled the country over the last six months stumping for @entity13 candidates during the midterms and peddling her memoir			1
people from at least four states like to lay claim to @entity10 , and the former secretary of state never shied away from those signs of citizenship			1
born in @entity22 , @entity5 in 1947 , @entity10 rose to prominence during her 20 - year stay in @entity4 from 1974 to 1992			1
after living in @entity1 , for eight years as first lady , @entity10 moved to @entity26 , @entity3 and represented the @entity27 for eight years in the @entity28			1
geographical identity politics are a core part of the @entity32 campaign trail from local offices all the way up @entity35 -- just ask @entity36 or @entity37 -- and having home roots that are considered authentic by voters is a key part of messaging for any presidential hopeful , and that includes @entity10			1
at times , she plays up her @entity4 roots and slight southern accent			2
in other forums , she is the former senator from @entity3 and resident of @entity26			0
and when she is anywhere in the @entity51 , @entity10 is the @entity52 - loving child from @entity22 , @entity5			1
the @entity53 currently maintain their primary residence in @entity3 and another home in @entity1 @entity10 's returning to one of these " home " states this weekend -- @entity4 -- for a 10th anniversary celebration of the @entity60 in @entity61			1
here is how @entity10 is linked to four states -- @entity5 , @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity35 -- and why it matters			1
@entity5 : in @entity65 , @entity10 is heralded as a native daughter			1
giving her an introduction at an october event in @entity65 , @entity67 said he was " welcoming her home			0
" mayor @entity72 said in june that @entity10 " still and will forever be a @entity65 at heart			1
" @entity10 spent her first eighteen years of life in @entity22 , @entity5 , a middle class neighborhood a few miles from downtown			1
@entity10 , however , left the state in 1965 to attend @entity79 in @entity80 and since then has not lived in @entity5 for any considerable time			1
@entity10 maintains a small group of @entity22 friends to this day			0
when she visited the city in june , she had a small dinner with many of them and reminisced about their years in at school and in their methodist church group			0
" it is always great to be back in @entity65 , " @entity10 said in october			1
" this is where i was born , where i grew up			0
where i made so many life long friends and it is wonderful to be part of an extended community such as @entity65 represents			0
" @entity4 : more than any other state , the @entity10 family is most closely associated with @entity4			1
@entity0 moved to @entity101 , @entity4 in 1974 to marry @entity10 , a native son of the state and rising political star			1
for the next 18 years , the @entity53 came to dominate the state 's political scene			0
@entity10 served one term as attorney general before serving five terms as governor			2
@entity0 was a high profile first lady in the state , but @entity4 was never really home for her			1
even her closest friends acknowledge that @entity0 was never in love with @entity4 and was at times put off by how women were viewed			2
@entity0 does , however , occasionally returns to the state , as she did when she spoke at two @entity61 events in july			0
and longtime @entity13 in the state still lay claim to the former first lady			0
" @entity0 's roots in @entity4 run deep , and many @entity121 still consider her their hometown girl , " said @entity119 , a former @entity10 aide from @entity4			1
" as a native @entity4 , i could not be more proud to call her one of us			0
" @entity3 : when @entity0 decided to run for @entity28 in 2000 , she had no connection to @entity3			2
and @entity126 knew it was a weakness			0
" name me three things @entity0 has ever done for the people of @entity3 , " @entity128 , then a @entity3 radio host , proclaimed regularly during his show at the time			2
aware of the challenges , @entity10 traveled the state on a " listening tour " and talked with voters in schools , labor halls and community buildings			0
she also established residency in the @entity27 by moving to @entity26 , the small hamlet that the @entity53 still consider home today			0
" i think i have some real work to do , to get out and listen and learn from the people of @entity3 and demonstrate that what i 'm for is maybe as important , if not more important , than where i 'm from , " @entity10 told the @entity143 in 1999			2
@entity10 even played up her sporting allegiances to become closer to @entity3			2
" i am @entity52 fan , " she told an audience in @entity65 before noting that because she " could n't stay hitched with a losing team " she " became a @entity149 fan			0
" @entity10 's supporters argue she was a @entity149 fan as a child and photos from 1992 published in her 2003 memoir " @entity155 " show the first lady in a @entity3 hat			1
" i 'm wearing the hat of my lifelong favorite @entity162 team , " says the description under the photo			0
today , @entity10 identifies most with @entity3			2
she lives there , votes there and her office is in @entity167			0
@entity35 : of the states that have laid claim to @entity10 , @entity35 is the most random			1
@entity10 's father -- @entity171 -- was born in @entity172 , a city in the @entity174 corner of the state			2
the @entity171 family has deep ties to the region and even after moving to @entity65 , @entity0 and her family would spend summers at a rustic cabin on @entity182 on the city 's outskirts			1
( if @entity172 sounds familiar , that 's because it 's also from where another potential 2016 @entity13 hopeful vice president @entity186			0
) " the rustic cabin had no heat except for the cast - iron cook stove in the kitchen , and no indoor bath or shower , " @entity10 wrote in her memoir " @entity155			0
" " to stay clean , we swam in the lake or stood below the back porch while someone poured a tub of water onto our heads			0
" so when @entity10 campaigned for @entity35 @entity13 in 2014 , many used those roots to tie her with the state			2
@entity205 , the governor - elect of the state , said , " coursing through [ @entity0 's ] veins is blood that 's tinged with @entity35 values and @entity35 ideas			1
" at the event , @entity10 also played up those roots and talked about her father 's side of the family , their interest in politics and her time on the lake			2
" i spent every summer of my growing up years traveling on the turnpike going up to @entity172 and often times during @entity220 coming back , " @entity10 said			0
" the state has been very good to my family and to my husband and to me			0
" @entity10 's ties to the state also came in handy when @entity10 ran for president in 2008			2
because @entity10 was able to better identify with the hard scrabble , predominately white @entity13 of central and @entity35 , she won the state 's primary			1
" she 's tough , " @entity230 , @entity172 's mayor at the time told the @entity143			0
" that 's a real @entity172 trait			0

@entity0 has key ties to four states : @entity5 , @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity35
@entity10 herself has not publicly shied away from citizenship in any of these states
@entity65 mayor @entity72 said @entity10 " will forever be a @entity65 at heart . "
@entity205 , @entity35 's governor elect , said her blood has " @entity35 values "
