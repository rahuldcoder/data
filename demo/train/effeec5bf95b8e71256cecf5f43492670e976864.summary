-- for the past 20 years , the copyright industry has waged a war against teenagers sharing culture and knowledge with each other			1
first , it was music ( " home taping will kill music " ) , then games , then movies , then books			0
the copyright industry has tried to portray the teenagers and others who are thus sharing as if they were somehow being immoral			2
the problem with this depiction is that it resonates very poorly with the people doing the actual sharing -- to them , sharing a record or a game with a friend or a stranger is a good social act			2

as mobile devices develop , it becomes increasingly clear that this is a war that can not be won			1
today , our mobile devices can typically house some 16 to 64 gigs of data			1
hard drives that can hold 60 terabytes have been announced and are just around the corner			0
as this storage capacity becomes affordable and even expected for one person to carry around , each and every person can hold a complete copy of all music ever produced			0

train and subway cars will form spontaneous clouds of connections that keep owners of mobile devices up - to - date with all music ever produced			1
shortly thereafter , personal storage capacities will also be enough to house all movies ever produced			0
regrettably , cellphones are a centralized , trackable technology -- they have been called " governmental tracking devices that you can also use to make phone calls " , and rightly so -- the built - in trackability possibilities are something that goes far beyond what existed east of the former @entity90			1
read related : on second thought : maybe smartphones make us ' @entity93 ' ? but mobile phones can also connect directly to each other , without central trackability , logs or traces -- as long as they are within short range of one another			2
" short range " usually means about 10 to 25 meters in practice			2
this kind of person - to - person distribution of digitizable material -- sometimes called a " sneakernet " , as people use their feet to move data -- is not as effective in distributing information as the internet , but effective enough			0
it 's how we shared primitive games on the early computers , before we had @entity117 , and before we had the internet			0
it took about three days for a new game from its release somewhere in the world to reach everybody who wanted it			0
so realizing that people can not be stopped from sharing knowledge and culture , in violation of the distribution monopoly we know as copyright , because of the rapid development of mobile devices -- seeing that it can not be stopped with any amount of applied violence , is there a flip side to this ? it turns out that there is a rather strong flip side			1
for the first time in history , all of humanity -- at least everybody with an internet connection , which is increasingly fast becoming " everybody " -- can access all of humanity 's collective knowledge and culture , as well as contribute freely to it			1
that is a huge leap ahead for us as a civilization			0

all the technology has already been developed , all the infrastructure has already been built , all the tools have already been rolled out			0
all that we have to do to achieve this leap of civilization is just to remove the ban on using the greatest library mankind has ever built			0
( ironically , the exact same discussion about sharing knowledge and culture was held when public libraries were introduced into law in the 1850s , when publishers had argued that people should be banned from lending books from one another			1
the more things change , the more they stay the same			0
) so not only can sharing not be stopped -- i argue that it should n't be stopped , either , once you see the flip side			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 is the *founder* of the @entity192 , the first @entity193 worldwide
he argues that the development of mobile devices makes it *impossible* to stop file - sharing
he argues this means almost everybody can access all of humanity 's collective knowledge and culture
