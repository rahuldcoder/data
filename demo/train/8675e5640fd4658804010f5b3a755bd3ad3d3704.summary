of all the speeches at the @entity3 convention in @entity4 , @entity5 , few offended conservative listeners more than the speech by @entity8			1
there are plenty of good reasons to be annoyed			0
from the conservative point of view , @entity8 is on the wrong side of a battle over religious freedom			1
back in march , she testified in favor of a proposed @entity18 administration rule that would require @entity20 institutions , like her own @entity22 law school , to reject the teaching of their church and cover contraception in their university health plans -- plans not funded by taxpayers , by the way , but by tuition and other university revenues			1
now here @entity8 was again , on the national stage , warning that a vote for the @entity36 ticket in 2012 was a vote for " an @entity37 in which you have a new vice president who co-sponsored a bill that would allow pregnant women to die preventable deaths in our emergency rooms			1
an @entity37 in which states humiliate women by forcing us to endure invasive ultrasounds we do n't want and our doctors say we do n't need			2
" an @entity37 in which access to birth control is controlled by people who will never use it ; in which politicians redefine rape so survivors are victimized all over again ; in which someone decides which domestic violence victims deserve help , and which do n't			1
" shortly before @entity8 spoke , conservative commentator @entity63 had tweeted : " @entity64 just impregnated @entity8 backstage			1
" that was nothing compared with the outpouring of fury during and after the speech			2
@entity71 , who hosts on the conservative internet video site @entity73 and appears on @entity75 's " @entity74 , " tweeted mid-speech : " tricky camera work to keep tv audience from seeing ( @entity80 ) @entity79 's hand up @entity8 's a * *			1
" the next day , @entity82 columnist and sometime @entity84 guest host @entity81 scoffed : " @entity8 has been blessed with a quarter - million dollars of elite education ... and she has concluded that the most urgent need facing the @entity87 in @entity88 is for someone else to pay for the contraception of 30 - year - old children			1
" @entity8 : slurs wo n't silence women @entity94 , columnist for the online edition of @entity96 , was nearly equally scathing			1
" seriously , the party of @entity98 and @entity99 and @entity100 chose to showcase someone whose claim to fame is that she demands that somebody else pay for her birth control			1
" within 48 hours , the attack had jumped from the conservative media sphere to electoral politics			2
campaigning in @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity36 congressional candidate @entity109 erupted : " think about this , a 31 - , 32 - year - old law student who has been a student for life , who gets up there in front of a national audience and tells the @entity37 people , ' i want @entity37 to pay for my contraceptives			0
' you 're kidding me			0
go get a job , @entity8			2
" there 's never any shortage of vitriol in political commentary , but usually it 's reserved for the headliners			0
yet @entity8 provoked more sputtering in five minutes than former president @entity64 did in a speech 10 times as long			1
why ? the answer takes us to the events that put @entity8 on the stage in @entity4 in the first place : @entity84 's brutal , sexualized attack on her congressional testimony			1
on the day after @entity8 spoke , @entity84 demanded : " what does it say about the college co-ed @entity8 , who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex , what does that make her ? it makes her a slut , right ? it makes her a prostitute			1
she wants to be paid to have sex			0
she 's having so much sex she ca n't afford the contraception			2
she wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex			0
what does that make us ? we 're the pimps			0
" @entity84 returned to the subject again and again , escalating his abuse over three consecutive days			2
" so miss @entity8 , and the rest of you feminazis , here 's the deal			1
if we are going to pay for your contraceptives , and thus pay for you to have sex , we want something for it			0
we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch			0
" after three days of this , advertisers began to drop his show -- and @entity84 was constrained to issue a grudging apology on his website			2
" for over 20 years , i have illustrated the absurd with absurdity , three hours a day , five days a week			0
in this instance , i chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation			0
i did not mean a personal attack on ms. @entity8			2
" i think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times , we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of @entity190			0
i personally do not agree that @entity37 citizens should pay for these social activities			0
what happened to personal responsibility and accountability ? where do we draw the line ? if this is accepted as the norm , what will follow ? will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit ? in my monologue , i posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone 's bedroom nor do i think it is a topic that should reach a presidential level			0
" my choice of words was not the best , and in the attempt to be humorous , i created a national stir			0
i sincerely apologize to ms. @entity8 for the insulting word choices			2
" in this grudging half - apology , half - justification , @entity84 misstated the facts of the case			2
taxpayer money was never at issue between @entity8 and @entity22			2
when @entity8 and her fellow students paid tuition to @entity22 , they got health coverage as part of the deal			1
at issue in @entity8 's congressional hearing were principles of religious freedom -- and the disposition of student health dollars -- but not taxpayer money			1
@entity84 's misstatement had the benefit of permitting him a change of subject -- and a way out of a damaging controversy			1
and it allowed his friends and supporters to pronounce the matter closed			0
yet somehow it did n't close : not for @entity8 , and not for @entity84 either			1
why this election is so personal other male commentators have used belittling , misogynistic language against other women in the public eye			0
both @entity36 and @entity3 women have found themselves on the receiving end of condescension and epithets			0
but @entity84 did something different with @entity8 : aggressively and deliberately , over a long span of days , because his own commercial interests require shock and controversy , @entity84 had promoted @entity8 into a totem and martyr			1
when @entity3 later claimed that @entity36 " waged war on women , " @entity84 's tirade became @entity270 -- at least until rep. @entity272 's " legitimate rape " comment demoted it to second place			1
at the time of the tirade , a number of @entity36 politicians spoke out against @entity84			2
@entity37 sen. @entity279 called @entity84 's comments " reprehensible " and former @entity282 candidate @entity281 condemned them as " insulting			1
" yet as time has passed , the regrets faded			0
an idea was born and grew that somehow @entity8 must have provoked what was said of her , must indeed have deserved it			2
@entity289 of @entity290 and @entity291 expressed this " she asked for it " view pungently in a march blog post : " of course @entity84 was being insulting			2
he was using it as a tool to highlight just how absurd the @entity3 ' position is on this			0
it 's what he does and does quite well			0
and in the process he 's exposing a lot of media bias on the issue as people rush out ( no pun intended ) to make @entity8 a victim of his insults and dance around precisely what is really insulting ? her testimony before congress that @entity37 taxpayers should subsidize the sexual habits of @entity318 students because , @entity319 forbid , they should stop having sex if they can not afford the pills themselves			1
" that mood , an undercurrent until recently , gushed into full view on the night of @entity8 's convention speech			1
if the words " slut " and " prostitute " are not to be used , she must nonetheless be the thing indicated by those not - to - be - used words : a woman whose sexuality is for sale			0
because if she 's not -- if she 's merely a concerned citizen who expressed in a public forum a diverging view of the appropriate relationship between church and state -- then what does that make @entity84 ? and what does it make those who rallied to defend @entity84 ? something pretty ugly , right ? which is why it remains today so urgently necessary for so many people to demean and defame this woman			1
the correct reply to @entity8 is that she is a person intolerant of the religious liberty of the @entity351			1
the @entity351 does good works on a vast national scale -- caring for the sick , teaching children , supporting the homeless -- all to uphold its compassionate doctrines in a harsh world			0
once government starts imposing its rules on a church , then it crushes the spirit that leads the church to do its good on the world			0
you can say all that without hurling accusations of nymphomania , freeloading and sexual exhibitionism			0
in fact , omitting such vile insults makes the rebuttal more convincing , not less			0
but that 's not how @entity84 does it , and he has taught a generation of conservative shock - mongers to do the same or worse			1
follow @ @entity377 on @entity378 .			0

@entity380 : @entity8 's speech at @entity382 *sparked* the most conservative outrage
it goes back to @entity84 's sexualized , brutal attacks on her after testimony , he says
@entity390 : @entity8 wanted her college insurance to cover birth control , funded by tuition , not taxes
@entity390 : disagree that religious schools *include* birth control in insurance , but do n't revile her
