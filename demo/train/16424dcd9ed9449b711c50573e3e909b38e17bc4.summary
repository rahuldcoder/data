@entity0 -- even as the war against @entity4 expands , house speaker @entity2 said he does n't believe @entity5 should debate any new authorization for the military operation until next year			1
in an interview with the @entity9 , @entity2 said he did n't believe holding a vote in november during the so - called lame - duck session of @entity5 was appropriate because there is " a whole group of members who are on their way out the door			1
" @entity2 delivered that same message to @entity18 in closed - door meetings before the @entity18 wrapped up its brief fall session last week , according to a top @entity2 aide			2
" he believes that having such a consequential debate with members who are either retiring or lost is not the right way to go about it , " @entity22 , @entity2 's communications director , told @entity1			1
the speaker has emphasized on multiple occasions that he does n't believe lame - duck sessions are the right time to tackle major policy debates such as immigration or tax reform			1
will @entity34 strikes hurt @entity4 ' oil riches ? but both @entity36 and @entity37 have argued that the legal justification that the @entity40 administration cites to launch action against @entity4 -- a 2001 measure passed by @entity5 to fight @entity43 and the 2002 @entity45 war authorization -- does n't cover the current military action against this terror group			1
some members , including @entity36 , want @entity2 to call the @entity18 back into session before the mid-term election to vote on a new authorization			2
@entity53 @entity36 rep. @entity52 told @entity54 thursday that it 's time for @entity5 to return to @entity0 and take up new legislation focused on the fight against @entity4			0
" we are shirking our responsibility by not voting on this , " she said			0
@entity62 spokesman on fighting @entity4 : ' i think we are in this for a matter of years ' but @entity2 , who is on a campaign swing for @entity36 candidates in @entity68 this week , made it clear he has no plans to do so			0
the @entity18 speaker did tell the @entity9 -- as he said before @entity5 left for the final stretch before the november mid-term elections -- that he believes it 's important for @entity5 to " speak " on the issue			1
but he insisted it 's up to the @entity18 to draft and send new language to @entity78			0
" i would suggest to you that early next year , assuming that we continue in this effort , there may be that discussion and there may be that request from the president , " @entity2 said			0
sen. @entity87 , @entity88 , who could become majority leader if @entity36 win control of the @entity91 in november , did n't have a comment about @entity2 's remarks			2
but his spokesman @entity94 told @entity1 that @entity102 " has said multiple times that the president should present us with a plan and we can vote on that and if it 's a good plan it will have bipartisan support			0
" @entity1 senior congressional producer @entity103 contributed to this story .			0

debate in @entity5 over war authorization likely would n't happen until next year
that 's according to house speaker @entity2
having the debate in a lame - duck session would be *inefficient* , @entity2 believes
