-- smartphone owners may have to ask themselves : why text when there 's @entity4 ? that 's a question the cellular carriers will lament as the biggest technology players pile into what 's known as the mobile - messaging space			1
@entity10 joined the fray on tuesday with the release of @entity13 and @entity14			1
@entity10 's @entity16 feature , which allows people to communicate privately with friends on the social network and recently with e-mail acquaintances , is already built into the @entity10 apps			1
however , the new standalone messenger software is a cornerstone for @entity10 's ambition to become the communications hub on phones , @entity10 employees working on the messaging product have said in interviews			1
to design the app , @entity10 acquired the development team that built a program called @entity33			1
it allows users to include photos and location coordinates with each message and can also send text messages to phone numbers , much like the new @entity10 app. @entity41 , a @entity10 product director , discussed the potential need for a dedicated client in an march interview , days after the @entity33 engineers started at the @entity46 , @entity47 , company			1
" one click from the home screen is a valuable trait , " he said , contrasted with the need to open the full @entity10 app in order seek new messages			1
" they 've built specifically for mobile - to - mobile			1
our messages stuff was built for a convergence between mobile and @entity62 and e-mail and a bunch of other things			2
" @entity41 suggested that a standalone messenger was " the next step " in @entity10 's plans			1
as it turns out , it was			2
but cell operators , which derive substantial profits from texting plans and per - message fees , stand in the way , @entity41 said			2
how they manage their sms networks is viewed by tech visionaries as controlled , stifling			1
( @entity78 stands for @entity78 , another name for texting			2
) @entity10 is made up of people who breathe the hacker ethos			1
earlier this summer , for example , @entity10 hired @entity84 , aka @entity84 , who hacked @entity86 and @entity87 software			1
networks should be malleable , these people often say			2
" sms to @entity78 : those are controlled by the carriers , " @entity41 said during the interview from march			2
" that 's a closed loop			2
" @entity94 , whose founders famously built " blue box " equipment decades ago for enabling free phone calls , much to the chagrin of telecom firms , apparently buy into this thinking as well			0
this fall , @entity94 will bundle a mobile app called @entity104 into @entity86 , @entity105 and @entity106 , which can bypass cell carrier infrastructure granting free text messages to other users of @entity94 devices			1
similarly , @entity111 has @entity112			0
and @entity113 provides two services : @entity115 , which is part of the @entity118 social network , and @entity119			0
a dedicated app can be deployed on , say , your mother 's smartphone in order to ween her off of @entity126 's or @entity127 ' texting services and into a free communication network that uses minute amounts of data			1
" to people , it 's a bridge -- like , ' oh , i already know how this works			0
this is great , ' " @entity41 said			0
these types of apps " are taking sms and moving it away from that closed - loop thing and into another space , " he added			0
" this is an area that 's very exciting and hot and interesting , " @entity41 said			0
" i do n't think anyone has the answer yet			0
i think @entity16 is the very likely substrate upon which these things end up operating			0
" an @entity126 spokesman declined to comment			0
@entity127 has said it intends to eventually move all of its services onto its next - generation @entity150 data network			0
the company has n't said how it would price the different features			0
software alternatives to texting could pose a threat to existing money makers , but carriers must find or create other worthwhile channels to charge for , @entity127 marketing chief @entity153 said in an interview in january			1
" we 'll always be in a place where we have to evolve how we generate revenue for the business , " @entity160 said			0
" but we 're not going to run away from the innovation that 's happening out there			0
we 're going to make sure we innovate it better , or integrate it better on our devices than anyone else , as opposed to putting up a walled garden			0
" to that , the technorati might say : lol .			0
