@entity0 -- @entity3 voters under 40 share a simple reality -- for most of their lives , a @entity6 or @entity7 has been president			0
the 20 - year streak began with @entity10 @entity6 's inauguration in january 1989 and ran through two terms for @entity12 @entity7 and then two for @entity6 's son , @entity13 , until @entity14 took office in january 2009			1
now the latest polling indicates the next presidential election in 2016 may again offer familiar choices			1
a @entity1 / @entity20 survey released monday showed @entity21 -- the former first lady , @entity3 senator and secretary of state -- way ahead of any other potential @entity25 challenger , with @entity26 -- the former two - term @entity27 governor who is son of one president and brother of another -- among the top @entity10			1
no one can say for sure if either will even run , and anything can happen in the more than two years before either would actually get nominated			0
poll : if not @entity7 , then what kind of @entity12 ? but if such a race happens , it would mean that at the end of the winner 's first term in 2020 , either a @entity7 or a @entity6 would have occupied the @entity41 for 24 of the previous 32 years			2
even @entity42 , @entity26 's mom , thinks that 's too much			1
she told @entity44 last month that " if we ca n't find more than two or three families to run for high office , that 's silly			0
" family spokesman : @entity42 was n't telling @entity26 not to run both candidates boast strong pedigrees due to their names and experience			1
the question is whether their political lineage will be a boon or a burden two years from now			0
the early thinking is that @entity7 's historic goal to be the first woman president better immunizes her from what analysts call possible name fatigue among voters			2
" it is a good bet that women would propel @entity21 forward , while @entity26 would be left behind , " said @entity66 , a political scientist at @entity68			1
" both @entity7 and @entity6 would be saddled with last names that incite mixed emotions among current voters , but she has a natural demographic constituency that he lacks			2
" in particular , " women vote in greater numbers than men and there is an 11 % gender gap in favor of @entity25 , which means that even @entity7 fatigue can be overcome in a presidential election , " @entity66 added			1
@entity21 's understudy waits in the wings a @entity26 candidacy would make its own history , noted @entity1 polling director @entity86			1
" there have been plenty of presidential candidates whose fathers also ran for president , and a few whose brothers have been candidates , " @entity86 said			0
" but if @entity26 throws his hat in the ring , he will be the first candidate in history who fits into both categories			1
does that help because the @entity6 ' brand name ' is well known , or hurt because @entity26 would be judged by the public based on things he did not do himself ? historically speaking , there is no way to tell			1
" @entity26 on 2016 decision : ' can i do it joyfully ? ' he said one difference between @entity21 and @entity26 involves final impressions of their familial @entity110 predecessors			1
" @entity7 's husband was fairly popular in his last year or so in office and that was n't true for @entity6 's brother or his father , " @entity86 said			0
incumbent @entity6 got thumped by @entity7 in the 1992 election , due to breaking a pledge against new taxes as well as the third party candidacy of @entity121 who got 19 % of the vote to presumably siphon off @entity10 support			1
@entity13 had an approval rating in the mid- 30s when his second term ended amid two wars and a recession			0
after generally refusing to acknowledge any interest in a @entity110 run , @entity26 last week suddenly said he would think about it			2
" i 'm deferring the decision to the right time , which is later this year , " he said			2
" and the decision will be based on can i do it joyfully , because i think we need to have candidates lift our spirits			0
" " something switched in @entity26 , " noted @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity139 , pointing out that instead of distancing himself from the question , @entity6 now offered a timetable for a decision and a thematic basis that " you have to be joyful , you have to get uplifted , you 've got to be optimistic			1
" his shift in stance coincided with political woes facing @entity149 gov. @entity148 , the early @entity10 favorite now facing multiple investigations over suggestions officials in his administration abused their power			1
@entity155 : @entity10 race for 2016 is wide open the @entity1 / @entity20 poll showed a pack of potential @entity10 contenders in a statistical dead heat so early in the process , including former @entity163 gov. @entity162 , sen. @entity164 of @entity165 , @entity6 and @entity148 , closely trailed by sen. @entity166 of @entity27 and rep. @entity167 of @entity168 , the @entity10 vice-presidential nominee in 2012			1
as recently as november , @entity148 had an 11 - percentage - point lead			0
@entity1 chief political analyst @entity170 said @entity6 likely feared name fatigue when he decided against mounting a presidential bid in 2012			0
" so the question is , if you skip ahead , four more years , will there still be @entity6 fatigue ? " @entity170 wondered , adding : " we just do n't know			0
" to @entity66 , a @entity6 campaign would bring calls by his @entity10 rivals for fresh blood			2
" you can bet that within the @entity10 , every other remotely viable candidate , from @entity167 to @entity164 to @entity185 and maybe still @entity148 will adopt a campaign slogan that calls for new leadership , and a brand new last name in the @entity110 , " she said			2
@entity167 : ' not closing my options ' on 2016 @entity7 , meanwhile , has her own political baggage that @entity10 strategists will attempt to exploit fully , including her husband 's affair with a @entity110 intern while in office and the september 2012 attack in @entity198 , @entity199 , that killed the @entity3 ambassador and three other @entity3 on her watch as secretary of state			1
@entity7 spokesman says tweet was ' 100 % humor ' @entity21 tweets viral @entity207 joke , right blitzes back conservatives relentlessly attack her over the lack of sufficient security in @entity198 as well as the failure to respond in time to save @entity3 lives			2
they also accuse the @entity14 administration of trying to deceive the @entity3 public by first blaming the attack on a spontaneous protest instead of a full - fledged terrorist assault			0
@entity7 's biggest regret at @entity221 : @entity198 senators : @entity198 attack ' likely preventable ' @entity14 faced tough grilling on the matter before sunday 's @entity207 in a live interview with @entity228 host @entity227 , with the president eventually saying that some people believe what he called the false notion of a politically inspired cover - up " because folks like you are telling them that			0
" according to the @entity1 / @entity20 poll , 62 % of respondents approve of the job @entity7 did at the @entity240 , down 4 percentage points from december 2012 -- a month before she stepped down as @entity3 's top diplomat			0
" if the election were held in 2014 , i think both @entity7 and @entity6 would suffer from name fatigue stemming from an overall high level of dissatisfaction with government and all who have been part of it , " @entity66 said , citing a recent @entity252 poll that found 65 % of respondents dissatisfied with how well the government works			0
" it is not a malaise , " @entity66 added , calling it " a more energetic level of discontent , and anyone viewed as establishment on the left or the right is vulnerable to it			0
" @entity6 's biggest problem may be his own mother			0
" i hope he wo n't , " @entity42 said in the @entity44 interview about a possible @entity26 run , reiterating the theme she sounded last year on @entity270 when she said : " we 've had enough @entity272			1
" @entity1 's @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
