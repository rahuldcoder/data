-- the @entity2 has given notice to the @entity4 that it will pull all funding to the group starting in 2015 because of a @entity4 membership policy that bans gay leaders , the entertainment company said friday			1
@entity9 does not give money directly to the national organization or local @entity4 councils			1
however , through its @entity13 , @entity9 allows employees to do volunteer work in exchange for cash donations to the charities of their choice			1
employees taking part in the @entity13 will no longer be able to submit the funds to the @entity4 , the organization said			2
the new policy will not affect @entity9 employees who volunteer with the @entity4 , the company said			1
" we believe every child deserves the opportunity to be a part of the @entity34 experience , and we are disappointed in this decision because it will impact our ability to serve kids , " @entity4 spokesman @entity27 said in a statement			1
" @entity40 's youth need scouting , and by continuing to focus on the goals that unite us , we continue to accomplish incredible things for young people and the communities we serve			0
" though the @entity4 voted last year to allow gay youths to join its ranks , the group maintains a ban on gay @entity34 leaders			0
according to @entity9 's charitable giving guidelines , groups become ineligible to receive @entity9 funding if they " discriminate in the provision of services unlawfully or in a manner inconsistent with @entity9 's policies on the basis of race , religion , color , sex , national origin , age , marital status , mental or physical ability , or sexual orientation			0
" @entity9 would not divulge its formula for converting volunteer hours to dollars , but a chart on @entity9 's corporate website shows that in 2010 , employees raised $ 4.8 million via 548,000 volunteer hours , which works out to $ 8.79 an hour			1
among the events for which employees volunteered were a triathlon for @entity77 , the @entity78 for cancer , @entity80 at @entity81 and the @entity82 at @entity83 for the @entity84 , according to @entity9			2
@entity85 , the director of workplace equality for the @entity87 , said @entity9 's decision " carries a unique weight			2
when you think about brands that exemplify childhood , you think of @entity9 , and with them dissociating with @entity4 , it speaks volumes of where we are with the views we want to send to young people			2
" in a recent report , @entity87 cited numerous victories in its quest to ensure workplace equality and applauded the majority of @entity105 companies that now offer sexual - orientation and gender - identity protections to their employees			0
despite that , " we know that over 50 % of ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) employees remain closeted on the job , " the report said			0
on thursday , @entity116 , which says it works to end discrimination within the @entity4 , praised @entity118 for ending local support for the @entity4 's @entity120			0
" we 're never happy to see @entity34 suffer as a result of the @entity4 's anti-gay policy , but @entity9 made the right decision to withhold support until scouting is fully inclusive , " @entity122 co-founder @entity121 said in a statement			1
@entity116 says @entity9 joins @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 as companies who have ended partnerships with the @entity4 because of its policy			1
@entity85 said @entity138 and @entity139 are also on that list			0
openly gay youth now welcome in @entity4			0

a @entity9 *program* allowed employees to give to the @entity4 , but no more
" we are disappointed in the decision , " @entity4 spokesman says
@entity2 says its employees raised $ 4.8 million for charities in 2010
@entity9 joins @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity133 in ending @entity4 partnership
