-- @entity1 's became @entity3 's highest goalscorer of all time after his hat - trick against @entity6 helped the @entity8 champions close on @entity10 leaders @entity11			1
the @entity13 striker , who is still only 24 years old , took his tally to 234 goals for the club to overtake @entity17 , who had a prolific spell for @entity3 in the 1940s and ' 50s			1
@entity1 took his tally for the season to 54 in 45 games as @entity3 's 5 - 3 victory on tuesday helped cut the gap to rivals real to just five points			1
@entity3 have played a game more than @entity11 , but now the second league " @entity28 " of the season between the two clubs scheduled for april 22 looks increasingly pivotal in the title race			2
" we are witnessing the best player in every sense , " said @entity1 's coach @entity32			2
" he does everything , and he does it every three days			0
" i 'm sorry for those that want to sit on his throne , but this lad is the best			0
hopefully we can enjoy his football for many more years			0
" @entity32 compared @entity1 's dominance in football to the basketball supremacy of @entity47 legend @entity46			2
" @entity48 has rightfully entered into history , " he said			0
" there are few players that dominate in this fashion , and he does it			0
" a recent study by @entity3 's @entity56 discovered that @entity17 had scored 232 goals in competitive matches , not 235 as previously thought			1
and @entity1 wasted little time in equaling @entity17 's tally , with a crisp volley after @entity62 's cross had fallen to him on the right edge of the box after 17 minutes			1
his opening goal made it 2 - 0 on the night after @entity1 had teed up @entity67 midfielder @entity66 for the first after only six minutes			0
but @entity6 -- placed 15th in the 20 - team division -- stunned @entity3 in the second half as @entity71 headed a free - kick past @entity73 before @entity74 drew a foul from @entity76 in the box and @entity78 fired home from the penalty spot			1
the visitors were n't level for long as @entity76 floated a ball over their defense for @entity1 , who controlled and lobbed @entity6 goalkeeper @entity17 to spark a prolonged round of celebrations with his teammates			1
@entity87 added a fifth for @entity3 when he slotted home in the final 10 minutes after @entity1 had been denied by @entity17			1
the gloss was removed ever so slightly from @entity1 's record - breaking night when @entity76 was sent off after conceding another penalty , converted by @entity92 , and defender @entity93 was sidelined for 10 days with a leg injury			1
in @entity10 's other game on tuesday , @entity95 moved into sixth place in the table despite drawing 0 - 0 with @entity99 , who remain 11th			2
elsewhere , @entity101 booked a place in the @entity104 final after @entity106 's extra-time strike sealed a 4 - 3 aggregate win over @entity108			1
leading 2 - 1 from the first leg , @entity101 edged further ahead when veteran striker @entity110 scored on 28 minutes but @entity112 leaders @entity108 hit back with goals from @entity114 and @entity115 to force an extra half an hour			2
but @entity106 's goal five minutes into the extra period settled the tie			0
@entity101 will face either @entity120 or @entity121 in the final -- they play on wednesday with @entity120 trailing 2 - 1 from the first leg			0
meanwhile , @entity123 boosted their hopes of @entity126 survival with a 2 - 0 win over @entity128 at @entity129			0
striker @entity130 opened the scoring with a 58th - minute volley to record his third goal in two games before a late @entity136 header sealed back - to - back wins for @entity123 , who moved six points clear of the drop zone .			0

@entity1 becomes highest scorer in @entity3 's history after hat - trick against @entity6
@entity13 striker 's *treble* helps @entity3 to a 5 - 3 win to close on @entity10 leaders @entity11
@entity1 's haul takes his tally to 234 for the club , past @entity17 's long - held record
the 24 - year - old has 54 goals for the @entity8 and @entity159 champions this season
