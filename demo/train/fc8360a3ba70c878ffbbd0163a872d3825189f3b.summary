in @entity2 , more than 28 million people in the country are without electricity			1
to put that into perspective , the entire population of the beautiful landlocked east - central @entity7 nation is less than 38 million people			2
to tackle energy poverty , many entrepreneurs are increasingly devising innovative solutions to explore feasible alternative power options			1
one of them is @entity16			2
having grown up in both urban and rural areas of @entity2 , @entity16 knew first hand the challenges faced by many homes when it came to cooking a simple meal			1
a passionate environmentalist , she decided to do something about it			2
in 2009 , she teamed up with her brother to found their @entity28 - based company with their flagship product : the " eco stove			1
" the siblings ' green oven uses a type of volcanic rock combined with solar power to act as the fuel for the kitchen appliance			1
@entity40 food , charge your phone " the whole point was to ... reduce deforestation , as well as the chores involved in finding firewood for the local person who ca n't access electricity or gas , " explains @entity43			1
the stove has an internal air system that helps heat up the volcanic rocks , which are ready to cook when they turn bright red in color			2
when the device is switched off , the rocks cool and return to their natural state until the next use			0
meanwhile , solar panels on the appliance charge up and help provide additional heat to the stove			1
alternatively , @entity43 explains , the appliance can also be used to provide an additional light source , charge cell phones , play a radio or even iron clothes through steaming			1
at the moment , the most common solid fuels for cooking and heating homes in @entity2 are firewood and charcoal , both of which release thick , acrid smoke into the household			1
this exposes residents to a number of respiratory health problems -- the @entity84 estimates that 4.3 million people die annually as a result of hazardous household air pollution			0
as the @entity2 capital of @entity28 continues to flourish more people are choosing to relocate to the city			1
but an increasing population also means more man - made health factors			2
societal problems include extra trash and traffic , which in turn add to the worsening air pollution			0
outside of the city , in rural areas , the once green and fertile forests are disappearing at an alarming rate			0
deforestation has seen the country lose two thirds of its forests between 1990 and 2005 making it harder for villagers to find wood for burning			0
@entity16 hopes her product will provide users with immediate environmental , social , health and economic benefits once they have upgraded their existing kitchens with her eco-alternative			2
part businesswoman , part eco-warrior she says : " everybody says i want ( the eco stove ) because charcoal is expensive , firewood is hard to find , electricity is very expensive and its not reliable			1
" surrounded by countless families facing these hardships of accessing sustainable energy everyday , @entity16 made it her mission to provide a reliable fuel source through her social enterprise startup			1
it 's a vision that has proved fairly popular as more @entity28 residents adopt this eco-friendly way of cooking			1
but @entity43 explains it usually requires a live demonstration of the product to clinch the sale			0
" this is a new innovation in the continent that a lot of people need more understanding			0
it 's not something that you can go on tv and say ' this a stove here that will solve all your cooking challenges			0
' no ! " that 's why we are always cooking beans ( outside the store )			0
you need a lot of stuff on site to be able to demonstrate for anybody who comes in , because it 's not something somebody is going to read about it and say ' a stone that cooks and lasts two years ' and believe in it			0
no -- they want to see			0
" it 's still early days but the sustainable business has seen some local success in promoting renewable energy -- a cause of great importance to @entity16			1
and it 's this passion that spurs the environmental entrepreneur onwards			0
she explains : " believe in the dream ( and ) i think you 'll go all the way			0
once you believe in it it 's easy to transmit the same passion and the same conviction to the person who is going to buy into it			0
" once you believe in what you 're doing , do n't be distracted and do n't even be discouraged			0
