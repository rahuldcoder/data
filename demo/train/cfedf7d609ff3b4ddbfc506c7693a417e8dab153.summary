@entity0 -- sixteen years is a long time , but " it still feels just like yesterday " to 39 - year - old @entity3			2
her father disappeared while flying home from @entity6 , @entity7 , to @entity8 , @entity9 , in february 1996			1
" i honestly do not know where the time has gone , " she said this week , as efforts continued to determine whether plane wreckage recently found 80 feet down in the @entity12 20 miles off the coast of @entity14 , @entity15 , will answer her family 's uncertainty			1
" i may or may not find my answers in my search , but i really feel like i am not alone searching , " she said			2
read more : underwater wreckage could provide answer to missing - plane mystery on february 17 , 1996 , @entity3 ' father , @entity27 , was piloting his twin engine @entity30 home after going to show the plane to a prospective buyer who failed to show up for the scheduled appointment			1
shortly after he took off around 7:45 p.m. , @entity27 , 58 , reported feeling dizzy and said he was having trouble seeing			1
he radioed a distress call and advised the radio control tower in @entity37 , @entity15 , of his coordinates			1
in what would be his last communication , he said he was placing the plane on autopilot and turning toward the ocean			2
then , several weeks ago , diver @entity44 and another diver came across plane parts which @entity3 hopes will shed more light on where and how her father 's plane disappeared			1
@entity44 posted video and photos on his company 's website , hoping it might draw attention from aviation buffs			1
see the photos and videos @entity3 , who routinely checks the internet for any news about missing aircraft , heard about the plane wreckage and decided she wanted to meet the 31 - year - old @entity44 before he made the dive to further investigate the wreckage			1
" this could be it			2
this dive could be what ultimately answers 16 years of not knowing , " @entity3 e-mailed to @entity1 prior to her face - to - face meeting with @entity44			1
" if it is my @entity72 's plane , i want to ( meet ) the man before he goes to find that my @entity72 has actually touched the face of @entity75			1
somehow it seems comforting to me			2
" " i guess i feel like if i ca n't be the person to go dive down there and find the answers myself , then what i really want is for that person to at least know me and more about my @entity72 and what an incredible person my @entity72 is , " she said			1
" right now , to me , my @entity72 is still alive , so this for me could be my goodbye			2
" the weather looks favorable this weekend for @entity44 and a volunteer search and recovery team from @entity90 ( think it sink it reef it ) , a marine conservation company based in @entity37 , which has unexpectedly found itself in the middle of an underwater mystery , far from its main mission to help build artificial reefs			1
on wednesday afternoon , @entity3 drove the three - and - a - half hours that separates her home from the man who might provide the closure she 's looking for			1
@entity44 and @entity3 both predicted their first meeting would be emotional			2
" i was greeted by a man with a very sweet smile and what started as a handshake turned into a comforting hug , " she reflected			0
" i instantly felt comfortable like i had known him for years			0
" she said she could tell instantly @entity44 takes a lot of pride in what he does			0
" for me to see her kinda stepped things up a level , " @entity44 later said			0
" through our conversation ... you would see the hope and the sadness at the same time			0
seeing her emotions was very motivating for us			0
" but he also did n't want to raise expectations			0
" he was very careful to not give me false hopes , " she said			0
but @entity3 said it was important that @entity44 knows everything about her father			1
" this is n't just anyone he is diving down there looking for			0
this could be my @entity72			0
@entity44 could be diving down to find the last answer i may need			0
i want to know @entity44			0
" wishful thinking aside , the two principals in this drama were realistic about how it may turn out			0
the chances that this is the plane are hard to know because no one saw exactly where it went down			0
not long after communications were lost with @entity27 , fighter jets were scrambled			1
a @entity144 jet based in @entity145 , @entity9 , went out as soon as the report came in while the plane was still over land , @entity3 recalls			0
then two @entity149 's were scrambled including one off a @entity151 ship to relieve the @entity152 's @entity144 which was running low on fuel			1
" the first jet did get a visual , " said @entity3 , but since night had fallen , the pilot was unable to see inside the cockpit , lit only by the light from the instrument panel			2
" from what i understood , the two c - 130 jets never could find him again			0
this has always led me to believe his @entity30 may not have stayed on the course they predicted with his last known coordinates and estimated fuel expiration recorded in his flight plan			0
" one of the more emotional moments during their three - hour meeting occurred when @entity44 pulled out of a bag a piece of the @entity174 engine retrieved during the initial dive last month			2
" she held it in her hand knowing this could be a piece of her father 's plane , " said @entity44			1
" i got a little tearful looking at this sand and shell encrusted piece of wreckage balanced in @entity44 's hand			1
that was a moment where the reality of there is really wreckage down there and it could be my @entity72 's kinda merged into my reality			1
seeing that piece was at best indescribable , " @entity3 said			0
@entity44 said the plan is for a team of at least six divers to go down three times for up to 30 minutes each on saturday and then again on sunday			0
@entity44 said they will use saturday 's dive to locate , mark and rig cables to the two engines which are 38 feet apart and 75 % buried in the sand			1
using lift bags that are like giant inflatable pillows provided free of charge by two companies , @entity208 and @entity209 , @entity44 will attempt to place the two engines on blocks on the level sea floor to get a better look at the motors , the propellers and any possible serial numbers			0
each of the propellers on the two engines of @entity27 's plane had three blades			1
" if that engine comes out and it 's a two - bladed prop , we can pretty much conclude it was not @entity3 's father 's plane , " @entity44 said			1
" if it 's three - bladed , it means more investigation			2
" ironically , @entity1 coverage about the plane 's disappearance and dive has resulted in more than a dozen other families contacting @entity44 , wondering if perhaps the plane wreckage is related to their missing loved ones			1
whether it turns out to be @entity27 's plane , @entity44 said , " the goal is to identify the plane			1
it wo n't change anything on our end			0
" " if it is not his plane , then it is somebody else 's answer , someone else 's closure , " @entity3 said			1
@entity44 said his company and others are shouldering the costs of the search			0
" every dollar spent is a financial loss as it is not like we are recovering treasure or goods of fiscal value			0
the hope of providing someone or some family closure is keeping us motivated and moving forward regardless , " he acknowledges			2
" the reality will most likely be that we will be unable to pursue investigations ( after this weekend ) without support of fiscal sponsors			2
" back at her home in @entity8 , waiting to see what @entity44 finds , @entity3 can only wonder			0
she said she 's going to drive back to @entity37 this weekend			1
" you know i sit in my dad 's old chair , i still have his hair brush , i even have an old undershirt sealed in a ziplock bag that still has his smell , but i do n't have him			2
i never got to say goodbye , " she said			0
" i have so many things that he touched and that were his , but so far none of these things has been enough to take away this pain of just not knowing			0
