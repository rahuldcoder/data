the @entity0 love their red cups , according to the @entity2 , which on monday named @entity3 the top party school in the nation			1
" i 'm excited about it , " said @entity6 , a junior information technology and philosophy major from @entity9 , @entity10			0
" i was definitely a little surprised , but it 's a cool title to have			1
" the university administration does not share his joy			0
" @entity3 has a long - established reputation for academic excellence with programs that are nationally and internationally the best in their fields , " the school said in a statement on its website			1
" we do not aspire to be a party school			1
" rounding out the top five schools were last year 's winner , the @entity27 ; @entity28 ; @entity29 ; and the @entity30 at @entity30			1
and apparently , the title means something			2
@entity33 , who is set to begin his final semester at the @entity27 this fall , told @entity34 that he and his fellow @entity35 were quite aware of being the " no. 1 party school " and frequently bragged about it			2
@entity27 has ranked among the top five schools for four years straight			1
" we took pride in it , " he said			0
" it 's always nice to know that your school has a good atmosphere and you want a fun campus to be on			2
" " win or lose , @entity48 still booze , " he said , quoting a popular saying			1
however , @entity33 and other @entity27 students stressed the title also had a negative connotation for parents , administration and people from other schools			1
and they said it frequently distracted from the first - class education they received in @entity60			0
@entity61 graduated this spring from the university with a degree in social work			0
" it was the best four years of my life , " she said			0
" but when you have a reputation as a party school , you also want your school to have a good reputation for education as well			2
" " i 'm also going to be a professional			0
" @entity73 said he understood those concerns , as well as school officials ' disappointment , and said he worried that " partying would overshadow @entity3 's academic success			1
" however , this has n't stopped some current students from being overjoyed			0
@entity73 said the only worry is that school administration will overcompensate with disciplinary action to limit student enjoyment			2
" the second the news broke , everyone was pretty pumped , " he said			0
" i 've never seen anything chaotic and do n't really think the school needs to do more to limit partying			0
... it 's pretty controlled			2
" the title now rests in the @entity95 , but @entity61 does n't expect @entity3 to hold onto it long			1
frankly , she sees midwestern schools as the collegiate party capital of @entity100			1
