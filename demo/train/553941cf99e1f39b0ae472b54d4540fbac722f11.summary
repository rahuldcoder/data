it 's time for the @entity1 and its @entity3 allies to raise or fold			0
@entity5 president @entity4 clearly called their bluff on tuesday , announcing steps for his country to annex the @entity10 from neighboring @entity11			1
president @entity12 and @entity3 allies had warned such a move would bring tougher sanctions and diplomatic isolation , but there was little immediate response tuesday to @entity4 's bold pronouncement in the @entity5 parliament			1
the @entity21 announced that @entity12 invited leaders of the @entity24 industrial powers to meet next week on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in the @entity27 to discuss the @entity11 crisis			1
presumably , such a gathering by @entity12 and his counterparts from @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 would consider scrapping their annual summit with @entity5 planned for july in @entity39 , and perhaps kicking @entity4 out of the @entity41 club altogether			1
both moves have been threatened , with the @entity24 nations already halting preparations for the @entity39 meeting			2
@entity41 in doubt ? @entity21 spokesman @entity47 strongly hinted tuesday that it would get scrapped , telling reporters that " preparations for that summit have been suspended , summits do n't occur without preparations " and " those preparations look unlikely to resume any time soon			0
" on monday , @entity12 and the @entity55 imposed sanctions on specific @entity5 and @entity10 officials as part of steps intended to be easily expanded if necessary			1
@entity47 said the moves already hurt the @entity5 economy and the ruble currency , and he indicated further actions were coming			0
" you have seen some designations already and there are more to come , " he said of individuals cited for sanctions			0
" i would n't , if i were you , invest in @entity5 equities right now unless you were going short , " @entity47 advised , in reference to investors speculating on a losing venture			0
however , @entity47 made clear that the @entity1 approach focused for now on isolating @entity5 diplomatically and economically			0
" this action -- the results of the referendum and the attempts to annex a region of @entity11 illegally -- will never be recognized by the @entity1 " and the international community , he said , with " further actions , further provocations " by @entity5 leading to " higher costs			2
" secretary of state @entity83 had a more reflective take , telling a town hall - style meeting that the administration still hoped for a diplomatic solution " but today was very confrontational and very triumphalist about something that is a breach of international law , and i think people are deeply concerned about it			2
" @entity93 : @entity10 was a " land grab " meanwhile , vice president @entity93 began a tour of former @entity97 bloc nations now @entity99 allies by pledging the full support of the strategic alliance against any @entity5 aggression similar to what has occurred in @entity11			1
" our intent is that @entity99 emerge from this crisis stronger and more unified than ever , " @entity93 said at his first stop in @entity105			0
" our commitment is absolutely unwavering and unshakeable			0
" he noted the @entity1 deployed more jet fighters in the region to bolster @entity99 air policing , and he called @entity4 's moves to add @entity10 to the @entity5 a " blatant , blatant violation of international law " and " nothing more than a land grab			1
" speaking to reporters at a joint news conference with @entity122 prime minister @entity121 , @entity93 said @entity5 responded to @entity11 's efforts to realize a more democratic future " with a brazen , brazen military incursion , with a purposeful ratcheting up of ethnic tensions inside @entity11 , with a rushed and illegal referendum in @entity10 that was , not surprisingly , rejected by virtually the entire world			1
" @entity93 also warned @entity130 that its political and economic isolation will increase if it continues such aggression , and he reiterated support for @entity11 in the form of a billion - dollar loan guarantee as well as technical assistance to prepare for elections and support for reforms that will allow the @entity140 to provide a stabilization package to the cash - strapped country			1
the vice president 's visit comes two days before @entity55 leaders will meet in @entity147 for talks certain to include the @entity11 crisis			1
@entity4 unfazed so far for his part , @entity4 appeared unfazed by the initial @entity1 and @entity55 steps , telling the parliament on tuesday that @entity5 already races lingering sanctions from the @entity155 that still exist in practice			0
he called the events that led to last month 's ouster of @entity11 president @entity159 a " state coup " carried out through " terror and murders and pogroms " by " @entity164 and anti-semites			0
" the @entity1 rejects @entity4 's characterization of the @entity11 political upheaval , instead calling it a demonstration of democratic aspirations by the @entity11 people			2
underlying the conflict was @entity159 's moves prior to his ouster to align more closely with @entity130 instead of proceeding with a shift toward closer association with the @entity55			0
opinion : @entity12 ca n't have it both ways on @entity10 @entity180 critics at home at home , @entity12 has come under criticism from republicans who complain an unwillingness by the administration to take on @entity4 on other issues has now emboldened the @entity5 leader			1
conservative sen. @entity190 of @entity191 called for more sanctions against @entity5 and increased assistance for @entity11 , a stance backed by @entity21 majority leader @entity195 of @entity196			0
" i support the president 's decision to issue sanctions against @entity5 leaders , but that list must be dramatically expanded to exert real pressure , " @entity195 said tuesday , also urging that @entity5 be kicked out of @entity41 and for the @entity1 to provide military support needed by @entity11 .			2
