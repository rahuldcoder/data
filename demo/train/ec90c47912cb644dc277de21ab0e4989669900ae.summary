-- april 27 , 1994 , was the crowning moment in the life of @entity3 -- the day @entity4 held its first elections open to citizens of every race			1
his @entity8 swept to power with 63 % of the vote			0
@entity13 's @entity12 got 20 % and the @entity15 party netted 10 %			2
in his victory speech , @entity3 said : " now is the time for celebration , for @entity4 to join together to celebrate the birth of democracy			1
" i raise a glass to you all for working so hard to achieve what can only be called a small miracle			0
" many agreed it was a miracle -- from world leaders to ordinary @entity4 voters -- considering the turmoil and segregation entrenched in @entity4 just a few years before			0
@entity3 's compassion and political shrewdness helped bring about this change			1
but most of all , it was the complete lack of bitterness he displayed for the 27 years he was imprisoned by the apartheid regime that enabled him to win over his divided nation and charm the world with his statesmanship			1
@entity3 and his government inherited a country devastated by decades of apartheid -- a policy of segregation and discrimination that aimed to keep black and white apart in every sphere of life -- as well as a black majority coming to terms with the fact that voting did not guarantee social and economic equality			1
he introduced housing , education and economic development initiatives designed to improve the living standards of blacks			0
he also made his mark on the international stage			0
during his five - year presidency , he received 73 heads of state or government and made 83 state visits outside the country			1
@entity3 worked to broker peace in neighboring @entity4 nations , including @entity69 and the @entity70			1
he was involved in restoring order in @entity72 after its may 1998 elections triggered severe unrest , sending in @entity4 troops who stabilized the situation and created a favorable climate for negotiations			2
@entity3 led the call for sanctions against @entity81 following the 1995 execution of writer and activist @entity84 and a number of other political prisoners			1
and he played a leading role in resolving the impasse between the @entity89 , the @entity90 and @entity91 over securing the surrender of the two men charged in the @entity95 bombing			0
but @entity3 often cut a lonely figure on his travels as his marriage to wife @entity99 foundered			2
he was to find love again , with @entity102 , the widow of former @entity104 president @entity103			0
they married on his 80th birthday in 1998			0
in september of that year , he was awarded at a ceremony in @entity108 the @entity89 @entity109 , becoming the first @entity4 to receive the honor			2
president @entity111 said @entity3 was awarded the medal not only because of his " 10,000 long days " spent in prison but also for his " shining example " as a political leader since his release			1
the last three years of @entity3 's presidency were largely in the role of elder statesman as he gradually handed over the day - to - day governing of the country to his deputy , @entity122 , who succeeded him in 1999			1
in his speech at a farewell banquet , @entity3 again referred to the miracle of @entity4			2
" @entity4 from every sector had reached out across the divisions of the centuries and averted a bloodbath which most observers believed inevitable , so much so that our smooth transition was hailed widely as a miracle , " he said			0
" our people have therefore confounded the prophets of doom			0
we are confident they will do it over and over again			0
