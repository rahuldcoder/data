the massive march was the latest in a series of " cacerolazos , " protests named for the cooking pots participants hit to draw attention to problems they say are growing in the @entity16 nation , including crime rates , inflation and political corruption			1

" the people got tired , they really got tired of the government 's lies , " said @entity29 , a 23 - year - old student who joined the protest near @entity0 ' iconic obelisk			1

if you express a different opinion , they pursue you			0

the protests , which started in @entity0 in june , have drawn sharp criticism from supporters of the @entity6 president			1

some decry what they call a right - wing push to defame the president or overthrow the government			1
others say protesters have no clear message			2
@entity6 's government has avoided directly acknowledging the protests			1
but on thursday morning , @entity106 's official @entity105 page noted that her country is a democracy where people are free to express their opinions			2
" so the only thing i ask is that to each @entity6 , and mainly their leaders , let everyone really say what they think and what they want for the country , with sincerity			0
nobody is going to be offended or be bothered , " @entity106 wrote			0

thursday 's protests come about a week after @entity6 lawmakers passed a new measure lowering the nation 's voting age from 18 to 16			1
some critics have said the voting - age change , a year before a key mid-term election in @entity6 , is an attempt by @entity106 's party to garner more votes and increase the odds that lawmakers will change the constitution to allow her re-election bid			1
