-- speaking off the cuff is always a bit of a tightrope act for the occupant of the nation 's highest office , and even more so when it 's in front of a room of reporters			1
president @entity11 teetered on that high wire thursday when he said that he and his advisers " do n't have a strategy yet " for dealing with @entity15 in @entity16			1
the comment , which set off an instant firestorm of commentary , seemed to feed into the narrative cultivated by critics of the president that he has no coherent strategy			1
" @entity11 has given up even ' leading from behind , ' " @entity25 chairman @entity24 tweeted			2
" now , as the world watches , he insists he has no strategy at all			0
" @entity11 's no ' strategy yet ' comment sparks a political uproar here are a few times when other @entity33 politicians found themselves in similar territory : president @entity35 and the ' amazing ' supermarket scanner born into a wealthy family , schooled at an elite @entity41 boarding school and then @entity42 , the nation 's 41st president had more than a couple of strikes against him when it came to an elitist , out - of - touch public image			1
whether the image was true or not , it was driven deeper into the public consciousness after a widely mocked 1992 encounter with a mock - up of a grocery store scanner			2
media accounts of the encounter said the president appeared to be " amazed " and " bewildered " by the technology , which by then had long been in common use			2
" ' if some guy came in and spelled @entity35 differently , could you catch it ? ' the president asked ' yes , ' he was told , and he shook his head in wonder , " wrote @entity58 in the @entity59			1
the mythology has some flaws , @entity35 defenders say			2
according to an @entity73 article published not long after the encounter , the scanner 's manufacturer defended the president , saying the scanner actually was pretty advanced for its day			1
" the whole thing is ludicrous , " the @entity73 quoted the company man as saying			0
" what he was amazed about was the ability of the scanner to take that torn label and reassemble it			2
" president @entity82 and the ' malaise ' speech @entity82 never uttered the word " malaise " in his july 15 , 1979 , televised address on what he saw as a growing " crisis of confidence " in the country			1
but it , perhaps more than any other single word , came to describe @entity82 's presidency			1
here 's what he actually said : " it is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will			2
we can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation			0
" and , he warned , it 's " threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of @entity33			2
" the speech did n't go over well with many who saw @entity82 as an ineffective hand - wringer who had no business possessing the inspirational bully pulpit of the presidency			1
historian @entity121 wrote in his 2008 book , " @entity123 " that @entity82 " appeared to be abdicating his role as leader and blaming the people themselves for their own afflictions			2
" " it was a form of anti-politics unlike any @entity33 had ever seen -- the chief magistrate , who was supposed to inspire the nation and lift it out of its slough of despond , was instead complaining about unrelieved anguish and emptiness , " @entity121 wrote			0
but , like @entity35 's grocery store moment , the narrative had a flip side			1
according to author @entity143 , @entity82 's approval ratings jumped after the speech , and mail poured into the @entity146 from citizens who wrote they were moved to action by the speech and what they saw as refreshing honesty from a politician			1
president @entity153 and the ' bomb ' joke making a voice check before his regular weekend radio speech at the height of the @entity159 in august 1984 , @entity153 joked , " my fellow @entity33 , i am pleased to tell you i just signed legislation which outlaws @entity162 forever			1
the bombing begins in five minutes			0
" while it was just a joke made by a man well - known for his love of quips and never meant for public consumption , the comment embodied beliefs among critics of @entity153 as a dangerous hawk obsessed with doing battle against an " @entity173 , " his finger eagerly hovering over the trigger of @entity33 's nuclear arsenal			1
@entity178 and the internet ask anyone about @entity178 these days , and you 're likely to hear about one of two things : his concern about climate change and how he purportedly claimed in 1999 to have invented the @entity179			0
while @entity178 was only vice president at the time , he was thinking about running for the president 's job , and the statement helped saddle him with an image as pompous and self - aggrandizing			1
like @entity82 and the " malaise " speech , @entity178 never used the word , " invented			1
" this is what he actually said , during an interview on @entity0 : " during my service in the @entity198 , i took the initiative in creating the @entity179			0
" many techies took @entity178 's side , saying that while neither he nor any other single person created the @entity179 , he was , in fact instrumental in helping build out internet infrastructure			0
but tech nerds were no match for the power of late - night television jokesters or , ironically , the power of the budding @entity179			0
to wit , even today , you can still find the claim all over the @entity179			0
@entity213 and the ( cold ) death penalty response it happened on october 13 , 1988 , during a presidential debate between @entity213 and then - vice president @entity35			1
the mediator , @entity0 anchorman @entity217 , asked @entity213 that if his wife were raped and murdered , if he thought he 'd support the death penalty for the killer			0
" no , i do n't , @entity217 , and i think you know that i 've opposed the death penalty during all of my life			0
i do n't see any evidence that it 's a deterrent , and i think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime , " he said coolly			2
in the debate 's press room , reporters instantly declared @entity213 ' campaign dead , @entity231 wrote in a 2007 @entity233 piece			0
" he 's through , " they said , according to @entity231			0
" that 's all she wrote			0
" " get the hook ! " even @entity213 ' campaign manager knew it was over , @entity231 wrote : " when he answered by talking policy , i knew we had lost the election , " @entity231 quoted @entity243 as saying later			0
@entity0 research librarian @entity244 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity11 is n't alone in making comments that feed critics ' narratives
it happened to president @entity35 at a supermarket scanner in 1992
*fallout* from president @entity82 's " malaise " speech helped define his time in office
and what about president @entity153 joking about bombing @entity162 ?
