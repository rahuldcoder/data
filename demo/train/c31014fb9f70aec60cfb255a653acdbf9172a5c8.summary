-- as the forklift trucks packed up the motorhomes and emptied the garages at @entity5 in @entity6 , it did not take very long for the inevitable question to be asked - just how good a driver is @entity9 ? sunday 's race confirmed @entity9 as just the ninth driver in the sport 's 62 - year history to win three world titles , joining greats @entity15 and @entity17 as the only racers to triumph in three consecutive seasons			1
however , what is telling -- given @entity9 is still only 25 -- was the somewhat circumspect response from three world champions and former @entity25 race - winner @entity23 when asked to assess the @entity28 driver 's talents and his place in history			1
" it does n't really change how many races you have already won , getting close to the championship is a big pressure , " said @entity17 , the man @entity9 describes as his childhood hero			1
" even if he appears to have a car that makes it possible for him , nevertheless he has to do it			0
he 's going for it 200 % and it 's a very tough job			0
" he managed to pull it out and that is the extra effort that comes from him and to do this so consistently is very special			0
" rearguard action this season @entity9 had to hold his nerve much more than during his previous championship campaigns			2
in 2010 , he had nothing to lose as he hunted down @entity50 , who had a 15 - point advantage , going into @entity53 's finale			2
the following year he wrapped up a dominant season with four races to spare and finished 122 points clear of his nearest rival @entity58			0
this season , @entity9 overcame a topsy - turvy start in which there were seven different winners in as many races			1
twice his race unravelled with reliability issues and twice -- in @entity53 and @entity6 -- he had to hustle through the field from the back of the grid			1
the @entity69 only took the championship lead with four races to go and then had to fight a fierce rearguard action against @entity50			0
" the interesting part is that this championship has been so hard - fought and it did n't really come together until the last races , " said 1978 champion @entity72			0
" this season has been one of the best in memory			0
@entity9 is one of the rare talents that does n't come along very often			2
" design genius talking of rare talents , the 2012 season demonstrated that if you want to get ahead in @entity85 make sure you have a good engineer in your team			2
no wonder @entity50 pointedly half - joked that he was not only fighting @entity9 -- he was also fighting @entity28 car design guru @entity89			1
when asked if he agreed with @entity50 , @entity89 's face broke into a slow , broad smile before he responded : " no. what can i say ? " crucially when @entity28 lost some ground at the start of 2012 because of a ban on exhaust - blown diffusers , @entity89 found a way to recover the car 's performance and get @entity9 to the front of the pack			1
there is no doubt that over the last three years @entity9 has had the benefit of a supreme machine capable of squeezing out consistent pace and cornering speeds on a variety of circuits			2
" everyone that [ wins the championship ] has n't done it alone , " added @entity72 , who dominated his championship - winning season thanks to the legendary @entity113 ground effect car			0
" you can have the best driver in the world but you need the car			2
when @entity17 and @entity15 were winning they had superior equipment as well			0
@entity9 is making the most of the best design in @entity85			1
that 's what it takes			0
" @entity128 car three - time champion @entity129 certainly believes that when you 're racing in a field thick with five other world champions having the best car is a useful weapon			1
" @entity9 is the top guy , [ @entity136 ] @entity135 is the top guy , @entity50 is the top guy , @entity17 is a top guy too , " @entity129 , who was champion in 1975 , 1977 and 1984 , told @entity0			2
" you need a car , and you need a driver			0
@entity9 is for sure as good as @entity50 is - but you need a better car			1
" what is open to debate is whether @entity28 's peerless car obscures @entity9 's abilities behind the wheel or it hides his limitations			1
some of @entity9 's @entity85 rivals are said to be of the opinion that he does not deserve all the accolades he receives given the car he drives			1
@entity89 's response to that is : " i certainly do n't underrate him -- if other people do that 's their problem			0
" and former @entity155 winner @entity23 argued : " @entity9 is a bright guy			1
whatever the team provide him with he can capitalize upon			0
" he understands what the car is designed to do and he can affect what it does on the circuit			0
for those reasons he is remarkable			0
" and anyway , @entity23 went on , @entity9 is not the only three - time champion to benefit from superior equipment			1
" @entity17 had five consecutive titles but that was in a period when @entity168 had influence on tyre development , " explained @entity23			1
" essentially telling the tyre company ' we want you to make tyres to suit our car and we do n't give a sod about anybody else			0
' " @entity85 's dark periods if @entity9 's achievements over the last three seasons have aligned him with @entity15 and @entity17 as the sport 's only ' three - peat ' champions , is it possible to judge these champions and their abilities side - by - side ? " you can not compare 30 years back , " reflected @entity129 , who survived a near - fatal fiery crash at @entity69 's @entity189 in 1976 before going on to win two more titles			1
" these are different times and different people			0
" the danger involved is the opposite of today			0
[ in the past ] every year at least one got killed so you could work out when it was your turn			0
" to drive on the limit and win races is the same challenge , but today @entity85 is much safer			2
" @entity23 agreed : " @entity15 is my hero			2
why i respect him is that he won five world championships in an era when motor racing was fundamentally a slaughter			2
" when @entity17 won his first world title with @entity210 in 1994 it was also one of @entity85 's darkest periods			1
the @entity69 won the @entity212 in 1994 where both @entity214 racer @entity213 and three - time world champion @entity215 lost their lives			1
it remains as the last race where @entity85 drivers were killed			2
safety improvements over the last 20 years means today 's @entity85 drivers no longer roll the dice against their own mortality as frequently as the brave champions of the past			1
but @entity23 argues there is still an important lesson to be learned from @entity15 , who raced to five championships in the 1950s			0
the @entity230 won four of those titles with different teams -- @entity233 , @entity168 , @entity234 and @entity235			0
his feat has yet to matched			0
" my definition of greatness is not winning three consecutive times but it is winning in different teams , " said @entity23			1
" that is the judgement of a truly great driver			0
" to move from team to team , to be able to build that team around you , to bring leadership and ability as @entity15 did , that is why he is just the greatest all - time @entity85 driver			1
" as @entity250 reeled off the names of other three - time world champions on @entity9 's slow - down lap in @entity254 , @entity9 revealed the @entity28 team boss had forgotten to mention @entity256			1
the @entity257 stands alone in the record books as the sport 's only four - time champion			0
@entity9 aims to join him next year -- then five - time winner @entity15 and @entity17 's magnificent seven are all that are ahead of him in his quest for total greatness .			1

@entity9 won his third consecutive @entity85 title on sunday at @entity5 in @entity6
the 25 - year - old becomes only third man to achieve the feat
@entity28 driver now sits *alongside* legend @entity215 on three title victories
three world champions and former @entity25 race - winner @entity23 assess @entity9 's greatness
