@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 had pretty much given up making her own decisions and so decided to throw open her life to the whims of @entity1 's hundreds of millions of internet users , known in @entity1 as netizens			1
@entity0 resident @entity3 decided to put her life up for sale after an unhappy 2008			1
" it 's your right to arrange @entity3 's life , and it 's my obligation to serve you , " read her online shop			1
since december , @entity3 has been allowing others to decide what she will do each day , because , for the most part , last year was awful , she said			1
her hometown was hit by blizzards , her country rocked by a devastating earthquake , friends divorced and her clothing shop went bankrupt			0
" every time i had a plan for what i wanted my life to be like , nothing would come of it			2
i figured if other people came up with things for me to do , i might stumble upon something new and better , " she told @entity2			2
what she stumbled upon was not only a new life but a new way to make a living			2
she charges about $ 3 an hour , and she 's been asked to do almost everything from delivering pet food to caring for stray cats to taking a hot lunch to a homeless man			1
what surprised her the most was not so much the varied requests but being able to find happiness in the process			0
" if somebody asks you to do something , something simple , and you do it , it can make you very happy			0
you can change from a gloomy person to a very bright one			0
it can help give you a new sense of self - esteem , " she said			2
so far , the most meaningful assignment she was given was attending a child 's birth -- the father was a complete stranger who just wanted someone to take pictures and share the moment			0
there are limits to what she will agree to do			0
she will not do anything illegal , immoral or violent , but she said that has not stopped some from asking			1
" when i first started there was this man who would send me these really disgusting text messages			0
his words were over the top ... nauseating , " she said			0
there was also a man who wanted to meet her for a few private hours at a ski chalet			0
when she turned up with a friend to take photographs , he backed out and then demanded a refund , but @entity3 refused			1
in many ways she is just a glorified errand girl , but with a unique @entity1 twist			0
@entity3 is another example here of how in @entity1 the @entity91 is crossing over from cyberspace to the real world			1
@entity3 does not know how much longer she will keep taking cyberrequests			1
for now it is a good way to survive the financial crisis when many others are losing their jobs and businesses are going broke			0
" when people stop needing me , i 'll go back to my original life			1
but i do n't know what will come , " she said			2
@entity1 's netizens will most likely make that decision for her as well .			2
