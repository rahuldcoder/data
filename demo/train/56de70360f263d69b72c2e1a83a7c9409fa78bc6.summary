@entity0 , @entity1 -- about 20 years ago , 9 - year - old @entity3 fired a rifle out of a window of his home in upstate @entity1 and hit his 7 - year - old neighbor , who was riding on a snowmobile , and killed her			1
the prosecutor decided to try the 9 - year - old as an adult			1
when the charge is murder , @entity1 is one of a handful of states that has no lower age limit for trying children as adults			2
the district attorney argued that @entity3 had lied when asked about the shooting -- and lying is something that adults do			2
the trial judge subsequently agreed to keep @entity3 's case in adult court			1
the boy had seemed normal , the judge said , so there was nothing for the juvenile justice system to treat			2
@entity3 had also dozed during pretrial motions , which showed " a lack of remorse			0
" @entity3 stayed home on bail -- which is available to " adults " -- while his case was argued in appellate courts			2
he eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was placed on probation			2
he received no treatment and had no further involvement with the justice system			1
jump ahead 20 years , to the western @entity1 prosecution of @entity47 , who was 11 when he was charged as an adult with shooting to death his father 's pregnant fianc√©e			1
@entity47 's attorneys have asked the trial judge to remand his case to juvenile court			1
the judge has taken the motion under advisement			0
it should be an easy decision			0
there are common - sense reasons to keep @entity47 in the juvenile system			1
ask any parents of an 11 - year - old if they think their child is really just a small adult ! if @entity47 is adjudicated delinquent , the juvenile justice system can keep him until his 21st birthday			1
that is an extraordinary amount of time for an 11 - year - old			1
it is certainly long enough to serve the needs of public protection , and enough time to rehabilitate a child			0
indeed , studies routinely show that in these cases , the juvenile justice system protects the public better than the criminal justice system			2
if common sense is n't enough , examine the recent science on adolescent development			0
in the early part of the decade , researchers for the @entity87 on @entity88 and @entity89 found that teenagers are less blameworthy than adults , and that their capacities change significantly over the course of adolescence			2
the researchers found what many of us were trying to say years earlier about @entity3 : that at the age of 9 , he simply could n't process information and plan a crime like an adult			1
the @entity87 recognized that legal sanctions for misbehavior should not be based only on the harm a youth causes , but on the youth 's culpability			0
every day , different defendants receive different sentences even if they caused the same harm			0
this is because defendants differ in culpability , or blameworthiness			0
at no other time are these differences more pronounced than during adolescence , when youths struggle with their immaturity , undeveloped decision - making abilities , impulsiveness , lack of future orientation and susceptibility to negative peer pressure			0
recent brain imaging technology reinforces the adolescent development literature			0
from the prefrontal cortex to the limbic area , the teenage brain is undergoing dramatic changes during adolescence in ways that affect teens ' ability to reason , to weigh consequences for their decisions and to delay gratification long enough to make careful short - and long - term choices			0
in their 2008 book " @entity150 , " @entity143 researchers dr. @entity144 and @entity145 concluded that young people under age 15 should never be tried as adults			0
@entity144 and @entity151 make clear that mitigation because of youth -- the fact that teens are less blameworthy than adults -- is not the same as an excuse			0
that is , trying youths in juvenile court is not the same as absolving them of responsibility			1
ten years under juvenile court supervision , for an 11 - year - old , is a very long time			1
the point is that while youths should be punished for their crimes , it should be done in a developmentally appropriate way			0
any parent would know that it makes little sense to punish a 10 - year - old the same as a 17 - year - old			1
another finding of the @entity174 was that young adolescents are not competent enough to be defendants			0
young teens lack the skills to consult with their lawyers and shape trial strategy			0
think of @entity3 , who could n't even stay awake for his pretrial motions			0
imagine @entity47 , now all of 12 years old , advising his lawyer on approaches to cross-examining witnesses , or discussing the pros and cons of pleading guilty			2
it is in society 's enlightened self - interest to keep young teens in the juvenile justice system , where public safety concerns can be addressed and young offenders can be held accountable and be rehabilitated			1
an 11 - year - old is not an adult and should never be treated like one			1
the opinions in the commentary are solely those of @entity200			2
the @entity201 , which he heads , filed a friend of the court brief in @entity3 's case in 1989 and is not involved in the @entity47 case .			1

@entity200 tells of 9 - year - old tried as adult ; he was put on probation , received no treatment
@entity200 : @entity47 should not be tried as an adult for crime committed at 11
*writes* : kids *incompetent* to be tried as adults ; trying them as juveniles not excusing crime
it 's in society 's enlightened self - interest , @entity200 says , to try youngsters in juvenile court
