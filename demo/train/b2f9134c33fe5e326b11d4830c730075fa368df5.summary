-- are we alone in the universe ? findings by @entity5 's kepler space telescope are making that seem less likely			1
@entity5 scientists have announced @entity8 has spotted five planets about the size of @entity11 , orbiting stars in our galaxy			1
these planets are orbiting in what is known as the habitable zone , which puts them at a distance from their suns where liquid water could exist			2
liquid water is a key ingredient for life to form			1
" in a generation we have gone from extraterrestrial planets being a mainstay of science fiction , to the present , where @entity8 has helped turn science fiction into today 's reality , " said @entity5 administrator @entity25			2
the @entity8 science team also announced the telescope found six planets , all larger than @entity11 , orbiting a single sun - like star			2
that star is some 2,000 light years from @entity11			0
to date , the telescope has detected more than 1,200 planet candidates			0
the fact that so many planets have been found in the @entity51 galaxy " suggests there are countless planets orbiting sun - like stars in our galaxy , " said @entity41 , @entity8 's principal investigator			0
@entity8 does not actually see the planets themselves			0
the telescope sees tiny decreases in light from the stars as planets transit across their suns			0
the five @entity11 - sized planets are orbiting stars cooler and smaller than our sun , and further analysis is still necessary to officially confirm they are planets .			1
