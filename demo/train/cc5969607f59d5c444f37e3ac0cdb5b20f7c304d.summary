-- a @entity3 exterminator whose dead daughter and injured son were found in his truck has been charged with attempted murder , and police were searching his @entity10 home thursday night , police said			1
@entity11 , spokesman for @entity12 , told @entity0 that officers were executing a search warrant for evidence in the home of @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity18 , 53 , was found unconscious beside his pest - control truck early monday along a south @entity3 interstate by a road assistance ranger , along with his 10 - year - old adopted son , who was inside the vehicle next to an open gas can , according to a probable - cause affidavit filed by detectives			1
hours later , crews removing toxic chemicals from the truck discovered the boy 's twin sister dead in a plastic bag			2
earlier thursday , @entity18 was taken to a hospital thursday after he " attempted to harm himself , " police said			1
@entity18 , who was in custody in the @entity40 , suffered a self - inflicted injury after deputies told him to get ready to go to a court hearing thursday morning , @entity38 spokesman @entity37 said			1
" he immediately attempted to harm himself by thrusting himself backwards , causing an injury to his head , " @entity37 said			1
" he was immediately checked by emergency personnel and it was decided he was ok to appear in court			0
" however , @entity18 " refused to cooperate " by not speaking and the judge decided to delay the hearing until another date , @entity37 said			1
authorities later decided to take @entity18 to @entity54 for observation , he said			1
meanwhile , a medical examiner has determined a cause of death for the girl , but it will not be made public until investigators review the findings , @entity37 said thursday			1
authorities likely will decide whether and how to charge @entity18 in her death based on the autopsy results , @entity38 capt. @entity62 said wednesday			1
the children were among the four the @entity67 adopted from @entity3 's foster care system			2
when the boy was found monday by the roadside assistance ranger , he " appeared to be in respiratory distress and ( was ) trembling " and his clothing " was soaked with an unknown chemical , " the probable - cause affidavit said			0
the ranger then found @entity18 on the ground beside the truck and called for help			1
the boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen , upper thighs and buttocks , the affidavit said			0
while examining the boy , doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries , including a broken collarbone , a broken arm , scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen , and ligature marks on both wrists , police said			2
after @entity18 and his son were taken to a hospital , a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl , wrapped in a plastic bag , the document said			1
@entity18 told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter , and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire , the affidavit said			1
@entity18 said he did n't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him , the document added			2
" basically , to paraphrase , he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death , " @entity37 told reporters wednesday			2
" he drove here from @entity3 accompanied by his son			0
" he then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self , intending to light himself on fire			0
his son 's head was in his lap and he decided , after giving his son some sleeping pills , that he was n't going to do that			2
" @entity18 told police that in dousing himself with gasoline , he inadvertently got some on the boy , @entity62 said wednesday			1
but his story does n't add up , because there was no gasoline on the boy , she said			0
instead , he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined			0
" that 's why we 're still treating this as a hazmat ( hazardous materials case ) , " @entity62 said			0
the truck in which the children were found was taken to a secure location , @entity37 said , where an @entity148 evidence recovery team is going through the vehicle			0
authorities are waiting for test results on the chemicals found in the truck			0
@entity37 said the substance on the boy 's body and clothes was so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well			0
the boy , who was transferred wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at @entity10 's @entity161 , has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube , @entity62 explained			2
asked whether @entity18 has expressed remorse , she said , " he feels remorse , but we 're not getting consistent statements with what we 're seeing in our evidence			2
" " it 's a complex case , " she added			0
at a hearing wednesday in @entity10 attended by @entity18 's wife , @entity173 , a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care			1
@entity3 's @entity178 had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the @entity18 family , and it was n't the first such complaint , spokesman @entity177 said			1
reporters in the courtroom wednesday heard tales of abuse , mainly concerning the twins , from state officials and experts			0
the caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape , the court heard			0
the story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home , officials said in court			0
an investigator told the court that she went to the family 's home on february 11 but had not seen the children			2
instead , she said , she left after speaking with @entity18 , planning to return on monday			1
asked why she did not return sooner , she said , " i 'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend			0
" however , a spokesman for the department , @entity210 , said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent			0
@entity0 's @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
