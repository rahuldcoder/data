-- mention the @entity2 city of @entity3 , and people think of history , conjuring images of a classical city that was once @entity9 's @entity8 capital			1
in truth , the structure of the city has changed little since the 15th century when @entity13 , @entity14 and the other great painters and sculptors of the era paraded through its piazzas			2
but what 's it like to explore these ancient streets using the tools of the 21st century ? is it possible to survive in @entity3 and see it properly armed with just a smartphone ? this was the challenge i set myself when visiting the city			1
nothing written down at all , and definitely no help from a friendly local			2
getting there traveling to @entity3 using technology is easy			1
new high - speed rail company @entity37 has an app and e-booking service			2
all i need is my phone and booking code to take my seat for the 180 mph ( 290 kph ) journey from @entity45			2
accommodation is a breeze , too			1
@entity3 is one of more than a dozen @entity2 cities covered by last - minute room booking app @entity50			1
the app suggests a couple of places in the humdrum neighborhood near the city 's station , but also a riverside artisan workshop turned boutique hotel , @entity60 ( @entity61 98 , @entity3 ; +39 055 7130272 )			1
a couple of swipes later the room is mine , for $ 210			2
when i get there , all rooms in the cheapest category are gone			2
i get an upgrade to a two - floor suite , with kitchen , bathroom and a floating staircase up to a loft room beneath the original workshop ceiling			0
so far , so good			0
a quick check of another hotel reservation app suggests i 've saved nearly $ 70 on my booking			1
' upside - down palace ' like all big @entity9 cities , @entity3 has its share of apps that translate the tried - and - tested format of a paper guidebook onto a screen			1
among the best is too much @entity3 , available free for both @entity88 and @entity89 phones			1
i appreciate the app 's eye for the offbeat			0
it leads me to @entity94 , a sad little square close to the @entity97 church			0
the square earned its name during the medieval period , when children who died unbaptized were buried here			0
the same app also takes me to the extravagant " upside - down palace " of @entity103			0
the @entity104 was supposedly decorated with an inverted facade during the 16th century , to thwart the building regulations of a @entity108 duke			0
@entity109 is n't supposed to be a travel app , but it 's exactly the tool you need to find a decent pint anywhere in the world , even here in the heart of wine country			1
it points me to @entity119 ( @entity120 34r , @entity3 ; +39 055 2476763 ) , a modern bar with neon , foosball , snacks and 10 pumps of artisan beers , including their own brews made in the neighboring city of @entity129			1
thanks to my four - inch screen , i 'm enriched , fed and watered			0
sightseeing seems easier than ever			0
in fact , tech - friendly travel logistics get ever easier , even in the heart of " old @entity9			2
" when i 'm due to meet my family for an onward trip to @entity138 , a quick search on @entity142 's @entity141 app tells me their train is running 10 minutes late			1
i do n't need to rush in vain			0
the app even seemed to know their platform before the arrivals board did			0
( it was wrong , however			0
) no spare change for @entity3 's new tram ? no problem : a text message to 488 - 0105 and an sms comes right back to me , the fare deducted from my prepaid phone account			1
when on roam it 's not all plain surfing			0
mobile phone battery technology has n't kept speed with the power - hungry hd screens and super-quick quad - core processors inside modern smartphones			0
on both mornings i set out with a fully charged battery			0
on neither day did my phone last beyond 3 p.m. the situation with data is perhaps even worse			2
in 36 hours , i consumed more than 180 megabytes			0
seeing @entity3 from the small screen would have been prohibitively expensive if i was being billed by the megabyte			1
roaming charges for travelers originating within the @entity174 will likely be phased out by late 2015 , but that offers no comfort to many visitors , especially with arrivals from @entity179 and the rest of @entity181 growing rapidly			1
ubiquitous free @entity182 would help			0
in april , @entity184 's @entity183 announced it was rolling out free @entity182 to all passengers , but for truly wireless travel , connectivity needs to go beyond the gates of the airport parking lot			2
of course , none of that is @entity3 's fault			1
behind its medieval walls and ancient traditions , the city is getting ready for a new generation of visitors -- and their gadgets , too			0
@entity199 is a food and travel journalist and co-author of " @entity203 to @entity184 , @entity3 and @entity204 2014			1

is it possible to visit @entity3 , @entity2 , and see it properly with just a smartphone ?
travel and accommodation bookings are easy thanks to train and hotel apps
*relying* on phones instead of guidebooks can be *costly* due to data roaming charges
