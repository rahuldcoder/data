-- @entity0 's new documentary , " @entity3 , " tugs open the curtain for a moment on one of the most complex , haunted presidents in modern times			0
i worked on his @entity11 staff for more than three years and can attest that that while this is n't the complete @entity15 , viewers get a revealing , first - hand look at parts of the man rarely seen			1
it is hard for younger generations to grasp just how dominant a figure @entity15 was for over four decades in @entity24 life			1
with the exception of @entity26 -- the @entity27 of 20th century politics -- only @entity15 has been nominated by his party for high office in five national elections			1
from the days he rocketed to power as a young , ambitious congressman until he went to his grave , @entity15 made the cover of @entity36 56 times			1
no one else in his time was as widely respected or reviled ; no one else won a massive re-election only to leave the @entity11 in disgrace			0
@entity15 almost had it all -- and then he lost it			2
why ? why do colossally powerful men make a colossal hash of things , even down to today ? i was a relative innocent when i left the @entity49 in the early 1970s and by serendipity , was offered a job in the @entity52 by @entity53 , then the head of the speechwriting team and soon a wonderful mentor			0
@entity57 asked me to be his administrative assistant and within weeks , i was a note taker in cabinet meetings , where i had a bird 's - eye view of @entity15 at his best			1
the @entity0 documentary captures some of those heady moments through the home movie cameras of @entity65 ( chief of staff ) , @entity67 ( top domestic adviser ) and @entity68 ( @entity71 's aide - de - camp and television impresario )			0
the films show how much @entity15 doted on the pomp and circumstance of the office -- the balloon drops at conventions , waving to mammoth crowds ( 7 million turned out when we went to @entity80 ) , walking the @entity81 in @entity82 , sipping champagne with @entity84			2
@entity15 lapped it all up			2
photos : @entity15 through the years what is missing from the films are the serious , thoughtful conversations of @entity15 away from cameras			2
in truth , he was the best strategist i have seen in the presidency -- someone able to go up on a mountain top , look 30 years into the future and try to bend the arc of history to favor the nation 's security interests			0
he was a student of the past and like one of his heroes , @entity102 , thought that a leader who can see farther back can see farther ahead			0
@entity24 knew he could be mean and duplicitous , but i sensed they voted for him because they also thought he was smart enough and tough enough to keep the @entity106 at bay			0
if your home is threatened , you want a @entity111 shepherd , not a cocker spaniel			0
in my early days as a junior lieutenant , i mostly saw the bright side of @entity15 -- the one who read books recommended to him by his early counselor , @entity117 , and debated the virtues of @entity120 generals with @entity121			1
only when i had more experience and he invited me in closer did he begin to reveal the rest of him -- the dark side			1
that darker side is woven through the @entity0 documentary , mostly through the secret tapings that he made of himself and those with whom he was talking			0
only a select few knew of the taping system ; learning of it was a shock to all the rest of us on staff			0
i had not heard most of the tapes here but found them consistent with the @entity15 i eventually came to know : a brooding , deeply insecure man who laments how little support he has from his own @entity142 and how much bias he sees in the press			2
it has been said that even paranoids have real enemies			0
indeed , @entity15 had plenty of real enemies , but his insecurities prompted him to create even more in the way he lashed back			1
he came to believe that politics is a jungle and that to survive , one must observe the law of the jungle : either eat or be eaten			0
@entity155 : four lessons from @entity15 's presidency the late @entity158 -- along with @entity53 , one of the white hats in that @entity11 -- thought @entity160 could be traced back to the @entity161			1
@entity15 came to power not only with insecurities but with a bitterly divisive war on his hands , one that threatened to tear the country apart			2
as was his wont , @entity15 thought he had to control events , not be controlled by them			1
so , he started bugging the phones of reporters and his own appointees and eventually he set up a " plumbers " unit to stop national security leaks			0
in view of @entity176 , who served as a close legal adviser to @entity15 , that effort to control anti-war fever turned into a political operation during the 1972 re-election			1
from there , it was only a tiny step to the @entity160 break - in at @entity188 headquarters			0
that is a persuasive theory , but i concluded there was something more basic also at work in @entity15 's downfall -- and we see pieces of it in the @entity0 documentary			1
fundamentally , i believe that as @entity202 argued , each of us has a bright and dark side , and that the task of becoming a mature , integrated adult is to conquer one 's dark side or at least bring it under control			1
@entity15 simply did not have that dark side under control -- he had demons inside him and when they rose up in fury , as they did so often , they could not only destroy others but destroy him , too			1
there have been moments since his downfall that i have actually felt sorry for him			0
as a wise counselor of his , @entity220 , once observed , we will never know what happened to @entity15 when he was young , but it must have been something terrible			1
a word about the three men behind the cameras in the documentary : i knew each of them in varying degrees and am sure they never envisioned themselves as @entity15 " henchmen			2
" as their films suggest , they thought they had a ringside seat on one of the greatest shows ever -- and loved it			0
but they were swept into the web of intrigue in that @entity11 and went along with the deceits , the dirty tricks and yes , the criminality			0
@entity67 eventually felt bitter and betrayed by @entity15 ; @entity65 , as the film represents , felt the critics were terribly wrong and that one day , @entity15 would be better understood			1
emotionally , i was drawn more to @entity68 : he was young and relatively innocent , too , and he was one of the most creative advisers i have seen in the @entity11 -- an impresario in the league of @entity246 and @entity247			0
his " sin , " i believe , is that he was so devoted that he would do anything to protect @entity15			2
he paid with a broken career -- the price reckless leaders often exact from the young			0
forty years later , @entity68 -- to his credit -- is still trying to protect what he can of @entity15 , telling me and others where he thinks the @entity0 documentary film is wrong ( too one - sided , he thinks , and misleading in various ways )			1
to this day , historians as well as those of us who lived through the @entity15 period , disagree in our judgments			2
i will always believe that @entity15 had elements of greatness in him , but he was ultimately the architect of his own downfall -- he could not control that dark , inner fury and , for the good of the country , he had to go			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity273 .			2

@entity273 worked in the @entity15 administration as a young staffer
he recalls being impressed by @entity15 's thinking but got *glimpses* of his dark side
@entity15 had enemies but also dealt with inner demons he could n't control , @entity273 says
@entity273 : new film gives viewers a side of @entity15 rarely seen
