formed in 1945 , @entity19 had seen a " a slow but constant increase " of supporters in recent years , said the website of an umbrella group , @entity48			2

" we should avoid being alarmist , " @entity70 said			0
@entity43 interior minister @entity79 said the incident is similar to a wave of letter bombs sent last month by an anarchist group based in @entity42 and claimed the bombs came from there			1
but @entity42 officials disputed the notion that anyone in their country was involved in the blasts			1
" there is no evidence that the bombs originated in @entity42 , " @entity64 spokesman @entity91 said			1
in addition to the @entity23 and @entity24 blasts , a " suspicious package " was found at the @entity97 in the @entity43 capital , police said , but it turned out not to be dangerous			1
there were also false alarms at the @entity104 and @entity105 embassies			0
police began their sweeps of all embassies and consulates after the blasts , the @entity43 ministers said			1

in november , police discovered 14 parcel bombs emanating from @entity42 , most of which were sent to various embassies in @entity37			1

other parcel bombs were addressed to @entity141 targets including the leaders of @entity143 and @entity43			2

@entity153 , 22 , and @entity154 , 24 , were also in possession of a delivery slip for another parcel containing an explosive device that had been delivered to a courier service and was addressed to the @entity160 , police said			0
@entity162 spokesman maj. @entity161 called the two suspects " important members of a terrorist group			0
" before the attacks , @entity153 already faced an arrest warrant alleging his membership in an illegal organization called the @entity170			0
@entity42 authorities stressed that they believed the wave of letter bombs in november was the work of a home - grown @entity42 terrorist group that does not have ties to international organizations like @entity179			1
