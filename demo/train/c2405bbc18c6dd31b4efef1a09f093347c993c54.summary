conservative @entity0 are painting @entity2 immigrants as @entity4 carriers to fan the anti-immigration reform movement , but health experts say those fears are grossly overstated			1
officials say there have been no reported cases of @entity4 - infected migrants entering the @entity13 through @entity14 and border authorities reject claims that the border is not secure			1
still many politicians continue to raise the alarm , seeking to derail immigration reform -- already delayed several times by @entity22 and the president			0
on thursday , former @entity25 senator and now @entity28 @entity27 candidate @entity24 said that he does n't want undocumented immigrants crossing the @entity13 - @entity14 border because they might be carrying @entity4			1
" one of the reasons why i 've been so adamant about closing our border , because if people are coming through normal channels -- can you imagine what they can do through our porous borders ? " @entity24 said in a radio interview			2
@entity0 candidate @entity44 , running for a @entity27 seat in @entity43 , said in a debate on tuesday that the @entity13 should seal its border with @entity14 to prevent the spread of @entity4 , while @entity48 , the @entity49 senator and potential presidential candidate in 2016 , said last week that the southern border is not secure enough to keep out @entity4			1
the countries most affected by the virus are @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity57			0
according to @entity58 , director of the @entity60 's program at the @entity61 , the largest communities of @entity62 in @entity60 can be found in @entity63 and the @entity64 -- not @entity65 , where the majority of immigrants who illegally cross the border are from			1
@entity69 , founder of @entity70 , an opinionated latino - issues website , questioned the motivation of such fears			0
" i am starting to think that this is all some kind of mix - and - match game of fear , " he said			0
" you take the most extreme examples of xenophobic hysteria -- @entity14 , terrorists , @entity81 , the border crisis and @entity4 -- and mash them all together to create a new narrative of craziness , " he added			1
the @entity85 of immigration reform has been going on for months			0
in july , @entity88 @entity87 rep. @entity87 , a medical doctor , wrote a letter to dr. @entity90 , director of the @entity91 , expressing his concern that the influx of families and unaccompanied minors at the @entity13 - @entity14 border could pose a grave public health risk			1
" reports of illegal migrants carrying deadly diseases such as swine flu , dengue fever , ebola virus and tuberculosis are particularly concerning , " he wrote			0
unaccompanied migrant children posed a particular risk , he said , because they could spread the disease too quickly to be controlled , once in the @entity13			1
he urged the @entity91 to immediately assess the situation and notify the public of risks			0
during an august hearing of the @entity113 's subcommittee on @entity57 , @entity90 dismissed the possibility of @entity4 reaching the @entity13 via the southern border			1
" that is not happening , " he said			0
other health officials agree with @entity90			2
they call threats , like the one @entity87 describes , as farfetched			0
there has never been an outbreak of @entity4 in @entity60 , said dr. @entity121 , director of the @entity122			2
that makes it extremely unlikely for a child or adult entering the @entity13 via @entity14 to be infected with the disease			1
unswayed by the medical community 's assertions of safety , far - right conservative politicians and their sympathizers have gone even further			0
@entity134 host @entity133 suggested that an ebola infested terrorist could enter through the southern border and wage biological warfare			2
meanwhile , @entity140 @entity139 rep. @entity139 , currently running for @entity27 , said that terror groups are collaborating with drug cartels in @entity14			2
homeland security secretary @entity143 denied these allegations thursday and warned against creating fear and anxiety in the public by passing on speculation and rumor			0
some @entity2 @entity0 have tried to distance themselves from the @entity4 and @entity81 border fears			1
" i am saddened to see some conservatives use fear of deadly diseases to push an immigration restriction agenda			2
their claims are generally vastly overblown and i am especially disappointed in rep. @entity87 , who is a medical doctor and should know better , " said @entity156 , president of @entity157 .			0
