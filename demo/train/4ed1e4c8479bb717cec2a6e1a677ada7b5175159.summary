@entity0 -- in @entity3 , a sex scandal is often more than just a sex scandal -- because it often involves public money			1
so jilted mistresses have stepped forward as graft - busters in @entity3 's crackdown on corruption			1
consider the fate of @entity11			0
the party official lost his job earlier this year after a former mistress revealed he had embezzled $ 200 million from banks			0
" they have become the most effective way in combating corruption , " says social commentator and author @entity16			2
" and when these mistresses become the most effective way , that means the government crackdown has n't been very effective			2
" @entity3 's anti-corruption drive has targeted so - called " tigers and flies " -- the powerful leaders and lowly officials who are defrauding the nation			1
party at stake with the very legitimacy of the @entity35 at stake , the fight against graft has been a main focus of @entity3 president @entity38 , with his anti-corruption tsar @entity39 at his side			1
but how effective has it been ? putting aside the widely publicized fall of @entity44 , which is viewed by many as the result of an internal power struggle , the party has yet to make a significant number of high - level corruption take - downs			1
" @entity38 has only caught one tiger , a very powerful former head of the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) , " says political analyst and scholar @entity50 , referring to @entity52 , the former @entity53 chief , who also held massive control over @entity3 's state - owned firms			1
@entity3 - watchers are keeping a close eye on a far bigger beast -- @entity3 's high - ranking ex-security chief , @entity61			1
" at least half of the vice-ministerial and ministerial levels who @entity38 has brought to justice have close connections to @entity61 , " @entity50 tells me			2
" this is an important litmus test as to whether @entity39 and @entity38 are willing to break certain conventions			2
" because there is one well - known convention within the @entity35 ... former and current officials of the @entity74 are untouchable			0
" no rule of law they are untouchable due to the lack of checks and balances in @entity3			2
" it 's like if a person is ill , he takes his own pulse , prescribes his own medicine , he takes an x-ray on himself and then -- if need be -- he will operate on himself , " says @entity82 ' @entity81 - based correspondent @entity80			0
" that 's not possible , but that 's what is happening in @entity3			0
" @entity3 's political elite is also untouchable thanks to @entity3 's lack of rule of law			0
" there is no rule of law , so people who have good ' guanxi , ' people who have good connections with the co-called ' red aristocracy ' -- or top officials -- can grease the palms of the officials to get things done and jump the queue , " says @entity50			0
without the rule of law or a powerful independent organization against corruption , prospects for reform in @entity3 are dim			1
" there will not be meaningful real reform , " says @entity16			0
" because general reform will require a leader who will have courage and will hurt the interests of his family and friends			0
" " @entity38 has to become strong in order to reform , " adds @entity80			0
" but of course if he becomes strong , he may not reform			0
" easy targets meanwhile , the party fixes its focus on lower , easy - to - reach targets -- going after petty officialdom with an austerity drive targeting luxury spending			1
" at the end of the day , @entity38 's policy of restricting conspicuous consumption , putting an end to banquets and six star hotels , is popular , " says @entity50			1
" nonetheless , regarding big - time corruption that means the passing of the envelope and greasing the palm through a billion - yuan kickback -- all of this continues to go on			0
" @entity3 's war on corruption is merely the swatting of flies .			1

jilted mistresses have become **key** *weapon* in exposing graft
fighting corruption a **key** policy of @entity3 president @entity38
campaign has not been effective , with few high - *profile* targets
party fixes its focus on petty officialdom , banning *lavish* banquets and gifts
