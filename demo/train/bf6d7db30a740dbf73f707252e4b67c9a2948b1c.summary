traveling these routes inspires wonder and awe in those willing to shrug off the discomforts and heart - in - mouth moments that they entail			1
whether you 're gazing through a dirt - smudged window on a clapped - out bus , its engine revving desperately to clear a narrow pass , or grinding through an endless expanse of sand in a @entity15 , these roads have gained a reputation for being among the most brutal in the world			1
if you long for white - knuckle adventure , sometimes it really is more about the journey than the destination			1
@entity22 : top sights of the @entity25 world @entity26 , @entity27 crossing the historic @entity26 through @entity27 's rugged red sand wilderness is a modern - day explorer 's dream			1
one of the world 's most remote tracks , the dust - tinged , take - no - prisoners toughness of this 1,820 kilometer old drover 's trail is tempered by the opportunity to meet the traditional owners of this isolated land			1
the @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 of the @entity43 still live along , and are the custodians of , the route			1
the chance to interact with these @entity43 communities and visit rock - art sites that date back tens of thousands of years is an enriching glimpse into the fascinating culture of this region			1
where : running from @entity53 to @entity54 in @entity27			1
when : the cooler months of may to september			1
headless horseman and other frights how : you can begin at either end and the route takes at least 18 days to complete			1
there are five communities with fuel and supply amenities along the way but for much of the journey it really is simply just you and the sprawl of the @entity69 desert			1
understandably then , navigating the @entity26 independently requires a lot of pre-emptive planning and a permit must be obtained before travel			1
as well as a 4 - wheel - drive vehicle , you 'll need to carry all the necessary equipment , supplies and spare parts in case of breakdowns and emergencies			1
the track is not maintained ( although it is signed clearly ) and there are hundreds of sand dunes to navigate			1
prior desert driving experience and mechanical ability are mandatory for anyone contemplating a journey here			2
an extremely helpful booklet on preparing for and driving the route is available to download on the @entity91 website			2
@entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 a centuries - old trading trail , which once formed part of the famed @entity98 , the @entity92 ( more commonly referred to as the @entity92 ) is the world 's highest altitude paved international road			1
its 1,200 kilometers slice through the mighty @entity103 , passing through remarkable mountain scenery and providing access to top - notch trekking and mountaineering			2
blasted through one of the most challenging landscapes on earth , the @entity92 is a triumphant feat of engineering and a monumental reminder of the more than 1,000 lives lost during its construction			2
a journey here , in the rooftop of the world , is not only a stunning salute to the power of nature but also of man 's constant struggle to contain it			2
where : from @entity126 ( near @entity127 ) in @entity93 to @entity128 in @entity94			1
when : @entity129 ( may to june ) and early autumn ( september to october )			2
parts of the road are closed during winter due to snowfall and sometimes in summer because of landslides caused by the monsoon			2
the @entity137 / @entity136 border post along the @entity92 officially closes between 31 december and 1 may each year but , depending on weather , the annual reopening can be delayed			2
if you 're intending on traveling in early may it 's worthwhile checking beforehand			2
how : public transport between the main towns on the @entity92 is cheap and plentiful and many travelers take two to three weeks to cover the full route , allowing time to stop off and explore			2
wherever you begin your journey , you 'll need to acquire visas for both countries before you set off along the route as they are n't issued on the @entity137 / @entity136 border post that straddles either side of the @entity153			2
road conditions deteriorate on the @entity93 side and the word ' highway ' should be used in its loosest sense			1
however , the entire road is being overhauled ( the @entity94 portion is already finished ) with an extensive program of road works for the @entity93 section being funded by the @entity94			1
eventually this will mean that the road will be open year - round			2
travelers should be aware that rebuilding of the section of the @entity92 that runs through @entity93 's upper @entity169 is still ongoing after the 2010 landslide which created a lake submerging 22 kilometers of road			1
at the moment this portion of the route is navigated by boat			2
@entity22 : vanishing history : the most intriguing lost cities @entity179 , @entity180 well , it 's not nicknamed @entity182 ( @entity179 ) for nothing			1
@entity180 's infamous route from @entity185 down into the rainforest - clad @entity187 region is a dizzying descent of terrifyingly tight turns flanked by sheer cliff on one side and dramatic drop - offs on the other			1
notorious for traffic accidents ( an estimated 200 deaths used to occur on the 69 kilometer route annually ) , the @entity180 government completed a series of road modernizations in 2007 , building an entirely new branch that bypasses much of the original tract			1
despite ( or perhaps , because of ) the road 's infamy , the old route has become a tourist attraction in its own right			0
where : from @entity185 to @entity209 when : due to safety considerations , it 's best to avoid the rainy season from mid-december to early march			0
how : for anyone who wants to experience the heart - in - mouth palpitations of the @entity179 , the best ( and safest ) option is the @entity216 ; a hurtling , adrenalin - junkie ride down twisting bends			0
with the opening of the modernized bypass in 2007 , cyclists no longer have to worry about the extra danger of dodging trucks and buses as they rush headlong down the narrow ridge chiseled out of the mountainside			0
the hundreds of tiny crosses scattered along the route are a sobering reminder of the many lives this road has claimed in its perilous history			0
the road ends at @entity209 , a 1,100 - meter drop in altitude from the high @entity180 altiplano at its start			1
@entity209 is a popular starting point for further adventures in the @entity180 @entity241 and most travelers spend at least a night here before moving on to @entity244			1
@entity245 , @entity246 flanked alternately by vistas of staggering snow - capped mountains and arid high - altitude plains this winding 490 kilometer route is one of @entity246 's most beautiful			0
traffic along the @entity245 ascends and descends through nail - biting mountain passes , fording across streams and glacial melts , which results in some seriously hair - raising moments but also some of the most incredible photographic opportunities the subcontinent can offer			0
where : beginning in @entity245 ( @entity262 ) and ending in @entity263 ( @entity264 )			0
when : only open during the summer , approximately from june to mid-october			0
how : due to snow cover , the highway is only traversable for roughly four months of the year			0
the cheapest way to travel along the route is by bus , with both public and private transport operators running regular transport along the route during this time			0
the main public bus company is @entity274 and seats on their buses should be reserved a couple of days in advance			1
with the highest pass along the route measuring a whopping 5420 meters above sea level , the bus journey is staggered over two days , with an overnight stop usually spent in the town of @entity285 which alleviates your chances of suffering @entity288 ( @entity288 )			0
shared taxis are also plentiful but best avoided : completing the journey in a dizzying long haul of 16 - 18 hours , known as the ' @entity292 ' , is not only tough on your body due to the altitude , but also leaves you no time to contemplate the scenery			0
@entity22 : best ' middle of nowhere ' places @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 the ultimate desert adventure			0
running for a mammoth 4,500 kilometers through three countries , driving the @entity298 is a test of mettle and guts which attracts the brave , the foolhardy and the crazy			0
although plagued by security risks along some sections , the bigger danger is in going head - to - head with one of the world 's most intensely harsh environments			0
adventure - seekers may covet traveling this route for the all - out kudos involved but its real attraction is the opportunity it affords to savor the @entity320 at its most spellbinding			0
where : @entity322 ( @entity299 ) , via @entity300 , to @entity323 ( @entity301 )			0
when : the cooler months of november to february			0
how : this is n't a trip to be undertaken lightly			0
you 'll need a @entity15 , extensive desert driving and mechanical experience , and you must be self - sufficient in supplies and equipment			0
you 'll also have to jump through several bureaucratic hoops in order to get the paperwork and visas necessary for this kind of expedition			0
anyone contemplating a trip here should be aware that travelers with their own vehicle are required by @entity343 law to hire a local escort in @entity299 and that the @entity299 - @entity300 border is often closed to foreigners due to instability in northern @entity300			0
the @entity298 itself is in much better condition these days			0
the road is sealed all the way through @entity299 and @entity301 and most of @entity300 with only one 150 - kilometer stretch from the @entity299 - @entity300 border post to @entity354 in @entity300 being a hard sand surface			0
for the most recent developments and up - to - date advice on driving the @entity298 , travelers should check the @entity360 website			0
