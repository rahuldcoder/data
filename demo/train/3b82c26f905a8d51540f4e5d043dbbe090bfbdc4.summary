-- @entity1 illustrated why he is one of the world 's most controversial soccer players on sunday as he bit an opponent before going on to save his club from defeat with a last - gasp goal			1
the @entity9 star showed his best and worst sides in a controversial 2 - 2 draw with @entity12 , and he potentially faces another long suspension after his assault on @entity15			1
@entity1 , the @entity16 's top scorer , wrestled with the @entity12 defender and then clearly sank his teeth into the @entity20 's arm			1
the incident was not seen by referee @entity22 , who shrugged off @entity15 's angry protestations			2
@entity1 later apologized on his @entity25 account			2
" i 'm sad for what happened this afternoon , i apologize @entity15 and all football world for my inexcusable behavior			0
i 'm so sorry about it ! ! " wrote @entity1			0
among his @entity25 followers is former boxing champion @entity31 , who infamously bit off part of an opponent 's ear in 1997			0
it is not the first time @entity1 has bitten an opponent -- he was suspended for seven matches in late 2010 after an incident while playing for @entity41 club @entity40 , two months before joining @entity9			1
he was also banned for eight matches after racially abusing @entity44 's @entity43 in october 2011 , and former @entity9 captain @entity45 said after the @entity12 match that the 26 - year - old is in " last - chance saloon			1
" @entity45 , one of the match analysts for @entity52 broadcaster @entity50 , said the club needed to take strong action after an incident which reflects badly on one of the world 's most famous teams			0
" people will be talking about this for a long , long time and it 's going to show @entity9 in a very bad light -- especially in this week of all weeks , the anniversary of @entity72 , " said the 59 - year - old , referring to the 24th anniversary of the stadium tragedy where 96 people died after a crush during a match between @entity9 and @entity65			1
" it ca n't happen again			0
i firmly believe this puts him in the last - chance saloon as a @entity9 player -- the board have to see it that way because they 're risking everything this great football club stands for , " added @entity45 , who was a player during @entity9 's glory days of the 1970s and ' 80s and later managed the club			1
@entity9 's current manager @entity86 refused to criticize @entity1 in his postmatch interview with @entity50 , saying he had yet to see the incident and that he would review it later			1
" i 'll make an honest appraisal on it and comment afterwards			0
it 's not for me to make any rash comments or predictions now , " said @entity86 , who claimed @entity12 's former @entity9 striker @entity90 had elbowed his defender @entity91 in the face			1
the @entity96 was booked for that challenge			0
@entity86 later added on @entity9 's website : " having reviewed the video footage and spoken to @entity1 , his behavior is unacceptable and i have made him aware of this			1
" @entity86 ' predecessor @entity102 was widely criticized for publicly defending @entity1 during the @entity43 case , and after the punishment was handed out by the @entity105			0
another former @entity9 player , @entity106 , said that the actions of @entity1 -- who has often been criticized for diving on the pitch -- were " indefensible			1
" " there is that madness - genius gene in him because as a player he 's exceptional , with people talking about him being player of the year , but what he did today , is indefensible , " said @entity106 , also a @entity50 analyst			2
" even the staunchest @entity9 supporters can not look at that and think that 's alright			2
" why on earth would you want to take a chunk out of someone 's arm when you are on a football field ? that is an absolutely incredible act of brutality			2
" @entity9 , owned by the @entity130 @entity129 , insisted it would take internal action against @entity1			2
" his behavior is not befitting of any player wearing a @entity9 shirt and @entity1 is aware that he has let himself and everyone associated with the club down , " said managing director @entity132			2
" we will deal with the matter internally and await any action from the @entity105			0
" the incident overshadowed former @entity9 manager @entity143 's return to @entity144 with @entity12 , but the @entity96 refused to comment on @entity1 -- instead complaining about the near seven minutes of time added on that allowed the striker to head an equalizer for his 23rd @entity16 goal of the season			1
" six minutes and 45 seconds is difficult to explain			0
we need to analyze why we did n't stop the cross and they scored , but in the normal circumstances we would have finished the game , " @entity143 said			0
@entity1 had earlier set up second - half substitute @entity155 to make it 1 - 1 after @entity158 's first - half headed opener , but then inexplicably handled the ball in his own penalty area to allow @entity162 to put @entity12 in front again from the spot			1
the draw dented @entity12 's chances of qualifying for next season 's @entity166 , leaving @entity143 's team in fourth place -- a point behind @entity171 and one ahead of @entity172			2
@entity172 had earlier stunned second - placed @entity173 3 - 1 , a result that means @entity44 can wrap up a record - extending 20th @entity176 title with four matches to spare			1
victory in monday 's home match against relegation - threatened @entity180 will end @entity173 's @entity16 reign , as manager @entity182 ponders what has gone wrong this season			1
" i ca n't believe that we lost this game because we played very , very well for 80 minutes , " the @entity186 manager said after @entity172 came from behind to score three late goals			0
" this is our problem this year , when we have chances we do n't score			0
" @entity191 gave @entity173 the lead in the fifth minute , but @entity193 set up @entity195 's equalizer with 15 minutes to play before substitute @entity196 cut inside visiting captain @entity197 and lashed in a right - foot shot			2
@entity193 , returning after an ankle injury , then wrapped up the win with his 18th league goal this season			0
@entity173 's only hope of silverware this season is the @entity206 , with the final against @entity208 on may 11 as @entity182 seeks to win back the trophy he lifted two seasons ago			1
" we needed to win because we want to get second position and to have a better life for the next week , but we did n't deserve to lose -- we deserved to win , " he said			0
" the championship was finished three or four weeks ago , they deserved to win it			0
i think that it 's important for us to win as many games now as we can			0
