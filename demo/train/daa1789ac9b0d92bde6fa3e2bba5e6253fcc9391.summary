@entity0 convicted rapist needs to " rethink " his strategy as he attempts to resume his professional football career , according to the chief of player welfare in the game in @entity8			1
@entity9 had been on the cusp of a move to @entity12 , which plays in @entity15 football 's third tier , but the club pulled out of the deal because of " unbearable pressure " on its staff			1
linked with a return to former club @entity21 last year , @entity9 remains without a club after being released from prison in october having served half of a five - year sentence for raping a 19 - year - old girl			1
both @entity12 and @entity21 were dissuaded from signing @entity9 due to pressure from sponsors as well as criticism from leading politicians and also the @entity8 public , with thousands signing petitions against his proposed moves			1
asked if @entity9 looked likely to sign for another @entity8 side , chief executive of the @entity38 @entity37 told the @entity39 : " at this moment in time , you would have to say you 'd be very doubtful of that			1
" it may well be he would have to go abroad but at the moment because he 's out on license he ca n't go abroad so we need a serious rethink now			0
" previously refused leave to appeal , @entity48 's case is now before the @entity50 , an independent body that reviews potential miscarriages of justice			2
@entity55 manager @entity54 admitted he had backed @entity12 to sign @entity9 and also believes the @entity50 will be key to his hopes of playing again			1
" i might be upsetting people but there is a question of the rape and how he 's been convicted by a jury , " said @entity54 in his press conference prior to saturday 's @entity59 game between @entity55 and @entity60			1
" when you do look at the case and look at the evidence then certainly @entity9 has got a case			1
" for me the appeal ca n't come quick enough for @entity72			0
it must be a frustrating and difficult time for him and i think the events of the appeal , for me , will see @entity9 be allowed to play football again			1
" @entity21 , whom @entity9 originally joined on leaving @entity79 in 2009 , pulled out of their initial approach to sign the player on his release from prison in october following a 160,000 - strong petition against the move			1
and more than 60,000 people signed a petition calling on @entity12 not sign @entity9			2
@entity88 also signaled their interest only to then back away , while a potential move to @entity92 club @entity91 was quashed when the @entity93 clarified its zero - tolerance policy on sex offenders working abroad			0
@entity9 ' case has also put @entity38 chief @entity37 under pressure after he likened the situation with @entity99 to that of the families of the 96 people that lost their lives in the @entity106 disaster in 1989			1
the tragedy struck following a crush of people at the @entity111 semi-final between @entity112 and @entity113 in @entity114			0
after years of appeals by the families involved over the miscarriage of justice , an inquest is now ongoing into events and culpability surrounding the tragedy			0
" he would n't have been the first person to be found guilty , maintained their innocence and be proved right. , " said @entity37 in an interview with the @entity39 , referring to @entity9			1
" we know that happened with @entity106			2
" it 's now unraveling and very different to how it was portrayed at the time , indeed by the police at the time			0
" @entity37 's comments led to calls for him to stand down from his post while dr @entity138 , the main author of the @entity140 report , wrote to him concerning his " ill - judged " remarks			2
" drawing @entity106 into the maelstrom that has surrounded the @entity9 case ... while suggesting a parallel between these two entirely distinct cases demonstrates not only poor judgment but also extraordinary naivety , " @entity138 wrote			1
@entity37 has since backtracked on his previous remarks apologizing for any offense called			2
" i was n't comparing the case but i was looking for a comparison of the principle really of people looking to have the right to maintaining their innocence and how it 's become a national issue and campaign with regard to @entity9 , " said @entity37 in an interview with @entity151			1
" in no way was it a comparison of the offenses , it was the principle of establishing the truth and his right to do that			0
" as it has turned out , i do n't want to upset any of the @entity106 family support groups			2
" we 've always been supportive of them			0
it 's far from that			0
i admire the way , the tenacity and determination to get to the truth and that was the point i was looking to make			0
" the last thing i was wanting to do was offend any of them -- quite the opposite			0
" and with @entity9 of course he similarly has that right			2
he 's done his time in prison and has done longer in prison than normal because he 's determined to prove his innocence and has the right to return to work			0
" under current rules , @entity9 is permitted to return to playing football despite still serving his conviction on license			1
but chairman of the @entity193 @entity192 admitted the regulations may change the over eligibility of players to return to the game under certain circumstances			0
in the first statement from the @entity193 amid the @entity9 furore , @entity192 said in a statement : " rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable			2
this can not be overstated			0
" we have reviewed the @entity9 case in some detail at the @entity193 and we have examined both the legal requirements and our rules and regulations , and there is no basis for us to intervene directly in this particular case			1
" that said , it is important that we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football , and recognize the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a participating member of the national game			0
" i would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct			0
" the @entity193 will certainly be considering it in line with our own ongoing review of what constitutes public or private communications and behavior			0
