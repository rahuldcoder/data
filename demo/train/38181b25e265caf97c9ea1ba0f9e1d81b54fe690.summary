i wo n't take it personally if you yawn while reading this story			0
chances are you 're sleep deprived			1
sleep deprivation is such a rampant problem that last year the @entity9 called insufficient sleep a public health epidemic			1
teenagers may be suffering the most			1
researchers at @entity15 's @entity14 called the problem " the @entity17 " in a new study published in the journal @entity20			1
they surveyed more than 270,000 teens in eighth , 10th and 12th grades between 1991 and 2012 and found teens are getting less and less sleep			1
the average amount is seven hours a day , which is two hours less than the nine hours they should be snoozing			0
african - american and @entity30 boys are the least likely to sleep enough			2
but why ? @entity31 , lead researcher and assistant professor of epidemiology at @entity34 , says researchers do n't know			2
she and her team speculate that increased @entity37 and social media use is a factor as well as pressure and competition over the college admissions process			0
not everyone gets all their sleep at night though			2
babies and toddlers , for example , take naps to get it all in			0
but a new study published in the journal @entity52 says toddlers sleep better at night without the naps			1
@entity55 researchers reviewed 26 previously published studies and found that napping beyond age 2 is linked to poor quality sleep at night			1
and , as many parents of toddlers will attest to , it can also lead to an array of stalling tactics and protests at bedtime			0
the authors of the study say there is no scientific evidence to continue having children older than 2 nap and recommend discontinuing it , especially if the child has trouble sleeping at night			2
we know not getting enough sleep causes all kinds of harm to our minds and bodies no matter your age			2
study after study tell us so			2
sleep deprivation causes us to eat more , it shrinks our brains , is linked to type 2 diabetes , leads to slow reaction time that can impair driving and can even cause false memories			1
and that list could go on and on			0
so how much sleep do we need ? the @entity92 , recently issued new recommendations on how much sleep we should all be getting			1
they are based on a review of research and a consensus from a group of 18 experts in sleep , science , physiology and medicine			2
there are now nine age categories , some of them new			0
anything more or less than the identified range is simply not recommended : newborns ( 0 to 3 months ) -- 14 to 17 hours per day infants ( 4 to 11 months ) -- 12 to 15 hours per day toddlers ( 1 to 2 years old ) -- 11 to 14 hours per day preschoolers ( 3 to 5 years old ) -- 11 to 14 hours per day school age ( 6 to 13 years old ) -- 9 to 11 hours per day teens ( 14 to 17 years old ) -- 8 to 10 hours per day younger adults ( 18 to 25 years old ) -- 7 to 9 hours per day adults ( 26 to 64 years old ) -- 7 to 9 hours per day older adults ( 65 and older ) -- 7 to 8 hours per day while there is plenty of research confirming all that goes wrong when you do n't get enough sleep , there are also proven steps people can take to help fall asleep and sleep better once they do fall asleep			1
a new study published in the journal @entity130 says mindful meditation helps adults fall asleep and stay asleep			1
researchers at the @entity134 , @entity135 , randomly assigned 49 adults , age 55 and older , who experienced minor sleep disturbances , to one of two groups for one year			1
one group was taught mindfulness meditation , which they practiced for 20 minutes per day			0
the other group went through sleep hygiene education intervention , which changes daily behaviors and other factors believed to be causing sleep problems			0
those who used mindful meditation ended up sleeping better than those in the other group			1
of course , a larger study is needed to confirm this finding			0
but the idea of relaxation leading to better sleep is not so far - fetched			0
in fact , the @entity92 recommends a relaxing bedtime ritual and winding down before bed			1
it also suggests waking up and going to bed at the same time every day , using bright lights to help wake up , avoiding naps and avoiding heavy meals , alcohol and cigarettes at night			0
it 's a lot to think about			0
hopefully it wo n't keep you up , and you 'll be having sweet dreams , and enough of them , in no time .			0
