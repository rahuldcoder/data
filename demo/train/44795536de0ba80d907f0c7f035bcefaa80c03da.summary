@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 and @entity4 have been together for six years			1
as a gay couple , they 've watched heterosexual members of their families celebrate their big days wondering if they will ever enjoy their own			0
but this week could herald the start of a new life for these two @entity12 : married life			2
in a bold move , the lower house of the @entity15 will introduce the @entity17 co-sponsored by the ruling @entity18 and the @entity19			1
it is expected to easily pass			0
the more difficult proposition will be convincing the state 's @entity22 of 15 -- 13 of whom are independents -- to buy the argument of premier @entity27 , that the change will deliver a aus $ 100 million ( us $ 103 million ) economic boost to the state in gay tourism			2
if the upper house ticks off on the bill , @entity32 will become the first state in @entity1 to legalize same sex marriage			1
and there 's every chance it will quickly be followed by @entity1 , the @entity39 and the @entity40			1
if they succeed , they will join 11 nations where same sex marriage is now legal , including @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 , along with some @entity50 states			1
@entity51 is also likely to pass same sex marriage laws			1
but as these historic changes blow across @entity1 , the prime minister , @entity55 , and her counterpart in opposition , @entity56 , insist marriage is a vow between a man and a woman			1
he will be among those lining up to marry if the bill passes			2
" the time for the proposal comes once the law is passed , " he told @entity2			0
" i would love to marry but i think it 's only right for me to propose that to the man i love once the law is passed			1
" the face of the gay rights lobby , which in 1997 defeated the @entity32 law that made homosexuality a punishable crime , @entity62 is quietly confident as he acknowledges the challenges			1
for starters , there 's the prospect of a @entity81 challenge to the law , if it passes			0
" prime minister @entity55 has not ruled it out , " @entity62 said			1
only the @entity84 has the right to challenge a state law			0
anyone else has to obtain standing before the @entity81 and to do that , they have to show a material disadvantage ( as a result of the law ) and it 's hard to see how anyone -- such as the @entity95 or the @entity40 @entity97 lobby could show that , " he said			0
" so if the @entity84 says no , there may not be a challenge at all , " he added			0
between the law passing and any @entity81 challenge , it 's anticipated thousands will marry			0
@entity62 estimates more than 50 % of @entity32 's same sex couples will rush to the alter and many thousands will flock to @entity32 from other @entity40 states and territories to do the same			1
@entity3 , 30 and @entity4 , 27 , both feel same sex marriage in @entity32 , at least , is inevitable			1
" we have seen the changes happening in the last decade , " @entity3 , a union worker told @entity2			1
" even just five years ago , you 'd cop it just walking down the streets			0
but now that people are more socially aware and there 's generational change , that paradigm is shifting so i do n't get anywhere near as much slack			0
in fact , i get encouragement , " he said			0
" having this issue in the media makes people think about it too , " said @entity4 , a hairdresser			1
for both men , at the heart of the same sex marriage issue is the question of social equality and personal validation			1
" i grew up in @entity135 on the north - west coast of @entity32 , which was very homophobic and it 's been a long journey for me			2
and there are always the odd few people who are still narrow minded , " said @entity3			2
" this is one of the last things that discriminates against gay people , " added @entity4 , referring to the @entity140 , which deems marriage as an act between a man and a woman			1
neither man minds if the right to marry each other comes from the @entity32 parliament rather than its federal counterpart			1
" it 's equality in @entity32 , " he said			2
many see it as paving the way for broader change			0
" some find it odd that it should proceed state by state but in every other federal nation around the world , the movement began at a state level -- @entity46 , the @entity50 , @entity44 , @entity167 , " he said			0
" so for @entity1 to begin at a state level is not an anomaly			1
" public support for same sex marriage is patchy across @entity1			1
but according to @entity62 , in @entity32 it is significant			2
" it took years to reach this level of public support , " he said			0
" some say it 's to do with @entity32 's convict past : that there were so many men cooped up for so long that the convict era came to be associated with homosexuality and so there was a shame associated with the convict past			2
" whatever the cause of the shift in public thinking , @entity62 is convinced that if the bill passes into law , " it will be an historic moment			0
" for @entity3 it would be a deeply personal affirmation to know that " even in our own conscience , we are equal to others			2
" and for his partner , it would be the moment @entity1 comes of age , tipping its hat to equal rights for all @entity40 -- religious or otherwise			2
" the important point in this debate is that some people are consumed with the church 's beliefs , " he said			0
" but we live in a secular society			0
i grew up in a @entity95 family , my mum still attends church and she 's a supporter of marriage equality , as are my godparents			0
" whether via state by state stealth or an amendment to the @entity140 , as @entity62 puts it : " there will be a lot of gay people who are married -- and they will remain married			0
" the @entity219 in the meantime is readying to vote on changes to the @entity140 to allow same sex marriage			1
with only the ruling @entity18 permitting its members a conscience vote , the chance of change is miniscule .			0

@entity15 will introduce the @entity17 this week
@entity32 could become the first state in @entity1 to legalize same sex marriage
pm @entity55 , opposition leader @entity56 say marriage is vow between man and woman
