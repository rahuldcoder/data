-- if it was just a political pander , it was a beauty			0
but if it was a serious statement of philosophy , it was chilling -- even scary			2
@entity5 , the @entity6 candidate who has vaulted to within an inch of @entity8 due to her boasting of hog castration in this year 's most inventive political ad , was speaking to the @entity12 in 2012			1
" i do believe in the right to carry , and i believe in the right to defend myself and my family -- whether it 's from an intruder , or whether it 's from a government , should they decide that my rights are no longer important			1
" huh ? this notion -- that the @entity22 gives citizens the right to fire upon federal officials , or their local police , or sheriffs or even @entity29 military personnel -- is common among right wingers			1
but it 's one thing to hear , say , goofball @entity32 honk off that way			2
( @entity36 , by the way , has boasted about how he avoided taking up arms in defense of his country during @entity41			0
) it is another to know that someone with those loopy views is one step away from the @entity8			0
the @entity47 blogger @entity46 has asked the right question -- the one any @entity6 voter should be putting to ms. @entity5 : " since you brought it up , exactly what circumstances would justify you shooting a police officer or a soldier in the head ? " good question , @entity56 is it ok to do so if , say , the @entity58 stops the counting of votes so as to give the presidency to the candidate who got fewer votes ? i do n't think so			1
how about segregation ? if ever @entity29 citizens were oppressed by their government it was african - americans under @entity70			1
thank @entity72 we had dr. @entity73 and not ms. @entity5 leading the civil rights movement			2
perhaps ms. @entity5 reserves her bloody right to truly egregious government actions , like ensuring affordable health care , even to folks with pre-existing conditions ? @entity80 , i hope not			1
as @entity81 notes in his excellent new book , " @entity83 , a biography , " the @entity22 was designed to ensure that citizen - soldiers would be the heart of our national defense			1
a standing army , such as we have now , would have been anathema to our founders			2
indeed , @entity96 , in his first annual message to @entity94 ( now known as the @entity95 ) , said , " nor is it conceived needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up in time of peace			0
" should @entity29 be invaded , @entity96 said , the proper response was " the body of neighboring citizens as formed into a militia			2
" the founders thought citizen - soldiers would be the military , acting on behalf of the government			1
they did not advocate armed citizens taking on federal officials			2
do n't believe me ? ask @entity111			0
gen. @entity111 , as president , forcefully rejected the notion that @entity29 citizens had a revolutionary right to take up arms against their government -- even against the most hated government officials enforcing the most hated government program			2
president @entity111 and his treasury secretary , @entity122 , sought to enforce a tax on whiskey , which @entity94 passed in 1791			0
a group of @entity127 whiskey distillers objected , violently			0
in what was known as the @entity130 , they refused to pay the tax and burned the home of the federal tax collector			0
@entity111 personally led 13,000 troops to crush the rebellion ( the only time a president has commanded troops in the field )			0
@entity111 was willing to shed blood to ensure no one took up arms against his or her own country			0
to argue that the @entity22 allows citizens to turn their guns on their government is to repudiate the actions of @entity111 , as well as the @entity147 itself			1
i say this as a gun owner -- and i 'm not just talking about some puny 9 mm like the one ms. @entity5 brags about			1
at last count i have 22 guns			1
i use them to hunt , shoot targets , and bond with my family			0
my grandfather was a hunter and gun owner , as is my father , as am i -- as are my sons			0
but neither we , nor ms. @entity5 nor any @entity29 has the right to turn those weapons on @entity29 military personnel , peace officers or other government officials			1
to suggest otherwise betrays our founders , our @entity147 , and common sense .			0

@entity171 : @entity6 candidate @entity5 told @entity12 she has right to use her gun against government
he says : this is scary . here 's a question for @entity178 : under what circumstances is it ok do this ?
founders : citizen - soldiers might act on behalf of government , not shoot at it , he says
@entity171 owns 22 guns . citizens do n't have right to turn weapons on police , military , government
