-- economists might not like how quickly the economy has or has not rebounded from the recession , but if the country is still struggling financially , someone forgot to tell the @entity6			1
@entity9 children are receiving an average of $ 3.70 per lost tooth this year -- up 23 % from last year 's $ 3 , an annual survey said			1
@entity13 's annual survey , based on 3,000 telephone interviews , reported that 90 % of @entity9 households will be receiving a visit from the @entity6 this year			1
the fairy was most generous to children in the @entity19 , who earned an average of $ 4.10 per tooth			1
in the @entity24 , children received $ 3.30 per tooth ; and the @entity26 and @entity27 fell in the middle , at $ 3.60 and $ 3.70 , respectively			1
male tooth fairies leave more than female , and in 36 % of households , tooth fairies left less than a dollar			2
families with a household income of $ 40,000 to $ 45,000 gave more than any other income group			2
@entity37 , senior director of global financial education for @entity13 , said the reason for that might be that it 's an " area where parents can feel like they can be generous			1
" while the study is n't necessarily proof of out - of - control inflation , @entity37 said the study , inspired by his daughter , will hopefully inspire other parents to give their children a financial education			2
" my daughter had zero interest in money , " he said			0
" money management was n't interesting to her			0
" but , he said , she was transfixed by the idea of the @entity6 leaving something behind when she finally lost a tooth			1
@entity37 saw this as an opportunity for a " teachable moment			0
" " parents can then talk to their kids about how they plan to spend their money			0
they can use real money to talk about saving and giving , " he said			0
that 's a great idea , unless , of course , you give your child an antique typewriter			0
that 's exactly what @entity37 said one of his son 's classmates received for a lost tooth			2
" i 'm still not sure how you fit a typewriter under a pillow , " he said			0
while elaborate gifts are the exception , 6 % in the survey said the @entity6 left $ 20 or more ; 2 % said she left $ 50			1
with such a wide spectrum , parents of children losing their first teeth might find it hard deciding what the @entity6 should give			2
" nobody wants to be the cheapskate ; no one wants to give too much , " @entity37 said			0
for those parents , he said , @entity13 created an app that allows people to enter demographics information -- like household income and age -- to give a better idea of what tooth fairies who live like them are giving			1
@entity37 said he 's always given his kids a dollar for their lost teeth , which seemed to be the standard in the neighborhood ( minus the typewriter , of course )			0
" no one wants to be the parent their kid is talking about on the playground , " he said .			0
