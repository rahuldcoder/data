-- on separate trips to @entity3 and @entity4 in the late 1980s and in the early 2000s , we each saw the devastating effect of the water and sanitation crisis firsthand			1
we saw a world in which basic needs went drastically unmet -- where a lack of safe water and sanitation robbed men , women and children of health , hope and even life			1
in the time it takes us to fill a glass of water -- about 21 seconds -- a child in some part of the world has died because of water - related disease			2
watch video : @entity26 on the ubiquitous force the disturbing fact is that we 've known how to deliver safe water and basic sanitation to people for more than 100 years			1
so , why are people still dying today because of it ? can you imagine if we had a cure for @entity36 and millions of people continue to perish because of the inability to deliver treatment ? it would be outrageous			1
yet , more than 3.4 million people die each year from water , sanitation and hygiene - related causes			1
most of these illnesses and deaths can be prevented			2
for example , diarrhea remains the second - leading cause of death among children younger than 5 globally			2
nearly one in five child deaths -- about 1.5 million each year -- is because of diarrhea			2
it kills more young children than @entity36 , malaria and measles combined			2
knowledge of that alarming reality drove us to action			0
in 2009 , we co-founded @entity63 , an organization dedicated to ending this crisis in our lifetime			2
from the beginning , we focused on finding solutions that wo n't depend solely upon charity			0
we came up with @entity69 , which applies the principles of microfinance to the water and sanitation sector			1
through the program , individuals take affordable , small loans to finance the water and / or sanitation solution that works for them			1
according to our internal analysis , we 've empowered more than 1 million people to gain access to safe water or sanitation			1
our research also shows that investment in @entity69 reaches five to 10 times as many people as a traditional grant over a 10 - year period			1
at the current rate , we believe we could end the global water and sanitation crisis for nearly 100 million people by 2020			1
safe water and toilets change everything			1
when you see the difference it makes in a community , it 's the difference between night and day			0
we met lively , excited children , and women moving with ease and natural , joyful energy			0
we spent time with a group of children at a school where they demonstrated hand - washing techniques and talked about the important things in life -- their classrooms , their teachers and friends			0
we know about @entity115 , who was living with many family members in in a village outside of a rapidly growing city in @entity120			0
" we have 16 people in the house			2
five years ago , we constructed our home by taking out a loan but we did not build a toilet			0
nobody had a toilet in the village , and no one thought about having one in the house , " said @entity126			0
" all of us used to go out in the open for defecation			0
but now as the population is increasing , there is no space for this			0
" @entity126 said his children are all becoming more educated and doing more " modern " work			0
he questioned how he and the family could go on defecating out in the open			0
given the progress the world around him was making , it seemed ironic to him that his family did not have a toilet in the home			0
@entity115 made the decision to construct a toilet to make life better for his family			0
by taking out a @entity69 loan of 7,000 rupees ( $ 112 @entity156 dollars ) from @entity63 's local microfinance partner , the @entity157 for the @entity158 , he was able to build a toilet			1
he has 3 acres of land where he grows groundnuts , sorghum and finger millet			0
the yield from his crops helps him earn money , which he uses to repay the loan amount in easy monthly installments			0
having a toilet means his family no longer was hindered by the time - consuming and physical constraints of open defecation			0
the change improved productivity and restored dignity			1
for many others , it saved health and transformed lives			2
we hope that in the coming year , more organizations , both in the private and public sector , will double down on water and sanitation - related investments			1
together , we can accelerate the pace of progress against the enormous but solvable crisis			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 and @entity26 .			1

@entity192 , @entity26 : millions die each year from lack of safe water and sanitation
@entity192 , @entity26 : with @entity69 program , we could help end the global water crisis
they say clean water access improve productivity , restore dignity and transform lives
@entity192 , @entity26 : we hope more people will get involved with this *big* but solvable crisis
