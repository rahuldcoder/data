@entity0 -- a @entity3 federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law			1
the law , signed by gov. @entity8 on friday , bans doctors from performing abortions if they do n't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice			1
@entity16 district judge @entity15 granted the hold monday after the @entity18 of @entity3 filed suit			1
the group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures			1
" there is a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges requirement , " he wrote in his 19 - page ruling			2
he added that the @entity16 @entity32 precedent places the burden upon states to show such laws are " reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health			0
" to that end , " the record to date strongly supports a finding that no medical purpose is served by this requirement , " he said			0
the restraining order will stay in place pending a fuller hearing on july 17			1
the law , which took effect monday , also requires women to have an ultrasound before getting an abortion , but that portion of the law was not challenged in the @entity18 suit			2
opponents of the @entity3 legislation allege that restrictions in the law would force the closing of several abortion clinics , and that the law is simply a way to make access to abortions more difficult			2
supporters insist that it would guarantee a safer environment for a woman suffering from abortion - related complications			0
judge @entity15 questioned that contention , saying , " the current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications			0
" @entity1 reached out to @entity8 's office for response and is awaiting a response			0
@entity76 abortion showdown continues @entity1 's @entity77 contributed to this report .			0
