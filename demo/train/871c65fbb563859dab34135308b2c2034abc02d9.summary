-- former @entity2 president @entity1 has come out in favor of legalizing drugs in an attempt to disrupt the illegal markets that have turned parts of @entity2 into battlegrounds			1
in a proposal published over the weekend on his website , @entity1 argued that drug addiction and drug - related violence should be treated as distinct and separate challenges			1
" so , drug consumption is the responsibility of the person who consumes ; of the family who is responsible for educating ; and of the education system and the socioeconomic context , " wrote @entity1 , who was president from 2000 to 2006			1
" what we have to do is legalize the production , the sale and the distribution			0
" although @entity1 and current president @entity28 both hail from the conservative @entity29 , or @entity29 , their views diverge on the issue of how to combat drug violence			1
while @entity33 advocates weakening the cartels by legalizing their market , @entity28 has launched an offensive against the drug cartels that has resulted in headline - grabbing drug - related violence in some parts of @entity2			1
according to the government , more than 28,000 people have been killed in the drug war since @entity28 took office in 2006			2
@entity1 said @entity2 troops should return to the barracks			1
the army was not designed nor trained to fight organized crime , @entity1 said			2
removing the troops would also ensure that soldiers would not cross the line into human rights abuses			0
in his proposal , @entity33 also called for the creation of a single national police to provide security , arguing that current state and local police bodies have become corrupted			0
some teams from the military could be added to the new police force , he said			0
a third proposal was for citizens to directly elect police chiefs , commanders and others in charge of security			0
" legalizing in this sense does n't mean that drugs are good or do n't hurt those who consume , " @entity1 wrote			2
" rather , we have to see it as a strategy to strike and break the economic structure that allows the mafias to generate huge profits in their business			0

@entity1 says legalizing drugs is best way to *destabilize* the drug cartels
@entity1 was president of @entity2 from 2000 - 2006
