-- the debate has gone on for years			0
the athletes in big - time college sports bring in billions of dollars for their universities and the @entity5 , but get nothing in return -- other than a scholarship that does not even cover the full cost of attending school			1
until now , it has been largely a philosophical discussion among academics and sports enthusiasts			2
are college athletes amateurs ? are they being exploited ? should college sports be kept " pure " ? but thanks to a decision by @entity19 last week and a class action lawsuit filed against the @entity5 , the questions have moved out of the theoretical and into the courtroom			1
' amateurism is a myth ' : athletes file class - action against @entity5 labor board : @entity29 football players can unionize the lawsuit challenges the @entity5 's rules against player compensation as an illegal agreement among universities to fix the prices paid to college athletes			1
the @entity19 decision found that @entity29 football players are employees of the school and are therefore entitled to unionize			0
taken together , the mighty @entity5 has never been more vulnerable in its tired defense of college sports as an amateur pastime , and in its depiction of college athletes as merely students who also play ball			1
while their objectives seem simple enough , the legal battle will be fierce , as will the inevitable appeals to the @entity19 's groundbreaking ruling			0
for years , the @entity5 and its defenders have argued the player compensation ban is necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports and the educational mission of the @entity5 and its member universities			1
once that system is broken , they claim , college sports will never be the same			1
nor will the governing ideal that these players are students first , and athletes second			2
but we are well past the time to deflate the myth of what major college football and basketball are really all about			1
it is not about serving the so - called " student - athletes			2
" or fostering their educational pursuits			0
or protecting them from commercial exploitation			0
or safeguarding the integrity of the game			0
and it certainly has nothing to do with the mythical notion of amateurism			2
instead , major college football and basketball is all about the money			2
and the money is substantial			0
the @entity5 and its members rake in billions of dollars a year -- with nearly $ 1 billion of that coming just from the three - week @entity85 men 's basketball tournament			1
head coaches are paid in the millions , in some cases out - earning their @entity89 and @entity90 counterparts			2
in most cases , head football or basketball coaches at state schools are the highest paid public employees in a state			2
even the university athletic directors , conference commissioners , bowl organizers and @entity5 executives get their sizable share of the booty			1
major college football and basketball is an industry where everyone profits -- everyone , except the athletes			1
it is no accident why			0
to put it simply , the @entity5 rules prevent college athletes from being compensated in any way connected with their sport other than a limited athletic scholarship			1
they can not even accept textbooks , a bag of groceries or a trip home to see their parents			0
nor are they allowed to access the free market for their own promotional and marketing deals			0
and forget about getting advice or representation from a sports agent			0
it is all off - limits			0
to the @entity5 and its members go all the spoils , while the players toil away , sacrificing their education and physical well - being , to fuel this multi-billion dollar corporate enterprise			1
in any other industry , this system would have been condemned long ago as a per se illegal price - fixing conspiracy ( not to mention a blatant violation of the most basic labor laws )			0
the @entity5 and its members , however , have for years successfully hidden behind the orwellian concept of " amateurism " as a legal and economic justification for this scheme			1
the time when major college football and basketball were ever truly considered " amateur " sports has long since passed			1
what remains is a wide - ranging conspiracy to maintain and solidify the very exploitation the @entity5 and its members profess they are guarding against			1
if protecting the college athlete from commercialization were really the @entity5 's concern , it would restrict or eliminate this commercialization in the first place			1
no corporate branding on uniforms , stadiums and arenas			0
no corporate sponsorships of bowl games and tournaments			0
no mass merchandizing of player jerseys and apparel			0
no 10 - figure television deals			0
and no scheduling of game times to accommodate prime time ratings ( without regard to academic schedules )			0
instead , the @entity5 and its members feed the corporate frenzy and keep all the proceeds for themselves			1
the @entity5 could also employ a number of softer alternatives to its blanket ban on player compensation			1
it could create a revenue share " lock box " which athletes could draw upon for educational or career development pursuits			0
it could follow the @entity189 model of amateurism and allow athletes open access to the commercial free market for endorsement and promotional deals			2
and it could make available a slew of benefits and subsidies to better protect the health and educational well - being of the players			0
in not adopting these alternatives , the @entity5 and its members have made it clear that either they have no real concerns about amateurism , or they have no real concern for the well - being of their big - time athletes			1
to be sure , the two - pronged assault on the @entity5 remains very much an uphill battle			2
there have been numerous legal challenges to the @entity5 ban on player compensation and virtually all of them have failed			2
the courts just do n't seem willing to upset the archaic model of amateur college sports , an ideal even the @entity219 has recognized as worthy of protection			1
but this class - action case is unique in its " full - monty " attack on the system and the undeniable fact that whatever big - time college sports once was , it can no longer be described honestly as any kind of amateur pursuit			1
the @entity19 ruling is likewise firmly grounded in this reality of what major college sports has become			1
whatever ultimately happens on this new legal front , this twin - challenge to the @entity5 should serve as a much needed wake - up call			2
one way or another , this supposed guardian of the student - athlete needs to do a much better job of serving and protecting those within its ultimate charge			0
join us on @entity244 / @entity243 .			0

@entity246 and @entity247 argue that amateurism in college sports is now a myth
college athletes , they say , are *responsible* for the billions the @entity5 earns each year
they should be paid , they argue , and not exploited
