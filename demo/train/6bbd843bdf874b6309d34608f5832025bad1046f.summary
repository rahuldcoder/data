it 's @entity2 , that time of year when men everywhere grow ridiculous looking mustaches to raise awareness about men 's health			1
@entity8 photographer @entity7 may not be able to grow a bushy mustache , but that has n't stopped her from taking her own " hairied " journey			1
yes , that 's a woman in those photos			1
for the second year in a row , the short - haired , part - time office manager has been transforming herself into old - timey mustached men with the help of black face paint , some hair gel , a few props and an @entity21			1
she shoots hundreds of photos in slightly different poses and picks her favorites to make her @entity26 profile picture throughout the month			0
she recently shared some of them on @entity29 with the headline " just a crazy woman wearing mustaches			2
" as she describes it , " what started out as a wacky @entity2 mustache photo project turned into a serious exercise in making me unrecognizable even to myself			0
" send us your @entity2 selfies while some of these mustached - characters may look familiar , most are n't based on real people though @entity7 draws inspiration from her @entity46 family and old photographs she finds online			1
she estimates she owns more than 50 mustaches of varying thicknesses , her favorite being the big and bushy style			2
this year , in particular , she 's going with a ' 40s - inspired look			1
she 's modest about her talents , hesitating to call herself an artist despite a degree in painting and drawing and a freelance art and photography business			2
" i love doing it and it 's definitely fun , " she said			2
" i try not to fixate too much on just one			0
it either works or it does n't			2
" it all started last year around this time			0
@entity7 had some goofy stick - on mustaches lying around			1
she decided to take a picture wearing one and post it on @entity26 in honor of the @entity2 campaign			0
she thought about posting one every day of the month , but quickly got bored			0
that 's when the characters began to come to life			2
@entity7 used props she found around the house and bought more realistic - looking mustaches from an online theater supply shop			1
" i decided to spice it up a little , and then eventually my friends were like , ' i do n't even see you in this photo			2
' and that made me think , ' wow , let me see what i can really do with this			0
' " soon , @entity7 's friends were finding her pictures unrecognizable and her face completely lost in the midst of makeup and facial hair			1
@entity7 says she has always liked playing characters			1
you can see her zany sketches on @entity92 , including a woman named @entity94 , who she describes as " this drunk person who 's really drunk all the time			2
" after last year 's @entity2 series , she compiled her characters in a self - published book for her friends			0
if she ever makes any real money from the book , she says she 'll donate a portion of the proceeds to the @entity104			1
to become her mustachioed men , @entity7 plays around with accents and poses , extending her jaw or turning her head in a certain way to manipulate the look			1
then it 's time for the shot			0
no fancy camera or tripod here -- @entity7 does it , selfie - style , with an @entity118			1
for the final effects , she makes no alterations in @entity121 but uses photo apps on her phone to add filters , brighten the images and achieve the vintage feel			0
" even though my pictures are not real , in that i 'm trying to be someone else , i try to make sure they 're real without altering them too much digitally , " she said			0
" keeping the fake real is what i 'm trying to do			0
" the entire process can take a couple hours and ends with @entity7 looking nothing like herself			1
" people ask me , ' oh , who is this in the photo ? and i 'm always like , that 's me , ' " she said			0
" my stepdad tells me all the time that it 's not me in the photos			0
" and that 's exactly what she wants			0
" my goal is to lose myself , " she said			0
" if someone ca n't recognize me , i have done my job			1

photographer @entity7 was inspired to take her own " hairied " journey
