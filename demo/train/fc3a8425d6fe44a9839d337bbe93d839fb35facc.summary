@entity0 -- shock jock @entity4 's addition as a judge on @entity7 's " @entity6 " could cost advertisers " countless millions of dollars in customer goodwill , " a parents group is warning			1
" @entity7 's decision to add mr. @entity4 to @entity6 will likely result in a sharp increase in explicit content , and we urge you to be mindful when considering a media buy , " @entity10 , president of the @entity11 , said in a letter to 91 companies that have previously bought time on the show			1
@entity4 , whose show is heard on @entity23 , was hired to replace @entity1 host @entity24 as a judge for the seventh season of the highly rated talent competition			1
the show , which returns to tv on may 14 , is mostly broadcast live			2
@entity7 did not respond to multiples @entity1 requests for comment on the letter monday morning			0
@entity4 's publicist pointed @entity1 to an online video of interviews of three unidentified women who attended a recent show taping			1
all three women said before the taping that they expect to stern to be crude			0
they each praised his performance afterward			0
" he was n't that crude today , " one woman said			0
" he did make a 7 - year - old cry ; however , i think he did a great job and he was fair			0
" another woman said she cried when @entity4 hugged that child to make him feel better			1
when @entity10 's group issued a statement in december calling @entity4 's hiring " an act of desperation for a flailing network , " @entity4 responded with a call to @entity24 's @entity1 show			1
" networks shudder " at criticisms from such groups , @entity4 said			1
" they start to complain that i 'm some sort of weird pervert who 's going to convert @entity62 into zombie sex fiends , but i can assure you and the rest of @entity62 what i 'm looking at here is to be a very good judge			0
" @entity4 said he will take his judging duties seriously with a goal " to actually find someone who can become a major superstar			2
" the head of the @entity11 , which has a mission of " protecting children against sex , violence and profanity in entertainment , was not persuaded			1
winter asked potential sponsors to consider whether @entity4 's " decades - long penchant for profanity , his affinity for degrading and sexualizing women , and his proclivity for vulgar and explicit dialog " accurately reflect their corporate values			1
" @entity4 's reputation for sleaze and misogyny is well known ; and to our knowledge his only previous judging experience consisted of looking at insecure , naked young women and telling them whether or not they were hot enough to pose for @entity96 , " @entity10 wrote said			2
the letter quoted a radio broadcast in which @entity4 told a female guest : " i would like to kiss you and chop off your feet			2
... i wan na bite off your fingers			0
... i wan na have sex with you and throw you in a ditch ... ( and ) chop your head off			0
" " does such commentary accurately reflect your corporate values ? " @entity10 asked			0
advertisers must have a " presumption that mr. @entity4 will only continue to conduct himself in precisely the same manner as he has done for decades , " the letter said			2
" unless and until his conduct consistently reflects and respects the time , place and manner of an 8 p.m. broadcast television program , we would urge you and your advertising agency to consider alternate network television programming for your media dollars , " @entity10 said			0
while stopping short of declaring a boycott of the sponsors , @entity10 hinted it could happen			0
" i assure you that every advertiser on ' @entity6 ' will be held publicly accountable for underwriting any of the inevitably vile antics of @entity4 , " he said			1
" @entity6 " is one of the few prime time television shows that offer @entity62 families " a brief respite from the otherwise - ubiquitous stream of violent , profane and sexually explicit content , " he said			1
@entity1 's @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
