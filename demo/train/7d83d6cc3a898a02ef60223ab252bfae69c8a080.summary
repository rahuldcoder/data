-- in the new @entity3 comedy " @entity8 , " @entity1 plays the young chief of staff to the vice president of the @entity5 played by ex- " @entity7 " star @entity6			1
if the actress looks familiar , it may be because a few decades ago she starred in " @entity11 " opposite an equally adorable @entity12			1
the 31 - year - old @entity14 native took a break from acting , went to college and even worked as an editorial assistant for a year until she found her way back to her thespian roots			2
she recently spoke to @entity0 about the new show , politics and what it was like being a child star			1
@entity0 : are you interested in politics ? @entity1 : i 'm interested in current affairs and social policy as a whole , but i do n't watch politics for sport			1
i think people can get really wrapped up into it			2
when i was in college i was much more into it			2
i was an international studies major			2
@entity0 : what does that mean ? that you wanted to become a diplomat ? @entity1 : it 's a liberal arts education			1
you study things you like to learn , not to necessarily be anything in particular			2
@entity0 : did " @entity8 " make your more cynical about politics ? @entity1 : i find it to be kind of liberating in a way because really the spotlight that is put on people in politics is that they 're people			1
some people are really good at their jobs , some people are really bad			2
people have good and bad days			0
personally i find that to be liberating because when we mythologize our politicians , we put too many expectations on them , both positive and negative , and we kind of make them supernatural in a way			0
i think a better way is to think of politics as a pragmatic discipline			2
the idea that people are trying to work things out and make deals like anybody else kind of takes the scariness out of it			0
@entity0 : you became a big star when you were a kid			1
@entity1 : ( @entity72 ) i would n't say star			1
@entity0 : come on ! that movie was huge ! @entity1 : yeah the movie was big			1
@entity0 : was it weird having adults groveling and treating you differently ? @entity1 : it definitely makes you start to see the world in a different way in the sense you start to weigh who your friends were before and who your friends were after			1
as far as adults groveling , my mom was really wonderful about that on set			0
anytime somebody would ask what i wanted and i did n't ask her first i would get into trouble , and that was absolutely right			0
she was very sensitive to people treating me differently than anyone else on the crew , and i 'm so grateful she made a point of that			0
@entity0 : still , you 're on movie sets			1
@entity1 : i think what affected me the most was being taken out of school for a few months every once in a while			1
when i say i was n't a star , the reason why is most of my time was spent in school in @entity14			2
the movies felt more like a hobby			0
@entity0 : you dropped out for a while			1
@entity1 : it was not my decision at first			1
it was me going through puberty and not being cute on screen			0
i auditioned a lot during my adolescence for things and it just did n't take , so that took its toll because being an adolescent it can be less than fun to be told that someone does n't like you anymore			0
so that was pretty much what drove me to the conscious decision to give it a rest			0
also in college you learn you have all these other interests , and you really want to commit to them for the time being so that 's what i did			0
i thought i was not going to be an actress			0
i moved to @entity140 right after college and you see enough @entity143 shows , and i was inspired again to really give it a go for all the right reasons			0
@entity0 : you must have been nervous diving back in that you might not get work			1
@entity1 : yeah but that 's what was so great about coming to the decision as an adult because i kind of know that 's a hazard of the job			1
i had to prepare myself and know that i 'm strong enough to persevere through that , and i am rational enough to realize that only one person can get any role , and it does n't mean it 's personal			0
it does n't mean you 're bad			0
i came at it from a much healthier point of view .			0
