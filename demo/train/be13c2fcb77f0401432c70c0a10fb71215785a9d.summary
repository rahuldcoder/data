just days before the @entity1 play for the @entity3 football championship , star quarterback @entity0 is appearing before a panel that can decide whether he will continue as a student at the university			1
it 's been almost two years since the @entity9 winner was accused of sexually assaulting a then - @entity11 student			1
@entity0 was not arrested in connection with the alleged december 2012 incident , but he still could be charged by his university with a code - of - conduct violation for sexual misconduct , depending on the results of the school 's investigation			1
he could face a wide range of sanctions if he is found in violation -- from a reprimand or counseling to probation , suspension or expulsion			1
" this is the day that mr. @entity0 has been desperately trying to avoid for two years , " @entity28 , one of the attorneys representing the woman who accused @entity0 , told @entity31 on tuesday			1
" this courageous young woman finally gets the chance to stand up for herself and against mr. @entity0 and big - time college sports , which has long run over the rights and protection of women on campus			1
@entity11 breaks silence on @entity0 case " neither @entity0 nor his lawyer can stop what is coming			1
" @entity0 categorically denied the allegations in a statement			1
" i did not rape or sexually assault [ the accuser ]			0
i did not create a hostile , intimidating or offensive environment in the short period of time that we were together			0
[ the accuser ] had the capacity to consent to having sex with me and she repeatedly did so by her conduct and her verbal expressions			0
" he goes on to say , " rape is a vicious crime			0
the only thing as vicious as rape is falsely accusing someone of rape			0
" it seems improbable that a decision will be known before saturday , when @entity1 -- which has won 28 games in a row -- plays @entity67 with the @entity3 championship and a bid to the four - team @entity70 on the line			1
according to the university , a formal decision letter will be sent within 10 class days from the conclusion of the hearing			1
@entity1 's investigation was launched under @entity78 , which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault , even if criminal charges are never filed			0
the hearing has been delayed twice			0
@entity84 , who was @entity0 's attorney in the criminal investigation , has said @entity0 had consensual sex with the woman			1
according to police documents , the accuser said @entity0 raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a bar in @entity92			2
she said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar			0
the accuser said she did not remember little of what happened afterward , but that she did remember being in a ground - floor apartment where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections			0
the accuser reported the alleged assault to campus police that night			0
a month later , in january 2013 , she said the man who allegedly assaulted her was @entity0			2
@entity11 said in october that @entity0 informed the athletics department of the allegation after he was contacted by a @entity92 police detective			1
the university said the athletics department did not initially file a report with the school 's @entity78 administrator because no charges were filed and because other players who were with @entity0 said there was no sexual assault			1
a @entity78 investigation was opened after media inquiries , and after law enforcement had referred the case to the state attorney 's office			0
@entity92 interim police chief @entity125 said last year that the woman " broke off contact " with investigators in february 2013 and did n't want to go forward with the case			0
the woman 's family says a detective warned her attorney that @entity92 is a " big football town " and that life could be miserable if she pursued the case			0
in december 2013 , the @entity136 state attorney for the judicial circuit that includes @entity138 and @entity92 , announced that investigators did not have probable cause to arrest @entity0			2
later that month , @entity0 won the @entity9 , and in january 2014 the @entity1 defeated @entity141 to win the @entity143 national title			2
@entity0 spent the spring playing for the @entity1 baseball team , but off the field he continued to make headlines for the wrong reasons			2
in april , @entity0 was accused of shoplifting crab legs from a @entity151 grocery in @entity92			2
police said that @entity0 said he forgot to pay			2
as part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first - time , nonviolent offenses in @entity138 -- @entity0 was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service , authorities said			2
in september , @entity0 was suspended for the @entity1 ' game against @entity162 for yelling a sexually explicit remark near the school 's student union			1
@entity1 initially announced @entity0 would be suspended for the first half of the game after the sexual remark			0
however , athletics director @entity169 increased the punishment the day before the game after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from @entity0 's initial version , a source close to the situation told @entity31 's @entity175			1
in october , @entity176 reported that more than 2,000 authenticated autographs by @entity0 were discovered online			0
however , @entity1 said its athletic compliance department has not found evidence @entity0 accepted payment .			0

@entity0 categorically denies any rape claim in a statement
@entity11 student conduct code hearing for football star @entity0 begins
possible punishment ranges from a reprimand to expulsion from the university
the hearing comes just four days before @entity11 plays for the @entity3 championship
