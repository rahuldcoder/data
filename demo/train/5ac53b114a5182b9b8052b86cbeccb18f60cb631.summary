-- it may be one of the greatest victory laps of our time : @entity5 , @entity6 's political heroine , is touring the @entity7 , offering proof everywhere she goes -- from the @entity9 to the @entity11 rotunda , from @entity12 to @entity13 , from the @entity14 to @entity0 -- that she is indeed " the lady			1
" in @entity15 in june , she was able to give her acceptance speech , overdue by 21 years , for the @entity17 she had been awarded when she was under house arrest in @entity6			2
in the @entity7 , she 's been able to receive the @entity19 -- our highest honor -- she 'd been awarded years ago ; she was able to meet with the president , to sit with the @entity14 's secretary general and to meet many of the people who fought so hard to tell the world what the former military dictatorship was doing to her and to the @entity6 people			1
this week , she will visit @entity30 , meeting with local @entity6 and sitting down to dinner with members of the @entity13 community			2
and if one message rings through in all of her appearances , it is the strength of nonviolent reconciliation , the power of democratic ideals to triumph and what it really means to be willing to stand up for what one believes , whatever the cost			1
world : @entity5 is ' global symbol ' of progress , says @entity14 secretary it was @entity5 's nonviolent campaign against one of the most oppressive , dictatorial regimes of our times that gave hope to the oppressed @entity6 people and to thousands of @entity56 monks , as she inspired politicians and leaders around the globe			1
it was the strength of her spirit , the patience of her approach and the profound beauty of her soul			0
it was the message that one democratically elected ruler could withstand nearly 20 years of house arrest , could live with the memory of her father 's assassination , could overcome the separation from her cancer - stricken husband whom she was not allowed to visit on his deathbed and could galvanize a movement of monks and a nation of people to rise up and take back their country			0
now , @entity5 is using her international visibility to address ethnic divisions in @entity6 and to challenge the rest of the globe to behave more responsibly , even as she forgives the very military leaders who kept her under house arrest for the better part of two decades			1
the nation is also called @entity6 , but @entity5 refuses to use that name because it was changed by the military junta			2
so what does it mean for us , in @entity7 , during a polarizing election that seems to be bringing out the worst in all of us ? rhetoric , sound bites , culture wars and catchphrases are replacing substance , thoughtfulness and informed debate			0
and in the middle of it all , @entity13 , as usual , is manipulated by each side to demonize the other			0
it was n't so long ago , though , when our cultural leaders helped stand up and stand in for the most important voices of their day , raising issues all of us need to take more seriously			0
and , in fact , that 's precisely what happened with @entity6			2
just a few years ago , before most of us ever heard of @entity6 , before we could pronounce @entity5 's name and before we watched in horror as @entity117 ravaged its shores in 2008 , a group of us from the creative and human rights communities banded together to raise our voices around what was happening to @entity5 and the @entity6			1
we were able to pull together , left and right , young and old , @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity7 and foreigners , straights and gays , @entity126 , jews , @entity128 , @entity129 and atheists			0
all in a common cause of celebrating the voice of the people , the power of democracy and one remarkable woman			0
called " @entity6 : it ca n't wait , " it was an online video campaign featuring 38 spots to publicize what was happening in @entity6 and happening to @entity5			1
the campaign has received about 25 million views			0
what compelled nearly 100 of the industry 's most creative and committed people -- in front of and behind the camera -- to rally together to produce an award - winning online video campaign ? what led @entity150 to create another of his iconic images , inspired the likes of @entity154 and @entity155 to speak out and celebrities to travel to the @entity6 border to show their support for the refugees ? and , in another example of what people united by a common cause can do , what inspired 27 of the world 's most popular musical artists to contribute tracks in 2004 to an album called " @entity169 " ? one remarkable person			1
if you want to see why , read some of @entity5 's remarkable writings			2
" @entity175 , " published by @entity176 , provides a great collection of them			0
world : @entity6 democratic activist accepts tog congressional honor in these hyperpartisan times , as approval ratings for @entity181 reach record lows , as our public discourse focuses on name - calling and our media oversimplify the most complex issues , it 's refreshing to remember that many people were able to come together , from across a broad spectrum , to support a woman who had inspired @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 to rally to her defense			1
in a nation seemingly torn apart by divisiveness and conflict , on the eve of our presidential election , all of us should join together to champion the democratic traditions we cherish and to celebrate that much more that brings us together than divides us			0
as we enjoy @entity5 's tour of the @entity7 , may we be reminded of the strength of her spirit and the power of unity of purpose in service of our ideals			1
