-- controversial soccer star @entity1 will not be sacked by @entity2 despite his latest biting incident , but he faces a lengthy suspension			1
the @entity6 club said monday it had fined the @entity8 international for his assault on @entity11 defender @entity10 , and the @entity12 later announced the 26 - year - old has been charged with violent conduct			1
" it is the @entity12 's contention that the standard punishment of three matches that would otherwise apply is clearly insufficient in these circumstances , " the ruling body said			2
@entity1 , who was banned seven matches for biting an opponent during a @entity24 league game shortly before joining @entity2 in january 2011 , wrestled with @entity10 before sinking his teeth into the @entity27 's arm during sunday 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity29			1
photos : soccer 's most controversial foul play @entity1 has until tuesday to respond to the charge -- if he does n't then the hearing will take place wednesday			2
@entity37 prime minister @entity36 said any punishment for @entity1 needs to take into account his high profile and responsibility as a role model			1
" it is rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider , " a spokesman said			0
" as part of their consideration , i think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high - profile players are often role models			2
" @entity2 managing director @entity55 said team manager @entity56 will be working with @entity1 -- the @entity6 's top scorer this season with 23 goals -- to improve his discipline			1
" you can see when you speak to him how sorry he is about it and he 's certainly shown quite a lot of contrition to us -- and as part of that , he 's also asked we donate the fine to the @entity71 , " @entity55 said on the club 's website			1
. @entity1 was criticized by former @entity2 captain and manager @entity72 for bringing shame on the club the week after the 24th anniversary of the @entity78 tragedy , in which 96 people were killed			1
the @entity80 -- set up to help the victims of the crush that happened during the 1989 @entity84 match between @entity2 and @entity85 -- has accepted the donation , but said it was unhappy about the circumstances			2
" i would rather not be accepting the fine from @entity1 because i would rather he had not bitten that player , " its chair @entity89 told the @entity37 @entity90			1
" it is an awful thing at any time -- not just this particular week			0
we could refuse to accept it but it is going to have to go to someone , and he wants to show respect and remorse to the families			0
" @entity2 police said they would not be taking any further action after talking to @entity10 , who refused to press charges			2
@entity55 rejected any suggestion that @entity2 would seek to sell @entity1 , who was banned for eight matches for racially abusing @entity109 's @entity108 in october 2011 and was reprimanded by @entity56 after admitting that he dived during matches -- known as " simulation " -- to win free kicks and penalties			1
" it affects his future in the sense that we have to work with him on his discipline -- but @entity1 is a very important player to the club , " @entity55 said			1
" he 's a very popular player with his teammates			0
he signed a new four - year contract last summer and we 'd all love to see him here throughout that contract			0
he 's a fantastic player , top scorer and everything we 'd want in a striker , so there 's no change there			2
" this is more about getting him back on the right track and it 's largely down to @entity56 now to work with him on that side of his character			0
" @entity1 has been warned by his boot sponsor @entity136 that he must behave better			2
" @entity136 takes this type of incident very seriously and does not condone @entity1 's behavior , " it said in a statement monday			0
" we will be reminding him of the standards we expect from our players			0
" the head of @entity146 said that @entity1 needs help controlling his temper			0
" we have to work hard on anger management now			0
we have trained counselors in this field and we will be offering their services to @entity2 and the player to try to improve matters , " @entity151 chief executive @entity150 said			1
@entity1 is one of six nominees for the @entity151 player of the year award -- voted for by his peers -- which will be announced on sunday			1
" his reputation for controversy continues to increase when he can be such a good player , one of the world 's best , so it is a real dilemma now , " @entity150 told @entity161			0
@entity2 's @entity167 owners were widely criticized for not taking stronger action after the @entity170 incident , and for allowing former team manager @entity171 to publicly defend his player while the @entity12 was still investigating and after the verdict was announced			1
@entity55 said he had been in contact with the @entity175 , which also owns baseball 's @entity176 , about the best way to handle this situation			0
" with any incident like this , any major incident at the club , we 're in direct dialogue with the owners , always			0
i spoke to them last night and they were happy with the way we were handling the matter , " he said monday .			0
