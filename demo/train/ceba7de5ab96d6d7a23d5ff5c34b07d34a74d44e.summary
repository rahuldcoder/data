-- it has been branded " hateful and deliberately demeaning , " but the media is key to changing the way football works , says one leading economist			1
the game 's global governing body @entity6 has faced a slew of corruption allegations over the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity11 , most recently claims that bribes were paid to @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 officials in order to secure @entity18 the right to host the latter tournament			1
but former @entity22 chairman @entity21 insists that the pressure applied by the media towards football organizations helps to promote transparency and good governance			1
" it 's very legitimate , the questions being asked , more focus on it would be healthy , " said @entity21			2
" at the end of the day it is something that connects hundreds of millions , if not billions of people around the world , they deserve a better deal			0
" @entity21 argues that the media is the only body holding @entity6 accountable for its actions			1
" it forces them to take more responsibility , " he added			0
" i think the media here is a highly legitimate form of enforcing it			0
" the investigative work done by @entity52 newspaper the @entity53 in recent weeks has prompted a @entity6 backlash from key figures within the organization as well as president @entity57 , criticizing the media coverage monday			1
the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) launched a stinging response to allegations of wrongdoing following its general assembly , which was held in @entity64 , @entity65 ahead of the @entity66 , which gets under way in the city on thursday			2
@entity59 passed a resolution attacking " the repeated , deliberately hateful , defamatory and degrading attacks by some media , notably @entity52 , on the image and the integrity of the @entity59 , its president ( @entity74 ) , its members , its member associations and the entire @entity16 continent			1
" it went onto claim @entity16 football officials were being used as a " scapegoats " and thanked @entity57 for his " personal commitment to the fight against racism			1
" @entity57 was in similarly defiant mood at an @entity85 ( @entity85 ) meeting -- also in @entity64 -- despite many of @entity6 's corporate partners , such as electronics giant @entity89 , calling for an investigation into corruption allegations			1
" we have seen what the @entity52 press has published , " said @entity57 , who has been @entity6 president since 1998			1
" i do n't know what the reasoning is behind this but we must maintain unity			0
" referring to the recent storm around @entity6 as " @entity101 , " @entity57 warned that his critics wanted " to destroy , not the game , but they want to destroy the institution			1
" the eyes of the world are on @entity65 ahead of it hosting the @entity66 for the second time in its history and the first time since 1950			0
a string of protests and demonstrations over the reported $ 11 billion spent on the tournament have dominated the build up to this @entity66			0
a strike by subway workers in @entity64 on monday caused chaos in the city which will host @entity65 's first match against @entity122			0
hosting football 's biggest tournament is often billed as an opportunity to regenerate a country by reinvesting the money generated into domestic projects			2
but @entity21 , who is famous for coining the term " @entity130 " to describe the rapidly - growing economies of @entity65 , @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 in 2001 , questions whether the tournament will benefit @entity65			2
" there 's not a huge amount of evidence that hosting a @entity66 , particularly once it starts , benefits a country , " explained @entity21 , who is honorary professor of economics at the @entity138			2
" in principle , the build - up , with the infrastructure spending , has helped some countries , but the effects are very hard to see			0
if anything , there is a bit more evidence that the opposite happens , that countries get a bit carried away and they spend more than they can really afford			0
" once the party is over , it fizzles out			0
if i was @entity65 , particularly given the slowdown they 've had in the past couple of years , i would n't wanted to be resting my hopes for the future on hosting the @entity66			0
