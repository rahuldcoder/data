-- @entity1 has passed , and you 've finally finished cleaning the last of that weird basket - lining " grass " from the carpet			0
beginning sunday , millions of @entity5 can also celebrate the resurrection of their foregone vices -- whatever treat or habit they gave up for 40 long days of @entity10			0
after chocolate and fried foods ( pound - droppage is a common additional motive ) , an increasingly popular thing to give up for @entity10 is @entity16 -- anecdotally , at least			1
two of our friends tried it this year , and they both reported the break made them pretty darn happy			0
collectively , @entity16 's users spend -- wait for it -- 700 billion minutes per month on the site , according to company stats			1
assuming the site has 500 million active users ( they 've hit 600 million but have n't updated the time - use stats on their site , so we 're working with what we got -- thanks , @entity33 ) , that works out to 23 hours and 20 minutes per person a month -- on average			1
an entire day , shoom , out the window , into the sunshine that you are not enjoying because you are clicking , zombie - like , through pictures of that chick from grade school looking sweaty in a maternity suite			0
now , the debate rages on : passionate pundits on either end of the arena argue that @entity16 is bringing us closer together , or , alternatively , turning us all into socially inept hermits who smell of @entity50 and squint like little voles			1
but while we ca n't stop the churning tides of new technology , we can decide exactly how much time to devote to staring at glowing screens			1
and we 'd like to recommend that , at least for a few weeks , you make that screen - time shrink			0
with the tulips blazing , the birds singing and the spring breeze losing its chill , now just might be the time to take a break , or at least to set some self - limits ( to go from " in a relationship " to " it 's complicated " with the ol ' @entity16 , if you will			1
) here 's the shocking truth : if you stop using @entity16 so often , you wo n't need it so much			1
see , the whole " @entity16 addict " trope is n't too far from reality : recent research in the @entity73 suggests that browsing the site is self - reinforcing			1
frequent use paradoxically can make us feel disconnected , which we then try to cure by using @entity16 even more			1
in other words , the more you have it , the more you want it			0
( file that under " ways @entity16 is like money and sex			2
" ) the upshot -- and this is what my @entity16 - eschewing friends reported -- is that after a few days away from the site , you kinda forget to miss it			1
one said that she 's now back on the site but using it only to check specific things , instead of burning up hours clicking through 483 wedding photos of that dude from high school whose name she otherwise would n't remember			1
research backs her up : people are happier when they 're checking up on @entity16 friends vs. clicking around without a target , according to a study from the @entity106			2
just , uh , do n't let that target be a former flame and his or her adorable new significant other			2
( hey , another perk of less @entity16 face - time : lower odds of spotting infuriating updates from exes , rivals and frenemies			2
) now , if you 're thinking about closing your profile down for a spell , know that it will be warm and waiting for you when you want to come back			0
to temporarily hit the " off " button , click on @entity123 , then deactivate			1
to reactivate the whole thing a week or month down the line , just log in as usual			0
i hear the protestation , high - pitched and keening : if i 'm not on @entity129 , how will i get inviiited to stuuuff ? but recall that one can share events with nonusers by simply typing in their e-mail address under " select guests to @entity135			0
" remind your bffs that you 're @entity16 - free and the good ones , at least , will know to pop you onto the invite list to their next @entity141 - inspired gallery opening / speed hair - cutting contest			2
what you will miss is another mass invite to that random guy 's seventh pathetic open mic performance , during which he 'll try a new ending on his jam , " my burning heart must be extinguished			0
" somehow , i think you 'll survive			0
now , admittedly , pulling the @entity16 plug is not for everyone			2
to put it on the brown - out back - up generator instead , limit your time on the site			0
minutes please automatically pops you out of a given site after an allotted time			2
and browser - specific plug - ins can help you keep track of your site usage -- just @entity162 " [ your browser ] track time on websites			0
" by our math , the average user is logging a little more than 45 minutes on @entity16 a day			1
cut that to 15 and poof ! like magic , 3.5 hours emerge each week to enjoy the spring -- to play on a playground , soak up the sunshine and run around on the ( real , not blue - ish shredded plastic ) grass .			0
