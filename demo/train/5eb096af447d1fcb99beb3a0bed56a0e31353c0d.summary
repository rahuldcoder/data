-- from a country which brought the world brands like @entity4 and @entity5 , there 's another name that 's crept quietly to global prominence			1
@entity8 , the moon - faced cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth			1
@entity15 , ceo of @entity16 , famous for its @entity8 brand , speaks in @entity18			1
she 's one of 450 characters developed by @entity22 's @entity21 , but she 's by far most popular -- the embodiment of what 's known in @entity22 as @entity24 , or the culture of cute			1
her image adorns some 50,000 objects , from cute , of course , to downright crazy			2
but there 's nothing cute about the numbers			1
@entity8 is responsible for more than half of @entity16 's billion dollar annual turnover			1
her creator and founder of @entity16 is the effervescent 79 - year - old @entity15			1
he told @entity18 's @entity37 what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon			1
@entity15 : selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business			1
but i thought , goods that i want are also something other people want			2
so we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift			2
the idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide			2
in addition , to give @entity8 goods as a present is very thoughtful			1
our three concepts of friendship , cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people			2
it conveys the importance of being friendly			2
such gestures are necessary for the @entity22 nation			2
you care about other people by sending some gifts			2
those concepts have been accepted worldwide			2
@entity37 : my first question to you is @entity16 has developed something like 450 characters			1
why it is @entity8 has stood out so much more than the others ? what is the secret of its success ? @entity15 : at first we were using characters which were created by outsiders , such as cartoonists or artists , but in this case we had to pay the royalty			1
so we decided to create our own characters			2
we hired many artists and asked them to create various characters			2
according to our own research , the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear			1
@entity98 already existed as a dog character -- that 's why we went for the second most popular character			1
we asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat			1
@entity37 : let me just ask you a question about your life , growing up			1
reading your autobiography , you lost your mother when you were 13 years old			2
you went to live with your auntie			0
and you describe your life ; your childhood , has been a quite lonely			0
how do you think that has shaped you in your business life ? @entity15 : i felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything ; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life			1
then i asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people			0
that is not just to avoid behaving , which makes people uncomfortable			0
but do something , which makes people happy			0
in this way people can make friends			0
for example , when people are ill , you can say something to them , or when people did something for you , you say thank you to them			0
for those kinds of occasions , you send a small present rather than an expensive gift			0
it is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way			0
this idea has formed as a business			0
as a result , @entity8 was created			1
@entity8 has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends			1
i am pleased with this phenomenon			0
@entity37 : what , in your business career , is the most important lesson you think you 've learnt ? @entity15 : a good company means that , first of all , its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year			1
this is what people call a quality company			0
but this is not my main concern			0
obviously , a company should n't lose money			0
a company can not contribute to a society easily			0
but for me , it is important to establish a company , which has a good reputation			0
@entity37 : much easier said than done , how do you remain true to your original ideas , though , because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits ? @entity15 : the company shareholders actually say " make more profits or dividends			1
" but what i always say to them at the general assembly is that the shareholder should be someone who truly values my company and is proud of having my company 's share			1
according to newspapers , there are companies which make a profit by polluting the environment or breaking laws			0
but this is not acceptable by our standard			0
i bet the company staffs want to have an increase in the wages			0
but i want my staffs to be proud of themselves , in particular , when their children ask them where they are working			0
in my view , that is very important			0
@entity37 : what advice would you give to someone starting out their own company in 21st century ? @entity15 : it is not only about making profits or establishing a huge corporation			1
a bigger country does n't mean a better country			0
having a larger military capacity does n't mean a better thing			0
it will be ideal to establish a company which is a value to the world			0
it 's not just about the money			1
so i would say " how about creating companies which people appreciate ? " e-mail to a friend			0
