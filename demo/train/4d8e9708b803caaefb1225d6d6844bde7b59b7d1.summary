to the outside world , they 're a force of ruthless yet mysterious insurgents bent on terrorizing civilians and expanding @entity6 rule			2
but as one former @entity9 fighter tells @entity10 , the mentality goes much deeper			1
" the main and principal goal of the @entity15 that they tell their new members is to establish an @entity18 state that will encompass the @entity20 world , " the man said in @entity12			1
" and after that , we go to other countries			0
" just two weeks ago , the man was in @entity25 , the @entity9 stronghold in northern @entity26			1
like many cities across @entity26 and @entity28 , @entity25 has been overrun by @entity9 militants who show no mercy for those who do n't follow their hard line			1
crucifixions and public executions take place virtually every day			0
women not fully covered in niqabs are lashed with alarming frequency			0
even store owners who leave their shops open during times of prayer can get beaten or sent to prison			0
the former insurgent , in his 20s , left @entity9 two weeks ago because he said the group is " spreading injustice in the name of justice			1
" but he still agrees with the ideology of the group that is forcing its beliefs on everyday life , including in education			0
" @entity56 is prohibited ; they canceled it as a kind of blasphemy , " he said			0
" many subjects have been canceled , like music and even sometimes sports			0
all of them have been canceled from the school curriculum			0
" perhaps the only thing as disturbing as @entity9 ' terror rampage is the growing number of foreigners joining its ranks			1
thousands of foreign fighters are estimated to have joined @entity9			1
and the @entity73 militant said these foreigners could carry out attacks when they go home , but security measures in those countries could make it difficult -- at least for now			1
" since @entity80 fighters joined @entity9 , they consider their home country as infidels , " he said			1
" if they have a chance , they will carry out attacks			0
" the @entity87 is already on high alert , raising its terror threat level from " substantial " to " severe " on friday			0
prime minister @entity90 has proposed a radical new measure to ban @entity87 from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad			1
and the @entity94 got a harsh reminder of @entity9 ' reach when @entity97 , a 33 - year - old from the @entity99 , became the first known @entity94 to be killed while fighting for @entity9			2
@entity94 defense secretary @entity100 has called @entity9 " beyond just a terrorist group			1
" " they marry ideology , a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess , " he said last week			0
" this is beyond anything we have seen , and we must prepare for everything			0
" @entity9 may have wanted to show off its global reach by having a militant with a @entity87 accent front the videos of the beheadings of @entity94 journalists @entity115 and @entity117			2
and that kind of tactic could also inspire more foreigners , the former @entity9 fighter told @entity10			2
" it is possible that the goal was to project the image that a @entity125 , or a @entity80 person , executed an @entity94 so that they can showcase their @entity80 members and appeal to others outside @entity26 and make them feel that they belong to the same cause			2
" where do jihadis come from ? opinion : why we must all challenge @entity9 what is @entity137 ' heel ?			2

@entity9 plans to take over the @entity20 world and then " go to other countries , " an *ex-fighter* says
the man left the radical terror group two weeks ago
" since @entity80 fighters joined @entity9 , they consider their home country as infidels , " he says
