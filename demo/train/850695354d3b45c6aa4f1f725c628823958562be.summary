@entity0 , @entity1 -- on @entity5 this year @entity1 's new health and welfare minister came out with an idea on how to tackle the population issue : bring electricity to every @entity1 village so that people would watch television until late at night and therefore be too tired to make babies			1
could the remote control be a birth control method ? that statement raised eyebrows across this vast country -- but what are the realities and reactions from families who make up the second largest population in the world ? at 80 - plus years old @entity25 has never heard of population control			1
he lives in @entity1 's most populous state @entity0 and has certainly done his part in contributing to @entity1 's burgeoning population			1
" now you see i have 24 children , 13 boys and 11 girls , " @entity25 says			0
@entity25 believes only @entity33 can decide how many children you should have			0
he lifts his hands to the sky and says : " this is his command			0
it 's not my doing , it 's his doing			0
" on the other hand there 's the @entity44 family in the capital city of @entity46			0
" you ca n't even get enough water or electricity now			0
so its advisable that people have only two children and then they should stop having more kids			2
the @entity55 know a little something about population issues ; their daughter was given the official title of @entity1 's one billionth citizen when she was born in 2000			1
with family planning and free contraceptive programs the @entity1 government has long tried to encourage families to have only two children			1
overall government statistics show the birth rate is coming down			0
the numbers show 14 of @entity1 's 35 states have reached the two child per family target			1
but the push is failing in other states , especially in villages and among the poor and illiterate where the fertility rate is as high as 3.5 children per woman			0
there are all kinds of reasons -- from the desire to continue having children until a son is born to lack of access to contraceptives			0
the government 's concern is that a booming population will further test already scarce resources , greatly impact the environment , and make life even harder for the poor			1
according to the @entity94 , @entity1 is home to 50 percent of the world 's poor and on current projections , @entity1 will become the most populous country on earth sometime in the next 50 years , overtaking @entity99			1
upon hearing about the latest idea to use electricity and television to give people something else to do besides procreate , mom @entity44 scoffed			1
" that 's a stupid thing " she said in @entity108 then switched to @entity109 " the only way to change people 's mentality is through education			2
" but not everyone is writing the idea off			2
" it 's an idea that can really work			1
years ago @entity117 helped draft some of @entity1 's population stabilization policies and he now runs the @entity119 of @entity1			1
he says while education and access to health care is paramount , electrifying villages is not a bad idea			2
" it gives a message loud and clear that we need to do something for the people which is people - friendly and which in a way will keep their minds from taking irrational decisions about producing more babies , " @entity117 says			2
he says there are studies that prove it			0
one such survey done in 2006 by an @entity142 sexologist reveals couples with televisions in their bedrooms had sex half as much as those without it			2
that being said @entity25 , the man with 24 children had a different take			0
" after watching tv , " he says , " when we look at scintillating things we will probably want to make more children			0

an @entity1 idea to curb its population *growth* is raising eyebrows

population *expert* says the idea has some *merits*
but parents are not so sure the plan would work
