-- the lines are crisp , the roofline looks sleek , and the wide stance of the wheels gives the car a performance - oriented feeling			1
even though the @entity10 is a full - size car , the amount of passenger room still surprised us			1
if you were n't standing inside the @entity15 booth at the @entity16 , you 'd think you were looking a new luxury car -- probably an import -- not the all - new , full - size @entity10			1
no taurus in recent memory ever looked this good , and the transformation is welcomed because 2008 - 2009 @entity10 is n't a great looking car			1
knowing this truth , @entity15 decided to do something drastic			2
the all - new design is decidedly upscale			2
there 's not a hint of the dowdy old style to be found			2
the exterior style is dominated by a sculpted hood , pronounced front fenders , and character line that runs front to back ending at the tall trailing edge of the rear fenders			1
inside , a forward - leaning center control cluster clearly makes the new @entity10 a five - seater			1
new production techniques have yielded better looking and richer feeling dash and door coverings			0
as evidenced in recently introduced models , @entity15 knows how to craft high - quality and visually pleasing interiors			2
panel gaps and materials appear on par with luxury cars			0
@entity47 photo gallery even though the @entity10 is a full - size car , the amount of passenger room still surprised us			1
the adjective " huge " comes to mind			0
the trunk , thanks to the high profile of the rear fenders and the tall deck , is likewise enormous			0
back in the days of drive - in movies , it would have been easy to fit three stow - aways back there with room for soda and chips			0
the 2010 @entity10 should have the moves to match its trimmer more athletic looks			1
the mechanicals are based on the @entity70 , a capable performance sedan			0
the standard engine is a refined 3.5 - liter @entity73 ( also used in the @entity70 ) , generating an estimated 263 horsepower			0
along with earning @entity78 emissions certification front - wheel - drive @entity75 ( all - wheel drive is optional ) is expected to deliver unsurpassed highway fuel economy in the class , but @entity15 has n't yet released mpg estimates			1
every taurus will be equipped with a six - speed automatic			0
on @entity84 and limited models ( the @entity86 is the base model ) , the transmission will feature paddle shifters on the steering wheel , a manual shift mode , and rev - matching downshifts deliver a sportier driving experience			0
compared to the outgoing model , the chassis components under the @entity94 should provide sportier ride dynamics			0
@entity15 engineers promise more roll stiffness and more responsive steering			2
like the @entity70 , the new @entity15 uses struts up front and multi-link , fully - independent arrangement in the rear			1
@entity105 autos : @entity16 overview @entity15 added a healthy helping of technology to the @entity94			2
many of these features were once found exclusively in high - end luxury cars , but now @entity15 is making them mainstream			1
the list of options includes : adaptive cruise control that uses radar to adjust the car 's cruising speed in traffic ; keyless entry with push - button start ; and @entity15 's @entity121 with a new keypad flush - mounted on the driver 's side b - pillar			1
these are added to the latest version of @entity15 's @entity127 infotainment interface that includes turn - by - turn route guidance ( @entity127 and @entity130 's @entity129 are in a heated battle to out - feature the other )			1
@entity105 autos : full coverage of the @entity16 offering even more travel - type information is optional voice - activated nav with @entity137 that uses a large eight - inch touch screen			1
the @entity137 subscription provides current weather conditions ( real - time radar ) , a five - day forecast , local fuel pricing by cost per gallon as well as brand , sports scores and movie listings			2
one especially interesting option is what @entity15 is calling multi-contour front seats			2
these seats include six - way lumbar support and subtle rolling pattern massage			0
the minute but continuous movement stirs a change of muscular activation helping a driver avoid back pain and help reduce long - distance driving fatigue			0
we ca n't wait to log a few hundred miles sitting in these to see if they perform as promised			0
@entity105 autos : @entity163 on the safety front , the @entity94 is well equipped with standards including six air bags ( including two - row side canopy units ) , electronic stability control , @entity169 , traction control , automatic high beams , rain - sensing wipers , plus a post-crash feature that unlocks all doors , flashes the emergency flashers , and sounds the horn in an event of an airbag deployment			2
safety enhancing options include a collision warning system that 's part of the adaptive cruise control			0
when the potential for a collision is detected , the brakes are pre-charged for faster response , and a visual " heads - up " warning signal is flashed on the base of the windshield			0
@entity105 autos : @entity191 debuts drivers are also warned of traffic they might not see on the highway or in parking lots by @entity15 's @entity197 and @entity198 systems that use rear - and side - aiming radar			1
additionally , @entity15 's @entity127 now includes a @entity202 enhancement that will place a call to a local emergency operator in the event of an air bag deployment incident			1
regardless of your take on the old @entity10 , this 2010 edition looks to offer a level of technology and style never before offered for only $ 25,995			1
expect to see it in dealers this summer			0
we 'll bring you a full drive report as soon as test cars become available			0
