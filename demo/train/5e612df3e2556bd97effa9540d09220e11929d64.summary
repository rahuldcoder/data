-- when five - year - old @entity2 starts primary school in @entity4 next year , she wo n't endure strict discipline and mountains of homework			2
unlike the school life of most children in @entity10 , her days will be filled with art , music and creative learning at a private @entity15 school			1
@entity2 is part of a fast - growing number of @entity10 children whose parents are turning their backs on the state - run education system , which is based on rote learning and limited critical thinking			1
instead , they are choosing independently - run schools that use the @entity15 , @entity27 , or @entity29 pedagogies			1
despite a lack of regulation over these schools , parents prefer the humanistic approach of these classrooms and the perceived softer learning environment			1
" compared with studying under the public system , my daughter will get a healthier education and life here , " says @entity2 's mother , @entity37 , when we met at the @entity39 is attending in the southeastern city of @entity4			1
as we tour the school , headmaster @entity45 , casually dressed in a tweed jacket and sneakers , playfully grabs one of the students by the waist and spins her in the air , making other kids scream with laughter			0
at a state - run school , a similar scene of student - teacher bonding would be next to unthinkable			1
global attention @entity10 has undeniably gained the world 's attention for outstanding academic performance			1
@entity63 's 15 - year olds lead in mathematics , science and reading , as seen in the 2013 @entity68 survey by the @entity69 , rating the performance of children across 65 regions			1
urban @entity10 families are particularly invested in their children 's education			1
@entity76 , a lecturer at @entity78 's @entity77 , points out in a research paper that these families spend more than 30 % of their household income on their children 's education , compared to 2 % in the @entity78			1
but the " tiger mom , wolf dad " approach to education is not without consequence			2
@entity10 youth suffer higher levels of depression and lower self - esteem than their peers elsewhere			1
last autumn , a 10 - year - old boy in the city of @entity96 reportedly jumped 30 floors to his death after failing to write a 1,000 - word letter of self - criticism demanded by his teacher			2
perhaps in reaction to this phenomenon , @entity10 has seen a major expansion of alternative teaching establishments			1
these schools emphasize a holistic approach to education and use qualitative assessment methods , especially for kindergarten and primary school students			1
while there are no official figures for the current number of alternative schools in @entity10 , headmaster @entity45 estimates that some 40 schools and as many as 500 kindergartens operate across the country			1
his own primary school and three kindergartens in @entity4 have about 300 students , each paying @entity124 , 000 ( us $ 6,500 ) a year , with 300 more queuing to get in			0
education for the whole family for @entity37 and her husband , their choice of school is about much more than their daughter 's education			1
the @entity15 philosophy can be embraced by the whole family			2
with a focus on developing free - thinking and morally responsible individuals , the humanistic @entity15 concepts offer a sense of relief from the purely materialistic lifestyle that many of the country 's new middle class have been caught up in			1
two years ago , @entity37 attended a @entity15 workshop where she met @entity45			0
she recalls becoming immediately captivated by the philosophy			0
" it was like a calling , like realizing your destiny , " @entity37 says			0
" @entity15 became the start of a more relaxed and happier life			0
" one of the first things the family did was to get rid of their television and computer games , which immediately opened up plenty of time for " real life and real play , " says @entity37			2
they are far from alone			0
some 40 families have moved to the area where the school is , creating a community for like - minded people			2
many parents volunteer for the school , which regularly hosts workshops on @entity15 and related topics , often featuring experts from abroad			2
@entity45 studied the @entity15 pedagogy in 2007 , after which he left his nine - year career as a photographer to open his first kindergarten			0
he observes that many parents come to his school with a desire to change their lives , but not knowing how			0
" i speak to parents who do n't know how to play with their children anymore			2
they just put them in front of the television screen , " he says			0
" often the father is working so much and comes home so late at night that the child hardly knows they live in the same apartment			0
after coming to our school they learn good ways to be with their children			0
they get more quality out of life			0
@entity15 is a therapeutic form of education that can help the whole family			2
" doubts over authenticity some say , however , that alternative schools are proliferating out of control			1
there are few regulations around the growth of these private schools			0
the @entity213 - based @entity212 and the @entity214 both offer online courses for those interested in starting a school			0
teacher education programs are also available involving at least one year of study			0
however , as the demand for these schools go up in @entity10 , some are hastily opened without a full understanding of the philosophy behind the brands			1
@entity226 , the director of the montessori education program at @entity228 in the @entity213 , sees the number of @entity27 schools explode in @entity10 , but doubts that there are enough qualified teachers to fill the new classrooms			1
" i 've been to so - called @entity27 preschools where there was not a trace of @entity27 material , " says @entity226			0
" instead , they had a big flat screen television in the middle of the room , something that goes totally against our beliefs			0
there 's no way to train enough teachers for all those new schools			2
a lot of money is being made from these franchises but the parents are not getting what they pay for			0
" the same situation can be seen at other private schools , including @entity256 , according to several teachers and parents in @entity4 and @entity259 that we spoke with			2
despite the growing interest in alternative education forms , most @entity10 parents are still reluctant to hop on the bandwagon			1
the biggest fear is that opting out of the state - run system will lower their child 's chances at passing the notorious " gaokao , " the national college entrance exam that determines which @entity10 university a student will enter			1
@entity274 , professor of @entity276 language at @entity277 and a member of the state @entity276 curriculum standard team , is far from convinced by alternative education			1
less homework , he argues , is not the path to future success			0
" many parents think that you should not let the child lose at the starting line , " he says , referring to a popular proverb			0
all this seems far removed from @entity2 who is happily playing on the swings in the school playground , unconcerned about future exams and career prospects			0
instead , she is putting all her energy into being just a child .			0

@entity10 parents seeking alternatives to rote learning in state - run schools for their young children
holistic education philosophies affect not only the student , but the student 's family lifestyle as well
lack of regulation over new alternative schools may become a *problem*
