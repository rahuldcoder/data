-- it 's been impossible to go online or turn on a tv monday without seeing all the breathless chatter about the " doomsday " for the @entity5 , when hundreds of thousands of people were expected to abruptly lose their connection to the world 's computer brain			1
but what caused the " malware monday " panic , and is it really warranted ? here 's a quick - and - dirty guide to what 's going on : is my computer affected ? before we actually get into what 's happening , go to this site : http://www.dns-ok.us /			2
it will tell you , with near certainty , whether your computer ( or smartphone or whatever ) has been compromised by the @entity29 malware , which is the thing everyone 's talking about			1
@entity32 : how has the @entity5 changed your life ? how did all of this start ? in november , the @entity35 charged seven people in connection with a " massive and sophisticated internet fraud scheme " called @entity39			1
that scam tampered with the way computers access the web by sending internet traffic to websites that people did n't intend to visit			2
the group made money -- $ 14 million , according to the @entity35 -- off of fraudulent advertisements on those websites			0
the @entity35 eventually shut down the computers that were used to reroute internet traffic			2
that move would have essentially cut access to the internet for those people who had the @entity29 malware on their systems			1
so , as a backup , the @entity35 turned on its own computers to make sure infected machines still would have internet access			2
so , what happened on monday ? on monday , the @entity35 turned off those backup computer servers			1
that means machines infected with the @entity29 malware -- or that have traces of that malicious computer program left on their computers -- no longer can access the internet as expected			1
how many people are affected ? about 211,000 machines -- only 42,000 of them in the @entity75 -- were infected monday , according to @entity76			0
maybe that sounds like a lot			0
but , at its peak , 4 million computers were " hijacked " by the malware , according to the @entity35			2
that 's 19 times the number of computers currently infected			0
" that 's a large number , but it 's a very small subset of the 1.6 billion pcs worldwide , of which an estimated 339 million are in the @entity75 , " @entity76 writes			0
education campaigns are thought to have accounted for the difference			0
@entity92 , @entity93 and the @entity75 government have created tools to help people notice if their machines have the @entity29 malware			1
what should you do if you 're infected ? go to this website and follow the steps listed ( assuming you can access it ) : http://www.dcwg.org/fix / or contact your internet service providers and seek help			0
tell them you believe that your computer has been infected with the @entity29 malware			1
to prevent future infections , it 's important to install updates to your machine			0
professionals also recommend anti-virus software that can detect infections .			0
