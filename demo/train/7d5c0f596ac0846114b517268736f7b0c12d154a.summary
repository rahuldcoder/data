sgt. @entity0 withstood fire deep in the mountains of @entity3 and was exposed to @entity4			0
he survived that grisly war , but now , four decades later , his wife believes his life was cut short by delays in care at the @entity10			1
on august 8 , 2012 , a pathology report found that a growth on @entity0 's neck was " concerning " for cancer			0
the recommendation : " total excision , " meaning surgical removal			0
but @entity0 's tumor was n't removed until october 22 , more than 2½ months later			0
ten months after that , @entity0 was dead			0
the @entity20 in @entity21 tells @entity22 that @entity0 's 75 - day wait to have the cancer taken out of his body " meets the standard of care " at the @entity10			1
that has a lot of people worried			0
" i really do n't think it 's appropriate that our vets have to wait for months , " said dr. @entity30 , who worked at three @entity10 medical centers and is now a cancer surgeon at @entity33			1
" that 's just the way the @entity10 works , and it 's sort of been this way for years			2
" in 2011 , @entity41 and his colleagues published the results from their study on wait times for eight common cancers at @entity10 medical centers			1
the researchers found that waits from cancer diagnosis to surgery were longer at @entity10 centers for all cancer types when compared with waits for the same cancers at community hospitals			1
for liver and colon cancers specifically , the @entity10 surgery wait times were more than twice as long			1
in a statement , the @entity10 told @entity22 , " no veteran should ever have to wait to receive the care they have earned through their service and sacrifice			1
we must work together to fix the unacceptable , systemic problems in accessing @entity10 healthcare			1
" @entity10 doctor : timeliness not at the top of my list for three years , @entity30 and his team shared their results with leaders at the @entity10			2
though many were outraged about the long waits , nothing seemed to change			0
" we clearly have n't seen any major initiatives , " @entity30 said			0
in october , one of @entity30 's colleagues at @entity33 wrote an e-mail directly to the head of oncology for the va nationwide			0
dr. @entity87 wrote back quickly , saying in part , " timeliness of care is of interest , but would not be at the top of my list			0
" @entity93 added that even if there are delays at the @entity10 , " it does not appear to result in worse survival " for veterans			2
in a statement to @entity22 , @entity93 wrote , " no veteran should have to wait for needed cancer care			2
it is not appropriate or acceptable for a veteran to wait for months for cancer surgery			1
i strongly believe that timeliness in the delivery of care is a top priority , which is why i 've been actively engaged in the improvement of @entity10 's quality and timeliness of care			2
" a @entity10 official said that what @entity93 meant in his e-mail to @entity30 's colleagues is that he did n't think the @entity33 research was the highest priority , and he questioned those researchers ' findings			1
the official added that in 2007 , the @entity10 established a quality improvement program called @entity123			2
the official said the program made " demonstrable improvement in quality metrics , including timeliness , " but declined to be specific about those improvements			0
@entity10 boss plans ' personal action ' this week in wait - list case a phone call for a dead man the question burning in @entity136 's mind is this : would her husband have lived if he 'd had his surgery earlier ? it 's almost impossible to answer			1
the @entity10 says it commissioned an independent review of cancer care that showed " in nearly all respects , the quality of @entity10 care equaled or exceeded that of non-va care			1
" but other studies have disagreed			0
one showed , for example , that the mortality rate at the va after pancreatic cancer surgery is 2½ times higher than the mortality rate at large academic health centers			1
the complication rate was 58 % higher among @entity10 patients			2
@entity0 , who still lives in @entity155 , @entity156 , knows she 'll never have an answer			0
but she sensed confusion at the @entity10 as her husband was treated for a rare sarcoma , a cancer that develops from soft tissues like fat , muscle and deep skin tissues			1
for example , the @entity10 sent him to an outside specialist for a surgery that turned out to be the wrong procedure for him , so he was sent back to the @entity10 , losing precious time			1
she remembers leaving desperate phone messages at the @entity10 that were never returned , although the @entity10 says that all calls were answered in a timely manner			2
@entity0 says the confusion continued even after her husband 's death			0
just a few months ago , the @entity10 called , asking to make an appointment for the veteran			2
she politely told them he was dead			0
" the lady said , ' i guess i really need to update my computer , ' " @entity0 remembered			0
" i said ' yes , you really do			0
' " @entity185 to tap former chief of @entity187 to clean up @entity10 ' corrosive culture , ' weak leadership cripple @entity10 , report says a fatal wait : veterans languish and die on a @entity20 's secret list			1

research finds cancer wait times at @entity10 centers are longer than at community hospitals
for liver and colon cancer , @entity10 surgery wait times were more than twice as long
@entity10 : " we must work together to fix the unacceptable , systemic problems "
