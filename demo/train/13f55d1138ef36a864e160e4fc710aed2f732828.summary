-- a proposed new "			0
@entity2 " internet domain name will provide a stronger brand identity than current little known country domains , while preventing registration revenues flowing abroad , say backers			1
@entity7 , a non-profit organization registered in @entity9 , is one of the groups vying to establish and operate the dot africa name space for businesses and individuals across the continent			1
the opportunity has arisen since the @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , the body which manages internet domain names , voted earlier this year to allow new varieties of top - level domains -- the suffix of an internet address			1
@entity17 will be accepting applications for new generic top - level domains , or @entity26 , between january and april next year , with successful applications expected to be operational by 2013			0
two other groups -- the @entity28 and the @entity29 -- have also expressed an interest in applying to operate "			1
@entity2 " , while the @entity32 has said it plans to endorse a group to apply for the rights to operate the domain on its behalf			1
the @entity37 also plans to apply to @entity17 to operate the "			2
@entity2 " domain , along with the @entity40 and @entity41 alternatives "			1
it is currently running an open tender process for technical organizations to operate the domains on its behalf , which will be included in the @entity37 's application to @entity17			2
@entity7 executive director @entity48 said that the suffixes for individual @entity51 countries -- country code top - level domains , or @entity54 -- had generally proven unpopular during the decade or so of their existence			1
research by her company suggested 80 % of @entity51 domain name registrants had opted for "			2
org " suffixes instead , which were price competitive , reliable to register and had wide recognition			2
by contrast , the @entity54 were little known , as they were " usually owned by governments , and governments are typically not very good at marketing , " she said			1
@entity67 , head of information society for the @entity37 , said the commission 's vision for the			0
africa domain went beyond the commercial			1
" it may well be a very good business in terms of money generating			0
if it may generate some revenue we can use for the development of @entity83 in @entity2 , then that is all very good , but that 's not my primary goal , " he said			1
" my primary goal is to ensure the identity of @entity2 , the image , the culture are well - maintained			1
africa domain represented all @entity51 in the same way as the @entity32 flag , and its dignity needed to be protected			1
" i would n't like to see '			0
@entity2 ' used for something pornographic , " he said			1
it should operate in the " interests of the community " , rather than the interests of individuals in the private sector			2
" this is for @entity2 , and @entity2 is 54 states			1
" @entity101 said that in campaigning to build support for @entity7 's proposal , the group had encountered a strong response from youth and from business for the notion of a pan-african online identity			1
more than 3,600 prospective registrants had expressed interest by " pre-registering " with @entity7			0
she said young developers involved in creating local content felt a stronger affinity with a potential "			0
@entity2 " suffix than to "			1
com " domains , while it also appealed to corporates , who would be able to unify their presence across the continent under a single online brand			2
@entity125 is the founder and ceo of @entity127 , a @entity128 - based micro-finance company			0
the company also operates in @entity130 and @entity131 , where it is looking to expand its operations , but currently uses a @entity128 " co.ke " suffix			0
" for companies looking to expand throughout @entity2 , it 's a good way of creating a brand identity , " he said of the potential domain			1
" what really appeals to us is expressing that @entity51 identity			2
sometimes you do n't really know where these companies are from			0
" @entity101 said that if her group was successful in its application to establish and operate the domain , it would look offer domains at prices competitive to "			2
com " registrations -- $ 5 for students , or between $ 9 to $ 19 for small - to medium - enterprises			0
a major benefit of the "			0
@entity2 " domain would be that proceeds from @entity51 domain registrations would remain on the continent , rather than flowing offshore			1
@entity7 says it plans to reinvest surpluses into developing the @entity51 internet sector			2
she said there was concern from governments that a "			0
@entity2 " domain could jeopardize the existing @entity54			1
" but i can assure you , if there is no '			0
africa ' , i do n't think there will be any more uptake of the @entity54 , " she said			1
however , not everyone is as optimistic about the potential impact of the new generic top - level domains			0
@entity175 , vice-president of web services for tech consultancy @entity177 , said that because the new wave of @entity26 went " against the grain of current consumer trends " , his company expected most of them to fall short of their goals			0
to be successful , the new @entity26 would require a change in consumer behavior , plus a change in how search engines index the internet			0
users would have to type unfamiliar text strings into the address bar of the their browser , at a time when consumers were increasingly relying on search engines and social media to navigate the internet			0
he said that given the $ 185,000 price tag to apply for the new @entity26 , most organizations would be better served by investing in creating faster , more usable sites that are more easily indexed by search engines , and broadening the social media presence of their organization			0
however , he did expect a handful of regional - based gtlds like "			0
@entity2 " to be successful , depending on how well they were operated and how consumers responded			2
@entity17 will not make a decision on control of the domain until after the application closes in april next year .			0

a number of groups are vying for the right to operate the " . africa " internet domain
there is strong demand for a pan-african online identity , says one
it says individual country suffixes , or @entity54 , have proven unpopular in @entity2
