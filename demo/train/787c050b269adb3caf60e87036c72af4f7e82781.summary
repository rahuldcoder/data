-- the @entity2 @entity1 on thursday revoked a permit for one of the nation 's largest mountaintop removal mining projects , saying it would destroy water , wildlife and @entity10 communities in @entity11			1
the controversial decision was condemned by the permit holder , @entity14 , and mining representatives , who said it would hurt industry investment and the economic recovery			1
but adversaries praised the ruling as " a major victory " for environmentalists opposed to surface -- or mountaintop - removal -- mining , which uses explosives on hilltops to expose underlying coal			1
the @entity1 invoked the @entity29 in killing a permit issued by the @entity31 for the @entity33 project , proposed for a more than 2,200 - acre area in @entity35 , @entity11			1
the agency has used that authority only 12 times since 1972			0
coal industry representatives suggested politics was behind the ruling			1
regulators under @entity44 president @entity43 , viewed as friendly to the coal industry , approved the permit , but agencies under @entity50 president @entity49 's administration moved to veto it , prompting lawsuits			2
one industry leader called the ruling " unprecedented			1
" the @entity55 called it a " historic step " in dealing with " this mother of all mountaintop removal coal mines			1
" a @entity11 mining historian , who opposes another hilltop mining project at a state historic site , said the decision could merely force the industry to deploy the more costly method of traditional shaft mining , instead of the cheaper mountaintop - removal technique			1
despite industry objections , the @entity1 insisted " coal and coal mining are part of our nation 's energy future , " one official said in a statement thursday			1
@entity77 - based @entity14 described the ruling as " chilling " to the industry and contended that the project would have infused the local economy with $ 250 million and 250 " well - paying " jobs			1
" we believe this decision will have a chilling effect on future @entity2 investment because every business possessing or requiring a permit under @entity91 of the @entity29 will fear similar overreaching by the @entity1 , " @entity14 spokeswoman @entity83 said in a statement			1
" it 's a risk many businesses can not afford to take			0
" we remain shocked and dismayed at @entity1 's continued onslaught with respect to this validly issued permit			1
" @entity14 will " vigorously " defend the permit , now in court , and assert its right to have a predictable regulatory environment , @entity83 said			0
in response , the @entity1 said that 100,000 projects are approved by the corps every year , translating to millions of permits during the 39 years of the @entity29			2
the @entity1 has only twice revoked a permit under the section cited by the coal firm and added in its statement that the large scale and nature of the @entity14 permit are issues " unlikely to be repeated for other permitted @entity10 surface coal mining projects			1
" " despite @entity1 's willingness to consider alternatives , the company did not offer any new proposed mining configurations in response to @entity1 's concerns based on science and the law , " the agency statement said			1
" we do n't think people in @entity11 have to make the false choice between healthy waters and a healthy economy			0
" the plaintiff who began the fight to stop the mine , 70 - year - old @entity133 , told @entity0 on thursday that he was elated at the decision			2
@entity133 sued the government in 1998 for issuing the permit , saying @entity137 , where he lives , would be obliterated by the mine			0
" they did the right thing , the @entity1 did			2
thank @entity143 for that , " @entity133 told @entity0 , whose news crew was interviewing him when he received word of the ruling			2
" this is another victory			0
they were fixing to destroy this , " he said , referring to his property in @entity150 , @entity11			0
" i hope it 's considered that all mountaintop removal permits will now stop , " he said			0
that hope is what triggers fear among industry leaders and the coal - mining families of @entity11			1
" it 's absolutely mind - boggling to grasp , " said @entity158 , 51 , of @entity159 , @entity11			0
her husband , @entity162 , 48 , is a surface miner , and his job is now in jeopardy , she said			0
the @entity166 are three - generation mining family			2
@entity169 ' father and grandfather were traditional underground miners , and @entity158 ' grandfather was a similar miner , she said			0
her family lives seven miles from the @entity33 project , she said			2
" this is just one permit			0
what 's going to stop them from taking back the rest of them , " @entity158 told @entity0			0
" right now , the thought that goes through your head is what job in coal mining is safe at this point , as far as your permits and stuff go			1
if they can take one , they can take them all			0
" @entity193 , president of the @entity194 , said he found the decision " absolutely awful news from an @entity2 standpoint and a mining standpoint			2
" " this is an example of arrogance on the part of the federal government , " @entity193 said			0
" this permit was issued with all agencies agreeing on it four years ago , including the @entity1			2
then today they come in and say we 're not going to have that permit			0
it 's like revoking a driver 's license after it 's issued			0
" @entity212 , president and ceo of the @entity214 at the @entity2 @entity215 , said the @entity1 decision " sends a very unsettling message to @entity2 businesses			1
" " @entity1 's unprecedented action to retroactively deny a permit changes the rules not just in the middle of the game , but at the end of it , " @entity212 said in a statement			2
" this is exactly the kind of practice that will keep capital on the sidelines and slow our economic recovery			0
the negative impact of this decision will be felt not only by @entity234 and the energy industry but across all sectors of our economy			2
" @entity239 , a history instructor at @entity240 in @entity35 , said the decision was " a major victory for environmentalists , " but " it 's not going to end coal mining , " as some might suggest			1
@entity247 mining is cheaper because it employs fewer miners , and the @entity1 decision may force the industry to deploy traditional underground methods , which are more labor - intensive , @entity239 said			1
" it 's going to affect profits because mountaintop removal is the cheapest way to get coal , " @entity239 told @entity0			0
a historian of @entity11 coal mining , he 's a member of @entity259 , which opposes any surface mining at the site of 15,000 - miner revolt in 1921 that included his great - grandfather , who was charged with treason , which was later dropped			1
" it 's very difficult to prophesize what will happen , " @entity239 said			0
" it depends on how the coal companies will react			0
will they be more conciliatory and willing to work with environmental groups or are they going to entrench themselves and draw battle lines ? " in its decision , the @entity1 acted under the law and used " the best science " in determining that the mine " would use destructive and unsustainable mining practices that jeopardize the health of @entity10 communities and clean water on which they depend , " @entity1 assistant administrator for @entity276 said in a statement			1
" coal and coal mining are part of our nation 's energy future , and @entity1 has worked with companies to design mining operations that adequately protect our nation 's waters , " @entity276 said			1
" we have a responsibility under the law to protect water quality and safeguard the people who rely on clean water			0
" the @entity1 said it believes that mining companies can design their operations to make them more sustainable and compliant with the law			2
the agency cited as an example a mining company it worked closely with last year to eliminate nearly 50 percent of its water impacts and reduce contamination while increasing coal production			1
in vetoing the permit , the agency said the mine would have created 110 million cubic yards of waste from blasting more than 2,200 acres of mountains and forests			1
the waste would have buried more than six miles of high - quality streams in @entity35 , killing fish , small invertebrates , salamanders and other wildlife , the agency said			0
the mining operation would have tainted downstream waters with toxic levels of selenium , which turn fresh water into salty water , the @entity1 said			2
the agency also said the mining plan " inadequately mitigated " environmental impacts by attempting to use storm water ditches as compensation for natural stream losses , the agency said			0
@entity0 's @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .			0

an angry industry leader calls the decision " unprecedented "
environmentalists call it a " historic step "
the @entity1 says the project would have created 110 million cubic yards of waste
a " shocked " coal mining company says the ruling will have a " chilling effect "
