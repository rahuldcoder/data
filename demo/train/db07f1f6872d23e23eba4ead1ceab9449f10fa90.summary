-- may 10 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hello , everyone ! this tuesday on @entity0 , we 're taking you under the big top			2
first , though , we 're headed down the mighty @entity4			1
first up : flood @entity20 @entity22 : that would be the @entity4 , which is causing floods up and down its path through the @entity27			1
want to take you down the river now to check out some of what 's been going on			1
we 're gon na start in southern @entity7 , in the city of @entity33			1
you see it right there on your screen			2
flooding was threatening to wipe out the entire town			1
the @entity40 came up with this plan to help @entity33 and some other communities nearby			2
and that brings us down into @entity45			2
what the @entity40 did was intentionally blow up a levee , a barrier that 's designed to actually prevent flooding			1
that helped the towns up in @entity7 , but it purposely flooded some parts of @entity45 , some farms			1
and a lot of people , especially farmers , angry with this plan			0
one farmer said she felt like she was suffering for somebody else			0
the flooding has followed the @entity4 's path through @entity63 and down into @entity64 , as you see here			1
yesterday , engineers opened a spillway north of the @entity68			0
the goal here is to help ease the pressure on the river , hopefully lower the flood levels , keep the water away from @entity68			0
but just to get an idea of how much water we 're talking about , a commander with the @entity40 offered an analogy			0
he said the water that 's rushing through the @entity4 right now , in one second , could fill up an area the size of a football field 44 feet deep			1
we 're also seeing flooding in states that the @entity4 branches off to , like @entity87			1
@entity88 has more on the situation there			0
( begin video ) @entity92 , @entity94 national correspondent : @entity87 's largest city is in the cross hairs			1
@entity97 now has the " most high - risk population " for flooding , according to the @entity40			1
on tuesday , authorities expect the @entity4 to crest at 48 feet outside the city , less than a foot shy of the record level set in 1937			1
with the @entity4 swollen by a month of abnormally high rainfall , its tributaries are overflowing , with nowhere for their water to flow			1
at least 1,100 homes and trailers in and around @entity97 have been evacuated			0
400 residents of @entity110 are currently in shelters			0
on sunday , officials went door to door to alert others that they may also need to leave their homes			1
the mayor of @entity97 is confident that all those who need to escape the rising waters will be evacuated			0
@entity120 @entity119 , @entity97 : we 'll get them out			0
some are holding out to the last minute , but we think in the end they 're going to come on out			0
@entity126 : officials say while there is great pressure on the levees around @entity97 , they are currently performing as expected			1
( @entity132 ) is this legit ? @entity133 , @entity15 : is this legit ? the @entity27 and @entity134 have the world 's largest economies			1
legit ! that means these countries have a lot of influence when it comes to global finances			0
economic talks @entity22 : well , the global economy is one of the big issues ahead as representatives from the @entity27 and @entity134 meet in @entity149 this week			0
this is the third set of meetings between the two governments			0
last week , one @entity134 economic official said , " to be frank , we have different views that make discussion necessary			0
" some of those different views have to do with the economic policies of the @entity27 and @entity134			0
since they 're the world 's biggest economies , what each country does -- its economic practices , the decisions it makes -- can have a pretty big impact on the other nation			1
some other subjects are likely to come up during the meetings			0
that includes human rights , concerns about @entity173 's nuclear program , and the @entity27 and @entity134 working together to fight terrorism			1
reactors @entity22 : moving to @entity5 , where officials are shutting down a nuclear power plant			1
not the @entity179 plant , the one we 've talked about since @entity5 's earthquake and tsunami in march			1
no , the one we 're talking about today is the @entity184 plant			1
the owner announced it 's being shut down after @entity5 's prime minister warned that @entity184 was vulnerable to natural disasters , like the ones that damaged the @entity179 plant			1
@entity184 's owner says safety is his company 's first priority			1
meanwhile , workers went back inside one of the reactors at the @entity179 plant yesterday			1
they were checking on a ventilation system that was installed last week			0
the system is filtering out radioactive substances so that engineers can go in and shut down the reactor			0
@entity203 @entity204 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to miss @entity207 ' class at the @entity208 in @entity209 , @entity210 ! what is the scientific name for a fear of heights ? here we go ! is it : a ) @entity219 , b ) @entity217 or @entity220 ) arachnophobia ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! fear of heights is acrophobia , from the root word acro , which means height			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity230 @entity22 : that 's also where we get the word acrobat , like tightrope walkers and trapeze artists ; the kind of folks you 'd see in a circus			1
@entity240 visited a school in @entity7 where students can train to be part of the show			1
it 's not clown college			1
it 's a regular university where the person sitting next to you in @entity250 could be double - majoring in @entity251			1
( begin video ) @entity253 : is our identity going to become more external than it has been internal ? @entity257 , @entity94 correspondent : @entity258 is a sophomore at @entity259			0
@entity253 : boys and girls , children of all ages			0
@entity264 : she is also a circus performer			1
@entity258 is part of @entity259 's @entity230 , a school - sponsored circus team that dates back to 1929			1
it 's the oldest of two college circus programs in the country ; the other is at @entity272			1
@entity273 , circus performer , illinois state university student : so , this is the basic way to get up into the lyric hoop			1
@entity264 : @entity258 was a gymnast in high school , but like most of her teammates had no circus experience			2
what do your parents think of all this ? @entity286 : my parents are really supportive			0
you know , the minute i joined the circus , they 're like , " what , you joined the circus ? " @entity293 , circus director , @entity259 : i think any one of us who has ever come through @entity230 has had that conversation with their parents where they 're trying to explain that it 's still a part of the university , but it 's something in addition to going to classes			1
@entity264 : @entity306 , a former student at @entity259 and circus performer , is now the director of the circus program			2
@entity309 : for the most part , we look for somebody who 's strong , hardworking and coachable			2
@entity264 : and does n't have a fear of heights ? @entity309 : that certainly helps			0
although , actually , we have a lot of people who seek us out because they want to overcome that			0
@entity264 : senior @entity320 , who broke her arm in a trapeze fall , says after graduating , she wants to join a professional circus			2
@entity325 , circus performer , illinois state university student : i 'm graduating with a degree in public relations			1
if i can do that with a circus company or somewhere in entertainment , i 'd love to do that			2
@entity264 : the circus team has about 75 members			2
they do n't compete , but they do perform every spring			0
dating back more than 80 years , @entity230 puts on a series of shows at the university			2
this was @entity258 's first performance			2
@entity286 : not in a million years did i think i 'd be in a circus			2
so , i am so happy that i did it , though			0
@entity264 : @entity240 , @entity94 , @entity6 , @entity7			1
( @entity132 ) blog report @entity22 : a school without grade levels : we talked about this last wednesday			0
you 're talking about it right now ! @entity354 starts us off : " it would help with discipline problems , but with everybody working at their own pace , some students wo n't get the push they need			2
" @entity361 is home schooled , but thinks students should n't be grouped by age but by knowledge			2
" some students in a class grouped by age may be behind or ahead and thus ignored			2
" @entity369 says it could be a good idea			0
" teachers wo n't have to worry about leaving students behind who struggle or giving students who are ahead lessons on what they already know			2
" from @entity380 : " a big part of school is the social part			0
all kids deserve to be with kids who are going through the same things			0
" @entity384 writes , " students who usually get caught behind will have a better chance to truly learn the material rather than sit in a class they do n't understand			1
" but @entity390 argues , " it could make kids feel like they are n't as smart as their classmates , which would degrade their work			0
some might get picked on because they are n't at the same level			0
" before we go @entity22 : before we go , we want to show you some baby pictures			0
@entity401 said they were gon na be human			0
this mini-me here is the newest addition to a safari park in @entity407			0
her name is @entity410 , and she 's a southern white rhinoceros			2
it 's usually not polite to talk about a lady 's weight , but @entity410 -- who 's less than two weeks old -- already weighs 50 pounds ! one thing 's for sure : she does not have a dry wit , or any kind of a sense of humor , really			2
goodbye @entity22 : you can go ahead and ask her			0
are you wry ? no , serious			0
@entity422 - no - cerus			0
it was n't our best pun , but will it be our last ? @entity427 - no , no it wo n't			0
