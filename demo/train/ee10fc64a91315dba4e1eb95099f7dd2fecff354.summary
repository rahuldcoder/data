editor 's note : @entity2 is the producer / director of " @entity4 : a story from the @entity6			1
" the documentary , which was broadcast in 2008 by @entity8 as part of its pov series , has been nominated for an emmy for research			2
for more information , see http://www.tracesofthetrade.org /			2
@entity2 , at @entity14 in @entity15 , says the @entity16 needs to reckon with the damage caused by slavery			1
( @entity19 ) -- the @entity20 voted to apologize for slavery on june 18			1
the @entity21 apologized last summer			1
the first family -- descendants of @entity24 , of enslaved @entity24 and of slave - holders -- visited a slave fort in @entity15			2
these were historic occasions , and they occasioned the kind of @entity30 that always accompany the subject of slavery and whether we still need to reckon with it			1
i believe we do need more reckoning , and a little more love and a little more logic would help that process			2
logic first : there 's this quasi-math problem in which things do n't add up			2
many african - americans naturally feel as if there is unfinished business from the past , while many @entity48 ( and others ) do n't think they should inherit burdens from a past not of their making			2
so there 's this generational equation to be worked out , and it will take big hearts , eager hearts , to do so			2
the calculation is a bit easier for me at first glance			2
i 'm the seventh - generation descendant of the worst slave traders in @entity16 history			2
i found out from my grandmother when she was 88 and i was 28 , a few years before she died			2
over three generations , from 1769 to 1820 , the @entity63 brought more @entity24 to the @entity65 than any other family			0
they conducted the trade from @entity68 , the " largest " slave trading state , contrary to what most of us would expect			0
it 's natural for me to feel a particular burden			0
i was n't the perpetrator , i did n't inherit money from the slave trade , but i gained so much through the accident of birth : material comfort , education , access , a sense of entitlement			0
a look at the other branches of my family tree makes it more complicated			0
i have ancestors who were here during slavery but , as far as i know , did n't own slaves , and i 'm also the descendant of @entity91 immigrants who came to work in factories in @entity93 in the late 1800s			1
what i 've learned is that this ancestry is not exempt either : slavery was not just a @entity97 but also a @entity99 institution			1
northerners , including the " middling " classes , owned slaves for over two centuries ; they dominated the slave trade ( which included ship - building , producing trade goods , regular folks buying shares in slave ships , etc. ) ; they fueled industrialization with slave - picked cotton			0
from workers to the wealthy , everyone was part of the slave - based economy , even if just as consumers			1
@entity96 benefited immigrant families , even after the @entity118			1
millions of @entity119 flocked to the " land of opportunity " for jobs in a booming economy built largely on unpaid labor			1
immigrants struggled when they arrived but then found routes to prosperity closed to african - americans for a century after slavery as a result of official and unofficial segregation			1
within two to three generations , my @entity91 ancestors were solidly middle - class , not because they worked harder than african - americans but because they were white			0
they worked hard , and the system worked for them : home loans , home values that rose in white neighborhoods and not in black ones , college loans , access to better - paid jobs ... it all added up			0
so i ca n't help but conclude that slavery was central to building this nation , paving the way for so many , at the expense of so many			1
it was a national institution , not a @entity97 fluke or a sin of the wealthy few			1
as white @entity16 today , we can be proud that we do n't have the prejudices of our forefathers , but we 've inherited various blind spots and head starts , and it takes more than a couple of generations post-civil rights and affirmative action to create the level playing field we extol			0
understanding this history makes me more committed to being part of the solution			0
now , the love song			0
we do n't usually talk about civic love			0
he thought it was an extension of the biblical call to love one 's neighbor as oneself			0
it was his definition of patriotism : a love of self that extended to love of fellow citizen , all of which created a national glue of commitment to the public good			1
it seems to be in short supply when the debate turns to black / white issues			0
if love sounds extreme , then how about real empathy , or maybe even tenderness ? my ancestors came to purchase human cargo at the same slave fort , @entity14 , that the @entity194 family visited last month in @entity15			1
when i was there , in those dungeons , empathy overcame me , and my personal feelings of defensiveness suddenly seemed so petty			1
it now feels really natural to want to express regret -- not an apology ( that 's for institutions ; @entity204 was right to step forward ) but deep regret and sadness about what happened , fellow citizen to fellow citizen			0
i try to imagine what it would be like if we went so far as to extend tenderness toward each other			0
we could actually all use more of it when we 're talking about race , racism and anything to do with slavery			1
instead , we are full of protestations , distrust , dismissiveness , resentments			0
for those of us who are white , what 's the resistance really about ? it may be , at core , that we do n't want to feel guilty or blamed or responsible for the outrage of slavery			1
but here 's the funny thing : while we white @entity16 are busy establishing our innocence , it turns out that many black @entity16 are not personally angry at us for slavery			1
many do want authentic acknowledgement of what happened , but not for the sake of guilt - tripping			0
i 've witnessed a generosity of spirit that i have been humbled by			0
meanwhile , many african - americans are upset about the disparate outcomes that persist and want to see everyone step up to address them			1
there are so many lingering " structural inequalities , " as president @entity194 put it -- ones without clear racist villains but that are embedded , like the fact that schools are funded with property taxes , so poor black neighborhoods , the legacy of earlier eras of discrimination , are not able to fund the quality schools that we say all our children deserve			1
from the wealth gap to the health gap to the education gap , let 's explore how the dots connect from the past to the present and commit to finding solutions that should be race - neutral at times and at other moments should be race - sensitive			0
i have this image of us all coming up shoulder to shoulder on the same team , as fellow citizens			0
not facing off against each other but looking the same way , facing the shared challenge : the legacy of this painful history			2
the past is not of our making , but it has shaped us indelibly , and we have the power to make things right , together , today			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
