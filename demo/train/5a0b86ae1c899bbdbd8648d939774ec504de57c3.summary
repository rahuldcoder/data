-- @entity4 relatives of a 9 - year - old boy , caught in an international custody battle with the child 's father , will not file any further appeals after the @entity4 @entity10 ruled against them , their attorney told @entity0 wednesday			1
the family is just looking for a peaceful handover of @entity13 to his father , attorney @entity15 said , and plan on starting dialogue to allow the transfer to happen immediately			1
the chief justice of the @entity4 @entity10 ruled tuesday in favor of @entity13 , who had been battling the family of the boy 's deceased mother for custody			1
the ruling by chief justice @entity25 will reunite @entity13 with his father			1
last week , a lower court unanimously upheld a decision ordering that @entity13 be returned to his father in @entity29			1
@entity13 arrived in @entity30 to reunite with his son , but one @entity10 justice issued a stay , ordering @entity13 to remain with his @entity4 relatives until the high court could consider the case			1
@entity38 ' decision lifted the stay			0
this week the @entity41 issued a passport to @entity13 , given to his father , so that he can travel back to the @entity43 , spokesman @entity40 said wednesday			1
" our embassy in @entity48 , our consulate in @entity30 , many people have been up through the night just to provide support to the @entity51 family , to maintain contact with the @entity4 government ... as we , hopefully , come to the end of this process and look forward to the reuniting of @entity13 with his father , @entity57 , " @entity40 said			1
the regional court decreed the boy must be handed over by 9 a.m. ( 6 a.m. et ) on thursday			1
" @entity13 is very sad because it is not and has never been his desire [ to return to the @entity43 ] , " his grandmother , @entity60 , told @entity0			1
" he got especially disappointed about not having the right to speak in his own country [ about ] what he wanted for himself ... they are sending the boy to the @entity43 without the right to defend himself			0
where is the @entity4 constitution ? " @entity60 was initially expected to appeal			0
but @entity15 said wednesday the family wants to act in the boy 's best interest , and he was meeting with an intermediary to arrange the handover			1
he said he would like @entity60 to meet with @entity13 so she can tell him what @entity13 likes to eat , what he enjoys doing and other details			0
asked whether she would accompany @entity13 on the flight to the @entity43 , @entity60 would only say @entity15 is negotiating what is best for the boy			2
upon hearing the family would file no further appeals , rep. @entity80 , @entity81 , said , " this is not good news			0
" the custody battle began in 2004 , when @entity13 's wife , @entity13 , took their then - 4 - year - old son from their home in @entity29 to @entity30 for what was to have been a two - week vacation			2
she never returned , instead remarrying there and retaining custody of @entity13			0
she died last year in childbirth			0
@entity51 has argued that as the sole surviving parent , he should be granted custody			0
the @entity60 family maintained it would traumatize @entity13 to remove him from what has been his home for five years			2
the custody battle garnered much media attention and spilled over into the political arena as well			0
@entity43 sen. @entity108 , @entity109 , had placed a hold on a trade bill that would have benefited @entity4 to the tune of $ 2.75 billion , but he lifted it after the court 's ruling , spokesman @entity107 told @entity0			2
the bill in question , which sailed through the @entity117 after the senator dropped the hold , provides export tariff relief to 130 countries , of which @entity4 would be the fifth largest recipient , @entity107 said			0
@entity108 's hold was designed to exert additional pressure on @entity4 authorities to abide by the court order to return @entity13 to his father , he said			1
@entity60 told @entity0 wednesday it was " very sad , a country that exchanges children for economic agreements			0
" while the chief justice was still studying the case , @entity4 attorney general @entity130 said the executive branch of @entity4 government sided with @entity51			2
" once we stop cooperating and start breaking our treaties and international obligations , @entity4 risks the chance of not having its own requests in the matters regarding international judicial help granted , based on the principle of international reciprocity , " @entity130 said monday			0
" not releasing the minor into the custody of his father could bring sanctions against @entity4 , " he added			2
" it could damage @entity4 's image before the international community			2
" @entity0 's @entity151 and @entity152 and journalist @entity153 contributed to this report .			0

boy 's @entity4 grandmother : he is " very sad " to leave , " disappointed " not to have a say
@entity160 must hand over @entity13 at 9 a.m. ( 6 a.m. et ) thursday
