it 's carnival season , that @entity1 period of collective frenzy that celebrates overindulgence and transgression before @entity5 ushers in a more sober time of prayer , penance and abstention in the weeks leading up to @entity12			2
but the roots of carnival are both older and newer than the @entity16 traditions that started in @entity17 and have spread with colonialism throughout much of the world			2
ancient @entity21 and @entity22 pagan rituals as well as the folklore , music and dance of colonized peoples have forged colorful expressions of each country 's respective history and cultures			2
creative disguises and parody are characteristic of carnival in many countries , which historically gave oppressed and marginalized groups the opportunity to subvert norms of class , race and gender			1
here are some of the most dazzling carnival celebrations around the world			1
@entity44 ( january 6 - march 4 ) as winter drags into march , the @entity44 will explode into a cacophony of color , music and dance			1
carnival started here january 6 , but it 's the weekend before @entity51 , or fat tuesday ( march 4 ) , that has become the biggest street party in the @entity53			1
contrary to reputation , carnival here is largely a family friendly affair , with the most authentic events taking place far from the rum - soaked , topless naughtiness of the @entity61			1
if you 're looking to experience the unique traditions of @entity44 ' carnival , you need to find the " krewes , " neighborhood social clubs that organize their own parades , complete with flashy floats and their own carnival king and queen			1
be sure to bring bags to catch the " throws " -- beads , stuffed animals and other trinkets that are tossed to the crowd			2
information about parade schedules , routes and other carnival events and history is available online , although routes are subject to change up until the day of the parade			2
@entity44 also illustrates the story of carnival throughout the @entity86 : groups that were initially excluded from the festivities , especially people of @entity91 descent , created their own parallel celebrations , which over time flourished and became fundamental features of carnival			1
in @entity44 , nothing demonstrates this history like the @entity97			1
distinct from the krewes , these " tribes , " or " gangs , " began appearing in late 19th century @entity44 , representing specific neighborhoods			1
in the old days , gangs would battle one another to assert territory			0
today , they battle for the title of " prettiest " big chief , the ceremonial leader of each tribe			0
the chief and his family work on his carnival costume throughout the year , constructing stunning suits of satin , beads , sequins and rhinestones and enormous plumed headdresses that shake and sway like some rare , exotic creature			1
other members of the tribe along with spectators march randomly through their neighborhood , where they may encounter other @entity97			1
they dance to the sounds of jazz , blues and the distinctive call - and - response that brings the sounds of @entity128 to the rich musical melting pot of @entity130			2
@entity97 do not march on specific city - sanctioned routes , so talk to locals and tourist information officials to find out where and when to see them			1
@entity136 @entity137 ( february 28 - march 4 ) carnival , or carnaval , in @entity137 tends to conjure images of glittering bikinis , body paint and huge plumed headdresses			1
but it actually had an elite , predominantly @entity17 character until the 20th century , when @entity91 and indigenous traditions -- in particular samba music -- began to play a central role in the celebrations			2
that shift helped made @entity137 's carnival the biggest , most spectacular one on the planet			0
the huge @entity154 is held at the massive @entity155 , an exhibition area designed by @entity157 architect @entity156			0
here you 'll see @entity137 's famous samba schools compete all night while spectators generate a powerful energy in the stands			0
as throughout the @entity166 , the heart and soul of @entity137 's carnival is in working class neighborhoods and favelas , the city 's mountainside slums , many of which have become considerably safer for tourists in recent years			1
each neighborhood has its own samba street bands and costumed participants , along with throngs of locals and tourists who dance along			0
www.rio-carnival.net / @entity181 , @entity182 ( february 15 - march 4 ) half a world away from @entity137 's dazzling sun - drenched street party , @entity181 offers possibly the world 's most romantic carnival destination			1
get ready to be transported back in time as ladies in renaissance - era gowns and men in ruffled coats and powdered wigs stroll through the city 's famous piazzas while gondoliers transport partygoers to elaborate feasts and masquerade balls			2
from mid-february until @entity200 ( march 4 ) , the city is a place of mystery and enchantment			1
the festivities begin with the @entity205 , featuring a woman in full carnival regalia who descends from a bell tower in @entity209			0
the square is the center of carnival action , with jugglers , acrobats and a variety of musicians			0
on @entity219 tuesday , known elsewhere as @entity218 , the celebration concludes with a costumed ball and fireworks in front of the @entity223			0
while some @entity225 and visitors may plunk down thousands for custom - made gowns and masks , you do n't have to break the bank			2
rent a costume , or fashion your own with a makeshift cape and a beautiful mask purchased from any cart along the canals			0
presto ! -- you 're part of the scene			0
@entity237 / @entity238 , @entity239 ( february 28 - march 4 ) the energy of @entity239 karneval is largely generated by people of all ages who gather in public spaces or bars to sing , dance and drink the days and nights away			1
but @entity238 's carnival is also famous for its parades -- in particular , audacious ( and at times lewd ) satirical floats depicting well - known politicians			1
@entity254 , the second to the last day of carnival , features the largest parade of the season			0
see bands , satirical floats and thousands of spectators in creative , colorful costumes depicting everything from animals to priests , nuns , clowns and devils			1
do n't miss the alternative carnival , which since the 1980s has become a fixture of the season			0
@entity271 a ghoulish costume and join the ghost parade , a tradition dating back to the @entity275			0
then , the night before @entity5 , celebrate the burning of the @entity277 , in which a straw figure is charged with all the sins committed during the year and then burned as onlookers sing in a collective purging			2

www.cologne.de/events/cologne-carnival @entity285 , @entity286 ( january 20 - early march ) @entity286 may be small , but its carnival is mighty , lasting 40 days			1
that 's longer than any carnival in the world			0
it starts with the selection of the carnival queen in january , followed by lavish parades			0
then begin the tablados -- stages across the city where carnival shows are held			0
one of the main events is the murga , groups of musicians that perform a form of street theater involving powerful , haunting choral song that incorporate clever parody and satire			0
neighborhood murga groups work throughout the year on themes , lyrics and beautiful costumes reminiscent of commedia dell'arte characters , complete with painted faces , colorful capes and lavish headgear			1
top groups compete in large theaters around @entity285 , but you can also catch fantastic performances at the tablados throughout the city , many of which cost little or nothing			0
@entity325 : a musical tale of two cities another must - see @entity286 carnival tradition is candombe , unique drumming rhythms developed by enslaved @entity91 and their descendants during @entity334 colonial rule			1
today , candombe is thriving , particularly in historically @entity336 - @entity286 neighborhoods like @entity337 and @entity338 where candombe schools hold llamadas , call - and - response drumming processions , in the streets			1

@entity347 ( march 3 and 4 ) officially , carnival in @entity349 's @entity347 is the two days before @entity5			1
unofficially , the city fills with the sounds of the steel pan -- calypso , limbo competitions and soca ( a popular fusion of calypso and traditional @entity359 instruments ) -- right after @entity360			0
carnival in these @entity363 islands reflects their multicultural heritage			0
people of @entity91 , @entity17 , @entity366 , @entity359 , @entity367 and @entity369 descent join in the festivities , but especially the african slaves and @entity359 indentured servants who were originally excluded from @entity61 plantation owners ' carnival celebrations have created their own traditions			2
the big party starts the weekend before @entity5 with steel band competitions and creative , often outlandishly costumed contestants vying to be the king and queen of carnival			0
revelers stay out into the wee hours of monday morning , eagerly awaiting the arrival of @entity385 at 4 a.m. in this predawn ritual , local folklore takes center stage as people dressed as devils , demons and monsters dance wildly through the streets to the rhythms of battling steel bands			2
for those with the stamina to party on , this gives way to " @entity399 , " in which vibrantly costumed revelers continue the dance party , jumping and gyrating to the soca music blasting from truck speakers			0
the celebrations and competitions last through tuesday , with thousands of lavishly costumed bands and their affiliated masqueraders competing in an enormous parade			2
