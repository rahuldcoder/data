@entity0 -- a day after @entity6 's lawyers complained he was suffering a " slow death " in a tiny jail cell , the doctor was moved to a slightly larger one , his lawyer said			1
lawyers for the doctor convicted in @entity13 's death warned the @entity14 in a letter wednesday that @entity6 was suffering possibly life - threatening and permanent injuries from almost a year in a 5 - foot - by - 7 - foot cell			1
authorities transferred @entity6 to a 8 - foot - by - 10 - foot cell of the @entity22 jail thursday , " but it 's not a good thing , " his lawyer @entity18 said			1
@entity6 was found guilty of causing @entity13 's death on june 25 , 2009 , by administering a deadly overdose of sedatives and the surgical anesthetic propofol in what he told police was an attempt to cure the singer 's insomnia			1
the new cell has a solid door with only a small window , unlike the old cell that was open with bars that @entity6 could prop his long legs on when he stretched , @entity18 said			1
" it 's like being stuck in a closet and he 's freaking out , " she said			1
" he is feeling really isolated			0
when @entity6 called his lawyer wednesday , " he basically said ' @entity18 , i 'm dying , save me , ' " @entity18 said			1
@entity18 , who is leading @entity6 's appeal of his involuntary manslaughter conviction , and @entity46 , one of his trial attorneys , will meet with jail officials soon			1
the meeting will focus on @entity6 's health problems they blame on his limited exercise and small cell , @entity18 said			1
" he needs exercise , " she said			0
" you 've got to get him out of that cell more than once a week			0
" the best solution , she said , would be for the sheriff to release @entity6 on monitored home confinement for the final year of his sentence			2
@entity6 was sentenced to the maximum of four years in prison for causing @entity13 's death , but @entity65 law requires him to serve just half of that behind bars			1
another law intended to relieve overcrowding in state prisons has @entity6 serving his time in the county jail , which @entity18 said was never designed for long term confinement			1
@entity18 and @entity46 signed a letter for sheriff @entity76 wednesday that they said was " notice of the life - threatening condition in which dr. @entity6 currently exists			2
" " correction of this intolerable situation is of extreme importance , " they wrote			0
@entity6 is held in a high - security section of the jail and isolated from the general prisoner population to protect him			2
" death or injury at the hands of another prisoner , however , is no worse than a slow death caused by a loss of circulation and atrophy resulting from inhumane confinement of a large man in a tiny space , " the lawyers ' letter said			0
@entity6 -- jailed since november 7 , 2011 , when he was convicted -- is 6 feet 5 inches tall , but until this week he was confined in a 5 - foot - by - 7 - foot cell , the letter said			1
" if one were to keep a dog in a space just a few inches larger than the dog 's length , for any extended period of time , contentions of animal cruelty possibly leading to prosecution would likely result , " it said			0
the sheriff 's office did not respond to @entity1 's calls for comment			0
his jail conditions " are the equivalent of a large individual flying coach in a middle seat for a period of a year , " @entity18 said			2
@entity6 was taken to a hospital sunday night for treatment of what his lawyer described as " marked venous stasis of his lower extremities " and " right shoulder pain and severe loss of motion			2
" his cell was so small that @entity6 has " no opportunity for physical movement throughout the day , " his lawyers wrote			2
" the only actual exercise that dr. @entity6 received occurs on most monday evenings when he is transferred in chains to an 8 - by - 8 cage on the roof of the facility			1
" @entity6 , in a phone call to a friend monday that was published wednesday by the celebrity news website @entity146 , complained that he feared his illness would be permanent			0
" i may never be able to wear a boot again , " he said			0
" the venous stasis gives rise to a high risk for deep vein thrombosis and / or migrating pulmonary embolism , " his lawyer wrote to the sheriff			0
" this condition may have developed to a chronic state which has become permanent and uncorrectable necessitating a lifetime of medication and treatment			0
" @entity6 's physical appearance has changed dramatically since he was taken into custody , his lawyer wrote			2
" a review of earlier booking photos and bio-statistics of dr. @entity6 , when compared to his current condition and appearance , would be shocking to persons not previously familiar with him , " they wrote			0
" to those who have known him for the last year or longer , the suffering that has obviously taken its toll on his health is unimaginable			0
" keeping a human in such conditions " would at the very least give rise to civil liability for negligent confinement resulting in a debilitating medical condition , " the letter said .			0
