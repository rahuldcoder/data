-- new mobile photo apps such as @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 represent the next generation of photo sharing -- where high quality photos are snapped and shared in seconds on your mobile device			1
@entity2 and @entity3 focus on the instantaneous point - and - share functionality of smart phones while providing users with filters to fancify and enhance photos and the tools to share them with the world			1
path makes the same bet that users will capture important moments in their lives on their mobile devices , but instead assumes that users prefer to share these intimate memories with just friends and family			1
each aims to capitalize on the convergence of key mobile and social networking trends with a closed - loop approach : users take , share and view photos entirely on their mobile device			1
some history the online photo sharing movement can be looked at in three distinct product cycles : photo - only sites , social networks and now mobile			1
in the early and mid 2000s there was a measurable boom in online photo sharing services			2
that boom brought us @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and dozens more			0
it also led to key acquisitions -- @entity54 purchased @entity47 , @entity53 bought @entity48 and @entity55 snatched up @entity49 -- and a widespread user interest in using the web to share photos			0
the trend was also fueled by the prevalence ( and falling prices ) of digital cameras			0
in the late 2000s , social networking has dramatically grown in popularity and photo sharing has become standard fare on @entity67 and @entity68			2
these two services alone served as a catalyst for the second photo sharing boom , which had a slightly narrowed focus on instantaneous sharing to friends and followers			2
as of july of this year , @entity68 now sees more than 100 million photo uploads every day			0
in 2008 , @entity77 kicked off the @entity67 photo sharing phenomena and dozens of copycats hurried to pile on in the hopes of a building tools for users to quickly share photos on @entity67			1
this instant photo sharing trend is still on - going and has mutated to include a vast array of services that have added support for posting to @entity67 and @entity68 , @entity89 and @entity90 included			2
now in 2010 , mobile photo sharing products from @entity92 , @entity2 and path represent the next boom in photo sharing			1
these startups are strategically focusing on mobile first and aiming to capitalize on both the ever - improving quality of smartphone cameras and users ' desire to snap and share with ease			0
the trend in action mobile phone cameras have been around for years , but until recently poor photo quality was a deterrent that prevented device owners from using their mobile phones as their primary cameras			1
that 's no longer the case			0
now there is a vast array of smartphones available capable of producing photos that are as good , if not better than , the many digital cameras			0
as a result , more and more users are opting to use their mobile device to capture , save and share stunning photo memories			1
the common belief is that mobile users want a friction - free way to capture and post photos , minus the clunkiness and time commitment usually required when transferring photos from mobile device to desktop to web			1
entrepreneurs and investors are just now starting to build or invest in mobile - only applications specifically designed with these users in mind			0
path , for instance , was generating buzz long before its launch thanks to the pedigree of its founders and its all - star cast of investors , including @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
it 's unclear how well its private approach to mobile photo sharing is catching on , but its existence suggests there may be other unexplored roads entrepreneurs can traverse to capitalize on mobile photos			1
@entity159 founder -- and former @entity161 creater -- @entity162 is making an educated bet that mobile photo sharing will become big business			2
the startup landed $ 5 million from investment firm @entity167 , which clearly shares the same vision			0
and then there 's @entity2 , the two month - old , hit @entity171 app that signed on more than 100,000 users in its first week and is now seeing two to three photo uploads per second			0
some predictions as more mobile device owners upgrade to smartphones -- and there 's still plenty of room for growth here -- and mobile cameras continue to improve in quality , more startups and businesses will form to cater to the modern conveniences that instant mobile sharing affords users			1
they will build for mobile first and web second , if at all			0
plus , since history tends to repeat itself , we can expect @entity53 and @entity54 to make acquisitions to stay competitive in the mobile frontier			0
of course , @entity68 -- particularly keen on improving its photos offering -- will also continue to make strategic acquisitions to maintain its place in the photo sharing market			2

apps such as @entity2 , @entity3 and path represent next generation of photo sharing
high quality photos can be snapped and shared in seconds on your mobile device
until recently poor photo quality was a deterrent of using mobile devices
