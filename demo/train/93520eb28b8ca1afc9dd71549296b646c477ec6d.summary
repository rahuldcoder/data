" at a time like that all you think about is riding as fast as you can			0
i 'm not happy , in the sense that , to me , fair play is very important			0
" the kind of thing that happened today is not something i like , it 's not my style and i hope my relationship with @entity4 will remain as good as before			2
" @entity50 's @entity4 , the runner - up to two - time champion @entity1 last year , was angered by what he saw as a lack of " fair play " and vowed to take " revenge " on his rival			1
" in the same situation i would not have taken advantage , " @entity4 said , @entity58 reported			2
" i 'm not the jury , but for sure those guys would n't get the fair play award from me today			0
" i 'm really disappointed			0
my stomach is full of anger , and i want to take my revenge			0
i will take my revenge in the coming days			0
" in a similar situation in 2003 , @entity68 's @entity67 was praised for his sportsmanship after he waited for @entity71 to recover from a collision with a spectator in the @entity74			0
@entity71 then surged forward to win the stage by 40 seconds en route to the fifth of his seven @entity7 victories			2
the 187.5 kilometer stage from @entity81 to @entity79 - the second of four stages in the @entity74 - was won by @entity32 champion @entity84 after a fine solo ride , finishing nearly three minutes ahead of the race favorites			2
