-- the underwater search for the missing @entity3 plane will effectively be put on hold this week , and may not resume until august at the very earliest , according to @entity6 's top transport safety official			1
the new timeline means that once @entity8 - 21 , the @entity10 underwater drone operated by a team on board the @entity13 , wraps up its work in a couple of days , it will be up to two months , if not longer , until new underwater vehicles are contracted and deployed in the hunt for @entity18			1
according to @entity21 , chief commissioner of the @entity22 , the @entity20 government will post its request for tenders for the next phase of the search in the next week or so			2
" the aim would be to have to negotiate and agree to contract with a successful tender within two months of the release of the tender documentation , " @entity21 said			0
the @entity31 would not comment on what role his @entity33 and @entity34 counterparts have played in the process so far			0
@entity20 officials had previously suggested that new underwater assets could be in place in the southern @entity40 much earlier			0
air chief @entity41 , who heads up the umbrella organization coordinating the search for @entity18 , told @entity44 in early may that he hoped that new equipment be starting its work in the search zone off @entity6 sometime in june			1
bluefin finishing up its search the current phase of the underwater search will officially wrap up on wednesday , when the @entity51 is expected to finish its last of more than 20 missions , some 1,600 kilometers off @entity6 , in waters than can exceed depths of 4,500 meters			1
@entity21 says the @entity22 expects that the @entity8 will have finished searching the areas around the four pings detected by the @entity57 on april 5 and april 8			1
the acoustic signals are believed to have been from at least one of @entity18 's black boxes , but to date , no trace of the missing @entity61 has been found			1
officials have publicly said they would prefer the next phase of the underwater search , which could take up to a year , to be led by a single private contractor who will operate several underwater assets in the search zone			1
appearing alongside @entity34 and @entity33 officials at a news conference in @entity72 on may 5 , @entity6 's deputy prime minister @entity69 said search coordinators were specifically looking at side - scan sonar equipment that would be towed by a ship			0
some towed sonar devices , such as the @entity79 's @entity78 , can transmit data to the surface in real - time			0
they also have the capability of scanning a larger area than the @entity8 , which has been limited to some 40 square kilometers during each mission			2
@entity6 has estimated that the next phase of the underwater search will cost some $ 60 million			2
the breakdown of who pays for what still has n't been made public , but @entity33 and @entity34 are both expected to make significant contributions			0
mapping the ocean floor meanwhile , the @entity34 survey ship , @entity92 , arrived in the search area on saturday and has started its bathymetric survey , or underwater mapping of the ocean floor , according to @entity6 's @entity97			2
the ship will work toward mapping some 60,000 square kilometers , roughly the area where authorities believe @entity18 may have gone down			2
the @entity22 says it will be joined by a contracted commercial survey vessel in early june			0
the data will be transferred once a week to @entity103 by another @entity34 ship , the @entity105 01 , and then flown to @entity72 for processing by @entity107 , a government agency			0
the @entity22 estimates it will take about three months to map the area in question			0
but search authorities are still considering the possibility that the @entity18 search area could shift or be further refined in coming weeks , as it has several times since the flight vanished more than 11 weeks ago			1
review of satellite data according to the @entity22 's @entity21 , the international group of experts continues to review satellite communications data from @entity119 to determine the most likely area where the @entity121 may have entered the water			1
@entity21 said he expects the team , which is now meeting via teleconference , wo n't finish their review for at least another two to three weeks			0
" it 's important for us to be sure that we have correctly defined the search area for this phase of the search , and it takes time to be sure , " he said			0
analysis of a series of " handshakes " between @entity18 and an @entity119 satellite combined with analysis of aircraft performance led search teams to their current location in the southern @entity40			1
family members of those on board the missing @entity3 flight have been pushing for the raw @entity119 satellite data to be made public , so that it can be subject to independent review			1
many do not believe authorities are searching in the correct place			0
@entity33 authorities have indicated they will make that data public on tuesday , along with an explanation of how the team of experts arrived at its conclusion			2
@entity33 's acting transport minister said monday he is still confident in the team 's analysis			0
@entity18 departed @entity159 for @entity160 early on the morning of march 8 , carrying 239 passengers and crew			1
on march 24 , @entity33 prime minister @entity163 announced that the flight had ended in the southern @entity40			0
