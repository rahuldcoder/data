@entity0 -- @entity2 , the former host of " @entity11 , " made an impassioned plea wednesday for an end to what he described as an ugly side of entertainment : the mistreatment of exotic and wild animals in traveling circuses			1
at a @entity13 news conference , @entity2 noted that traveling circuses rely heavily on animals that are trained to do tricks , which he said is accomplished with acts of cruelty			1
" how do they train them ? they have to dominate the animal , " @entity2 said			1
" how do they dominate the animal ? they beat it , with clubs , fists , black jacks , ax handles , golf clubs			2
they shock it with all sorts of electric devices			0
they use bull hooks on them they even deprive them of food and even water in order to make them do these tricks			0
" @entity2 , who is well known for promoting the cause of animal protection , is championing the @entity48			1
the bill , which would amend the existing @entity50 , has attracted bipartisan support			0
the bill would affect only traveling shows			0
it specifically exempts zoos , aquariums and research labs and rodeos			0
rep. @entity59 , @entity60 , said that although the issue is not the most pressing concern of the day for @entity63 , " how we treat animals is a reflection of our nation 's moral character			2
" dr. @entity69 of @entity70 lent his perspective from more than four decades of veterinary practice on the conditions of most , if not all , lions , tigers and elephants in traveling shows : " imagine living all of your life on a queen - size or king - size bed			0
" but the concerns are not confined to their housing			2
@entity83 , president of @entity70 , said there is sufficient documented evidence -- gained from workers planted in some traveling circuses -- that many of the animals suffer from violent training and severe punishment			2
@entity2 's celebrity co-host was actress @entity93 of " csi " and " @entity95 , " who echoed the call for setting up more permanent residences for circus animals , and taking them off the road			1
" our kids look to us for what is right and our kids look to us for what is fun			0
... if our kids knew how cruel and violent these events were , i think they 'd actually be very disappointed in us , for [ going ] to these places , " @entity93 said			1
a recent incident in @entity112 in which privately kept wild and exotic animals were released by their owner and ultimately killed by authorities , and a recent lawsuit against @entity117 alleging the exploitation of orcas , have drawn attention to the mistreatment of show animals			1
@entity2 and his fellow advocates say the public is attuned to the nature of the proposed legislation			1
similar measures have been passed in at least 20 countries , including @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132			0
and , according to the panel , more than a half - dozen countries are soon likely to follow suit			0
" it is time for the @entity63 to join this parade of nations that is doing the right thing , " @entity2 said .			2
