-- israelis looking to know when to take cover are turning to their smartphones to get real - time notifications after @entity5 fires rockets from @entity7			1
the @entity9 app co-created by @entity10 , an @entity1 software developer born in the @entity11 , has become increasingly popular as the conflict escalates			1
while the country 's @entity15 missile defense system intercepts most rockets , some do get through			0
as a live interview with @entity10 and @entity0 's @entity19 began wednesday , both phones -- one in @entity21 , the other in @entity23 -- sounded in real time as rockets were fired toward the @entity1 cities of @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity10 partnered with another @entity1 software developer , @entity30 , after the 2012 escalated conflict between @entity1 and @entity5			1
" we knew this would happen again , so we wanted to make sure we had an app ready to alert @entity1 for the next conflict , " @entity10 told @entity0			2
@entity9 receives notifications when rockets are being launched from @entity7 , and automatically sends out a push notification to users via the downloaded app. their phone will play an emergency tone and display the name of the targeted community			1
the free app is available on @entity46 and @entity48 devices			0
@entity10 works full time at a software development company , and tends to @entity9 in his free time			2
the servers are hosted for free by @entity52 , an @entity1 web hosting company , he says			0
for security reasons , the developers wo n't say how they get their notifications of rockets being launched			0
but they tell @entity0 the time delay is less than a second of when the audible sirens are sounded			0
at one point tuesday , a rocket was being launched every six minutes			0
life in @entity7 : search for safety , or wait for destiny once the app is downloaded , users can select which @entity1 cities for which they want to get alerts			1
most users select " all areas			0
" @entity1 officials and the @entity72 have publicly supported the app , and encourage people to download it			1
before the latest @entity7 operation , there were 60,000 @entity48 users and 80,000 @entity80 users , all in @entity1			1
today , @entity10 tells @entity0 , there are approximately 290,000 @entity48 users and 300,000 @entity80 users worldwide , based on information from @entity86 's @entity85 and @entity88 store			0
of the 300,000 @entity80 users , 250,000 are from @entity1 and 50,000 are in the @entity11 and other countries			2
the @entity48 app is n't available outside of @entity1 due to limited server space ; instead users with an @entity48 device wanting to receive updates can do so through the " @entity96 " app. trapped in war : ' this is tyranny ' @entity99 , an @entity1 native studying in the @entity11 , has family back in @entity1 , and keeps up with developments through the app. " i want to know when it hits close by where my parents live , " he says			1
" i know if it hits they wo n't be able to contact me immediately , so i want to be able to know to get in touch with them to make sure they 're ok			0
" @entity99 's family lives in the town of @entity112 , roughly 20 miles from the @entity1 - @entity7 border			1
his parents have approximately one minute to seek shelter once the alerts go off , he says			0
the time it takes for @entity1 's to seek shelter varies , based on how far they are from the @entity7 border			1
" it 's great to be able to know on the spot when the alarm goes off , " @entity99 tells @entity0			0
" in @entity1 , you might be in a closed room not near the sirens , so this new app allows you to know when something 's going on			2
although i 'm happy to be able to know when rockets fall , it 's really sad to know we need something like this			0
" racing toward danger : war - scarred @entity7 medical crews also in harm 's way follow @entity137 on @entity139 @ @entity140			2
