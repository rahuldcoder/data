-- @entity1 earned @entity2 a long - awaited title in the final seconds of last season , and his manager hopes that sunday 's stunning effort against @entity7 means the 2012 - 13 @entity9 crown is still a possibility			1
second - placed @entity2 came from behind to snatch a 2 - 2 draw , but still ended the weekend nine points behind rivals @entity13			1
@entity1 netted his ninth league goal this season with a superb piece of skill , beating @entity17 to a throughball and then chipping a delightful shot over the goalkeeper from out wide on the right			2
" two years ago @entity24 were nine points behind and when they went to play at @entity26 two games from the end they were only two points behind , " city manager @entity22 told reporters			1
" two games and the championship is reopened			2
i do n't think this is finished but probably now we have to win all the games but if not then 11 or 12 games			0
" last year we recovered eight points in six games so i do n't know why it ca n't happen this year			2
we have 15 games and @entity13 have to play in @entity42 and the @entity43 so the season is long -- three months -- and we are confident			1
" having let @entity45 move to @entity46 , @entity22 started with @entity1 and @entity47 up front , and it was the @entity50 who broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute with his 11th in the league			2
@entity47 was also involved in @entity7 's equalizer , as new signing @entity55 scored his fourth goal in six games despite an apparent foul by teammate @entity59 on the @entity2 striker			1
" the referee said to play on -- he said not to kick the ball out , " @entity55 revealed			0
" it is not our job to kick the ball out			0
if the referee says to kick it out we will do that , and if he says play on then we 'll play on			0
we played on and we scored			0
" @entity7 captain @entity69 put his side head with a stunning volley in the 73rd minute , but @entity1 -- whose injury - time goal against @entity73 in may ended @entity2 's 44 - year wait for a league title -- embarrassed @entity17 soon after to leave the visitors in seventh place			1
" @entity1 's finish for the second was unbelievable but from our perspective we are bitterly disappointed he was in that situation , " said @entity7 manager @entity78			1
" it was a mistake , everyone is clear on that , but i ca n't fault the players			0
" @entity87 closed to within a point of third - placed @entity24 with a 1 - 0 victory at 10 - man @entity90 on sunday thanks to @entity93 's 11th league goal this season			1
however , it was marred by an ankle injury to striker @entity97 , who will miss @entity99 's prestige midweek friendly against @entity100			0
ninth - placed @entity90 had @entity101 sent off for spitting just after halftime			2
" the game changed with the sending - off			0
i 'm absolutely disgusted with @entity101 's behavior , " said his manager @entity104 .			0

@entity22 says @entity109 title race is not over despite @entity2 's draw
@entity9 champions need equalizer from @entity1 at home to @entity7
the 2 - 2 result leaves @entity2 nine points behind @entity13 with 13 games to play
@entity93 puts @entity87 closer to third place with winner against 10 - man @entity90
