@entity0 -- while acknowledging the hard - hit black community and budding criticisms in its ranks , president @entity2 said in a speech saturday night to the @entity7 that he would n't give up -- and urged members of the black community to join him to jump - start the still - sluggish economy			1
" i expect all of you to march with me , and press on , " @entity2 said			1
" ... stop complaining , stop grumbling , stop crying			1
we are going to press on			0
we 've got work to do			1
" the unemployment rate among african - americans is 16.7 % , nearly double the national average , while 40 % of black children live in poverty			1
such facts have made fiscal reforms a priority for caucus members , some of whom -- most of them @entity25 -- have criticized @entity2 for not doing enough on the issue			1
they include rep. @entity27 , @entity28 , who at a caucus " jobs ' tour town hall " in @entity32 this month described the unemployment rate among blacks " unconscionable			2
" she said the strategy to fix it was unclear , adding that the caucus was " getting tired " of waiting for one			0
she questioned the president 's decision to focus on the @entity38 during a three - day jobs bus tour in august , stating that the 3 million who live in @entity41 -- and are mostly white -- are roughly equal in number to the african - americans who are out of work			1
she suggested that @entity2 's administration seemed more keen to focus on that politically important state than on the black community			1
" are the unemployed in the @entity56 - @entity56 community , including almost 45 % of its youth , as important as the people of @entity41 ? " she asked in the statement she released ahead of the president 's speech before a joint session of @entity52 in which he announced his jobs plan			1
in his speech saturday , @entity2 called the situation for many blacks " heartbreaking , and it 's frustrating			1
" but he also touted achievements of his administration -- such as on the earned income tax credit , anti-foreclosure programs and consumer financial protections -- for making a difference , while admitting more work lies ahead			2
" in these hard years , we have won a lot of fights ( and ) we 've done a lot of good , " he said			2
" but we 've got more work to do			2
" as to the criticism , the president said that " nobody feels the burden more than i do			2
" but in a rousing end to his speech , he said he knew addressing problems was n't going to be easy			0
one of the chief lessons from the civil rights movement is that " you ca n't stop " in the face of challenges , he said			2
" the future rewards those who press on , with patience and determination , " he said			0
" take off your bedroom slippers , put on your marching shoes			0
" @entity2 promoted his recently proposed @entity94 during his speech , as well as his tax reform efforts to pay for the bill in part by closing loopholes and effectively having some wealthier @entity100 pay more in taxes than they do currently			1
as he did in a nationally televised speech several weeks ago , the president repeatedly used the phrase " pass this jobs bill " in promoting its various measures -- including efforts to bolster small businesses , rebuild schools and bridges , and hire back teachers , firefighters and police			2
in an apparent swipe at @entity116 , he urged politicians to fight as hard " for ordinary folks as you do for all your contributors			0
" " we have to make sure that everyone in this country gets a fair shake , and a fair shot , and a chance to get ahead , " he said			0
@entity2 insisted that having " the folks who have benefited the most ... pay their fair share " in taxes must be part of any solution , adding , " this is all about fairness			1
" the president has proposed a $ 4,000 tax credit to employers for hiring long - term unemployed workers and higher credits to companies that hire veterans who have been unemployed for at least six months			0
he also wants to see unemployment insurance extended to prevent 5 million @entity100 from losing their benefits and stronger programs to help the long - term unemployed through counseling and job training			0
a number of caucus members -- including chairman rep. @entity149 of @entity150 and fellow @entity25 representatives like @entity152 of @entity153 and @entity154 of @entity155 -- released statements of support for the @entity94 after the president 's speech , as did other black leaders , such as @entity162 mayor @entity161			1
@entity163 also praised the plan in tv interviews after the speech , though she said she and other caucus members wished the plan was " even bigger " and that she hoped the kind of help proposed would get to the people who need it most			0
more than anything , some black caucus members have said that it is imperative that @entity2 not only propose a plan , but stick to it			1
some of the group 's staffers have said they hope the @entity181 learned from experiences in past bills , such as the @entity185 financial regulatory overhaul , an instance in which they claim the administration did not negotiate from a position of strength			0
one thing that the administration appears intent on doing is not ignoring black voters , which overwhelmingly supported him in his 2008 presidential bid			0
@entity2 recently met with black journalists and with the leaders of organizations that serve the community -- the @entity203 's @entity202 , the @entity205 's @entity204 and the rev. @entity206 from the @entity207			1
he also has taped an interview with @entity209 , set to air monday , in which he is expected to specifically address the " increase of unemployment among african - americans since taking office , the current economic crisis , the political landscape around the 2012 presidential election " among other issues , according to the network			0
at a panel this month with black media group @entity220 , one of the president 's top advisers , @entity224 , called the unemployment rate in the black community " unacceptably high " and said the president understood that " inaction is not an option			1
" in remarks to the panel , the president said 20 million @entity56 workers would benefit from his jobs bill proposal to cut the payroll tax in half , a measure he said would save the average family $ 1,500 a year			0
" it helps out - of - work @entity100 , including the 1.4 ( million ) @entity56 folks and their families who are out of work , by extending unemployment benefits to help support them and their families while they 're looking for work , " the president said			2
" and it also reforms the training programs that are available so that they can build real skills and connect to jobs			0
and that will particularly help the long - term unemployed			0

new : @entity2 stresses " fairness , " while admitting " we 've got more work to do "
" stop grumbling , stop crying , " the president advises
with the black *jobless* rate at 16.7 % in august , it 's major concern for officials
@entity2 has recently been meeting with black journalists , leaders
