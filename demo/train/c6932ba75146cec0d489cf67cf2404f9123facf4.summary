summer movies 2014 : 5 things we learned @entity15 says that as of the last week of august , summer ticket sales were down by 15 % in comparison with 2013			1
@entity15 reports that " nine films have topped $ 200 million on domestic charts so far this year , only seven of which were summer releases			2
" with four months left in the year , if 2014 plays out about even with the last two years , then we should see a final domestic tally that 's down by between $ 200 - 300 million , or around perhaps a 2 - 3 % decline from last year 's box office , " @entity24 writes for @entity15			2
" notice , that number looks much less severe than the 25 % figure for the summer , but then again that would also assume the next several months compare positively to the same period in 2013 and 2012			0
