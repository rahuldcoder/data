-- his name has been passed down for eight generations			1
it 's steeped in tradition and family pride			1
oh -- but he 's not the royal baby			1
he 's @entity9 , a database specialist from @entity11 , @entity12			2
@entity13 is used to laughs and incredulous looks when he mentions his name			2
but the random guy at a bar who sang his name to the tune of " i 'm @entity20 " stands out among the bad jokes			2
" it was funny for the first half - hour , and then the more he drank the louder he got , " said @entity13 , 38			2
despite the hecklers , @entity13 says he is proud of his name and the tradition it bears			1
" i feel a modicum of responsibility , the pressure of carrying on this torch that has been passed to me , and passing it onto another generation , " he said			1
tradition also played a large role in how prince @entity9 and @entity35 , named their son , @entity36			1
the royal baby shares a name with some impressive ancestors -- there have been six @entity41 , the most recent the current queen 's father			1
the @entity44 royal family tends to pick traditional names , usually referencing monarchs of the past			1
it 's expected of royalty , but what 's the point of passing down a name when you 're an average @entity54 ? @entity55 or @entity56 ? parents are often tempted to name their child after a family member or a childhood friend because of the positive connotations they have with a name , says @entity64 psychology professor @entity63			1
but @entity63 , who has studied how people perceive names , argues it 's too personal of an approach			2
he tells parents to consider how an average person would respond to a name			2
he has crafted a system for rating a name 's attractiveness based on whether people perceive someone with that name to be caring , loyal , humorous , adventurous , successful or to have other traits			2
it 's all based on what impression a name makes before you meet a person , he says			2
take @entity55 , for example			0
it 's an " established name , " @entity63 said , but " there are names with a lot more positive connotations			0
" the name scores 36 on scale of one to 100			0
@entity56 , on the other hand , gets a 92			0
" maybe at some point he 'll be called @entity94 , " @entity63 surmised of the young prince			0
@entity95 and other royalty are typically bestowed with a long string of names			1
take his uncle , prince @entity99 , whose real name is prince @entity101			0
he does n't go by his given name			0
related : see the royal family tree cases like these are exactly why @entity63 reminds parents of the practical purpose of a name : it identifies a person			1
" it kind of defeats the most fundamental function of naming when you name the child after the father , grandfather and great - grandfather , " he said			0
when names cause confusion @entity9 goes by two names			0
he 's @entity121 at work and @entity123 to family and friends			1
he switches seamlessly between " personas , " but admits it can cause confusion for others			0
@entity13 's double name almost cost him a diploma			0
" because i had @entity9 on the books and i went by @entity123 , half of my high school credits were in each name			0
i almost could n't graduate because there were two records			0
" while that was a one - time mistake , @entity13 is frequently confused with his father , @entity139 it 's caused some issues over the years , like getting partly blended credit reports and receiving an @entity144 card when he was 31			0
but there are some perks , he says , like the time he used his father 's boarding pass so he could take his place at a wedding			0
bonus : no ticket cancellation fees ! despite the modern - day inconveniences of sharing a name , the father - son duo say that seeing the name repeated in the family tree helps them stay connected with the past			1
" every once in a while you might think about where you came from and we want to have a place to grab a glance at your past , " said @entity13 's dad , who goes by @entity162			0
" i feel that i need keep the name unblemished in honor of those who have carried it before me , " he said			0
the younger @entity13 is proud of his name and says he would like to continue the tradition			1
@entity176 : share photos of your child 's nursery " in an era of parents naming their children @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , i have to say that should i have a son of my own , i will undoubtedly campaign my future wife to bestow on him the mantle of @entity123 the 9th			1
" were you named after someone in your family ? share your story with @entity198 .			1
