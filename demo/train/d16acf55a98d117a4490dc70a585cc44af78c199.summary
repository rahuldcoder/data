@entity1 , @entity0 -- the running battle between @entity0 police and protesters outside the @entity6 in @entity1 continued for a fourth straight day friday , leading to scores more arrests and at least one death , according to state authorities			1
a demonstration in @entity12 -- which in early 2011 was the hub of activity in the revolution that led to the ouster of longtime president @entity17 -- was peaceful			0
but as it has since tuesday , unrest continued outside the @entity20 embassy as riot police clashed sporadically with protesters			1
one hundred forty - five protesters were arrested friday and 53 policemen were injured , seven by bird shot , said @entity27 spokesman @entity26			1
the @entity27 later issued a statement stating that one protester -- who was described as an ex-convict with an extensive criminal record -- was killed by birdshot			1
at least 15 protesters were injured friday from tear gas inhalation and eye irritation , said @entity37 spokesman @entity36			1
eleven protesters have been hospitalized in the past couple of days , he said			2
the tensions in @entity1 flared amid widespread rage over an anti-islam film made in the @entity20 and posted online			1
shortly after dawn on friday , officers carrying shields and batons and backed by an armored personnel carrier rushed a group of several hundred protesters to quell a violent demonstration that had raged through the night			0
after the rush , a smaller number of demonstrators regrouped near the @entity20 embassy across from police lines , and stones and tear - gas canisters once again crossed in the air			1
police fired rubber bullets at protesters			0
the army began constructing a wall of concrete blocks about 10 feet ( 3 meters ) high across the road leading to the embassy , located about 25 meters ( roughly 25 yards ) away			2
by friday afternoon , youths climbed the newly built wall and threw rocks at police , witnesses said			0
security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons to hold off the rioters			0
but 100 to 200 meters away , in @entity12 , a few thousand protesters congregated peacefully			0
more than 250 people have been injured and 40 arrested this week as riot police faced off against protesters , state media said			2
nearly three dozen of those hurt were members of the nation 's security forces , state media said			0
those arrested faced charges that included thuggery , assaulting police officers and vandalism near the embassy			0
both the police clampdown and the cancellation of nationwide protests come during a delicate period across the restive @entity97			0
in recent days , residents across the region and @entity100 have taken to the streets to protest the film			0
the region is on edge after the killings of @entity20 ambassador to @entity107 @entity106 and three other @entity20 officials at the @entity20 @entity109 in the @entity107 city of @entity111			2
ties between the @entity20 and @entity0 have cooled since the overthrow last year of @entity114 and the election of president @entity116 , the country 's first democratically elected leader			1
before he became president , he was a leader in the political arm of the @entity121 , the popular @entity122 movement			0
@entity20 president @entity123 said that relations with @entity0 will be shaped by how the country responds to the violence			1
" i do n't think that we would consider them an ally , but we do n't consider them an enemy , " @entity123 told @entity127 in an interview that aired thursday			2
if @entity0 takes actions that " indicate they 're not taking responsibilities , as all other countries do where we have embassies , i think that 's going to be a real big problem , " @entity123 said			2
@entity123 's comments were widely seen as a warning to @entity0 , which was considered a staunch @entity20 ally under @entity114 and remains a major recipient of @entity20 foreign aid			1
it is the most populous and one of the most influential nations in the @entity152 world			0
when the protests began tuesday , police and @entity0 troops formed defensive lines around the embassy to prevent demonstrators who had also gathered there from advancing , but not before the protesters had scaled the embassy fence and placed a black flag atop a ladder in the @entity20 compound			1
police arrested a handful of protesters at the time , but the failure of @entity0 authorities to take action sooner has been widely questioned , as has @entity116 's delayed condemnation of the attacks on @entity20 diplomatic missions			1
@entity116 initially focused his criticism on the @entity176 film as an unacceptable slap at @entity178			2
but after speaking with @entity123 , @entity116 on thursday directly criticized the violence			1
" those who are attacking the embassies do not represent any of us , " he said from @entity180 , @entity181 , where he was visiting the headquarters of the @entity183			0
@entity2 's @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 in @entity1 , and @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
