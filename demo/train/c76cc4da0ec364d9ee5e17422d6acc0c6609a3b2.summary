-- the @entity2 investigation made use of crowdsourcing to collect photos and video from cell phones and surveillance cameras at an unprecedented level			1
these pictures were made public a little more than 72 hours after the explosions and the second suspect was arrested 29 hours later			1
forensics is the use of scientific or technical information to answer questions in a court of law			2
digital forensics is the branch that focuses on the identification , acquisition and analysis of information found on digital devices : computers , cell phones , digital cameras or any computer - based system			2
the concept of law enforcement posting photos of wanted individuals in a public place and asking for assistance is hardly new ; walk into any post office and you will still see the @entity39 poster			1
why the post office ? because it used to be the social center of a town , a place where the government and the people regularly came together			2
fast forward to 2013 and we have thousands of people taking pictures and videos of what everyone expected to be an every day event			1
law enforcement agencies were able to use these images to observe the comings and goings of hundreds of people at a certain site at a certain time in order to detect a pattern of behavior with which to identify the two suspects			2
and most of this imagery came from private citizens			2
personal computers have been around for nearly 30 years			0
the @entity69 has been commercially available for 20 years			0
mobile phones have been pervasive for more than 10 years and smartphones , in particular , for more than five			0
computers , networks and cell phones have increasingly become the record keeper , instrument or target of criminal activity over the last few decades			1
smartphones are everywhere and offer the equivalent of a portable @entity69 terminal			0
not only do cell phones contain a phone book , call history and text messages , but also web browser history , email , @entity87 and other location information			0
and surprisingly high - quality pictures and video			1
all of this information will be of value to investigators			0
they will want to know who the suspects might have been communicating with in the immediate aftermath of the bombings and , again , in the aftermath of their pictures being posted in the media			1
the larger investigation will undoubtedly examine their text and email messages , social media postings , web sites visited and calls made over the last few months and years			1
this digital forensic evidence will help piece together patterns of behavior that could provide insights into the suspects ' thoughts and deeds , and even provide new leads			0
what does this mean for privacy rights ? consider that when a municipality wants to put up a new camera at an intersection , or purchase a drone , there is often a public outcry			1
is the camera an invasion of privacy ? where will it be looking ? how will the government use the data ? how long will the data be kept ? will it be used to track my movements ? at some level , these are good and important questions because this kind of discourse is necessary to frame our fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches			1
yet , in @entity143 , a lot of the images came not from public - sector cameras but from private - sector cameras : our fellow citizens			1
fellow citizens who voluntarily shared their information so that law enforcement could do its job			0
were these people violating the rights of others by sharing their pictures ? well , no , considering that the @entity155 was intended to protect us against a tyrannical government rather than from each other			1
indeed , it is not clear that the government could have compelled these citizens to turn over their pictures just in case they might be useful ; imagine persuading a judge to sign a search warrant on such pure speculation			2
yet , citizens stepped forward to offer their help , a clear sign of a community willing to work together for a greater good and one that does not distrust the government			1
although some might claim that these people were surrendering their rights for an element of security , it was the same instinct that made some people run toward the carnage so that they could provide assistance and comfort to friends , family and strangers			0
they were not surrendering their rights when they helped law enforcement but were empowering themselves as a community			2
the @entity188 @entity187 does not explicitly offer citizens a right of privacy , although many court decisions certainly support such an ideal			2
indeed , @entity188 @entity194 is well known for his observation , " the right to be left alone -- the most comprehensive of rights , and the right most valued by a free people			0
" your personal privacy has more to fear from the likes of @entity204 and @entity205 than from the government			2
commercial entities such as social media sites offer free services and yet make money			0
how ? we , our information , have become their commodity			0
they have more money , motivation and resources to use our collected information for their own purposes than the government does			0
we , as users of social media , self - exploit ; we post our information voluntarily			0
yet , once posted , we usually lose exclusive ownership of the information and always lose control over it			0
although the use of the crowdsourcing metaphor may be new as it applies to a criminal investigation , it is almost certain we will see more of this in the future			1
and it is sure to renew questions about how we all are invading each other 's privacy and personal space			1
it also points to the incredible resiliency of the @entity187 and its ability to guide us in a modern era , yet why it needs constant interpretation			0
as technologies evolve that the founders could not have possibly anticipated -- from fully automatic weapons and thermal imagers to satellites and digital technologies -- we have to figure out how to balance our rights as individuals and needs as a society			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			1

@entity257 : @entity143 bombing used public 's photos , videos at unprecedented rate
criminal cases will rely more on public as thousands take pictures and videos , he says
*unmindful* of privacy , he says , a community worked together for a greater good
@entity257 : crowdsourcing in criminal investigation will *happen* more and more
