-- over 350 new species including the world 's smallest deer , a " flying frog " and a 100 million - year old gecko have been discovered in the @entity6 , a biological treasure trove now threatened by climate change			1
the region studied covers a vast expanse of the mountain region			2
a decade of research carried out by scientists for the @entity15 in remote mountain areas brought discoveries such as a bright green frog that uses its red and long webbed feet to glide in the air			2
the @entity15 report , " the @entity6 -- where @entity33 , " details discoveries made by scientists from various organizations between 1998 and 2008 in a region reaching across @entity30 and northeast @entity31 to the far north of @entity32 as well as @entity22 and southern parts of @entity24 in @entity25			1
" the good news of this explosion in species discoveries is tempered by the increasing threats to the @entity6 ' cultural and biological diversity , " @entity35 , director of @entity15 's @entity36 , said in a press statement			1
" this rugged and remarkable landscape is already seeing direct , measurable impacts from climate change and risks being lost forever			0
" the report describes more than 350 new species discovered , including 244 plants , 16 amphibians , 16 reptiles , 14 fish , two birds , two mammals and at least 60 new invertebrates			1
one of the most significant findings was not exactly " new " in the classic sense			0
a 100 - million year - old gecko , the oldest fossil gecko species known to science , was discovered in an amber mine in the @entity63 in the northern @entity32			1
the report mentions the miniature muntjac , also called the " leaf deer , " which is the world 's oldest and smallest deer species			1
scientists initially believed the small creature found in the world 's largest mountain range was a juvenile of another species but dna tests confirmed it was a new species			2
the @entity6 harbor a staggering 10,000 plant species , 300 mammal species , 977 bird species , 176 reptiles , 105 amphibians and 269 types of freshwater fish			0
the region also has the highest density of @entity87 in the world and is the last bastion of the charismatic greater one - horned rhino			0
historically , the rugged and largely inaccessible landscape of the @entity6 has made biological surveys in the region extremely difficult			0
as a result , wildlife has remained poorly surveyed and there are large areas that are still biologically unexplored .			0
