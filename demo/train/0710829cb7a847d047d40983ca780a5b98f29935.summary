-- for @entity3 's @entity7 -- the name for the @entity3 - based press corps that follows the pope -- covering the closed world of the @entity6 is like attending to a nuclear missile silo ; it 's largely routine until the balloon goes up			1
opaque , hierarchical and arcane , the @entity6 is a tough beat even for seasoned reporters			1
it involves paying punctilious attention to papal routine -- never missing the often dreary papal audiences on a wednesday and the uneventful address from the @entity6 on sunday			1
even then , getting blind - sided by stark @entity6 announcements that drop without warning is a risk that comes with the round			1
while many might see shades of @entity25 in the @entity6 's media style , some of it can be attributed to the tradition of humility that comes with holding the @entity29			1
@entity30 on understatement , low on fanfare , first news of pope @entity35 's resignation came in a low key speech read by the pope in @entity38 at a routine consistory , a type of ecclesiastical council meeting			1
" it 's important , but it 's not one of those events that you underline over and over again in your agenda , " @entity48 @entity6 reporter @entity47 told the @entity49			1
" if you 're covering it , you 're doing so just as a precautionary measure , to report what happened			2
" @entity55 's @entity54 news agency , whose correspondent @entity56 understood the @entity38 , was first to break the news			2
other correspondents at the consistory struggled to make sense of the speech			0
reporter first on pope story , thanks to her @entity38 skills " at a certain point , for example , i caught the word ' incapability ' in the pope 's speech , " @entity47 told the @entity66			1
" i turned around and spoke with my @entity74 colleague			0
we noticed that @entity76 @entity35 had a sad look on his face , not his usual look			1
then , when cardinal @entity81 mentioned the ' sadness , ' we finally understood			0
then father @entity83 confirmed his resignation over the phone			2
" for the @entity3 press corps -- laboring under the cycle of constantly falling governments , @entity89 stories , and offbeat it - could - only - happen - in - @entity55 stories -- regime change at the @entity6 ( arguably one of the biggest news stories in the world ) provides a raison d'etre to a sometimes sleepy beat			1
now , pope @entity35 's resignation -- the first in 600 years -- has rewritten the rule book ; not just for the @entity6 , which now goes through a complex and unprecedented interregnum , but also for the @entity6 press corps			1
normally , @entity6 - watching requires close attention to the pope 's health - a source of low - burning anxiety for the press corps who are charged with the difficult task of taking the pulse of a man who , at best , is often seen at a distance of hundreds of meters and , at worst , whose health is a closely guarded secret			1
it was a running joke among @entity120 that the pope is always in robust health until he is dead			1
certainly for the small , undermanned @entity124 wire agency that i worked for in @entity3 during the 1990s , keeping on top of @entity128 's health was a full - time job			1
" i do n't like the sound of that cough , '' my then - bureau chief , @entity132 , once quipped during the weekly papal audience on @entity55 's national @entity135 television station , @entity134			1
it was the kind of remark that tempted fate			0
@entity132 may have been a press corps veteran of five papal deaths dating back to @entity140 in 1958 , but he was not sure he could survive another one			2
when do you know it 's time to go ? " a papal death is an unbelievable sweat , '' he recalled at the time			1
" six weeks solid , sleeping in the office and filing at all hours			0
i would n't want to go through that again at my age			0
'' when i asked him how he had felt when @entity151 , after being chosen to succeed @entity150 in august 1978 , died 33 days later , he shot me a horrified look , as if i had asked how he had felt after a family tragedy			0
" how do you think i felt ? '' he shot back			0
" it was absolutely heartbreaking ! '' no cough went unremarked , no tremor unnoticed			0
the health of the @entity76 took on a life outside its subject and , in the absence of any hard information from the @entity6 , was often decided on journalistic consensus			1
whether the @entity76 " spoke in a clear voice '' or looked " tired " depended entirely on which angle you were coming from -- well for a man who had parkinson 's disease but not very well for a man who used to go skiing on his holidays			2
in journalistic terms , a papal death is rolling thunder			2
it 's not just the death ; it 's the funeral , the curia , the conclave , electing cardinals , @entity6 insiders , pope - makers and pope - breakers , the coronation			1
every country in the world with a sizeable @entity135 population holds out the hope that its cardinal will get a chance at the top slot			0
for a wire service , they must all be served			0
adding to the agony is the simple fact that the exact second of any natural death is always an unknown			0
as @entity128 's health began to falter , networks and agencies , as a measure of their anxiety , had already begun to cut deals with landlords to rent apartments adjacent to the @entity6 to get the best possible shots			1
while our agency did n't have the firepower of other wire services or networks , it did have history on its side			0
with a complete set of files on three papal deaths , it was a formidable armory containing detailed background stories -- parts of which could be used again in some form or another -- on the death , the funeral , the conclave , the election , the coronation			2
running through the yellowing subsidiary wire stories on papal deaths of yesteryear was like opening a time capsule			2
they included such gems as an embalming that had gone wrong , fouling the air for the mourners lined up to see the pope lying in state			2
another story detailed how @entity55 had outraged foreign dignitaries by clapping the coffin at the funeral ( a wholly normal custom at @entity55 funerals )			0
like a nuclear missile silo , my agency 's @entity6 file had its own doomsday file - a hardbound manila folder on which a typewritten sticky label had emblazoned in telex font capitals : @entity254			1
while many of the instructions dated back to 1961 and could be safely ignored , it was still an interesting study in panic			0
the first step was to put a call through to the @entity264 bureau , the instructions read : " it should take you no longer than three minutes for the operator to get you a line , " it hectored			0
the next step was to source the news to the @entity55 wire agency @entity54 or @entity271 releasing a bulletin that read : vatican city -- @entity274 dead at a lower wire speed priority			0
the pope could actually be dead for hours , and the world fully informed of the fact , before the news came officially from the @entity6 press office			1
only then could the bulletin : vatican city -- @entity282 dead be released at " flash '' priority -- the highest wire speed reserved for papal deaths , presidential assassinations and a few other world beating news stories			2
after the " flash " went out , as @entity132 recalled at the time , it was a total circus and anyone 's race			2
" it was hugely and highly secretive , and there were rumors flying around for weeks , '' he told me			0
" the whole thing was fairly agonizing			0
'' the secretive conclave , in which electing cardinals are " locked in '' the @entity6 until a decision on the next pope is made , is tension personified			1
the only indication as to whether a decision is made comes from the burning of the ballots at the end of each day			0
according to @entity6 lore , the smoke is black ( due to the fact that the ballots were mixed with damp hay ) when a decision is still to be reached and white when a new pope has been decided			1
in the case of @entity319 , the smoke went from black to white to a sort of grey color and back to white again , @entity132 recalled			0
" the whole thing was sort of medieval , '' @entity132 told me at the time			0
these days chemicals , rather than hay , are mixed with the ballots to prevent the kind of confusion that occurred with @entity319			0
the most nerve - racking part of the enterprise , however , was backgrounding the more than 100 electing cardinals , all of whom theoretically had a chance at the top job			1
" and they always chose someone you 'd never heard of			0
i remember @entity319 was just the papal nuncio in @entity338 -- no one considered him for a moment , " @entity132 told me			2
" and all the time , if the other ( agencies ) were ahead by five minutes , you were lost .			0

for @entity7 , *monitoring* the pontiff 's health is a big part of the job
pope @entity35 's resignation has added a new dimension to a tough beat
@entity352 for tone and nuance is essential in *divining* @entity6 direction
reporting on a papal election is a nerve - racking free for all
