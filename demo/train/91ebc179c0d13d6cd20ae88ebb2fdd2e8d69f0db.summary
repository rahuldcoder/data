june 21 is the longest day of the year			0
yes , from now on , we 'll lose a few minutes of daylight each day			0
before that panicked feeling of time slipping away kicks in ( i already have too much to do and now my days will be even shorter ? ) , take a deep breath			1
first off , it turns out our time is n't as scarce as we have convinced ourselves it is			1
and second , new research has demonstrated effective strategies to help mitigate the pangs of our time famine			0
no one can truly give you more time -- after all , there are only 24 hours in a day regardless of how long or short those hours feel -- but a few simple changes in how you spend your time , and your money , can turn feelings of famine into feelings of plenty			1
our general feeling of time scarcity is n't just caused by shortening days			1
on a larger scale , people seem to have the sense that their time has become more limited -- that compared to earlier generations , we spend more and more time working and have less and less free time to engage in leisure pursuits			1
indeed , this general feeling of an impending time famine has helped give rise to the @entity39 , with pursuits ranging from @entity41 to @entity42 and @entity43 ( which we thought was kind of slow to begin with ) promising to help the time - poor get off the high - speed treadmill of modern life			1
but this basic premise turns out to be an illusion			0
the most comprehensive data from major time - use surveys suggest that , if anything , @entity51 today have more free time than earlier generations			1
that 's right : the number of hours we work has not changed much , but we spend less time now on home tasks , so we have a greater amount of time for leisure than in decades past			2
so , why do we feel like time is so scarce ? one problem is that our time has become more valuable			2
and as time becomes worth more money , we feel like we have less of it			1
workers who bill or get paid by the hour -- think lawyers and fast - food workers -- report focusing more on pursuing more money than those who get paid a salary			2
and the effect happens fast			0
in one experiment , people were told to play the role of consultants and bill their time at either $ 9 an hour or $ 90 an hour			1
when people billed their time for $ 90 an hour , they reported feeling far more pressed for time			1
thinking about our time as money changes our behavior as well			2
in another study , people who billed their time were less likely to volunteer their time for good causes			2
once we start to think about how much money we are giving up ( i could make $ 90 instead of helping out in that soup kitchen ) , it suddenly seems foolish to sacrifice the cash just to ladle some soup to strangers			1
and the effects are evident in more everyday interactions , too			0
in one study , people who were instructed to think about money before entering a cafe spent less time chatting with the other patrons and more time working			1
those who were thinking about their time did the reverse , spending time socializing instead of working			2
so what 's the problem with a little less socializing and a little less volunteering ? both of these activities are strongly associated with happiness			0
volunteers are happier people , and social interaction is a key element of human well - being			0
indeed , one recent study showed that just taking the time to chat with the cashier at @entity118 left people feeling happier than simply making the same exchange as efficient as possible			1
chatting , it seems , is good for our happiness			0
being happier would be nice , we can all agree , but do volunteering and socializing have any impact on solving our feelings of time famine ? luckily , the benefits of these activities extend beyond happiness			0
when people feel their time is scarce , they often attempt to carve out some " me " time -- going for a massage or taking a nap			1
sure , massages and snoozes are great , and undeniably nice while in progress			0
but research shows that once they are over , we feel just as stressed about our time as we did before			2
instead , our research shows that encouraging people to spend time on and with others -- for example , shoveling someone 's driveway in the winter or helping a student with her homework -- actually makes people feel less stressed about their own time			1
in fact , helping others makes us feel more effective in our ability to get our daily tasks done			2
helping others makes us feel as though we accomplished a goal , and that feeling of accomplishment appears to carry over to when we turn from helping others back to checking off tasks on our own to - do lists			1
the modern time famine appears to be primarily in our heads ; we do n't really have more to do than we did in the good old days			0
as a result , fixing the time famine requires intervention in the mind , via strategies that alleviate the stress of perceived time scarcity			0
and lest you think that decreasing your time stress is a waste of , well , time , research shows that feelings of time affluence are a crucial contributor to our happiness			0
and that holds true even for people who say they like being busy			0
when time feels short -- whether due to the change of seasons or the sheer number of things we must get done -- our inclination is to hunker down and focus on making more money and treating ourselves			0
it may be wiser when strapped for time to use the time you have to reach out and help someone else .			0

**authors** : @entity51 perceive they have less time and more to do
they say best data show @entity51 are n't working more , only feeling more rushed
as people make more money per hour , they *'re* more likely to feel pressed for time , they say
**authors** : people feel less pressed if they spend time helping others
