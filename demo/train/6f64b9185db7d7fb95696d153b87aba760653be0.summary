@entity1 province , @entity2 -- @entity4 has many translations in the various languages spoken across @entity7			1
but words alone can not describe its power and splendor -- it 's a necessary force of nature , thundering life back into fields parched by endless days of summer , where the rains create lush landscapes of vivid greens and intense marigold			1
it is awaited with bated breath ; people anticipate the storm , welcome it and embrace its fury			2
this year the monsoon rains came late but when they did it was with an unrelenting force that brought massive flooding to parts of @entity2 - administered @entity30 and across the plains of @entity1 province , wreaking devastation and disaster along the way			1
so far , more than 400 people have been killed across @entity37 and @entity2 , with tens of thousands more displaced			1
according to @entity2 's @entity39 , " exceptionally heavy to very heavy rains from september 4 to 7 resulted in exceptionally high flood discharges at various control points on the @entity42			1
" the rains have now eased , leaving behind the deep waters from this year 's deluge			1
on our journey to the city of @entity49 in southern @entity1 , the road passes along the @entity42 , which literally translates as @entity50			2
the river has swollen and swallowed entire towns -- and livelihoods			2
at one point , we see the dome of a mosque peeking up through the waters as displaced families stand helplessly with their livestock on higher ground nearby wondering where to camp for the night			1
relief camps on the outskirts of @entity49 , a relief camp has been set up by the government			2
men mill around by the roadside while the women sit inside the canvas tents , their children running around outside in the foggy heat -- the humidity seems so thick one could slice it with a knife			0
@entity2 last suffered from massive floods in 2010 when close to one fifth of the country was submerged underwater			1
this year 's flooding is not as devastating but the outlook is still quite grim			1
thirty - five - year - old @entity82 is angry			2
forced to find shelter in the camp , the rage and desperation is palpable in his voice : " i have nine children , we have been out here for six days			0
i took nothing with me , we 've only been given water and some rice by the authorities			0
when will i be able to go back home ? " just a few kilometers away from the camp , under an awning , sit representatives from @entity101 's @entity100 , an indication of how this calamity is slowly becoming politicized			0
the city of @entity49 lies closest to @entity105 , through which the @entity42 flows			0
this barrier , which is in place to stem flooding and aid irrigation , has a capacity of 600,000 cusecs , or cubic feet per second , which is the measure for the flow rate of water			2
but according to @entity2 's @entity118 ( @entity39 ) , on the evening of september 12 , close to 800,000 cusecs of water will pass through the barrage , causing flooding in the surrounding districts of @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity49 and @entity125			1
helicopter perspective @entity3 was given access to a military rescue helicopter that flew over the flooded areas close to @entity49 and near the head of @entity105			1
the muddy waters that had inundated roads , villages and homes went on as far as the eye could see			1
our helicopter eventually descended close to the head of the barrage to deliver engines for rescue boats			2
lines of tents had been set up on a narrow strip of land along the barrage for the many displaced people in the area			1
@entity149 stood nearby holding her baby ; she had left her home only a day ago			0
" we did n't pick up anything , " she said			0
" we scooped up our children in our arms and fled			0
" a group of young boys holding metal water containers dipped their feet into the water			0
" @entity161 " they said , " but we miss home			0
" according to @entity164 , an activist for the education campaign @entity165 , 948 schools have closed down in the district of @entity49 alone			0
the government ordered them to be closed on september 5			0
it will take close to 20 days for them to reopen , though " nothing is certain yet , " said @entity164			0
the scale of the crisis is such that @entity39 has now requested assistance from the @entity176 ( @entity176 )			0
@entity177 , a @entity176 spokesperson , told @entity3 " the @entity178 is discussing with the @entity39 the possibility to support the government in carrying out an immediate and detailed assessment			1
" until then , many ordinary @entity2 are on their own			1
as dusk settled on the road to the city of @entity122 , which lies to south - west of @entity49 , two young men using rubber tires to stay afloat took advantage of the fact that the fish farms nearby had broken open to catch some carp			0
" it 's the easiest access to food , " @entity191 told @entity3			2
" we do n't know when this is going to end , we must make do with what we get			0
