@entity0 , @entity1 -- a moderate @entity4 party claimed victory in @entity1 's first parliamentary elections since constitutional reforms this summer			1
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) won 107 of the 395 seats , interior minister @entity8 said sunday			1
the next biggest winner was the @entity14 , also known as the @entity14 , with 60 seats , the @entity12 's website reported			2
the number of parties involved in @entity1 's multiparty system means it was unlikely a single party would win a majority of the seats , so a coalition government would have to be formed			1
@entity24 secretary of state @entity23 offered her congratulations saturday " on the successful completion " of the elections			1
" the @entity24 stands ready to work with the new parliament and the people of @entity1 to strengthen the rule of law , raise human rights standards , promote transparent and accountable governance , and work toward sustained , democratic reform , " she said			2
turnout in the @entity36 country was 45 % , the @entity12 said friday			2
the @entity37 -- which had 41 accredited observers from 21 countries that went to over 200 polling stations on friday -- said in a news release that the elections " were conducted transparently			1
" the voting process was described as " technically sound " and " without fear of tampering or procedural violations			0
" but one institute member , @entity48 leader @entity47 , also pointed to the turnout and a number of invalid and spoiled ballots as negatives			0
" seeing the number of people who actively spoiled their ballots as well as those who did not participate , it is clear that the path to real change will take more effort and time , " @entity47 said			0
@entity62 , senior lecturer in @entity63 at the @entity64 in @entity65 , said friday that the outcome might signal whether the population is happy with the monarchy or not			0
the more votes for the @entity9 appear to indicate a desire for greater change , she said -- as opposed to votes for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties , which would suggest voters favor the status quo			0
under the new constitution , approved by referendum in july , both @entity77 and the prime minister have greater powers , while the monarch 's sway has been slightly lessened			1
the changes mean the prime minister must now be chosen from the party that wins the greatest number of votes -- which , based on the preliminary results , would be the @entity9 -- rather than @entity88 selecting his own nominee for the job			1
the reforms came after thousands of @entity1 took to the streets to demonstrate earlier this year , inspired by what became known as the @entity94			2
the youth - based february 20 movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies			0
analysts say economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country 's young people , particularly many university graduates who are unemployed			0
