@entity1 , @entity0 -- during the current economic crisis , high - flying women have been overlooked for promotion , according to a study out tuesday			1
at the upper level of management , business is still dominated by men			0
the study , by @entity12 nonprofit research group @entity11 , surveyed 873 mba alumni who graduated between 1996 and 2007 , asking how their careers had fared between november 2007 and june 2009			2
the results showed that overall , male and female @entity17 have proved resilient to the recession and have fared equally well in the @entity12 , @entity19 and @entity20 , with 31 percent of surveyed women reporting that they had been promoted during that time period , compared to 36 percent of men			1
however in @entity23 , just 26 per cent of women were promoted , compared with 44 percent of men , according to the study published in the @entity25			1
according to the @entity25 , of the @entity12 @entity28 companies only two per cent of the @entity26 are women , and only 15 per cent of the seats on their boards of directors are held by women			2
professor @entity34 is the director of the @entity35 at @entity36 in @entity0			0
she told @entity2 that while it is n't clear why the figures for @entity23 in particular show such a gender discrepancy , it reflects discrimination faced by women business leaders in general			2
read more business related features " there is a whole stream of research of male and female @entity17 that systematically shows the more senior they get the bigger the disparities in salaries and promotion , " she said			1
" immediately after the mba -- at the mid level -- women do quite well , but as they progress upwards the disparities emerge and get wider			0
that 's not just for @entity17 , it 's the function of men and women in the workforce in general			1
" when it comes to the top tier , women worldwide were much more likely than men to lose their jobs , with 19 percent of female senior executives losing their jobs , compared with six per cent of men			2
@entity65 , general manager of @entity23 told @entity2 that the discrepancy is probably not the result of the current economic malaise			2
" these figures reflect what has been a challenge in @entity23 for a number years , " she said			0
" the talent pipeline in @entity23 is clearly not as robust for women			0
this study indicates that by and large this is not directly related to the economic crisis , but it may have magnified the discrepancy			1
" @entity78 cites @entity80 corporate culture , perpetuation of gender - based stereotypes , exclusion of women from informal networks and a lack of role models as reasons behind the discrepancy			1
@entity36 produces what it calls the " @entity90 , " showing the percentage of female directors in @entity94 's top 100 companies			0
@entity34 says that in the last 10 years the number of female directors has hardly improved , increasing from seven per cent to just 11 percent			0
@entity34 adds that she has found anecdotal evidence that a number of senior women in the @entity94 banking sector have chosen to leave their jobs , rather than work in a " high pressure , highly controlling " work environment brought about by the economic crisis			1
the @entity11 study also shows that many @entity17 are n't letting the economic crisis get in the way of career advancement			1
overall , 34 percent of respondents had received a promotion and 35 percent made a lateral move			0
" the data almost indicates business as usual , in highly unusual times for business , " @entity65 told @entity2			0
the common perception might be that given the current economic uncertainty , employees would choose to play it safe rather than chance their luck in a volatile job market , but the study found that @entity17 have been willing to risk career moves , with 20 percent of respondents changing jobs , 14 percent relocating and four percent starting their own business			1
@entity65 said that @entity17 represent " high - potential employees " who tend to be entrepreneurial and show a high level of initiative			1
she added that these individuals tend to be opportunistic when it comes to their careers , seeking out new developmental opportunities , exploring lateral moves , looking at options around relocating , and choosing other employment opportunities to make sure they are n't negatively impacted by recession			0
" the results are sobering for a corporate sector which may have assumed that people would be grateful to have a job and would n't necessarily be exploring other options , " she said			0
" for companies to rest on their laurels and assume they do n't need to worry about retention is a mistake			0

study : high - flying women are missing out on promotion
discrepancy in female promotions may have been magnified by recession
elsewhere , male and female @entity17 proving *resistant* to the economic crisis
" high - potential employees " willing to change roles , despite harsh job market
