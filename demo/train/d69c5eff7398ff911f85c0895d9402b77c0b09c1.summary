-- there were so many golden moments at the @entity3 , but for me , the moment that @entity6 's @entity5 won the 10,000 meters was a wonderful collision of electricity			1
i was performing stand up , downstairs at the @entity10 in @entity11 -- i was about fifteen minutes in to the gig when i heard the whole of the cool and trendy @entity10 district of @entity11 explode into noise			0
i ran offstage to get my @entity16 and i got the @entity18 live feed streaming just in time to see @entity5 hugging his @entity20 training partner , @entity19 , who took silver			1
i was recounting all this live on stage to the audience			0
that was quite a moment of running , internet technology and ' where were you when ? ' rolled into one			0
the thing about @entity30 -- apart from his endless speed , dedication , humility and talent -- is that he came to @entity37 as a refugee from @entity39 , one of the world 's most war - torn countries			1
some people in the @entity45 stupidly want to denigrate refugees , so you knew these people were having a bad day when @entity30 won			1
that same night , he was asked in a press conference whether he 'd have preferred to run as a @entity39			2
@entity30 just laughed and said : " look mate , this is my country			0
this is where i grew up , this is where i started life			0
this is my country and when i put on my @entity37 vest i 'm proud			1
" olympics have redefined how @entity37 sees itself during these @entity60 , i have felt very proud to be @entity45 and proud of the @entity45			1
what @entity30 said set @entity63 alight			0
it also set everybody talking about the @entity37 we are in 2012			2
he spoke for us all , and made the whole country proud to be @entity45 too			1
i think the @entity3 will come to be seen as a shining time for the @entity45			1
it has been a time when athletes of all races and backgrounds have come together , and people have understood what modern multicultural @entity37 is all about , and that it obviously is working - no matter that @entity75 says it is n't			1
hosting the @entity60 has also united people from all corners of the country			2
instead of seeing ourselves as @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85 , we have felt @entity45			2
right from the moment of the opening ceremony , it has felt as if @entity37 suddenly had the confident voice it had been looking for since the height of the @entity91			1
@entity92 , the @entity45 director behind films like @entity94 , had produced his idea called @entity96			2
instead of recycling the usual cliches about quaint old @entity98 , he gave us something between incredible spectacle and political theater			0
one of the central pieces of the whole event was a tribute to @entity37 's @entity105 , probably our country 's proudest achievement			1
@entity108 knows what the rest of the world made of patients singing in hospital beds , but we knew exactly what he meant -- and they could work it out			0
@entity37 is quite a shy country ( unless we 've had a drink )			2
we do n't like to blow our own trumpets			0
we do n't wear our stiff upper lips on our sleeves ( which is actually quite difficult to do )			0
but we 've all found our own ways to be patriotic ( as opposed to @entity121 )			0
i had one of my nails painted with a @entity125 , as is my right as a marathon - running transvestite who supports @entity6 @entity3 has been the best @entity45 performance in an @entity60 for 100 years , and the country has gone wild			1
2012 games leave @entity11 with a golden glow before the @entity60 , i ran with the @entity60 flame in my old home town of @entity134 in the south of @entity82 , which was a tremendous honor			1
there i have sponsored an art project by sculptor @entity138 as part of the @entity45 's @entity140			1
he balanced a large bus on the roof of a large art center building there to recreate the final moment of the original version of the film " @entity148			0
" why ? well , well because it is ballsy and artistic and @entity45 and crazy			2
and so , above all , i hope the word goes out from our @entity60 that not only do we run excellent world events , but we also balance buses on the edges of buildings like no one else ever could			2
next , it 's the @entity158			0
i ca n't wait to see how our atmosphere carries on			0
once a small gathering of @entity45 veterans of the @entity163 , this will be the moment the @entity158 comes home			1
i 've been lucky enough to have had a similar view of the @entity45 as the @entity60 flame did as it traveled my country , because in 2009 , i ran 43 marathons -- 1166 miles -- around the @entity169 , and i saw first hand , how positive and supportive the real @entity45 people can be			1
over the past few weeks you have seen that @entity37 -- my kind of @entity37 -- in action			0
i hope you all enjoyed it -- we did ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0
