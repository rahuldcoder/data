it 's the war that never really ended -- leaving the @entity1 splintered in 1953			2
the brutal war that raged 60 years ago killed more than two million @entity3 , separated thousands of families , and created the world 's most heavily fortified border			1
it also drew the alliances that exist today			1
the armistice agreement that ended the war is a truce , rather than a peace treaty			1
starting on tuesday , @entity13 threatened to dismantle the armistice , as it has done so in the past			1
in 2009 , @entity13 said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because @entity18 was joining a @entity21 - led anti-proliferation plan			1
in 2003 , @entity23 's official @entity22 ( @entity24 ) announced that it may have " no option " but to stop honoring the armistice because of the @entity27 's " persistent war moves			1
" this time , @entity24 declared that come march 11 , @entity3 forces will " completely declare invalid " the armistice agreement , because " the @entity21 imperialists and the south @entity3 puppet forces " have violated it			1
it cited joint @entity21 - @entity18 military exercises as " an open declaration of a war " and slammed the countries using its trademark colorful language			0
" the @entity21 is , however , working with bloodshot eyes to swallow up the @entity3 ( the @entity3 , @entity13 's official name ) , not content with having incurred the pent - up grudge of the @entity3 people which can never be settled			1
what matters is that the @entity18 puppet forces steeped in worship and sycophancy toward the @entity21 are dancing to its tune , " @entity24 said			0
the latest flare - up stems from tougher sanctions passed in the @entity49 against @entity13 in response to its nuclear test on february 12			1
@entity52 carried out its third nuclear test , despite international condemnation			0
here 's a look into the tension between the @entity57 and why a @entity59 conflict still affects global dynamics			0
causes for most of the first half of the 20th century , @entity62 controlled the @entity1 as its colony			0
by the @entity66 as @entity62 neared defeat , the allies agreed to an independent @entity13			1
the @entity21 and @entity68 divided postwar occupation of @entity13 along the 38th parallel and the two sides were ideologically opposite			1
to the north was @entity73 , the grandfather of @entity13 's current leader , @entity74			1
as a communist guerrilla leader , @entity73 had trained in @entity76 and resisted @entity62 rule in @entity13 and @entity78			1
with revolutionary credentials , he was favored by the @entity68			0
in the south , a separate election in 1948 brought @entity82 , a @entity21 - educated independence advocate who was intensely anti-communist , as the first president of the @entity3			2
both @entity82 and @entity74 wanted to unify the peninsula under their respective governments			0
tensions festered between the two sides , backed by their respective superpower allies			0
how the war broke out on june 25 , 1950 , a surprise attack by @entity3 soldiers who crossed the 38th parallel easily overwhelmed @entity18 forces			1
the @entity21 leapt to the defense of the @entity18			0
as @entity18 , @entity21 and @entity49 forces fought back and gained ground into @entity13 , @entity97 forces joined the war on the @entity13 's side later that year			1
the fighting continued until the signing of the armistice in july 1953			0
the terms of the armistice included the creation of the @entity107 , a heavily fortified 155 - mile long ( 250 kilometers ) 2.5 - mile wide line separating the two countries			0
the toll of the war included about 1.2 million deaths in @entity18 , 1 million deaths in @entity13 , 36,500 deaths for @entity21 troops and 600,000 deaths for @entity97 soldiers			1
the @entity3 rivalry immediately after the war , the @entity13 became economically prosperous with the backing of the @entity68			1
however , as the @entity68 collapsed in the 1990s , so did the @entity3 economy and the rice rations distributed to its people disappeared			2
a famine in the 1990s is believed to have killed as much as 10 percent of the population			0
in stark contrast , @entity18 had a turbulent start after the war with autocratic leadership and struggled as one of the poorest economies in the world			0
but the country 's economy gained ground in the late 1960s , which is now heralded as a model for economic miracles			0
it now ranks as the fourth largest economy in @entity139			0
president @entity140 was one of the founders of modern @entity13 who took power after a coup d'etat and ruled with a heavy hand for 18 years before his assassination in 1979			1
some in @entity18 regard him as the cornerstone of the country 's present prosperity ; others view him as a dictator			0
his daughter , @entity153 became the new president of @entity18 last month			0
she took office with a pledge to keep @entity18 safe against the threat of an increasingly hostile @entity13			2
tense relationship in the last 60 years , diplomacy between @entity13 has zigzagged from conciliatory to bellicose			1
during more friendly times , the two countries arranged emotional family reunions for those separated by the war in 2000 , their leaders shook hands in a 2007 @entity52 summit and ran freight trains across the border			2
@entity18 president @entity171 won the @entity172 in 2000 for his efforts for " peace and reconciliation " with @entity13 , although his legacy remains mixed			2
but periods of rapprochement have been counterpointed by violence , with incidents such as the 1983 bombing that killed members of the @entity18 cabinet visiting @entity184 and another bombing in 1987 that blew up @entity186 , killing all aboard			0
despite investigations that found that @entity13 carried out both attacks , the government in @entity52 has steadfastly denied involvement			2
more recently , the @entity13 shelled the @entity18 island of @entity192 leaving two marines and two civilians dead			2
@entity52 claimed @entity195 provoked the 2010 attack by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the @entity200			0
that same year , @entity13 was also accused of sinking a @entity18 warship , killing more than 40 sailors			2
the incidents caused widespread anger in @entity18			0
relations have remained fraught , especially after @entity13 's nuclear testing last month , which the @entity18 government has denounced as " an unforgivable threat to the @entity1 's peace and safety			2
" @entity97 , a long - standing ally to @entity13 since the war , backed the @entity49 resolution for more sanctions against the nation			1
the sanctions target uranium enrichment and luxury goods -- aimed at @entity13 's ruling elite			2
@entity97 has previously resisted strong sanctions on the @entity74 regime , which it supports economically			0
in a @entity226 editorial that received significant attention in @entity139 media , @entity221 , a senior editor of the @entity222 , the journal of @entity97 's @entity224 , urged @entity97 to " re-evaluate its longstanding alliance with the @entity74 dynasty			0
" " even if @entity13 was a useful friend during the cold war , its usefulness today is doubtful , " @entity221 wrote .			1
