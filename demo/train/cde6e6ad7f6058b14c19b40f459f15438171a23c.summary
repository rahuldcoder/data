-- the biggest upset of the @entity3 playoffs took place this week when @entity5 , the most controversial head coach in professional sports , stepped behind a podium and said , well , nothing			1
" i do n't have a whole lot to say , so let 's open it up for questions , " said @entity5 , the man whose words have been the talk of professional football since he became the head coach of the @entity13			1
@entity5 has brazenly talked about winning a @entity18 from the moment he took the job two years ago			1
he called his playoff matchup against future @entity23 quarterback @entity22 of the @entity24 " personal , " then made the same statement this week about facing @entity27 head coach @entity26 on sunday			1
he has come under fire for making an obscene gesture at a mixed martial arts event and his r - rated language during the @entity33 series " @entity34 " this summer			2
each week this fall , whether it be the foot - fetish videos that apparently involve him and his wife or his constant barrage of brash talk , @entity5 has been the most talked about figure in @entity42 sports			1
it is unclear how the videos , which were posted on the sports website @entity46 , ended up on the internet , but they were a rare example of something @entity5 would not talk about			1
he repeatedly called the issue " a personal matter , " but it still landed him on the front pages of the tabloids			2
depending on who you ask , he is the best thing to happen to the @entity3 in years : a refreshingly honest force of nature who has proven that a coach does n't have to be a clich√© - spewing robot to be successful			2
or , he is an egotistical blowhard who has put unnecessary pressure on his team with his boastful statements , especially since the @entity13 must beat the hottest team in football , the 14 - 2 @entity27 , on the road sunday to advance in the playoffs			1
there is no middle ground with @entity5			1
is he good for football ? that is open to debate			2
but , no matter what you think of the 47 - year - old head coach , this much is certain : everyone is talking about him			2
" the mistake any coach makes is trying to be someone he 's not , " said @entity81 , who took the @entity82 to the @entity18 in 2000 and worked with @entity5 when @entity5 was a defensive coach with the @entity83			1
" @entity5 is always going to be @entity5			1
you can either like it or not like it , but i like it when a coach is being himself			2
you wo n't get @entity26 to do that			0
" @entity26 , the three - time @entity18 winner in @entity27 , is the perfect contrast			1
he was asked in the days leading up to this second - round playoff game his opinion about the bravado coming out of his opponent , and his response was typically subdued			2
" our job , really , is just to get ready for the game , " @entity26 said , " so that 's what we 're going to go do			2
" @entity5 has the same job , of course , and he 's doing something right			1
in just two seasons , he already has more playoff victories , with three , than any @entity13 coach to come before him			1
he is regarded as one of the brightest defensive minds in the game , a whiz for coming up with the perfect blitz packages to rattle the opposing quarterbacks			0
not that anybody spends much time talking about that			0
" he 's a sideshow to everyone outside of @entity42 , " @entity123 , a host of the sports - radio station @entity124 , told his audience during a spirited debate about the pros and cons of @entity5 's constant chatter			1
" they laugh at him			0
" they may laugh at him , but they certainly pay attention to him			0
much like his father , @entity136 , he has made most of his news with his outsized personality			0
@entity139 was the defensive coordinator for the @entity140 , the mastermind of maybe the greatest defense in @entity3 history			0
the @entity140 won the @entity18 after the 1985 season , and @entity139 went on to become a head coach in @entity146 and @entity147			1
but the elder @entity5 was a failure as a head coach most known for controversy			1
he once said a player he cut was " worth about two beers and they do n't have to be cold ones			0
" he is the coach who threw a punch at @entity156 , then the offensive coordinator on his own team			2
" i 'm not smart enough to lie , " the now retired elder @entity5 said last season when asked about his penchant for creating controversy			1
" if you 're honest , you have nothing to worry about			0
if you lie , you have to watch what you say			0
" @entity5 saw that devil - may - care attitude up close			1
he started his slow climb up the coaching ladder in 1987 , making $ 200 a week as a graduate assistant at @entity169 , before becoming part of the @entity83 staff that won the @entity18 in 2000			1
" when i was a defensive coordinator i would say the same things , but instead of having this many reporters , " he said to a room with about 100 of them , " there may have been one or two			0
now , it 's just a bigger stage , but i was still the same person then as i am now			0
" that person has continued to violate virtually every unspoken rule about coaching a football team			0
coaches are never supposed to provide bulletin - board material for their opponents			0
coaches are supposed to guard information like state secrets			0
@entity5 is like a human @entity190 when it comes to injury reports , offering up more than the league requires			1
owner @entity194 knew a big personality came with his new coach , but even he had no idea just how big			2
" when i saw that first press conference , it took my breath away a little bit , " @entity194 said			0
" i was so happy he had the confidence to state what his objective is			0
it 's easier to lead people to someplace that you can talk about			0
" the @entity13 have followed their leader			1
this week , the biggest story was not how their young quarterback @entity210 would do against the @entity27 defense , but how one of their cornerbacks , @entity212 , announced that he " hated " @entity27 quarterback @entity215 ( using a few unprintable words in the process )			0
the response from @entity5 ? no apology			1
" you should n't like who you are up against right now , " he said			0
" this is the playoffs			0
i can tell you our whole football team respects @entity215 and the @entity27			0
there 's no question , but hey , we do n't like any of them right now			0
i think that 's just part of it and trust me , the feeling is mutual			0
" @entity5 's team has supplanted the old - school @entity82 as the dominant team in the @entity42 market , maybe for the first time in its history			1
his team has stolen the pages of the @entity42 tabloids for months , and as long as the @entity13 keep winning , that does n't figure to change any time soon			1
the @entity3 is a copycat league			0
the @entity27 ' success has spawned an army of @entity26 clones , with only modest success			0
could @entity5 lead a similar revolution of brash - talking coaches around the league ? even one of his longtime players is n't sure about that			1
" i do n't know if the @entity3 is ready for an onslaught of @entity257 , " @entity13 linebacker @entity254 said with a laugh			2
right now , one @entity5 is stirring up enough controversy all on his own .			2

@entity263 : @entity5 " has brazenly talked about winning a @entity18 from the moment he took the job "
@entity5 has already won more playoff games than any other @entity13 coach
