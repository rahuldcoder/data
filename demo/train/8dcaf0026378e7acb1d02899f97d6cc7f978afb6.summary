-- @entity1 getting very personal with @entity2			0
@entity3 squaring off against @entity4 and @entity5 during a pivotal 1992 campaign interview			0
@entity7 going to confession with @entity9			0
all were " big get " interviews in what 's become tv - speak for marquee encounters			0
but while various outlets now vie for the first post- " twerking " sitdown with @entity16 , let 's not forget that the biggest get of them all is still the exclusive property of @entity21 , who died saturday			2
his series of may 1977 interviews with former president @entity25 , revisited in the acclaimed 2008 feature film " @entity27 , " remains the @entity28 of all such face - offs			1
the interviews also built a major bridge -- since crossed many times -- between the worlds of showbiz and traditional " hard news			1
" against all odds and in the face of unyielding skepticism from " real journalists , " the man who once hosted " @entity41 " went toe - to - toe with @entity27 in his first interviews after resigning the presidency on august 9 , 1974			2
in largely pre-cable times , and three years before the launch of @entity0 , @entity21 paid $ 600,000 for @entity27 's time			1
that prompted the reigning @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 news divisions to reject @entity21 's advances rather than stoop to " checkbook journalism			2
" he was left to cobble together a network of independent stations in the @entity55 to broadcast the interviews , another precedent - shattering effort that far preceded @entity59 's 1986 syndicated ratings smash , " @entity60			0
" @entity21 's four taped 90 - minute interviews with @entity27 , which aired weekly , began with a may 4 , 1977 , program devoted to @entity64			1
and the widely perceived ladies ' man with the sugar - coated interview style came away with the ultimate trophy -- an apology after @entity27 's earlier burst of defiance			1
" i think unless you say it , you 're going to be haunted for the rest of your life , " @entity21 said , in search of an acknowledgment from @entity27 that he had betrayed the public trust			1
" i let the @entity55 people down , and i have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life , " @entity27 said -- after earlier leaving @entity83 open - mouthed with the assertion that " when the president does it , that means it is not illegal			2
" news : @entity21 , veteran @entity89 broadcaster , dies at 74 i re-watched the " @entity27 " movie monday night , and was re-impressed by the performances of @entity93 and @entity94 in the title roles			1
although some dramatic license was taken , director @entity96 pretty much crystallized the initial perception of @entity21 in an early exchange between @entity94 's @entity27 and his agent , @entity101 ( played by @entity102 )			1
" doing it with @entity21 would be a whole lot easier than doing it with @entity109 , " @entity101 tells @entity27 , who also hoped to use the interview to publicize the publication of his memoirs			1
" it would , " @entity27 agrees			2
" but it would have a lot less credibility			0
" but @entity101 says they 'd be paid a lot more by @entity21			2
and so the deal was sealed			0
the @entity119 , then in his early years as " @entity117 ' " most famous bulldog , had an entertainment background himself as the host of several 1950s game shows			0
but he seemed to view @entity21 as an inferior during their at - times - combative " @entity117 " interview			2
it aired shortly before @entity21 's first 90 - minute program with @entity27			1
in an excerpt from their real - life exchange , @entity21 tells @entity109 that he hoped for a " cascade of candor " from the former president			1
" a cascade of candor from president @entity27 ? is this what you expect ? " @entity109 shoots back			1
" no , " says @entity21			0
" it was just a phrase that i thought would appeal to you			0
" @entity109 later tells frost point - blank that @entity27 is " hardly going to confess on the air anything about @entity64			1
" he has a book coming out , so " why would he give it to you ? " @entity109 's underlying implication is that he would have been able to pry a mea culpa out of @entity27 , while an amateur showman such as @entity21 would be unequal to that task			1
but @entity21 holds his ground , telling @entity109 that " a lot more facts " about @entity64 are now known			1
and that @entity27 " realizes if he misses this opportunity , no one 's going to buy the book anyway			0
" @entity21 and @entity27 clashed on @entity64 in the last of their taped sessions , although the @entity64 segment ended up airing first			2
it drew a reported 45 million viewers , easily outdrawing rival programming on @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity21 went on to interview a succession of @entity89 prime ministers , in addition to former president @entity163 and , in 1992 , maverick presidential candidate @entity164 for a @entity165 special			1
@entity164 proved to be perhaps even pricklier than @entity27 , telling @entity21 , " everything you 've just said is incorrect " after his interviewer suggested he had problems " dealing with equals			2
" @entity21 later told me his encounter with @entity164 was " a very refreshing experience , " although he would have to " acclimatize himself to being challenged			0
" @entity175 and @entity176 , @entity21 continued to mix and match , lending his name to political satire ( " @entity182 " after his earlier mid- 1960s tenure as host of @entity50 's " @entity183 " ) ; game shows ( " @entity21 presents @entity185 " ) ; and entertainment specials ( " @entity187 of @entity188 " )			0
but in the end he 'll largely be remembered as a one - hit wonder who , 36 years ago , changed the face of television by doing it his way			0
he came , he saw , he conquered			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity198 : the late @entity21 owned the first " big get " interview : @entity25
he says it bridged showbiz and " hard news , " though some questioned his journalistic cred
he says @entity21 drew apology from @entity27 ; @entity109 *doubted* he could do it
bark : @entity21 would interview others -- @entity216 , @entity163 -- but the @entity27 " get " is his legacy
