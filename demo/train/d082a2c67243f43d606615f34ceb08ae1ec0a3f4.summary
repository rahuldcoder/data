-- ecological and conservation groups are praising a move by the @entity3 to impose new restrictions on rat poisons to help reduce the threat of accidental exposure to children and wildlife			1
the rules say only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees can buy rat poison in bulk			1
" we are very happy that the @entity3 has done all it can to get these products off of the consumer market , " said @entity16 , director of conservation advocacy for the @entity18			1
" by putting these restrictions in place , they are allowing a compromise to be made between themselves and organizations who have been working on this problem for a long time			2
" the @entity3 's new measures , which were handed down thursday , require that rat poisons be kept in bait stations above ground and in containers that meet agency standards			1
loose bait , such as pellets , and the four most hazardous types of pesticides , known as " second - generation anticoagulants , " will no longer be sold for personal use			1
under the new restrictions , only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees will be allowed to purchase rat poison in bulk			1
bags larger than 8 pounds will no longer be sold at hardware and home - improvement stores			2
children who come into contact with highly toxic pellets can experience terrible symptoms from digesting them			1
they include internal bleeding , nosebleeds , hair loss and extensive bruising			0
between 2001 and 2003 , rat poison was responsible for nearly 60,000 poisonings , according to a study done by the @entity59			1
about 250 of these yearly exposures result in serious injuries or death			0
the @entity3 said it believes the restrictions will not only keep the products out of children 's hands , but also reduce the ecological and wildlife risks associated with exposure to rat poison			1
bait blocks that are typically placed on the ground use fish and other flavors that attract endangered species , including mountain lions			1
" in @entity77 , almost every animal tested by the @entity76 had residues of rodenticides , " said @entity16			0
" the rat baits are also very lethal to scavengers , because the toxins remain in the rodent 's body long after they initially die			2
" although the @entity3 is receiving considerable praise for the initiative , this is n't the first time the agency has worked to combat the threat of rat poison			1
in 1998 , the @entity3 established two standards for rat poison			1
the agency required manufacturers to include an ingredient that made the poison taste bitter and use an indicator dye that would make the ingestion of pesticides more recognizable			2
but regulations were revoked in 2001 after the agency came to a mutual agreement with manufacturers to rescind the requirements			0
" we determined that the dye was n't effective in keeping children from being accidentally exposed and the bittering agent actually resulted in a loss of efficiency in controlling rodents , " said @entity106 , director of the agency 's @entity107 and re-registration			0
" in our decision thursday , we felt that we needed an approach that would stop children coming in contact with the pesticides in the first place			0
that ultimately led to the implementation of bait stations , " @entity106 said			0
the decision to revoke the requirements led the @entity128 and the @entity129 to file a lawsuit three years later			0
both organizations saw the retraction as a way to make it easy for consumers to purchase unsafe rodenticides over the counter			0
according to the @entity142 group , inner - city housing and park departments such as the @entity140 could continue laying rat baits in public areas that were easily accessible to children			2
" studies show that the number of poisonings in minority children is much higher than others , " said @entity146 , a staff attorney at the @entity129			0
" not only do we have an environmental health issue , but an environmental justice issue as well			0
" @entity156 studies showed that 57 percent of children hospitalized for rat poisoning were black and 26 percent were @entity159			2
the @entity3 said it is working to reduce those numbers in upcoming years with regulations like the ones it introduced this week			1
" we were frustrated that the @entity3 dragged their feet for three years before finally taking some productive steps , " said @entity146			2
" but , from our perspective , they are finally starting to do what needs to be done in order to protect children			0
" after june 4 , rat poison manufacturers will have 90 days to comply with the @entity3 's guidelines			1
they will then have the opportunity to design new bait stations and formulas for their poisons			0
all new products should be registered and certified by june 2011 .			0
