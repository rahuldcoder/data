@entity0 -- there 's good news for drivers hitting the road this @entity6 weekend : gas prices are falling			1
regular unleaded dropped to a national average of $ 3.71 per gallon this week , 23 cents below an april high of $ 3.94 , according to the federal government			1
but will less pain at the pump undercut @entity15 attacks against president @entity16 ? the answer is unclear			1
earlier this year , there was rampant speculation that national gas prices could top $ 5 or even $ 6 per gallon			1
republicans seized on the issue , sensing new political vulnerability for the president			0
" @entity27 families and small businesses are continuing to struggle , and one of their big struggles these days is the rising price of gas , " house speaker @entity24 , @entity25 , said in february			0
" if the president 's serious about working with ( @entity15 ) to expand energy production in @entity27 and to deal with the rising oil prices , it 's time for him to lay his cards on the table			1
" in march , presumptive @entity15 presidential nominee @entity39 called on @entity16 to fire the heads of the @entity41 , the @entity42 and the @entity43 , blaming them for earlier price spikes			1
@entity46 : how to take long holiday from high gas prices republicans also bitterly criticized @entity16 's decision last winter to temporarily block an extension of the controversial @entity53 oil pipeline , which would stretch from @entity55 's tar sands to the @entity56			1
@entity15 leaders call it a blown opportunity to create jobs and cut prices			2
now , gas prices are trending down , but republicans are n't yielding on the issue			1
@entity66 majority leader @entity65 , @entity67 , spent friday touring an offshore oil drilling platform in the @entity56 , a not - too - subtle way of criticizing the administration 's energy development policy			1
the @entity72 is holding two hearings next week to keep up the drumbeat			0
one of the hearings , according to a committee news release , will " examine administration policies and regulations that hinder the production and use of oil , natural gas , and coal as energy sources			0
" @entity1 on friday asked @entity85 , a spokesman for @entity87 minority leader @entity86 , @entity88 , whether declining gas prices are blunting the @entity15 's political message			1
" we have n't stopped talking about it , because the need to solve the problem is still there , " @entity85 said			0
" this administration is hostile to domestic energy production			0
... i do n't think you 'll find anyone out there who thinks that , even at $ 3.70 a gallon on average , that it 's no longer something to work on			0
" top democrats on @entity106 were skeptical of the @entity15 's ability to gain traction on the issue			2
" on gas prices , i would say ... that yes , ( the @entity15 's ) attempts to capitalize on gas prices have fizzled , " said a senior @entity87 @entity111 leadership aide who asked not to be identified			1
" but even before prices went down , i think the @entity15 ' attempts to exploit the issue was coming off as pure politics and thus not gaining much traction anyway			2
" a @entity1 / @entity119 survey from late march , when gas prices were still rising , showed serious public concern over the issue			1
roughly one in five @entity27 called pump pain the most important issue facing the country ; seven in 10 said higher gas prices had caused hardship for them			1
there were indications , however , that political fallout from rising gas prices was limited			2
the poll showed that most @entity27 blamed oil companies for the price increases , not the @entity16 administration			2
congressional republicans received almost as much blame as the @entity66 , and foreign oil - producing countries got more blame than politicians of either party			0
" republicans seemed to think they had a big weapon to use against @entity16			0
now , it 's not so clear that they will , " said @entity1 polling director @entity143			0
" @entity27 do n't worry about gas prices as much as they worry about gas shortages			2
the energy crises of the 1970s that arguably had some effect on elections were really due to long lines and rationing			0
if those return for any reason , @entity16 would face a big problem			0
but if prices are high and gasoline is still easy to acquire , the public would probably not view that as a crisis			0
" oil industry experts argue that politicians , including the president , have a very limited ability to affect short term prices one way or the other			1
@entity172 , chief oil analyst for the @entity174 - based @entity173 , said the recent price drop is due primarily to investors misreading the global oil market earlier this year , less recent focus on the nuclear standoff with @entity169 and @entity171 's economic woes			2
policy changes such as increased domestic drilling would n't affect prices " one way or the other " right now , @entity172 said			0
changes to automobile mileage standards or @entity56 drilling permits could affect prices in about five to 10 years , he estimated			0
" nobody can take credit ( for the short - term changes ) , and nobody can take blame , " he said			1
@entity1 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

gas prices have dropped 23 cents per gallon since peaking in april
it 's unclear whether the drop will *undermine* @entity15 attacks against @entity16 's energy policy
industry experts say politicians *deserve* little credit or blame for short - term price changes
