-- in this election season , @entity1 and @entity2 have been touting the importance of family and hard work that make @entity7 a land of opportunity			1
@entity9 has talked about his father 's love and rise from odd - job laborer to successful businessman			2
president @entity15 has spoken of how his grandparents worked industriously to go to college , buy a house and raise their children			0
while triumphant stories of middle - class families make for good campaign speeches , the truth is far less heartening			0
@entity7 's policies to support workers and families are worse than any other country in the developed world and hardly better than some in the developing world			1
take , for example , family leave policies			1
until 1993 , @entity7 had no guaranteed leave time from work whatsoever			1
if you needed to take time off to care for a dying family member , there was not much you could have done to stop employers from firing you			0
with the passage of the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) , @entity7 were guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year			1
however , because it is unpaid , workers who do not have sufficient income can not take advantage of the leave			0
opinion : the true difference between @entity15 , @entity9 in addition , the law only applies to workers who have been with a current employer for more than a year and who work at companies with more than 50 employees			2
even if workers could afford it , fewer than half of those without a high school education are covered and eligible to take unpaid leave			0
likewise , when it comes to policies affecting new parents , @entity7 has no federal law mandating paid maternity leave			1
there are only a handful of other countries that also do not guarantee new mothers paid leave , the wealthiest of which is @entity73			2
in 2011 , @entity73 had a gdp of nearly $ 13 billion , while the @entity7 had a gdp of $ 15 trillion			2
our gdp is more than 1,000 times that of the next richest country with no federal paid maternity leave			1
no wonder some believe that the @entity7 has " the most family - hostile public policy " in the developed world			1
we fall short of our status as an advanced nation in other ways , too , like in the amount of vacation time that employers are legally required to give to employees every year			0
nearly 160 countries offer paid vacation days to workers , with many countries providing two weeks or more			1
what about sick days ? again , we are far behind numerous other countries			1
the @entity7 government does not mandate any minimum amount of paid sick leave for workers			1
this puts us alone among similar advanced nations			0
we have only unpaid sick leave for those covered under @entity41 protections , and then it 's up to individual companies to determine their own polices toward sick leave			1
in our capitalist society , the task of providing necessary worker protections and family support has largely been left out of the hands of the government			2
benevolent employers took it upon themselves to provide benefits to workers			0
but this model of " welfare capitalism " has greatly diminished in recent years			0
it 's time for our government to re-evaluate its inaction			0
today , the family structure is changing rapidly in our country			0
more than 70 % of women with children younger than 18 are in the work force			0
more and more , both parents have to work full time to support a middle - class family			2
traditional models of balancing work and family commitments are badly out of date			0
opinion : republicans rick being the party of mean @entity7 has always been proud of its tradition of -- and belief in -- limited interference in the private sector			2
but our labor policies , especially as they apply to working families , are in dire need of updates			0
while the lack of federal work - family policies might be cheap and convenient for employers , there is no way that it 's any good for families in the 21st century			1
instead of just talking about helping families , politicians need to implement family - oriented policies to help working mothers and fathers , and those who need to take more than a few days off to help care for a sick child			1
whoever gets elected in november needs to take a hard look at the facts			0
our federal family policies certainly make @entity7 unique -- but not in the way we want			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

republicans and @entity2 say that family and hard work are *critical*
@entity171 : @entity7 's work - family policies are worse than many countries
he says the @entity7 lacks law on maternity leave , sick leave , vacation days
@entity171 : our government need to to implement family - oriented policies
