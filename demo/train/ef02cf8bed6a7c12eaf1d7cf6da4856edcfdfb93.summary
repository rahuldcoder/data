-- the @entity2 town of @entity3 boasts views of snow - capped mountains , a 15th - century castle , and a swimming pool for locals to bathe in -- but residents are in short supply			1
@entity11 has become a ghost town , a haunting reminder of the country 's continuing property crisis			1
@entity11 is saddled with € 16 million of debt , making it @entity2 's most indebted town			1
thousands of newly - built homes remain empty and vandalized years after they were built , other projects are simply unfinished and unpaid for			1
the town is in the municipality of @entity23 , just an hour 's drive from @entity25 , but commuters were n't lured in by the new - build homes			1
today , only 3,500 people live in these housing estates designed for 25,000			1
the @entity2 property boom went bust in 2007 , and now 20 % of @entity2 homes lie empty			1
the banking sector has € 186 billion - worth of troubled real estate assets on its books			1
it is easier to grasp the impact of these statistics when standing on a street in @entity3			0
row upon row of identical homes stand empty , complete with boarded - up windows , peeling plaster , hanging electrical cables and falling down " @entity47 " signs			1
at the heart of the town stands an iconic 15th - century castle ; despite the ravages of time it appears to be in better shape than many of the newer crumbling homes that surround it			2
however , looks can be deceiving			0
" it 's falling down , " said @entity57 , " we were thinking of doing some restoration work on it , but owing to the crisis it is not possible			2
we will leave it until one day when we can			0
" elsewhere in the town lie newer constructions : a € 1 million community swimming pool that had just one bather on @entity0 's visit , a € 500,000 medical center and a € 12 million sewage and water treatment plant , neither of which can be used due to lack of funds for running costs			1
according to @entity78 , the director of public works in @entity3 , the € 400,000 toxic waste plant , subsidized by the @entity81 and @entity82 , has problems that do n't stop at the running costs -- there is a dispute over who actually owns the land			2
" everything has been built on land which does n't even belong to the town hall , " he said			2
" fiasco ? as far as i know fiasco is when something breaks , like a natural disaster , this is something far greater -- this is utter madness			0
" @entity57 has been the mayor of @entity3 for just over a year , but since @entity0 visited has been ousted from office by the previous mayor @entity100 and six councilors			0
she hopes that future town planners and property developers will learn from their mistakes			2
" as the money came into the town hall , they did n't realize it would ever stop , " she said			0
" the good times do come to an end			0
we 'll go back to the good times , but for now we must wait			0
i hope this is a lesson for everyone			0
