-- the organization that grants academic accreditation to @entity4 has warned the school that it is in danger of losing that crucial status in the wake of the @entity10 child sex abuse scandal , the university announced this week			1
the move by the @entity12 is the latest blow for the beleaguered university , which has seen its reputation clobbered and its football program hobbled after investigators found school leaders did too little to stop the abuse			2
were the commission to pull @entity4 's accreditation -- which it has not done -- the school would face the loss of eligibility for federal student aid programs , guaranteed student loans , federal research grants and could lose eligibility for state aid , commission spokesman @entity20 said in july			1
@entity32 family wants to appeal @entity4 sanctions @entity4 will resolve the commission 's concerns , promised vice provost for academic affairs @entity37			1
" this action has nothing to do with the quality of education our students receive , " @entity37 said in a statement posted monday to the school 's website			1
" @entity12 is focusing on governance , integrity and financial issues related to information in the @entity52 report and other items related to our current situation			1
" the commission voted august 6 to place the school on warning status			0
two days later , it notified @entity4 officials that the school 's accreditation was " in jeopardy " based on information contained in former fbi director @entity52 's report on @entity4 's handling of the sex - abuse allegations against @entity10 and a @entity67 action against the school			1
@entity52 found that @entity4 's leadership showed " total and consistent disregard " for youths sexually abused by @entity10 , the former assistant football coach convicted by a jury in june on 45 counts involving child sex abuse			2
he is scheduled to be sentenced in september			0
among other things , authorities say school officials failed to properly address a report that @entity10 had been seen in a football complex shower , apparently engaged in sexual contact with a young boy			0
timeline of the @entity4 scandal last month , the @entity67 fined @entity4 $ 60 million , banned the football program from bowl games for four years , stripped scholarships and took away the team 's wins from 1998 to 2011			2
the commission also said it had insufficient evidence that @entity4 officials had followed commission rules about how schools are to be governed and whether it had provided " accurate , fair and complete information " about what was happening at the school , according to the letter			2
the commission asked @entity4 to report by september 30 on the steps it is taking to ensure full compliance with accreditation requirements , as well as information about the school 's financial capacity to meet ongoing obligations considering the potential fallout from civil lawsuits expected over the scandal			1
a team assembled by the commission will visit @entity4 after the september report to evaluate the school 's performance , the commission said			1
@entity37 said the commission " wants us to document that steps we have already taken and are planning to take will ensure our full compliance with its requirements " and emphasized that the school expects no loss of accreditation			0
" it is critical to emphasize that @entity12 does not issue a warning unless the commission believes that an institution has the capacity to make appropriate improvements within a reasonable period and then sustain itself to stay in compliance , " @entity37 said in the statement			0
" this certainly is true for @entity4			0
we 're confident that our monitoring report and the site visit will confirm this to the commission			0
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity138 said the warning seemed to be a bit of " piling on " in light of the sanctions already in place against @entity4			1
but it may be another factor to further motivate the university to comprehensively deal with the scandal , he said on @entity0 's " @entity148			0
" " it all creates pressure on @entity4 to make sure it has policies in place to make sure nothing like this ever happens again , " @entity138 said			0
