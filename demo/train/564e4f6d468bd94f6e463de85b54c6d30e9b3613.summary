@entity0 -- with @entity3 heading to the polls on saturday , concerns have been voiced about likely electoral irregularities			1
@entity6 , a former foreign minister and leading presidential candidate , has warned the ballot will be marred by " industrial scale fraud " to rival the 1 million votes that were disqualified in the 2009 elections			0
despite these concerns , and the prospect of @entity16 attacks at polling stations , the ballot is nonetheless a watershed moment in the country 's history			1
it heralds the first democratic transfer of power , and also the end of the post- 9/11 @entity25 era			0
some 13 years after the fall of the @entity16 regime , president @entity25 is bequeathing a mixed legacy			1
to be sure , there are grounds for optimism			0
since 2001 , for instance , the economy has grown rapidly , and women have more opportunities in much of the country			0
and as the election underlines , a nascent , albeit dysfunctional , democracy may be taking root after years of @entity16 oppression			1
but the most likely prospect is greater economic , political and security instability			0
and , this is despite the blood and treasure expended by @entity48 and @entity49 militaries since 2001 -- about 3,500 international coalition forces lives lost , and almost $ 700 billion spent by the @entity48 military alone			1
whether @entity3 prospers , or implodes , will be determined in part by the new president 's success in dealing with a complex set of inter-related issues including : trying to forge a security deal with @entity58 and its @entity60 partners beyond 2014 ; pursuing the reconciliation agenda and a possible peace agreement with the @entity16 ; and preventing an economic downturn as foreign aid is reduced			1
of the original 27 candidates approved by the @entity67 , only eight remain			0
yet the ballot outcome is uncertain , partly because of electoral fraud			2
as well as @entity6 , who finished second in the 2009 presidential election , the two other leading candidates are widely seen to be @entity72 , an economist and former @entity75 executive , and @entity76 , a former foreign minister			0
given the absence of an obvious front - runner , it appears likely no one will secure 50 % of the vote to win outright			0
thus , a run - off ballot would be required , delaying the outcome several more weeks			2
once elected , the priority for the new president will be bolstering domestic security , and @entity6 , @entity72 and @entity86 have endorsed the need for a long - term deal with @entity48 and @entity60 forces			1
however , to create the " political space " for what would be a controversial agreement with some of the populace , the new president will need to secure concessions from @entity58			2
this could mean protracted negotiations which will frustrate the @entity98 administration			0
while it is likely than a deal will be reached , there is a possibility that @entity48 and @entity60 forces may pull out completely in 2014			1
this could prove catastrophic for the new government , potentially leading to its eventual collapse			2
this is widely recognized internationally , but the military presence in @entity3 is unpopular in many @entity49 countries			2
moreover , delays in signing a deal ( @entity58 hoped to reach agreement last year with @entity25 ) means logistical and personnel complications of extending the international troop presence are growing			2
key issues to be resolved between the new president and @entity58 include : any continuing @entity48 mandate to perform counter-terrorism mission in @entity3 ; extending immunity for @entity48 military personnel ; and the fate of @entity16 prisoners			1
all of these are points where the new government will walk a tightrope between keeping @entity58 on side , while not torpedoing the peace dialogue with the @entity16			1
should a security deal be secured , a residual @entity48 and @entity60 force of 8,000 - 12,000 troops is most likely			1
importantly , this agreement would also ensure funding and training for @entity3 security forces which may otherwise disintegrate			1
however , @entity3 still faces the prospect of instability from a @entity16 counter-offensive			1
hence , the reason why another priority for the new president will be advancing reconciliation with the @entity16 toward a potential final settlement			2
@entity144 's influence could be key in facilitating any deal			0
while doubts remain about that country 's ability and willingness to facilitate such an agreement , last week @entity144 government representatives entered into formal peace talks with the @entity16 in @entity153			1
turning to the economic front , the new president will come into office at a difficult moment			0
since 2001 , the economy has become more dependent on foreign aid			0
economic risks would be intense in the event of a withdrawal of international troops			0
this could see aid cut back , partly because agencies would no longer be able to operate under an international security umbrella			0
another problem the new government faces is that there has been only limited success in economic diversification since 2001 , with the extractives sector the only exception			0
the clear danger is that , as aid is reduced , the economy becomes more dependent upon illegal drug exports such as opium and heroin			0
taken overall , @entity3 is therefore at a major inflexion point			2
a successful , decisive transfer of power combined with an eventual reconciliation deal with the @entity16 could consolidate power and legitimacy of the new president , helping preserve some of the fragile gains since 2001			0
but if international forces withdraw completely in 2014 , the eventual collapse of the government becomes a real possibility			1

if @entity48 - led forces withdraw completely in 2014 , collapse of government becomes probability , he adds
