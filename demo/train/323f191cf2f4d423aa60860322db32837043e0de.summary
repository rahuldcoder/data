-- scientists examining the 7,000 - year - old remains of a hunter - gatherer found in @entity4 have discovered that @entity6 versions of pigmentation genes determined his skin color , but that he had blue eyes now associated with northern @entity11			1
baptized " @entity12 1 " by scientists -- after the @entity12 - @entity16 site where his remains were found -- the man lived during the @entity19 period , which lasted from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago			1
the @entity19 hunter - gather period was followed by the @entity22 period and the advent of farming			0
as a result , @entity12 1 's diet differed from @entity22 man , and researchers said he had been lactose intolerant			2
" the biggest surprise was to discover that this individual possessed @entity6 versions in the genes that determine the light pigmentation of the current @entity11 , which indicates that he had dark skin , although we can not know the exact shade , " researcher @entity29 from the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) said			2
" even more surprising was to find that he possessed the genetic variations that produce blue eyes in current @entity11 , resulting in a unique phenotype in a genome that is otherwise clearly northern @entity11			1
" a genome is the full map of an individual 's dna			0
@entity12 1 's closest modern descendants , in genetic terms , live in northern @entity11 in places like @entity53 and @entity54			1
the research -- carried out by the @entity31 in partnership with @entity58 's @entity57 -- has been published in the scientific journal " nature			0
" @entity61 , archaeologist of the @entity62 , found and excavated the @entity12 - @entity16 site , near @entity64 , in 2006			0
scientists said the cave is located in a cold mountainous area with a steady temperature -- conditions that contributed to the " exceptional " preservation of the dna of @entity12 1 and the remains of another individual found there			2
researchers say they will now try to recover the genome of the second set of remains , which were not as well preserved .			0

remains of two *people* from @entity19 period were found in @entity4 in 2006
scientists **analyze** one of their genomes , found he had blue eyes and dark skin
@entity12 1 's closest modern descendants , in genetic terms , live in northern @entity11
scientists plan to **analyze** second individual 's remains , which less well preserved
