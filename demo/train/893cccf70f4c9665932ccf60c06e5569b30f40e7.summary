@entity1 , @entity0 -- " freedom ! " that word , yelled out in @entity5 , reverberated friday along the banks of the @entity7 in @entity1 -- as well as in the port city of @entity9 , near the canal in @entity11 , and other pockets of @entity0			1
many demonstrators voicing their desire for a new government and new political future remained on the streets well into saturday morning , defying a curfew and revelling in a historic day in a nation whose history dates back millennia			2
by early saturday , police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of @entity1 , with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades			1
they were ordered out by president @entity27 , whom many demonstrators were urging to step down or , at least , institute dramatic economic and political reforms			1
" we want ( @entity35 ) to leave , " said @entity31 , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity			0
" his time is over , " the 19 - year - old law student said early saturday from @entity37 in central @entity9			1
@entity27 has been in power for 30 years , during which time @entity0 has established itself as one of the most important powers in the region and a strong ally of the @entity45			1
at the same time , the long - time ruler and his regime had a reputation for restricting freedoms and staunchly holding onto power			0
resistance in the past had often been stifled by either political manuevering or the police , members of which were out in full force this week			0
but rarely have they met an opposition force as large , or as apparently determined			0
" police have always been violent , but we have n't seen it this way , " @entity59 , a reporter for @entity60 who has been posting regular developments on @entity63 , told @entity2 's @entity64			2
" we have n't seen this many people on the streets at the same time			2
" video footage from friday showed throngs of protesters charging down a bridge over the @entity7 in @entity1 , overrunning police trucks that fired off tear gas with minimal effect			1
elsewhere , demonstrators torched and ransacked the headquarters of @entity27 's ruling @entity78			1
when protesters circled the @entity80 in @entity1 on friday , they were greeted by police , who responded with sharp cracks of gunfire			1
it 's not clear whether police shot at protesters or into the air , whether their bullets were rubber or steel , whether anyone was wounded or killed			1
there were many other reports of run - ins , and the @entity95 reporting early friday that the government had arrested more than 1,000 people , including political opposition leader @entity98			0
@entity99 , a resident of the @entity101 neighborhood of @entity1 , said that he and fellow demonstrators had been " beaten and assaulted by police " since monday , when the popular unrest began			1
continuing to fight friday , he said that his group had beaten back police , who retreated			0
later he claimed , protesters set fire to three police stations and about 20 police cars			2
" we went out today and we were ready to die , so our children can live in dignity , " said @entity99			0
protesters ' interactions with @entity0 's military -- members of an army that is widely respected in @entity0 -- were far more friendly			1
in @entity1 and @entity9 , many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers , some even shaking hands with soldiers			1
@entity99 , the @entity1 resident , said he and fellow demonstrators celebrated when they saw troops roll into town , and they were not alone			1
" it means we are victorious , " he said			0
" if the army comes out , that means the government ... is no longer in control			0
" in the wee hours of saturday , with the curfew ostensibly in effect , people continued to come up to friendly army troops , greeting them and posing for pictures by tanks			0
some military personnel were stationed outside burned out police stations , but did little to prevent people from going into them and coming out with chairs , tables and various valuables			2
the army was n't the only side exercising restraint			0
the @entity148 sent its followers onto the streets after friday prayers , the first time @entity0 's large and venerable -- but illegal -- @entity153 opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations			2
and when younger @entity148 protesters seemed ready to hurl rocks at the police in @entity9 , @entity0 's second - largest city , older men put their arms around their shoulders , calming them down			1
just after midnight saturday , @entity27 gave a speech defending and explaining the government 's response to the protests while saying that he 'd soon form a new government mindful of the demonstrators ' demands for policy changes			1
still that did n't appease many on the streets , who vowed to continue demonstrating again against what they felt was an unjust ruling government that needed a fresh start -- without @entity27			2
" we are one of the richest @entity183 countries , and we want to live , " said a 20 - year - old student named @entity99 , whose last name was withheld to protect his identity , from @entity9			0
" let a new government form , but if we do n't get what we ask for , we will go back to the streets again and again			0
" another protester in @entity9 , an 18 - year - old taxi driver named @entity189 , did n't even think the entrenched @entity0 ruler deserved even that much of a chance			2
he said @entity0 should press on with their protests , following the lead of their fellow @entity195 nation @entity196			0
there , president @entity198 @entity197 left the country after 23 years in power following weeks of demonstrations against his rule			0
the new government , under prime minister @entity206 , announced new freedoms and promised to institute numerous democratic - minded reforms			0
" they kept protesting until he fled the country , " @entity189 said of @entity196			0
" we will do more and more , we will continue our demonstrations , and we will do 3,000 times more of what the @entity196 did			2
" @entity2 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 in @entity1 and @entity218 in @entity9 contributed to this report .			1
