-- two music faculty members at @entity3 have been placed on administrative leave due to hazing allegations related to the marching band , university officials said			1
the university investigation follows the high - profile suspected hazing death of @entity3 band member @entity10 in november , but the cases are unrelated			1
faculty members @entity12 and @entity14 were placed on leave effective wednesday because of " allegations of misconduct and / or incompetence involving reports and allegations of hazing within the @entity22 , ' " according to the university			1
the @entity24 is the university 's nationally recognized band			2
@entity12 is an associate professor and director of clarinets and saxophones , and @entity14 is an assistant professor for euphonium and tuba			0
the pair will receive pay while on leave , the university said			1
the university did not disclose details of the investigation , but said the hazing allegations stem from an off - campus incident in 2010			1
@entity41 police conducted a separate investigation into the allegations against @entity12 and @entity14 , but the case was closed last week after the state of @entity46 decided it would not pursue criminal charges because it could not prove that hazing occurred and because the statute of limitations likely expired			1
the police report , however , sheds some light on the allegations and the difficulty authorities face when investigating such incidents			1
many students police sought as witnesses refused to cooperate or retained lawyers			2
according to the police report , the incident happened sometime in the spring of 2010 , but was not reported to @entity3 police until november 2011 , and did not reach @entity41 police until january of this year			1
in the wake of @entity68 's death , a band student and member of the @entity65 fraternity confided in a professor that he was involved in a hazing incident at @entity12 's home			2
the professor informed band director @entity73 , who went to police			0
the student told police that the pledges at @entity12 's house were hit on their bodies and necks , and that they were paddled with " a very thick piece of wood			0
" he offered details and said he suffered bruising on his buttocks from the paddling , but told police that he had no desire to press charges			0
" he stated he wanted to be there and go through the ritual so he could become a @entity65 member , " the police report says			1
the student told the police this over the phone			0
when the authorities tried to set up an in - person interview , the student 's mother called to protest , saying her son would not give a statement			0
when police reached out to other potential witnesses who were there the day of the alleged hazing , the response that often came back was that they could n't remember the incident or would have to contact a lawyer before speaking			2
according to the police report , some of the witnesses relented and spoke with police , but only after subpoenas were issued			1
the students offered conflicting accounts in which some admitted there was some hitting , but no blows that caused injury			0
some said @entity12 was present during the hitting , and others said he was not			0
some witnesses said @entity14 was also at the house			0
no one admitted to having witnessed paddling			0
@entity12 himself was questioned by police , and said he told the fraternity members not to hit " in the face and do n't paddle			0
" however , according to the police report , he said paddling may have happened outside or in the garage			1
he denied that he did anything resulting in bodily harm , but said , " it 's possible to say that i did do something under the circumstances ... maybe i did do something			0
" according to @entity3 president @entity144 , once the university 's investigation is complete , it " will take appropriate action against faculty members or students , up to and including dismissals			2
