-- for foreign executives , doing business for the first time in @entity3 can be a bewildering experience			1
there 's the new -- different business customs , bureaucracy and the dizzying scale of the population -- but also the familiar			1
" you 'll likely be dealing with people who speak the @entity17 's @entity16 , and who graduated from top @entity20 universities , " said @entity11 , a management professor at the @entity13 's @entity12			2
" you can get lulled into a false sense of security -- " but for people dressing a little different and talking a little different , they are just like me , ' " he said			0
" that 's a completely false premise			2
there are all kinds of nuances in the culture , implicit cultural norms that we do n't know about until we run afoul of them			0
" as the world 's second most populous nation , with more than one billion people , @entity3 is projected to become one of its biggest economies			1
it is tipped by @entity42 to nearly draw level with the @entity44 by 2050			0
" for companies with any kind of global interest , the writing is on the wall that they need to have a strategy for @entity3 , " said @entity11			1

" one of the common pitfalls in addressing the @entity3 marketplace is simply dusting off something you might offer in your home market , " he said			1
" @entity3 consumers are very different -- enormously value conscious and very , very finicky			1
" holding to too high a price point could be fatal for foreign businesses , as @entity3 consumers have less capacity to pay than @entity20 consumers			1
but by making their products affordable to the mass market , businesses put them within reach of hundreds of millions of potential consumers			2
the companies that fare best in the @entity3 market are those that customize their products to the particular preferences of @entity3 consumers , according to @entity11			1
a case in point was the success of @entity88 auto manufacturers , he said			0
" in the @entity90 , it 's almost unheard of to have a driver , " said @entity11			1
" but in @entity3 , labor markets being what they are , you can get a full time driver for a relatively modest wage , and even with a small car , you may want a chauffeur			1
this will clearly have ramifications for the design of the car -- the customer wants more space in the back			0
" business practices are also different in @entity3 , and many foreign businesses underestimate the bureaucratic hurdles they will encounter , according to @entity108 , associate @entity109 at @entity111 and co-author of " @entity113 in @entity3 : building research - based practice			1
" the secret , he said , was to factor in a realistic amount of time for delays			1
" if the website of the ministry says it will take 13 weeks to get the required certificate , it 's not realistic it will take 13 weeks , " he said			2
@entity108 said that often the reason for the bottlenecks was bureaucrats expecting a pay off			0
" that 's why they 're delaying things , although no one will say this out loud , " he said			2
" if you have a local player , they can perhaps better handle local dynamics like this			2
" @entity108 said that within " modern sectors " such as @entity141 , software and pharmaceuticals , and developed business enclaves such as those in @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 , levels of professionalism were often in line with international business expectations			0
" people will stick to meeting times , deadlines , promises ; they will mean business , " he said			0
but he added that dealing with the public sector and trade unions could be a different story			0

" the @entity44 is a much more transaction - oriented society , " he said			0
" when you 're doing business , you 're there to talk about a particular transaction , and you either do it or you do n't			0
but @entity3 business is still very much relationship - based			1
sometimes being too transaction - oriented can be not a smart way to go			0
" @entity11 's advice ? " do a lot of homework and figure out who might be the right people to deal with			0
there 's a very tight network at the top of @entity3 business , and you need to get access to that network in order to succeed			1
finding the right partners can be key , but you need to be diligent			0
" @entity108 said the key to succeeding in @entity3 was to be prepared by tapping into the networks and resources that can provide information on the subject , thereby going in with realistic expectations			2
" have persistence , and do n't give up , " he said			0
" the mileage to get into @entity3 is great			2
do n't expect it to be a smooth ride , expect it to be irritating			0
but once you 're there , you 'll enjoy it -- and you 'll make a lot of money as well			0

@entity3 is projected to become one of the world 's biggest economies in coming decades
experts say its business practices are very different from the @entity90
to succeed in @entity3 , products need to be *specifically* tailored to the local consumer
plenty of time needs to be factored in for bureaucratic delays
