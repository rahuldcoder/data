-- being in the @entity1 is a bit like being a @entity4 banker or a pop star -- the job title comes with a laundry list of assumptions			1
if you 've made it into the pros , then you must be not only physically elite and athletically talented , but also ridiculously wealthy and secure in a life the rest of us could only dream about ... right ? well , not exactly , as burgeoning filmmaker @entity15 seeks to reveal in his first feature film , " @entity17			1
" the indie , which premiered at @entity23 this year and has racked up accolades on the film festival circuit , follows a 25 - year - old pro football player who finds himself back at home , cash - strapped and trying to find his place in the world after his athletic career ends			1
the film 's inspired by @entity15 's own experience as a former @entity1 player , and the 30 - year - old director / writer / producer hopes his feature directorial debut will educate audiences			1
" a lot of people , they look at the guys who sign the big contracts -- the @entity39 , the @entity40 , the @entity41 -- and i think that what ends up happening is that people automatically assume it 's like that for every player , " @entity15 said			1
" and i think a lot of times people compare it to basketball and baseball contracts			2
in the @entity1 , there 's no guaranteed contract			1
" for example , upon exiting the @entity54 in 2004 with a degree focused on radio / tv broadcast and media production , @entity15 said he signed a three - year deal that allowed around $ 225,000 his first year year and escalated to $ 350,000 in his third -- but he ended up getting cut during training camp			1
" what happens is that if you get cut at any point , they only owe you what they paid you , " he explained			2
" when i got cut they reassigned me to the practice squad , and when i was on the practice squad , that base salary was $ 80,000			0
" " after taxes and everything else , it 's roughly $ 30,000 ( to ) $ 40,000 , " he said			0
" i 'm in the @entity1 , and people were thinking that i 'm making all of this crazy dough , and it ended up being like , maybe a couple thousand a week			1
but it 's only for those 16 weeks of that season			0
it was really hard to even make that stretch out for a year , let alone to put it in savings for years to come			0
" so when he was released from the league , a then 25 - year - old @entity15 had to figure out how to rebound			1
the answer seemed obvious : to pursue a longstanding passion for movies			0
" the reality of it is , in regards to playing ball , i could probably still be playing in @entity90 somewhere , or doing arena football , or something , " he said			0
" but i did n't want to live that life that i was living for the past three years for another seven			0
" he picked up and moved to @entity94 around 2007 after gaining acceptance to an organization called streetlights , which helps place minority men and women on sets as production assistants			0
at first , his transition to his new life left him shell - shocked as he tried to adjust from being a football player to being the humble @entity106 fetching coffee			2
@entity15 treated his production assistant gig like film school , soaking in all he could			1
he also used equipment made available to him to gain experience as a music video director			2
" every artist that charted , i cross-referenced it on @entity116 , and the artists that did n't have music videos for songs that were charting , i wrote them a message on @entity122 , " @entity15 said			1
the aspiring director offered a full music video treatment to musicians with no charge , just to get experience			2
after reaching out to several artists over the span of a few months , @entity15 began to make inroads in the music industry			1
he served as second assistant director on videos for artists including @entity135 and @entity136			0
but while his career as a director was taking shape , it was n't until he was shooting an independent documentary about the @entity1 lockout in 2011 that the idea for " @entity17 " hit him			1
" we were interviewing all these different fans , and we were asking people : ' who do you blame , the players or the owners ? ' and everyone blamed the players , surprisingly , " @entity15 said			1
" saying they 're greedy , what do i care these guys get $ 8 million , $ 9 million , calling them arrogant			0
i found myself defending these players and educating people and opening their eyes to that process , and i thought wow , maybe there 's something here			2
" he began writing the screenplay , his first , last march , and approached @entity162 ( " @entity163 , " " @entity164 " ) to play the lead			1
by july , they were embarking on a 15 - day shoot			0
" the biggest goal that we wanted to do with the film is to show that these guys are human beings , " @entity15 said			1
" with so many people , they just look at them like , ' oh , he 's just a piece of meat			0
he dropped a pass , let 's kill him			0
he 's an idiot , he gets cut -- whatever , he sucked anyway			0
to make it to the league , nobody sucks			0
" @entity162 , who 's also an executive producer on " @entity17 , " was taken from the moment he read the script			1
and as an actor , @entity162 understood the fear of failure that comes with constantly placing one 's fate in the hands of higher - ups			1
to get this far , " it took a lot of hard work , knocking down doors , making sure that i was at the right auditions , working with the right people , " he said			0
" you get what you work for			0
" yet the biggest hurdle for the film 's director was n't a professional obstacle but a personal one , as @entity15 faced the devastating unexpected passing of his mother last may			1
" the day before my mother passed , i wrote her a message			0
similar to the character in the movie , we really did n't talk that much , we were n't super-duper close			0
i just kind of felt compelled to hit her up , " he said			0
he thanked her for helping to support him financially , and told her he loved her			0
and in the last line of his e-mail , he added that he was " working on something big , and that if it goes well , hopefully i 'd be able to buy her that house that i was n't able to buy her back when i was playing ball			0
" @entity15 's mother responded , and the next day after their exchange , she died at 57 of a heart attack			2
that , he said , was really what pushed him to see " @entity17 " through			2
at the time , @entity15 said , " @entity17 " was going to be " ultra-low - budget			1
" after his mother passed , he was able to use most of her life insurance money to co-finance the project along with executive producer ( and @entity1 player ) @entity237			1
" in a way , " @entity15 said , his mother " sacrificed herself so that i can live out a dream			2
" unfortunately , that was just the first challenge for @entity15			2
ten minutes following their last @entity23 screening , @entity15 received word that his father , who 'd been in poor health , had also died			2
with his first movie bowing in theatrical release in @entity94 today and headed for @entity253 release on january 15 , @entity15 's already working on his next projects , one of which will revisit the world of football			2
" you definitely have to have a strong faith in @entity259 to try to get through , because this filmmaking thing , this is 10 times harder than trying to make it into @entity1 , " @entity15 said			1
it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life			0

former @entity1 player @entity15 is a rising filmmaker
his first feature film is *loosely* based on his own experience
" @entity17 " stars @entity162 , who sees the film as " a love story "
@entity15 hopes it will educate audiences and humanize players
