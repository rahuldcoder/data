it 's been three years since i reported on the plight of the @entity4 people of western @entity5 and neighboring @entity6			1
we called our documentary " a @entity18 , " and it looked at appalling incidents where boatloads of refugees fleeing poverty and persecution arrived in @entity15 only to be towed back out to sea and abandoned by the @entity15 security forces			1
hundreds died or went missing			2
watch : the @entity18 : part 1 part 2 part 3 since then , the @entity21 have remained off the political agenda in western countries			2
but now that 's changing			1
@entity26 president @entity25 addressed their plight during his recent visit to @entity30			1
the lukewarm response he got in the auditorium was nothing to the vitriol he got online			2
even mentioning the name @entity21 is controversial for some in @entity5			1
we have come to @entity39 to report on the latest threat to the @entity21			2
what we have found is shocking			2
the @entity21 are among the most persecuted people on the planet			2
in both @entity5 and @entity6 -- where they have a deep - rooted heritage dating back to when it was known as @entity47 -- they are not officially citizens and are denied passports , access to health - care , education and decent jobs			1
each country claims the @entity21 is the other 's problem			1
in july this year , the @entity6 government ordered three international aid organizations to stop helping @entity21 who were crossing the border from @entity5			1
in @entity5 , their perilous situation has become markedly worse in recent months			1
mobs of @entity65 extremists have been torching whole @entity21 villages			1
hundreds have died and more than 100,000 people have been forced to flee , according to humanitarian groups			1
but there is nowhere for them to go			2
so driven by fear many are congregating in huge makeshift camps on the edge of the @entity75 town of @entity76			1
i was expecting the camps to be grim -- but i was n't prepared to see children starving to death			1
this is n't journalistic hyperbole			2
the two western doctors working unofficially here have watched several children perish before their eyes -- not from a rare tropical disease or an untreated chronic condition , but simply from malnutrition			0
i find it sickening and outrageous that this is happening in a land of plentiful food in 2012			0
perhaps i am na√Øve or too idealistic			0
i should probably know better , i should have seen enough of the world 's misery and violence to be unaffected by a wide - eyed kid too fatigued to swat the flies from her eyes			1
but this one broke my heart			0
an assessment in august by @entity102 found that " 2,000 acutely malnourished children who were at a high risk of mortality			0
" thousands of kids like @entity107 are starving to death			1
international aid agencies are beginning to wake up to the scale of the problem			0
the @entity112 has just launched an appeal for us $ 41 million			0
tents , wells and latrines have been installed in some of the camps , but according to @entity102 , camp facilities are " unacceptable and fall well below international standards " and " are a direct manifestation of a funding gap			1
" they say water and sanitation facilities in particular are " wholly inadequate , resulting in life - threatening illnesses			0
" many @entity21 are surviving on a cup of rice each day and little else			0
it 's not enough for breast - feeding mothers to sustain their babies			1
it 's not enough for adults			1
it 's not enough for little @entity133 , whose skeletal body is as light as a doll 's			1
she looks like a famine victim but she is starving to death in a camp surrounded by paddy fields full of rice			0
there 's a busy market a couple of miles away , but her mother is effectively imprisoned here			1
this is a man - made crisis that could be ended immediately , with political will			0
i asked @entity152 's age , thinking that she looked like a toddler			1
my own daughter is three and is considerably larger , so i guess perhaps she was two			0
i was appalled when her mother told me @entity152 is five - years old			0
in the west , she 'd be in her first year of school			0
here , she could be in the last year of her life			0
she 's so thin she can barely walk			1
her limbs are pitifully emaciated			0
after six months in this camp , she looks like she ca n't go on			0
the doctors have not been given visas to help here , so they can only get the most basic supplies			0
the @entity5 government is reluctant to allow aid workers to help people who do n't officially exist			1
but the reality is that there are an estimated one million @entity21 in @entity5 and at least a tenth of them have been driven from their homes			1
yet driving around @entity76 , away from the camps , you rarely see a @entity21 in the town center			1
when we asked a @entity21 driver to bring us back from the camps to our hotel to sort out a problem with our camera , the hotel manager was furious			2
he told us in no uncertain terms not to use a @entity4 driver again and said people had seen the driver come into the hotel and had complained			1
it is apartheid of the most extreme form			0
near @entity192 , which sits amid several @entity21 villages and camps , @entity21 on foot , bicycle or scooter are forced to pull off the road when @entity198 students are leaving classes			1
sharing the same stretch of tarmac as a @entity21 is unacceptable for many @entity202 ; heaven forbid a @entity21 should attempt to board the same bus or eat in the same restaurant			0
@entity206 is the last neighborhood of @entity21 living inside the town of @entity76 ; the rest of population is now under canvas or tarps out in the countryside			2
this island of @entity21 houses is now effectively a ghetto surrounded by barbed wire			0
the soldiers that patrol the area are supposed to protect the @entity21 from further attacks by hostile locals , but videos taken by @entity21 purportedly showing an outbreak of violence in @entity206 in june show the troops doing little to put out fires set in @entity21 homes			0
the @entity21 fear more attacks here , but can do little to stop the gangs of extremists who they say were orchestrated by a local @entity39 nationalist party			0
the spokesman for that party denies involvement , but has open contempt for the @entity21 , flinching when i even mention the term			0
he says it 's a recently made up word , and that the @entity21 are simply @entity239 from neighboring @entity6			2
he does n't just want to kick all @entity21 out			0
he wants all @entity240 out of @entity241 , including officially recognized ethic groups like the @entity243			1
the anti-muslim sentiment has spread across @entity5 , with protests outside a mosque in the main city of @entity30			1
the @entity249 report on the situation is deeply worrying , while @entity251 has also completed some important work , highlighting the atrocities , with satellite photos showing the vast areas of destruction			0
what has disappointed many is that @entity260 laureate and pro-democracy leader @entity261 took a long time to speak out clearly to uphold @entity21 rights and condemn the extremists			0
she recently told @entity267 broadcaster @entity265 : " violence is something i condemn completely , but do n't forget that violence has been committed by both sides			0
this is why i prefer not to take sides and also i want to work towards reconciliation between these two communities			0
i 'm not going to be able to do that if i 'm going to take sides			0
" @entity261 elaborated further , saying : " there 's a quarrel whether people are true citizens under the law or whether they have come over as migrants later from @entity6			2
one of the very interesting and rather disturbing facts of this whole problem is that most people seem to think as that there was only one country involved in this border issue			2
but there are two countries			0
there 's @entity6 one side , there 's @entity294 on the other and the security and the security of the border is surely the responsibility of both countries			2
" but in the past she has referred to @entity21 with the pejorative term " bengalis " suggesting some should not be recognized as citizens in @entity5			1
the whole issue has tarnished the glow of fast - paced reform in @entity5			1
while the rest of the country is enjoying freedoms not experienced in 60 years of military dictatorship , in @entity313 the ethnic cleansing is continuing with impunity			0
it demands the attention of the international community , for the sake of children like @entity152 ... before it 's too late .			2

*rohingya* are a *stateless* @entity4 minority living in @entity5 's @entity241 state
thousands have been forced to flee the region amid persecution from @entity65 *majority*
they are driven to refugee camps where conditions are extremely poor
