a @entity1 man who lost $ 500,000 at blackjack and pai gow is suing a new @entity5 casino , alleging he was too drunk to be allowed to gamble over a 17 - hour period just before @entity6 weekend			1
@entity7 of @entity8 , @entity1 , is claiming he should n't have to pay the @entity11 @entity10 the $ 500,000 debt because employees served him so much alcohol that he suffered a blackout and was unable to remember the losses or even his gambling , the lawsuit alleges			1
in an interview thursday with @entity19 , @entity7 contended he was plied with liquor and victimized in an old - time hustle			1
" just picture a drunk walking the street and he 's drunk , and someone pickpockets and takes his money from him			0
that 's how i characterize it , " @entity7 said			1
" i feel like it 's the days of old vegas , the way they 've been extorting me with letters and attorneys			0
" the casino , which opened last november , declined to comment on the lawsuit , citing pending litigation , said spokeswoman @entity38			1
@entity7 said that he 's not being a bad loser			1
" i am not a sore loser			0
i 've lost half a million			0
i 've lost a lot of money			0
this has nothing to do with that , " the veteran gambler said			0
" obviously i can afford what i lost			0
" @entity7 , 52 , a former owner of a @entity49 car dealership , was standing beside his $ 250,000 @entity50 as he insisted his lawsuit was about a bigger issue			2
" this is about you almost killing me , " @entity7 said			1
" what if i had gone to bed that night , with all those drinks in me , and i threw up on myself and i choked and died ? " @entity7 acknowledged some responsibility for his drinking -- as many as 20 drinks while gambling over 17 hours on top of about 10 drinks before even stepping into the casino			1
" my responsibility is , look , i had some drinks at the airport , on the plane			0
at some point , that 's my responsibility , " @entity7 said			1
" the unfortunate part about it for them is , they have a bigger responsibility than i do			0
" @entity7 was referring to how the casino must follow @entity77 laws on how complimentary drinks are given to gamblers			1
in fact , the @entity82 is now investigating the @entity11 , formerly the @entity84 , on whether it violated gaming regulations , said @entity85 , chief of the board 's enforcement division			1
those regulations prohibit casinos from " permitting persons who are visibly intoxicated to participate in gaming activity " and from providing " complimentary service of intoxicating beverages in the casino area to persons who are visibly intoxicated			1
" " we are investigating this thoroughly , " @entity85 said			0
" we are aware of this matter			0
we 'll see if there are regulation violations			0
" the casino could face a license revocation or fines or both if the violations are substantiated , @entity85 said			0
@entity106 , the casino spokeswoman , also declined to comment about the state investigation			2
@entity7 , a frequent gambler in @entity5 , had always been a cash player at casinos and was never issued a line of credit more than $ 25,000			1
still , in the past 10 years , he had never drawn on any casino line of credit , the lawsuit said			0
he worked in real estate and car sales and was the owner of a @entity50 dealership in west @entity49			0
during @entity6 weekend , however , he and a female friend flew from the @entity120 , @entity1 , airport to @entity5 , and he had consumed several alcoholic drinks by the time the couple ate dinner at a restaurant run by the @entity125 , according to a sequence of events described in the lawsuit			1
at dinner , @entity7 was visibly drunk , which was also observed by an old friend , a law professor at the @entity131 at @entity5 who joined the pair for dinner			1
@entity7 was so inebriated that he had no recollection of leaving the restaurant on january 30 or the subsequent 44 hours , when he gambled in the casino and took out markers totaling $ 500,000			2
he lost all that money at the @entity141 domino game pai gow and at a private blackjack table during 17 hours of uninterrupted gambling and drinking , until the late afternoon of the following day			0
@entity7 takes prescribed medication that increases the intoxicating effects of alcohol , and a casino host who invited @entity7 to the @entity11 was aware of @entity7 's use of the medication , the suit alleged			1
" mr. @entity7 , an experienced gambler , was dropping chips on the floor , confusing chip colors , and slurring his speech badly , and he was unable to read his cards or set his hands properly , " the lawsuit said			2
" to her shock , after sleeping for seven to eight hours , ( @entity7 's female friend ) found mr. @entity7 still gambling at the blackjack table , and still heavily intoxicated , late in the afternoon of january 31 , 2014 , " the suit said			2
the suit recounts how @entity7 took out two lines of credit for $ 100,000 each in the span of 21 minutes after 2 a.m. on january 31			2
by 10:52 a.m. , @entity7 had taken out a third marker , for $ 50,000			2
almost two hours later , he signed another marker for $ 250,000 , the suit said			0
moreover , the casino allegedly reneged on providing @entity7 with a 20 % discount on repaying the $ 500,000 , which would have reduced the debt to $ 400,000 , the lawsuit claimed			2
the casino also allegedly demanded that @entity7 repay the $ 500,000 debt 46 days early , before a march 31 deadline , said the lawsuit , which was filed in february			2
in the days after losing the $ 500,000 , @entity7 went to the @entity179 , one of his preferred @entity5 gaming destinations , but a @entity11 representative called the @entity183 and told them of @entity7 's debt , cautioning them about doing business with @entity7 and " sullying mr. @entity7 's good name in the process , " the lawsuit said			1
the lawsuit seeks to nullify the gambling losses and seeks compensatory as well as punitive damages " in an amount sufficient to deter the @entity11 from similar conduct in the future , " the suit said .			0

@entity7 says he was victimized in old @entity5 hustle
" this is about you almost killing me , " he says of casino 's free drinks
