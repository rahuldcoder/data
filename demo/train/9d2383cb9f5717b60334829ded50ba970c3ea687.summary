some things you just know for a fact			2
first @entity4 president : @entity5			2
first human to walk on the moon : @entity8			0
first to achieve powered flight : @entity10			1
at least that 's what @entity11 says			1
state lawmakers passed a bill this week to honor @entity16 , who they claim beat the @entity17 by two years			1
according to a 1901 @entity11 newspaper account , @entity16 -- a @entity19 immigrant -- flew his aircraft 150 feet in the air for about a half mile over the city of @entity25			1
the claim has been backed up by a respected aviation reference guide			2
the debate has got the @entity30 's longtime aviation historian frustrated and worried			1
it also has triggered conspiratorial accusations about a " secret agreement " between the revered museum and the @entity10			1
let 's pause to remember that , hey , these guys are worldwide heroes			0
the image of their two - winged plane has appeared on @entity4 money			0
on postage stamps , too			0
@entity42 , @entity43 , where the @entity17 flew , stands as a popular national landmark			2
it generates untold tourism dollars for a state that has labeled its car license tags with the words , " @entity51			0
" these are more than just bragging rights			0
a lot is at stake			0
this is a big deal			0
" there is no legitimacy to the claim , " says @entity57 , the @entity30 's aviation historian			1
" justice is at risk			0
credit should go where credit is deserved			0
" not long after @entity16 's alleged flight , @entity57 says , experts tried to find witnesses quoted in the @entity11 newspaper 's account			1
only one of two named witnesses could be found , says @entity57 , and that witness said the flight never happened			1
if @entity16 really was first to fly , @entity57 asks , " why did n't he repeat it later ? did he forget the secret of flight ? then he started building machines based on other people 's designs			1
why would he do that if his own inventions were successful ? " ever since @entity16 's flight , @entity57 says " absolutely everyone has rejected those claims			1
" @entity88 , " a respected aviation reference guide , has endorsed the claim			2
also , @entity91 aviation historian @entity90 says he found key photographic evidence			1
last march , while rummaging through a museum attic in @entity19 , @entity90 says he found a lost photo that may depict the plane in flight			1
" it was quite an emotional moment for me			0
i just jumped up in the air screaming , " @entity90 says when experts confirmed that the photo was authentic			1
but does the photo show the plane in flight ? " it 's just a blotch , " says @entity57 , describing the blurry image			1
" it 's not an airplane			0
" @entity90 agrees that the blurry image fails to offer definitive proof			1
but rather than trying to prove what the photograph shows or does n't show , @entity90 has been focusing on establishing the credibility of journalists and witness reports from the 1901 flight			1
journalists in the 1930s and afterward interviewed 17 witnesses who said they saw @entity16 flying , @entity90 says			1
the stories by 14 of those witnesses were notarized			0
based on his research , @entity90 believes @entity16 did indeed fly before the @entity17			1
are you a window seater or aisle flier ? then there 's that so - called " secret agreement			0
" " in fact , " @entity57 says , " it was never secret			0
" " that 's not true , " @entity90 said later			2
" it was n't subject to the official secrets act , but it was kept from the public			2
" to hear @entity57 tell it , when the @entity134 family signed a contract to give the @entity30 the brothers ' plane , the museum promised never to declare another aircraft the first to achieve powered flight			1
@entity57 says the family " stuck one clause into that contract that said if the @entity30 ever says anybody flew before the @entity10 , we have the right to take the airplane back			1
that clause is in fact still in the contract , " @entity57 says			0
" as an honest historian , i never felt bound by that clause			2
if i found evidence that i think indicated somebody else had flown before the @entity17 , i would say so			2
" " what else would you say in his shoes ? " asks @entity90			2
" and if that 's the case , why does n't he examine the @entity16 claim ? " @entity90 says he recently worked with the @entity30 on a project for the @entity156			1
aviation geeks take on @entity159 spotter destinations offer aviation thrills for @entity11 state rep. @entity162 , one of the sponsors of the bill , acknowledging @entity16 's flight means money and prestige for his hometown			1
" it will put @entity25 on the map			0
" @entity162 says , " it will become synonymous with being first in flight , which would enable us to have a museum			2
with that , we would generate some tourist attractions			0
" with the economy being what it is these days , @entity162 says the tourism dollars would be important to the region			0
@entity162 mentions that @entity25 is already known as the home of another flying object -- the @entity182			0
but that claim also has been the subject of some debate			0
does @entity162 actually believe @entity16 was first ? " yeah , " he says confidently			2
he thinks history books should be re-written to say @entity16 beat the @entity17			1
no matter , says @entity57			0
the truth will win out			0
" you ca n't legislate history , " he says			1
@entity90 says , " it 's the @entity30 that tried to negotiate history with this contract with the @entity17			1
" it 's back , but will @entity194 live up to its name ? meanwhile , the move puts @entity11 at odds with @entity43 and @entity198 -- who 've been fighting amongst themselves for decades for a share of the @entity10 ' tourism dollars			1
most everybody knows about the brothers ' aviation experiments on the @entity43 dunes			2
but @entity198 reminds the world that the @entity208 lived in @entity209			0
there , in their bicycle shop , they invented and developed much of their aviation machinery			2
there 's a reason why the @entity218 's teams are called the @entity219			0
but what about @entity221 's ? their reference guide endorsement has to mean something , right ? as respected as @entity221 's is , says @entity57 , " it 's not a historical publication			0
it 's a reference book			0
it 's damaging and that 's why it kind of worries me			0
" the @entity16 story , which pops up in the media every few decades , is dangerous , @entity57 says , because it plants the seeds of doubt in a story which should be seen as indisputable			2
however , this is n't the only dispute against the @entity10 ' legacy			1
@entity57 says millions of @entity240 believe their pioneer aviator @entity241 actually invented the airplane			0
" @entity240 claims @entity241 was first because his aircraft had wheels , and the @entity134 's launched on rails , " @entity57 says			0
whatever the case , @entity11 has started a brawl that could end up rewriting world history			1
or it could all fade away in a blur of unproven claims			0
what do you think ? are @entity11 lawmakers acting prematurely by officially declaring @entity16 as the first to achieve powered flight ? let us know what you think in the comments section below .			1
