-- while @entity2 wallows in the doldrums of economic despondency and political turmoil , with youth unemployment at eye - watering levels and @entity9 separatists threatening to tear away at the country 's seams , there is one place where its stock has never been higher			0
on the motorcycling track , 2013 's calendar is a parade of @entity18 supremacy , with @entity2 dominating every race class to the almost complete exclusion of other nations			1
at the forefront of this is @entity25 's newly - crowned champion : a 20 - year - old whose debut season in the elite division has delighted even the most jaded observers of this most daring of motorsports			1
@entity30 has exploded onto the scene like a grinning @entity32 , redefining the expectations of rookie riders and cocking a gleeful snook at the establishment , leaving dazed rivals scratching their heads in disbelief			1
after a bizarre disqualification at the @entity41 @entity25 threatened his commanding lead in the championship , @entity30 kept his head with two remarkably mature displays of disciplined riding -- first in @entity47 and then during a frenzied final race at @entity2 's @entity50 circuit , to take a richly deserved title			1
as the youngest champion in the history of top - level motorcycling , known by his @entity9 fans as " the @entity57 from @entity58 , " he has a vividly bright future			1
someone who knows all about the challenges of being a @entity25 rookie is @entity63 , who spent two tough seasons riding for the satellite @entity65 after making the step up from @entity68 , where he was a double world champion			1
now touring with his rock band and preparing for an attempt at the world two - wheeled land speed record , @entity63 is a big admirer of @entity30 and believes his youth is actually an advantage			2
" it just happens as a 20 - year - old , " said @entity63 , who returned to @entity68 before a wrist injury ended his racing career in 2011			0
" all you 're seeing is a young kid ; he does n't understand the mechanics of the bike so well yet , or the people he 's racing against -- all he 's doing is putting his helmet on , putting his leathers on , cocking his leg over that bike and absolutely wringing its neck , with the confidence of what he 's achieved previously in @entity93 and the old 125 cc class			0
" ' nobody can do something like that ' @entity98 , principal of the @entity100 team and leader of the @entity103 group that represents @entity25 's teams , told @entity0 that @entity30 served early notice of his special talent			1
" i remember one of his last races in the old 125 class , in @entity110 , " he said			0
" the race was shortened to something like five or seven laps			0
he crashed on the warmup and he had to start from the pit lane because he pitted to have his bike fixed , so he started dead last , and quite a lot after the last row , but he won that race			0
" he won the championship that year , and from that moment we thought , ' nobody can do something like that			0
' " @entity124 , ceo of @entity125 -- the organization that runs @entity25 -- was struck by the way @entity30 immediately looked at home in the top class			1
" his personality is really important , " @entity124 told @entity0			0
" he 's somebody who arrived to the championship as a hero , kind of saying , ' i 'm here , i want to be here			0
' " immediately when he arrived in the top class he started coming to the @entity25 executive commission with the other riders , and immediately he wanted to hear and give his opinions ; he 's a great talent but also a great personality			1
" fresh attitude this vibrant personality is one of the key reasons many see @entity30 as the natural successor to @entity146 's charismatic seven - time world champion @entity145			1
the @entity149 's smiling demeanor has not only won him fans off the track , it also appears to have helped guide him through the stresses of the @entity25 season			1
" he brings so much energy , such a fresh way of behaving , a fresh mind , enthusiasm , " @entity98 told @entity0			1
" in @entity41 ( after @entity30 was controversially disqualified ) @entity158 , @entity159 or @entity145 would have left the track and been very long faced			1
@entity30 was on a crate , while everyone was packing , eating some crisps , and laughing with his crew			2
" he 's always in the paddock			0
although the other guys are walking to and from their motorhome and the box , in between the two they have their sunglasses and their headphones on and are not talking to anybody			0
@entity30 is always there , anything that is happening in the paddock he 's there			1
" the attitude of this guy is a big bonus for our championship and it 's so good to see a top guy who is still going out and playing with the @entity184 guys , and being available for anyone			2
" the almost universal affection for @entity30 has also given last season 's champion @entity158 -- who missed out by four points this time despite winning sunday 's final race -- pause for thought			1
" mother nature did n't gift @entity158 the way she gifted @entity30 , " @entity98 said			2
" on the riding he can compete with @entity197 and he 's showing that every weekend , but @entity30 is so much more appreciated by everyone because of his nature , and @entity30 instantly makes you feel at home with him ; he inspires sympathy , and not everybody has got that			1
" and i think @entity158 is trying very hard to change his image , which is not as likeable as @entity30 's , but this is something that is not easy to change			2
" personality with great talent @entity210 recognizes the importance of @entity30 's personality , but says it is important not to overlook his talent			1
" the most important thing is to be a very good rider , " he said			0
" @entity145 , ( @entity218 ) @entity217 , @entity158 , @entity159 and other riders have put the championship at an incredible level , and i think one of the assets of @entity30 is that he has been beating people like @entity158 and @entity159 , who are really great , great riders			1
" of course the personality is important , but just the personality is not enough -- it needs to be the personality together with a great , great rider			2
" @entity63 believes the crew in @entity30 's @entity231 garage deserve credit for their approach to blooding the young star			2
" they 've employed a young kid and nurtured him , " he said			0
" they will have put the settings on the bike to where they will see the data and the electronics -- on how he 's opening the throttle up and how he 's riding -- and they will have given him a bit of a safety net at first , because there 's a massive power difference between @entity249 and @entity25			2
" then they would have gradually opened up the power , decreased the traction control , the anti-wheelie control , all the settings you can change on a bike , to build his confidence			0
" @entity30 was allowed to go straight into a factory motogp team -- @entity231 -- at an age that was previously prohibited by the sport 's so - called " rookie rule			1
" it was scrapped last year , having been introduced in 2010 to spread riding talent around the satellite teams			0
@entity63 believes this has been significant , and that other stars have also helpfully aligned to smooth @entity30 's path to success			1
" to join one of the best teams , with what looks like the best bike this year -- and with @entity158 and @entity159 both injuring themselves and missing a race early in the year -- for him to then get the confidence of actually learning how to win , and getting a couple of wins under his belt , all those factors put into the pot have just made him so confident in what he 's doing , " he said			2
" you can see when he 's on track that he 's not fazed by anything or anyone , from the confidence he 's got from having that little bit of breathing space earlier in the year			0
" the next big chapter ? @entity98 believes that @entity30 would have achieved success even without a factory bike			2
" at the moment he has the lot , he 's on what feels like the best bike , which is for sure a bonus , although @entity158 is showing us that the @entity65 is not so bad , " he said			0
" but , and this is just my opinion , i 'm not so sure that ( on a satellite @entity231 ) he would have done a lot less			0
" as well as winning friends with his smiling demeanor and openness off the track , @entity30 has also caught the eye with his audacious riding style , which sees his elbow as well as his knee pressing down on the track through corners			1
this enables him to better gauge what both the front and the rear of the bike are doing , providing a " fourth wheel " to help him get around faster			0
other riders have begun to mimic this spectacular and effective technique			0
@entity63 is among many startled by this evolution , and puts it partly down to advances in racing tires			0
" i used to get my elbow down with qualifying tires , and that 's what it 's all about really -- it 's the tire technology , @entity330 have obviously developed a tire with the edge grip now that enables the bike to lean over that far , and also enable you to lean off the bike that much with the confidence that the grip is there , " he said			0
" it 's not just @entity30 now , you see others like @entity342 and @entity158 with their elbows down			2
it 's not so much that they 've changed their style , it 's the tire is allowing the bike to lean over that far			0
" they might be able to follow him , but can anyone can catch @entity30 next year ? " it 's always difficult to say , ' he 's going to be the greatest of all time , ' " @entity98 said			2
" but clearly if you remember the last 40 years you have @entity354 , then you have the @entity356 era , you have the @entity145 era , and i think @entity30 is ready , if nothing bad happens to him , to write another big chapter of @entity25 history			1

@entity30 has impressed with his demeanor as well as his success on the track
