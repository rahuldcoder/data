-- my neighbor recently discovered a four - digit passcode that unlocks the front doors to our apartment building			2
he shared the code with me , as well as with his girlfriend , buddies and a few other neighbors			0
i shared it with some people , and so did others			2
within a few weeks , the building 's security system was buzzing constantly for people who did n't actually have one of the dozen or so physical keys given to tenants			1
my apartment building 's security is not all that different from the password - protected login system that forms a chain - link fence around @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 or any other internet service			1
passwords are often shared among family , friends and spouses , and people typically use the same passwords for everything			2
many experts say passwords are cybersecurity 's weak link			0
to minimize identity theft , the @entity40 administration is urging @entity43 companies to agree upon and adopt a standard , reliable identity - verification system that people can use for any website			1
each person would choose one company , perhaps their e-mail service provider , to handle credentials for sensitive personal or financial information on other sites			1
in this hypothetical digital world , someone could buy books on @entity56 using a @entity25 account , while another person could sign up for a social network using a @entity61 account			1
because the @entity62 government is involved , @entity62 might be able to download their tax forms by signing into , say , their @entity66 accounts			2
president @entity40 introduced the initiative in spring 2011 , and development of the technology seems to be moving at the speed of @entity71 , not @entity72			1
almost a year later , there 's no consensus among web companies and government about what exactly this should look like and when we should expect to see it			1
some websites have already embraced an idea similar to what is being proposed , without the government giving them a push			2
for example , users of @entity87 , a travel organizer from @entity89 , can log in using their @entity24 , @entity25 or @entity92 accounts			1
but this typically involves small utilities piggybacking on the networks of larger companies			0
the biggest @entity43 players , such as @entity56 , @entity98 , @entity24 and @entity25 , do not play well with each other			1
instead , @entity24 and @entity25 boast about how quickly they are convincing users to volunteer their personal information in setting up profiles			1
@entity98 regularly mentions how many credit cards its @entity26 service has on file -- at last count , more than 225 million			0
people involved in the government initiative said the major players have informally expressed interest			1
but a @entity25 spokesman declined to make executives available for comment for this story			1
a @entity24 spokesman declined to comment and a @entity61 spokeswoman did n't respond to a request for comment			1
these companies may view their respective platforms as a competitive advantage , said @entity121 , the executive chairman for the @entity122			0
his organization has been trying to provide a sort of universal login system that includes @entity25 and @entity92 , but some users find the system 's row of tiny buttons confusing			1
@entity130 will launch a simplified , single - button alternative called @entity132 in the next few months , @entity121 said			2
@entity121 said he believes technology companies may eventually realize the limits of their identity silos			2
similar to how people can now send text messages to friends on different cellular networks , or how a @entity141 user can open a @entity143 file , internet login systems should one day standardize , he said			1
" this notion of standards , as boring as it is , is really the plumbing of the internet economy , " @entity121 said			0
" it turns out that you can only go so far with business and internet services until you come up with standards			0
standards help the pie grow bigger			0
" internet giants have not been eager to unite on their own			0
for various reasons , having the government involved either provides the best possibility for bringing rivals together or will poison the well , according to people involved			1
companies and citizens alike can sometimes have an allergic reaction to government intervention , especially when privacy is involved			2
when president @entity40 announced last year that he was handing over the keys for an online identity initiative to the @entity173 , talk of an " online driver 's license " ensued			1
observers say that 's not an apt analogy because the identity system , as proposed , would n't be required for using the @entity180 , nor would it be issued by the government			1
but the idea of a government - controlled database spooked many people			1
what @entity40 's proposal describes is a series of security problems on the @entity43 , such as insecure passwords and people handing over sensitive data to dozens of companies , as well as some vague suggestions for how to solve them			1
" it 's not a piece of legislation , " said @entity196 , a fellow at the @entity197 , an internet privacy group in @entity71			0
" instead , it 's the federal government saying here is our vision of how to improve identity on the @entity43			1
" a year ago , @entity208 inherited the project			0
he is a senior executive for the @entity173 's @entity210 , and he is playing government liaison to tech companies and privacy advocates as part of the @entity215 , or @entity215			2
the government 's prospective standard for online identity is not expected to result in a law , as long as companies can come to an agreement among themselves			1
the system could be regulated by the @entity224 , said people involved in the planning			1
" the way that @entity71 tends to affect change is to either pass a law or to pass a regulation to make something happen , " @entity208 said			2
" @entity215 is a bit of a policy experiment			1
" after failed government experiments , the @entity62 has observed that an online id has to be driven by companies , not countries , and has to keep internet anonymity intact , @entity208 said			0
" we could , on paper , come up with what would be the perfect mousetrap , and no one would want to buy it , " @entity208 said			0
" the federal government does n't care if you 're a dog [ online ] or not			2
anonymity and pseudonymity have always been hallmarks of the @entity43			0
" bidding will begin this month on @entity215 pilot programs that should launch in the summer to demonstrate what an online identity framework could look like , @entity208 said			0
the government will carefully determine what safeguards will be implemented in the identification process and the punishments for violators , he said			0
some sites could begin launching @entity215 login options in about two years , he said			0
others were not so optimistic			0
persuading every major internet company and then every web user to sign up will be a massive undertaking , said @entity196 , from the @entity197			0
" the work of herding cats is just beginning , " he said			0
because this is such an unusual policy experiment , the government can not point to a similar program in the past that has been successful , said @entity121 , who is also the chairman of the @entity272 , which counts @entity273 , @entity25 , @entity61 and @entity274 among its members			1
also , other countries may object to an initiative led by the @entity62 , he said			0
what this system will look like remains undefined			0
people may have to type in a temporary password received via text message , answer quiz questions or identify friends in photographs , according to people involved in the initiative			0
@entity215 could even require a hardware dongle that users plug into their computers , though that 's unlikely as people increasingly move to mobile devices that do n't have standard inputs , they said			2
just about everyone involved is in agreement that today 's model of people picking their own passwords will not survive much longer			0
" the greatest threat to security and the greatest threat to privacy are passwords , " @entity121 said			0
" passwords are really yesterday 's news			0

@entity40 administration is proposing a standardized login system for the web
people would choose @entity24 , @entity25 or another site as their provider
the identity - verification system would then work on any website
because the government does n't plan to write a law , this is a policy experiment
