-- president @entity1 reframed @entity3 foreign policy priorities on tuesday by focusing his administration 's immediate attention on @entity7 's pursuit of nuclear weapons and the @entity10 conflict between @entity11 and the @entity12			1
" while these issues are not the cause of all the region 's problems , they have been a major source of instability for far too long , and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace , " he said in a 50 - minute speech on the opening day of the @entity15 in @entity16			0
at the same time , @entity1 challenged the world body to enforce its ban on chemical weapons by agreeing to crack down on @entity30 -- even militarily -- if the regime of president @entity32 fails to turn over control of its stockpiles			1
" there must be a strong @entity37 resolution to verify that the @entity32 regime is keeping its commitments , and there must be consequences if they fail to do so , " he said			1
" if we can not agree even on this , then it will show that the @entity15 is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws			0
" his speech , which received little reaction from the gathered world leaders , sought to project a robust commitment to defending @entity3 interests abroad while declaring receptiveness to potential diplomatic openings that have emerged			2
it 's not about regime change or asserting @entity3 dominance , he insisted in calling for more unified international action in the world 's most persistent and contentious trouble spots			2
noting that new @entity7 president @entity61 and @entity63 ayatollah @entity62 have stated their nation only seeks the peaceful use of nuclear power , rather than nuclear weapons , @entity1 said the issue comes down to @entity7 demonstrating its sincerity			1
" to succeed , conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable , " he said , noting that " this is n't simply an issue between @entity3 and @entity7 -- the world has seen @entity7 evade its responsibilities in the past , and has an abiding interest in making sure that @entity7 meets its obligations in the future			1
" secretary of state @entity81 and his @entity7 counterpart , foreign minister @entity82 , both will attend a thursday meeting of the five permanent members of the @entity37 , plus @entity85			1
discussions will surround restarting talks on @entity7 's nuclear program			2
@entity1 sounded cautious about any possible breakthrough , saying " the roadblocks may prove to be too great , but i firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested			2
" later tuesday , @entity61 said in his @entity15 speech that @entity7 was prepared for immediate nuclear talks that are " time - bound and result - oriented ... to build mutual confidence and removal of mutual uncertainties			1
" the @entity7 leader also said he iistened carefully to @entity1 's speech and hoped that the @entity3 " will refrain from following the short - sighted interests of warmongering pressure groups " so that the two nations " can arrive at a framework to manage our differences			1
" @entity61 touched on one of those differences , criticizing what he described as " structural violence " against @entity12			0
while he never mentioned @entity3 ally @entity11 by name , the intention of his comments was clear			0
" @entity113 is under occupation ; the basic rights of the @entity12 are tragically violated , and they are deprived of the right of return and access to their homes , birthplace and homeland , " he said			0
" apartheid as a concept can hardly describe the crimes and the institutionalized aggression against the innocent @entity12 people			0
" @entity1 earlier called for " the entire international community " to support renewal of the @entity10 peace process , noting that @entity11 and @entity12 leaders " have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks			0
" " now the rest of us must also be willing to take risks , " @entity1 said			0
" @entity137 , including the @entity3 , must recognize that @entity11 's security as a @entity140 and democratic state depends upon the realization of a @entity12 state			0
arab states -- and those who have supported the @entity12 -- must recognize that stability will only be served through a two - state solution with a secure @entity11			0
" on @entity30 , @entity1 addressed both the august 21 sarin gas attack on suburban @entity148 that he blamed on @entity32 's regime and the civil war that has raged for more than two years and killed over 100,000 people , according to @entity15 figures			1
critics at home and abroad contend the @entity3 was too slow in backing rebels fighting the @entity30 regime , which allowed @entity32 's forces to gain the advantage with help from @entity160 , @entity7 and @entity162 fighters from @entity163			1
at the same time , @entity1 's threats of a @entity3 military attack on @entity32 's forces to try to prevent any further chemical weapons attacks failed to generate support from the @entity168 , due to @entity160 's opposition , as well as normally reliable @entity171 ally @entity170 and @entity172			1
some @entity1 opponents argued he showed weakness by not attacking @entity30 anyway , despite the lack of international support			1
@entity1 said such criticism " mirrors a contradiction that has persisted in the region for decades			0
" " the @entity3 is chastised for meddling in the region , and accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracy , " he said			0
" at the same time , the @entity3 is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the region 's problems , and for showing indifference toward suffering @entity188 populations			2
" he outlined @entity3 foreign policy for the remainder of his presidency , declaring a willingness " to use all elements of our power , including military force " to secure core interests in the @entity10 and @entity198			1
@entity1 specified that the @entity3 would confront aggression against allies and partners and ensure the free flow of @entity10 oil to the world , adding that " although @entity3 is steadily reducing our own dependence on imported oil , the world still depends upon the region 's energy supply , and a severe disruption could destabilize the entire global economy			1
" he also pledged to continue the fight against terrorist networks by working with other nations and taking " direct action " when necessary			0
in words clearly directed at @entity7 , @entity1 specified that " we will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction			1
" " just as we consider the use of chemical weapons in @entity30 to be a threat to our own national security , we reject the development of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region , and undermine the global non-proliferation regime , " he said			2
noting that the @entity3 was emerging from a " perpetual war footing " after more than a decade of conflict in @entity234 and @entity235 , @entity1 acknowledged that unilateral @entity3 action -- particularly military action -- was unable to achieve the desired development of democratic systems , open markets and respect for human rights around the world			2
" @entity234 shows us that democracy can not be imposed by force , " he said			0
@entity1 also directed a challenge to his fellow world leaders , noting that the @entity168 was created in ashes of @entity249 so that nations could work together to confront global challenges and conflict			1
" the question is whether we possess the wisdom and the courage as nation states and members of the international community to squarely meet those challenges ; for the @entity168 to meet the challenges of our time , " he said			2
that means answering the inevitable call for action , @entity1 said			0
" while the @entity15 was designed to prevent wars between states , increasingly we face the challenge of preventing slaughter within states , " he said , adding that " in such moments , the international community will need to acknowledge that the multilateral use of military force may be required to prevent the very worst from occurring			0
