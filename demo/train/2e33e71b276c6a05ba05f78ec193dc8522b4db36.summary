as pro bono lawyers for @entity2 for 12 years , we continue to be amazed at how people opposed to executive clemency for our client invariably withhold , distort , and even fabricate facts to justify their position			1
the most recent manifestation of this phenomenon is the june 16 opinion piece by @entity11 , " @entity12 wrong to demand release of @entity15 traitor			0
" mr. @entity2 is serving his 27th year of an unprecedented sentence of life in prison for delivering classified information to the state of @entity12 , a close ally of the @entity15			1
@entity11 does a disservice to his readers by fabricating facts			0
for example , @entity11 refers confidently to @entity2 's " trial , " and says that during his " trial , " @entity2 was accused of attempting to pass classified information to @entity28 and other countries			1
perhaps @entity11 does n't know that @entity2 never had a trial			1
this fact could have easily been found through a @entity33 search			0
and @entity2 was never charged by the @entity15 with passing ( or attempting to pass ) classified information to any country other than @entity12 , for the very simple reason that he never attempted to do so			2
@entity11 invents putative facts to support his opinion			0
likewise , @entity11 writes of @entity2 's purported " treason			1
" but he was never charged with ( much less convicted of ) treason			2
nor could he have been , as treason requires aid to an enemy of the @entity15			2
@entity11 notes gravely that " treason " is addressed in the @entity44			2
if @entity11 had bothered to read that document , he would have seen that the @entity44 says that " treason against the @entity15 , shall consist only in levying @entity48 against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and @entity54			0
" @entity12 is not an enemy of the @entity15			0
once again , a basic check of the facts would have revealed that @entity2 did not commit treason			1
what should be equally disturbing to @entity11 's readers are the critical facts he withholds			0
@entity11 makes it seem as if it is mostly the people and leaders of @entity12 who want @entity2 to receive clemency			1
@entity11 fails to mention that @entity67 , the @entity15 secretary of state at the time of @entity2 's activities , has come out publicly in favor of clemency			1
similarly , @entity72 , who was @entity15 national security adviser at that time , has also come out publicly in favor of clemency			0
it is safe to say that these gentlemen know more than anyone about @entity2 's conduct			1
the fact that they have come out in favor of clemency speaks volumes			0
but @entity11 chooses not to mention this			0
nor does he mention that numerous distinguished @entity15 have come out publicly in favor of clemency , including former secretary of state @entity84 , former attorney general @entity86 , former vice president @entity87 , former cia director @entity88 , former @entity90 chairman @entity89 , dozens of members of @entity92 and many others			1
perhaps @entity11 claims to know more than they do about the @entity2 case			2
then again , @entity11 claims mr. @entity2 had a trial and committed treason			1
@entity11 is entitled to hold any opinion he wishes			0
but his readers are entitled to an honest presentation of the facts , not a series of falsehoods buttressed by material omissions .			0

@entity2 is serving his 27th year of *imprisonment* for *conspiracy* to commit *espionage*
@entity2 's attorneys say his sentence is unduly harsh , that he 's been victim of distortions
lawyers : @entity2 's crime did not amount to treason
@entity84 , @entity67 , @entity87 are among those supporting clemency , they say
