@entity0 -- the @entity2 has rejected congressional calls for the justices to adhere officially to the same ethics rules binding on other federal judges , including when to recuse in cases involving possible conflicts of interest			1
" @entity15 does not plan to adopt the @entity16 for @entity18 judges through a formal resolution , " chief justice @entity10 wrote in a letter released tuesday to @entity13 chairman @entity12 , @entity14			1
but @entity10 said he and his eight colleagues would -- on their own initiative -- continue to follow the same rules as other judges when it comes to accepting and reporting on outside income , honoraria , and gifts			1
unlike other members of the federal judiciary , @entity2 justices decide for themselves whether a conflict of interest exists , requiring disqualification			1
like other judges , they file yearly disclosure reports on their financial investments , travels , and any money earned from such things as writing books , giving speeches or teaching			0
the binding @entity16 of @entity18 judges requires recusal when " impartiality might reasonably be questioned , " including having a family member directly involved in the case or if there is a financial interest , such as a justice owning stock in a company being sued			2
@entity12 had asked the nation 's highest court to release an internal , informal 1991 resolution clarifying the justices ' unofficial intention to follow the code			1
" we will make the 1991 resolution adopting the @entity63 regulations on gifts and on outside earned income available to the public , " wrote @entity10			1
@entity12 had no immediate response to the court 's decision , but groups supporting greater disclosure said they were disappointed			2
" the @entity2 is the highest court in our land and should be held to the highest ethics standards , not the lowest , " said @entity74 president @entity73			2
" this is yet another disappointing sign from the @entity78 that it considers itself above the laws and rules the rest of us must abide by			0
" the judicial code of conduct has recently become a divisive political issue as the justices prepare to hear arguments next month in the high - stakes appeal over the health care reform law championed by president @entity89			1
political advocacy groups on both sides -- including members of @entity93 -- have separately called on justices @entity94 and @entity96 to recuse themselves from hearing and deciding the case			1
@entity94 , 51 , was the administration 's top government lawyer handling appeals to the @entity2			2
her nomination by @entity89 in may 2010 , and the weeks leading up to it , came at a time when @entity93 had passed -- and the president signed -- the @entity105			0
the health care reform law would significantly change how @entity18 receive medical services and has been the subject of six current appeals pending at the high court			1
twenty - eight states and dozens of individual plaintiffs have opposed the law			0
critics say she was directly involved in the administration 's initial legal strategy of the health care law			1
congressional democrats have been among those separately calling on @entity96 to pull out , citing his recent lapse in reporting the income of his wife for 13 straight years , as required by federal disclosure laws			0
@entity125 had worked for , and later founded , her own advocacy group , @entity126			0
since she has openly opposed the health care bill , many liberals have said her political activities raise questions about justice @entity96 ' own judicial independence and impartiality			2
the court by tradition will not openly discuss when to step aside in a pending case , and that is true with @entity96 and @entity94			0
@entity10 in his year - end report in december said he had " complete confidence " in his @entity2 colleagues to fairly decide whether to remove themselves from hot - button cases such as health care reform " the @entity2 does not sit in judgment of one its own members ' decision whether to recuse in the course of deciding a case , " he said of his bench mates , while not directly addressing the @entity94 and @entity96 recusal demands			1
" they are jurists of exceptional integrity and experience whose character and fitness have been examined through a vigorous appointment and confirmation process			0
i know that they each give careful consideration to any recusal questions that arise			0
" that letter prompted @entity12 and four fellow democrats on the @entity162 this month to seek more information from the high court on the ethics issue			0
@entity12 and other lawmakers are also pushing legislation mandating the @entity2 open its public sessions to cameras			0
again , the ultimate unilateral decision on that would be left with justices , a majority of whom have expressed severe reservations about the proposal .			0

@entity2 justices will continue to follow same rules as other judges , says @entity10
he says the court will release an internal , informal 1991 resolution
it 's *strictly* up to justices to decide whether they should recuse themselves
various groups want two justices to recuse themselves from the health care reform case
