-- @entity1 has had plenty to say about the blue clay at the @entity4 and he was in no mood to change his mind after a minor scare on his first competitive outing on the new surface			1
the world @entity10 thought the players should have been consulted on @entity4 's decision to depart from the traditional red clay and the @entity16 cut a frustrated figure as he beat @entity19 qualifier @entity20 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 2			1
" it 's impossible to move , " he was quoted as telling reporters by @entity22			2
" i hit maybe five balls , the rest went just trying to put the ball into the court			0
" i was relying on serve and getting free points from his unforced errors			0
that was not tennis , either i need football shoes or some advice on how to play on this court			0
" i can not find the words to describe this court			0
it 's really tough to play like this on a center court			2
we need serious discussion about the future of this blue clay			1
" we can not change anything this year , but my first impressions are not good			0
i do n't want to be the one complaining , but i say honestly what i feel			0
" @entity1 's victory was his first outing since he lost to @entity50 in the @entity51 and his win set up a third round clash with either @entity54 or @entity55			1
no. 6 seed @entity57 , from the @entity56 , defeated @entity60 's @entity59 6 - 4 6 - 3 while @entity62 's @entity61 , who won the @entity63 last week , toppled @entity64 6 - 4 6 - 2			1
there were also victories for @entity68 trio @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
in the women 's draw the top two seeds , @entity73 and @entity74 , both made it safely into round three			1
@entity73 , the world no. 1 , beat the @entity56 's @entity79 6 - 3 7 - 6 before having her say on the blue clay surface			1
" the surface is a bit slippery , but it 's the same for all of us , " the @entity81 told reporters			1
" i do n't like to complain -- it is what it is and it wo n't change now			0
" @entity74 , striving to complete a major slam with victory at the @entity92 later this month , also toppled a @entity56 opponent , @entity93 6 - 4 6 - 3			1
" it 's not so much about the color , " she told a press conference			2
" it does look good on television			0
but it plays a bit different			0
" it 's about the amount of clay on the court and the way it bounces			2
i got settled in so it 's just a matter of adjusting			0
it 's also the same for everyone			0
" @entity16 @entity110 , the no. 13 seed , also made it into round three after beating @entity114 , from @entity115 , 7 - 5 6 - 1 .			1

@entity1 *unhappy* with @entity4 's blue clay surface after second - round win
@entity120 beats @entity20 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 2 but *criticizes* surface
@entity57 and @entity61 also enjoy victories in @entity19 *capital*
top two seeds @entity73 and @entity74 victorious in women 's draw
