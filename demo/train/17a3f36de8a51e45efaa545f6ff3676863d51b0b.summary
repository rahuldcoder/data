-- as @entity2 presidential candidates move closer to the key tests for their party 's nomination , the highly charged topic of @entity7 and its conflict with @entity9 has come up with increasing frequency in speeches and debates			1
most recently , @entity13 sent a jolt through the discussion with his description of @entity9 as " an invented " people			0
his rivals , without disagreeing , accused @entity20 of speaking irresponsibly and potentially hurting @entity7			2
most people in the @entity22 and around the world interpret the campaign pledges of love and support for @entity7 as an effort to win the @entity29 vote			1
but the @entity29 vote has little to do with it			1
the @entity2 candidates ' passionate vows to support @entity7 have two objectives			1
first , they aim to capture the @entity35 vote in a country where the vast majority of people side strongly with @entity7 and in a party where the most reliable primary voters , conservative @entity2 and evangelical @entity40 , express intense feelings on the subject			1
second , they seek to make president @entity44 look weak on foreign policy with an issue people care about and where the @entity2 thinks it might score some points			0
there are many things you can say about how @entity44 handled the @entity7 - @entity9 conflict			1
the one thing you can not say is that it succeeded			0
his early missteps managed to make @entity7 and @entity9 feel betrayed by @entity57			2
the very public pressure @entity44 exerted on @entity7 , has , according to some polls hurt his standing among @entity29 and among @entity7			2
but the president 's change in tone later helped him with both groups			0
most @entity7 now say they view him favorably			0
among @entity66 , @entity44 's approval may have sunk significantly to the low 50s , but that is still considerably higher than the approval he enjoys nationwide			0
despite the views of serious analysts and the calculations of conspiracy theorists , @entity29 voters are hardly the point			0
the numbers confirm that a @entity2 fight for the @entity29 vote would mostly amount to wasted energy			1
the number of @entity29 - @entity22 voters barely registers when compared with the size of the @entity35 vote			1
barely 2 % of @entity22 voters are @entity29 compared with more than 60 % who consider themselves @entity35			2
worse for @entity2 , a large and consistent majority of @entity29 vote @entity88			1
@entity44 won the @entity29 vote by an incredible 78 % in the last election			1
most @entity22 @entity29 have voted for @entity88 presidents for decades			0
even if half of them voted for a @entity2 this year , the prize during the primary is hardly worth the effort			0
the @entity35 vote is another matter			1
@entity22 support @entity7 so strongly that for every @entity29 in the @entity22 , there are at least 30 non-jews who say they side with the jewish state			1
support for @entity7 is at near - record highs , making a @entity35 position a winning formula for @entity2 and @entity88			1
it 's not just @entity2 candidates who proclaim their commitment to @entity7			1
despite his strained relationship with @entity7 prime minister @entity109 , @entity44 frequently asserts support			2
he expressed that sentiment in june at a @entity113 event , saying that " @entity7 's security will always be at the top tier of considerations ... because it 's the right thing to do , because @entity7 is our closest ally and friend ... it shares our values and it shares our principles			0
" those are words @entity35 voters , @entity29 or not , want to hear			2
if @entity2 candidates were trying to help @entity7 rather than chasing votes , they might stop using it as a political issue			1
the most damaging change they can bring to the jewish state 's security is to turn support for @entity7 into a partisan matter			2
until now , it is one of the few issues on which bitterly divided @entity2 and @entity88 usually agree			0
in fact , @entity20 's recent comments about @entity9 would not make him a lot of friends among @entity7			1
his incendiary remark -- that @entity142 was never a state and @entity9 identified themselves as @entity143 until recently -- does nothing to advance the cause of peace			0
however long @entity9 have seen themselves as a " people , " they now share a common history and view themselves as one			0
the obvious response to @entity20 's rhetorical @entity152 cocktail is , so what ? @entity20 seemed to imply @entity9 do not deserve a state			1
but the best conceivable way to end the @entity7 - @entity9 conflict is creating two states			2
that 's why a majority of @entity7 support the two - state solution			1
but for now , @entity2 candidates are worried about rounding up primary votes			2
one way to do that is by appealing to those with the most intense feelings and the greatest anxiety about @entity7 's security			0
more than 60 % of conservative @entity2 and evangelical @entity40 , according to a recent poll by the @entity169 , consider it " a very important goal " to protect @entity7			0
for evangelicals , in particular , the issue could decide their voting choice			0
that 's why @entity177 , for example , has spoken in almost mystical terms , saying " as a nation we have been blessed because of our relationship with @entity7			0
" @entity182 says his first trip as president will be to @entity7			0
all candidates -- except @entity186 , who wants to cut all foreign aid -- make support for @entity7 a cornerstone of their foreign policy			0
once the @entity2 choose their candidate and the race becomes a two - person contest , both sides will try to show they are the most committed to maintaining the strongest of ties and the greatest commitment to @entity7 's security			1
it will be a quest for the backing of @entity29 voters , but more importantly , an effort to entice the much larger pool of @entity22 who consider themselves supporters of @entity7 .			0

@entity206 says @entity2 candidates avow support for @entity7 more and more frequently
she says they are not *courting* small @entity29 vote as much as large @entity35 vote
she says if candidates really want to help @entity7 , they should back off inflammatory remarks
@entity206 : most @entity7 back two - state solution ; @entity20 's @entity9 comment hurts
