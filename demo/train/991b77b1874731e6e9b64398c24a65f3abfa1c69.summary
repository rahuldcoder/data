-- some thought it was a bomb			2
others thought it was the commuter train that runs behind their buildings jumping the tracks			2
it shook upper @entity8 for blocks -- and when it was over , a five - story apartment building and its neighbor were gone			1
after wednesday morning 's deadly building explosion in @entity15 , squads of firefighters dug through piles of shattered bricks and beams			1
ladder trucks sprayed water into the gap where the buildings once stood			2
as detective @entity23 , a @entity24 police spokesman , put it : " 1644 @entity26 appears not to be there anymore			1
" along with that five - story apartment building , with a @entity30 evangelical church on the first floor , a neighboring piano store and the four floors above it collapsed in the blast			1
one nearby resident , @entity35 , told @entity0 she was trapped in her apartment down the block for a short time afterward			1
her stepmother had to sneak in through the back to try and open the door for her , she said			2
" my neighbors came banging on my door			0
i guess they were evacuating the building , and i could n't get out -- my door was jammed , " she said			0
" everything off my windowsill fell , and i guess the impact of the explosion jammed the door as well			1
" something similar happened to @entity52 , who had just returned to her apartment in one of the adjoining buildings after taking her children to school			0
then the windows broke out , and " the walls came tumbling down , " @entity52 said			0
a neighbor helped her out of her apartment , because the door was stuck in its frame			0
and she and her neighbors will have to find someplace else to stay temporarily			0
" we ca n't go back for the next couple of days , " @entity52 said			0
three blocks away , the blast knocked @entity68 off his feet as he brushed his teeth before work			1
he told @entity0 's sister network @entity72 that his first thoughts were a possible terrorist attack , " as @entity24 , we tend to do , " or maybe a derailment of the nearby @entity77 commuter line			1
" i went to my back window , because i 'm on the very top floor , " he said			0
looking down the street , he saw " a bunch of people just running , as if they were running towards something			0
" authorities suspect the explosion was the result of a gas leak reported a short time before			1
seven blocks away , @entity88 could feel his apartment shake and saw others " pouring out of the apartment buildings at 116th and @entity92			1
" he followed himself , watching as firefighters hauled gurneys into the wall of smoke to bring out the wounded			0
" i can see in front of me about 50 feet up until the explosion , and then it gets pretty thick , " @entity88 told @entity0			1
@entity101 , the head of the @entity15 & the @entity102 , called the surrounding area " a community in transition			1
" its population of 100,000 - plus was once largely @entity108			0
in the late 1950s , large numbers of @entity110 moved in -- in part because of the similarities between their native @entity113 and the @entity108 still spoken there			0
the 1990s brought a growing @entity116 population , and now the area is being gentrified , @entity101 said			0
it 's home to a lot of mom - and - pop businesses and restaurants , and the @entity123 - @entity122 is building a new dormitory in the area , he said			1
the full toll was uncertain early wednesday afternoon , but at least three people had died , dozens were hurt and about 10 were unaccounted for			0
the suspected cause was a gas leak that had been reported only 15 minutes before the explosion , mayor @entity128 told reporters			1
" this is a tragedy of the worst kind , because there was no indication in time to save people , " he said			0
among the missing was 67 - year - old @entity139 , whose nieces and godson awaited word near the ruins of her building			1
@entity145 said the family had given her aunt 's name to the office of her city councilwoman , which was canvassing hospitals to track down the injured -- " and she 's still not on any of those lists			1
" " she 's a dedicated worker			1
she works at a doctor 's office for many years now			2
so they 're worried as well , " @entity154 said			0
" they have n't heard from her			0
today 's her assigned day off			2
" another niece , @entity158 , said her " sassy , spicy " aunt rarely fails to answer her phone -- " and if she misses it because she did n't get to it in time , she calls me right back			0
" " i 'm hoping , thinking that the reason she has n't been in one of the lists is because she 's so involved helping somebody else that was injured from the building -- that she has n't taken toll to herself because that 's how she is , " @entity158 said			2
@entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			2
