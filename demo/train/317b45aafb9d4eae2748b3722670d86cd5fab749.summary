@entity51 was also unusually light on @entity52 , a recommended alternative route for motorists traveling to @entity55			1
and parking lots at @entity57 , typically packed on a sunny saturday , were relatively empty			0
the closure of the 405 is being deemed such a potentially calamitous event that locals called it " @entity34			2
" that 's because southern @entity20 is notorious for its love affair with the car and its reluctance to embrace public transportation			2
one of the busiest freeways in the country , the 405 is one of two mountain passes in the heart of @entity0 and is the major coastal artery connecting southern @entity20 with the rest of the state			1

a year from now , crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the @entity98 bridge , officials said			2
@entity2 said officials carried out " an unprecedented " campaign urging motorists to stay put or use public transportation			1
" it does n't have to be ' @entity34			0
' that 's why we have done so much outreach to the public , " the mayor said			2
the weekend construction project should be completed by 5 a.m. monday to accommodate the morning rush hour , officials said			0
the project also calls for adding a car - pool lane in each direction , creating " the largest hov system in the world " at 48.6 miles in length between the @entity123 and @entity124 , said @entity125 , the @entity30 's director for @entity0 and @entity128 counties			1
the two - year project will replace two more bridges , also to accommodate the widening of the 405 , and will improve about two dozen on - off ramps and add 18 miles of sound - deadening walls for nearby residents , @entity125 said			1
" this is a big project that is much needed , and it will be a great benefit to the public , " @entity125 said			0
the 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country , carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the @entity143 , a critical artery connecting @entity31 along the coast			1
the 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former @entity150 player @entity149 used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994			2
the highway also cuts through the west side of @entity0 , an area that includes the high - status communities of @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity57			1

there is an app , or several , for " @entity34			0
" @entity170 has partnered with @entity171 , the mobile social traffic and navigation app , to help navigate the traffic			0
" the app provides free turn - by - turn gps navigation based on the live conditions of the road , " the station said			0
celebrities are even tweeting -- cheekily -- about this weekend 's affront to the @entity0 driving experience			1
twitter titan and actor @entity182 has gotten into the act : " @entity185 askd me 2tweet : 405fwy btwn 10 & 101 will b closed july16 - 17			0
in xchange i would like a free pass on that stoplight tickt it was yellow			0
" when shown a copy of the tweet while he was being interviewed on @entity1 , the mayor laughed about the request to fix the ticket			0
