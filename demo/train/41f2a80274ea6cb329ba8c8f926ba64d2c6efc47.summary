@entity0 -- the @entity2 released a study wednesday that claims children were safer from sex abuse in the @entity2 than when at home or school			1
the report was prepared by a psychiatric expert hired by the @entity2 to review so - called " perversion files " kept by the organization from 1970 to 1991			1
a newspaper review of the files published last week said they showed scouting officials " failed to report hundreds of alleged child molesters to police and often hid the allegations from parents and the public			1
" in response , the @entity2 released what it said is an " independent review " by a @entity25 psychiatry professor wednesday , ahead of the " increased media attention " it expects with the release of more files			1
" i believe that these files show that children in @entity34 were safer and less likely to experience inappropriate sexual behavior in scouting than in their own families , schools and during other community activities supervised by adults , " dr. @entity30 wrote in her report			2
sex abuse files prompt calls for @entity44 ousters the @entity46 looked at 1,600 " ineligible volunteer " files obtained through a 1992 lawsuit in @entity49 against the @entity2 , the newspaper said			1
the " perversion files " were a blacklist of alleged sexual molesters , it said			1
the @entity55 , a sex abuse support group , said it was " very upset " by @entity59 's assertion that children were safer in the @entity2			1
" that 's an unsubstantiated , self - serving claim that sounds more like the writing of a spin doctor than a real doctor , " snap director @entity61 said			1
@entity55 called on the @entity2 last week to oust any official still with the organization who was involved in covering up child sex crimes			1
the @entity2 , in a statement last week , said it " continuously enhanced its multi-tiered policies and procedures , which now include background checks , comprehensive training programs , and safety policies			2
" the organization 's current education and training programs to protect children from abuse " are among the best in the youth - serving community , " @entity2 spokesman @entity76 said			1
the @entity2 , in an open letter published wednesday , said it would review the next batch of files to be released , covering 1965 to 1985 , to " ensure that all good - faith suspicion of abuse has been reported to law enforcement			1
" the @entity46 reported that while the @entity2 learned of most of the abuse allegations after they were reported to authorities , the organization was told about more than 500 instances from boys , parents , staff members or anonymous tips			1
" in about 400 of those cases -- 80 % -- there is no record of @entity34 officials reporting the allegations to police , " the @entity46 reported			0
" in more than 100 of the cases , officials actively sought to conceal the alleged abuse or allowed the suspects to hide it			2
" @entity59 's report said her " review of these files indicates that the reported rate of sexual abuse in @entity34 has been very low			1
" " these files tell us precisely what researchers already knew , and have known for many years : some small number of men will use a position of trust and access to young people to pursue illegal sexual gratification , " @entity59 wrote			0
" this is a sad reality that has been with us throughout human history			0
" the professor noted that only 25 cases were documented from 1980 , when there were about 1.1 million adults involved in @entity34			0
" this indicates that 0.002 percent -- or 2 per 100,000 -- of all registered @entity34 - involved adults in that year came to the attention of @entity2 because of alleged inappropriate sexual behavior with a child or adolescent , " @entity59 said			1
" this suggests that youth were safer in scouting than in society at large			0
" @entity59 also disputed that the documents were " secret files " of hidden abuse			0
" the files show a significant amount of public knowledge of the offenders and their unlawful acts , " she said			0
" for example , over 60 % of the files made available to the public include some kind of public information			0
these public domain sources included newspaper articles , police reports , criminal justice records , and records of civil litigation			0
" most of the men involved " were arrested at some point in their lives for a sex crime			0
" these data indicate that more often than not , the police , the courts , and the public were aware of inappropriate sexual behavior having been attributed to these individuals			0
" opinion : what scout abuse scandal teaches us the professor also asserted that the " claims of abuse were not swept under the carpet and ignored			1
rather , suspected offenders were pursued and often times barred from scouting over their fervent objection and at times even the opinion of the local community			0
" the " small number " of alleged offenders allowed back into @entity34 were permitted " because ( they ) had sought and received psychiatric treatment , " she wrote			0
@entity59 concluded that the @entity2 ' system of ridding the organization of sex abusers " was not perfect , and mistakes clearly occurred , " but it " functioned well in keeping many unfit adults out of scouting			2
" @entity55 's director said he was " highly skeptical " of @entity59 's claim that the @entity2 ' system functioned well			2
" compared with what ? she apparently bases this on one source of information : the @entity2 files			2
" however , @entity61 said , " initial reports seem to show that the @entity2 ' response to sexual abuse is improving			2
" " at the same time , we stand by our call to wait and see what real reform -- if any -- actually comes of these new developments , " he added			0
" for example , @entity59 's report indicates that there were still some abusers who were allowed back into scouting after going through ' psychiatric treatment			0
' we would argue that no one who has been credibly accused of child sex abuse be allowed back into @entity34 , period			1
" the report " gives us some slight hope for change within the @entity2 , but we remain cautious , " @entity61 said			2
