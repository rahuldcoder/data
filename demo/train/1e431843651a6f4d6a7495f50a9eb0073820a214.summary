@entity4 the @entity1 shepherd and his human companions in law enforcement won an important @entity6 appeal on tuesday over vehicle searches for drugs and contraband			1
the justices found that a positive " hit " from the sniff of a well trained police dog could establish probable cause for the search of a vehicle			1
" the question -- similar to every inquiry intro probable cause -- is whether all the facts surrounding a dog 's alert , viewed through the lens of common sense , would make a reasonably prudent person think that a search would reveal contraband or evidence of a crime , " said justice @entity17			1
" and here , @entity4 's did			0
" this case and a separate and still pending appeal over police intrusions into homes and cars could have a far - reaching impact on when a person 's private contents can be subjected to a search without clear probable cause or a valid warrant			1
dogs at center of police search arguments the @entity45 's @entity44 grants the " right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures			1
" the issue of citizen privacy has been particularly acute since the 2001 @entity57 attacks on the @entity58			1
federal and state governments have stepped up surveillance of suspected terrorists and their allies and high - risk targets , like government buildings and shopping malls			0
the case decided by the @entity6 on tuesday involved @entity68 , who was stopped by a sheriff 's deputy in @entity70 outside @entity71 in 2006 for an expired license tag			1
the officer brought in a @entity1 shepherd police dog , @entity4 , who focused on the truck 's door handle			0
a subsequent search produced pills in the vehicle that are used to make methamphetamine			0
@entity68 was charged and later pleaded no contest , but the state high court later reversed the conviction			0
those justices found the dog unreliable			0
a few weeks after the initial search , @entity68 was stopped and the dog again alerted the door handle for the presence of drugs			0
this time , none were found			0
the @entity95 high court concluded that the state 's general assertion a dog was sufficiently " trained " and " certified " was not enough alone to establish probable cause justifying vehicle searches			2
but the @entity58 @entity6 disagreed , saying @entity4 's training records established that he was reliable in detecting drugs and that @entity68 " failed to undermine that showing			1
" the @entity6 has in recent years generally given law enforcement some latitude to conduct its in a heightened security environment , but not without some checks			2
the current cases also come as recent studies have raised questions about the accuracy of canine drug alerts			2
@entity95 state officials applauded the opinion			0
" this victory is paramount to preserving our law enforcement officers ' ability to use police dog alerts to locate illegal drugs and arrest those who possess them , " said @entity95 attorney general @entity115			0
" the @entity6 correctly held that a police dog 's reliability is determined through a common - sense evaluation of the relevant circumstances , rather than through a rigid set of judge - created requirements , " @entity115 said			1
the case is : @entity130 ( 11 - 817 ) .			2

@entity6 says alerts from trained dogs can *trigger* probable cause for search of car
this case and another could have far - reaching impact on search questions
citizen privacy has been a *key* issue since 2001 terror attacks on the @entity58
