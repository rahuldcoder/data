-- it was n't exactly the miracle on ice but the @entity4 pulled off a minor upset when it controversially beat @entity6 3 - 2 in a nail - biting penalty shootout that highlighted @entity8 at the @entity9			1
thirty - four years ago @entity11 's men stunned the mighty @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 to take gold in the ice hockey competition , one of the biggest shocks in a team event in @entity21 history			1
saturday 's group game marked the first time the @entity4 contested an @entity21 hockey game in @entity6 since that memorable occasion and none other than @entity6 president @entity27 was in the stands to witness proceedings in his hockey - mad nation			1
@entity6 and other @entity31 have long since made their mark in the @entity33 and the @entity34 is over but it was a match neither team wanted to lose			2
@entity37 emerged as the hero for the @entity4 , outshining @entity6 captain @entity39 -- who plies his trade for the @entity41 in the @entity33			1
@entity37 scored all four of the @entity4 's goals in the shootout that went to a whopping eight rounds			1
blog : superpower showdown had everything " my hands are a little tingling , my feet are tingling , " @entity37 told reporters			2
" it was pretty nerve - racking out there			0
we knew it would take 65 minutes and then some ( to win )			0
" but the referees were in the spotlight , too , disallowing what would have been the winning goal for @entity6 with less than five minutes remaining in the third period after the net was knocked out of place			2
although @entity6 realistically is n't in danger of failing to advance to the quarterfinals , it slipped behind the 2 - 0 @entity4 in @entity66 @entity39 opened the scoring midway in the second period , only for @entity69 to equalize late in the period			1
the @entity4 reclaimed the advantage when @entity72 netted past @entity73 but @entity6 tied proceedings through @entity39 's second past @entity76 midway in the third			1
then , @entity78 thought he handed @entity6 a famous victory , though the referees did n't allow his effort			2
" i do n't know what happened there , but definitely it was a goal , " @entity6 superstar @entity82 told reporters			2
" nobody touched the net			0
their goalie touched the net and put it out			0
" quick , however , said he did n't know the net was loose			0
@entity73 saved a breakaway to force the shootout , where @entity37 registered the winner after @entity96 missed in the shootout			1
" i did ( feel pressure ) a little bit , but then the puck hits your stick and you start skating , " said @entity37			1
" it 's just you and the goalie			0
i was fortunate enough to keep ( @entity73 ) guessing and @entity105 did his great job			0
" still no joy for @entity4 in speed skating the @entity109 won a medal in the men 's 1,500 - meter speed skating event			1
in short , nothing new , then			0
the gold medalist was a surprise , though , in the form of @entity116 -- who became @entity119 's first speed skating @entity21 champion			1
the part - time fireman edged @entity122 by three - thousandths of a second in a race so tight that initially @entity122 was listed as the winner			0
" when i saw i had won , it was an unbelievable feeling , " @entity116 said			0
@entity122 was far from euphoric as he tallied the @entity109 ' 13th medal in speed skating -- tying a @entity131 record -- in @entity132			1
" i should be happy winning silver but this feels like a huge loss , " he said			0
" at the moment it feels like all my hard work and my consistent races were for nothing			0
after such a season you know you can do it , and i felt pretty good			0
" @entity4 @entity145 , who slumped in the 1,000 meters as the two - time defending champion , placed a distant 11th even after the @entity4 team changed its @entity149 skin suits that were thought to be a contributing factor to its woes			1
it reverted to a previous version of the suits			0
@entity119 landed another gold saturday , with @entity156 completing a personal double by adding the large hill title to his crown in the normal hill event			1
@entity161 became the third man to pull off the sweep at the same @entity21			2

current overall leader @entity179 claimed silver -- adding to her gold in the super combined -- and @entity165 's @entity182 took the bronze			1
@entity179 and @entity184 were well behind @entity170 , more than half - a - second adrift			2
almost half of the starters did n't complete the run			0
" i 've had races where i went through the finish line and i knew this was it -- ' this was a winner			0
' but this was not one of them , " the 24 - year - old @entity170 told reporters			2
" i only realized what had happened when i stood on the top of the podium , " she added			0
" my feeling is indescribable			0
i just hope the realization will sink in the way i imagined it so i can properly enjoy myself by this evening			0
