-- the touchdown catch that was n't			2
whatever you call it , do n't call the controversial call by replacement refs in the @entity10 - @entity11 game a catalyst for the tentative labor deal with @entity15 referees , commissioner @entity4 said thursday			1
" it may have pushed the parties farther along , but we were really in intensive negotiations for the last two weeks , " @entity4 told reporters in a conference call thursday to discuss the agreement , reached late wednesday			2
@entity4 also said he was sorry the league felt it had to resort to the replacements , few of whom had any previous @entity15 officiating experience			1
many were high school or low - level college officials who hold down myriad other jobs , from schoolteachers to attorneys			2
" we worked as hard as we could and we did the best we could , " said @entity34 , a fill - in line judge who lives in @entity35			0
" none of us felt like we could replace the regular guys			0
you ca n't replace that sort of ability en masse			2
" @entity34 , who spent 15 years as a @entity43 official , said he and his colleagues never imagined working this long			2
he thought they 'd work one game and go home			2
while the officials were excoriated in the media , @entity34 said the players were very professional			2
" i ca n't think of one unkind thing i could say about them , " he said			2
" @entity4 declined to criticize the replacements despite weeks of botched calls that raised the ire of fans nationwide			2
" everything they did , every call , was magnified , " @entity4 said			0
" they kept the game going			0
they were incredibly focused and dedicated			0
" the eight - year deal -- the longest ever for officials , according to the @entity15 -- gives the union referees a pay raise and keeps their pension program in place for five years			1
it suspends a lockout that began before the league 's preseason , leading to a series of gaffes that climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the @entity81 to walk away with a victory in monday night 's nationally televised game			1
the league acknowledged tuesday that the @entity10 should have won , but allowed the result of the game to stand			0
fans and players rejoiced in the news that regular referees would return , beginning with thursday night 's game between the @entity92 and the @entity93			1
" @entity95 thought i would be excited for the refs to come back to work but it 's about time , " @entity92 receiver @entity94 tweeted thursday			1
" it was definitely necessary ! " photos : blown calls in place of the replacement referees , most of whom had officiated no more than a handful of pro games , the league put together a veteran crew with a combined 70 seasons of @entity15 experience to handle thursday night 's game at @entity93			1
before the game , fans stood and clapped for the officials as the seven men tipped their caps			1
@entity4 said it was challenging to figure out how to get regular referees back on the field less than 24 hours after striking the tentative deal , but not for lack of enthusiasm among the officials to get back to work			1
" they wanted to do what they love doing and make a contribution to the game , and that 's a tribute to them , " @entity4 said			1
while they have not called a game since last season , the league 's veteran crews will be ready to go , said retired official @entity136			1
" these guys have been working every week , really since may , to get ready for the season , through conference calls , through video , through meetings of their own , " @entity136 said			0
" and that 's something that the officials have done simply because they have enough pride in what they do that they wanted to be ready			1
" @entity145 : @entity15 's most embarrassing moments the eight - year deal , which must be ratified by union members , includes details about officials ' pensions and retirement benefits , and adds a pay bump from $ 149,000 a year in 2011 to $ 173,000 in 2013			1
the pay will rise to $ 205,000 by 2019			0
the agreement will also allow the @entity15 to hire some officials on a year - round basis and hire additional referees so they can be trained			1
" this agreement supports long - term reforms that will make officiating better			0
the teams , players and fans want and deserve both consistency and quality in officiating , " @entity4 said			0
what the refs were negotiating the return of the league 's regular referees wo n't put an end to controversial calls , said retired @entity15 player @entity174			1
but it will raise the respect level between coaches and players and officials , @entity174 said			0
" there 's still going to be arguing with referees , " he said			2
" they 're still going to make bad calls			0
but now we 're going to know that it 's coming from a base of knowledge			0
these guys know what they 're talking about and they 're going to have an argument for why they do what they do on the field			0
" fired up over @entity15 referees ? share your thoughts			1
the deal came almost exactly 48 hours after the controversial ending of the monday night game , which the @entity81 won 14 - 12 after replacement officials gave possession of a disputed ball , and a touchdown , to @entity204 receiver @entity203			1
in what became a widely mocked symbol of the quality of officiating by the replacements , a photo from that game shows two officials in the end zone displaying competing signals : one indicating a touchdown , the other an interception			2
the result generated intense and immediate criticism of the league -- even president @entity222 weighed in tuesday urging a quick resolution			0
on thursday , @entity225 spokesman @entity224 said @entity222 was " very pleased " with the resolution			0
@entity4 said he was not surprised by the outcry			0
" i 've come to learn in the @entity15 , particularly with the popularity of the game and the influence it has in today 's society , not much surprises me about what happens in the @entity15 , " he said			1
despite prodding by reporters , he declined to closely dissect the play that ended monday night 's game beyond the statement the @entity15 issued tuesday			1
in that statement , the @entity15 said the replacement refs should have called an offensive pass interference penalty on @entity204 that would have ended the game , but supported the referees ' decision not to overturn the ruling on the catch			1
@entity4 also declined to grade the replacements , saying that was n't part of his duties			0
but he warned fans that mistakes will still happen , even with the return of the veterans			0
" it 's not realistic to think that officiating will be perfect , " he said			0
much as it was after the monday game , @entity255 was buzzing with discussion of the deal			1
for a while , in the early morning , the name of one of the @entity15 's more iconic officials , the heavily muscled @entity260 , was one of the most - discussed topics among @entity255 users in the @entity266			1
" i 've never been more excited to see another man 's biceps than this sunday to see @entity260 back officiating , " a @entity255 user named @entity268 wrote			0
" @entity0 's @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			0
