even as @entity4 remained consumed by the government shutdown , @entity1 @entity0 hoping to jump start the stalled debate over immigration reform put a new proposal on the table wednesday			1
" the @entity11 people have spoken , " said rep. @entity8 , @entity9			1
" they want @entity12 to take on this issue			0
" rep. @entity14 , @entity15 , said he has no doubt there are enough @entity1 votes to pass a bill that " fixes our broken immigration system , including provide a path to legal residency and ultimately to citizenship to millions of people who work hard everyday in this country			0
" sound familiar ? it should			0
in many ways , the @entity0 say the bill they 're introducing is similar to the immigration reform measure passed by the @entity31 in june			1
but there 's at least one key difference : this version does n't include the plan to build more border fencing and step up security with thousands more border patrol agents			2
" we are not introducing the perfect bill			0
but we are introducing a comprehensive reform bill that provides that space for compromise that takes the very hard and tough work that was done in the @entity31 and takes the very detailed and specific work that was done in the @entity1 and so , we put them both together , " @entity8 said			2
" and we have taken out the very controversial @entity47 ( border security amendment ) , which i think everyone understood has opposition not only in elements in the @entity0 but very strong opposition of members of the @entity1			2
" the proposed @entity1 bill does n't have any @entity57 backers who 've signed on yet			1
still , rep. @entity58 , @entity0 minority leader , described the bill as " 100 % bipartisan " because it combines measures that have gotten support on both sides of the aisle in the @entity1 and the @entity31			1
supporters of immigration reform applauded the @entity0 ' announcement wednesday			0
but it 's uncertain whether the measure will ever be up for debate on the @entity1 floor , since @entity71 house speaker @entity71 is the one who would need to schedule a vote on the matter -- something he has n't done yet .			0

@entity1 bill does n't include border security measures passed by the @entity31
@entity1 @entity0 say they 're ready to move on immigration reform
@entity8 : " the @entity11 people have spoken -- they want @entity12 to take on this issue "
@entity58 says the proposed bill is bipartisan , but no @entity57 have signed on yet
