-- if @entity2 is to win a fifth @entity4 @entity3 , he 'll need something akin to a miracle			1
that 's because he 'll start well adrift of the pack after the back of his @entity10 caught fire in qualifying -- the second consecutive saturday he 's suffered misfortune			1
it was on his first qualifying lap , too			0
@entity2 was n't hurt but with his chassis needing replacing , it means a start from pit lane			2
his teammate and @entity22 leader @entity21 had no such issues , recording the fastest time			1
last week in qualifying for the @entity25 @entity3 , a brake issue led to a @entity27 crash and meant he began 20th on the grid on race day but he put in a stellar drive to rise to third			1
@entity2 , who bettered the field in practice friday and earlier saturday , was the first to point out that overtaking opportunities are n't as great in @entity35 as they were in @entity25			2
" it 's a shame , especially when you do the practice sessions with not too many problems , " @entity2 said in a television interview aired by @entity37			1
" i did n't even get a lap this time			0
last time i got maybe two laps			0
" i ca n't believe it 's happened again			0
this is not a track you can really overtake on so coming from last to the podium is a lot less likely			0
" @entity2 's mishap gives @entity21 the chance to extend his 14 - point lead over @entity2 in the individual standings			1
and although the @entity25 said he would have preferred to go head - to - head with @entity2 , he felt sunday 's race would now be " easier			1
" unsurprisingly , he does n't plan on taking many risks at the @entity58			0
" it makes it easier of course because he is my competitor , " @entity21 was quoted as saying by @entity59			2
" it 's a free opportunity tomorrow			0
" i need to play it safe and avoid any unnecessary things happening , and get as many points as possible			0
" i would prefer to be out there battling with @entity2			2
that would give me the maximum adrenaline rush			0
it wo n't be a gloves - off battle with @entity2 , but i am still very , very happy			2
" @entity21 clocked a best time of one minute , 22.715 seconds , bettering reigning world champion @entity73 of @entity74 by 0.486 seconds , @entity76 ' @entity75 and @entity74 's @entity77 , who is a distant third in the driver standings .			1
