-- weeks after a policy change that sparked privacy concerns , @entity1 has rolled out a new feature that will give users a monthly update to help them keep track of their activity across @entity1 's multiple sites and tools			1
it 's called @entity11 , and users can receive it via e-mail with a link to a password - protected personal page			1
the feature was announced wednesday in a post on @entity1 's official blog			1
" every day , we aim to make technology so simple and intuitive that you stop thinking about it -- we want @entity1 to work so well it just blends into your life , " @entity17 , a product manager for @entity1 , wrote in the post			2
" but sometimes it 's helpful to step back and take stock of what you 're doing online			0
" the report is not automatic , meaning users will have to sign up to receive it			0
based on a sample report , information such as your number of @entity1 searches , your most popular search topics and the number of e-mails sent and received will be included			1
it also will show locations where your account was used and the devices that were used to sign into it , which @entity17 called an extra layer of security			0
" knowing more about your own account activity also can help you take steps to protect your @entity50 , " he wrote			0
" for example , if you notice sign - ins from countries where you have n't been or devices you 've never owned , you can change your password immediately and sign up for the extra level of security provided by two - step verification			2
" on march 1 , @entity1 instigated a new privacy policy in which it creates a single profile of each user based on their activity across all of its many products -- from search to @entity67 to mobile devices that run on @entity1 's @entity70 operating system			1
privacy advocates , including some in @entity72 , fear that puts too much personal information in the company 's hands			0
but @entity1 said it would n't be collecting any new information -- just collating what data it already had in a way that would be more clear and help create new products and features for its users			2
wednesday 's blog post from @entity1 made no mention of the new privacy policy			1
but many tech observers were quick to make the connection , saying it looks like a way to make users more comfortable			0
" if you 're confused about what @entity1 does and does n't know about your online activity , take heart : @entity1 is letting you in on the secret , " @entity95 writer @entity94 wrote			2
others saw potential for another goal behind the rollout -- reminding folks how ubiquitous the web giant has become online			0
" while the report is something of a data nerds ' dream , its timely arrival hints at another purpose , " wrote @entity104 of @entity105			0
" the new @entity11 report offers a way for users to see exactly what they 're doing on @entity1 , and how much of their life involves the use of @entity1 's products			1

@entity120 gives users a monthly look at what they did online
the feature comes weeks after @entity1 's new privacy policy became active
e-mail , search , log - ins and other @entity1 actions will be included
