-- icy beers , empty beaches			1
it 's a compelling image , but it captures only a feeble percentage of the diversity and excellence that imbues one of the most incredible countries in the world			1
here are 10 things @entity11 does better than anywhere else			1
celebrating death plenty of cultures do ancestor worship			1
but who else turns the commemoration of their dearly departed into an annual fiesta of art , food and community ? on november 1 , aka the @entity25 , @entity24 put together ofrendas ( shrines ) for loved ones who have passed away			1
every ofrenda includes pictures of the deceased , food , drinks , skull - shaped candies , candles and cempasuchil , the @entity36 marigold or flower of the dead			1
the belief is that souls of children come back to earth to visit family and friends on november 1 and the souls of adults do the same on november 2			1
@entity25 festivals take place across @entity11			1
three of the most elaborate are held in @entity50 ( in @entity51 , @entity52 ) , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity54			2
horn sections from symphony orchestras to oompah bands to soul and @entity62 horn sections , everyone loves a blast of brass			2
whereas most countries tend to save their horns for parties and special occasions , however , @entity11 kicks out the brass jams on a daily basis			2
where else can you hear tubas -- actual tubas ! -- laying down bass lines on the radio every hour of the week ? it all comes down to bandas , the heart of both traditional and popular genres of @entity24 music			1
bandas are typically comprised of 10 to 20 musicians who play brass instruments , woodwinds and various percussion			2
every @entity11 traveler is charmed by mariachi , but bandas are a part of several broader genres , the most characteristic being ranchera , quebradita and corridos			2
@entity92 @entity11 's national liquor is a worldwide bar standard , with exports to 96 countries			2
but do n't come to @entity11 expecting to impress locals by chugging a syrupy sweet margarita or knocking down manly shots all night			2
@entity92 is meant to be sipped and savored , like fine whiskey , which , as any @entity24 will tell you , the best tequila can compete with			1
you can get a taste of the top - shelf stuff on the @entity106 , which includes some of the country 's most renowned distilleries			1
alternates are the @entity111 tour operated by @entity112 and the @entity114 tour			2
curing hangovers @entity24 parties are notorious for going berserk in the blink of a bleary eye			1
that , of course , leads to a familiar disaster the following morning			2
fortunately , @entity11 's kitchens spring to life with the best hangover grub on the planet			2
wake up , guzzle water then inhale some spicy chilaquiles , carnitas ( pork ) or barbacoa ( sheep ) tacos with hot sauce and plenty of revitalizing grease -- maybe slam a light breakfast beer if you 're in really rough shape -- and you 'll be back making requests from the band by nightfall			1
double entendre ( @entity143 ) called " albur " in @entity146 , double entendre is n't just a linguistic trick for @entity24 , it 's an art form requiring a nimble mind and the ability to convey smart but subtle messages , often laced with sexual or r - rated undertones			1
many languages , of course , employ veiled connotations and witty wordplay			2
but albur is so important in @entity11 that there 's a national tournament to crown the best alburero			2
the current champ is @entity162 , who 's won the competition every year since 1997 , defeating men and women			2
she even teaches albur courses			2
still not convinced @entity24 take double entendre more seriously than anyone else ? what other country has a day devoted to the subtle intricacies of its language ? in @entity11 , @entity173 is celebrated on march 1			1
@entity175 ( course of @entity177 ) classes are held at the @entity178 ( @entity179 55 , colonia @entity180 , @entity182 , @entity52 ) ; free admission ; participants receive a diploma			0
@entity186 @entity187 does a pretty fair job as the center of the faith and it has some decent paintings on its ceiling			0
but its population of 800 souls is n't exactly staggering			0
@entity11 , by contrast , ranks second in the world for number of @entity198 ( @entity199 is first , the @entity201 third ) and , according to the @entity202 and @entity203 , 83.9 % of the @entity24 are @entity204			1
nothing says " @entity204 " like a reverence for the country 's seemingly endless manifestations of the @entity209			0
which may be why the priest @entity211 carried a symbolic flag of @entity213 when he led the opening stages of the @entity215 in 1810			0
@entity216 is the most venerated @entity217 in @entity11 , maybe the world			0
the @entity219 in @entity52 is also one of the most important pilgrimage sites in @entity11 , reportedly the most visited @entity209 shrine in the world			0
each december 12 , about 5 million pilgrims from across @entity11 visit the @entity219 to thank the @entity217 for her favors or to ask for a miracle			0
basilica of @entity216 of @entity228 , @entity229 1 , col. @entity213 , @entity232 @entity231 , @entity52 ; +52 55 5118 0500 quick lunches known around the country as @entity235 , tacos , tortas , tamales and tostadas are part of the everyday life			1
@entity24 are constantly on the go , so it 's no wonder puestos and changarros ( food stands ) can be found on practically every corner			1
it does n't matter if you 're in the subway , leaving school or taking a lunch break away from the office -- @entity11 's streets offer endless options for a fast and delicious meal cooked right in front of you with super-fresh ingredients			1
soap operas in 1958 , @entity261 produced " @entity262 " ( " @entity263 " ) , the first @entity24 telenovela ( soap opera )			1
fifty - six years later , its successor @entity266 has produced a whopping 740 telenovelas			0
the formula has n't changed much			0
a man and woman fall in love but , for tragic reasons , ca n't be together			0
after overcoming obstacles they finally get married			0
fifteen years after exporting its first soap opera , " @entity276 " ( " the @entity277 " ) , @entity266 has found a rich market outside @entity11			0
of all countries that export soap operas , @entity11 ships out the most , carving niches in other @entity146 - speaking countries , as well as @entity283 , the @entity201 , @entity279 and @entity280			0
) @entity266 is n't the only network producing successful telenovelas			0
@entity290 and @entity291 also create top - notch weepers			0
wrestling costumes professional wrestling ( lucha libre ) may be more @entity296 north of the border , and grittier in other countries , but nowhere is it as full of pathos as in @entity11			0
those hilarious / spooky masks are n't just fun to look at , they 're a major part of the drama			0
removing one from an opponent 's head is one of the greatest triumphs and most thrilling moments in lucha libre			0
matches are held at @entity11 in @entity52 on tuesdays ( 7:30 p.m. ) , fridays ( 8:30 p.m. ) and sundays ( 5 p.m. )			0
tickets can be purchased from @entity312			0
polite lies @entity24 ' deep fear of appearing rude has given us a bred - in - the - bone aversion to uttering the word " no. " instead -- and unfortunately for those unfamiliar with the rules of courtesy here -- we 've developed a talent for white lies that allow us to say yes to fulfilling any request			1
even if we ca n't do anything about it			0
white lies can be as clichéd as " the dog ate my homework " or as morbid as " my beloved great aunt has suddenly developed pancreatic cancer			0
" but the granddaddy of polite lies is " ahorita			0
" " @entity337 " literally means " right now , " but it 's almost never that			0
when a @entity24 tells you they 'll do something " ahorita , " be prepared to take a seat , because the wait can be long			1
think of ahorita as the @entity24 art of procrastination -- it 's been passed from generation to generation -- a term that can mean anything from " in 10 minutes " to " in three weeks			1
" @entity352 's cousin in crime is " i 'm on my way			0
" this really means , " i 'm on my way to finishing this tv show , maybe getting off the couch , calling my sister , taking a shower , grabbing a snack and actually leaving home to meet you			0
" you 've been warned -- we 're great at it ! what do you love most about @entity11 ? leave a comment			1
@entity369 is a @entity24 journalist who writes for @entity370 , @entity371 and @entity372			1
she 's a regular contributor to several @entity24 magazines and is the only @entity376 journalist and youngest ever to be nominated for the @entity377 .			1

@entity25 is a @entity24 tradition to honor loved ones who have passed on with art , food and communal *activities*
not all tequila is for slamming -- the best stuff can compete with a fine whiskey and should be savored
tacos , tortas , tamales and tostadas -- no lunch ever came quicker , or more satisfying , than one provided by @entity235
