@entity0 -- @entity2 will likely need two to three more months to bring an end to the disaster at the @entity6 nuclear power plant , a nuclear industry official said saturday			1
@entity8 , the deputy director of the @entity9 of @entity2 , said saturday that it was likely to take that long to restore normal cooling systems for the damaged reactors at @entity6			1
the plant 's coolant systems were knocked out by the march 11 tsunami , causing three reactors to overheat and producing what @entity2 's government has designated a top - scale nuclear accident			1
@entity8 's organization is an association of nuclear engineers , scientists and professors , and it issued a friday report that he called " our best effort to imagine what the core looks like			1
" that report concluded that the zirconium alloy sheaths that surround the reactor 's fuel rods ruptured in the three units , sending pellets of molten uranium tumbling to the bottom of the reactors			1
the pellets are since believed to have cooled and solidified at the reactor bases , according to the report			0
the plant 's owner , the @entity42 , has said it ca n't provide a timeline for bringing the crisis to an end and would not discuss @entity8 's assessment saturday			1
" we are trying to do our utmost at this moment , " a company official told @entity1			0
but an adviser to prime minister @entity51 said the government wants to see some sort of plan by the end of april			2
" we will set up a goal for the cooling process soon , " the adviser , @entity56 , said during an appearance on the @entity59 satellite network saturday morning			2
@entity2 nuclear regulators declared the @entity6 accident a @entity64 7 on the @entity65 this week , putting the crisis on par with the april 1986 fire and explosion at the @entity71 plant in the @entity72			2
while authorities said the amount of radioactivity released was only 10 percent of the amount that spewed from @entity71 , it was far beyond the threshold for a @entity80 event			0
more than 78,000 people who lived within 20 kilometers ( 12.5 miles ) of the plant were ordered to flee their homes			0
another 60,000 - plus living in the next 10 kilometers were told to shelter indoors , and @entity2 's government ordered residents of several towns outside that danger zone that they would soon be evacuating due to the possibility of long - term health risks from radioactive particles released from the plant			1
@entity42 has said it has to drain highly radioactive water from the basements and service tunnels of the reactor units ' turbine plants before it can work on restoring normal cooling systems			1
but workers are also pumping up to 7 tons ( 1,850 gallons ) of water into the reactors every hour as an interim measure , and an unknown portion of that is leaking back into the plant			0
at the plant on saturday , workers continued preparations to start pumping water from the no. 2 turbine plant into a treatment facility for low - level radioactive waste			0
more than 9,000 tons of less - contaminated water that had been held there was dumped into the @entity116 last week in what @entity2 officials called an emergency measure to make room for fluid that had been leaking into the sea until april 6			2
crews have been laying fresh pipes to the treatment center and hope to start transferring water from unit 2 on sunday , the company said			0
but its capacity could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements , and engineers are still pouring hundreds of tons of water into the reactors every day to keep them cool			0
the treatment center could hold up to 30,000 tons of water , @entity42 said -- but that could be only a fraction of the volume now sloshing around in the turbine building basements , the company said .			0

industry *group* report says normal cooling may take 2 to 3 months
@entity42 wo n't comment on the *estimate*
