-- @entity1 was sitting in the doctor 's office with her diabetic mother in @entity5 , @entity6 , in 2009			1
" the doctor was talking to her about options and she wanted to try all of them to stay alive , " says @entity1			1
" i realized how brave she was , trying to keep her life			1
i was 382 pounds and killing myself			1
" she cried in the bathroom of the doctor 's office , returned home and took a picture of herself			1
( the image shown above			2
) this was a first day of the rest of her life			1
" i was finally ready and determined			2
taking that first picture was my way of making me accountable to this choice to start this journey , " says @entity1			1
" i wanted to have it on my phone to look at every day , especially when i was having not a great day			2
" @entity1 has been overweight for as long as she can remember			1
she recalls " plumping up " at 5 years old and weighing 200 pounds in junior high			1
" my family doctor said i needed to get the weight off and if i did n't , i was going to shorten my life , " says @entity1			1
" he gave me a piece of paper with four tips to lose weight			2
" have your own weight loss story to share ? visit @entity37 before the epiphany , she kept that piece of paper in her purse for months , even when she would change purses			2
and every time , she would look at it and think , " i 'll start tomorrow			2
" tomorrow finally came on august 17 , 2009			2
after snapping that photo , @entity1 went into her purse and pulled out the tips the doctor had given her : 1			1
eat 8 ounces of food every 3 hours 2			2
do not skip meals 4			2
do not tell anyone what you 're doing so that 's what she did -- or did n't do , really			2
almost two years later , @entity1 has dropped 232 pounds from her body and has trimmed her waist down to 26 inches ( a size 6 )			1
and she did it all without a trainer			0
" i 've always walked , no matter how hard it was , " says @entity1			1
" then i used @entity63 ' ' sweating to the @entity64 ' because it 's low - impact			0
now @entity66 , which is like @entity63 on speed			0
" she does n't go crazy with her workouts			0
she walks about five times a week , sweats to @entity63 twice a week and fits @entity66 in when she can			0
@entity1 ca n't even eat a full 8 ounces of food anymore -- her stomach has gotten so small -- and she needs to be very picky about what she eats			1
her body craves the " good food , " so she listens to it			0
her latest cravings have been fresh pineapples and mandarin oranges			0
do n't think that she 's a saint either			0
she still enjoys temptations ... within reason			0
" i still go out to eat and i still eat junk , " says @entity1			1
" my guilty pleasure for the last 8 months [ has been ] @entity85 fat free ice cream -- half cup a night			0
" when she goes out to eat , she orders a meal -- anything she wants -- and asks for a to - go box			0
it helps with eating healthy food portions , even if she 's noshing on her favorite meal : fried chicken fingers and deep fried potato chips			0
" out of sight , out of mind , " says @entity1			1
" i do n't get sick any more from eating too much			0
you just need to know portion control			0
i 'm accountable for what i put in my body			0
" the hardest thing for @entity1 was pushing through her plateaus			1
" i would lose [ weight ] for about seven days and then nothing for about 10 to 15 days , which was the hardest , " she says			0
but since losing hundreds of pounds , @entity1 has appeared on the " @entity106 " for a makeover and talks regularly in schools			1
" i tell the kids this does n't just mean weight loss ; if you put your mind to anything , nothing can stop you , " says @entity1			1
" if you think , ' this is what i 'm going to do , ' you can get anything done			0
" @entity1 gives all her credit to her supportive family , especially her husband , @entity120 , whom she has been married to for nearly 25 years			1
she remembers him saying , " i loved her at 382 and i love her now			0
i love her no matter what			0
she may look a little different , but she 's the same girl			0
" as a family , they are all living healthier lives and dropping the pounds together			2
but most importantly , @entity1 wants to be around to take care of her husband , 23 - and 19 - year - old sons , and elderly parents for as long as she can			1
and she loves every minute of her hectic , thinner life			2
" the one thing i can do that i could n't before is that i can cross my legs and get up and down off the floor , " says @entity1			1
she is trying new things that she never thought were possible			0
