if you 've traveled to , or through , @entity2 , you probably have one of two impressions			1
wow , that 's a big , crazy airport			0
wow , that traffic really sucked			0
maybe you got to spend a little time downtown for a convention or ballgame			2
and , sure , there were the highlights like the @entity13 , the @entity14 and the @entity15			0
but after that , unless you knew exactly where to look , you probably saw a lot of concrete , a lot of places that closed at 6 p.m. , and culinary and entertainment options just like the other roughly 430 @entity24 or 175 @entity25			0
here 's the good news : you 've been to @entity2			1
but you have n't really been to @entity2			1
get away from that street named @entity28 ( or one of the dozens of other streets we named @entity28 for your convenience ) , and there 's a city with a lot more to offer			2
the capital of the @entity37 has been called a small town trapped in a big city			2
in fact , it 's a lot of small towns , coexisting , for the most part , inside and alongside the borders of that big city			2
and like the long list of @entity50 storytellers who have called @entity2 home , if you spend enough time with it , it will share its secrets with you			1
good eats as a food - lover friend recently said , in @entity2 , you can go to dinner and a show , or you can just go to dinner			1
gourmands the land over have noticed that the @entity59 ( please , never call it " @entity2 " ) is quietly becoming a destination for high - quality dining , with everything from schmancy white - tablecloth affairs to traditional soul - food and meat - and - three spots drawing crowds			1
@entity67 , the latest by " top chef " alum and @entity2 native @entity69 , was recently named one of @entity72 's best new restaurants and marries @entity74 churrascari and @entity76 dim sum - style dining with @entity69 's love of all things meat			1
celebrity chef @entity79 has @entity80 and @entity81			1
@entity82 is one of @entity85 's four restaurants in @entity13 ; it serves three meals a day that focus heavily on local ingredients			2
perhaps tickling the most taste buds lately is chef @entity89 , whose seven spots range from seafood ( @entity91 ) to @entity92 - inspired ( no. 246 ) as well as stretching from @entity2 's re-emerging @entity93 to its commuter - heavy northern suburbs			1
and all of that 's not even to mention @entity98 's ridiculously rich array of traditional @entity100 cuisine ; tradition - rich @entity101 ; no - frills @entity102 , home of the massive @entity105 ; and @entity106 , the carny sideshow - themed bastion of guilty pleasures evolved from a corn dog cart by @entity111 , host of the @entity113 's " @entity112			1
" @entity114 it 's been decades since the @entity116 made the short drive up from @entity118 to conquer @entity2 with tunes like " @entity120 " and " @entity121			1
" ( again ... please do n't call it that			0
) now , it 's all about the @entity124			0
the @entity126 has called @entity2 " hip - hop 's center of gravity , " and aside from @entity127 and @entity128 , it 's hard to argue for another city being as influential in the form 's evolution			1
a recent three - day stand by native sons @entity136 in @entity2 's @entity137 turned into a joyous homecoming weekend of sorts , bringing together everyone from hip young urbanites to suburban soccer moms to shake it like a @entity145 picture to a group that 's helped define hip - hop since emerging from @entity2 's neighbor @entity148 in 1992			1
@entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 are just a few of the other artists who call @entity2 home , where a new generation of mcs and djs are bubbling up at venues like @entity161 , @entity152 's @entity162 and @entity163			1
the presence of @entity154 , and his @entity166 record label , has even been responsible for drawing @entity167 to the city			2
but do n't hold that against us			0
if hip - hop is n't your thing , @entity2 has a thriving underground rock scene , spawning such current acts as sludge rockers @entity176 , power - pop stars - in - waiting the biters and indie darlings @entity181			1
and @entity182 is one of the most highly regarded acoustic music venues in the @entity185			0
performers from across the country are on the months - long waiting list for the club 's highly regarded open - mic showcase , which has helped launch artists like @entity192 , @entity193 , the @entity194 and @entity195			0
a city of small towns unlike a lot of cities , @entity2 does n't have a central entertainment and shopping district			1
you know ... unless you love the @entity204 and @entity24			0
if you 're looking for a taste of @entity2 only downtown , you 'll be disappointed			1
instead , hit neighborhoods like @entity207 , packed with record stores , live music and theater venues , restaurants , vintage clothing shops and the like ( not to mention a burger joint with a giant psychedelic skull for an entrance )			0
or similarly funky @entity216 , where the @entity217 serves indie rock and brunch with equal skill and residents are so cool , they have their own web radio station			0
for a slightly quieter good time , hit the square in downtown @entity225 , which bumps up to @entity2 's eastern city limit and , in addition to being home to the aforementioned @entity182 , features enough great restaurants that foodies have visited just to nosh at the spots packed within about a half - mile of each other			1
if you want to enjoy the real @entity2 , skip @entity24 , catch a cab and enjoy some of what the city really has to offer			1
the story of civil rights the @entity37 teems with civil rights history , and different cities often focus on their slivers of the story			0
@entity2 has made a play to introduce the broad history to new generations by connecting the movement of the 1960s to the human rights issues of today			1
the @entity255 opened this year , offering comprehensive and sometimes intense views of the movement 's darkest moments and greatest achievements			0
another side of the museum presents an evolving look at modern human rights issues around the world			0
just a few miles down the road , visitors can examine the lives of the movement 's greatest leader , @entity270 of @entity273 's birth home on @entity236 are free , and tickets are often snapped up early in the day			0
even visitors who do n't score a trip through the stately yellow home can spend hours wandering the @entity273 @entity279 run by the @entity280 , peeking into historic @entity281 or visiting the @entity281 -- the resting place of @entity273 and his wife , @entity284			0
@entity286 's ' @entity285 ' : the @entity37 's most inspired garden beyond the big attractions when in @entity2 , you 're basically obligated to cross the sugar - sticky floors of the @entity15 tasting room , to gawk at @entity294 's " @entity293 " - era parlor and drop in on the latest big - name exhibition at the @entity297 but you 'll be missing out if you stop at the typical tourist draws			1
to get a deeper view of the city 's history and personality , check out some of the smaller attractions not far from downtown			1
there 's the @entity307 , where you can catch a puppet show geared toward kids or adults , or just get a close - up look at beloved puppets from @entity313			0
yes , your favorites are there , from the @entity317 chef to the @entity318 to @entity319 herself			2
@entity320 and young can enjoy storytime at the @entity322 , the meticulously restored @entity238 home of famed @entity2 writer @entity323 , who wrote the beloved and controversial @entity325 tales			2
and just west of downtown , the @entity327 offers fantastically curated exhibitions that focus on art by and about women of the @entity333 diaspora			0
for a glimpse of these and other out - of - the - way spots , as showcased by locals , take a look for the # @entity339 hashtag , started by a couple of photographers who did n't think the city was showing out on social media like it should , on @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity347			1
ditch the car -- no , really what if you could visit @entity2 and somehow excuse yourself from all the tired jokes about terrible traffic ? ( @entity353 : your time is worthless ! @entity355 ? ) believe it ; it can be done			2
there are more attractions and restaurants popping up along the city 's @entity361 train lines			0
a single ride costs $ 2.50 , far less than a cab or rental car			0
a new streetcar will soon be running in a 2.7 - mile east - west loop from the hotel - heavy downtown			2
it 'll take visitors past a gaggle of quirky pop - up shops to the burgeoning bar scene along @entity375 and near the martin luther king jr. national historic site			0
visitors can also hit the @entity378 , a car - free stretch where residents run , ride , scoot and stroll , sometimes stopping for a drink at a restaurant along the way or dropping by @entity386 , the city 's busy central greenspace			2
more beltline trails are in the works , which will only make it easier to navigate between neighborhoods with just a pair of comfortable shoes			0
' @entity395 ' in @entity13 : film tourism comes to life			0

look beyond downtown @entity2 for the secrets of this *vibrant* @entity50 city
dining is a standout pastime with celebrity - chef driven spots and no - frills local favorites
@entity2 has played a huge role in the evolution of hip - hop
