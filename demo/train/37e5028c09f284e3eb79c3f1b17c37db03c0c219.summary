@entity1 , @entity0 -- sahab and her family were not willing refugees			2
like many in @entity8 , they were forced to leave their family home and move several times to different locations to avoid the worsening security situation all around them			1
the final straw came when they hid for more than three hours , taking shelter under some stairs , as @entity20 planes attacked the town @entity22 , in @entity24 province			0
when it was safe to move , @entity25 joined around 50 other people heading towards the border in a van that normally transports animals			0
from there , it was another five hour journey by foot , at night , in the freezing cold			0
the small bags of belongings they 'd brought with them were mostly thrown away along the route as the going got harder ; children lost their shoes as they stumbled in the dark and made the last part of their journey walking in just their socks or barefoot			0
" we were just seeking a safe place to stay where no - one would attack us " , said 42 year - old @entity25 , who i met with her family at the main reception centre in @entity0 's @entity48			0
more than 130,000 people are officially registered at @entity48 , which is struggling to cope with the flood of refugees			1

now we are here , we feel safer			0
but we 'd like to be able to return to @entity8 as quickly as possible and for the fighting to end , " @entity25 told me			1
" i want a decent , secure life , to have a life with dignity			0
" but aid agencies like mine are struggling to respond to the needs of people like @entity63 and to provide them with basic services			1
@entity66 is a sprawling camp made up of canvas tents and prefab shelters in the @entity0 desert , close to the @entity8 border , which has tripled in size in the last three months , in order to accommodate the thousands of refugees arriving every day			1
the @entity0 government wants to open at least two new camps to ease the congestion , but there 's no funding			0
hundreds of thousands of other refugees in @entity0 , @entity81 and other countries bordering @entity8 , such as @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 , are living in host communities , often in unheated , unfurnished buildings or makeshift shelters , where it is even harder for them to get the help they need			1

but so far , most of the funds have failed to materialize			0
the @entity97 says it has received just 20 % of the money promised so far			0
that means some very difficult decisions will soon have to be made on the ground			1
the @entity97 children 's agency , @entity106 , which funds @entity109 's emergency work in @entity48 , where the agency is installing latrines , showers and washing areas , says it has only received 9 % of the funds it needs for its work in @entity0			1
@entity106 has warned that without more money , it will have to scale back , even on life - saving interventions , including water , sanitation , hygiene work and child protection			2

there are now one million registered refugees , though the true number is far higher , since many fleeing @entity8 choose not to register			1
an end to the conflict is nowhere in sight , meaning that the flood of refugees leaving the country is likely to continue			2
host countries , including @entity81 and @entity0 , must be commended for keeping their borders open and providing help			2
but the refugee numbers -- which currently account for 8 % of @entity81 's total population and around 5 % of the @entity0 population , are now straining limited resources			0
tensions are starting to appear between local host populations , who until now have been extremely generous , and the new refugees , as there 's greater competition for affordable housing , health and school facilities			1
even if peace could be secured , that does n't address the longer - term issue : funding will be needed to help families rebuild their shattered lives , for months and years to come			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

the number of refugees fleeing @entity8 's civil war has reached one million
aid agencies including @entity109 are struggling to cope with the flood of new arrivals
@entity160 : without more money to help , difficult decisions will have to be made
" tensions are starting to appear between local host populations *...* and new refugees "
