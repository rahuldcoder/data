@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents in @entity1 's @entity4 packed up treasured possessions and scrambled to build makeshift levees monday as federal authorities diverted more water their way from the swollen @entity10			1
" we just moved in here , and now we 're in the process of moving everything out , " said @entity11 , of the town of @entity13			1
but he added , " i have no choice			0
if not , i 'm going to lose everything			0
" @entity13 , with a population of about 1,300 , is now in the path of hundreds of thousands of gallons of water now entering the @entity4 basin every second since the weekend opening of the @entity10 's @entity25			1
the controlled release succeeded in dropping projected flood levels for @entity28 and @entity29 -- but that was little consolation to those living along the @entity4 , which parallels the @entity10 through southern @entity1			1
" hope you appreciate this @entity29			1
you 're welcome , " read one sign posted outside a home in the path of the flooding			2
signs of resilience in flooded lowlands in @entity13 , about 20 miles from the spillway , mayor @entity42 told @entity2 that workers are scrambling to put together a temporary levee to protect about 240 homes on the south side of town			1
" they 're not happy with it , but it 's something that we 've been knowing for quite some time -- that it was inevitable , that it would have to be opened , " @entity42 said			2
" they 've come to deal with it			0
" and in @entity59 , about 20 miles further south , @entity58 president @entity57 said about three - quarters of his constituents ' homes are expected to suffer water damage after the @entity63 opened the spillway on saturday			2
" it 's a slow , painful rise , but it is rising just a little bit every night , " @entity57 told @entity2			0
the diversion will drain water from the @entity10 through the @entity4 to the @entity69 at @entity0			1
@entity1 gov. @entity70 offered at least a ray of hope to his state 's residents on monday , saying the decision to open the spillway has lowered crest projections in parts of the state			1
scared evacuees flee homes just as important , river observations now suggest the @entity63 may need to divert less water from the spillway than initially thought , he said			2
but based on historical estimates , damages to agriculture alone in @entity1 could total $ 300 million , @entity70 said			1
the @entity63 opened two gates in the @entity25 on saturday , the first release from the facility since 1973			1
by monday night , 15 of the structure 's 125 bays had been opened , divertnig about 102,000 cubic feet ( 763,000 gallons ) of water per second , @entity63 spokeswoman @entity93 told @entity2			1
the plan is eventually to open about a quarter of the spillway , according to the agency			2
in @entity0 , the rising @entity98 was already lapping at a downtown riverwalk monday evening			0
@entity100 , a @entity63 spokesman , told @entity2 's " @entity105 " that 20,000 to 25,000 homes could be flooded , but the agency and @entity1 authorities are working to limit the damage			1
" the system is under tremendous pressure , and it will be for a long time , so our key concern is making sure that we 're vigilant , " @entity100 said			2
" we 're out there on the system , making sure the system stays intact while we 're still working with the communities to try to help with the flooding			0
" your guide to flooding terms officials say the spillway 's gates are likely to be open for weeks , and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage and those who have evacuated can safely return			1
the flood is the most significant to hit the lower @entity10 valley since at least 1937 and has so far affected nine states : @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity1 and @entity10			1
across the @entity136 and lower @entity137 , floodwaters have already covered about 3 million acres of farmland , eroding for many farmers what could have been a profitable year for corn , wheat , rice and cotton , officials said			0
as many as 22 cities and communities where river levels are monitored by the @entity149 government remain flooded , some of them weeks after both the @entity10 and @entity131 rivers climbed out of their banks			0
a near - record crest on the @entity10 is forecast in @entity155 , @entity10 , early tuesday , followed through the weekend by record crests in @entity157 and @entity158 , @entity10 ; @entity159 , @entity1 , and @entity29 , according to the @entity160			1
in @entity155 , more than 200 miles north of the spillway , the river was just short of its projected crest of 64.3 feet at noon monday , according to the @entity160			0
that was more than 16 feet over flood stage and less than a foot below the peak of the historic flood of 1927			0
in @entity158 , the river is expected to rise five feet above the 1927 record of 58 feet , weather service forecasts show			0
the predicted crest is 15 feet above flood stage , and the @entity173 has closed the river to navigation along a 15 - mile stretch near the city , @entity177			0
high water has already chased members of the @entity173 stationed in @entity158 from their offices , chief boatswain 's mate @entity179 said			0
the 16 people stationed there are currently working aboard the @entity185 , @entity179 said			0
the weather service predicted the @entity10 will crest at 45 feet in @entity29 , the @entity1 capital , on tuesday			1
that is 2.5 feet lower and six days earlier than the weather service had forecast prior to the opening of the @entity25			1
on monday , it was 44.6 feet			0
in @entity28 , the river on monday was already cresting at 17 feet , one week earlier and more than two feet lower than previously projected by the @entity160			2
it is also four feet lower than the historic level recorded in @entity28 in 1922			2
but six days after the @entity10 crested at @entity194 , the water remains 11 feet above flood stage , according to the @entity160			0
president @entity197 spent about 35 minutes privately speaking with flood victims and responders during a visit to @entity194 on monday , according to press secretary @entity201			0
@entity2 's @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
