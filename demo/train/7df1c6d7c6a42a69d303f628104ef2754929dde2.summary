-- there is a phrase that has long been used in certain big - city political circles			0
it has always been said with an implied -- and sometimes literal -- sneer : " they think it 's on the legit			1
" it refers to people who are trusting by nature -- occasionally novice political adversaries , often the general public -- and who make the mistake of actually believing a proposal that is being presented to them			0
people who , hearing a promise , take it on faith			2
" they think it 's on the legit			2
" meaning : " suckers			0
" this is @entity26 week			2
for all the heated talk about , and blame - placing over , the deeply troubled federal health care initiative -- for those who blame president @entity28 and the @entity29 for the screwed - up rollout , for those who blame the @entity32 for their longstanding opposition to the @entity35 plan and their determination to combat it at every turn , for those who are furious that the early pledge about being able to keep current insurance was not real , for those who take delight that the website has been a disaster because it makes one side come off as incompetent -- this may be a good moment to step back and think , with real - life compassion , about what sometimes gets lost in the partisan back - and - forth			1
to think about the people who do n't care much about @entity54 haggling , but who desperately need dependable health care for their families , and who were hoping against hope that readily available medical care was at last going to be theirs			1
the people who heard the promises			0
they thought it was on the legit			2
at base , this is n't -- or should not be -- a matter of politics , of @entity70 winners and losers			2
the families to whom reliable health care has been an unattainable dream do n't care which party finds a way to that health care for them			1
and both parties , at least in their public statements , agree that while they might not concur at all on the method of getting there , they concur on the goal			0
sen. @entity84 , @entity85 : " as policymakers , we must focus on making health care more affordable and accessible for all @entity89			1
" let the ideologues on both ends of the right - left continuum make a game of this , if they wish			0
but do you think , when a person with a sick child finds a doctor who will help and who will bring peace of mind , the parent cares whether the physician is a @entity32 or a @entity105 ? the same goes for how a person in such need would feel about a member of @entity109 who helped him or her find a path to decent care			0
for those among us fortunate enough to have doctors we can go to , and the means to pay for them , this @entity26 week is a time to remind ourselves how grateful we should feel to be in such a position			2
because it is only when you 're not in that position -- when you are sick and have nowhere to turn , or , worse , when it is your son or daughter who is sick and you have to explain that you have nowhere to turn -- that you fully understand the fear and helplessness that kicks in in the middle of the night			0
come october 1 , the people who yearned for a way to take care of their families ' health were told , such a way will be yours			1
well - to - do people are always going to have more options for finding the best health care for their families			1
that is a fact of life			0
but -- and here is where political leaders of both parties , whatever their differences , should find common ground -- access to health care should n't be a luxury			1
health care is not a @entity149 , or a mansion on a hill			1
a family should not be deprived of it merely because they lack wealth , or have lost employment			0
republicans and @entity29 , @entity89 all , should acknowledge that health care is not a diamond bracelet to be gazed at with longing through a store window			1
it 's time to cool down the rhetoric and the finger - pointing			0
before we get any deeper into the recriminations about rollouts and delays and extensions and penalties and startovers and repeals , we might want to pause , this @entity26 week , to put ourselves in the shoes of the people to whom the promise was profound and real			1
there but for the grace			0
. the people who need health care and who wait for this mess to be cleaned up are the people who have always been asked to wait			1
they will wait again , because they have little choice			0
for the rest of us , perhaps this is a week not only for prayers of thanksgiving for what we have , but also a week for thoughts of those families who believed it when they were told that things were going to change for the better			1
who thought it was on the legit			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197			0

@entity197 : in politics , to take something on faith is to believe it is " on the legit "
it 's another way of saying : suckers . people thought health reform was on the legit , he says
he says at @entity26 , politicians should recall who gets left out in health care *bickering*
@entity197 : it 's the people who ca n't afford health care , but believed things would change for better
