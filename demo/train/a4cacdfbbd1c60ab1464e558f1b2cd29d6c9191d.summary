@entity0 -- the political furor escalated over president @entity4 's high - profile rebuke of a recent @entity6 ruling on campaign advertising thursday , as @entity8 pounded the high court decision			1
democrats rallied around @entity4 the day after the president committed a rare breach of political etiquette , criticizing the controversial ruling in his @entity15 as members of the high court sat only a few feet away			1
that triggered something equally unusual			0
justice @entity20 , a conservative backer of the ruling , frowned and appeared to mouth the words " not true			1
" @entity20 's apparent reply was a rare flash of emotion among @entity6 justices who typically sit stony faced and refrain from even clapping during @entity15 speeches			1
the actions of both men may be unprecedented , according to one longtime court observer			0
the court 's 5 - 4 decision in @entity35 , issued last week , removed long - established legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums of money to influence voters in political campaigns			1
@entity8 fear the decision has given the traditionally pro-business @entity44 a powerful new advantage			2
" with all due deference to separation of powers , last week the @entity6 reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections , " @entity4 told a packed @entity47 chamber wednesday night			2
" i do n't think @entity59 elections should be bankrolled by @entity59 's most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities			0
they should be decided by the @entity59 people			0
and i 'd urge @entity8 and @entity44 to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems			2
" @entity20 , part of the court 's conservative majority , could be seen apparently frowning and quietly mouthing the words " not true			1
" @entity6 justices rarely express any hint of emotion or opinion during the president 's @entity15 speech			1
on the @entity79 floor thursday morning , sen. @entity76 , @entity77 , said the ruling " goes to the very core of our democracy and it will allow major corporations -- who should have law written to control their effect on @entity59 -- instead control @entity59			1
that is not the @entity59 i grew up in			0
" @entity76 , the chairman of the @entity90 , ripped @entity20 for what he claimed was hypocrisy in preaching the virtues of judicial restraint while backing a decision overturning decades of legal precedent			1
" in his confirmation hearing , @entity20 ... testified that the role of the @entity6 is a limited role , " @entity76 said			1
" that was then when he was seeking confirmation			0
" a spokesman for the high court had no comment when reached by @entity1			0
read the @entity6 ruling in @entity35 v. @entity106 vice president @entity107 , appearing thursday on @entity109 's " @entity108 , " argued @entity4 " did n't question the integrity of the court			1
he questioned the judgment of it			0
" @entity107 called the decision " outrageous " and said " we have to correct it			0
" most republicans have defended the ruling , calling it a long overdue recognition of first amendment rights			0
former @entity106 chairman @entity121 , who supports the ruling , called @entity4 's remarks the act of " a fairly desperate president who 's trying to remake himself			1
" in the process , @entity121 claimed , @entity4 is " willing to essentially say things that are not true			2
" sen. @entity128 , @entity129 , told reporters he thought " calling out the @entity6 when they 're sitting right there trying to impassively listen ... was a little over the top			0
" @entity133 , a writer for the web site @entity135 who has covered the @entity6 for five decades , told @entity1 he could not recall ever seeing a president rebuke the high court in such a high - profile forum			0
but @entity20 's apparent reaction , he argued , was " quite inappropriate			2
" @entity4 " was talking about the consequences of the opinion , " @entity133 said			2
once the justices issue a decision , " they really need to let the political branches or the people deal with it as they will			0
" @entity149 : @entity20 's reaction was fair @entity133 noted that justice @entity151 , the longest - serving current member of the high court , never attends @entity15 addresses			1
attending such a speech , @entity133 said , involves the justices in a " political circus " that can damage a justice 's image of impartiality			2
@entity1 's @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
