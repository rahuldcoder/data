-- it was a mother 's worst nightmare			1
on march 31 , 2014 , at 11 p.m. , i received a phone call from my 25 - year - old son			1
i got lost , made a wrong turn and ended up at the @entity9 border			1
i 've been surrounded by military , and i need you to know in case anything happens to me			2
" on april 1 , i received another phone call			2
" @entity6 , i 've been arrested			2
please get me an attorney , " @entity15 said			0
it was the most frightening call of my life -- worse than the call from @entity20 as my son explained , " we have just been hit by an ied			1
" the call from @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity9 , three days later went this way : " @entity6 , i am not going to make it through the night			1
whatever you do , do not come down here and ask questions or do an investigation as you will be killed as well			0
" as @entity34 comes and goes this year , it is bittersweet to think about my son being bound by a felony arrest in a foreign country while we try to navigate a foreign judicial system			2
to think about my son , vibrant and ambitious , being held in the bondage of incarceration is inconceivable			1
this young man who valiantly fought for the freedom of others , willing to die to combat the evil of oppression and violence in two tours in @entity20 , meritoriously promoted to sergeant on the battlefield in 2012 -- and now he is languishing in a @entity9 penitentiary and experiencing captivity for the first time , as a result of one wrong turn			1
he has been incarcerated since april 1 , for inadvertently crossing the border with legally purchased firearms			2
this separation is by far more traumatic than the combat tours			1
@entity62 ' optimistic ' he 'll soon be released in @entity20 , he had his @entity62 brothers who always had his back			1
i feel like our executive branch has abandoned him , and it feels totally inhumane			0
the @entity68 has not responded to us despite our petition on @entity70 , which has nearly 130,000 signatures			0
the @entity68 says it will respond to petitions that get 100,000 signatures in 30 days			0
on a trip to @entity9 in may , secretary of state @entity76 " raised the issue " with authorities there			1
@entity15 's situation should be considered a grave , serious and urgent concern			0
in the past years while reading scripture , i often paused at the directive to visit those in prison			0
deep in my core was the question , mingled with fear : how , who , why ? today i have learned to walk without shame , boldly and compassionately , through the corridors of bars and locks and have a newfound perspective for those imprisoned			2
incarceration of a loved one is a heart - wrenching , soul - searching experience that can debilitate , consume and potentially destroy both the captive and his free loved ones			0
@entity62 tells of abuse in @entity9 prison it is a difficult journey , but there is rest to be found in understanding that @entity108 's timing is perfect			1
i take huge comfort in that , and this is what keeps me going and fortifies my strength and helps me to persevere when i ca n't see @entity108 's plan			0
the saying , " trust his heart when you ca n't trace his hand " is something i really have had to implement			0
through faith , i will continue choosing not to be crippled by the weight of the dismay , trauma , and disbelief associated with this , and i will be steadfast in my determination to overcome the barriers of this injustice			2
my strength , focus and vision come both from the @entity132 and from the solidarity and outreach of so many good folks on both sides of the border and around the world			0
i am not journeying alone as i have poured out my broken heart to so many			0
and it feels as if they symbolically cupped my tears and replenish me continuously with flowing waters of hope and support			0
i fear that my son 's plight is getting lost in current events happening on the ground in @entity9 , but i know that through the collective strength of prayer and the unified focus of individual @entity154 standing together as advocates , there will be victory for @entity15 .			1

mother of @entity62 being held in @entity9 says this separation is worse than his combat tours
@entity163 says her son expressed fear he would not make it
he was arrested after crossing into @entity9 with several guns in his car
@entity163 is relying on her faith to get her through this
