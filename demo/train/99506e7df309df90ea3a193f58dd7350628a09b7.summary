@entity0 , @entity1 -- one by one , with a hand as steady as a surgeon 's , @entity4 removes eggs from a sea turtle 's nest on a @entity1 beach			1
" if it falls , you probably killed the hatchling that 's developing inside , " said @entity10 , a biologist with the @entity11			0
@entity10 admits she holds her breath each time she takes an egg out of the sand and places it in the foam cooler			0
sand is delicately placed in the cooler between and on top of each egg			0
@entity10 uses the sand from the nest , which is located just a few inches from the beach 's surface			0
this process is part of an unprecedented sea turtle relocation program			1
moving sea turtle nests days before the eggs are to hatch has never been done before			1
it is also the first time that wildlife experts had to deal with oil gushing into the @entity37			1
" shy of letting the hatchlings swim in oil , it 's our best alternative , " said @entity38 , the national sea turtle coordinator for the @entity11			1
" we 're confident if they go into oil they 're going to die			2
" @entity10 is working on the second sea turtle nest to be moved since the program started			1
ninety percent of the @entity51 ' sea turtle population can be found on @entity1 's beaches , according to the @entity11			1
it is estimated that 700 nests can be found in the @entity55 , an area vulnerable to the oil spill			2
" this is a huge relocation effort , " said @entity57 , assistant secretary of interior for fish and wildlife and parks			1
" as many as 50 to 100,000 eggs over the next six to eight weeks will be dug up			0
" an average nest has anywhere from 100 to 120 eggs			0
sea turtles come out of the water a few feet from the coastline and lay their eggs in the warm sand			2
loggerhead turtle eggs , the type @entity10 is handling , usually hatch within 60 to 70 days			1
the eggs are moved just over a week before they are expected to hatch			0
wildlife officials want to keep the eggs in their natural environment as long as possible			2
" through the eggs it 's believed they actually connect to the landscapes where they were born , " @entity57 said			0
once the turtles mature it is hoped that they will return to the original nesting area and the natural birthing cycle will continue			0
once @entity10 's two coolers are full , with the nest 's 107 eggs , they will start a journey across the state			0
a special climate - controlled truck donated by @entity93 will deliver the eggs to the @entity95 in @entity1			2
the coolers will be stored in a special @entity98 building that will be regulated to the warm summer temperatures to which the eggs are accustomed			1
instead of the beautiful white sandy beach , the hatchlings will be born in the transport coolers			0
once they break out of their shells , the warm blue @entity104 will be awaiting them .			2

@entity51 wildlife experts are moving sea turtle eggs by hand to save them from the oil *disaster*
such a relocation effort has never been done before
they are being taken from @entity55 to @entity95
they will be stored in a special @entity98 building , then released into the @entity104
