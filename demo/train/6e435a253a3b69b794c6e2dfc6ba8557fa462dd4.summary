-- @entity1 have absolved driver @entity2 from any blame after he crashed out of the @entity4 , saying the collision was caused by car failure			1
the @entity7 , who suffered serious head injuries in an incident at the @entity11 , crashed twice in two days at @entity13 's demanding street circuit			1
when @entity2 collided with the barriers at the first corner during final practice on saturday , @entity1 blamed the accident on driver error			1
the damage to the car was so significant that @entity2 had to sit out qualifying because the @entity1 mechanics could not mend his scarlet racer in time			1
during sunday 's race , @entity2 had worked his way up from the back of the grid when he was taken out by a spookily similar accident at the same @entity30 corner			1
" after an initial evaluation carried out on based on telemetry data , the engineers looked at all the components of @entity2 's car , especially those that sustained damage in the heavy impact when the car crashed on lap 29 of the race , " explained @entity1 after carrying out an nvestigation at their @entity33 headquarters			1
" the findings validated the first impressions of the engineers , confirming that the accident was caused by an element of the front left suspension breaking			2
" @entity2 was attended to by medical staff on the side of the circuit before being taken for a full check - up			2
" i was taken to hospital for all the precautionary checks and luckily everything is in order , " said @entity2			2
" i 'm all right , i 've just got a slight pain in my neck , but nothing serious			2
now i will look to get in shape and be back 100 % for the @entity62 race , " added the @entity7 , referring to the @entity64 gp			1
" all i want to do is put this bad weekend behind me and think about doing well in the rest of the season			0
" @entity2 sat out the second half of the 2009 @entity69 season after he fractured his skull and was put into an induced coma following a freak accident during qualifying for the @entity74 @entity4			1
he was hit on the helmet by a spring that had fallen off @entity78 's @entity63 car and plunged at high - speed into the barriers			0
any subsequent incident involving @entity2 has an extra poignancy following the 2009 trauma , which sent shockwaves through the close - knit @entity1 paddock			1
" the best news to come out of the @entity4 weekend is that @entity2 is fine , " said @entity1 team boss @entity86			1
" two big accidents , just over 24 hours apart and all he has to show for it is a bit of muscle pain			0
fortunately there were no other injuries			0
" @entity1 's championship contender @entity94 , who won the previous race in @entity97 , had a subdued weekend in @entity4 , finishing seventh after a difficult race in the principality			1
the @entity100 retained third place in the drivers ' championship but he has now fallen 29 points behind @entity106 's leader @entity105 and is eight points adrift of @entity109 driver @entity108 after six events in the 19 - race season			0
the season resumes in @entity64 next month and @entity86 said the team were steeling themselves for a season of ups and downs			2
" this championship seems to be a real rollercoaster of emotions , " commented @entity86			0
" following on from a good weekend comes a bad one			0
" from now on , it will be important to establish a consistent level of performance			0
the championship standings are very close and the number of strong opponents is ever increasing			0
" it 's a scenario in which each point is precious and each hundredth of performance becomes important and obviously we are well aware that one less reliability problem can be very significant in terms of how the championship pans out			0
" we have a lot of work to do in the coming days to be as well prepared as possible for @entity62			0
" meanwhile former @entity137 and @entity138 driver @entity136 got behind the wheel of a @entity1 car for the first time on monday			2
the @entity143 driver , who lost his @entity138 seat at the end of 2012 , is now part of the " @entity1 family " and will drive the 2010 @entity69 car at a demonstration event in @entity150 , as well as racing in the @entity151 for the @entity153 marque .			0
