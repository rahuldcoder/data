@entity0 , @entity1 -- residents of @entity1 know their work is cut out for them as they struggle for normalcy after enduring the wrath of @entity7			1
the landlocked rural state saw fast - moving floods spawned by the storm swarm towns from @entity11 to @entity12			1
" it 's heartbreaking to see your home and home state destroyed -- and seeing places and landmarks that you can recognize even from early childhood now destroyed by flooding , " said @entity13 who lives in @entity14 near the state 's border with @entity17			1
there was no way in or out of his town , the 20 - year - old @entity27 said			2
the story was much the same in the southern town of @entity34			2
cut off on several sides , the @entity35 had to travel through neighboring @entity37 to get rescue crews to the small , cut - off community			1
" @entity7 hit us hard			0
a lot of businesses were destroyed			0
loss of property -- roads , bridges , homes washed away , " said @entity43			0
" it is going to take a long time to rebuild			0
" on tuesday , @entity51 administrator @entity50 planned to tour flooded communities in the state			1
a day earlier , president @entity54 signed a disaster declaration , allowing federal aid to the state			1
" it 's just devastating , " gov. @entity57 said monday			0
" @entity60 communities under water , businesses , homes , obviously roads and bridges , rail transportation infrastructure , " he said			1
" we 're tough folks up here but @entity7 ... really hit us hard			0
" three deaths had been confirmed as a result of the storm			1
hundreds of people remained trapped in communities cut off by raging floodwaters that washed out or otherwise damaged 263 roads and bridges , @entity57 said			1
exactly how many were stranded remained unclear , he said , because it 's difficult to get into many communities			1
the governor described conditions as " probably the toughest flooding that we 've seen in the state of @entity1 in our history			1
" normally tranquil streams poured through city streets and thrashed against buildings and bridges , including some of the state 's iconic covered bridges			2
four to six of the covered bridges were destroyed in the flooding , officials said			2
even the state emergency management headquarters in @entity95 was flooded , forcing officials to evacuate to @entity0 , about 20 miles away			1
many areas of the state remained under flood watches and warnings early tuesday , with the @entity101 reporting continued record flooding in some locations			1
unlike many states , @entity1 did not order or suggest evacuations			0
many of the state 's towns are in lowlands and there are few large areas of dry land , so large - scale evacuations are impractical , @entity57 said			2
@entity114 , a @entity17 , knew the threat @entity7 posed for his home state			2
but he did n't think he 'd feel its effects in @entity1 where his friends and family had arrived over the weekend for his wedding			0
" my friends were telling me , ' this is awesome ! you got us out of @entity17 for the weekend , " @entity114 said			0
now , they are stranded in @entity127 in central @entity1 , with no roads to get them out			0
" we are making the best of things , " he said			0
but he is also keeping an eye on the calendar and his fingers crossed			0
he is really looking forward to his honeymoon thursday			0
