more than 100,000 people are eager to make themselves at home on another planet			0
they 've applied for a one - way trip to @entity4 , hoping to be chosen to spend the rest of their lives on uncharted territory , according to an organization planning the manned missions			1
the @entity12 project wants to colonize the red planet , beginning in 2022			1
there are financial and practical questions about this venture that have n't been clarified			0
will there be enough money ? will people really be able to survive on @entity4 ? but these have n't stopped some 30,000 @entity20 from signing up			1
you can see some of the candidates on the project 's website , but they 're not the only ones who have applied , said @entity27 , @entity12 ceo and co-founder			1
" there is also a very large number of people who are still working on their profile , so either they have decided not to pay the application fee , or they are still making their video or they 're still filling out the questionnaire or their resume			0
so the people that you can see online are only the ones that have finished and who have set their profiles as public , " @entity27 said			0
the entrepreneur did not specify how many have paid the fees , completed their profiles and configured them as private			0
the application process anyone 18 or older may apply , but the fee depends on a user 's nationality			1
for @entity20 , it 's $ 38 ; if you 're in @entity53 , however , it 's a mere $ 15			2
the company said it sets the price based on the gross domestic product per capita of each nation			0
" we wanted it to be high enough for people to have to really think about it and low enough for anyone to be able to afford it , " @entity27 said			0
for the first crew , the @entity12 mission will cost $ 6 billion , @entity27 said			1
the idea is for it to be funded by sponsors and media that will pay for broadcasting rights of shows and movies documenting everything from the astronauts ' training on @entity76 to their deployment and colonization of @entity4			1
out of the applicants , @entity12 said it will select a multicontinental group of 40 astronauts this year			1
four of them -- two men and two women -- are set to leave for @entity4 in september 2022 , landing in april 2023			1
a one - way ticket to @entity4 -- apply now another multicontinental group of four will be deployed two years later , according to the @entity12 plan			1
none of them will return to @entity76			0
the astronauts will undergo a required eight - year training in a secluded location			1
according to the project site , they will learn how to repair habitat structures , grow vegetables in confined spaces and address " both routine and serious medical issues such as dental upkeep , muscle tears and bone fractures			0
" " what we want to do is tell the story to the world , " @entity27 said , " when humans go to @entity4 , when they settle on @entity4 and build a new @entity76 , a new planet			1
this is one of the most exciting things that ever happened , and we want to share the story with the entire world			0
" how will @entity4 be colonized ? each lander that @entity12 sends will be able to carry about 5,511 pounds of " useful load " to @entity4 , he said			1
after eight missions , more than 44,000 pounds of supplies and people are expected to have arrived			0
the capsules themselves , whose weight is not included in that number , will become part of the habitat			0
food and solar panels will go in the capsules			0
@entity76 wo n't be sending much water or oxygen though -- those will be manufactured on @entity4 , @entity27 said			1
astronauts will filter @entity4 water from the @entity4 soil			1
" we will evaporate it and condense it back into its liquid state , " he said			0
" from the water we can make hydrogen and oxygen , and we will use the oxygen for a breathing atmosphere inside the habitat			0
this will be prepared by the rovers autonomously before the humans arrive			0
" it sounds like terraforming , a process in which the conditions of a planet are modified to make it habitable , but @entity27 said it is n't			0
" we will create an atmosphere that looks like the atmosphere on @entity76 , so you could say that we are terraforming the habitat			0
but to terraform the entire planet , that 's a project that will take hundreds and hundreds of years , " he added			0
a dangerous mission in spite of the risks of space travel , the @entity12 founder said he is convinced of the viability of the project			1
however , some space travel experts have said the risks are far too high to carry out these manned missions to @entity4 , a distance that humans have never traveled			1
radiation is a big concern			2
@entity172 does not allow their astronauts to expose themselves to radiation levels that could increase their risk of developing cancer by more than 3 %			1
to maintain the radiation exposure standards that @entity172 requires , the maximum time an astronaut can spend in space " is anywhere from about 300 days to about 360 days for the solar minimum activity			1
for solar maximum , in ranges anywhere from about 275 days to 500 days , " said @entity183 , @entity172 spaceflight radiation officer			2
a round - trip journey to @entity4 could expose astronauts to the maximum amount of radiation allowed in a career under current @entity172 standards , according to a recent study by scientists at the space agency			1
@entity12 is planning a one - way journey , which does n't negate the problem , and being on @entity4 could expose astronauts to even more radiation , depending on how long they stay and what the shielding conditions are like			1
radiation damages cells ' dna , which can lead to cell death or permanent changes that may result in cancer			2
however , " there 's no convincing human evidence for excess abnormalities in offspring of radiation - exposed adults , " @entity183 said			1
while orbiting the @entity76 , astronauts get exposed to greater concentrations of cosmic background radiation than here on @entity76 in addition to charged particles trapped in the upper atmosphere and from the sun , said @entity220 , epidemiologist at the @entity221			2
as a spacecraft moves into deep space , the people on board would be exposed to even more cosmic radiation and solar particles , which is " fairly dangerous , " @entity220 said			2
interestingly , according to @entity220 , astronauts ' risk of dying of cancer is lower than that of the general public because they tend to be in shape , eat well , do n't smoke and receive careful monitoring from doctors			0
of course , none of them have been to @entity4			2
@entity183 emphasized that @entity172 does not study the health effects of @entity4 colonization and that it 's focusing on shorter recognition missions of the surface of @entity4			2
" we 're not looking at colonization of @entity4 or anything			2
we 're not focusing our research on those kinds of questions			0
" can it be done ? @entity12 is n't the only group hoping to make history by sending people to the red planet			2
the @entity253 wants to launch two people -- a man and a woman -- on a 501 - day , round - trip journey to @entity4 and back in 2018 without ever touching down			1
501 days in space with your spouse : could you handle it ? at this time there is no technology that can protect astronauts from an excess of space radiation			1
" the maximum number of days to stay with our standards is on the order of 500 days			0
so any mission that would exceed 500 days would not be doable , " @entity183 said			0
@entity220 agreed : " at this point it 's completely infeasible to try to send someone to @entity4 unless we can get there faster or we develop better shielding for a spacecraft			2
" @entity172 is working on engines intended to cut the travel time to @entity4 by the 2030s , but those systems wo n't be ready for many years , @entity278 , @entity172 's deputy director of advanced exploration systems , told @entity284 this year			2
in the meantime , @entity278 said engineers could try to limit travelers ' exposures by designing a spacecraft in such a way that it provides more protection			0
but @entity12 founder @entity27 insisted his group will get people landing on @entity4 by 2023			1
" the risks of space travel in general are already very high , so radiation is really not our biggest concern , " he said			2
if that all sounds good , you can still sign up			0
but remember : you can never go home again .			0

anyone 18 or older may apply for a one - way trip to @entity4
for first crew , the @entity12 mission *reportedly* will cost $ 6 billion
no technology is available now that can protect astronauts from an excess of space radiation
