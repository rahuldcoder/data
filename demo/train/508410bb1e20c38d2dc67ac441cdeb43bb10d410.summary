-- the secret election to pick a new pope has yet to begin			1
but whoever is picked may already be mulling over his choice of name -- and what it means			1
in the long history of popes , stretching back two millennia to @entity12 , some names have picked up negative associations , while others have come to signify conservatism or a desire for change			1
so what the new pontiff chooses may be one of the first clues to the course he intends to steer for the world 's 1.2 billion @entity24			0
for example , @entity26 , who served from 1939 to 1958 , was very conservative , said eminent @entity29 church historian @entity28			0
" if the new pope was to call himself @entity31 , it would be a very ideological choice , " he said			1
on the other side of the coin , a new pope that named himself @entity36 would be signaling an openness to reform			1
@entity39 was famed for calling the @entity40 in 1962 , which ushered in great changes in the @entity24 's relationship with the modern world			0
he was brave to pick the name @entity46 at all , says @entity28 , since the last man to hold the name is viewed as an " antipope " because he was elected pontiff during a schism in the church in the 15th century			2
@entity39 got away with it because he said it was in deference to his parish saint , @entity53 , @entity28 said			0
@entity58 , who gets to keep his name in rather than reverting to @entity58 in his unprecedented position as pope emeritus , meant his choice to be unifying			1
in his first general audience after taking office in 2005 , he told the crowds gathered in @entity66 that he wished to follow in the steps of @entity68 , who led the church through the turbulent years of the @entity70			0
" he was a true and courageous prophet of peace who struggled strenuously and bravely , first to avoid the drama of war and then to limit its terrible consequences , " @entity58 said			1
" in his footsteps i place my ministry , in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples			0
" the choice also evoked @entity84 , founder of the @entity86 order of monks , who helped spread @entity88 throughout @entity89 and was particularly venerated in @entity58 's homeland , @entity91			1
for the early popes , the choice of a name was n't an issue			2
it was n't until the end of the 10th century that the head of the church started taking a different name to the one he was born with , said @entity28			0
but since then only one , @entity102 in the 16th century , has kept his baptismal name			0
some were monks from countries other than @entity29 who wanted to create a link through their names to the great saints of @entity112			2
this was the start of the long list of popes named @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity84 , said @entity28			0
in fact , he added , the practice can be seen as typical of a dynasty without sons and daughters -- creating a sense of succession and a link to the earliest names in the church			1
in the @entity130 , @entity129 i was the first to create a composite name , in tribute to the two popes who had led the church through the @entity40 , which closed under @entity135 following @entity39 's death			0
he died barely more than a month later , putting him among the shortest - lived of popes			0
@entity140 , born @entity140 in @entity141 -- making him the first non-italian pope since the 16th century -- in turn wanted to show homage to that brief pontificate through carrying on the name , said @entity28			1
as the 115 cardinal - electors prepare to meet in the conclave , for the secret election to pick a new pope almost certainly from within their number , the sense of intrigue will only grow			1
" what you may find in the next few days will be the tendency not to try to guess who will be elected and and what name he will take , but to try to define the kind of pope they may hope for , " said @entity28			2
" there is a very conservative party within the cardinals who are hoping for @entity165 or @entity166 , " he said			0
others look to someone like archbishop @entity169 , of @entity170 , as a possible @entity129 , he said , while some of the @entity29 who want to see the papacy returned to one of their number talk about @entity36 in any case , any cardinal who 's in with a shot of the papacy would do well to do his homework			2
whoever first gains the two - thirds plus one share of the vote and is named pope wo n't have long to think about it			2
once all the votes are counted , the dean of the @entity189 will ask the newly elected head of the church on the spot if he accepts the role and what he wants to be called			0
while we wait to hear , we can be sure of only one thing , according to @entity28 : the new pope wo n't be called @entity12			1
this is out of respect for the first @entity12 , the @entity200 -- but perhaps also reflects a centuries ' old prophecy that a @entity203 will be the very last pope to serve			1
@entity0 's @entity205 contributed to this report .			0

the name chosen by the new pope could signal his *outlook* for the papacy
past names can carry a *message* of conservatism or openness to reform
@entity58 meant his choice of name to be unifying
no pope is likely to pick @entity12 -- in part because of a centuries ' old prophecy
