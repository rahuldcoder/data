@entity0 -- @entity2 will incur a $ 200m writedown on @entity4 , the action film based on the @entity7 novel which has failed at the box office despite a $ 300m production budget and an extensive global marketing campaign			1
the film about an @entity13 civil war hero who journeys to @entity14 is shaping up to be one of @entity17 's costliest flops			1
it has generated $ 184m in global ticket sales but with about half its takings going to cinema chains , @entity2 has had to adjust its earnings guidance for the quarter to reflect the film 's performance			1
the company said its " current expectation " is that its movie studio division will incur an operating loss of between $ 80m and $ 120m for the quarter following the release of the movie			0
the writedown deals a blow to @entity34 , the chairman of @entity35 , who has been trying to improve returns at the division following a restructuring and a focus on films made under the @entity2 , @entity42 and @entity43 brands			2
the studio has better prospects for the rest of the year , when it will release @entity47 , the latest film from @entity42 , and @entity49 , a superhero movie featuring characters such as @entity52 and @entity53			0
@entity2 said the two movies had " tremendous potential to drive value for the studio and the rest of the company "			0
however , the abject failure of @entity4 is not likely to be forgotten in an industry where a single flop can wipe out a studio 's annual profits			0
hopes were initially high for @entity4 : its director , @entity66 , had made the critically lauded and commercially successful @entity68 and @entity70 - @entity69 but the director openly admitted to struggling with the transition from animated film - making to live action directing			1
meanwhile , @entity7 ' source material , which inspired filmmakers such as @entity76 , has failed to energise young , male cinema goers , a crucial demographic for any big - budget action movie			2
the film comes a year after another costly @entity2 flop -- @entity83 -- but although it is likely to provoke some soul - searching at the company , privately executives are standing behind mr @entity66 and saying the company will continue to take risks in the pursuit of creative success			2
@entity4 was " greenlit " , or put into development , by the previous management regime at @entity2 's studio			1
since the departure of @entity95 , the former studio chairman , @entity2 has cut its marketing costs and reduced the headcount at its home entertainment division to reflect an industry - wide slump in dvd sales			0
it is also producing fewer movies , concentrating instead on distributing titles produced by @entity104 , the movie studio created by @entity105 , @entity42 and @entity43 , the comic book publisher it acquired in 2009 for $ 4bn			0
