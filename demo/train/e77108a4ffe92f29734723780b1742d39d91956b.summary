oh yeah , and do n't forget yolo			1
that 's the message from scholars at @entity10			0
for the 38th straight year , the tiny state college tucked away in @entity13 's @entity12 unveiled on monday its list of useless , overused or misused terms : 12 words or phrases the school wants " banished " from the @entity19 language in 2013			1
" i 'm in the word banishment business , " admits university pr director @entity20 , who helped whittle down the list from thousands of nominations submitted to the school 's website			1
" there 's a slightly serious side to this , but mostly we 're trying to have fun with it			0
" sure it 's fun			0
but it also makes you wonder why some new words stick and others do n't			1
@entity19 warmly welcomes some new words into its family for generations			1
but other words are treated like one - night stands			1
we love ' em and leave ' em. here 's the list : 1			1
@entity47 , an acronym for the phrase " you only live once " who needs " carpe diem " when you 've got yolo -- branded on @entity51 , in pop song lyrics and in celebrity tattoos			1
now it looks like yolo 's in trouble			2
@entity51 hashtag # @entity58 includes tweeters swearing off yolo forever			1
@entity47 is annoying because it encourages " wannabe @entity51 philosophers who think they 've uncovered a deep secret of life , " wrote @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity13 , who nominated the word for the list			2
sadly , poor little yolo 's story is all too common , says @entity71 , a linguist who teaches at the @entity72			1
" these words that are often very effective and attractive have very short half - lives because everybody picks them up at once , and they lose their punch , " says @entity71 , who calls this phenomenon the " nine - day wonder			2
" " if the words even last nine days at all			2
" related : ' @entity80 ' among annoying words of ' 12 , poll says the list takes shots at serious words , too : 2			1
fiscal cliff , a media term to describe expiring federal tax cuts and across - the - board government spending cuts which are set to become effective 12/31/2012 " just once , i would like to hear it referred to as a financial crisis , " wrote a nominator from @entity90 , @entity91			1
appropriately , her name is @entity95			0
" journalists always like cliffs , " @entity71 jokes			0
" there 's more pressure to use phrases like that , because if you soft peddle things , nobody 's going to read the story			2
" two other politically tinged phrases made the list			1
kick the can down the road , a metaphorical phrase that describes the concept of substituting a short - term fix in place of a final decision 4			0
job creator / creators , a person or business directly responsible for adding employed workers to the economy words like " job creators , " @entity71 says , represent an entire set of phrases that bubbled up during the 2012 presidential campaign			1
these words reflect recent changes in the way @entity129 talk about differing economic and social classes			2
" it 's the ' 47 % , ' the ' moochers , ' the ' makers and takers			0
' " these kinds of words , @entity71 suggests , fuel the fire of class warfare in @entity129 life			2
the list is peppered with words embraced by corporate culture , @entity71 says			1
passion / passionate , an intense devotion to an idea , thing or endeavor the popularity of this word results from the " bloating of the language of corporate life , " @entity71 says			0
" people are expected to manifest a kind of emotional attachment and investment in their jobs that was n't required back when jobs were a lot more secure			0
@entity161 , a nonscientific word for food with extremely high nutritional benefits it 's a term which @entity71 says shows how influential the explosion of marketing has become in our culture			0
another food word on the list : 7			2
boneless wings , small hand - held pieces of processed chicken without bones which are often enjoyed in sports bars " can we just call them chicken ( pieces ) ? " pleaded @entity177 , of @entity178 , @entity13 , who nominated the word			0
trending , currently popular " there are lots of ways to say it , but none in as few as eight letters , " jokes @entity71			2
" it 's a little trendy			0
" here 's one that @entity192 says has lost its meaning : 9			0
bucket list , a personal list of experiences people desire before they die , also known as " kicking the bucket " this one has got to go , says @entity192			1
there was a time when it could mean something like climbing a mountain , he explains			0
now a bucket list can include less - lofty pursuits -- like catching a two - for - one sale at the mall			1
rounding out the rest of the dozen : spoiler alert , guru and double down			2
words and phrases that almost made the list -- but failed : " wheelhouse , " " skill set			1
" also , @entity192 singled out an annoying phrase that fell under particular consideration			0
that phrase was , " i know , right			0
" says @entity192 , " that one came close			0
" what do you think ? here are some suggestions from @entity0 commenters : " @entity227 ' from weather references forever ! " writes snowdogg			1
" i would like to request that the words ' epic ' , ' chillax ' , and ' splitsville ' also be removed from the world 's vernacular , " suggests @entity229			1
also this gem , from gemurray : " the author uses one of the words that drives me crazy in the last couple of paragraphs - ' interwebs ' has got to go too ! it 's either ' @entity246 ' or ' @entity247 ' , there is no such thing as ' " interwebs ! ' " f - word and a-word the f - word and the a-word are often nominated for the list , but @entity192 says offensive words are n't considered			1
" we try to keep it lighthearted			2
" @entity71 's book , " @entity258 , " follows a * * hole from its invention by @entity261 to today , where the word has become a " basic term that a lot of us use all the time in our emotional and moral lives , for example when somebody cuts us off on the highway			0
" in fact , @entity71 says words from the 1940s -- like the a-word -- are more likely to survive than words invented in the ' 90s			2
" you 'd think more of the older words would be obsolete now , but no. " more words are being invented now than ever before -- partly because of easy and fast communication on the interwebs			1
( sorry , gemurray ) " but the more words that are produced increases the competition , " says @entity71			0
there 's a kind of process of natural selection			0
the words that survive often " become signs of important social movements or changes , " he says			0
the loser words will die -- never to be spoken again by countless mouths of future generations			0
hey little yolo , if you 're reading this , you better find some new friends			0
if you know what 's good for ya .			0
