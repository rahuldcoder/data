@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity4 government announced friday that more than 4,000 former @entity6 soldiers are entitled to settle in @entity7 , but @entity9 supporters quickly denounced the measure as meaningless			1
former @entity6 solider @entity11 was awarded @entity7 's highest honor for bravery , the @entity14			1
supporters have fought for years for more rights for the @entity9 , @entity17 soldiers who have been part of the @entity19 for nearly 200 years			1
gurkhas have fought alongside the @entity21 in every conflict in that period , including both world wars , and are known for their ferocity and pride			1
despite their centuries of service , @entity9 were not given the right to settle in the @entity4 until 2004			1
and even then the order applied only to those discharged after the @entity4 handover of @entity33 to @entity34 in 1997 , when the @entity35 moved from @entity33 to @entity7			1
the government 's announcement friday applies to all @entity9 , including those who left the army before 1997 , if they meet one of five criteria			1
it also says around 6,000 of the @entity9 ' dependents may be able to apply for settlement in @entity7 as well			0
" the guidance honors the service , commitment , and gallantry of those who served with the @entity35 , " @entity50 and immigration minister @entity51 said in a written statement			0
the @entity53 , however , said the government 's criteria for the @entity9 ' resettlement are unrealistic and too difficult for many of the soldiers to meet			2
" only a tiny fraction of the @entity9 who retired before 1997 will win settlement rights under the new policy , " the campaign said			2
" the campaign for full @entity6 justice will now be taken back into @entity65 and the courts			1
the government needs to know they will have a huge campaign against them who will commit to righting this wrong			2
" the @entity72 ruled last september that the 1997 cut - off date was fair , but added that caseworkers needed revised guidance on deciding the cases of @entity9 discharged before that date			0
under the guidance , @entity9 discharged before 1997 must meet one of five criteria to be considered for resettlement in @entity7 : have three years ' continuous residence in @entity7 , before or after service ; have close family settled in the @entity4 ; have an award for gallantry , leadership , or bravery while in the brigade ; have a chronic medical condition attributable to or made worse by army service ; have served for 20 or more years			1
actress @entity91 , whose father served in the @entity9 while she was a girl , has been an outspoken campaigner for their rights			0
she said the new criteria are harsher than she expected			0
" they 've given five bullet points which virtually can not be met by the ordinary @entity9 soldier , " @entity91 told reporters friday			0
" this one page of criteria has taken the government four months to come up with			2
it has made me ashamed of our administration			0
" she said most gurkhas are allowed to stay in the @entity4 for only two years , so three years of continuous residence is not possible			1
most gurkhas , she said , also have not been allowed to settle in @entity7 with their families			2
the requirement for having won an award discriminates against the ordinary soldier who has no award , she said			0
" this sends out not only to the @entity9 soldiers , but to our own men fighting in @entity120 and @entity121 , the most appalling message : that unless you have been awarded a medal for gallantry , you 're not a real soldier , " @entity91 said			0
only officers are allowed to serve 20 or more years , she said , so most riflemen will not qualify for the service requirement			0
and proving that an injury is related to army service will be nearly impossible for most , she said			0
" how on earth are men who were injured in the 1940s , ' 50s , ' 60s going to be able to prove that their long - term chronic illness is attributable to injures received during their service ? " she said			0
a @entity140 spokesman said the government believes hundreds of @entity9 will still be eligible to settle in @entity7			2
" we would not accept that , " the spokesman said of @entity91 's criticisms			0
" we would say that the criteria as we see it is fair and balanced			0
" the @entity6 brigade originated in the 19th century with @entity17 soldiers who impressed @entity4 imperial troops with their ferocity and military ability			1
the first @entity6 units were formed in 1815			1
they saw action in both world wars and were fundamental to the @entity4 military maintaining control of @entity158 in the 1800s			2
today there are 3,400 troops in the @entity6 brigade , operating from bases in @entity7			1
most recently , @entity6 troops were used in the @entity164 and the @entity166 conflicts .			1

@entity4 government *unveils* moves to let more former @entity6 troops live in the @entity4
gurkhas are part of @entity4 armed forces made up of @entity17 fighters
campaigners say qualifying criteria mean most will not be able to settle in @entity4
@entity6 units formed in 1815 and they fought in every campaign since
