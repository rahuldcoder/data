-- deaths of law enforcement officers in the line of duty fell sharply in 2008 , with the number killed by gunfire reaching its lowest level in more than five decades , according to a report published monday			1
a tougher criminal justice system is among the reasons cited for a less deadly year for police			2
the statistics show 2008 has been " one of the safest years for @entity17 law enforcement in decades , " wrote two groups : the @entity13 and @entity14			1
based on preliminary data , the groups found that 140 law enforcement officers were killed in 2008 -- 86 of them accidentally and 54 intentionally			1
just the year before , the group found 181 deaths -- 108 of them accidental and 73 intentional			0
" fewer officers were killed by gunfire in 2008 than in any year since 1956 , " the report says			0
" preliminary data indicate 41 officers died in firearms - related incidents this year , compared with 68 in 2007 , a reduction of 40 percent			0
" in a statement accompanying the report , @entity31 , chairman of the @entity13 , said , " 2007 was a wake - up call for law enforcement in our country , and law enforcement executives , officers , associations and trainers clearly heeded the call , with a renewed emphasis on officer safety training , equipment and procedures			1
" he listed reasons for the drop in officer deaths , including better training and equipment ; increased use of less - lethal weapons ; more officers wearing bullet - resistant vests ; and an increased awareness among officers that " every assignment is potentially life - threatening			1
" @entity31 also cited a downturn in violent crime in general and what he called a tougher criminal justice system			1
" the reduction in firearms - related deaths is especially stunning , given the tremendous firepower possessed by so many criminals today , " @entity31 added in the statement			0
the report 's figures are different from those held by the @entity72			1
for example , the @entity72 lists 140 law enforcement officers killed in 2007 -- 83 accidentally and 57 intentionally			1
the different figures are based on somewhat different criteria			0
for example , the @entity72 explains on its web site that it includes only officers who were " working in an official capacity " at the time of the incident			2
@entity83 , a spokesman for the @entity13 , said his group may include an officer who was intentionally killed , even if he was not working in an official capacity at the time			0
also , @entity83 said , " officers who die of a heart attack while engaging in a foot pursuit -- that may not make it into their report , but it 's in ours			2
" the @entity72 has not released totals for 2008			0
its preliminary report on law enforcement officer deaths in 2008 is expected in the spring			1
while the report released monday is largely about good news , it also includes some grim statistics			0
" deaths of female officers rose sharply to 15 in 2008 , equaling the record high of 2002			0
for the first time , more than 1 in 10 of the officers killed in a single year were women , " the report says			0
" and while overall traffic - related fatalities declined by more than 14 percent , the number of officers struck and killed rose in 2008 -- despite the increased publicity and enforcement of ' move over ' laws and other safety initiatives			2
