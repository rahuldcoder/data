-- millions of poor @entity2 children have untreated tooth decay , some of them because they can not find a dentist willing to treat them , a federal report issued tuesday said			1
only 1 in 3 children in @entity10 received any dental care over a year time span , according to a new report			1
" dental disease remains a significant problem for children aged 2 through 18 in @entity10 , " the @entity15 report concluded , referring to the federal / state health program for poor people			2
according to the report , which used data from 1999 to 2004 , about 6.5 million children enrolled in @entity10 had untreated tooth decay in 2005 and were nearly twice as likely as children with private health insurance to have untreated tooth decay			1
the @entity15 report was ordered after widespread publicity of the case of @entity30 , a 12 - year - old boy boy who died last year in suburban @entity31 when an untreated infected tooth led to a brain infection			1
driver " had extensive dental disease and his family was unable to find a dentist to treat him , " the report said			0
the report said 14.8 percent of @entity10 recipients said their children had not gotten necessary dental care because their dentist refused to accept @entity10 , which typically pays providers less than private insurers			1
" clearly , the oral health care system failed this young man , " said dr. @entity47 , first vice president of the @entity48 in testimony tuesday to the @entity50 and @entity51 on @entity52			0
" all of us -- practitioners , payers , parents and policymakers -- need to come together and make the system work for the most vulnerable among us , " she said			0
the report found that , nationwide , only one in three children in @entity10 had received any dental care in the year before the survey was carried out , and one in eight reportedly had never seen a dentist			1
in comparison , more than half of children with private health insurance had gotten dental care during the prior year			1
" fundamental changes to the @entity10 program are long overdue to prevent the possibility of future tragedies like @entity30 and to ensure that all low - income children have the same access to oral health care services enjoyed by the majority of @entity2 , " @entity72 said			2
efforts are under way to fix the problem			0
she cited plans to open eight dental schools in addition to the 57 currently in existence and said a new job -- community dental health coordinator -- has been created			0
the coordinators will be trained to work in clinics and schools to ensure emergency care is provided to children , she said			2
" if there had been a cdhc in the school that @entity30 attended , we believe this tragedy could have been prevented , " she said			0
" through a routine exam , a @entity98 could have spotted a simple cavity , filled the cavity with a temporary filling , and made arrangements for care by a dentist , " she said			0
the @entity98 will also help families enroll in @entity10 and get transportation to appointments , she said			0
but even if the numbers of dentists increase , @entity111 must act to increase fees for those participating in @entity10 to match private rates , she said .			2
