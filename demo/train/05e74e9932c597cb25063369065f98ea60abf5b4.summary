@entity0 is a writer and actor			1
his partner , @entity2 , is a guesthouse owner			1
together , they helped make history			2
after the clock struck midnight on friday , the couple were among the first men marrying men and women marrying women in a range of ceremonies across @entity13 and @entity14 as a historic law legalizing same - sex marriage finally comes into force			1
@entity0 and @entity2 have long known they wanted to commit officially and have waited five years for gay and lesbian couples to be able exchange vows legally in their home country			2
that day has finally come			2
" when we were born , it was illegal to be gay , let alone get married , " @entity0 , 49 , said during last - minute preparations ahead of the wedding			1
" i did n't think about the possibility for most of my life			2
it is only really recently that suddenly the option seemed to be on its way			2
" the marriage law was the final victory in a long battle that has secured the same age of consent as heterosexuals and the right to adopt. @entity13 and @entity14 are among 15 countries as well as parts of the @entity39 and @entity40 that allow same - sex marriage			1
the @entity42 was the first in 2001 , and last year @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 also joined the list			1
' they are equal ' going through final details with the wedding 's organizers earlier this week , @entity0 and @entity2 said they were excited beyond measure			2
the same - sex marriage bill was published by @entity57 's coalition government in january last year			1
in july , the legislation was approved to allow same - sex couples to officially marry in @entity13 and @entity14			1
prime minister @entity60 faced vocal opposition from some members of his @entity63			1
the @entity64 also objected , and was given an exemption from conducting same - sex ceremonies			1
but in a shift in tone ahead of the weddings , archbishop of canterbury @entity67 , leader of the world 's 80 million @entity69 , signaled the @entity64 would mount no more resistance to gay marriage among churchgoers as @entity77 had spoken			1
" i think the church has reacted by fully accepting that it 's the law , and should react on saturday by continuing to demonstrate in word and action , the love of @entity85 for every human being , " he told the @entity79 newspaper			1
in an article on @entity88 , an online magazine that focuses on the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgendered community , @entity60 said this weekend marked " an important moment for our country			2
" " it says we are a country that will continue to honor its proud traditions of respect , tolerance and equal worth , " he wrote			2
" it also sends a powerful message to young people growing up who are uncertain about their sexuality			2
it clearly says ' you are equal ' whether straight or gay			2
" a rainbow flag flew above government offices in @entity109 in celebration			0
battles remain @entity112 , which will hold a referendum on independence from @entity57 in september , last month became the latest to give the green light to gay marriage			1
the fourth @entity57 link , @entity118 , has stated it does not intend to introduce same - sex marriage legislation			1
gay couples in @entity57 have spent years campaigning for gay rights			0
civil partnerships were introduced in @entity13 and @entity14 in 2005 , effectively giving gay couples the same legal rights as heterosexuals			1
but campaigners insisted that only full equality would do			0
unlike @entity47 , where legalizing same - sex marriage prompted fierce opposition from many social conservatives and the @entity132 , there were no mass protests in @entity57			1
but for all the joy the weddings will bring , discrimination and bigotry remain issues in @entity57			0
in january , a local councilor was suspended from the anti-immigration @entity57 @entity140 ( @entity141 ) after blaming devastating floods on the legalization of gay marriage			1
" we never really hold hands in the street , we 're quite careful about those kind of things -- simply because it was always quite a dangerous thing to do			0
it 's still not entirely safe			0
our friends were beaten up six months ago for holding hands in the street , " @entity0 said			0
" now i am feeling slightly more relaxed about that kind of thing			0
i feel i have rights to be affectionate with this person that i am going to marry -- otherwise what does it represent ? " a recent @entity162 poll in @entity57 showed that most people support the new change in law allowing same - sex couples to marry , but a third still think gay people are treated worse than straight people			1
making a statement for @entity0 and @entity2 , the @entity170 is where they met when they first started dating , so it was a fitting venue for the next step in their relationship			0
they put much thought into personalizing the ceremony , which was attended by friends from as far away as @entity182 , and there was a cellist and songs sung by friends			0
the media also attended -- as with many of the first other same - sex weddings on saturday			1
the attention has been so huge that the local council has even received requests from ordinary @entity57 from across the country asking to attend @entity0 's and @entity2 's ceremony			0
for the couple , exchanging vows is not just about making a statement to each other , but to the world			0
" i think it 's important to make those kind of statements , be visible , be proud of who you are and what you are in a world which seems to be stepping backwards in lots of different places , " @entity0 said			0
" there are gay people struggling to be allowed to form relationships			0
" many couples getting married say they hope to send out messages of support to other gays facing discriminatory laws in their own countries			0
last month , @entity218 president @entity217 signed into law a bill that toughens penalties against gay people and defines some homosexual acts as crimes punishable by life in prison			1
in @entity229 , a " propaganda " law bans even discussion of homosexuality anywhere that children might hear it			1
" there are a lot of countries where it is illegal			0
we can show other countries that we are stepping forward , " @entity2 , 48 , said , adding he felt lucky and privileged			0
instead of gifts , the couple asked their guests to make a donation to @entity243 -- a charity that campaigns for equality and justice for lesbians , gay men and bisexuals			0
" i want the wedding day to be a fully celebratory experience but at the same time , i do n't want to forget that it 's a relative freedom , " @entity0 said			0
" we have n't reached the end of the line			0
there is still a long way to go			0
