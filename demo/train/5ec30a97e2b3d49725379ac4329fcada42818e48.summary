@entity0 -- @entity3 's political and economic attempts to stem the eurozone debt crisis may finally be getting results , @entity4 's @entity3 minister @entity2 has told @entity1			1
@entity2 told @entity1 a combination of political action and monetary intervention in the eurozone over the last month had put @entity3 on the road to economic recovery			1
" if we play our cards right , i think we will have turned the corner of this crisis , " he said			2
earlier this month , @entity19 president @entity18 announced a program to buy bonds of fiscally - frail countries such as @entity23 and @entity24			2
a week later , the @entity26 constitutional court green - lighted the @entity27 -- the region 's 500 billion euro ( $ 651 billion ) permanent bailout fund -- to come into force in october this year			0
a victory for @entity33 parties in the @entity35 elections this month was also a sign that electorates in northern @entity3 countries have not lost faith in the 17 - nation currency bloc			2
@entity2 told @entity40 was stuck in a " vicious cycle " between politicians , the media and the markets , which was hindering the speed of economic recovery			1
he said the issue was : " politicians talking loose stuff , media interpreting that loose stuff and then markets reacting to what the media reports			0
" @entity55 boss : @entity3 's a concern for us all @entity2 said debt - ridden countries like @entity23 and @entity24 were taking the necessary steps to reform but reiterated the @entity19 's message of conditionality in exchange for aid			1
he added : " i have a lot of respect for the @entity23 government because they have taken a lot of tough decisions in the past few months			0
" the 44 - year - old is in favor of a banking union -- a proposal from @entity76 which would give the @entity19 a supervisory role for more than 6,000 eurozone banks			0
but , he said , " we can not be in a situation where those banks which have taken care of their funds , have a good balance sheet , would be paying for those banks which have n't done so well			0
" @entity87 head : we need a @entity3 banking union @entity2 's comments follow his speech to @entity91 in @entity92 , @entity93 , in which he was skeptical over calls for a more integrated @entity3			1
of such an idea , he said : " we do not have the time , nor can we introduce an element of further uncertainty			0
" such a stance runs contrary to that of @entity102 president @entity101 , who told @entity40 needed to be more unified .			1

@entity4 's @entity3 minister @entity2 tells @entity40 's debt crisis may be *abating*
@entity102 president wants @entity3 to become more unified
but @entity2 says *treaty* change to solve the eurozone debt crisis is not the right *approach*
