-- @entity1 is a land under construction			2
last year , over $ 220 billion was spent on all kinds of building projects in the continent			1
while foreign architects have clamored to make their mark in the region , a range of local talent has also stepped forward to shape their landscape ( and in some cases , export their aesthetic abroad )			1
" @entity1 is constantly looking to the @entity15			2
it does n't always look in its own backyard , but the truth is , there 's a lot of very good indigenous knowledge on the continent , " says @entity16 , a professor of architecture at the @entity18 and editor the @entity1 edition of @entity21			1
in celebration of that knowledge , we take a look at some of @entity1 's most exciting contemporary architects			2
@entity35 born in @entity36 , " starchitect " @entity35 is the son of a @entity38 diplomat and spent his childhood traveling the globe before settling in @entity41 at the age of nine			1
the multi-award winning architect ( he has scooped up numerous accolades from both the @entity46 and the @entity47 ) has been tapped for a number of high - profile projects over the years , most recently the @entity50 in @entity51 and the @entity52 in the @entity53 , @entity54			2
though @entity35 's projects span the globe , he has numerous projects in @entity1 , including designing the @entity59 resort , in @entity38			1
in 2012 , he opened an office in @entity38 's capital , @entity62			2
@entity63 @entity63 , the @entity64 - born founder of @entity65 , made waves last year with the completion of one of his designs : a floating , three - story a-frame school built in @entity72 , a slum on the waterfront of @entity74 , @entity64			1
bobbing on top of about 250 empty barrels , the school is designed to avoid many of the problems associated with frequently rising water levels			2
the structure is also green : it makes use of rainwater collection , and solar panels provide the electricity			2
though the school accommodates a mere 100 elementary school children , it has potential to act as a model for water - bound communities the world over			2
" it did n't start as a big idea , i was trying to solve a small problem the community had			2
i realized the problem i was trying to solve was a problem for a larger part of the world , " @entity96 told @entity0 last year			0
" we 're now seeing people take interest in this across @entity1			0
" @entity106 @entity105 @entity106 @entity105 's humble beginnings in the small village of @entity109 , @entity110 , have granted him a useful alternate perspective on the architectural needs of his countrymen			1
" @entity105 is deeply grounded in the values of @entity1 society , " says @entity16			1
" he 's really the one person trying to transcend tradition and find a new kind of direction that locates architecture within the global self			1
" though his firm , @entity121 , is based in @entity122 , he is also committed to reinvesting his knowledge back into his home country			0
@entity110 's landscape is dotted with schools he designed -- a revolutionary approach that replaces concrete with earth bricks and employs a corrugated steel roof that is raised to allow air for better circulation			0
the idea is twofold : firstly , a cooler classroom will help improve the student 's concentration			0
secondly , by employing local materials and labor , @entity105 helps empower the local community			1
his efforts have earned him a series of awards , including the prestigious @entity142			1
@entity143 for @entity146 architect @entity145 , design is not merely aesthetic ; it 's democratizing			1
in both his redesign of the @entity148 and the @entity149 , @entity145 has been significant in putting forth a post-apartheid aesthetic ( for example , for the railway station he removed the two separate entrances that -- during the apartheid era -- had been used used to segregate black and white passengers )			0
@entity156 , of which @entity143 is the principal and founder , has been the recipient of several awards , including two @entity161 from the @entity162			1
though @entity146 is still very close to @entity145 's heart , he dreams of having international influence as well			1
in 2008 , he was part of the prestigious @entity166 ( @entity167 handpicked 100 architects globally to put forth designs for the industrial @entity171 city )			0
@entity172 heading up the @entity173 , @entity146 architect @entity172 also believes in using architecture as a means of social reform			0
in 2012 , he won a @entity177 for converting an old shipping container into a classroom in rural @entity1			0
the colorful classroom featured an outdoor jungle gym , windows to allow for cross ventilation , a steel roof that can collect rain water , and an outdoor amphitheater for school events			0
" @entity172 does a lot of really interesting , innovative work with containers , " notes @entity16			0
read this : @entity1 's hottest new fashion designers @entity193 @entity194 architect @entity193 is a leader when it comes to environmental design			1
his mission has always been to create buildings that are not only sustainable , but low - maintenance , low - cost and which blend into their natural surroundings			0
nature is often a great source of inspiration for @entity193			0
one of his best - known buildings , for instance , the @entity208 in @entity209 , @entity194 , employed a sustainable temperature control system , using tubes in the walls to move air through the building , based on the system employed by termites			0
he used a similar model for @entity219 , a mixed - use development in @entity221 , @entity222			0
@entity223 @entity146 - based @entity223 -- manned by partners @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 -- has become synonymous with sleek , contemporary , high - end design			1
the firm does a good business in high - end resorts , swank private residences and glimmering commercial centers			0
" their architecture is very glam , very wallpaper - ish , " says @entity16			0
" they have built for a lot of @entity1 clients , mainly the elite			0
" the studio , which has a team of 90 designers and technicians , an in - house cgi team and a branch dedicated to furniture and interior design , has pulled in a slew of awards			1
most recently , they won an @entity252 and an @entity253 from the @entity254 for a vacation house in @entity256 , in the @entity257 , a luxurious residence with a large garden and courtyard pool that measures a mere 45 - feet wide			0
@entity260 and @entity261 @entity1 architects @entity260 and @entity261 could very well be in line for some awards this year for renovating a former gas station , car dealership and dental school into the @entity268 , according to @entity16 : " they turned it into something beautiful and poetic , " he says .			1
