-- not even on @entity1 am i much of a romantic			1
i hardly ever think to buy flowers for my wife or plan fun getaways , and i rarely remember our anniversary			1
to be fair , neither does she			0
we 're usually reminded of our anniversary only when her mother 's congratulatory card arrives with a little check tucked inside			1
oh yeah , we think			0
it 's that time of year again			0
how many years has it been ? which anniversary is this ? paper ? copper ? sometimes i have to take off my wedding ring and look at the date , which is etched inside			1
in the card my mother - in - law will have written : " spend this on a nice dinner out for the two of you ! " " how sweet of her , " @entity27 will say			1
" she 's so nice to do this every year , " i 'll say			0
and then we 'll deposit the check in our mutual checking account and promise ourselves a nice dinner out , which usually fails to materialize			0
maybe a portion of that check will go toward the electric bill , which powers our air conditioner , which keeps us cool and comfortable in the hot summer months			0
that 's kind of romantic , right ? not really			1
what can i say ? romance just is n't in our dna			1
and yet i spend my days reading other people 's love stories			2
for the past 10 years i 've edited a column in the @entity46 called " @entity47 , " in which strangers write personal essays spilling the details of their love lives for a mass audience			1
a lot of their stories are n't very romantic , either , but many of them are : tales of swooning singletons traveling great distances for love , or planning elaborate proposals , or pouring their hearts out in ways that expose them to crushing rejection			1
stories like that make me think i should be more romantic			1
but at this point , @entity27 and i have been married almost 22 years			1
our patterns are kind of established			0
we love each other and support each other 's work and aspirations			1
we 're good parents together			1
we 're really good at making each other laugh			1
at dinner parties , we 'd still rather sit next to each other than be broken up and forced to talk to other people			2
is n't that enough ? i know what you 're thinking			2
this guy is hopeless ! and not in the sense of being a hopeless romantic ! some say romance is dying in this age of commercialized and computerized matchmaking			2
they say romance is being killed by a world of constant communication			0
how can you miss someone when you can facetime with him or her 24/7 ? where is the mystery when you can follow each other 's @entity101 feed and @entity104 posts at work during the day or when away on a business trip ? i 've even heard of husbands and wives using " @entity110 " to locate their spouses if they 're not answering calls or texts , as if the thing was invented to serve as a gps tracking device			0
and after our laptop locates the signal , we think : oh , she 's just at @entity120			0
oh , he 's just walking the dog down by the river			0
not a lot of mystery there			0
if absence makes the heart grow fonder , what does continual presence do ? make the heart grow bored ? with @entity27 and me , technology has nothing to do with our unromantic affliction			1
our love has sidestepped romantic traditions from the beginning			1
we got engaged on a ferry boat in @entity142			0
that 's romantic , right ? well , not for us			2
we had departed from @entity144 , bound for @entity145 , when @entity27 said , " so are we getting married , or what ? " " yeah , we should , " i said			1
even though i had n't proposed			2
had n't pulled a hidden ring box from my pocket or sock and presented it to her with a big , goofy smile			2
had n't memorized or delivered any heartfelt lines			2
i do n't even think we kissed			2
by then we had been together for almost two years			2
we were both 29 , nearing the end of our graduate school days , and obviously had to figure out what was next for us			0
our marriage and family clock was ticking , and our parents ' expectations were mounting			1
i wanted to marry @entity27 and assumed we would get married , and yet i had n't taken a single step in that direction			1
why had n't i ? i wish i could claim some standard excuse like cold feet or commitment issues or a laundry list of doubts , but it would n't be true			2
i was n't worried about @entity27 specifically or about marriage generally			1
i expected it would all work out fine			0
i was n't concerned about joining her family or her joining mine			2
i was simply procrastinating because i did n't want to face the work and stress that proposing and then planning a wedding would require			2
as we steamed past @entity180 ( no prison symbolism intended ) , @entity27 asked if i had any thoughts about a ring			1
" no , " i said			0
" but i 'll ask my mother			0
in the end , though , my mother delivered			0
she had a family heirloom kind of ring with a little diamond chip that we got sized for @entity27 's finger , and that made it official			1
some months later , during our pre-wedding planning , we went to a strip mall in @entity195 , @entity196 , and ordered matching gold bands			0
as we walked out , i felt a little misty eyed , and i do n't think it was just because of the pollution			0
some months later we walked down the aisle			0
and later that night we strode into our fancy hotel room , where i pulled from my pockets the cash and checks people had given us , and i scattered the loot all over the bed			0
no one had told me that people tend to stuff money into the groom 's pockets at weddings , and i have to say it felt really romantic to lie in all that cash together on a king - size hotel bed			0
we had turned our love into marriage			1
it was the start of everything			0
it 's a date that will be etched forever in -- my ring			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity226 .			1

@entity226 and his wife , @entity27 , are n't romantic ; they do n't ever remember their anniversary
@entity226 edits a " love " column in which strangers tell tales of swooning love , romantic *longing*
their marriage has lasted 22 years without the flowers and the *chocolates* , he says
@entity226 : they support each other , laugh and talk together , and make a good pair of parents
