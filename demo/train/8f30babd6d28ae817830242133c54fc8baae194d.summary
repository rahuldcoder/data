-- most kids can freely snack at recess , but a growing number of @entity6 children have food allergies that can lead to serious reactions if the wrong ingredient gets into their mouths			1
@entity11 , 7 , of @entity12 , died january 2 of cardiac arrest and anaphylaxis , according to a statement from @entity17 police			1
the girl had received a peanut from another child unaware of @entity22 's allergy , police said			2
@entity23 ate the peanut on the playground , and then approached a teacher , who took her to the school clinic			0
school personnel , responding police officers and firefighters were unable to save her life , and she was declared dead at @entity32			0
detectives determined that no crime or criminal negligence occurred as a result of the actions of school personnel , @entity23 's mother or the child who gave @entity23 the peanut , police said			0
there is no cure for food allergies , and a person can develop them at any age			1
the only treatments available are antihistamines for mild reactions and injected epinephrine for anaphylaxis -- severe , life - threatening reactions in which the airway closes and the person is unable to breathe			1
to make matters worse , food allergies are on the rise , although no one knows why			1
the number of kids with food allergies increased 18 % from 1997 to 2007 , according to the @entity64			1
last year , researchers found that 8 % of children under age 18 in the @entity6 have at least one food allergy			1
@entity0 received more than 1,000 comments from readers responding to the initial report of @entity23 's death , many of which questioned the responsibility of the school			0
some readers said portable epinephrine injectors should be on hand at all schools and child - care institutions			1
" and what if a child has their first reaction at a school ( i.e. , they did n't know they were allergic ) ? it would be their last reaction if the school is not properly equipped to handle it , " commenter @entity86 wrote			1
most school districts have some sort of written policy on food policy management , said @entity96 , chief executive officer of the @entity97			2
normally , epinephrine prescribed to individual students is kept at school			2
" all the school policies i 'm aware of require the parent to turn in the medication and to have the school keep it readily on hand , " she said			0
and some states have schools that allow students , with appropriate consent , to carry their prescribed medication on them ( @entity96 's organization keeps this list of states and their policies )			2
some states , but not the majority , allow schools to have a stock of epinephrine -- not specifically prescribed to anyone -- to give in an emergency to any student who is suffering from an anaphylactic reaction			1
they may also permit the training of teachers and other staff in the use of epinephrine injectors			2
lawmakers are paying attention to the issue			0
legislation introduced to the @entity136 and @entity137 toward the end of 2011 , the @entity133 to @entity134 , encourages states to require schools to have a stock of epinephrine that can be used for any student who is having an allergic reaction			1
by some estimates , 25 % of allergic reactions that occur in school involve children not known to have had an allergy before , @entity96 said			1
and it 's a myth that a person 's first allergic reaction wo n't be a serious one , doctors say			1
there 's no way to know how severely a child will react to any given food to which he or she has a known allergy ; any exposure may result in reactions ranging from nothing to a few hives to an inability to breathe			1
" the more staff at a school that are trained on food allergy safety , the safer the environment for kids with food allergies , " @entity96 said			1
even if you think your child is having an allergic reaction to a food for the first time , it 's likely that he or she has been exposed before , in utero , or through contact , or when it has been an ingredient in other foods			1
once sensitization occurs , allergy can ensue , says dr. @entity185 , fellow of the @entity186 and an allergist based in @entity188			2
@entity96 's oldest daughter had a reaction to peanuts the first time she ate them , when she was less than 2 years old			1
two injections of epinephrine saved her life			2
it is possible to develop an allergy at any age ; to some extent , it is unpredictable			0
but there are certain risk factors : a strong evidence of family history , seasonal and indoor allergies , eczema and asthma			0
a child with one or more of those should be evaluated for food allergies by a board - certified allergist , said @entity185 , also a fellow of the @entity213			1
an allergy test can help identify which foods may put a child at risk of anaphylaxis and other reactions			0
tiny doses of allergen are placed under the skin , and those that produce a small bump are the likely problem foods			0
unfortunately , this test does not predict how severe a reaction to eating that food would be			2
education is key to managing food allergies , @entity185 said			1
knowing what foods to avoid , learning how to read ingredient labels on food products and taking the initiative to ask about problem foods when eating outside the home are all essential			0
" preparedness is part of the overall goal , " he said			0
every child at risk of food - allergic reactions should have an allergy action plan on file with the school that is signed by a doctor , and an epinephrine injector available at school , @entity185 said			1
the @entity97 has an emergency action plan online you can adapt to your needs for school and other child - care purposes			0
a person who is experiencing anaphylaxis needs to receive epinephrine immediately ; rapid decline and death can occur within 30 to 60 minutes , according to the @entity259			0
repeat doses may be necessary , which is why doctors recommend having two epinephrine auto - injectors on hand in case of emergency			2
during a reaction , the offending food or substance should be removed from the mouth or skin immediately , and the auto - injector should be injected into the thigh muscle			1
call 9 - 1 - 1 or if already in a hospital , summon a resuscitation team , the @entity259 says			0
some @entity0 readers called for better health support in schools : kinderlove : every school nurse should have an [ epinephrine auto - injector ]			1
ajkf : every school should have a nurse			0
the @entity282 agrees on both points			0
about 75 % of schools in the country have access to a school nurse , and about 25 % do not have any access to a school nurse			2
between 40 % and 50 % have a full - time nurse			2
there 's not really a shortage of school nurses ; there 's a shortage of funded positions , said @entity298 - @entity297 , president of the organization			0
" children need to have a school nurse so that their health conditions can be well - managed , " she said			2
" healthy kids do learn better			0
" it 's rare , but it has happened that when there is a clear emergency , a school nurse would use an epinephrine injection that was prescribed for another student , she said			0
this action would be controversial , however -- one problem is that the other student could have had a reaction at the same time or shortly thereafter , and their medication would have been used			0
" the cost of epinephrine is so much less than the value of a child 's life , " @entity317 said			0
" it would make a lot of sense to have epinephrine available , and have a school nurse in the building every day , and have people besides the school nurse who are trained in case there is an emergency			0
