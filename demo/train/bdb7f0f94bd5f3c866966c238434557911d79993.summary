@entity0 -- a new @entity3 bill is the first proposed legislation to curb so - called police militarization after the disturbances in @entity7 , @entity8			1
sen. @entity9 , @entity10 , is sponsoring the legislation , which would block state and local police from receiving broad categories of military - grade equipment , including @entity16 rifles , @entity18 vehicles and camouflage equipment			1
he also proposes to require local police that have received such equipment in recent years to return it to the @entity22			2
" @entity18 " is shorthand for a mine - resistant , ambush - protected vehicle , something usually associated with war zones			0
the legislation is a test of the strength of the congressional backlash against the much criticized heavy police response to demonstrations in the @entity34 suburb after the police shooting of 18 - year - old @entity37			1
televised images of camouflaged police in tank - like vehicles launching tear gas canisters and concussion grenades at protesters in @entity7 prompted criticism from both liberals and conservatives			2
president @entity48 and attorney general @entity49 also criticized the heavy response , which they said appeared to inflame the disturbances , not quell them			0
@entity53 : police militarization , war on drugs are " out of control " the @entity59 and @entity22 have announced reviews of the federal programs			2
@entity63 sen. @entity62 , in whose home state the disturbances occurred , led a congressional hearing this month that scrutinized programs run by the @entity22 and the @entity70 and justice departments to help local police departments obtain surplus military equipment and buy new armor			1
the programs are mostly operated with the aim of helping local cities prepare for possible terrorist attacks			0
but cities are n't restricted in how they use the equipment , for instance using them in response to hurricanes and national disasters and to prepare for street protests			0
at the hearing , federal authorities said they did n't have ways to track what happens with the equipment once it is in the hands of local authorities , and in some cases the equipment has gone missing			0
opinion : the real reason @entity7 has military weapons it 's not clear how much support @entity9 , a conservative senator , will receive for his bill			1
but sentiment in @entity101 appears to support at least some changes to the current program			0
@entity9 wants the @entity22 to seek congressional approval before transferring any new types of equipment under the surplus program and to maintain a public website that reports all transfers			1
the proposed bill would also restrict the @entity70 and justice departments ' grant programs from giving money to cities to buy drones , surveillance equipment , ballistic helmets and lethal weapons .			0

sen. @entity9 's bill would block cops from getting some types of military equipment
@entity125 , @entity59 criticized heavy police response in @entity7 , @entity8
@entity22 *officials* say they have no way of tracking equipment once it 's given to police
