@entity0 -- a judge declared a mistrial monday in actress @entity5 's wrongful termination lawsuit against " @entity6 " creator @entity7 and @entity8			1
the jury told the judge they were deadlocked at 8 - 4 , in favor of the actress , after three days of deliberations			1
they needed nine jurors to agree on a verdict			0
@entity5 sued , claiming her character was killed -- and her acting job eliminated -- in retaliation for her complaining that @entity7 hit her during a rehearsal for the @entity8 comedy			1
lawyers for @entity7 and @entity8 's @entity22 argued the demise of her character was a creative decision unrelated to the workplace complaint			1
@entity8 executives testified that @entity7 gained their permission to have @entity28 -- the sassy blonde played by @entity5 -- die in may 2008 , four months before an incident in which @entity7 allegedly struck @entity5			1
the hit during a rehearsal was just " a light tap on the head " intended to demonstrate " a piece of physical humor " @entity7 wanted @entity5 to perform , the defense said in opening statements			2
@entity5 testified that @entity7 hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene			2
" it was a nice wallop to my head " she said			0
one juror who voted for @entity5 's case said afterward that the defense story " just did n't hold water for me			1
" @entity47 , a retired elementary school principal , said her decision to find the studio liable was based on her doubts about the credibility of several defense witnesses , which included high - level @entity8 executives			1
" there were a lot of people that some of the jurors found not too credible , " @entity47 said			0
juror @entity60 , who also voted for @entity5 's side , said it seemed to him that @entity8 executives scripted their stories " just a little bit			1
" " i do n't say they was scripted , " @entity65 said			0
" it 's more like the story do n't match for me			2
" @entity5 lawyer @entity71 said while there was no victory , the jury 's 8 - 4 vote did send a message to @entity8 and parent company @entity75			1
" they had 10 witnesses tell their little scripted story , with no documents , and eight jurors looked at their best , their presidents , and said , ' no , i 'm not buying it , i 'm not buying what you 're selling , mr. president , ' " @entity71 said			0
lawyers will now prepare for a retrial , because an out - of - court settlement is not expected , he said			0
" my view is that @entity75 is the unhappiest place on @entity91 , so why would there ever be a settlement offer ? " @entity71 said			0
@entity8 lawyer @entity94 said the retrial will be " far more narrow than the previous case " since the judge tossed out @entity5 's battery complaint , leaving only the wrongful termination issue against the studio			1
in fact , @entity7 is no longer a defendant , he said			0
the jury of nine women and three men began deliberating on wednesday but told the judge on monday morning they were hopelessly deadlocked			2
although the show 's line producer reported the hitting incident to the studio 's human resources department , there was no investigation until an @entity8 senior executive saw a @entity115 story about it at a grocery store two months later , according to testimony			1
what followed was a " fake " investigation designed " to protect the money machine known as ' @entity6 , ' " @entity71 said			0
" nobody wants the ' @entity6 ' applecart turned upside down			0
" the human resources investigator did not interview @entity7 or @entity5 about the incident , only three people who worked for @entity7 , @entity71 said			2
five months and 11 episodes after the rehearsal incident , @entity7 informed @entity5 that @entity28 would die during a show taping the next day , ending her five - year run on " @entity6			2
" " to my estimation , it was n't handled correctly , " juror @entity47 said			0
" it was n't handled the way it should have been handled			0
" @entity5 was asking for $ 5.7 million in damages from @entity8 and @entity7 , although the actress was paid $ 4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series .			1
