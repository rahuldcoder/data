@entity2 president @entity0 says he does n't consider @entity4 's hack of @entity5 " an act of war			1
" " it was an act of cybervandalism , " @entity0 said in an interview with @entity1 's @entity9 that aired sunday on " @entity10			2
" @entity0 said that the @entity13 is going review whether to put @entity4 back on a list of states that sponsor terrorism			1
" we 've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism			0
and we do n't make those judgments just based on the news of the day , " he said			0
" we look systematically at what 's been done and based on those facts , we 'll make those determinations in the future			0
" the president stuck by his criticism of @entity5 's decision to cancel its plans to release the movie " @entity36 , " which includes a cartoonish depiction of the assassination of @entity4 leader @entity39 , after the country threatened attacks against theaters that showed it			1
@entity0 said in a friday news conference that @entity5 made " a mistake , " and that he wished the company had called him first			1
that led @entity49 ceo @entity48 to tell @entity1 that @entity0 and the public " are mistaken as to what actually happened			2
" he blamed movie theater companies that opted not to show the film , saying they forced @entity5 's hand			1

" the president told @entity9 that his problem was n't with @entity5 specifically , but with the precedent the company 's decision set			1
the @entity74 on friday pinned blame on @entity4 for a hack into @entity5 's computer systems			1
@entity0 said both foreign governments and hackers outside government present cyberthreats that are part of the modern business landscape			0
" if we set a precedent in which a dictator in another country can disrupt through cyber , a company 's distribution chain or its products , and as a consequence we start censoring ourselves , that 's a problem , " @entity0 said			2
" and it 's a problem not just for the entertainment industry , it 's a problem for the news industry , " he said			0
" @entity1 has done critical stories about @entity4			0
what happens if in fact there is a breach in @entity1 's cyberspace ? are we going to suddenly say , are we not going to report on @entity4 ? " so the key here is not to suggest that @entity5 was a bad actor			1
it 's making a broader point that all of us have to adapt to the possibility of cyberattacks , we have to do a lot more to guard against them			0
" @entity48 , speaking to @entity1 's @entity111 , said he was " disappointed " in what @entity0 said friday			1
" we have not given in			0
and we have not backed down			0
we have always had every desire to have the @entity13 public see this movie , " @entity48 said			0
but that 's not what the company initially said after canceling the film 's release			1
on wednesday night , a studio spokesperson said simply , " @entity5 has no further release plans for the film			2
" the nonprofit @entity124 is pushing a campaign called @entity126 , inviting " those who support freedom and democracy " to " help @entity4 defectors amplify , refine , and intensify efforts to break the monopoly of information " that the regime imposes on its people			2
