has evolved into a new debate : is the @entity2 really about more than taxes ? @entity8 , who invokes the semi-mythical " @entity9 " -- fighting preachers he claims led the @entity11 -- as a model for a new generation of activists seems to think so			2
on public radio , @entity15 , a leader of the fundamentalist @entity16 , sternly instructed a libertarian @entity2 activist that her movement was religiously rooted whether she wanted it to be or not			2
a recent poll by the @entity23 backs him up , revealing that 57 percent of self - identified @entity24 agree that " @entity5 is and always has been a @entity26 nation			0
" so is the @entity2 a religious movement , too ? the answer is a little tricky			1
it did n't begin as one , despite the political @entity31 - talk of its heroine , @entity32 , but it is becoming one , thanks in large part to one man , sen. @entity37 of @entity38 , @entity39 , the @entity41 's newest and fastest rising star			1
@entity37 , who has been out front of his party with vigorous support for @entity2 candidates from @entity46 to @entity47 , has been looked at as a bridge builder between the insurgent right and the establishment right , because he sympathizes with the former even as he 's a @entity51 insider			1
but a better metaphor is gatekeeper : @entity37 holds the key to the capital for outsider candidates like @entity46 's @entity57 and @entity47 's @entity58			1
and the price of admission he 's charging is fealty to his religious vision of the @entity2 as a new " @entity63			1
" that is , a @entity26 crusade akin to the 18th century evangelical movement that set the tone for so many religious surges in @entity5 life that many contemporary evangelicals call the @entity5 a " revival nation			2
" the @entity41 -- at least , the establishment @entity41 -- does n't have a lock on that energy			2
in @entity46 , sen. @entity75 was a reliable conservative , but primary challenger @entity57 swept past her in september buoyed by anti-abortion voters who thrilled to his pledge to oppose " the culture of death			0
" in @entity47 , @entity81 rep. @entity81 was a sure thing for @entity85 's old @entity84 seat -- until he got beat by " fringe " candidate @entity58 , previously best known for her public campaign against masturbation			0
liberals and centrists wring their hands over @entity57 and giggle about @entity58 , hoping that her political hopelessness somehow proves that the movement is n't going			0
they compile lists of what they take to be her craziest statements , such as her confession that as a young woman she dabbled in witchcraft			0
that 's a strategic mistake , because they 're mocking what is , in fact , a mainstream evangelical view -- that witchcraft and " spiritual war " are real -- and a narrative with powerful resonance in @entity5 life			0
consider not @entity58 's words , but her theme : once i was lost ( making bad choices ) , but now i 'm found			0
who did n't do something stupid in their youth ? but it 's the " found " part that reveals the religiosity of the @entity2 movement , spirituality not at odds with the @entity2 's economics but intertwined with it			1
@entity37 stumbled through an explanation for the @entity128 : " people are seeing this massive government growing and they 're realizing that it 's the government that 's hurting us			1
and i think they 're turning back to @entity31 in effect is our salvation and government is not our salvation and in fact more and more people see government as the problem , and so i think some have been drawn in over the years to a dependency relationship with government , and as the @entity144 says , you ca n't have two masters			0
" @entity37 's solution is to put government -- and the economy -- in the service of @entity150 , to cultivate a " leadership led by @entity31 , " as the religious organization that gives @entity37 not only a theology but also a roof puts it			1
@entity37 is a longtime resident of the @entity155 , the " @entity157 , " as some bloggers have called it , made infamous in 2009 for its role in the sex scandals of sen. @entity161 , @entity162 , and gov. @entity163 , @entity162 - @entity39 , and maintained by a fundamentalist movement known as the @entity165			1
@entity155 has a singular goal , in the words of one @entity168 : to " assist [ congressmen ] in better understandings of the teachings of @entity150 , and applying it to their jobs			0
" it 's @entity155 's understanding of those teachings , though , that mark it as a nexus for the convergence of the @entity2 's populist conservatism and insider influence of fundamentalism 's elite ( besides @entity37 , @entity41 hard right leaders sen. @entity182 , @entity161 , sen. @entity183 , and sen. @entity184 have lived there )			1
the best way to help the weak , @entity155 teaches , is to help the strong , who will in turn dispense @entity31 's blessings to the rest of us			0
call it trickle down religion			0
the rhetoric of the @entity2 is populist in style , but its economic vision so neatly aligns with the interests of the wealthy that big business is abandoning the old @entity41 establishment for the " insurgents " who promise to free the market 's " invisible hand " from the safety net of the minimum wage and health care			1
and for @entity37 and the new disciples he hopes to bring to @entity51 , that invisible hand ultimately belongs not to the market but to @entity31			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity214 says anti-tax @entity2 shows signs of evolving into religious movement
he says @entity41 star sen. @entity37 is gatekeeper for @entity2 candidates to establishment
price of admission , he says , is fealty to @entity37 's religious vision of @entity2
@entity214 : putting government in service of religion tends to align it with interests of wealthy
