@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the beginning the question was whether we could do it at all			2
around - the - clock news ? was there even enough news to fill 24 hours ? those were the questions being asked when i joined the staff of @entity2 on february 4 , 1980 , five months before the network went on the air			1
i had come to @entity2 from the @entity17 via a six - year stint at @entity19			1
aside from knowing how to write a five - minute newscast for the broadcast wire , i knew nothing about television			1
that day i was told i would be the broadcast industry 's first full - time copy editor			1
even at the networks , it seemed , producers had read scripts , but with 24 hours of news , editors had been added to the team			1
down to the last few minutes before we went on the air at 6 p.m. on june 1 , 1980 , there were doubts about whether we could do it			1
@entity37 was the fast - talking , endlessly energetic vice president whose job was not only to get us on the air but make our shows interesting			1
as the clock ticked down , he called the show team into the back where the executive offices were located			1
" listen , " he intoned			2
" we do n't know if this is going to work or not			2
if it does n't work , we will all go to tv stations and hire one another			2
" and on that cheery note , out we went to produce the first show			2
we had been asked to tie our futures to the dreams of @entity55 , someone many considered to be a mad man			1
not only were we ready , but eager			2
as @entity55 was dedicating the news channel to @entity60 , i was marking up seven - part scripts with a black copy pencil in the newsroom downstairs			1
and by the end of that first hour , i knew the answer to the question of whether @entity2 would survive			1
civil rights leader @entity68 had been shot and was in a @entity70 , @entity71 , hospital			2
that day his friend , president @entity72 , flew to @entity70 to visit his bedside			1
when @entity72 came out of @entity68 's room and stepped up to the waiting microphones , @entity2 was live			1
the three broadcast networks would air portions of @entity72 's remarks later on their 30 - minute evening newscasts , but @entity2 was live as it happened			1
as i listened to @entity72 speak , i thought to myself , " you know , this is going to work			2
cell phones were still a few years away			2
there was no @entity85 , but people could look at @entity2 and see history unfold before their eyes			1
a cartoon in the @entity91 magazine from that time showed a dead bird , its feet in the air and a @entity2 cameraman capturing the event			1
" a sparrow falls , " said the caption , " and @entity2 goes live			1
" there were countless important events in those first years			1
the arrival of the hostages who had been freed by @entity104 in 1981 , the chaos following the shooting of president @entity107 that year , and those unforgettable images as the @entity109 blasted off into a clear blue @entity111 sky in january 1986 only to explode a few moments later			1
a breakthrough moment came with the start of the @entity115			2
that war produced something called " @entity118			2
" as video of bombs falling on targets and reports from the field streamed in , people were reluctant to be away from their televisions			0
they carried pocket radios into business meetings to listen to @entity2			1
they were unwilling to be unplugged , and it was more than exciting to be a part of it			0
in 1993 , @entity2 created its own internal wire service , the @entity133 , and i was one of three members of that fledgling staff			1
we were to be the repository of what @entity2 knew because our charge was to cover the major story of the day			1
in 1994 , it included a slow chase down a @entity144 freeway			0
when caught , @entity145 was charged with murdering his wife , @entity146			0
my colleague @entity147 and i watched and filed dispatches on every day of the trial			1
in 1996 , i went to @entity150 to cover the first democratic election of a @entity153 president			0
@entity154 danced on the stage at @entity156 and swept past the @entity157 to win			0
then followed four trips to @entity159 to cover elections there			0
one evening my colleague @entity161 invited me to visit his home in @entity163 , a mixed neighborhood in @entity164 where @entity159 and @entity165 live			0
the cab driver was a little reluctant but took me anyway			0
on the terrace roof of @entity161 's home that summer evening we ate cool slices of watermelon and sipped @entity159 wines			1
as darkness fell , an arc of lights was visible on the horizon			0
" that is @entity178 , @entity68 , " @entity161 said			0
" it 's only about 70 miles away			1
" soon bright flashes of light began to appear off to the right , beyond the @entity183			0
@entity161 and his wife @entity185 seemed to pay no notice			0
what was that , i wanted to know			0
" oh , that , just the @entity159 practicing tank fire in the @entity190 , " @entity161 said			0
one of my most memorable days at @entity2 was a day of tragedy , april 19 , 1995			1
a national desk editor had received a call from a @entity2 affiliate in @entity196			1
the station had heard on a police scanner that an explosion had occurred at the federal building and planned to send a reporter and a microwave truck			0
i called the @entity196 police to find out what was going on			0
i asked if there had been an explosion at the federal building			0
" yes , " the dispatcher told me , " and it 's bad			2
" she slammed down the phone , but with that confirmation i wrote the first bulletin of many i would write that day			2
within the next 10 minutes , the first video of the scene was streaming in -- the mushroom cloud of black smoke , the @entity213 of the building collapsed into the street			0
as the lead writer on the story , it was my job to take that stream of facts , update the story as developments came in , and try to keep the story as coherent as possible			0
at times that day , it felt as if i had grabbed a live wire as the death toll inched toward 168			2
the stories of survivors began to flow in			0
and then there were the questions			0
who did this and why ? about 80 minutes after the blast , @entity238 , the man who would ultimately be convicted of the worst act of homegrown terror in @entity60 history , was arrested in a routine traffic stop in @entity244 , @entity196			2
in 1997 , i would go to @entity245 to cover his trial			0
my worst day at @entity2 was an even worse day of tragedy			1
september 11 , 2001 , when almost 3,000 people died			0
that tuesday morning began routinely			0
an editorial meeting had started on the 6th floor of the @entity251 when word came from the @entity254 bureau that a plane had hit the @entity256			0
like many , i thought it must have been a small private plane and wondered how it got so close			0
then the first video came in from @entity2 affiliate @entity260 with the @entity256 's @entity261 ablaze			1
i sat down and wrote a bulletin			0
my colleague , international desk editor @entity264 , and i were watching a monitor when a plane entered the frame and struck the @entity268			0
did we really see what we just saw ? i wrote another bulletin			0
then , as we tried to understand the magnitude of what had occurred , a third plane , at the @entity275			0
then a fourth plane crashed into a field in @entity279			0
that short span -- between a few minutes before 9 a.m. until just after 10:30 a.m. -- was the longest period of time i have ever experienced			0
the seconds ticked down as if they were made of lead			0
we were under attack , and it would n't stop			0
but , of course , the story was just beginning to unfold			0
very soon , the twin towers would collapse in roiling clouds of smoke and ash			0
a lead writer 's job when a story begins is to give the facts as quickly , clearly and concisely as possible			1
but as the day progresses , it is the writer 's job to pull back , look at the larger picture , include some context , and say , if possible , what this means			1
my final lead that day talked about terrorists striking the twin symbols of @entity60 's financial and military might , the @entity256 and the @entity275			1
the only routine thing about september 11 was at the end of the day when the lead writer who was to replace me tapped me on the shoulder			2
i logged off the computer , stood up and stumbled away -- spent both emotionally and physically in a way i had never been before			0
on the day of @entity55 's last visit to his office in the @entity251 , my old friend and colleague @entity320 , who like me was there on day one , happened to ride the elevator down with @entity55			1
as they crossed the bridge over the food court , @entity323 tried to express to @entity55 what his vision had meant to us , how proud those of us who were there at the beginning had been to be a part of it			1
@entity55 thanked him and headed down the escalator			1
then the mad man turned , threw up his hand , and shouted back to @entity323 , " keep the spirit ! " this week , more than 32 years after i joined @entity2 -- after being a part of thousands of stories , working with thousands of people , and forming friendships that have lasted a lifetime -- i will sign off of my computer for the last time and retire			1
it has been a great career			2
as i leave i am as convinced today as i was early on that there is no better front seat to history than to be a part of @entity2			1
and as i slip down the escalator , i plan to turn back and wave to all the colleagues i 'm leaving behind , confident that the spirit lives on .			2

@entity354 retires this week after a career that goes back to the first day of @entity2
he says the 24 - hour news channel quickly *overcame* doubts that it was needed
@entity354 : @entity55 's *innovation* found an *audience* as events demanded *constant* attention
he says his 32 - year career provided a front row seat to history
