@entity0 , @entity1 -- two dolphins who were rescued from a filthy pool at a @entity1 tourism resort were released back into the wild this week after years in captivity			1
so far , the male dolphins have exceeded their trainers ' expectations : within 48 hours , satellite transmitters showed that @entity13 and @entity14 had traveled more than 100 miles , and they were observed hunting fish as a team and interacting with other wild dolphins			1
" it 's unbelievable to see them travel this hard and fast , " said @entity20 , a @entity22 - based sea mammal expert who oversaw the dolphins ' rehabilitation and preparation for release into the wild			1
" the assumption is they 're going back to the area that they were a pod in			0
they 're definitely on a mission , " @entity20 said			1
@entity20 spoke to @entity2 by telephone from a sailboat in the @entity38 , where he and his team have been tracking the animals ' progress with the help of transmitters attached to the dolphins ' dorsal fins			1
because of bad weather , the team has n't been able to keep direct contact with the dolphins since their release wednesday , although they are still able to track them via satellite			1
@entity20 suspects the dolphins are racing back to the waters around the @entity1 city of @entity56 where they were initially believed to be captured years ago			1
@entity13 and @entity14 are part of an expensive , ambitious and risky program sponsored by the @entity61 - based @entity60 , which is aiming to prove that captive dolphins can be reintroduced to the wild			1
for more than a year , @entity20 and his team worked in a quiet cove on the @entity38 , teaching the two dolphins how to catch their own food			1
he said the intensive training was necessary to get the dolphins ready to fend for themselves			2
" it would be like taking your dog and releasing it into the woods , " @entity20 said			1
" if you do n't prepare your dog for that , it would never happen			0
" when @entity20 first met these dolphins more than a year ago , he said they would eat only if humans placed dead fish directly in their mouths			1
" we had literally thousands of fish in the pen , and they just would n't look at them , " @entity20 said			1
" they had just been so used to being hand - fed in a captive situation that they did not recognize fish as a food source			2
" @entity20 has prior experience with another high - profile release program that ultimately ended in failure			1
he worked in @entity96 more than 10 years ago as part of a multimillion - dollar effort to prepare the killer whale @entity99 from the movie " @entity102 " for release back into the wild			1
less than a year after his release , @entity99 died off the coast of @entity107			1
but @entity20 said he believes @entity13 and @entity14 stand a much better chance of survival			2
" these animals have n't been in captivity as long as @entity99			1
@entity99 was held in captivity for more than 20 years			1
he was held as a solitary animal for many of those years , " @entity20 said			1
@entity13 and @entity14 are each estimated to be around 12 years old , after initially being caught in the @entity38 five or six years ago			1
" they 've probably spent the majority of their life out in the wild , " @entity20 said			1
" because we 're dealing with two males , you can develop competition feeding with them ... they 're ideal candidates for reintroduction back into the wild			2
" @entity13 and @entity14 first attracted the attention of wildlife conservation activists in 2010			0
at the time , they were being kept at a @entity1 resort where tourists paid to swim with the dolphins in a shallow , filthy swimming pool			1
" the pool in @entity135 , @entity1 , where @entity13 and @entity14 had spent the summer months of 2010 had such a high bacterial count ... that it was a significant health hazard to the dolphins and for the unsuspecting tourists who paid to swim with them , " wrote @entity138 , a representative of the @entity60 , in an e-mail to @entity2			1
" the water was filthy with feces and dead fish and a layer of ' sludge ' at the bottom			0
" according to @entity60 , a nonprofit conservation group based in the @entity61 , the dolphins were underweight and listless and would not have survived much longer in the pool , which " having been hastily constructed , was in danger of collapse from subsidence			2
" a coalition of environmental groups successfully campaigned to rescue the animals and transport them in the back of a truck to a sea pen in the @entity38			0
in the final days before their release , @entity20 and his team attached specially designed transmitters to @entity13 and @entity14			1
the tags , which are about the size of a cell phone , broadcast the dolphins ' location via satellite and vhf radio			2
the sponsors of the program admit there is no guarantee of success			0
" there have only been a handful of reintroduction programmes with mixed results , " @entity138 wrote			0
" returning any captive wild animal to the wild is never without risk			2
" one of the few successful cetacean reintroductions on record involved an orphaned female orca named @entity185			0
@entity20 was a member of the team that helped rehabilitate the emaciated animal and eventually reintroduce her to a pod of related killer whales off of @entity192 's @entity191 a decade ago			1
she has reportedly survived and thrived in those waters ever since			0
@entity195 , a marine mammal expert at the @entity196 , predicted major challenges for @entity13 and @entity14			0
" can they break the bond with humans , and can they create a bond with other [ wild ] dolphins ? " he asked , in a phone interview with @entity2			2
" the irony is that if these animals do get released into the wild , it 's a big , bad world out there and they will have to learn how not to get entangled in fishing gear			0
" according to @entity195 , @entity13 and @entity14 's release will have virtually no impact on the world 's wild dolphin population , which faces an onslaught from industrial fishing nets , decimated fish stocks and polluted seas			2
but he and other dolphin experts say successful reintroduction could increase biodiversity awareness in @entity1 and set an important example for the multibillion - dollar captive marine mammal entertainment industry			1
there has been a rapid increase in the number of " dolphinariums " and " swim - with - dolphin " programs cropping up across @entity1 over the last decade			1
" @entity1 , being a very popular and beautiful holiday destination , is sadly responding to the public demand for that ' dolphin experience ' by providing more captive dolphin facilities than anywhere else in @entity234 , " wrote @entity60 's @entity138			2
" conditions in general are very poor			0
" @entity60 did not publicly announce the day of @entity13 and @entity14 's release in order to protect them from curious onlookers			0
on wednesday , after divers peeled away the last barrier separating the dolphins from freedom , the pair initially hesitated			0
" they sat in the pen for 15 to 20 minutes after we opened the gate			0
these guys are cautious animals , " @entity20 said			2
eventually , trainers gave them a hand cue to leave			0
underwater video filmed by scuba divers shows @entity13 slowly turning and leaving the sea pen			0
@entity14 then sped off after him			0
within hours , the born free team photographed @entity14 flipping large local fish called mullet out of the water			0
and then , they witnessed strange behavior from a dolphin rolling on the surface			0
it took some time to identify the animal by its dorsal fin			0
" it was totally completely different dolphin ! " @entity20 said			2
" a single dolphin that was interacting with @entity14			0
within the first four or five hours after we let them out , they were pursuing fish and interacting with wild dolphins			2
it was everything and more than we expected			0
" despite initial encouraging behavior , @entity60 is not yet celebrating			0
" we must remain cautious , " the organization announced on its website			0
" there is still a way to go before we know 100 per cent that @entity13 and @entity14 have readapted fully to life back in the wild			0

two dolphins were returned to the wild , after 5 to 6 years in captivity
trainers are tracking the dolphins , and they are doing well
two years ago , the dolphins were the main attraction at a run - down @entity1 tourist park
lead trainer @entity20 worked to help release @entity99 , the orca from the 1993 movie " @entity102 "
