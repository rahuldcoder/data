-- @entity1 made headlines around the world when he fell 24 miles from near - space to a desert in @entity6 , @entity7 , and lived to tell the tale			1
the jump put @entity1 in the record books and spelled publicity for the sponsor , @entity13 , a caffeinated sugar - y drink building a reputation for risk and adventure			1
now that the stunt is over , does it mean something to the rest of us ? @entity1 risked death			1
why ? was it worth it ? something in the human character must yearn to break into the record books			1
@entity1 did set a record for supersonic travel by a human , 65 years after @entity31 exceeded the speed of sound in an experimental plane			1
one used a rocket engine , the other used gravity ; both went pretty fast			0
but @entity31 was testing experimental planes at higher and higher altitudes and speeds , one of the steps toward getting into space			0
he might have done it for the thrill but there was clearly a higher purpose , namely , the development of flight technologies			0
the @entity13 extravaganza , said several involved with the project , would be useful for developing new and better space suits			0
my guess is that tests in a wind tunnel or a freezer would suffice , and neither would require risking a life			0
the tech behind the @entity61 jump or , astronauts could test suits outside the @entity64 , which is moving roughly 10 times faster than @entity1 , in a much thinner atmosphere about 300 miles above the @entity66 , the real conditions that astronauts might face on a space walk			1
so @entity70 ( or @entity71 ) probably does n't need @entity13 , or @entity1 , whose other work may have been more about research and development and less about testing human limits			1
opinion : the space adventure you ca n't miss @entity70 astronauts have always risked their lives			1
they have to like the thrill , too , but they are motivated by the mission			0
after the @entity84 accident in 2003 , @entity70 limited further space shuttle flights to the essential -- mostly carrying cargo to finish the @entity64			0
anything that was n't vital to the nation was not , decided @entity70 , worth the risk			1
that 's why i remember the debate about repairing the @entity93 one last time , to install two powerful new already - built instruments			2
i heard that the astronauts did n't hesitate for a minute to carry out this mission -- indeed , they argued to add it to the flight manifest			2
the @entity93 science was too important			2
so let 's not confuse a daredevil with a scientist			1
although some scientists take risks , it 's always driven by what is necessary to get an answer to a scientific question			2
as computers become powerful enough to simulate physical reality , even those risks diminish			0
probably computers can help us understand things like , for example , how to make a better space suit			0
as one commentator noted , the @entity13 event was closer to @entity120 than @entity121 or @entity122			0
the @entity123 did risk their lives , as it turned out			0
radiation was more dangerous than they understood , and both suffered from its effects ( although @entity130 died in a traffic accident )			0
but their advancement of physics -- as was ultimately recognized by @entity122 's two @entity135 prizes ( in physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911 ) -- helped usher in the modern age of quantum physics			1
as a physics professor , my reaction to the record - breaking skydive was a bit different than most			2
i started thinking about my physics students			2
@entity31 retraces history in the sky , breaking the sound barrier -- again students of introductory physics can easily calculate @entity1 's fall in the absence of air resistance			1
starting at 128,000 feet , absent the braking due to friction with the air , he would have continued to accelerate all the way to the ground , reaching a final speed of 870 meters per second , or about 1950 mph			2
the fall would have lasted just 90 seconds			0
instead , air resistance slowed him to a reported terminal speed of 833 mph , and the fall lasted nine minutes			2
more importantly , the air meant he could deploy a parachute to slow his descent even more			0
modeling air resistance is a bit more advanced , but it 's still basic physics			1
what else does physics tell us ? @entity1 needed a pressurized suit because the atmosphere is very thin at such high altitudes , as well as very cold			1
if you 've ever taken a long distance flight that shows the airplane 's location and other data , you know that such planes fly at about 35,000 to 40,000 feet , which is about seven miles up , and temperatures are well below freezing			2
add in the wind chill -- since falling through air is the equivalent of standing still in a wind -- and unprotected warm - blooded animals would freeze quickly			0
perhaps a bigger danger was that for the first 35 seconds , @entity1 was tumbling out of control			1
physicists would say he had " acquired some angular momentum " -- i.e. , he was spinning			0
did @entity1 lean forward as he left the capsule , starting the rotation ? in any case , by moving his arms or legs , he could change his orientation , increasing or decreasing his spin -- just as precision divers did in the @entity200 last summer			1
for any jump with a somersault or twist , the diver would initiate a rotation as he leaves the board or platform			2
by then changing shapes ( the technical term is " moment of inertia " ) , he can change the rate of spin			0
students of introductory physics around the world are equipped to analyze this problem			0
watching the replay of @entity1 's stunt on the news , i noticed a room full of technical experts supporting the balloon launch and human cannonball descent			1
these folks had to be well educated in science , technology , engineering and math -- skills essential to the nation 's future			1
skydiving from 24 miles up is thrilling and cool -- but not essential			0
i 'll put my money on the pocket - protector crowd back on the @entity66			0
and hope that stunts do n't crowd out genuine progress in science and engineering			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			1

@entity242 : @entity1 risked death when he skydived , but was it worth it ?
@entity242 : let 's not confuse a daredevil with a scientist
she says physics helped with the dive and tells us a lot about it , like the speed and spin
@entity242 : the jump was thrilling , but stunts should n't crowd out genuine progress in science
