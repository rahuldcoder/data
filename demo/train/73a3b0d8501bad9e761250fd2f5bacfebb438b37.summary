-- it hurts me to say this , but i bet when i say " @entity4 , " you know the last name			1
our world is no longer run by bankers and brokers but by public relations people who will do anything to keep certain names in ( or out ) of the news			1
if they are not trained psychologists , they sure act like them ; they know how to get our interest even when we absolutely do not want to give it			0
and so into this vortex of extreme public relations savvy comes @entity4 , one of the people who is " famous for being famous			1
" how did she do it ? by flaunting her vapid lifestyle , her great body and good looks and her money			0
of course @entity27 idolizes her			0
but as it turns out , not nearly so much as she idolizes herself			0
@entity4 is putting together a big book of selfies called " selfish			1
" she said she was assembling sexy pictures of herself from a trip to @entity33 for a book to give to her newish husband , @entity35 , on @entity36			2
but then the thought occurred to her -- why would n't everyone want one ? normal people would find a 352 - page compilation of selfies in bad taste			1
but in truth we recognize the basic instinct : it 's hard to resist walking by a mirror and not having one of two reactions -- to look or , at all costs , to avoid looking			2
unlike @entity4 , the @entity53 , most of us have a more ambivalent relationship to our own image			1
we look at pictures of ourselves and more often than not , cringe			0
if it 's a flattering picture , we save it for our @entity60 page or give it to our partner			1
but few of us , even few movie stars , want to create books of how glorious we look			0
yes we all are mini-narcissists , but most of us have a sense of our flaws and the limits of how much time we should spend on adoringly looking at our own image			0
@entity4 is a lesson in how extreme it can get when you are a canny self - promoter : you just love yourself so much 24/7			1
if you , like me , is relieved at the disappearance of @entity75 from the front pages and are not a fan of pathological narcissism , you know we should ignore @entity4 and shun falling into her pr trap			1
but the fact that she has an esteemed publisher and that the editors there must think this book will sell well presents a serious issue : why are young women entranced with this woman ? ( i understand why young men would be			1
) but young girls who are easily impressionable and hooked by hype may be enchanted with the ease with which she seems to float through life and take on her " struggles " ( which brand name shall i buy ? which mini-feud will i rage about ? ) as ones they would rather have than the ones they have in real life			2
the fact is that the @entity103 have gained traction in their lives			0
they have built an empire and no one can deny she and her posse have figured out how to make a fortune based on her brand			0
@entity4 wo n't be around forever			1
but is it some failure of feminism among the young that allows this kind of person to be a star ? i remember the icons of my day : @entity121 -- a wild woman , a maverick and a massive talent ( though , sadly an addict as well )			2
there 's @entity126 , a woman who was mission driven			2
and while perhaps she had extra press attention because she was good - looking , it was her feminist theory , her amazing verbal ability and her mentoring of others that made her someone to follow and emulate			2
these were women who deserved to be famous			2
even @entity137 , embellished by @entity138 but not created by it , had ( and has ) talent , and a provocative message about sexuality			0
@entity4 , like @entity75 , is just about as thin as their photographs			1
they want our love and money and they hope to achieve it by showing how much love and money they have already			0
so would n't it be great if @entity4 's selfie book sat moldering in book stores and on @entity157 ? that would reassure me about the soul of modern girls and young women			1
i would n't blame anyone for paging through it			0
it 's a little like a car wreck -- awful , but hard to totally avoid looking at			0
but buying the book is another thing altogether			0
instead of sending @entity4 to the bank , let 's encourage her to go to a really good therapist			1
this kind of narcissism needs to be treated , not celebrated .			0
