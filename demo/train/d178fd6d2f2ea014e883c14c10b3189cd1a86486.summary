-- a day after losing the first presidential debate , president @entity1 and his campaign accused his @entity5 challenger @entity4 of being dishonest about tax policy and other issues			1
" if you want to be president , you owe the @entity13 people the truth , " @entity1 said at a campaign rally thursday in @entity9			2
" so here 's the truth : governor @entity4 can not pay for his $ 5 trillion tax plan without blowing up the deficit or sticking it to the middle class			2
that 's the math. " @entity4 's pledge : no tax cut for the rich the president 's top aides were even more blunt			2
" @entity4 's performance was one that 's probably unprecedented in its dishonesty , " senior adviser @entity26 told reporters			0
still , senior campaign adviser @entity32 acknowledged @entity1 will examine his debate strategy for the next two contests -- on october 16 in @entity35 and october 22 in @entity36			1
the president opted against " serial fact - checking with governor @entity4 , which can be a never - ending , exhausting pursuit , " @entity32 said			0
" obviously , going forward , we 're going to have to look at this , and we 're going to have make some adjustments			0
" what 's next : can @entity1 recover or will @entity4 run up the score ? meanwhile , @entity4 continued to push his debate theme that there 's been much federal spending under @entity1 , complaining of " trickle - down government " that has failed to solve the nation 's economic woes			1
" trickle - down government that the president proposes is one where he will raise taxes on small business , which will kill jobs " he said in an unannounced visit thursday to a conservative conference in @entity53			0
" i instead want to keep taxes down on small business so we can create jobs			0
" he and his vice presidential running mate , @entity62 , then appeared together thursday night in @entity63 , in western @entity64			0
@entity62 touted the @entity66 's endorsement earlier in the day of the @entity5 ticket , adding that he 's looking forward to when " after we elect @entity4 president , i can take my daughter deer hunting			1
" both the @entity72 congressman and @entity4 , who followed him onstage , referenced the previous night 's debate as demonstrating " a clear choice " for voters			1
" last night was an important night for the country , because people got the chance to cut through all the attacks and the counterattacks and all the theatrics associated with the campaign , and instead they were able to listen to substance , " said the former @entity84 governor			0
analysis : five reason the president fumbled the debate " as a result ... , the @entity13 people recognize that ( @entity1 ) and i stand for something very different , " he said , before vowing , " i am going to help the @entity13 people get good jobs and a bright future			2
" his supporters crowed about his debate performance , saying it reshaped a race that @entity4 had appeared in danger of losing			2
sen. @entity103 of @entity104 , who played the role of the president in debate rehearsals for @entity4 , said the @entity5 candidate had a " terrific night " in discussing @entity1 's record , talking about his own policies and setting " the record straight on ... misleading ads. " " he did exactly what he had to do for the undecided voter in @entity104 or around the country , " @entity103 said			1
to @entity117 , a senor adviser to @entity4 , the @entity5 challenger brought focus to the sharp contrast between the candidates by showing voters that " we ca n't afford four more years like the last four years			1
" while both sides were in full spin mode thursday , it was widely felt that @entity4 won the debate itself			1
analysis : @entity4 seizes the story " a week ago , people were saying this was over			0
we 've got a horse race , " said @entity0 senior political analyst @entity131 , who called the debate @entity4 's best so far after the 22 the former @entity84 governor took part in during the @entity5 primary campaign			1
@entity138 , a @entity5 strategist and @entity0 contributor , expressed surprise at @entity4 's strong performance , saying he " rose to the moment " and seemed to benefit from the multiple primary debates			1
" it looked like @entity4 wanted to be there and president @entity1 did n't want to be there , " noted @entity145 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity147			1
" the president did n't bring his @entity153			0
" the @entity0 / @entity155 poll of 430 people who watched the debate showed 67 % thought @entity4 won , compared with 25 % for @entity1			1
@entity1 joked thursday that a different @entity4 appeared at the debate from the conservative candidate who won a grueling primary campaign to challenge him on november 6			1
" when i got on to the stage i met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be @entity4 , " @entity1 said told the crowd of more than 12,000 at a @entity9 park			2
" but it could n't have been @entity4 because the real @entity4 has been running around the country for the last year promising $ 5 trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy			0
the fellow on stage last night said he did n't know anything about that			0
" in @entity9 and later in @entity72 , @entity1 also went after @entity4 's pledge during the debate to cut funding for public broadcasting , referring specifically to the popular @entity178 character @entity177			1
" he 'll get rid of regulations on @entity184 , but he 's going to crack down on @entity178 , " @entity1 joked about @entity4 's pledge to repeal the @entity179 that reforms the financial sector			2
" thank goodness somebody is finally getting tough on @entity177 , " @entity1 added			0
" it 's about time			0
we did n't know that @entity177 was driving the federal deficit			0
" 5 things we learned from the presidential debate during wednesday 's 90 - minute debate , neither presidential candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels , and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date			0
moderator @entity197 of @entity198 had trouble keeping the duo within time limits for responses , especially @entity1 , who ended up speaking four minutes longer than @entity4			2
@entity4 criticized @entity1 's record and depicted the president 's vision as one of big government , while the @entity145 incumbent defended his achievements and challenged his rival 's prescriptions as unworkable			1
but @entity4 came off as the more energized candidate overall by repeatedly attacking @entity1 on red - meat issues for @entity5 such as health care reform and higher taxes , while the president began with lengthy explanations and only later focused more on what his opponent was saying			1
the former governor 's strongest moments came in criticizing @entity1 's record , saying the nation 's high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery showed the president 's policies have n't worked			0
complete coverage of @entity0 fact - checking the candidates " there 's no question in my mind if the president is re-elected , you 'll continue to see a middle - class squeeze , " @entity4 said , adding that another term for @entity1 also will mean the @entity231 , known as @entity232 , " will be fully installed			2
" at another point , he noted how $ 90 billion spent on programs and policies to develop alternative energy sources could have been devoted to hiring teachers or other needs that would bring down unemployment			0
@entity1 argued his policies were working to bring @entity13 back from the financial and economic crisis he inherited , and that @entity4 refused to divulge specifics about his proposed tax plans and replacements for the health care law and @entity184 reform that the @entity5 has pledged to repeal			1
at crossroads of economic crisis , debate disappoints in one of his strongest lines of the night , @entity1 said @entity4 lacked the important leadership quality of being able to say " no " when necessary			1
" i 've got to tell you , governor @entity4 , when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign , has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party , " @entity1 said in reference to his challenger 's swing to the right during the primaries to appeal to the @entity5 's conservative base			1
@entity4 rejected @entity1 's characterization of his tax plan , insisting it wo n't add to the deficit , and criticized the president 's call to allow tax rates on income over $ 250,000 for families and $ 200,000 for individuals to return to higher 1990s rates as a job - snuffing tax hike on small business			2
@entity4 repeatedly went after @entity1 on the health care reform bill , criticizing the president for focusing so strongly on a measure that passed with no @entity5 support instead of devoting more attention to creating jobs			1
" i just do n't know how the president could have come into office , facing 23 million people out of work , rising unemployment , an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table , and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for @entity232 instead of fighting for jobs for the @entity13 people , " @entity4 said			0
" the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care , " @entity4 added , quickly noting his plan would include popular provisions of @entity232 such as allowing children up to age 26 stay on family plans and preventing insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			0
