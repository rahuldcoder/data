" somebody is seeking to get to the @entity3 ambassador , " he continued			2
" since they do n't have any possibility to get to that , they are trying to attack me through my own daughter			1
this is why this is an unethical approach -- and immoral			1
" @entity7 has said she should not have tried to help @entity30 obtain an internship and admission to @entity15 's prestigious @entity33			1
" in retrospect , i realize that this created a conflict and i regret that , " @entity7 said last week in a statement			1
@entity7 said @entity30 contacted her following the reporter 's return from @entity3 to the @entity41 after a december @entity8 interview with @entity3 president @entity43			1
@entity30 had coached @entity43 before the interview on how to describe the violence there , according to e-mails purportedly from @entity3 officials released in february by the hacking group known as @entity50			2
" do n't talk reform , " she wrote in one e-mail			2
" @entity41 's ( sic ) wo n't care , or understand that			2
... @entity41 psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are ' mistakes ' done and now we are ' fixing it			0
' " on her resume , @entity10 said she graduated from college in june 2010 and worked for a year as an account executive at @entity64 , a public relations firm , in @entity65			1
@entity30 said wednesday that she had met a number of @entity68 - speaking journalists during a three - month , unpaid internship she undertook late last year in @entity3 while preparing to return to school to pursue her master 's degree			0
" my main intention as a new graduate was to expose myself to the world of media and communication , which are the fields that i have interest in , " she said in an e-mail to @entity1			0
" unfounded reports published recently have wrongfully claimed that i was the aide of the president of @entity3			2
i want to make clear that i have never served as a president aid ( sic ) to the president of @entity3 , " she continued			0
" she added , " i am nothing but a victim for some personal agendas			0
" @entity30 said that she gained admission to @entity15 based on her own qualifications			0
what is occurring in @entity3 " and to my people saddens me and breaks my heart			0
it is in my prayers that peace and stability will prevail			0
" in e-mails obtained by @entity1 , she struck a personal tone toward the @entity3 president			0

" give me a call whenever u can so i could get some energy from you and tell you how much i misss u ( sic )			0
" @entity7 has said that @entity10 was " looking for a job " when she contacted her			1

" @entity7 sent an e-mail to @entity1 's @entity112 and his executive producer , @entity113 , describing her as a " sensational young woman			1
" @entity1 has said @entity7 contacted " @entity116 " on @entity30 's behalf ; however , she was neither interviewed nor hired as an intern			1
@entity112 himself denied having had any contact with @entity10			1
@entity7 also e-mailed a professor at @entity121 on @entity30 's behalf			2
the professor , former @entity8 executive @entity122 , is the father of @entity113			0
@entity7 later sent a follow - up e-mail to @entity113 , advising him not to bother following up with the college graduate , since she did not have an appropriate @entity41 visa			1
@entity126 , the host of @entity1 's " @entity127 , " said the incident makes @entity7 " seem a little too cozy " with someone close to the @entity3 regime			2
" this looks like a bit of a quid pro quo , " @entity126 said last week			0
" this woman was close to @entity43 , the daughter of the ambassador , helps her arrange the interview , and the next day they 're on e-mail talking about helping her -- @entity7 helping her to either get into an @entity141 school or land a media internship			1

" this is an unethical , immoral , baseless , unfounded , animal and brutal approach , " ambassador says
" they are trying to attack me through my own daughter , " @entity10 says
his comments follow the expression of regret by @entity7 for having tried to help his daughter
