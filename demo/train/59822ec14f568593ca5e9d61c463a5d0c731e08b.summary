@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is that rarest of things -- a conservation park in a city -- and it is now a physical manifestation of the front lines in @entity1 's human - wildlife conflict			1
like the nearby residents of slum housing , the wildlife of the park has become victim of the city 's uncontrollable growth			2
a lack of planning in the capital has led to human encroachment onto the protected area , compromising the well - being of wildlife through an invasion of industrial waste and domestic pollution			1
to secure its future the @entity29 , a charitable trust , and private investors have launched the @entity33			1
it involves the planting of 300,000 indigenous trees in a 30 - kilometer long , 50 - meter wide forest boundary around the park , reinforced by a 32 - kilometer electric fence			1
read this : @entity41 boy scares off lions with flashy invention @entity44 , the senior human settlements officer at @entity1 , says : " the fence is a symbol and a sign , to draw attention to an issue that needs to be much more properly addressed			1
" this issue is what she calls an " ill hunger for land , " the driving force behind the intrusion of urban development onto the park			2
" they ( locals ) see land as a commodity , rather than a resource , " says @entity58 , the habitat program manager at @entity60			0
public space @entity58 and his colleagues categorize the park as public space which is an essential component in healthy social and urban development			2
" public space is a really important part of any urban expansion , " says @entity71 , @entity72 at @entity60			0
" in fact , cities like @entity77 that we think of as really dense actually dedicate 30 % of the land to public space			2
@entity0 is operating at 10 - 15 % which is far too low			2
" not incorporating public space into city planning has created the inevitable challenge of urban growth that does not embrace and accommodate conservation areas			0
@entity88 , professor of @entity89 at the @entity90 , believes that " infiltration into the national park reflects a society that has not accepted wildlife as part of the stakeholders in the development of the city			0
" he adds : " when we plan @entity0 we should view the park as part and parcel of the city , not as an appendage that must be gotten rid of			0
" read this : @entity106 swap spears for bats the value of the @entity3 has yet to charm local residents like @entity113 , a @entity114 grandmother whose makeshift home is only a few miles away from the park			1
she recently received an eviction letter from the town council -- unrelated to the @entity120 project -- and can do nothing but count down the days until she watches her home bulldozed away			0
' i 've been living here since 1972 and my home will soon be demolished but the home of animals is continuously protected ' , she says			0
local support experts believe that this mentality needs to change for @entity0 to move forward			0
@entity132 , the director of the @entity134 at @entity60 , says more participation from locals is crucial for the future			0
" if the city is going to move into a sustainable , healthy , competitive arena then it is important to have urban planning enforcement , but together with all the stakeholders			0
then you do n't need a fence -- they are the fence , they are the ones who would protect it ( the park ) , " she says			1
involving people like @entity113 in planning decisions could help strengthen the sense of public ownership for areas like @entity3			1
and instilling in the minds of locals the importance of preserving the @entity3 could help it be appreciated as an integral component of @entity0 's future development .			1

@entity3 is *threatened* by human encroachment
lack of planning means park has become compromised , say experts
@entity33 will plant 300,000 trees to form 30 - kilometer fence
