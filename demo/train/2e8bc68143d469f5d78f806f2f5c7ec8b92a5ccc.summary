-- sinkholes , like the kind that swallowed part of a resort near @entity5 in central @entity6 this week , are more common than you might think			1
in the late sunday night incident , all the guests inside the buildings at the @entity10 made it out ok before the ground opened up , leaving a 60 - foot - wide , 15 - foot - deep crater			0
but sometimes the results have been deadly			0
in february , a @entity6 man fell into a sinkhole that opened suddenly beneath the bedroom of his suburban @entity20 home			1
here is a look at what causes sinkholes , where they occur and just how dangerous and costly they can be : what causes sinkholes ? many sinkholes form when acidic rainwater dissolves limestone or similar rock beneath the soil , leaving a large void that collapses when it 's no longer able to support the weight of what 's above , whether that be an open field , a road or a house			2
these are called " cover - collapse sinkholes , " and it would appear this is what 's happening in @entity6 , where the ground beneath the home suddenly gave way			2
where do they happen ? sinkholes are particularly common in @entity6 , which rests on a nearly unbroken bed of limestone , according to the @entity54			1
@entity6 is particularly known for sinkholes			2
it 's part of @entity6 's so - called @entity57 , where two - thirds of insurance claims for sinkhole damage occur , according to a report prepared for state lawmakers in 2010			1
other places that frequently see sinkholes include @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 , the @entity63 says			0
do all sinkholes collapse so dramatically ? no , some merely cause the ground above to sag , or result in small ponds or saltwater marshes , the @entity74 says			0
how often do they happen ? there do not appear to be any solid numbers , but the @entity6 @entity81 on @entity82 reported that insurers had received 24,671 claims for sinkhole damage in that state alone between 2006 and 2010			1
that 's an average of nearly 17 claims a day , just in @entity6			2
how dangerous and costly are sinkholes ? deaths and injuries from sinkholes are rare , but certainly not unheard of			0
for instance , in 2012 , a 15 - year - old girl died when her family 's car fell into a @entity98 sinkhole , according to media accounts			0
but the holes are enormously costly			0
insurance claims submitted in @entity6 alone between 2006 and 2010 totaled $ 1.4 billion , according the @entity6 @entity81 report .			1
