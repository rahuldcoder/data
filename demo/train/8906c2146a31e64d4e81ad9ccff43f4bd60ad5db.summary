@entity0 is one of the world 's most respected and accomplished tailors			1
since emigrating from the former @entity4 to @entity5 in 1947 , he has dressed everyone from the @entity7 and @entity8 to presidents @entity9 and @entity10			1
but @entity0 's success follows tremendous adversity			1
as a teenager , he survived two horrific years in concentration camps during the @entity15 , and lost his parents and siblings at the hands of the @entity19			1
in this excerpt from his memoir @entity21 , @entity0 describes how an encounter with an ss guard at @entity25 led him to pick up a needle and thread for the first time , and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes			1
@entity0 : it was our second day inside @entity25			1
the soldiers asked if we knew any trades , like masonry , carpentry , medicine — that kind of thing			1
@entity41 grabbed my wrist and thrust it into the air			1
" he is a mechanic			1
very skilled , " he said			1
above the gates at @entity25 was a sign			1
it read @entity48 ( " work makes you free " )			1
by volunteering my skills as a mechanic , my father protected me			1
it was his way of marking me for the @entity55 as a jew whose skills they could exploit , as one not to be burned			1
as soon as my father offered up my skills , two @entity55 walked toward us to take me away			1
i then did something i should not have done , something stupid : i ran			1
why , i do not know			1
fences and soldiers were everywhere			1
where did i think i was going ? i can not say			1
but for whatever reason , i ran			1
a few paces into my sprint , i heard a barking @entity55 shepherd barreling down on me			1
my arms pumped hard as i stretched my stride and ran faster than i 'd ever run before			1
i snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in			2
he leapt and latched his teeth onto my leg			2
the dog hung from my calf			2
i shoved his head with both hands			2
he snarled and gnashed violently as i struggled to pry him loose			2
the dog 's jaw unlocked , taking a meaty chunk with him			2
blood spurted on my prisoner uniform , the dog 's mouth — everywhere			1
i tried not to cry			2
not in front of my father , not in front of the other men and boys			2
the two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured			2
they then snatched me up off the ground and hauled me away from the group			2
i thought maybe that night i would join my father again , but that did not happen			2
that day , my second inside @entity25 , was the last time i ever saw my father			2
the @entity55 dragged me to the laundry			2
whether they wanted me first to perform a simpler task than mechanical work , or whether this was a punishment for trying to flee , i do not know			2
but after my sprinting stunt , i was eager to show the @entity55 i was a hard worker who could be of use			0
my first job in the camps was washing @entity115 uniforms			1
i knew nothing of the task			0
still , i grabbed a brush and an @entity121 soldier 's shirt and scrubbed hard and fast			0
after working my way about halfway through the pile , it happened			0
i scrubbed so hard the bristles ripped the collar			0
the face of the pacing soldier at my station flushed red			0
i do not remember his words , but i remember his baton			0
he beat me until i bled			0
he needed to make an example out of me for the other prisoners			0
when he was finished with my flogging , he balled up the torn shirt and threw it in my face before huffing off			0
the shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me			0
working in the laundry was a nice man who knew how to sew			0
he gave me a needle and thread and taught me how to sew a simple stitch			0
to this day i still do n't know why , but when i got up the courage , i slipped the soldier 's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform			1
it was a crazy thing to do , because none of the other prisoners had a shirt			0
but i did it anyhow			0
from that day on , the soldiers treated me a little bit better			0
they thought i was somebody — someone who mattered , someone not to be killed			0
the prisoners treated me a little bit better as well			0
you must remember that some of the kapos ( supervisors ) were @entity167 prisoners , but they could be brutal			0
they wanted to please the @entity55 , so some of them would be hard on us so the @entity55 would not punish them			0
sometimes the kapos were harsher than some of the @entity55			0
when i had my soldier shirt on , however , that did not happen			0
when i wore the shirt , the kapos did n't mess with me			0
the shirt means something , i thought			0
and so i wore the shirt			0
in fact , i ripped another one on purpose so i could have two			0
the day i first wore that shirt was the day i learned clothes possess power			0
clothes do n't just " make the man , " they can save the man			0
of course , receiving your first tailoring lesson inside a @entity115 concentration camp was hardly the ideal apprenticeship			1
i would have much preferred to hone my craft on @entity193 or in the mills of @entity195			0
looking back , though , that moment in the camps marked the beginning of the rest of my life			1
strangely enough , two ripped @entity115 shirts helped this @entity167 build @entity5 's most famous and successful custom - suit company			1
@entity203 has a wonderful sense of humor			0
@entity0 's memoir " @entity21 " is available now .			1
