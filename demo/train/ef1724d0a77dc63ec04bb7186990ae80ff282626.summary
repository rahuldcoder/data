-- it 's december 1991 and @entity2 is on the verge of making tennis history			1
the scene is set for @entity6 to lead the nation to @entity9 victory for the first time in 59 years			2
standing in his way is a @entity14 team defending its title -- and more specifically , @entity11			2
some 40 games and many more points later , the @entity2 produces an irresistible serve - and - volley combination that leaves his young opponent -- who would later become one of the greatest tennis players -- failing desperately to return			1
the home crowd in the @entity23 in @entity24 erupts ; forget falls to his feet			0
six decades of waiting is finally over			0
with a crocodile logo sitting atop of his pounding heart , the match - winner was lofted onto his teammates ' shoulders with tears in his eyes , bursting with pride , taking in this historic moment			0
if @entity6 was emotional , so too was an 87 - year - old man who had helped @entity2 to its first @entity9 success back in 1927 -- also against the @entity14 -- and had now finally seen the famous trophy return to his homeland			1
the pride for that man , @entity44 , was twofold			2
not only had he played a role in @entity6 's development , he was also responsible for that distinctive reptile perching on the chest of the history - maker 's shirt			0
" i remember all the letters we got and all the phone calls ( from @entity44 ) when we won the @entity9 in 1991 , " @entity6 told @entity0 's @entity52			1
" beating the @entity14 was very special for us , but for @entity44 as well			2
" so tenacious was @entity44 's style of play on court , building his game from the baseline and keeping his opponents on the move with an array of precise groundstrokes , he earned the nickname " @entity68 " -- the symbol that would later define his fashion empire			1
" he fought like a real crocodile ... and never gave up on his prey , " @entity14 journalist @entity69 wrote in 1923			0
forget adds : " one of his traits on the court was that he 'd never give up , he 'd return every ball back			0
he was unbeatable and that 's how that name came			0
it 's great to identify someone with an animal			0
" @entity44 's major breakthrough came in 1925 , when he won the @entity83 at the age of 20 , before adding the @entity86 title a month later			2
within just four years , he had claimed a total of seven major singles championships on top of three doubles titles , while he was ranked no. 1 in the world in both 1926 and 1927			1
@entity44 was also a member of two @entity9 - winning teams in an era when the competition took on the same prestige as a modern - day soccer @entity98			1
between the two world wars , @entity2 dominated tennis			1
with compatriots @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 , @entity44 helped make up the " @entity105 " -- a group of national icons idolized in their homeland			1
" he was very inspirational , not only to me but to a lot of @entity2 players , " @entity6 says of @entity109			1
so inspirational were the efforts of @entity44 and his peers to their people that the @entity115 was built specially in @entity116 to host @entity2 's maiden defense of the @entity9 in 1928			1
each of the stadium 's four main spectator grandstands were named after one of the quartet , while the winner of today 's @entity83 men 's singles championship is still presented with the " @entity126 " trophy			0
" we built @entity115 for them , they were the reason the stadium was built , so it shows that at that time they were huge stars , " @entity2 tennis journalist @entity127 told @entity0			1
" maybe because they were the first @entity2 team to have success			1
" yet as sport has a cruel way of doing so , a career with its best years still lying ahead , and one that still offered so much more promise , was soon brought to an abrupt end			0
in 1929 , and at the age of just 24 , @entity44 was forced to hang up his racket due to a respiratory disease			2
the @entity116 would have been forgiven for walking away from the game at this point , but his unrelenting passion for tennis , and perhaps the heartache suffered from his premature retirement , drove him on to leave a more far - reaching legacy than just a collection of trophies			1
" he said , ' @entity154 could n't be the future for me , i have to do other things , i have to work			0
' in fact for him it was n't work , it was amusement , " former @entity2 @entity9 captain @entity158 told @entity0			1
an innovator during his playing days , @entity44 had covered the handles of his rackets with surgical tape to make them easier to use , while also designing and creating a tennis ball - pitching machine to help him train			1
as of 1930 , post-retirement , he started mass - producing his invention for the benefit of others , and the " @entity174 " would soon play a part in training players for generations to come			0
" he was all these different persons at once , " @entity6 says			0
" he was an engineer , he was a great champion , he was a visionary man , he always had ways of talking about the future , whether it was rackets , balls , materials , the game			0
" and materials would become @entity44 's next pet project			2
@entity189 up with the heavy , long - sleeved shirts that had long been part of the tennis player 's attire , he designed a more practical , cotton version , with revolutionary short sleeves			1
joining forces with @entity109 , the founder of one of the oldest and biggest hosiery businesses in @entity196 , in 1933 he launched the state - of - the - art polo shirt , complete with a crocodile logo embroidered on it , and so the " @entity109 " brand was born			1
he had been sporting the reptile on his tennis whites since a friend , @entity202 , designed the logo for him the previous decade			0
" he wanted to find something that was lighter , more comfortable , that you could breathe more freely with it , that 's what he did with the shirt , " @entity6 says			0
" he was always trying to find new ways of improving everything			0
" as long as it worked he did n't care about breaking the boundaries of what was conventional			0
" the polo shirt proved a hit , and with it the " @entity109 " brand , as subsequent generations of leading players all donned the cotton number on court			1
he formed a fashion house with his wife @entity222 , who like their daughter @entity223 was a top amateur golfer -- another sport into which the @entity109 logo spread			1
aged 57 , @entity44 was still refusing to rest on his laurels , and had another trick up his sleeve			2
in 1961 , he unveiled the metal tennis racket -- an idea he had been working on for 30 years			0
by using metal instead of wood , the racket would be more resilient , and just as importantly , the ball could be hit with far more power			0
@entity238 , @entity2 's no. 1 player at the time , agreed to try out the racket and debuted it at @entity86 in 1963			1
by 1978 , the @entity240 , as it was known , had helped win 46 grand slam titles and was used by some of the most famous names in the world , including @entity245 and @entity246			2
but @entity44 was n't just an inventor extraordinaire			2
having been a tennis player , too , he took time out to show a great interest in those who handled his creations			2
" @entity44 always had a gentle look on the players who were using his rackets or wearing the shirts , " @entity6 said			1
" he 'd always give you advice and invite you to his house , if he had an idea like a tennis racket			0
" @entity44 's next brainchild was the " @entity262			2
" a racket using the latest in cutting - edge technology , it combined the advantages of small and large beams , while looking rather like a violin or guitar			0
he introduced it to the up - and - coming @entity6 in 1988 , and it would play no small part in his future successes			0
" he was always trying to find new ways of improving the game and having the edge on other players , especially the @entity2 players being able to use them , " @entity6 says			2
in many ways , that historic evening in @entity24 could be seen as the culmination of his life 's work			0
@entity44 died in 1996 , aged 92 , having struggled with health problems -- and @entity2 won the @entity9 again			1
" he would have been proud of what became of tennis in @entity2 , because tennis has grown in the last 50 years , " @entity127 says			1
this weekend the @entity2 team will seek to reach the @entity9 final for the first time since losing the 2010 title match , taking on two - time defending champion the @entity290 at @entity115			1
the current crop of players , led by @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 , are known as " @entity296 " -- though they have a long way to go to match the exploits of " @entity68			0
" they might not all wear his clothes , but the legacy lives on .			0

@entity44 has left a lasting legacy in tennis and fashion
he helped @entity2 to its maiden @entity9 win in 1927 and was a top singles player
after retirement he created the " @entity109 " brand , introducing polo shirts and new rackets
@entity2 will play in the *semifinals* of the @entity9 team competition this weekend
