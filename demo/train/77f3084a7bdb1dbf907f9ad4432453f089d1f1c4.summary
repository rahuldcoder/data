@entity0 -- private health insurance exchanges still are not able to directly enroll consumers in subsidized health plans offered through @entity5 even though the government has said problems doing so should have been cleared up weeks ago			1
executives from three online health exchanges that contract with both insurance companies and government agencies to enroll consumers eligible for federal subsidies in marketplace plans say the process still is n't ready to go and that more work remains			1
this despite several promises from government officials that technical fixes have been made to allow for business to be conducted on those sites , which are alternatives to the troubled @entity24 website and health exchanges sites run by states			1
the direct enrollment process designed by the @entity28 would allow private marketplaces to direct consumers to a federal data hub to confirm their eligibility for government assistance , and then allow them to return to the third - party sites to enroll			1
" we 're not going to launch anything that does n't work , but we ca n't even start testing for a while yet , " said @entity36 ceo @entity35 , weeks after the first round of fixes were announced in mid-november			1
" we 're still going through all of this			0
the stuff we 've had up to this point has been junk , and that 's why i 'm so concerned about this			0
it may not work , " he said			0
officials from the @entity51 , the agency overseeing @entity24 , announced in november several fixes that were supposed to allow for direct enrollment through private issuers within a matter of days			2
after the announcement , consumers should have been able to compare plans on a private exchange , visit @entity24 to receive their subsidy eligibility , and then be directed back to the private site to complete enrollment			2
" we believe more improvements need to be made before it 's stable enough and consumer - friendly enough , " said @entity64 , senior vice president of consumer marketing at @entity65 , another private online health insurance exchange			2
launched in 2010 , @entity70 has been participating in an alternate form of direct enrollment since late november , but visitors to the site still can not complete the entire process online as @entity51 officials promised			1
shoppers can compare plans and get an estimate of what kind of subsidy they may qualify for through the @entity70 system , but in order to officially determine their eligibility and enroll in a plan consumers must call a @entity70 call center			1
" we 're still working with @entity51 on a solution where you do n't have to interact over the phone , " @entity64 said			2
other private exchanges are also using their call centers as a workaround , but one official said companies are still working towards the " holy grail , " when customers can enroll online from start to finish			1
in november , officials at @entity100 told @entity1 they believed they were days away from launching such a process on their site			2
but weeks later , company spokeswoman @entity104 said the direct enrollment process is still not ready for public use even though her company has been in near - daily contact with @entity51			2
" we 're not going to put it in front of the consumer and make noise about it until it 's a great experience , " @entity109 said			0
during congressional testimony on december 11 , @entity28 secretary @entity116 pointed to direct enrollment as a viable option for those who have had trouble enrolling on @entity24 , which experienced enormous problems upon its october 1 launch and was only recently brought up to speed			0
in response to a question from @entity128 @entity127 rep. @entity127 about ways consumers can enroll in insurance outside of the troubled federal website , @entity116 said that private online options were available			1
" i know that the e-surance , e-health brokers have a variety of plans available , " @entity116 said			0
" i ca n't tell you how broad - based that is , but i know a number of companies , you can either sign up in person with an agent or broker or sign up online			1
" the secretary quickly clarified that in order to check whether a consumer is eligible for a premium subsidy , private issuers had to first check in with the federal data hub			0
but when pushed , she assured @entity127 that online exchanges were participating in the process			2
" the e-health insurance folks are now engaged and involved , the brokers involved in that , " @entity116 said			0
" the companies are directly involved , as well as individuals navigating on their own			0
" while some individual insurance companies are currently using direct enrollment to sign up new customers on their company websites , @entity51 officials could not point to any private exchanges successfully using the process the way it was intended			1
through private exchanges , consumers can compare plans offered by multiple providers , filter them by coverage features , and even get free advice as to what kind of coverage they may need			0
insurance company sites only allow consumers to choose from plans offered by that specific company			0
@entity35 said the government is making a mistake by not making it easier for private exchanges like his company to enroll customers , calling the redirect system designed by @entity51 " byzantine			1
" describing himself as a supporter - turned - critic of the @entity5 , @entity35 said at the current pace , he does n't see how the government can reach its projection of 7 million enrollees using just @entity24 and 14 state - run exchanges			1
" there 's absolutely no reason why we should n't be connected directly to the federal data hub , we 've got all kinds of security and requirements built into the regulation , " @entity35 said , referring to the contract his company signed with @entity51			0
" if they want more regulations , more requirements , bring ' em on			0
if they want to audit us every day , come on in			0
" officials from all three companies @entity1 spoke with acknowledged that they stand to make money from a surge in online enrollment , but they all emphasized that the advice and assistance provided by their sites is free to consumers			1
private exchanges get paid by insurance companies for the customers they sign up			2
meaning their service is not only free to consumers , but also to taxpayers .			0
