-- education is under threat , but the @entity3 and the growth of @entity5 are not to blame			1
like the arts and journalism , whose value may be difficult to measure in dollars , higher education has long been understood as a rather " soft " pursuit			1
and this has led people to ask fundamental questions about it : what is learning , really ? and why does it matter unless , of course , it provides a workplace skill or a license to practice ? is the whole notion of a liberal arts education obsolete or perhaps an overpriced invitation to unemployment ? the inability to answer these questions lies at the heart of universities ' failure to compete with new online educational offerings -- the rapidly proliferating @entity5 -- as well as the failure of most web - based schools to provide a valid alternative to the traditional four - year college			1
education is about more than acquiring skills			1
when @entity38 and other industrialized nations created public schools , it was not to make better workers but happier ones			0
the ability to read , write and think was seen as a human right and a perquisite to good citizenship , or at least the surest way to guarantee compliant servitude from the workers of industrial society			1
if even the coal miner could spend some of his time off reading , he stood a chance of living a meaningful life			0
moreover , his ability to read the newspaper allowed him to understand the issues of the day and to vote intelligently			0
what we consider basic knowledge has grown to include science , history , the humanities and economics			0
so , too , has grown the time required to learn it all			0
while the modern college might have begun as a kind of finishing school , a way for the sons of the elite to become cultured and find one another before beginning their own careers , it eventually became an extension of public school 's mandate			1
we go to college to become smarter and more critical thinkers while also gaining skills we might need for the work force			0
accordingly , we all wanted our sons and daughters to go to college until recently			0
the more of us who could afford it , the better we felt we were doing as a society			0
but the price of education has skyrocketed , especially in the tiny segment of elite schools			2
this has led to the widespread misperception that a good college education is available only to those willing to take on six - figure debt			2
worse , in making the calculation about whether college is " worth it , " we tend to measure the cost of a @entity104 education against the market value of the skills acquired			1
did my kid learn how to use @entity109 ? if not , what was the point ? to the rescue come the @entity5 , which offer specific courses , a la carte , to anyone with a credit card ; some even offer courses for free			1
following the model of @entity121 , which began offering a variety of " distance learning " in 1989 , these newer web sites offer video lectures and forums to learn just about anything , in most cases for a few hundred dollars a class			0
moocs have exploded in the past few years , enrolling millions of students and sometimes partnering with major universities			0
for pure knowledge acquisition , it 's hard to argue against such developments , especially in an era that does n't prioritize enrichment for its own sake			1
but it would be a mistake to conclude that online courses fulfill the same role in a person 's life as a college education , just as it would be an error to equate four years of high school with some online study and a @entity148 exam			1
do n't get me wrong : i have always been a fan of online education -- but with a few important caveats			1
first off , subjects tend to be conveyed best in what might be considered their native environments			0
computers might not be the best place to simulate a live philosophy seminar , but they are terrific places to teach people how to use and program computers			2
second , and just as important , computers should not require the humans using them to become more robotic			0
i recently read an account from an online lecturer about how -- unlike in a real classroom -- he had to deliver his online video lectures according to a rigid script , where every action was choreographed			2
to communicate effectively online , he needed to stop thinking and living in the moment			2
that 's not teaching ; it 's animatronics			2
online learning needs to cater to human users			1
a real instructor should not simply dump data on a person , as in a scripted video , but engage with students , consider their responses and offer individualized challenges			0
the good , living teacher probes the way students think and offers counterexamples that open pathways			0
with the benefit of a perfect memory of student 's past responses , a computer lesson should also be able to identify some of these patterns and offer up novel challenges at the right time			1
" how might @entity195 have responded to that suggestion , @entity197 ? " finally , education does not happen in isolation			2
whether it 's philosophy students arguing in a dorm about what @entity204 meant , or fledgling @entity207 programmers inspecting one another 's code , people learn best as part of a cohort			1
the course material is almost secondary to the engagement			0
we go to college for the people			2
likewise , the best of @entity5 should be able to bring together ideal , heterogeneous groupings of students based on their profiles and past performance , and also create ample opportunities for them to engage with one another in the spirit of learning			1
perhaps this spirit of mutual aid is what built the internet in the first place			0
now that this massive collaborative learning project has succeeded , it would be a shame if we used it to take the humanity out of learning altogether			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 : education is under threat , but online computer courses are not to blame
he says education 's value hard to measure ; is it for making money or being engaged ?
he says @entity5 lack human *exchange* with teachers
@entity237 : @entity5 should bring together people to share studies , *maintain* education 's humanity
