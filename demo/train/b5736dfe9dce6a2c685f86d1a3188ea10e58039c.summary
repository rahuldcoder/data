-- beware the " crazy ants			1
" researchers at the @entity3 are warning that the invasive species from @entity5 has the potential to change the ecological balance in the southeastern @entity8 , largely because the ants can wipe out colonies of what 's been widely considered the insect villain of the region , the fire ant			1
the crazy ants , officially called " @entity16 crazy ants , " are omnivores that can take over an area by both killing what 's there and starving out what they do n't kill , said @entity23 , a research associate with the @entity25 invasive species research program at the @entity26 in the @entity27			1
" perhaps the biggest deal is the displacement of the fire ant , which is the 300 - pound gorilla in @entity25 ecosystems these days , " @entity23 said in a press release			0
" the whole system has changed around fire ants			1
things that ca n't tolerate fire ants are gone			1
many that can have flourished			0
new things have come in			0
now we are going to go through and whack the fire ants and put something in its place that has a very different biology			1
there are going to be a lot of changes that come from that			0
" beyond the troubles they cause for the environment , the crazy ants can be a big headache for people because their populations are so dense , @entity23 said			1
the crazy ants nest in walls , crawl spaces , house plants or empty containers in the yard , researchers said			2
" they do n't sting like fire ants do , but aside from that they are much bigger pests , " he said			2
" there are videos on @entity67 of people sweeping out dustpans full of these ants from their bathroom			0
you have to call pest control operators every three or four months just to keep the infestation under control			0
" the crazy ants are going so crazy , in fact , that some people want their fire ants back , @entity23 said			1
" fire ants are in many ways very polite			2
they live in your yard			0
they form mounds and stay there , and they only interact with you if you step on their mound , " he said			0
@entity91 : eat insects , save the world scientists are unsure how far the ants , which are native to @entity97 and @entity98 , may spread in the @entity8 since being first seen in @entity99 in 2002 , they 've been found mostly in wetter environments with mild winters in parts of @entity25 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105			0
and while they can quickly overwhelm a small area , the reproductive members of the species do n't fly , so to move over large distances , they have to hitchhike -- in your stuff			2
" if people living in or visiting invaded areas are careful and check for the crazy ants when moving or going on longer trips , they could have a huge impact on the spread , " @entity23 said			1
