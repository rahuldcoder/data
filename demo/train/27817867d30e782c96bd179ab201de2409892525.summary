-- @entity1 prides itself on promoting a disruptive technology -- electric cars -- but it was @entity1 itself that was disrupted recently as @entity6 said it is illegal , effective april 1 , to operate factory - direct car sales in the state			1
@entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 also ban direct sale of cars to consumers			2
understandably , @entity1 ceo @entity16 was upset and has encouraged people in the @entity6 to go to @entity18 or @entity19 to buy @entity1 cars			1
many wonder whether @entity1 has been out to turn the car - marketing world on its head , do away with the franchised dealership system and change forever the way people in the @entity27 buy cars			1
it can seem that way as @entity1 fights to keep selling its cars direct to its customers , but missed in the speculative fervor is that @entity16 himself has said that as it grows , @entity1 probably would be looking at expanding its presence -- and sales -- through franchised dealerships			1
today , progressive dealerships around the country representing every automaker are creating experiences that make car buying easier and deliver a high level of customer satisfaction			0
@entity16 could cherry - pick dealers who can deliver the experience he wants for his customers , just as @entity49 did when it launched its brand in the @entity27 in 1989			0
selling and servicing cars is an entirely different business from making them			1
using franchised dealerships relieves the car manufacturer of the tremendous capital burden of paying for and staffing brick - and - mortar facilities			2
that 's one reason the auto industry went with that model in the first place			2
besides , car dealerships are important corporate citizens , pumping into the national economy hundreds of millions of sales - tax dollars , tens of millions of dollars in charitable contributions and billions of dollars in paychecks			0
that makes them valuable economically			0
it also gives them clout that few politicians want to challenge			0
more importantly for car buyers and car owners , a national network of franchised dealerships with local sales and service facilities can make buying and caring for a new or used vehicle relatively easy			0
you can see why the idea might ultimately appeal to @entity1			2
@entity1 -- as innovative , different and disruptive as it may be -- is still a small player in a very large arena			2
it sold just under 25,000 cars last year globally			0
@entity87 sold more than that every day			0
if @entity1 has an eye on significant growth , the traditional dealership model , in its most progressive form , is a path the brand should n't ignore			1
today , @entity1 is arguing that it has no existing franchised dealers with which its factory sales compete , and that it is selling something so unique that an entirely different sales model is necessary at the beginning			1
that wo n't always be the case			0
so far , @entity1 's game plan to make its money purely on car sales			1
( electric cars bring in almost no service and maintenance income , which is lifeblood to most car dealers			0
) there also is no bargaining at @entity1 , where the manufacturer 's suggested retail price is the sales price , take it or leave it			1
that works when your customer base is largely a high - income group of " early adopters , " you have no real competition for your $ 70,000 - $ 120,000 vehicles , you do n't take trade - ins and the profit per vehicle allows you to pamper your customers with personalized services			0
that will change in a few years , though , when @entity1 begins selling its planned third - generation electric car , one priced to compete with the likes of @entity129 's @entity128			1
reaching out to the mid-to - upper mass market where there is a lot of competition for the consumer 's attention -- and dollars -- takes a different kind of approach			0
when @entity1 scales to reach that more mainstream audience , turning to a more traditional sales format may indeed be necessary			1
until then , the company has a high - profile battle on its hands			0
the courts , and the market , will decide the merits of @entity1 's arguments			1
even if @entity1 were to prevail on the legal front in every case and win the right to continue selling direct to car shoppers in every state , that decision would hardly override the existing franchise protection laws and the value that locally owned and operated dealerships can bring to the equation			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity6 's new law makes it illegal for @entity1 to sell cars directly to consumers
@entity159 : @entity1 is not about to upend the franchised dealership system
he says as selling and servicing cars is an entirely different business from making them
@entity159 : as @entity1 grows , it will also need to use the traditional dealership model
