@entity0 , @entity1 -- for centuries , @entity4 travelers would tell tales of @entity1 's @entity0 mountain -- of its lush gardens filled with grapes and pomegranate surrounded by otherwise parched desert terrain			1
alas , access to the site was shut off in the 1950s amidst internal strife and tribal rebellion			2
the area remained a tightly controlled military zone for decades after the conflict ended			2
recently , however , all that has started to change			2
the @entity1 government is hoping to make @entity0 ( @entity23 for @entity0 ) a focal point for showcasing tourism in the interior of the country			1
a number of resort brands are already building on this opportunity			1
the 86 - room @entity31 luxury hotel -- part of the wider @entity33 which operates throughout @entity34 and the @entity35 -- is one such company			1
opened in may 2014 , the project is striving to meet the government 's vision of preserving the heritage of the region			1
" the design and the architecture of this particular property was very much to make a very traditional @entity1 house concept using local materials , " says @entity42 , general manager of the @entity31			1
" elements of traditional welcomes will stay			2
we are collaborating with the local farmers to procure the produce and we are getting them involved in the economy			0
the heart and the soul and the character of the hotel are local people from the mountain who guide the guests into their communities , introducing them to the local customs , " @entity42 adds			0
tour guide @entity63 is one of the natives keen to do just that			0
he says part of the appeal of @entity0 is the cooler climate it offers visitors compared to other parts of @entity1			1
" while we have high temperatures in cities around the country , we have really moderate temperature here , " @entity63 says			0
" so the closest place in the region here to escape in 1 or 2 days would be the mountain			0
" the tourism ministry of @entity1 says that the number of tourists to the region has grown by 12 % in the past year alone			1
a similar rise is expected next year			0
and with a burgeoning new industry comes greater opportunity for the 10,000 people who call @entity0 home			1
@entity89 works at the front desk of @entity91 , the only other established hotel on the mountain right now			1
" it is very important for me because if tourism opens for this mountain , it means more jobs will come for the people here			0
" since the hotel opened in 2011 , @entity89 says room occupancy has risen by as much as 20 %			2
next to @entity91 , construction work is underway for two more hotels , including one mammoth project that comes with a $ 50 million price tag			0
such impressive developments are a far cry from the turmoil of yesteryear			0
but a priority for the future of this fertile desert oasis .			0

@entity1 is looking to open up its interior to tourists
a number of luxury resorts have been opened or are in the works near @entity0
*western* resort brands are among those *interested* in investing
