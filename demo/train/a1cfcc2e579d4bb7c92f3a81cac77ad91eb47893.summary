@entity1 -- " we 've seen the movie before , " sen. @entity0 said recently on @entity2 's " @entity4			2
" oh , how right you are , senator			0
when @entity8 's clock radio goes off at 6 a.m. and @entity10 and @entity11 's tune " i 've got you @entity13 " plays in the ' 90s classic " @entity12 , " perhaps the radio should have been tuned into the latest news from @entity1			1
the @entity16 senator was talking about the government shutdown that is being threatened on october 1			1
@entity18 and the president are again at loggerheads on how to move forward as the government 's money runs out at the end of the fiscal year this month and federal agencies are once again warning employees and preparing contingency plans for a closed government			1
all this because @entity30 are making demands in exchange for government funding and @entity34 are saying " no way			1
" " we are committed to changing the status quo in @entity1 and restoring our fiscal stability , " a tea party - backed @entity37 freshman said			2
" at a time when the economy is just beginning to grow , where we 're just starting to see a pickup in employment , the last thing we need is a disruption that 's caused by a government shutdown , " president @entity42 argued			1
while the above two statements could have been made today , the lines were drawn more than two years ago -- in the weeks before the first major battle between newly empowered libertarian - oriented @entity30 and @entity34 that nearly led to a government shutdown			1
@entity37 @entity30 : defund @entity42 care or shut government down again ? seriously ? you are n't dreaming			1
and you are n't starring in " @entity57 " you have heard this before			2
a government shutdown is a possibility and the issues have n't changed : the size and cost of government , the debt limit and health care			1
your guide to a government shutdown some @entity37 @entity30 are threatening to prevent mandatory , annual government spending bills from moving forward if the health care law , also known as @entity71 , is n't defunded			1
it 's a tactic that @entity34 have flatly rejected and even many in the @entity30 , including @entity37 speaker @entity73 , advise against			0
@entity30 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity74 also offered words of caution			0
" [ @entity79 ] epeal - or - bust is much more likely to produce a bust than a repeal , " he wrote in an editorial on @entity2 on monday			0
" more productive is the challenge of reforming @entity71 so that the nation can live with its costs , " he added			0
@entity86 , history professor at @entity87 , entered the debate with an editorial			0
he said the @entity30 's strategy to address the budget through " risky " showdowns " hurts its ability to persuade the public that the @entity30 are interested in seriously pursuing fiscal restraint , as opposed to using this issue for purely partisan purposes			2
" that 's @entity0 's point			0
" republicans ought to understand if we shut down the government , @entity18 always gets blamed -- rightly or wrongly -- @entity18 gets blamed , " @entity0 said monday			1
according to a recent @entity2 / @entity106 , 51 % of respondents would blame republicans in @entity18 if the government closes its doors in october			1
adding to the tension , in mid- to late - october , the debt ceiling is set to be reached			2
it 's a convoluted term that means the @entity114 would have reached its borrowing limit and would be unable to pay bills already incurred -- or default on its loans			0
@entity30 have signaled they want to extract spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt limit			0
@entity42 said he " will not negotiate " on the debt ceiling			0
" @entity18 needs to get it done without triggering another crisis , without shutting down our government , or worse , threatening not to pay this country 's bill [ s ] , " the president said in an economic speech monday			1
" i think we 're facing an extraordinary few weeks of potential turmoil at the least and crisis at the worst , " @entity2 senior political analyst @entity131 said			0
that could be the most oft - repeated political statement of the past few years			0
@entity71 , spending showdown heats up in @entity37 it goes way back -- to april 2011 just five months after @entity30 won a huge majority in the @entity37 , seizing control of half of one branch of government from @entity34 , the first major fiscal fight came to a head			1
" if the government shuts down , it will be the @entity30 ' responsibility , " @entity37 minority whip @entity146 said then			2
" there 's no question that a shutdown is coming , whether we do it today or whether we do it in 20 years , " then - @entity30 rep. @entity30 of @entity149 said at the time , drawing attention to an increase in government spending			1
a last - minute deal -- literally last - minute -- was reached to keep the government open with a short - term spending bill , known as a continuing resolution , until september			2
@entity163 : the lowdown on the shutdown , or why you should care about the @entity167 through the standoff , @entity30 won a $ 38.5 billion reduction in government spending , restricted access to abortions and an extension of the school voucher program in @entity1 , and a vote in the @entity176 to delay the implementation of @entity71			1
the deal effectively started the clock until the next crisis			0
august 2011 : ditching on debt ... " default would cause a financial crisis potentially more severe than the crisis from which we are only now starting to recover , " treasury secretary @entity182 said in a letter to @entity18 in 2011 , warning lawmakers of the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling			1
during that battle , republicans demanded spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the debt ceiling			0
another 11th - hour deal averted default , but the @entity114 credit rating was downgraded anyway			0
the agreement only temporarily shelved the debt ceiling debate , however			2
and it set the stage for a much larger fight down the road			0
while it cut more than $ 900 billion from the budget over 10 years , it also put into place the framework for forced , across - the - board spending cuts known as the sequester			0
@entity18 would have just more than a year to figure out a way to cut an additional $ 1 trillion from the federal budget over the next decade or the automatic spending cuts on both defense and domestic programs would go into place			1
september 2011 : kicking the can ... yep , just one month later , another battle over spending nearly led to a government shutdown -- the third such battle of 2011			1
two years ago , @entity221 spokesman @entity220 said something eerily familiar : " the fever has n't broken , " he told reporters , referring to budget battles in @entity18 that threatened a government shutdown			1
this time the september 2011 threats revolved around the amount of disaster relief funding			2
while @entity34 said @entity30 were " holding hostage " aid to @entity114 hit by natural disasters , @entity231 chairman @entity230 said @entity34 have chosen " to engage in a political stare - down match that will bring us one step closer to a government shutdown			1
" mild by comparison to the previous two fights as it ended days before the deadline , @entity18 reached an agreement that reduced the amount of disaster relief for states			1
december 2012 : walking the edge of the fiscal cliff crisis , debt limit , tax increases , budget cuts , default : common words written ( again ) and spoken ( again ) in @entity1 this past holiday season			0
" hopefully there is still time for an agreement of some kind that saves the taxpayers from a wholly preventable economic crisis , " @entity256 @entity255 said in the lead - up to that fiscal showdown			2
there 's that word again			0
that fight was dubbed the " fiscal cliff			0
" it was the culmination of ad - hoc agreements from previous government shutdown debates since 2011			1
lawmakers worked through @entity273 to reach a deal on tax rates , the debt ceiling and government spending levels			2
while @entity18 agreed to raise the debt limit and raise a series of taxes , including on the wealthiest @entity114 , an agreement on government spending levels was not reached and the forced spending cuts -- the sequester -- went into effect , trimming up to 10 % off non-mandatory federal defense and domestic programs			1
march 2013 : again ? " the full faith and credit of the @entity114 is not a bargaining chip , " the president said in january as @entity1 geared up for another fight over the debt ceiling , spending and @entity71			0
this debate was an extension of the @entity273 " fiscal cliff " battle			0
if @entity18 did n't reach an agreement , the result : you guessed it , government shutdown			1
what resulted was a spending bill that kept the government open until september 30 and also kept deep , across - the - board budget cuts in place that cut $ 85 billion across the board for the remainder of the year - and $ 1 trillion over 10 years - from military and domestic programs			2
and here we are that leads us to today			0
a new day but same story : @entity18 and the president are drawing lines in the sand over the same issues with the same dramatic consequences if they fail to reach an agreement			1
" this country has worked too hard for too long to dig out of a crisis just to see their elected representatives here in @entity1 purposely cause another crisis , " @entity42 said monday on the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis			0
" president @entity42 , @entity330 , will scream and holler that the mean , nasty republicans are threatening to shut down the government , " @entity328 @entity30 sen. @entity30 said on @entity2 in august			2
" and at that point , @entity30 have to do something we have n't done in a long time -- stand up and win the argument			0
" " we 're really seeing the same issues that have divided president @entity42 and the @entity30 @entity37 since january of 2011 , coming back yet again , almost in this kind of circular loop that we 're stuck in of fiscal crises that we ca n't get out of , " @entity131 said			1
now might be a whole new understanding of @entity8 when his character , @entity343 , punches @entity344 in the face after the umpteenth time of having the same , annoying interaction			0
@entity2 's @entity348 contributed to this story			0

talk of a government shutdown is like a scene in the movie " @entity12 "
if @entity18 does n't reach an agreement over government funding , shutdown is october 1
2011 had three major debates that nearly shut down the government
but the 2011 fiscal battles only tell half the story
