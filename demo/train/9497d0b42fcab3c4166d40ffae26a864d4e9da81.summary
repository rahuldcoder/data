imagine you 're a hotel company with a score of brands that seem , well , dated			1
all the flash amenities of yesteryear seem irrelevant today			1
no one is using the minibar , room service is more trouble than it 's worth , and all your young travelers gripe that there 's no free wi - fi			0
what do you do ? answer : you build an entirely new product			0
currently , there is a gap in the market for hotel rooms that fill the needs of the globetrotting generation of millennials			1
that wo n't be the case for much longer , though , as many of the world 's largest hotel chains are gearing up to roll out new hotels aimed exclusively at tomorrow 's travelers			1
next year will see the arrival of @entity29 ( @entity30 ) , @entity31 ( @entity32 ) and @entity33 , plus the expansion of already established hipster brands , like @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , @entity39 and @entity40 ( @entity41 )			1
" every big company is looking at the same statistics we 're seeing and saying , ' wow , we better do something for our millennial segment if we want to stay relevant , ' " says @entity42 , the vice president and global brand manager for @entity44			1
in order to appeal to a segment of traveler that is swiftly on the rise and soon expected to surpass @entity55 in their spending , hotels are having to majorly rethink their strategies and offerings			1
space : redefined and redesigned in previous generations , privacy and personal space were key concepts in the hotel industry			2
as the world gets more social , however , that is decreasingly the case			2
today 's traveler does n't want to sit alone at their desk			2
rather , what they crave is community spaces			0
@entity33 , for instance , has replaced many of the workplace staples found in more traditional rooms with more collaborative furnishings , like a sofa in place of a one - person armchair			2
" young people rarely sit at a desk and work			0
they like to work on their bed , or curl up on a chair , and we 've had to design a room that facilitates that , " says @entity85 , the chief brand officer for @entity86 -- the umbrella company for @entity33			0
@entity94 , meanwhile , has introduced a range of " zones " in their lobby , including a quiet zone -- a @entity101 - style area where groups of people can work independently , though together -- and a video wall where guests can share their photos			0
" this segment does n't want to be confined to one enclosed space , and that 's an idea that 's been adopted by many brands , " explains @entity107 , vice president of equity research in lodging at @entity109			1
tech is king when it comes to satisfying the insatiable techie hunger of today 's traveler , new hotel brands know that wi - fi alone no longer cuts it			1
" if you do n't have high - speed , and if it 's not free , you can forget about this target audience , " says @entity42			2
the standard menu of seemingly endless cable channels also does n't hold the allure it once did			2
" they want to bring their own device , watch their own movies , and listen to their own music , " notes @entity85			0
to address this , @entity33 is looking at ditching in - room televisions in favor of projectors and quality surround sound			0
the product counts even in the budget bracket , customers are expressing their desire for high - quality amenities , particularly when it comes to food , gym and bathroom offerings			0
as a result , the newer brands are rushing to form partnerships with respected brands , both on the global and local scale			0
though considered an economy brand , @entity94 is planning on partnering with cosmetics company rituals for the bathroom amenities , and tails , an award - winning drinks company that makes pre-mixed cocktails			0
" even for a brand in the economy tier , guests expect products they can recognize , not a watered - down shampoo , " explains @entity42			0
the @entity163 effect so what about that elephant in the room ? you know , the king of the " sharing economy " -- @entity163 -- that has lured enough next - gen travelers to potentially put its valuation above @entity38 and the @entity41 ? will @entity173 really give up their loyalty for @entity163 for the likes of @entity94 and @entity31 ? industry experts seem unperturbed			1
" @entity163 is n't really that cheap , " notes @entity42			1
" and is someone who is using the @entity30 hotel brand , and earning points towards their next stay , do they want to go to @entity163 ? i really think they have a bigger effect on service apartments			1

millennials will soon account for half of all *business* *flights*
to cater to this segment , hotel chains are building entirely new brands
@entity196 walls , social media *concierges* and @entity199 keys are newest hotel amenities
some think @entity163 although a notable *upstart* in the market , does n't *threaten* traditional hotel chains
