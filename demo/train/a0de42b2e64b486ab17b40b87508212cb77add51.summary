-- in the sleepy seaside town of @entity2 , northwest @entity3 , a hulking monument to the communist islands ' evolving economy is rapidly taking shape			1
it is here , under the intense glare of the @entity11 sun , that a giant free - trade zone ( @entity13 ) and container port are in the latter stages of construction			1
the deep - water facility will have an annual capacity of up to one million containers when finished ( three times that of @entity22 's existing port roughly 30 miles away ) and 700 meters of berth that it is hoped will host some of the world 's largest cargo ships			2
partially financed by loans from @entity29 and built by @entity29 construction firm , @entity31 , the port will be operated by @entity33 's psa. @entity13 , meanwhile , aims to attract international companies to @entity3 by offering them a low - tax , low - regulation environment in which to manufacture goods			1
" what the zone is intended for is to create a special climate where foreign capital is going to have better conditions than in the rest of the country , " said @entity3 's foreign trade and investment minister , @entity41 , during a september visit to @entity43			1
see also : dawn of the super-ports the $ 900 million project mirrors similar developments and @entity54 that have sprung up in fast - growing communist nations such as @entity56 and @entity57 in recent decades -- although experts doubt whether @entity3 will follow the same path as the " @entity61			1
" while the ruling @entity63 maintains that state control will take precedence , the ambitious development is the latest in a series of controlled reforms that have been made since @entity68 came to power in 2008			2
the government has already relaxed its control over many sectors , encouraging ordinary @entity3 to fill the void with their own private enterprises			2
" @entity3 is shedding its old skin and it 's becoming something else which is like a hybrid of models , " explained senior @entity76 fellow at the @entity77 and author of the book " @entity3 : what everyone needs to know , " @entity85			2
" this will ( likely consist ) of a much larger private sector , a much smaller social sector with the basics of social protection left in place , a lot more personal autonomy and economic freedom for @entity3 people without necessarily moving beyond the single party system , " she added			0
regional developments this new economic direction -- which the administration refers to as an " update " of the socialist economic system -- and in particular the @entity2 development have been brought about by a number of specific challenges and opportunities for @entity3 , @entity85 explained			1
the widening of the @entity108 ( which is due to be completed in 2015 ) means more of the world 's largest ships will soon be passing through the @entity11 , providing @entity3 with the chance to benefit as a transhipment hub thanks to its strategically favorable location			0
fast - growing economies in the region , such as @entity29 , @entity116 and @entity117 , meanwhile , provide fresh possibilities for foreign investment and trade tie - ups			2
nurturing new relationships has been made all the more important given the volatile political climate in @entity123 , whose leftist government currently sells subsidized oil and trades with @entity3 on conditions that are highly favorable to the island country			0
a vitally important cog in this wide - ranging strategy is @entity2			2
according to @entity132 , professor of economics and @entity133 at the @entity134 and author of the book " @entity3 under @entity68 : assessing the @entity140 , " the port and @entity13 are by far the most important development project on the island			1
see also : what happens to goods lost at sea ? " the objective for @entity2 and the free zone is to expand infrastructure , increase exports , reduce imports and develop high - tech projects that will create jobs , " @entity132 said			1
" this is important as the @entity3 government has indicated that anywhere from 1.3 million to 1.8 million workers in the state sector are unneeded and must be dismissed			1
" @entity3 exports are generally raw materials , except for pharmaceutical products and biotechnology products but this is only about 8 % ( of exports )			0
so they want to have value added goods such as computers , appliances and expand biotechnology , " he added			0
breaking with the past whether the wider economic plan and investment in @entity2 will achieve these aims , however , remains far from certain			1
the 51 - year - old @entity170 trade embargo still restricts @entity3 's ability to trade freely with its international partners			1
any ship that docks in @entity3 can not enter the @entity170 for six months			0
if the embargo was ever lifted , however , the @entity13 would be favorably located ( only 120 miles from @entity176 ) to serve as a low - cost site for companies looking to manufacture and ship their products into the @entity170 market			0
as it stands , international investors will have to be persuaded to choose @entity3 over nearby competitors			2
the likes of @entity108 , @entity185 and the @entity186 already have established @entity54 in their territories			0
@entity132 also points to economic development zones introduced under @entity189 in the 1990s and early 2000s which expanded very quickly before " there was a re-centralization of the economy " leading many foreign firms to pull out of @entity3			1
according to @entity196 , a @entity3 specialist at @entity197 , many investors still see @entity3 as a " hostile business environment " and will treat any opening of the economy with a high degree of skepticism			1
" this opening is going to be taken with a pinch of salt ... it 's still to be assessed what the tax and regulatory benefits of the ( @entity13 ) will be , " he said			0
the end of communism ? despite these significant challenges , @entity3 still has much to offer international companies , not least a well - educated labor force -- @entity3 has one of the highest literacy rates of any country , according to data compiled by the @entity216			1
@entity132 however identifies laws that restrict foreign companies hiring @entity3 directly as a potential disincentive to @entity13 investors			0
instead , workers are employed via a government agency that makes all decisions on the wages they receive often driving up the price of labor -- although new laws on foreign investment are expected			0
see also : where are the world 's piracy hotspots ? @entity85 meanwhile points to the lifting of travel restrictions between the @entity170 and @entity3 in recent years and a gradual shift in rhetoric in @entity238 policy circles that indicates a softening on the issue of the embargo			0
all concur however that , despite the tentative adoption of market principles and the loosening of central economic control , this is far from @entity248 of communism in @entity3			0
" ( the @entity3 ) know they need to create these types of clusters where they can operate more aggressive free trade economic policies without necessarily affecting the economic dynamics of ordinary @entity3 , " @entity250 said			2
" it 's pragmatism , " he added			0
" @entity3 is trying to update its structures to meet the new realities of @entity76			0

a new port and free - trade - zone are being built in the @entity3 town of @entity2
the development will cost $ 900 million and aims to attract international investment to @entity3
reforms in @entity3 are opening up the economy and the state is rolling back its influence over many sectors
