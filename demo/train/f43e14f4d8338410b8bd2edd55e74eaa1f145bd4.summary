-- the carnage began early in the afternoon on saturday at @entity3 's @entity2 , with gunshots shattering the calm of a popular weekend meeting spot where @entity7 and expatriates shop for groceries , grab a coffee or catch a movie			2
the ensuing hostage standoff left dozens of people dead and hundreds more wounded			2
two days later , the @entity7 authorities claim to have regained control of the complex , but the stories of those who escaped paint a terrifying picture of how the attack unfolded : @entity21 : caught in parking lot it was about 12:50 p.m. when @entity21 , a @entity25 politician , and a friend pulled into the multilevel parking garage attached to the five - story mall			1
@entity21 , who was at @entity2 for a lunch meeting at the @entity30 , was parking the car when he heard a gunshot , he told the @entity34 television channel			1
his first thought : it 's a robbery			2
then came the rapid gunfire			2
he said he got out of the car and hid near the main entrance of the parking lot			2
that 's when he saw some of the attackers -- four men wearing checked head scarves and carrying " very long rifles			1
" they did n't cover their faces , he said			1
he could hear them but could n't understand them			1
" it sounded like a variation of @entity54 , " he said			2
then they turned their guns in @entity21 's direction , taking aim at a security guard hiding near him			1
" he was shot in the head , and he died instantly , " he said			1
then they fired at him , aiming for his head			1
a bullet grazed him in the head , he said			1
he also suffered a gunshot wound to the leg			2
the gunmen then calmly turned and walked into the mall , @entity21 said			1
by all accounts , more gunmen were making their way into the mall through other entrances			1
not seeing the attackers was part of the terror @entity75 : refuge in a store it was shortly after noon when @entity80 of @entity81 , @entity82 , made her way into the mall to have lunch with a friend when the attack began , she told @entity0 affiliate @entity88 via @entity90			1
@entity80 , who moved to @entity3 in july to work with a financial company , was in the middle of lunch on the mall 's terrace when the gunmen stormed the area , throwing what she believes were hand grenades and firing assault rifles			1
" we stood up and started to turn , and we heard machine guns			1
then , we started to run and there was a second explosion , which knocked us on the ground , " @entity80 told @entity88			1
@entity80 and her friend got up and ran to a store where dozens of people had taken refuge			1
once inside , the store manager pulled down a metal gate at the store 's entrance to try to prevent the gunmen from coming in , she said			1
but it did n't block out the sounds of the gunmen			1
" while we were back there , you could hear them methodically going from store to store , talking to people and asking questions , " @entity80 said			1
" they were shooting , screaming			2
then it would stop for a while and they would go to another store			1
" four hours later , @entity80 and her friend were rescued by security forces			1
@entity80 believes she was " completely lucky " because she was on the ground floor when the assault began and where she was hiding was easily accessible to her rescuers			1

" i thought actually , it was a car accident , i thought someone had been rear - ended			0
then i saw people running and my colleague , who worked elsewhere , recognized the sound of gunshots and she yelled at me and we and other people in the parking garage began crawling underneath cars and behind cars and we heard more shots so we began running			2
" @entity248 , her colleague and their driver followed several other people into the stairwell of the garage			0
" we had gone down into the parking garage so i thought when i entered the stairwell that i would just go up one level and i would be able to exit -- and that was not the case , " she said			0
" there were two people in the stairwell with me who were superficially wounded from gunshots			0
when we initially entered the stairwell we kept going up and then we heard shots above us so we ended up staying there for about an hour and a half			2
" the door to the supermarket then reopened , the lights came on and people began exiting , she said			0
" i was very , very hesitant because there was no information to tell me that it was safe to exit			0
it was just that the people in front of me were exiting , @entity248 said			0
