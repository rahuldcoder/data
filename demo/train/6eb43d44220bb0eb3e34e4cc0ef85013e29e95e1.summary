-- he 's football 's chief sinner , and @entity4 's alleged attempt to bite @entity6 's shoulder in a key @entity8 game has prompted an outpouring of indignation from the game 's global congregation			1
while many sought to condemn a man who is embroiled in the third biting controversy of his career , some observers felt compassion for the under - fire star			1
" i actually feel sympathy for him , " said @entity22 , football psychology expert and author of " @entity24			1
" " he 's one of the world 's best players and he obviously has a problem , " he told @entity0			2
" that problem comes up at the wrong time , in the wrong place and he has to learn how to manage it , but that 's tough to do			2
" @entity4 has incisor history on the football pitch			1
when playing with @entity36 club @entity35 in 2007 he was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent , while he was hit with a 10 - match sanction for an identical offense while playing for @entity41 in april 2013			1
his short fuse , according to @entity22 , is part of a negative response to frustration which he has likely been dealing with for most of his life			2
this is a player who at the age of 16 was given a red card for headbutting a referee			0
" it 's an instinctive response to frustration , " explained @entity22			1
" rationally , it 's something that you would think that he could manage and deal with , but that 's not how we work as human beings			0
it 's something that he has to deal with and manage for the rest of his playing days			0
" one criticism of @entity4 is that his past indiscretions suggest he might be irredeemably unreformable			2
his misdemeanor in @entity66 the latest in a long line of unsavory incidents which includes serving an eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity71 's @entity70 in 2011			2
but @entity22 insists it 's too simplistic to say @entity4 is a millionaire sports star who should know better			1
have your say on @entity4 ! @entity0 's @entity75 " that 's not the way we as human beings or the brain works , " argues @entity22 , who points to the fact that many people have certain behavioral habits they would rather not broadcast to the public			1
" the fact that he 's high profile means absolutely nothing			0
it 's like saying that somebody who is rich should never get depressed , it 's like saying somebody who is famous should never lose their rag			0
fame does n't inoculate your brain from life 's stresses and strains			0
" we 're all subject to road rage , for instance , and that 's essentially what it is			0
it 's a form of road rage			0
" the key to cracking @entity41 striker @entity4 's tendency to bite opposition players could lie on the training field -- a place where @entity22 believes the @entity114 could benefit from some tough love " i think the solution is actually quite simple , " he said			1
" at his home club , whether that remains @entity41 , if it 's ( @entity41 manager ) @entity117 and his coaching staff , what you need to do is help @entity4 experience frustration and experience a different reaction and response			1
" a practical working example could be playing a small - sided game with @entity117 engineering a situation where @entity4 would get frustrated			1
" for example putting two or three @entity41 players on him and probably being overly aggressive , fouling him and making sure that when @entity4 goes to react , he reacts with a different response			2
" put him under that stress and strain in every training session			0
make him react and respond and then change his response from maladaptive to adaptive , so you are n't biting somebody , you 're just carrying on with the game			2
" whether @entity4 will be able to carry on at this @entity8 is a matter of debate			1
@entity147 's win on tuesday earned it a place in the second round and a tie with @entity151 , but football 's global governing body @entity152 has opened disciplinary proceedings over the biting incident which could end @entity4 's involvement in the tournament			1
@entity22 agrees that @entity4 should be punished , but his overriding observation is that empathy should be shown to someone who is battling a deeply - ingrained problem			1
" i just think it 's an enormous challenge for him to help himself , " he said			0
" i know how tough change can be and how tough managing yourself can be			0
" i would imagine that 99.9 % of the population are absolutely s * * t at managing their mindset on a day - to - day basis			0
" the fact is that sport is offered up to the media 's glare			0
the world is watching you , i actually feel sympathy for him			0
