-- the @entity1 are not playing in this year 's @entity2			0
so why was a guy sitting behind home plate at @entity5 , home of the @entity6 , in a bright orange @entity1 jersey at @entity8 1 and 2 ? that mystery man is @entity10			1
and he loves watching sports in person and up close			0
@entity10 , 58 , is a compensation lawyer who lives in @entity16			1
he is n't married and does n't have any children , giving him extra disposable income to attend high - profile sporting events in high - profile seats			1
he told @entity0 he 's been to 27 @entity21 , and he recently told the @entity22 that he has been to more than 200 @entity24 playoff games and at least 85 @entity2 games			2
the event that triggered @entity10 to start attending so many games was a breakup			1
he says he was in a relationship with a woman who did n't like sporting events			1
" so when i stopped seeing her , i decided i 'm going to start going to stuff i 'm watching on tv			0
that was about 15 years ago , and i 've been doing it ever since			1
" he is a @entity1 season ticket holder , with two seats -- you guessed it -- behind home plate at @entity41			2
he also has four tickets in the first row by first base			0
he says gives those away to his employees or strangers before games			2
if you 've been watching the @entity2 , you could n't help but see @entity10 among the sea of blue in @entity5 in @entity51			1
his presence in orange caused buzz online and on social media			1
" nobody ever noticed me when i used to wear like a @entity58 hat or a @entity60 jersey or anything like that , and i used to wear @entity1 teal , " @entity10 said			1
" but in 2012 , when i went to the @entity2 for the @entity66 game , people noticed me wearing an orange @entity1 jersey behind the @entity66 bench , and that 's kind of how the whole thing started with people knowing who i am and what i did			2
" but it 's different this time			0
more people have noticed him			0
his recent fame has caused a spike in his followers on @entity79			0
his handle , @ @entity81 , has jumped from roughly 175 followers to more than 6,700 in the last three days			0
on thursday , @entity10 said he knew he was in for a ride when he saw himself on the front page of wednesday 's @entity85			2
so why is he getting noticed by so many now ? @entity10 said he thinks things got big because of the color contrast with the @entity6 blue			2
wearing an orange @entity1 jersey that looks like it could glow in the dark did n't go over well in @entity51			1
@entity10 said the @entity6 asked him to move or change clothes , and he refused			2
the @entity6 did n't immediately respond to @entity0 's request for comment , though the club has denied this happened , according to other reports			0
" it 's a wonderful experience , and i 've decided i want to keep doing this , so i am going to keep doing it , " @entity10 said			1
" i 've been asked a lot recently , ' are you going to keep doing this ? ' and i said , ' why not ? ' so i 'm doing this			0
" @entity10 will be in @entity104 for game 3 on friday , although he may not be as easy to spot among the @entity66 ' faithful wearing orange			1
but keep an eye out for him			0
he 'll be in the second row , on the aisle , behind the catcher			0
