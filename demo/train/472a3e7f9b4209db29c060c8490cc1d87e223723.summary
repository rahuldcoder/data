-- nothing better sums up @entity3 's extraordinary mixture of challenges and opportunities than agriculture			1
on the one hand , @entity3 is home to one in four of the world 's hungry and is the only continent which fails to grow enough food to meet its own needs			2
yet it has also half of the world 's unused land suitable for farming			2
better still , increasing yields on existing farmland by 50 % -- still far below the global average -- would not only meet @entity3 's own food requirements but provide a sizable surplus for export			2
with global food supply needing to increase by an estimated 70 % by 2050 , the continent is at the heart of the challenge of food security			1
all this explains why agriculture in @entity3 is finally getting the attention it deserves from both the continent 's governments and donors			2
the recent nutrition for @entity35 generated pledges of $ 4.1 billion to fight malnutrition and hunger			0
this builds on the commitments made at @entity41 12 months ago when we , along with other local and multinational companies , committed to collectively invest over $ 3 billion across the agricultural value chain in @entity3 countries			2
there is now increased pressure on @entity49 leaders , meeting this week in the @entity50 , to tackle the issues at the heart of food insecurity , including " land grabs			1
" read this : @entity57 land grabs , mirage in the desert in the worst cases , local communities and farmers have been evicted from land they long regarded as their own			1
farmland which was once productive can be left idle			0
plans to grow crops for export in the future can also be difficult to stomach when local people do n't have food to eat today			0
land purchases which ignore the interests of local communities and the local landscapes are both morally wrong and commercially short - sighted			2
we need action both nationally and globally to stop them			2
but there is a danger that these clear - cut cases fuel opposition to all outside investment or create a false choice between large - scale commercial farming and smallholders			1
the truth is @entity3 desperately needs to maximize the potential of both to meet the needs of its citizens			2
with smallholder farmers still producing 80 % of the food and supporting 65 % of the population of @entity96 , they are central to any successful sustainable solution			0
we need to lift the barriers which have seen them locked out of the developments in agriculture from which farmers around the world have long benefited			0
where this has happened , the results can be remarkable			0
read this : @entity3 can feed itself in a generation as a company , we have been working with @entity57 farmers for many years			0
we buy our raw materials from all sorts of farming systems , from large - scale commercial barley farmers right through to near - subsistence cassava farmers who we are keen to help become viable commercial operators -- and at least half of the grains we use come from local farmers			1
the challenge for all who want to see @entity57 agriculture drive prosperity for its people is to maximize the benefits which both smallholder and large - scale commercial farming can bring			1
there is no single answer to preventing land grabs but at the heart of any solution is the need to improve land rights			1
it is no coincidence that many of the most questionable acquisitions have taken place in countries with the weakest system of land rights in place			1
as much as 90 % of the land in @entity96 is untitled			0
the result is that communities which may have lived and farmed the land for many generations have no enforceable legal claim to it			0
in the worst cases , this can allow land to be sold off by governments from under their feet without any hope of compensation			0
read this : land grabs really water grabs ? improved land rights which go at least some way to recognize history and usage would help prevent this from happening			1
nor is it impossible to put in place			0
countries such as @entity165 and @entity166 have already improved their laws so customarily held lands have the force of private property			0
giving people the protection of legally enforceable land rights does not only give them security			1
it also gives them greater incentive to invest in their farms and an easier route to get this investment			0
the lack of legal paperwork to their land remains a major reason for the refusal of banks to lend to farmers			0
improving land rights would also help commercial organizations who want to invest and farm in a responsible way			1
the present position gives us the worst of all worlds			0
while bad investors can get away with riding roughshod over the rights of smallholders and communities , the present free - for - all makes it difficult for good investors who want to farm in a way which is beneficial to local people and the environment from accessing land			1
it is not just weak land rights which are holding back @entity57 agriculture , and the solutions are complex and multi-faceted			1
but work to put in place a fair and enforceable system would be a major step to helping the continent fulfill its rich potential			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are those of @entity219 .			0

@entity49 leaders under pressure to tackle food security , says @entity219
@entity226 and international action is needed to stop land grabs , he says
but @entity3 needs both large - scale commercial farming and smallholders , he adds
@entity219 calls for " a fair and enforceable system " of land rights
