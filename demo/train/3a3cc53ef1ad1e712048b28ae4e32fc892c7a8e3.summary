@entity0 -- with @entity4 leaving communities under water , stranding millions without power and consuming public resources in several states , could next tuesday 's vote for president be moved to a later date ? @entity4 leaves election officials scrambling no , it ca n't			0
without passage of a new federal law , voting for president is required to take place on tuesday , november 6 , as planned			1
but , partial postponements of voting in some affected areas are possible , consistent with the laws governing the election of the president and vice president			1
here 's why : when people go to the polls on @entity26 , they are n't voting directly for their choice for president or vice president			2
instead , they are voting to select representatives -- or " electors " -- to the @entity32 , the body that actually determines who will be president and vice president			0
candidates , voters forced to navigate @entity4 the @entity38 gives @entity39 the authority to determine " time " of choosing those electors			2
in 1845 , @entity39 passed a law that set the tuesday immediately following the first monday in november of every election year as @entity26 across the country			1
the same law also gives states some leeway in picking electors to the @entity32			0
but to exercise that leeway , a state must have " held an election for the purpose of choosing electors , " and " failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law			0
" when that happens , the law says " the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such manner as the legislature of such state may direct			0
" @entity4 's impact : state by state based on this , the @entity65 , a federal agency that provides legislative research support to @entity39 , concluded in a 2004 report that a state could probably hold presidential voting on @entity26 in places unaffected by a natural disaster but postpone it until a later date in affected areas without violating federal law so long as the state met other legal requirements relating to electing the president and vice president			1
but the law passed by @entity39 setting @entity26 only allows a state to pick its electors on a later date if it has already held an election on @entity26 and " failed to make a choice " on that day			1
so a complete statewide postponement would arguably violate the 1845 law , the 2004 report suggested			2
but the report also pointed out that the @entity89 has emphasized the role states play in selecting the presidential electors , so a state might be allowed to postpone an entire statewide vote for president in emergency circumstances like a hurricane or other natural disaster			1
@entity1 senior correspondent @entity98 contributed to this report .			0

@entity100 is set by @entity39 under its authority in the @entity38
@entity26 can only be *changed* if a new federal law is passed
but a state will probably be allowed to postpone voting only in disaster - affected areas
statewide postponement of the presidential vote is an open legal *question*
