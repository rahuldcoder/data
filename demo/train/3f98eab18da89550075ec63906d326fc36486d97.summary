-- @entity1 and @entity2 remain on course to face each other in the final of the @entity6 after both claimed semifinal first leg victories on wednesday			1
@entity9 scored the only goal of a tempestuous match to give @entity1 a narrow 1 - 0 victory at holders @entity13 in the first leg of their semifinal			1
meanwhile , a devastating first - half display set @entity2 on their way to a 5 - 0 home win over @entity20 , leaving the second leg looking like a formality			1
@entity9 , whose place in the @entity1 side is under threat following the loan signing of @entity28 striker @entity27 , settled the contest at the @entity31 stadium in the 15th minute , dribbling past one defender before cutting inside and curling home a left - foot shot			1
however , the home side were adamant they had levelled on the stroke of half - time when @entity38 rounded goalkeeper @entity39 , only for @entity40 to clear the ball off the line			2
@entity13 players crowded the referee and his assistant claiming the ball had cross the line , but the officials waved away their protests and tv replays proved inconclusive			2
both sides had chances to score after the break , notably real when @entity54 and @entity55 combined to somehow miss from close range			0
the match finished amid ugly scenes with @entity39 holding his head after being struck from a missile thrown from the crowd			0
the result proved a timely present for @entity1 coach @entity64 on his 48th birthday and also edged the club closer to the final of a competition they last won in 1993			0
should @entity1 avoid defeat in the second leg at the @entity73 , they will almost certainly face old rivals @entity2 for the first time in a final since 1990			1
two goalkeeping errors handed @entity78 and @entity79 early goals in the first half to give @entity2 a perfect start and some more @entity78 magic made it 3 - 0 by just the 16th minute			1
@entity85 headed home a @entity88 free - kick in the 31st - minute for their fourth goal and a flowing move resulted in @entity92 adding a fifth with just two minutes remaining			0
elsewhere , @entity95 leaders @entity96 are through to the semifinals of the @entity98 after a 2 - 1 victory at @entity100			1
two goals from @entity103 @entity102 earned victory for the visitors , and ensured @entity96 striker @entity106 made a winning return to @entity108 , less than a month after being effectively sacked by @entity100 after falling out with the club 's president			2
@entity102 struck twice in the space of five first - half minutes , both times being set - up by new @entity115 signing @entity113			0
the home side pulled a goal back early in the second half when @entity119 netted on his debut following his move from @entity122 , but @entity96 held on to reach the last four of the competition			2
@entity96 were joined in the last four by holders and city rivals @entity126 , who beat @entity128 5 - 4 on penalties , after 90 minutes and extra time went by without either side scoring a goal			1
@entity122 secured their place in the last four on tuesday , also going through on penalties against @entity135 , while @entity136 and @entity137 will face each other on thursday for the final remaining place			0
the semifinal line - up for the @entity141 has also now been decided following wednesday 's remaining last eight matches			0
@entity143 scored twice as holders @entity144 cruised to a 4 - 0 victory at second division side @entity147			2
however , there were shocks in the two other matches on wednesday with second division @entity152 and @entity153 putting out @entity156 sides @entity154 and @entity157			0
@entity158 sealed their place in the semifinals with a 3 - 2 extra time victory over @entity162 on tuesday .			0

@entity1 win 1 - 0 at holders @entity13 in their @entity6 semifinal first leg
@entity9 scores the only goal to give @entity1 a *crucial* *advantage*
@entity2 thrash @entity20 5 - 0 in the other semifinal , scoring four goals in first half
city rivals @entity96 and holders @entity126 both through to the @entity98 semifinals
