if your smartphone is attached to your hip , your blood flows like a @entity6 feed and you 're fairly certain your eyes permanently see through an @entity10 filter , then maybe it 's time to disconnect for a bit ? a new summer camp aims to help adults take a break from technology for a weekend of being a kid again			1
" @entity21 grounded , " a retreat brought to you by the folks at the @entity25 , takes place this june near @entity18 , @entity19 ( about two to three hours north of @entity20 )			1
this four - day " summer camp for adults " in a 1970s - style boy scouts camp atmosphere brings together 232 campers who must follow some special rules : no technology use , no cell phones allowed and no talking about work			1
" we really hope people reconnect with themselves , " said @entity34 , a partner at the @entity25			0
" so many people now do n't understand their relationship with technology , but they do know something 's wrong with how often they feel the need to check their phone			1
" campers get to stay in open - faced cabins , eat in a dining hall and can participate in tech - free activities including archery , capture the flag , arts & crafts workshops , pillow fights and yoga			1
" part of what we want to do is give people this ability to kind of dive deep into something that they have n't really done , " @entity52 told @entity53			0
compared to camp for kids , sneaking out at night is actually encouraged at @entity60 grounded			1
@entity52 said campers can wander through the woods to discover a " magical nightlife			0
" " you never really know what you 're going to come across , " he said			0
" it might be a jazz quartet inside of a dancing school bus ... we 're going to have a bunch of bonfires and musicians up there and stuff as well			0
" it is a drug - and alcohol - free event , and the camp will have medical personnel and a camp phone on site for emergencies			2

but at camp , everyone will use nicknames and attendees ca n't ask each other their ages , so everyone is really " just another camper , " @entity52 said			2
though there is currently a waitlist , they plan to hold another session in the future , since demand has been so high			0
@entity52 , a former tech industry whiz himself ( he has worked at @entity107 ) , said @entity108 regularly holds other monthly device - free retreats , as well as device - free events that have a " phone check " ( like a coat check )			2
but with @entity21 grounded , it 's the largest retreat they 've done so far , according to @entity52			2
" when you were a kid , your life was not dominated by the technology that it is now , " he said			0
" we want to take people back to that easy state of living where their only concern is ' what 's the next activity that i 'm going to right now and what 's going to be the next fun thing ? ' " could you survive a tech - free weekend on a " digital detox ? " or would it be too difficult for you to disconnect ? share your thoughts on this concept in the comments			1
