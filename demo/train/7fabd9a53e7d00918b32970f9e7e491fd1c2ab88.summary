-- it was to be a somber memorial , a remembrance of those who perished in a lethal milky fog			0
to mark the 25th anniversary of the world 's worst industrial disaster , authorities planned to open up the now - dilapidated shell of the @entity12 fertilizer plant , where in the wee hours of december 3 , 1984 , 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas oozed out onto the sleeping city of @entity15 , @entity16			1
about 4,000 people died instantly in the toxic leak , an event that came to be marked each year with disputes over victims ' rights and government accountability			1
on this year 's milestone anniversary , a new controversy has stirred			0
the state government of @entity27 planned to temporarily open the long - silent plant -- surrounded by concrete barriers and barbed wire -- to the public			1
it was to be part of a series of events observing the tragedy			0
because everyone wanted to see , to know			0
for the same reason that a person visits a @entity41 concentration camp or ground zero in @entity43			0
" everyone wants to see the world 's worst industrial disaster , " said @entity44 , the secretary for the @entity45 for the @entity15 gas tragedy			1
it was going to be the government 's way of reassuring its people that the plant no longer posed a threat to society			1
but the move sparked protests from victim rights groups and environmental activists			0
just days before the anniversary , government officials backed away from the plan they had recently announced			1
the official reason , however , had little to do with the gas leak			0
@entity44 cited an election rule currently in force that prohibits acts that could be construed as attempting to influence voters ahead of the polls			2
@entity15 's municipal elections are scheduled for december			1
the plant could still be opened at a later date			2
though officials representing the government of the state of @entity27 maintained the @entity12 plant is perfectly safe , their plans drew criticism			1
activists who advocate for @entity15 's victims viewed the plant tours as a publicity stunt for the government			1
it was another way to shirk responsibility , said @entity88 , an activist with the @entity89 , a coalition of agencies that advocates for victims			1
" they knew about the elections a month ago , " @entity88 said , noting that on the 25th anniversary the government wanted to divert attention from the real issues			2
thousands of people still suffer from exposure to the deadly gas and from land and water that became contaminated			2
activists contend that neither @entity12 nor the @entity16 government has done enough to help survivors			0
in the years since the poison cloud enclosed @entity15 , thousands more have died of contamination - related illnesses			2
the @entity109 in @entity15 alleges that survivors have received an average of only $ 500 each in compensation			2
those who are drinking contaminated water or children who were born with birth defects have not received any money , the coalition said			0
@entity12 , which was bought by @entity119 in 1999 , has said it has no liability left in the disaster after it paid the @entity16 government a $ 470 million out - of - court settlement in 1989			0
the company has said it believes the leak was an act of sabotage			0
@entity88 said plans to open the plant to the public was disrespectful to @entity15 's gas victims			1
the government , she said , was eager to showcase the city as a shining example of recovery .			0

state had planned to temporarily open the plant to the public
officials : plan scrapped *due* to rule about influencing elections
victims ' advocates say plan was publicity stunt
