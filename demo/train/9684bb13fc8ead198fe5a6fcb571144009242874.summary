@entity1 attorneys general in several states say they are weighing legal challenges to president @entity5 's overhaul of immigration rules			1
the man who rose to conservative stardom as the first attorney general to challenge @entity5 's health care law in court , @entity13 's @entity12 , said they 're in a " powerful position to make the legal assault			1
" but , he said , because @entity5 's immigration move was an executive order rather than a bill that worked its way through @entity21 , attorneys general have less time to prepare their moves than he did in 2010			1
" the best thing to do there is just to take it slow , " @entity12 , who now helms the @entity24 , said friday			2
" one of the challenges for lawyers can be explaining first of all , what the legal issue is , and second , its significance			0
and both of those are important			0
" " this should n't be done as a political undertaking , it should be done as a legal undertaking , " he said			0
" as long as they keep that focus , understanding they have to communicate to people who are n't lawyers what they 're doing and why , i think they 'll be just fine			2
" @entity47 could play the lead role in challenging @entity5 's executive order easing deportation for the undocumented parents of children born in the @entity53 and others			1
the state 's @entity1 attorney general , @entity55 , who 's just weeks away from replacing outgoing gov. @entity57 , said wednesday night that he 's planning to sue			1
in @entity59 , attorney general @entity58 promised a lawsuit			2
@entity1 hammer legal case against @entity5 other elected officials also are considering challenges , as well			1
@entity65 gov. @entity64 said his state will take " any available legal actions necessary			0
" at a @entity75 meeting this week , @entity69 gov. @entity68 , @entity71 gov. @entity70 and @entity73 gov. @entity72 all said they 'd consider a lawsuit			0
even @entity78 , the colorful sheriff in @entity80 's @entity79 , said he 's suing @entity5 over immigration			2
the list could grow , and it 's already populated with republicans who could enhance their standing among conservatives by hammering a president deeply unpopular with their base			2
there are risks , though			0
immigration could be a tricky issue for @entity1 in 2016 , when their opposition to easing deportation rules -- especially once @entity5 is out of office -- could alienate @entity97 , a rapidly growing group of voters			1
@entity12 said immigration is " just like @entity101 but with different players			1
it 's not just some political positive all the time			0
there will be people who will not appreciate it			0
" read transcript of @entity5 's immigration speech the legal challenge to @entity5 's signature health care reform law was the star turn for @entity113 's @entity112 , who led the multistate battle that reached the @entity115			1
it also turned @entity12 , who had campaigned for office on fighting @entity101 , into a conservative darling -- and catapulted him to the @entity1 nomination in last year 's governor 's race , though he narrowly lost to @entity123 @entity122			1
@entity12 's lawsuit was eventually rejected , but other states had some success with the @entity115 , which rejected a challenge to the law 's individual mandate but allowed states to opt out of its expansion of the @entity134 program			2
@entity12 said attorneys general needed to play a " federalist role , " then and now			1
" if the ag 's position is this violates the law and the separation of powers , it can not stand for that reason alone			0
whatever anyone may think of immigration , then that 's the job of the attorney general , " he said			2
opinion : @entity5 's immigration move is a win @entity12 said there is strength in numbers for attorneys general who , while elected in most states , are usually lower - key lawyers unaccustomed to the spotlight that comes with taking on the @entity157			1
" when one person does something , you look like an outlier , " he said			0
" and whether it makes sense or not , the states get a certain level of respect from the courts that other people do n't			0
when you file an amicus brief and you represent a state , the court reads your brief			0
it is a powerful position to make the legal assault from			0
