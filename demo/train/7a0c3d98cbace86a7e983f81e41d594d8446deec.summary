-- @entity2 's third - generation @entity1 , due at dealerships this spring , will have an optional solar panel on its roof			1
the panel will power a ventilation system that can cool the car without help from the engine , @entity2 says			1
@entity11 in @entity12 makes a roof - mounted solar panel for a standard @entity15			1
but it 's a long way from the @entity1 to a solar - powered car , experts told @entity0			1
most agree that there just is n't enough space on a production car to get full power from solar panels			2
" being able to power a car entirely with solar is a pretty far - reaching goal , " said @entity24 , a senior engineer at the federal government 's @entity25 in @entity27 , @entity28			1
in the new prius , the solar panel will provide energy for a ventilation fan that will help cool the parked car on sunny , hot days			1
the driver can start the fan remotely before stepping into the car			0
once the car is started , the air conditioning wo n't need as much energy from a battery to do the rest of the cooling			2
" the best thing about using solar is that regardless of what you end up using it for , you 're trying to use it to displace gasoline , " added @entity24			0
the question is , how much gasoline can solar power offset ? @entity24 said his lab has modified a @entity1 to use electricity from the grid for its main batteries and a solar panel for the auxiliary systems			1
he believes the car gets an additional 5 miles of electric range from the panel			2
according to recent articles in @entity68 's @entity67 newspaper , @entity2 has bigger plans for harnessing power from the sun. @entity67 reports that @entity2 hopes to develop a vehicle powered entirely by solar panels			1
the project will take years , the paper reported			0
when contacted by @entity0 , however , a @entity2 spokeswoman denied the existence of the project			0
" at this time there are no plans that we know of to produce a concept or production version of a solar - powered car , " said @entity79 , a communications administrator in @entity2 's @entity80			1
motorists do n't have to wait for a 2010 @entity1 to drive a solar - enhanced car , however			1
@entity89 , president of @entity11 in @entity90 , @entity12 , said his company makes a roof - mounted panel for a standard prius that enables the car to travel up to 15 additional miles a day			1
the system costs $ 3,500 , and it takes about a week to make one , @entity89 said			0
@entity98 , a project coordinator at the company , said @entity11 gets so many requests for the system that there is a backlog of several months			2
the company 's web site says motorists can install the panels themselves , although it recommends finding a " qualified technician			2
" the system delivers about 165 watts of power per hour to an added battery , which helps powers the electric motor , @entity89 said			2
but others said it would take a lot more power than that to replace an internal combustion engine			2
@entity120 , director of the @entity121 at @entity121 , said that even if solar cells worked far better than they do today , they would n't generate enough power for driving substantial distances			0
the best cells operate at about 33 percent efficiency , but the ones used on vehicles are only about 18 percent efficient , he said			0
@entity120 said it would be more practical to use solar power to help charge a car 's battery and use the more efficient panels mounted on a roof or over a parking area to supply the rest of the electricity needed to drive the engine			1
" solar panels really need a lot of area , " he said			0
@entity120 thinks @entity2 's new prius is a good first step toward using renewable energy			0
some cars get hotter than 150 degrees inside when parked in the sun , so reducing the temperature could mean @entity2 could use a smaller @entity149 unit , he added			0
@entity150 said he 'd like to see @entity2 bring the weight of a prius down from 3,000 pounds to 2,000			0
he also hopes for a small gasoline engine and a larger electric motor			0
that will probably come in the future , when @entity2 unveils a plug - in engine			0
in the meantime , @entity11 sells its version of a plug - in prius , with a solar panel installed , for $ 25,000 , @entity98 said			1
@entity2 is the largest automaker to incorporate solar power into a mass - produced car			1
but its solar panel is not the first for a car company			1
@entity167 uses one on its upscale @entity169 model , and @entity170 tried one on its 929 in the 1990s			0
in addition , a @entity173 motor company , @entity172 , has produced an electric - solar hybrid			2
the @entity177 model costs $ 30,000 , looks like a souped - up golf cart and uses roof - mounted solar panels to help power an electric engine			1
it has a range of about 30 miles and has a top speed of about 30 mph			0
@entity0 's @entity184 contributed to this story .			0

the 2010 @entity15 , due this spring , will have an optional solar panel on its roof
the panel will power a cooling system without help from the engine
one company also makes a roof - mounted solar panel for *current* @entity1 models
but it 's a long way from the new @entity1 to a solar - powered car , experts say
