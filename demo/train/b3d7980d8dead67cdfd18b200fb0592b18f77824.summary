-- by now , early adopters of the @entity1 , which has sold more than 4 million units since debuting on friday , have no doubt taken @entity3 for a spin			1
the voice - activated " personal assistant " is a talkative tool that helps schedule appointments , send and receive messages and perform any number of other routine tasks			1
but for @entity1 owners presented with the sci - fi dream of a computer that talks back in a robotic female voice , the temptation to test the app 's more random -- and existential -- sides has been pretty overwhelming , too			1
the @entity19 , always up for a chuckle , has noticed			2
blog posts , tweets and even whole websites are popping up to share what happens when users start testing the boundaries of the app by peppering @entity3 with off - the - wall questions			1
the findings ? @entity3 can be a sometimes sassy , sometimes snide companion			1
and she 's at least as fond of an inside joke as she is of reading you your e-mails			2
one key hub for all things @entity3 is @entity34 , a @entity36 blog on which people post their odd question - and - answer exchanges with the app. among some of its more creative entries : q : @entity44 me up			1
q : am i fat ? a : i prefer not to say			2
q : what are you wearing ? a : you have the wrong personal assistant , @entity50			1
@entity3 is clearly ready to drop a pop culture reference or two , as well as do a serviceable version of the @entity54 " @entity55 ? " routine			1
this awareness and sense of humor has already earned her some fans			2
" i 'm not sure who 's responsible for these hilarious responses : @entity63 engineers or maybe a bunch of @entity66 joke writers			2
but i dearly love stumbling onto them , " wrote @entity68 tech columnist @entity67			2
" if you ask me , the technology world would be a lot better off if there were more humor everywhere			2
" @entity76 's @entity75 wrote one of the more popular @entity3 posts after playing with a review model			1
he gave the app high marks after it not only offered to call a cab when he said he was drunk ( and not drunk - dial his ex-girlfriend ) but also gave directions to mental - health facilities when he told it ( presumably jokingly ) that he wanted to kill himself			1
" it 's kind of like having the unpaid intern of my dreams at my beck and call , organizing my life for me , " @entity75 wrote			2
" i think @entity3 on the @entity1 is a life changer , and this is only the beginning			1
" you can program the app to say your name in responses , or if you 'd prefer to admire @entity3 from afar , there 's already a @entity101 page and a handful of @entity3 - inspired @entity103 feeds			1
( the official feed for the app appears to have gone inactive last august , however , a few months after @entity63 bought @entity3 )			1
@entity3 was n't actually ready to protest when the " will it blend " guys dropped an @entity1 into a blender			1
like its predecessor , the phone was torn to shreds , but the " scientists " could n't resist throwing some fake @entity3 audio onto the @entity113 video , which has more than a half - million views			1
" would you like to not blend the @entity1 instead ? " fake @entity3 says			1
" you are making a terrible error			0
" and there 's more than one " @entity119 " for some of the more popular questions			2
asking the meaning of life , professing your love or quoting lines from " 2001 : @entity126 " -- the sci - fi classic in which astronauts must combat @entity130 , an artificial intelligence with a deceptively soothing , robotic voice -- all produce multiple responses from @entity3			1
we threw what we hoped would be some fairly random questions at @entity3 to see what we got			1
it 's more fun when you ascribe emotion to @entity3 's computer - generated , female voice			1
it also makes it easy to hear a touch of indignation when we asked her to whip up a snack , and true remorse when she could n't do what was asked			0
here are snippets of our conversation : q : @entity3 , what is the meaning of life ? a : i ca n't answer that now , but give me some time to write a very long play in which nothing happens			1
q : @entity3 , make me a sandwich			1
a : i do n't know what you mean by " @entity3 , make me a sandwich			1
" q : let 's play global thermonuclear war			0
a : i could n't find " @entity171 " in your music			0
q : download " @entity173			0
" a : i ca n't download things for you			0
i feel terrible about this			0
q : open the pod bay doors , @entity3			1
a : i do n't know what you mean by " open the pod bay doors , @entity3			1
" q : open the pod bay doors , @entity130			0
a : everyone knows what happened to @entity130			0
i 'd rather not talk about it			0
but if you insist : [ search the web for @entity130 ] q : @entity3 , are you affiliated with @entity189 ? a : i ca n't answer that			1
q : @entity3 , i 'm lonely			2
a : if you say so			0
q : no really , i feel all alone			0
q : will you be my friend ? a : my ontology does not contain a representation of " love			0
" q : you sound hot , @entity3			2
a : ok , here 's a place matching " @entity3			2
" it 's a little ways from you			0
[ map with directions to @entity206 , 60 miles away ]			0
q : can you tell me a joke ? a : i do n't really know any good jokes			0
q : can you tell me a bad joke ? a : two iphones walk into a bar ... i forget the rest			0
q : i 'm bored			0
a : i bore you ? q : i 'm sleepy			0
a : i hope you 're not driving			0
q : what 's a good place to get drunk around here ? a : i found a number of bars fairly close to you			0
i 've sorted them by rating			0
now i have a hangover			0
a : i found a number of bars fairly close to you			0
i 've sorted them by rating			0
q : how much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood ? a : do n't you have anything better to do ?			0
