@entity0 -- depicting , among other things , @entity6 's procession to the cross , @entity9 soldiers presiding over an execution in sixteenth - century @entity11 and a mysterious mill perched atop a hollow cliff , @entity4 the @entity3 's 1564 painting " the way to @entity20 " is a complex , multi-layered work laden with symbolism and drama			1
looking at it , according to @entity23 director @entity22 , is rather like watching a movie unfold -- which is why he has brought the painting to life in his new feature film " @entity29			1
" " i started as a painter and as a poet and i went to make movies strictly because i believed that the painters i was fascinated would be making movies if they were still alive , " he told @entity1			0
based on a book about the painting called " @entity29 , " @entity22 's film shows @entity4 ( played by @entity39 ) discussing the development of his work with patron @entity42 ( played by @entity43 )			1
faithfully recreated vignettes play out alongside scenes portraying the artist 's creative process , while others depict a mysterious miller figure , representing @entity50 , presiding over a mill improbably located on top of a sheer , hollow cliff			0
" @entity29 " premiered in @entity0 in march , and has received favorable reviews , notably from " the @entity56 , " whose critic @entity57 called the film an " inspiring , alluring meditation about imagery and storytelling			2
" @entity63 is drawn to bringing art to life : he wrote the screenplay for 1996 film " @entity71 , " about the life of @entity70 artist @entity69 , and directed 2004 film " @entity73 , " which follows an art historian entering into @entity76 's famous triptych			1
" for me , @entity4 is time , " said the director			2
" you can not just come and look once at one of his paintings , you always have to enter the work			0
" he has this magnetic pull and once you 're in , you become entangled in what the figures are doing and you make up your own stories			0
you can spend your whole life with it , easily outside of the length of a movie , " he said			2
transporting the painting into such a different medium , however , took patience : the result is a mix of old - fashioned craftsmanship and the latest in digital film - making technology			1
costumes were hand - sewn by @entity23 seamstresses and dyed with tints made from boiled onions , beetroots and apples , as they would have been in @entity4 's day ; the " right " color black was achieved by burning a candle against a pane of glass , rather than relying on computers to recreate the exact hue ; and @entity22 himself had to take up @entity4 's brush and complete a partially - visible tree in the top - left corner of the painting to extend the field of vision for the camera to pan across			1
but some of the more complex scenes , such as the motions of the mill on the rock , required the use of @entity126 and @entity127			0
" many times i felt that we were doing a digital tapestry , thread by thread , " said @entity22			1
" we were extremely lucky in that we were riding the crest of wave in technological advancements because literally every week the guys in the computer department were discovering new plug - ins and new developments in the field and employing it for what i wanted to achieve , " he said			0
the film , he explained , was composed of layers , because the @entity11 of the painting is a surreal figment of the artist 's imagination , comprising seven different perspectives			0
obtaining the " key " to this aesthetic was hard work , said @entity22 , because " @entity4 is a magician in creating these illusory kinds of funnels in the painting			1
" he added : " his landscapes are like funnels that your eye is dipped into and goes to naturally ; he knows how to keep your eye employed and moving			0
" an exhibition of @entity22 's work , including his film installation " @entity163 , " based on " @entity29 " is currently on view at @entity165 in @entity0			2
" @entity29 " opens in cinemas in @entity167 on march 30 , in @entity168 in april , and in @entity9 in june			0
the painting which inspired the film , @entity4 's " @entity171 " is in the collection of the @entity173 , @entity174 .			2
