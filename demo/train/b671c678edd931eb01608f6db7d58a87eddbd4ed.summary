@entity0 -- the mother of a woman police identified as one of eight found dead on an isolated strip of waterfront property on @entity7 , @entity0 , told @entity1 that a man using the victim 's cell phone made taunting calls and claimed he killed 24 - year - old @entity12			1
" do you think you 'll ever see her again ? , " the unidentified male caller asked @entity15 's sister on august 26 , 2009 , according to @entity16 , an attorney for the victim 's mother			2
i killed her , " he added and hung up			0
the phone call ended after less than a minute			0
another phone call was placed in july 2009 just days after @entity15 disappeared			0
it was the first of seven calls he made from @entity15 's cell phone			1
@entity16 said that in the phone call the unidentified male caller referred to @entity15 as a " whore " in a short conversation with her then - 15 - year - old sister			1
in the final call , the man described in graphic detail to the victim 's sister what he had done sexually to @entity15 , @entity16 said			2
@entity15 's mother and sister kept a journal of the calls that was turned over to police early in the investigation			1
the content of the calls could help police as they work to put together a profile of the suspected serial killer			2
@entity16 described the man in the calls as " a calculating , stone - cold killer			1
" " he premeditated his acts , " @entity16 said			0
" he knew what he was doing and my personal belief is that @entity12 was not his first victim			1
he started to get good at this , and he 's getting better at it			0
" @entity15 was last seen alive in the @entity60 of @entity0 and was later identified among three other bodies found on a quarter - mile stretch of waterfront property near @entity64 , @entity7			1
the other three bodies have since been identified as @entity66 , 25 , of @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69 , 27 , of @entity70 , @entity0 ; and @entity71 , 22 , of @entity72 , @entity73			0
the remains of at least four other people have been found on @entity7 but have not been identified in an investigation that stretches back to december			1
the grisly finds occurred as police searched for @entity79 , 24 , who was last seen alive in may in the neighboring @entity81 area			2
@entity82 has not been located			0
the massive search by police and federal agents in @entity86 and @entity88 counties , where the human remains located so far have been found , comes two years after the alleged phone calls			1
@entity91 said in january that calls from @entity12 's cell phone had been traced to midtown @entity93 , with the two last calls made from around @entity95 and @entity96			1
the caller hung up too quickly for authorities to pinpoint the exact locations of the calls , police said			2
the victim 's family has described the calls previously , but only recently revealed the admission of guilt			2
the four victims who have been identified were all women who advertised prostitution services on websites such as @entity111 , police have said			0
meanwhile , aviation teams flying over parts of @entity7 had " identified a significant number of items that are n't natural for the area , " said @entity88 acting police commissioner @entity112			1
but as of friday , authorities had not uncovered any further human remains			0
earlier this week , police discovered skeletal remains -- including a human skull -- prompting the widening search			1
police have not said whether the most recent remains are from different people , or if they could have come from the eight victims found previously			2
airplanes and helicopters with high - resolution technology are being used in the search effort			0
the remains found monday in a @entity88 wildlife preserve were wrapped in a " black plastic product " similar to a plastic bag , a law enforcement source said wednesday			0
the remains " appeared to be part of a lower extremity , " the source said			0
police have said the @entity7 remains are not connected to the bodies of four prostitutes found near @entity145 , @entity146 , in 2006			1
federal agents first joined police in the investigation in december after the first four bodies were found			1
that discovery on a quarter - mile stretch of @entity64 indicated that " they were dumped there by the same person or persons , " @entity86 police commissioner @entity151 told reporters at the time			0
" it 's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location			0

the mother of a victim says a man called claiming he killed 24 - year - old @entity12
calls from her cell phone were traced to @entity93
police and federal agents are searching for skeletal remains on @entity7
the remains of at least eight bodies have been found since december
