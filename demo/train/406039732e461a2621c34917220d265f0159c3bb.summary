-- once , high school football was the thing that brought people together in the eastern @entity5 town of @entity6			1
that was before two star players of the @entity10 football team , demigods in this small , down - on - its - luck town along the banks of the @entity14 , were accused last summer of raping a 16 - year - old girl , part of a series of alleged assaults chronicled on social media			1
with the two boys at the center of the case set to go to trial on rape charges on wednesday , an unwelcome national spotlight is shining on @entity6			1
the case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even @entity28 , a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers , who have questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the veracity of the investigation			1
amid social media pressure and allegations of a cover - up , community leaders went on the offensive on the eve of the trial to offer support for community businesses and the embattled football team known as " @entity10			1
" " we all want to see justice prevail for the victim and the defendants in this case			1
all of you are here today because you are doing your job and writing your story , " @entity47 , the president of the @entity49 @entity48 , told reporters on tuesday			1
" there ( are ) , however , always multiple sides to every story			2
there is the other side of our community , a side that has been overshadowed by this incident			2
unfortunately , our community has been painted with one very unflattering , broad brush			2
" critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by players of the @entity10 team , and have suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them			1
while community leaders refused to address the allegations directly , they defended the actions of the police department			2
" we are a good city			2
we have good people here			2
our police department is outstanding			2
they have done everything they can in this particular case , " he said			2
social media photos , video and social media messages are at the heart of criminal charges against the two players -- @entity91 and @entity92 , both juveniles -- accused of sexually assaulting the girl during a series of end - of - summer parties in august			1
both boys have been identified by a judge in court , by defense attorneys and in newspapers and other media reports			1
@entity0 is not identifying the girl , who also is a juvenile , in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims			1
crime blogger @entity108 , a former @entity6 resident , discovered and preserved many of the online messages about the case , at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities			2
she first spotted the story in the small town 's newspaper and started looking into the situation on a hunch that the highly regarded football team 's members were getting special treatment at the expense of the victim			0
one image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by @entity28 showed the girl , dressed in a t - shirt and blue shorts , her body limp , being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers			1
text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident , calling the girl " sloppy , " making references to rape and suggesting that she had been urinated on , @entity136 has said			1
@entity0 has not been able to establish whether this is true			0
in one 12 - minute video , posted by @entity28 , one teenager makes multiple jokes about the girl 's condition , saying she must have died because she did n't move during one assault			1
police got involved on august 14 , when the girl 's mother reported the alleged assaults , according to @entity6 police chief @entity153			1
the family provided a zip drive showing a @entity157 page , possibly with a photo , @entity153 said			0
@entity153 has said the same day the boys were charged , @entity49 authorities asked for help from the state attorney general 's office in investigating and prosecuting the case			1
on tuesday , @entity153 told reporters that in the weeks after the story broke he received what he called " hate e-mails			0
" " those bother me			0
i have a little girl , " he said			1
while the attention died down for a bit , it began anew this week ahead of the trial			0
" it 's been tough for a lot of us			0
but we 've gotten good feedback from the community , " he said			0
@entity6 was once a thriving steel mill town			0
with the mills closed , the town is a shadow of its former self as a number of its residents moved away to find work elsewhere and a number of businesses closed			0
today , its population is primarily blue collar with a median income between $ 33,000 and $ 34,000 , well below the national average			0
the @entity10 football games have long been a gathering point for residents , who point to the team 's against - all - odds play that helped elevate its reputation in the state			1
since the case gained national prominence , community leaders have been working with organizations to help students deal with the stresses of the case , city manager @entity200 said			0
some of the students are angry about the things being said by critics , she said , adding that some students were unsure whether they should wear their @entity6 letter jackets in public			0
resident @entity213 , who has been a proponent of the football team , called the critics ' allegations hurtful			0
" anybody that is attacking your family or your hometown , naturally you are going to stand up and defend it , " he said			0
" we are proud of them , and they show our worth , our values , our work ethic			0
... naturally , we are going to stand behind them and support them , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
