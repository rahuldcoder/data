@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity5 got word about the oil spill in the @entity8 , like many @entity4 , she wanted to help -- but she wanted to help in a very specific way			1
@entity5 runs an organization called the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) in @entity0 , @entity1			2
the organization houses injured and sick wildlife and nurses them back to health so that they can be released back into the wild			1
working very closely with animals , she realized that the region 's wildlife could be in serious danger because of the oil spill disaster			2
the @entity12 takes in over a thousand animals a year -- possums , raccoons , deer and birds			0
seeing images of oiled birds and wildlife splashed across the news channels , @entity5 wanted to be ready in case they were called upon to take in these animals			2
after recognizing that people in her community were feeling the same way , @entity5 and the @entity12 organized a volunteer day and opened their doors to locals who wanted to help out			0
in just that one day they received roughly $ 19,000 in cash , supplies and free labor , including $ 5,400 in donations and $ 13,600 in labor and supplies			1
@entity5 believes that her community wanted to help because the wildlife is so much a part of what the state is all about			0
" the whole panhandle is a rural area , " @entity5 said			0
" and that 's what our livelihoods depend on			1
so without wildlife , we 'd be very damaged			0
