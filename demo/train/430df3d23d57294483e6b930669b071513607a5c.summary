the @entity1 confirmed @entity6 test results on friday			0
" the @entity1 , @entity47 ( @entity47 ) and @entity48 ( @entity49 ) do not consider passengers on the flight or bus to be close contacts of the patient and therefore are not at high risk , " said dr. @entity46 , director of the @entity47			2

the coronavirus , known as @entity65 , was first reported in the @entity75 -- specifically , the @entity76 -- in 2012			1
laboratory testing has confirmed 262 cases of the coronavirus in 12 countries , including the @entity6 case , @entity12 said			1
ninety - three people have died			0
so far , all @entity4 cases have been linked to six countries on or near the @entity76 , @entity12 said			1
the @entity10 @entity85 has reported 339 cases , and said nearly a third of those have died			1
not all of the @entity10 cases have been confirmed by the @entity91			1
" the @entity4 virus is of grave concern because of the virulence , " @entity12 said			1
but , she added , " we 're not yet aware of confirmed sustained community transmission			0
" late last month , @entity10 officials noted a spike in new cases			1
the @entity1 has expected @entity4 to come to the @entity3 , @entity12 said			2
" we have been preparing for this			0
" however , " the introduction of @entity65 is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away , " she said			0

the @entity1 has issued general precautions such as frequent hand - washing , avoiding close contact with infected people , avoiding touching your eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands , and disinfecting surfaces that are frequently touched			0
pediatricians should ask about where young patients with high fever and respiratory symptoms have traveled , @entity12 said			2

currently , the @entity1 does not recommend changing travel plans because of the virus , @entity12 said			0
no one knows exactly how this virus originated , but evidence is emerging implicating camels			0
in a recently published study in @entity155 , researchers said they isolated live @entity4 virus from two single - humped camels , known as dromedaries			2
they found multiple substrains in the camel viruses , including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient			2
the same group of researchers reported in february that nearly three - quarters of camels in @entity10 tested positive for past exposure to the @entity4 coronavirus			1
@entity4 mystery : @entity172 found in camels although many of the cases have occurred on the @entity76 , people have died of the infection elsewhere , including in @entity178 countries and @entity179 in @entity180			1
@entity181 reported its first case on april 26 , according to the @entity91			0
limited human - to - human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries -- meaning some people who traveled to the @entity75 gave the virus to others			1
officials are not aware of any other confirmed @entity3 cases , @entity12 said , adding it 's too early to assume no one else is ill. an active investigation is underway			2
