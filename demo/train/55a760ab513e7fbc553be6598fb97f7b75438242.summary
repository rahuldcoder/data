the fire 's evacuation area was 93,000 acres , affecting approximately 38,000 people and 13,000 homes , and the flames were estimated to have burned through 15,700 acres , said @entity8			1
that marked a dramatic increase from the 8,500 acres officials said had been burned by wednesday night , he noted			1
after he spoke , residents of about 1,000 homes in @entity0 were told to evacuate			1
" @entity51 is probably our no. 1 threat , " the sheriff said			1
combined with dry brush and high temperatures , the winds have fanned devastating flames			2
@entity8 struggled to find a phrase to describe how ferocious the fire is , settling on " very dynamic			2

however , now i 'm grateful that i know			2
a lot of people here just do n't know , " @entity71 said			2
in northeast @entity0 , @entity2 ireporter @entity96 took photos outside her home , capturing a billowing plume of smoke			2
one shot shows just how wide the smoke was on the horizon			2
a county fairground northeast of the @entity22 looked like a @entity106 with families who fled with their animals to escape the looming inferno			1
there were nearly 30 chickens , several hundred horses , a handful of cows and a couple calves , and many alpacas and miniature horses , according to the @entity118			2

" i had a pillowcase full of socks , and that 's basically all i have			1
" by thursday afternoon , she got bad news			0
a friend called her to say that her home was on an online list of residences that had been designated as destroyed			1
@entity161 did n't know exactly where the friend had seen the information but she believed it to be true			0
for a person who had just been told their home was gone , @entity161 had a cheerful attitude when talking with @entity2 , laughing and saying that she was just going to go back home when she could , hitch up a trailer on the property , live in that and rebuild her house			0
her home sat on five acres and she does n't think the land has been damaged			1

" there are areas of the @entity225 that we have not been able to get into at all to make any sort of assessment			0
so it 's almost impossible to come up with another number , but it is safe to assume that that number will in fact rise , " he said			1
@entity235 , a 12 - year resident of the area , watched wednesday as the @entity22 gained ground on his home			1
there was n't much else he could do			0
