@entity0 -- a year ago , @entity2 and her daughter @entity3 found themselves standing in tears in the middle of broken glass , scattered clothes hangers , bits of wedding dresses and burnt pieces of fabric			1
their small shop in south @entity0 had been targeted by a mob of looters during the city 's worst riots in two decades			1
it happened a few days after they celebrated the 20th anniversary of opening their business -- @entity2 's , a fashion workshop with designs inspired by the owners ' @entity27 roots			1
in just a few hours of riot madness , @entity2 and @entity3 lost 20 years ' worth of work			1
a display of valuable dresses made for high - profile celebrities : gone			0
unique accessories , some from remote parts of the world : gone			0
wedding dresses ready to be picked up by brides - to - be : gone			0
the overall loss is hard to estimate -- on top of all the things lost and damaged , business slowed down for months			2
" we were boarded for three months , that 's how long it took , " @entity3 said			1
" people thought we folded , it felt like we were in prison , " @entity2 added			1
they estimate a loss of Â£ 30 - 40,000 ( $ 55,000 - 65,000 ) , but say it 's hard to put a number on it			2
" the things are worth so much more			0
we made them all , they are irreplaceable , " @entity3 said			1
fast forward a year and the place looks like nothing had ever happened			2
the only visible reminder of last year 's events is a couple of wooden boards leaning against the wall			1
they used to cover the smashed windows			0
watch video : @entity0 riots one year on now they serve as a notice board , with pictures and supportive letters from customers that flooded the boutique after the riots			1
" people sent messages , emails , they phoned to say they were sorry , " @entity3 said			1
" a friend of mine had to come in for a week just to answer the phone and reply to messages			0
" the revival of the boutique is down to the @entity89 ' loyal customers			2
" lots of our regular customers made an effort to help			0
they did n't really need anything , and they would still come and buy something			0
our customers are amazing , " @entity3 said			1
there was a point , they say , when they wanted to leave the shop closed and walk away			0
but the customers kept coming			0
" having the customers , the work , it kept us going , we were on autopilot , " @entity3 said			1
" it was exactly as the @entity110 say : ' keep calm and carry on			0
' " thank - you notes from clients are displayed all around @entity2 's			1
many include wedding and honeymoon photos , as the boutique has long been a hotspot for brides who want something special			2
" for the brides , weddings are about culture , " @entity3 said			1
" they want to express their heritage , even if they are very modern , and they always ask us how they can show where they come from and who they are			2
" the traditional - meets - modern is the key to their success			0
@entity2 , originally from @entity137 , came to @entity0 from @entity138 , where her daughter @entity3 was born to a @entity141 father			1
it may sound complicated , but the multicultural heritage of the two women is exactly what makes their clothes special			2
" we are inspired by modern @entity27 , " @entity3 said			1
" we consider ourselves @entity27 , but are also @entity148 , and that shows in our designs			1
" their dresses are a mixture of modern cuts , @entity27 - inspired prints and precious fabrics from all around the world			1
picking up a beautifully shaped dress , @entity3 points out the fabric			1
it comes from a remote area in @entity162 , where it was handmade			0
together with a @entity166 - style cut , it makes for a special piece of couture			0
" i always talk to our customers about the story behind fabrics , " she said			0
" it 's nice to walk around knowing where your clothes came from			2
" the mother - daughter pair work as a team			2
@entity3 talks to the customers and prepares the designs , while @entity2 is the one cutting the fabric and sewing			1
the workshop is strictly divided in two zones			0
each woman has her own territory , where she rules			0
they say it works perfectly , even though they both admit there are clashes from time to time			0
" she is my mum , you always have to do what your mum tells you to , " @entity3 admitted			1
" but we are also business partners			0
we have to negotiate and agree on everything			0
sometimes it stretches your relationship to the limits			0
" on the one - year anniversary of the looting the boutique was unusually quiet , and there was time for reflection			2
" i could n't ask for a better daughter , " @entity2 said , doubting she would have been able to cope without her during the long months of recovery			2
then suddenly , she turned to @entity3 and said : " you have more strength than i thought you have			1
i 've seen you rise so much			0
i am proud of you -- i never had the time to tell you			0

" @entity2 's " boutique in @entity0 was *destroyed* by looters in last year 's riots
having lost everything , the owners @entity2 and @entity3 thought of giving up
a year later , their boutique is back on its feet and *thriving*
the pair 's dress designs are inspired by their @entity27 heritage
