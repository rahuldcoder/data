-- there is still much we do n't know about what happened during the crash of @entity5 , in which two people were killed in @entity7 on saturday			1
but we do know that of the 305 survivors on board that @entity11 , 123 actually walked away from the scene , something that may seem unimaginable if you view the amateur video of the wide - body jet somersaulting while bursting into flames			2
the city 's fire chief described the survival of so many as " nothing short of a miracle			1
" but , although we persist in thinking divine intervention is the only thing that can save a flight in peril , it 's no longer a miracle when even hundreds of passengers survive the worst of accidents			1
the " miracle of @entity38 " and the " miracle on the @entity40 " are just two examples of recent flight disasters in which everyone on board survived			1
and the danger of " miracle " thinking is that it lulls some passengers into not learning more about how best practices can save lives			1
are all airline crashes survivable ? of course not			2
but the statistics tell the story			2
in 2001 , the @entity51 released an exhaustive study of @entity54 airline accidents over a 17 - year period and found that 95.7 % of occupants survived			0
i wrote a book that focused on airline safety , and my research led me to interview dozens of aviation safety experts , including several who work for @entity11 in @entity63			1
( the @entity65 flight was on a @entity11			0
) in recent years , aircraft manufacturers have focused on a multipronged approach to survivability : in addition to accident avoidance , great strides have been made in helping occupants survive the impact , post-crash fires and fumes , and safely evacuate			0
@entity11 experts told me that many of the most significant advancements in safety were developing safer materials for carpeting , seats , and other cabin components			1
these new materials reduce flammability and toxic fumes during those critical first minutes after a fire starts			0
experts also pointed to improved evacuation slides , which historically suffered high failure rates during actual emergencies			0
but it is n't all about technological advancements ; human factors also play a critical role			1
and here is where " miraculous survival " thinking is a danger : it can cause some passengers to not learn more about how best practices -- not miracles -- can save their lives			1
even the most frequent fliers may not realize how simple actions can dramatically improve their chances of survival			1
i 'm not suggesting that flying has to be a white - knuckle , continually vigilant experience			0
i am suggesting that you not zone out during " key phases " of the flight , such as takeoff , landing , severe turbulence , and irregular operations			1
only 11 % of fatal accidents happened at cruising altitude			0
instead , consider the following to enhance your safety : listen : you may be a veteran flier -- but that does n't mean you do n't need to pay attention during the preflight instructions			1
emergency egress procedures can vary widely , even among similar aircraft types			2
dress smart : wear comfortable , flat - heeled shoes that wo n't fall off easily			2
flip - flops and high heels are the wrong attire for evacuation slides			0
avoid highly flammable polyesters and pantyhose ; think cotton and wool			0
seating : choosing a seat involves many factors , but access to emergency exits may end up being the most important for you			2
count the rows to the nearest exit , since you may need to find it under dark or smoky conditions			0
@entity144 buckled : you know that admonition to always stay belted while you 're in your seat ? do it			1
severe turbulence can maim and even kill			1
secure your stuff : loose items = projectiles			0
drinking / medications / sleeping : during key phases of flight , it 's critical that you remain sharp			0
booze and meds can severely impair your ability to follow instructions			0
strapping : the only safe place for a child under 2 years old is in an approved restraint system			0
both the @entity51 and the @entity164 agree on this , though the @entity164 wo n't mandate that airlines ban children sitting in adults ' laps			2
do n't believe that g - forces are for real ? take another look at the @entity65 video ; then imagine holding a child throughout that ordeal			2
in the years ahead , the airline industry may remember @entity5 for another reason			0
an alarming number of passengers on saturday took the time to retrieve their luggage -- even bags in the overhead bins , no less -- before evacuating that burning aircraft			1
words fail when contemplating how such thoughtless actions threatened so many lives			0
so let 's add this to the list : do n't even think about evacuating while carrying anything that is n't alive			1
inevitably , some will scoff at learning more about survivability			0
i 've read scores of armchair experts who assert that no one can walk away from a plane crash			0
do n't listen to them -- they can cost you or your loved ones your lives			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : seeing survival as a " miracle " lulls fliers into ignoring safety procedures
@entity211 : stay alert during takeoff , landing and severe turbulence
@entity211 : listening , staying buckled , knowing where exits are can save your life
he says do n't even think about retrieving luggage while evacuating
