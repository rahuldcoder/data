editor 's note : since becoming @entity4 producer in 2000 , @entity2 has covered four secretaries of state and reported from more than 50 countries			0

@entity11 foreign minister @entity10 and secretary of state @entity12 meet in @entity13			1
@entity13 ( @entity8 ) -- @entity11 foreign minister @entity10 made the rounds in @entity13 just as president @entity16 's national security team shifted its attention to @entity11			1
this week secretary of defense @entity18 called the @entity21 border with @entity11 the " epicenter of jihad			0
" and the renewed focus on @entity11 suggests that @entity16 has a new role for @entity11 in the battle against @entity27 and the @entity28			0
after all , in developing a strategy for " @entity30 , " @entity16 acknowledged the @entity31 can not win in @entity21 without cooperation from @entity11 , the suspected hideout of @entity33 and other @entity27 leaders			1
which is why the buzzword of both @entity10 and @entity31 secretary of state @entity12 this week was " partnership , " as in the @entity31 and @entity11 are united in a " strategic partnership " against a common enemy			1
right now , the relationship between the two countries is less a partnership and more an uneasy marriage with a history fraught with decades of mutual mistrust and disappointment			1
in the late 1980s , the @entity31 partnered with @entity11 to supply mujahedeen fighters with weapons and training to defeat the @entity51 in @entity21			1
then the @entity31 abandoned the region , leaving the @entity11 , in @entity54 's words , " awash in drugs ... and jihadists who had been trained up in conjunction with us			1
" now the @entity31 are back			0
but , rightly , the @entity11 are wondering if this time they will stay			0
this week @entity10 urged the @entity31 not to repeat history , but rather to articulate a " long - term commitment " for the region			1
that 's exactly what the @entity31 is trying to do with an aid package worth $ 1.5 billion a year for five years for social and economic development and with discretionary military spending			1
by building roads , schools and democratic institutions , the @entity31 hopes to combat both @entity71 extremism and anti-americanism			0
in part the aid has had the opposite effect			0
tough conditions attached to the aid to ensure the @entity11 are fighting terrorism on their own soil have prompted fears and resentment about renewed -- and unwanted -- @entity31 influence			1
the military spending in the @entity86 - @entity85 legislation threatens to cut off assistance if @entity11 fails to crack down on extremists or uses the funding to attack neighboring countries , namely @entity91			2
it requires @entity11 's cooperation in efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons networks operating in the country and demands @entity11 provides the information about its military budget and chain of command , all of which has given birth to grave concern in the military that the aid package is compromising @entity11 's sovereignty			1
the bill also makes reference to the southwestern city of @entity109 and eastern town of @entity111			0
both are believed to be hubs for @entity27 and @entity28 leaders , which suggests that the @entity31 could target those cities for the kind of drone attacks which have drawn @entity11 ire			1
as the @entity11 parliament debates the bill , street protests over the aid have spread through the country			2
the fears about sovereignty have only been aggravated over @entity31 plans to send hundreds more diplomats to its embassy in @entity129			0
@entity13 says the additional staff is needed to distribute and monitor the aid , but it has all left @entity11 humiliated and feeling like a child who needs a babysitter			0
@entity11 also wants more credit from the @entity31 for decisive action it has taken against terrorists , including its recent offensive in the @entity138			1
the @entity31 has been impressed by the @entity11 army 's recent offensive against the @entity28 in @entity138			2
and it is encouraged that @entity11 is gearing up to launch a major offensive in @entity142 , believed to be a stronghold of both the @entity28 and @entity27			0
but the conditions attached to the aid are a symptom of the @entity31 ' longstanding doubts about the @entity11 ' capacity to be a reliable partner it needs in the struggle against @entity27 and the @entity28			1
not only are there concerns about @entity11 intelligence ties to extremist networks , but the @entity31 continues to fear @entity11 's obsession with its nuclear neighbor @entity91 will divert its focus from fighting terrorist threats on its own soil			2
as the @entity31 struggles over the future of the mission in @entity21 , @entity11 wants to strengthen cooperation			2
this week @entity10 said the @entity31 needed to share more critical information it has about @entity27 and the @entity28 on its border			2
what 's more , he suggested the administration should consult with both the @entity11 military and civilian government before deciding to send more troops			0
the sad legacy of @entity31 and @entity11 relations can be overcome only if both counties are able to rebuild trust			2
@entity11 needs to answer lingering questions about the country 's commitment to fighting terrorism			0
and after 20 years of neglect , the @entity31 needs to assure @entity11 it wo n't exploit it for its own interests , only to abandon the region once again			2
only then will this uneasy marriage give way to a true partnership .			0
