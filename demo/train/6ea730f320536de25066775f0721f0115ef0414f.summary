-- ahh ! ohh ! spa time at the @entity2 in @entity3 i 'm face down on a massage table looking through glass at fish swimming in the lagoon , as the @entity10 masseuse caresses me with bags of seaweed and creams made from ground pearls and deep - sea water			1
can it get any better than this ? we 're at the @entity22 at the @entity23 , which i 'm told is the largest spa in @entity25 , the first in the world to use water drawn from deep in the @entity29 , which they tell us is extremely pure and rich in minerals			2
it 's just an average mom - and - daughter afternoon together , or once in a lifetime , in this case			2
my friend , @entity35 , her daughter , @entity35 , my daughter , @entity37 , and their two friends , @entity40 and @entity41 -- all newly minted high school grads -- have taken an afternoon off from sailing on our chartered catamaran to enjoy a little spa action , followed by a real shower			2
the two dads have declined our invitation to join us and are snoozing by the pool at the resort			0
as if the massage is n't enough , we luxuriate in a walk - through pool that pummels our legs with jets of water			0
there are also treatments with deep - sea water showers , baths with deep - sea water and hydro massages , marine scrubs and mud treatments ... too bad we only have an afternoon ! of course , my mom never took me to a spa -- i do n't think she 's ever been to one herself -- but i 've taken my wilderness - loving daughters to spas from the @entity68 to @entity69 , from @entity70 to @entity71 from the time they were young teens , and like others their age , they are perfectly at home getting facials and massages ( as long as mom 's paying )			1
it turns out they 've got plenty of company			0
according to the @entity83 , 4 million teens have been to a spa			1
more than half of the hotel resort spas with memberships in @entity83 now have teen programs , and new ones that include younger children are opening all the time			1
an increasing number of resorts have dedicated spaces just for kids and teens -- from @entity96 at the 10 @entity97 around the country ( choose your own sherbet scrub ) to the @entity101 at the @entity102 in @entity103 where you can create your own lip gloss			2
the teen spa area at @entity107 , designed with @entity108 , offers young spa goers a chance to play video games or watch dvds while they wait for their special acne facials , sports massages or skincare lessons			2
the @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , meanwhile , advertises treatments suitable for several " generations " of your family , while the @entity123 in @entity124 has a family spa bungalow that a family can use for an entire day , scheduling alternating treatments with dips in the river			1
" teens we see are experienced spa - goers , " said @entity131 , manager at the @entity132 at @entity133 , @entity134			1
" the younger children who have older spa - goer siblings want to try something too			2
" ( you 'll find junior spa programs in cities ( @entity143 in @entity144 ) , at ski resorts ( the @entity146 in @entity147 ) , in @entity3 ( @entity148 ) and @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , in @entity151 , @entity118 ( @entity152 ) , where birthday party spa camps are all the rage and even on @entity156 and @entity158 cruise ships			2
and the @entity160 @entity159 , which is making a huge effort to attract the family market , is developing an entire teen program to add to their special treatments for honeymooning couples			1
this pampering wo n't necessarily break the bank either , since many " treatments , " especially for younger kids , are substantially discounted			0
the spa treatments at @entity173 's @entity172 start at just $ 6			1
@entity174 at @entity175 in @entity176 now hosts @entity177 with mini treatments			1
admission is just $ 5 and includes yoga , steam , sauna and mini-treatments for as little as $ 10			0
" at the age of six , it 's not often you get to be a princess for an evening and receive royal treatments , " said @entity184 , from @entity185 , @entity176 , who took her daughter @entity186			1
" the special mommy / daughter time made @entity193 ! " " it 's an affordable luxury , " added @entity194 , an attorney from @entity195 , @entity3 , who takes her 9 - year - old daughter , @entity196 , to @entity197 and @entity2 where kids ' treatments might include a junior escape massage ( strawberry kiwi body icing ? )			1
" she loves it , " @entity203 says , adding , it 's a great way to share an experience and have a good time yourself ! while the @entity83 reports that spa goers are opting for fewer and shorter treatments , youth spa programs continue to flourish -- likely because of the reduced fees			1
for that reason , said @entity214 , who took her daughter @entity215 to the spa at @entity217 , " it was well worth the price			0
it made her feel like royalty			0
and just having some special mother / daughter time ( no husband or son allowed ) was special in itself			0
" for tweens and teens , spa treatments are n't just about indulgence either ; they can have a lasting impact			1
" the teen facial made a difference			0
it also helps teach a young girl about taking care of her skin and about taking pride in her appearance , " said @entity233 , who has been taking her daughter , @entity234 , to the @entity116 's @entity235 for years			0
@entity194 jokes she did n't even know what a spa was until she was in college			0
" i 'm giving her everything i did n't have , " she laughs			0
serenity shower , anyone ? ( for more taking the kids , visit www.takingthekids.com , where @entity251 welcomes your questions and comments			0
