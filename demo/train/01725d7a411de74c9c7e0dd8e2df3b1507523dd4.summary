-- as @entity3 prepare for @entity4 , our community has been hauled into the violence that plagues our nation			1
at this moment , we do n't know for certain whether the killings sunday at two @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , were aimed exclusively at @entity3 , but it certainly feels that way			1
in a larger sense , we have been victimized by the random , hate - filled violence that steals lives and futures in this country daily			1
perhaps it is no coincidence that this hateful attack occurs at @entity4			0
it surely threatens @entity3 ' sense of security and multiplies the fear that we are persecuted			1
i wish , however , that you could know of the loving calls i am receiving from friends and clergy all over the wider metropolitan area and indeed around the world			0
our neighbors : jews , @entity34 and @entity35 are outraged that senseless murder would be aimed at our community			1
we live among friends , and that is very different from @entity40 's @entity39 , @entity41 or any other place in which @entity3 have suffered persecution			1
we are being singled out , but in a larger sense we are not , because this is no longer a unique act of terror			2
rather , the scourge of violence in @entity49 threatens us all			1
those who hate as a way of life must be rooted out , isolated and punished			2
as @entity3 , we are no strangers to violence or wanton hatred			1
many of us grew up with the fear of persecution			0
but we are not alone , either in our suffering or in our fears			0
our newspapers report daily murderous acts against one group or another : blacks , gays , children , @entity35 , minorities of all sorts			0
many of the perpetrators are not sane ; many of the victims are unsuspecting			0
the more proximate we are to the event , as the @entity3 of @entity9 were on sunday , the more vulnerable and violated we feel			1
but look at the reality			0
at least two of those killed were not the apparent intended targets : jewish people			0
they attended a nearby methodist church			0
they were , tragically , in the line of fire because they had come to the @entity83 to be part of an event , further evidence that this nation does not single us out as a hated minority but accepts us as beloved members of society and friends			2
rather , our fear and our concern should be directed at a society that will not spend the resources to provide care for the mentally ill , will not limit the means by which violence is perpetrated and does not share common social purpose sufficient to protect us all from these random killings			1
for that , we are all guilty			2
we need to search our souls to ask why we , as a society , allow these daily murders to continue			2
on sunday , @entity3 were apparently singled out			1
tomorrow , it could well be another group , and @entity9 will recede in memory			0
but the truth is that we are all bound by our human experience and the tragic violence that is overwhelming the @entity49 , ending lives and destroying families			1
our prayers are with the victims and their families			0
they must be our main concern , as well as those who feel threatened by random violence			2
sunday demonstrated that any of us could be singled out , and therefore we see we are one people that must be united in our conviction that we will not tolerate the hatred that murders innocent people and tears at the body of our nation .			0

@entity128 : shootings point to **culture** of hate - filled violence tolerated in @entity49
he says incident threatens @entity3 but also shows *bolstering* support of larger community
he says wanton hate in @entity49 *affects* many ; at least two of those targeted were not @entity3
@entity128 : society is guilty ; it should address *weapons* , mental *health* and **culture** of violence
