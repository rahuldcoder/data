-- a former @entity2 naval chief appeared in a @entity4 court friday accused of being a drug kingpin involved in smuggling cocaine from @entity8 paramilitaries into the @entity9			1
rear adm. @entity10 , once head of @entity12 's navy , was seized on a boat on the @entity14 by officials from the @entity16			1
four other @entity12 citizens -- @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 -- have also been detained			0
two more men , @entity23 and @entity24 , both @entity25 , were arrested in a related operation friday in @entity25			2
they remain there pending extradition to the @entity9			0
the five @entity2 men appeared in a @entity9 magistrate @entity30 in @entity4 friday			2
@entity16 administrator @entity32 said the arrests were " significant victories " against terrorism and international drug trafficking			0
" alleged narco - terrorists such as these , who traffic drugs in @entity2 and elsewhere , are some of the world 's most violent and brutal criminals , " she said in a @entity16 statement			1
" they have no respect for borders , and no regard for either the rule of law or who they harm as a result of their criminal endeavors			0
" according to the @entity16 , @entity54 , @entity20 and @entity55 all face charges of conspiracy to import narcotics into the @entity9			1
if found guilty , they could face life in prison			0
@entity54 was designated a drug kingpin by the @entity62 in 2010 , at which point he was chief of staff of @entity12 's navy			2
he was subsequently arrested over his alleged involvement in an attempted coup in 2011 and then freed after another coup in 2012			0
the two @entity25 , along with @entity18 and @entity19 , were charged with conspiring to engage in narco - terrorism ; conspiring to import narcotics into the @entity9 ; and conspiring to provide aid to the @entity71 , or @entity71 , as the guerrilla group is commonly known , by storing @entity71 - owned cocaine in @entity2			1
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity23 were also charged with conspiring to sell weapons , including surface - to - air missiles , to be used to protect @entity71 cocaine processing operations in @entity25 against @entity9 military forces			1
the arrests were the culmination of a long - standing undercover operation in @entity12 and elsewhere , the @entity16 said			1
@entity54 , @entity20 and @entity55 were detained tuesday in international waters near @entity82 , off the @entity2 coast , the @entity16 said , while @entity18 and @entity19 were arrested in a @entity2 nation two days later and handed over to @entity9 authorities			1
they were then flown to the @entity9			0
@entity12 , a small coastal nation of about 1.6 million people sandwiched between @entity88 and @entity12 , has been wracked by successive coups and attempted coups since it gained independence from @entity92 in 1974			0
the current transitional government took over after the last military - backed coup in april 2012			0
a @entity96 report in 2011 highlighted @entity2 's growing role in the international drugs trade -- and put @entity12 at the center of that illegal activity			1
" due to its lack of law enforcement capabilities , its susceptibility to corruption , its porous borders , and its strategic location , @entity12 remains a significant hub of narcotics trafficking on the verge of developing into a narco - state , " the report said			2
" while many officials within the @entity115 recognize the extent of the drug problem and express a willingness to address it , a crippling lack of resources and capacity remains a hindrance to real progress in combating drug trafficking			0
" the report pointed to @entity123 's then - position as navy chief as " likely to further entrench drug cartels in the permissive operating conditions prevailing in @entity12			1
" according to the indictment unsealed friday in @entity4 , @entity131 , @entity19 , @entity23 and @entity24 " agreed to receive and store multi-ton shipments of @entity71 - owned cocaine in @entity12 " where it would be held before being shipped to the @entity9			1
once there , it would be sold for the @entity71 's gain			0
the defendants also agreed that " a portion of the cocaine would be used to pay @entity12 government officials for providing safe passage for the cocaine through @entity12			0
" @entity54 , in discussions with undercover @entity16 sources , allegedly noted that it would be a good time to carry out the plan because the @entity12 government was weak after the recent coup			1
he allegedly offered to use a company he owned to help with the plan and said his fee would be $ 1 million per 1,000 kilograms of cocaine received in @entity12 , the indictment said			2
the @entity71 , designated a foreign terrorist organization by the @entity9 , and the @entity25 government have been at war since the 1960s			1
though it began as an insurgency and continues to champion leftist causes , the @entity71 is sometimes criticized for eschewing its beliefs in favor of running drugs			0
@entity25 is one of the world 's top cocaine producers , and the @entity71 is thought to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the illicit trade each year			2
the five @entity2 suspects are due back in court later this month .			0
