-- for @entity2 , there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in @entity6 in @entity8 , the choice was made for him in 1933 , when he was just a child			1
born in @entity9 , @entity2 lived a comfortable , upper - middle class life in @entity11			1
his father , @entity12 , was a loyal and patriotic @entity13 who had fought in @entity15 and was a decorated officer in the @entity13 army			0
he was also a successful doctor , leaving @entity2 with few worries during his childhood in @entity11			1
like many of his schoolmates , @entity2 was an avid soccer player who gave little thought to the political storm brewing around him			1
everything changed in 1933 when @entity25 and the @entity26 came to power			0
that the @entity2 family was successful , educated and loyal @entity13 no longer meant anything			1
to the new @entity13 government , the @entity30 were @entity32 -- and that was all that mattered			0
still , the family remained in a state on denial about the danger they faced because , as @entity2 later said , " for us , the oppression came gradually , not all at once			1
" the @entity2 's longtime nanny , a mother figure to young @entity2 , was forced to leave because of a government edict prohibiting non-jewish germans from working in @entity32 homes			1
then , @entity2 ' father was told he could no longer treat @entity47 patients			2
shortly thereafter , the elder @entity2 was summarily fired from his job in the pediatrics department of a prominent @entity11 hospital			2
as a result , the @entity2 family was forced to move from their comfortable home to a poorer part of the city			1
" it was little things at first , and people would say , ' well , we can live with that , ' and then another more stringent law would pass and people would say , ' this is n't ideal , but things will get better , ' " @entity2 said			2
by 1937 , @entity2 's father had no illusions about what was happening			2
he left @entity9 for the @entity67 via @entity68 with the help of old friends from an @entity71			1
the elder @entity2 had worked with them on health issues related to childhood poverty in @entity9 after @entity15 as soon as he was able , @entity2 ' father sent for his family			1
" he told my mother to forget the furniture and pack up what she could and get out , " @entity2 said			2
in may 1939 , @entity2 , his sister and their mother entered the @entity67 as refugees			1
four months later , the @entity13 invaded @entity83			0
" the reason so many @entity13 @entity32 did n't leave when they had the chance was because they could n't believe what was happening , " @entity2 said			2
" they thought @entity25 would get what he wanted and there would be no war and things would get back to normal			0
the holocaust was unimaginable at the time			0
" despite their escape , @entity2 said his father was never the same			2
the whole experience " broke him , spiritually and physically , " he said			0
by 1944 , the war was raging in @entity6 and 18 - year - old @entity2 was attending high school in the @entity67			1
he was raring to join the fight			0
and he admits his family 's tragic experience was only part of the motivation			0
" i could n't wait to get away from home , " he said			0
an adventurous spirit mixed with a touch of wanderlust led him to enlist in the @entity109			1
" even then i knew the historical significance of the war and i wanted to be a part of it , " he said			0
" i had a personal reason to fight the @entity115 that most @entity67 did n't			1
" @entity2 was assigned to the @entity109 's @entity116			1
he was worried he might be shipped off to the @entity117 , but fate was on his side -- pvt. @entity2 was sent to @entity120 , where he faced his former countrymen in battle			2
@entity2 said he tried not to dwell on the fact that he was fighting his former friends			2
" as long as i was just an infantryman , they were shooting at us , we were shooting at them , that 's all you think about , " he said			0
once the @entity109 found out @entity2 spoke fluent @entity13 , his commanders created a new job for him			1
at the end of the war , @entity2 was tasked with finding members of the @entity26 who were thought to be cooking up a post-war insurgency			1
" every town and village i went to , " @entity2 said , " i would be told , ' no , i 'm not a @entity26			2
but my neighbor , he 's a @entity26 , ' and then the neighbor would say , ' no , no , no. i 'm not a @entity26			0
' there was n't a @entity26 left in @entity9			2
" after some villagers led @entity2 to an elderly blind man who was proud to admit his affiliation with the @entity26 , @entity2 returned to his headquarters and proclaimed , " i found the only @entity26 in @entity9 ! " @entity2 may have harbored resentment toward the people who betrayed his family and allowed the murder of 6 million jews , but on a personal , face - to - face level , he found it difficult to hate them			1
" you have to understand , the average @entity13 may have known what the @entity115 were up to , but i think most of them were just trying to survive , " he said			0
" you would go to some of these bombed - out villages and they had suffered so much , i could n't hate them			0
it was n't like they were the @entity161 or the @entity162			0
... we had no pity for the ss. those were the real bastards			0
" @entity2 left the @entity109 soon after the war 's end , but he was n't finished fighting			1
he joined the @entity170 and led an anti-tank crew during the @entity172			1
he was later recalled by the @entity109 to serve in the @entity173			1
instead of going to the front lines , however , he was assigned to run an @entity109 newspaper out of the @entity176 in @entity177			0
upon leaving the @entity109 , he became a career journalist working for the @entity179 and the @entity180 , and as a science writer and a communications director at @entity183			0
and age has n't stopped @entity2 from pounding away at the keyboard			0
he still writes for several different publications , including the @entity187 and @entity188			0
after all these years , @entity2 is philosophical about his family 's escape from certain death at the hands of the @entity115 , and his time as an infantryman at war			1
" there were a number of instances in my life where by all the odds i should have been killed , " he said			0
" it just gives me a sense of the utter random chance of life			0

@entity2 fled @entity9 with his family for @entity67
at 18 , he enlisted in the @entity109 to fight against his *homeland*
after the war , he joined the @entity170 and led an anti-tank crew
he was later recalled by the @entity109 to serve in the @entity173
