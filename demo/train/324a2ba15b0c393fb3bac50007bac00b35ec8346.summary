-- " any time you 're around greatness , like i was for six years , and you see it at close quarters , you 're asked about it			2
" @entity9 ' former swing coach @entity8 says it happens wherever he goes			1
with the former world no. 1 back in the headlines for the right reasons , the publication of " @entity15 : my years coaching @entity9 " is @entity8 's chance to tell a few more people			1
@entity8 joined @entity9 ' team in 2004 and knew he 'd " catch some flack " for penning the book , but he wanted to share his memories of a person he describes as very complex			1
" i mean very , very complex			2
he 's an incredible champion			0
you know , he 's different			0
but i expected that , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity25			1
" i mean , when you see somebody that 's as great as @entity9 , there 's probably a reason for it			1
and you would n't expect him to be the same as everyone else			0
" @entity8 spent over 100 days in the company of @entity9 every year , even staying at his @entity37 home on occasions			1
with regular phone conversations , it amounted to the closest relationship @entity8 has ever had with a player			1
but they were never really close , according to @entity8			1
" @entity9 is pretty closed off			1
you do n't really get a lot of communication from him , or deep conversations , " he said			0
the book reflects " exactly what happened " during their time together right down to publication of some text messages @entity8 sent to @entity9			1
" i feel like i 've been a great friend to you			0
i do n't feel like i 've gotten that in return , " reads one			0
it 's a move which has come in for criticism from some fellow coaches			0
@entity59 , former coach of @entity60 , recently said : " i 'd rather be broke and not have a penny to my name before i violate the code of player / teacher confidentiality			2
for all the guys who 've committed their lives to teaching , this should be very upsetting			0
" but @entity8 rejects charges of betrayal saying the book is honest and fair			1
" those rules are not written rules			0
those might be rules that @entity59 and obviously some other people think are rules			0
but i was n't bound by any agreement			0
i did n't violate any agreement , " @entity8 said			1
the " great friend " text was sent when he resigned and reflects what @entity8 believes to be the truth			1
" i always gave an answer that was in the best interest of @entity9			1
and i did n't feel like that happened in return , " @entity8 said			1
but there was n't one single thing which made him want to terminate their relationship			0
" we had a great time together			2
@entity9 won a lot of tournaments			1
he won 45 % of his tournaments the last three years i worked with him , " @entity8 said			1
" it was just time for me to go			2
you know , i had a great time			2
it was the greatest opportunity a coach or teacher could have			2
i 'm very thankful for it			0
" @entity8 was " shocked " when the scandal about @entity9 ' personal life broke in november 2009			1
" i did n't know anything			0
@entity106 , his caddy , did n't know anything			0
and obviously @entity108 , @entity9 's wife at the time , did n't know anything , " he said			1
" i do n't think it would be my place necessarily as a coach ( to have said something ) , but it would be my place , i feel like , as a friend			2
i certainly would have said something and i know @entity106 would have said something too			0
" @entity8 detects that a post-scandal @entity9 may have " softened " but says he 's getting back to his best			1
" he 's definitely striking the ball well			0
i mean , he finished first in greens in regulation , which for the years that i worked with @entity9 , i thought that was a key statistic			1
he was always first in greens in regulation , or near the top			0
" but it 's his recent improvement on the greens which @entity8 thinks will be key to success in the coming weeks			1
" the great thing about @entity128 to me was that his putting was good			2
he finished fourth in putting			2
that 's a key statistic			0
every player that 's won on the @entity134 this year has finished top 10 in putting , " he said			2
" and going to @entity136 , that 's the most important thing			0
@entity9 would have won five or six green jackets in a row if he would have fewer than , you know , two three - putts for the 72 holes			2
" so if he can avoid three - putts at @entity136 , he 'll be very difficult to beat			0
he 's great on that golf course			0
