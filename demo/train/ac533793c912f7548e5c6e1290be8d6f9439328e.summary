-- @entity3 striking legend @entity1 scored his 70th @entity5 goal to help @entity6 to a superb 5 - 2 @entity8 victory over holders @entity9 in their quarterfinal first leg			1
an extraordinary match began in remarkable fashion when @entity9 took the lead after just 27 seconds			0
@entity6 goalkeeper @entity14 raced out of his area to head away an @entity9 attack , but he left his goal unguarded as @entity18 fired the ball home from the halfway line with stunning accuracy for one of the goals of the season			1
however , the @entity28 @entity27 side levelled in the 17th minute when @entity9 failed to deal with a corner and @entity30 was given space to blast the ball home			1
the tie swung @entity9 's way again in the 34th minute when they re-took the lead , @entity36 -- the hero of last year 's final win over @entity39 -- volleying home unmarked from close range after @entity41 cushioned his header back across goal from the @entity9 right			0
but that advantage lasted for just six minutes before @entity45 netted on the rebound from a tight angle after goalkeeper @entity48 only parried his initial weak effort			0
the visitors took the lead for the first time eight minutes after the break when @entity1 held off @entity52 to fire past @entity48 -- and they increased their advantage four minutes later as defender @entity52 diverted @entity55 's cross into his own net			2
the home side 's hard task was made almost impossible when they had defender @entity59 sent off in the 62nd minute for a second yellow card			2
@entity6 continued to pour forward , looking to kill the tie off			0
@entity55 struck the post with a low shot and @entity64 also hit the woodwork from close range			0
but a fifth goal was not long in coming and @entity6 surely made the second leg in @entity69 irrelevant with 15 minutes remaining when @entity45 turned and curled home a remarkable fifth goal .			1

@entity6 stun @entity9 5 - 2 in a remarkable @entity5 quarterfinal
@entity1 scores his 70th @entity5 goal to give the visitors a huge advantage
