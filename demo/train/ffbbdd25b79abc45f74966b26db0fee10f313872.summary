-- while on a television program several years ago , i recounted a story about moving with my family into a new home in the suburbs of @entity7			0
as a black family , we were welcomed to the neighborhood with a shocking sight			0
my mother and i looked out the kitchen window the morning after we moved in to notice that someone had driven across our new lawn , skidding over mom 's cute dogwood tree , and placed a cross there to intimidate us			2
not being wanted in this neighborhood based on the color of our skin made a fearful and lasting impression on me as a 9 - year old			0
about a week after the show a letter came to my office			0
penned by a man who identified himself as a " @entity28 , " the letter was a fiery missal responding to my television appearance and underscoring his disdain for black people and his glee over the fact that i had a " burning cross " ( i never said it was burning ) in my front yard			0
i have this letter posted on the back of my office door with a note i wrote across it with a black sharpie : " this is why @entity43 has called us to be gracists and ambassadors of reconciliation ! " as whites become minorities in @entity51 , traditional minority groups like mine will be called upon to graciously build bridges to help whites adjust to their new minority status without malice or vengeance			1
diversity is an ever - evolving , rotating movement of new people and new perspectives in @entity51			1
while the term may have been largely about blacks at one time , and more recently , latinos , we find @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 filling up the melting pot. in some areas of the country , as in @entity71 , it 's the burgeoning @entity72 population , or in @entity73 and @entity74 , the growing populations of @entity76			2
diversity is here to stay			2
welcome to the realization of the rev. @entity79 's dream			1
yet , when @entity79 gave his " @entity81 " speech , i wonder if he ever envisioned a day when whites in @entity51 would actually be the minority			1
judging people by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin is altogether as important as it is for blacks			0
this will become increasingly the case in the decades to come			2
integrating whites into the mosaic of @entity51 society is an important ideal to embrace , because integration has always been construed as mixing other minorities into a white - dominated world			1
whites will become a minority within three decades , according to the @entity103			1
if this happens as predicted , within little more than one generation , whites will be the largest minority group in @entity51			1
in the @entity51 we are in for a new age of diversity that all @entity51 should be aware of with eyes wide open			1
for the first time in @entity51 history , the majority rule of whites will be threatened , which means the concept of rugged individualism that worked so well for whites in @entity51 in centuries past may be threatened			1
the rules of personal responsibility and relational networking ( some call it the " good old boy " network ) as an avenue for success will no longer be sufficient in a multicultural and global society			0
i predict the new minority whites will break into at least two groups : diverse whites , those who are culturally aware and multiculturally proficient , and reverse whites , those who will fight doggedly to hold on to whatever superior status they can			1
other minorities , especially blacks , have a choice to be what i call " gracists , " people who extend favor , kindness , forgiveness and grace to others regardless of , and sometimes because of , color , class or culture			1
whites will have the choice of retreating into fear and loathing or embracing their new status with understanding and grace			1
the integration of whites is not their sole responsibility			0
@entity161 is the powerful assertion that each group should extend grace toward other groups , including minorities extending it to their former oppressor and whites extending it to others rather than protectionism out of fear			1
the more perfect union will become a reality if that union of gracists will realize that the dream of the rev. @entity79 extends to all multicultural configurations and presupposes the coming together of all people as equally human			1
the factional system of dysfunctional diversity , where power structures are reserved for a majority race to dominate others , is being dismantled one generation at a time			0
the mosaic of more @entity51 sharing power beyond one or two dominating racial groups will demand new partnerships based on sociological - political ideas that will drive robust debates , giving birth to innovation and collaboration			1
the ugly beast of race baiting and power hoarding will not easily die , at least not without a vitriolic fight			0
in the not - so - distant future , we can expect that diverse whites and reverse whites will be at odds			0
@entity206 must be present to step into the divide and integrate them both			0
reverse whites who want to go back to the way things were will still write letters applauding fear mongering			0
white interest groups may subversively advocate for sustaining institutional structures that perpetuate inequality			0
the fear of loss of racial dominance may give birth to a growing number of whites feeling cultural disequilibrium			2
but diversity is here to stay			0
unity has a chance at being our destiny			0
if we enter into this brave new world with a spirit of grace , our success as a multicultural , multi-ethnic nation will be a dream realized			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			2

@entity238 : @entity51 sees diversity in many forms
he says few realize that whites in @entity51 will become a minority group in 3 decades
@entity238 says some may react well ; others may mourn loss of privileged status
he says @entity51 have the choice to extend grace to each other , realizing @entity79 's dream
