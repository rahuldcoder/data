a transgender rights group announced wednesday that it has filed a discrimination complaint in @entity2 on behalf of a first - grader who was born a boy but identifies as a girl			1
the filing stems from a decision announced last december by officials at @entity9 that @entity10 could no longer use the girls ' bathroom at @entity13			1
mother @entity14 said she and her husband were shocked			0
" we were very confused because everything was going so well , and they had been so accepting , and all of a sudden it changed and it was very confusing and very upsetting because we knew that , by doing that , she was going to go back to being unhappy , " she told @entity16			0
" it was going to set her up for a lot of bad things			0
" @entity10 was born with male sex organs but has identified as female since she could express herself , her mother said			1
the child had attended classes during her kindergarten year with no problems and no complaints from anyone at the school , @entity10 told reporters at the @entity35 in @entity36 , where she was flanked by her husband , @entity38 , and four other children			1
wearing a girl 's winter coat , @entity10 stood behind her mother			1
afraid bullies would make fun of her daughter , @entity14 said she pulled @entity10 out of school during winter break			1
" in the end , we just want what is the best for @entity10 , " @entity10 said about the complaint			1
" we want her to be able to go back to school and be treated equally without discrimination and harassment			2
" attorney @entity54 of the @entity55 , which is representing @entity10 , said the complaint -- which was filed with the @entity57 -- is intended to have an impact beyond a single family or school			1
" for many transgender people , discrimination is a daily part of life			0
unfortunately for @entity10 , it has started very early , " he said , adding that the complaint is a " test of @entity2 's @entity68			1
" " the world is going to be looking at the school , " he said , which can " send a message to the world and teach tolerance , fair play and equal rights			2
" a girl 's life for most of the past year , @entity10 has dressed as a girl			1
@entity10 's passport and state - issued identification recognize her as female			1
transgender kids : painful quest to be who they are @entity14 said she got a call " @entity96 " from the school in december saying that @entity10 could use the boys ' bathroom , gender - neutral faculty bathrooms or the nurse 's bathroom , but not the girls ' facilities			1
the district " took into account not only @entity10 , but other students in the building , their parents and the future impact a boy with male genitals using a girls ' bathroom would have as @entity10 grew older , " a letter the family 's attorney received in december said			1
" however , i 'm certain you can appreciate that , as @entity10 grows older and his male genitals develop along with the rest of his body , at least some parents and students are likely to become uncomfortable with his continued use of the girls ' restroom			1
" in a statement tuesday , the district 's attorney , @entity121 , said : " the district firmly believes it has acted reasonably and fairly with respect to this issue			1
however , the district believes the appropriate and proper forum for discussing the issues identified in the charge is through the @entity132 process			1
the district is preparing a response to the charge which it will submit to the division			2
therefore , the district will not comment further on this matter out of respect for the process which the parents have initiated			1
" " it 's sad that the @entity10 family had to file a civil rights complaint in order for their daughter to be treated equally , " said @entity142 , president of the @entity143 , in a statement			1
" the students clearly are n't the only people at this school who need more education			2
" a little - studied group transgender children experience a disconnect between their sex , which is based on their anatomy , and their gender , which includes behaviors , roles and activities , experts say			0
for the general public , transgender identity may be a new concept , though many might recall @entity169 , the child of entertainers @entity171 and @entity172			0
born female , @entity169 underwent a transition in his 40s to become a man			0
he wrote in his book " transition " that , even as a child , he had been " aware of a part of me that did not fit			0
" he appeared last year as a man on " @entity184 , " in part , he said , to destigmatize being transgender			0
being transgender no longer a mental ' disorder ' in diagnostic manual @entity191 data and studies about transgender children are rare			2
international studies have estimated that anywhere from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 1,000 people are transgender			0
some children as young as age 3 show early signs of gender dysphoria or gender identity disorder , mental health experts who work with transgender children say			0
these children are not intersex -- they do not have a physical disorder or malformation of their sexual organs			0
the gender issue exists in the brain , though experts do not agree on whether it 's psychologically or physiologically based			2
many transgender people report feeling discomfort with their gender as early as they can remember			0
transgender job seekers face uphill battle gender identity is often confused with sexual orientation			0
the difference is that " gender identity is who you are , and sexual orientation is who you want to have sex with , " said dr. @entity227 , a professor of clinical pediatrics at the @entity229 , who treats transgender children			0
children around age 3 are probably not interested in sexual orientation , she said			0
but experts say some children who look like they will be transgender in early childhood turn out to be gay , lesbian or bisexual			0
differences in schools school policies toward transgender students vary across the @entity242			2
in @entity245 , for example , the law says students ca n't be discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity			0
but in @entity250 , a court ruled in november that a school district did not violate a transgender student 's rights when she was told she could n't use the girls ' bathroom			1
gender nonconformity is not a disorder , group says dude , the @entity2 school district 's attorney , has said there is nothing in that state requiring public schools to permit transgender students to use restrooms intended for the gender with which they identify			1
he added that the @entity9 adheres to the @entity268 in all respects : " @entity10 attends class as all other students , is permitted to wear girls ' clothes and is referred to as the parents have requested			1
" she also has easy access to bathrooms other than the girls ' , @entity121 said			2
@entity10 's case will be the first to challenge a restroom restriction under the state 's anti-discrimination act , the @entity55 said			1
for now , the first - grader is being home - schooled			0
girl scouts accept transgender kid , provoking cookie boycott reaction to @entity10 's story @entity16 's online audience has responded to this story with a range of questions and comments , with many saying the child is too young to comprehend gender differences			1
mostly , posters said they felt sorrow for @entity10 as a child who is struggling			2
" just let the kid use the gender - neutral bathrooms			0
when he / she is a teen , if he is still convinced he is a girl , maybe then you can get into it with the school , " said commenter @entity302			2
" this kid is going to have a hard enough life if he really is transsexual , why start fighting battles now , when he should just be blissfully ignorant " ? transgender teacher sues school for alleged discrimination @entity314 said the story left a " negative impression of the parents			2
" " my rash view may be unfair , but i remember being that age and have helped raise 9 nieces and nephews			0
one wanted to be a firetruck and ran around making truck noises			0
another one of the boys liked to play dress up with the girls , " @entity314 wrote			2
" my fiance 's little brother always wore dresses as well			0
but , at the end of the day , the parents are there to be the adults and make decisions for them			0
" i also am a little weary when you read a story where the parents are filing lawsuits for their 6 year old child 's rights			2
" editor 's note : a previous version of this story quoted certain reader comments that were harshly critical of @entity10 's parents			1
we removed these comments because we decided they did not increase understanding of this complex and personal issue .			0
