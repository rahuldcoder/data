a couple of weeks ago , the rally cry that had been bubbling in the wake of " @entity2 " suddenly grew louder			0
@entity5 , editor - in - chief of @entity6 and one of the most impassioned , trustworthy voices out there when it comes to politics and civil liberties , started a petition			0
visit @entity14 and you 'll see that it 's gathered more than 272,000 signatures already and counting			0
its call to action : a plea to the @entity21 government to grant pardons to the estimated 49,000 men who were convicted under the @entity21 's anti-gay laws , just as @entity25 -- the computer scientist and @entity27 codebreaker -- was in the 1950s			1
truth be told , most apologies given would be posthumous like the one @entity25 received from @entity29 and @entity30 a few years back			2
but to ignore the injustice they all suffered just because they 're not there to hear us is to ignore history , do further injustice to their families , and that 's something we quite simply can not do			1
hearing of the overwhelming response that @entity5 's petition was receiving , outspoken gay actor / comedian @entity41 echoed the sentiment at a @entity46 screening of the film			0
members of @entity25 's family and the movie 's cast joined @entity41 in drafting an open letter to @entity21 's political leaders , including @entity54 , as well as the @entity55 and @entity56 -- insisting that those men deserved to have the stains of criminal conviction removed from their names			1
@entity61 , who so exquisitely plays @entity25 in the movie , said it best perhaps : " @entity25 was not only prosecuted , but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early , by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved , as all human beings do			2
sixty years later , that same government claimed to " forgive " him by pardoning him			0
i find this deplorable , because @entity25 's actions did not warrant forgiveness -- theirs did -- and the 49,000 other prosecuted men deserve the same			1
" indeed , part of what makes telling @entity25 's story so important is that thousands like him experienced the same cruelty as he did , enduring relentless discrimination simply for attempting to live complete , fulfilled lives			1
i 've been a huge supporter of " @entity2 " from before its premiere and see it as this year 's best film because , as i said , it so poignantly reminds us that we can not ignore history			1
in minority communities like ours , we look to stories of legendary role models like @entity25 or @entity98 for inspiration			2
instead of relying on oral traditions from family or friends , we must look to historians , artists , authors and moviemakers to help ensure that we remember where we came from			0
the heroes of our movement , alive or dead , are there to remind us of what we still need to strive towards			0
@entity25 's many achievements should have earned him royal accolades in the @entity21			1
his impact warranted no less than a @entity115 or @entity116 on this side of the @entity118			0
the work he did helped to defeat the spread of fascism , and yet in return , the government took away his freedom			1
his persecution at the hands of their laws ended his life with pain and suffering			0
that same injustice was shared by close to 50,000 of our @entity133 forebears , who selflessly accomplished feats that benefit us still today			2
" @entity2 " and efforts inspired by it , like @entity5 's petition , guarantee that @entity25 and men like him wo n't ever be forgotten .			2

campaign grows to force @entity21 government to pardon 49,000 men convicted under anti-gay laws
@entity133 *campaigner* @entity146 says story of @entity27 codebreaker @entity25 reminds us we can not ignore history
@entity146 : @entity151 did helped defeat fascism , and yet in return , @entity21 government took away his freedom
