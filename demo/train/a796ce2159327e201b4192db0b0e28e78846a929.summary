-- @entity2 , the bald and beetle - browed rascal hero of " @entity5 , " is an infectious imp â € ” as voiced by @entity7 , he 's like @entity8 with the personality of @entity10			1
but in the first " @entity5 " ( 2010 ) , he was a supervillain with a grand plan ( he wanted to steal the moon ) , and in the surprisingly toothless sequel , he has been neutered into a boring nice guy			1
the co-directors , @entity18 and @entity19 , create a seductively tactile computer - animated landscape in which gentle slapstick rules the day			2
for some reason , though , they have mostly left out the flashes of egomaniacal dastardliness that even a movie for kids can thrive on ( e.g. , the far superior @entity28 animation @entity29 )			0
@entity30 voices @entity31 , the @entity32 agent who has a crush on @entity2 and recruits him to be a spy			1
you keep waiting for @entity30 to display some of her flaked - out inspiration , but she , too , has been given almost nothing to play but sweetness and light			0
the best thing in the movie is the army of chattery yellow minions who are injected with a serum that transforms them into gnashing purple beasties			2
by the end , every child in the audience will want his or her own monster - minion toy			0
adults will just regret the way that " @entity5 " betrays the original film 's devotion to bad - guy gaiety			1
