-- deep in a remote , hot , dry patch of northwestern @entity3 lies one of the earliest detectable signs of life on the planet , tracing back nearly 3.5 billion years , scientists say			1
at that time , the @entity8 -- relatively speaking -- was n't into its adulthood yet			2
scientists estimate the planet formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago ; minerals known as zircons , indicating water , and continents existed within 100 million and 200 million years after that on what was still a scalding planet			1
the existence of water suggests that life was possible			0
but what did it look like , and when did it start ? the discovery from the @entity24 , a much examined outcrop of rocks in @entity3 's @entity27 , documented in a paper published online this week in the @entity30 journal may help answer those questions			2
new species discovered in @entity34 rainforest it centers on something called microbially induced sedimentary structures , commonly shortened to the acronym miss. it 's a mouthful to many , but some scientists believe this phenomenon could be the key to finding the first demonstrable evidence of life			1
a miss forms via a process involving microorganisms ( found in what 's called microbial mats ) with rocks ( or sediment ) , something that can only happens under certain conditions			2
as the study 's lead author , @entity54 of @entity55 , notes , " the signal of early life forms has been preserved more clearly in @entity58 " compared with other prehistoric finds			0
another unique thing about them , unlike some other geological phenomena , is that a miss structure formed a few billion years ago can look much like one a few hundred - thousand years old			1
yet another is that it can show not just evidence of one organism but an entire ecosystem , one in which living things coexisted with one another			2
that 's exactly what the study 's co-authors -- @entity54 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 -- say they found in @entity3 , noting that " this miss displays the same associations that are known from modern as well as fossil " finds			1
the miss also shows microbes that act like " modern cyanobacteria , " which the co-authors explain are " known to be the first oxygen - producing organisms in the fossil record			0
" given all that , the scientists write : " we conclude that the miss in the @entity24 record a complex microbial ecosystem , hitherto unknown , and represent one of the most ancient signs of life on @entity8			1
" ancient @entity97 coins that could change history of @entity3 the fact this find was in @entity3 is no accident			2
the area has long been a treasure trove for @entity8 scientists delving into the past			1
stromatolites found in @entity107 trace back about 3.45 billion years , while microfossils from @entity109 go back to 3.47 billion years , notes @entity111 scientist @entity110			1
" the @entity24 is the oldest rock succession of sedimentary rocks that was never affected by any tectonics , " or big changes in the surface caused by earthquakes and the like , said @entity54			0
" those rocks were just sitting there , nothing ever happened to them			0
that means any life is nicely preserved			0
" the oldest miss previously known , though , came from @entity125 and dated to 3.2 billion years ago			1
that 's young relative to the @entity128 find , which the @entity30 report says is about 3.48 billion years old			1
20 @entity3 discoveries the fact this miss from @entity3 has a very similar makeup to recent ones is telling , @entity54 said			2
a pessimist may see this as indication that there 's been little evolution in that respect over that very considerable stretch of time			0
on the flip side , this shows that things were pretty complex even way back then			0
" it was not that individual cell that was fighting for itself , " @entity54 said			0
" it was intelligent enough to function in this environment very , very successfully			0
if cells work together , they have access to a larger set of experiences			0
" the @entity3 discovery features " a complex system of microbial mats , " which are " complex communities of microbes " -- or extremely small living things -- " usually organized into layers that can be seen with the naked eye , " notes @entity163			1
" they were one of the earliest ecosystems on @entity8			0
" the @entity167 space agency is interested in @entity58 and microbial mats because scientists are looking for them on @entity170 to possibly show life once existed there			1
the @entity3 discovery could help in that regard , the latest study 's authors point out , especially give " the similarity of the early history of @entity8 and the early history of @entity170			1
" " if there was life , " said @entity54 , " then @entity58 is one of the likely targets			0
" @entity185 ' @entity184 unicorn ' caught on camera			0

new : discovery shows life was fairly complex 3.48 billion years ago , scientist says
scientists : structures found in @entity3 featured " a complex microbial ecosystem "
that makes it the oldest miss ever and " one of the most ancient signs of life on @entity8 "
scientists have been looking for such structures , as evidence of life , on @entity170
