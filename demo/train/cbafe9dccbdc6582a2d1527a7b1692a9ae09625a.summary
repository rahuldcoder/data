@entity0 -- the @entity3 newspaper at the center of a censorship storm hit newsstands in the capital thursday for the first time since journalists went on strike in protest against apparent editorial interference from the government			1
however , the @entity13 was not widely available in southern @entity15 province , where it is published			1
the controversy surfaced last week when a group of former @entity13 journalists said , in an open letter , that a local propaganda chief had dramatically altered the paper 's traditional @entity23 message , which had called for certain reforms and greater respect for constitutional rights			1
while newspapers in @entity3 are often subject to censorship , the journalists wrote in the letter that the changes , which included praise for the @entity33 , were excessive and took place after editors had signed off on the final proofs			1
@entity37 , a @entity3 writer living in @entity0 , told @entity39 's new leadership would have taken a dim view of these calls by a newspaper known for pushing the boundaries			1
" for these new bosses , what they do not need from @entity13 is that kind of advice ! just think about it , they have been waiting for this moment for a very long time and finally they are in charge			1
" they believe they know what they should do and when to do it as well as how to do it			0
they do not want to be told what to do by a local newspaper ! " but soon enough , editors , reporters and their supporters protested on the @entity67 , on social media and in front of the office complex of the embattled media group			2
protesters carried posters calling for press freedom			1
some came with flowers to " mourn the death of press freedom , " while others wore facemasks to symbolize the gagging of the media			1
even celebrities voiced their support via their micro-blogging accounts			0
@entity85 , one of the most influential contemporary writers and bloggers in @entity3 , recently wrote on his blog post : " the @entity13 has informed me a lot as a reader			2
it gives power to the weak and hope to the hopeless			0
so , in its moment of weakness and desperation , i hope we can all lend them some strength , even if just a little , and help it carry on			0
" @entity3 actor @entity101 tweeted : " i am not that deep and do n't play with words , i support the friends at @entity13			2
" others used more subtle language			0
" hoping for a spring in this harsh winter , " posted @entity106 , an actress with some 19 million followers on @entity108 , @entity3 's @entity109 - like service			2
another actress @entity112 , who has more than 31 million followers , used a quote from @entity116 dissident @entity115 : " one word of truth outweighs the whole world			0
" the street protests , although small in scale , posed a challenge to the @entity3 leaders			0
twenty or so years ago , the public would not have known of the controversy if the authorities had wished to cover it up			0
they could simply have arrested protesters as trouble makers and shut down the newspapers			2
even if it were publicly known , it would have been difficult for the embattled journalists to secure public support			0
but with an estimated 400 million internet users and some 200 million micro-bloggers , this protest gained traction			0
some media reports suggest the authorities may have reached a compromise with the protesters -- an editor may be replaced , the @entity15 propaganda chief has been absolved of responsibility , the protesters will not be harassed , and the paper will not be shut down			2
though this has still to be confirmed			0
yet the fact an earlier commentary from the @entity151 , the communist party 's official mouthpiece , was republished in thursday 's edition may support these reports			1
tucked in a small corner of the paper , it says " it 's fundamental that the party regulates the press but its method of regulation needs to be advanced and must keep pace with the times			1

@entity13 was not widely available in @entity167 where it is published
the newspaper 's journalists accused officials of heavy - handed censorship
protesters gathered outside the paper 's offices this week demanding more press freedom
thursday edition *reprinted* @entity181 's @entity151 editorial that regulation must follow times
