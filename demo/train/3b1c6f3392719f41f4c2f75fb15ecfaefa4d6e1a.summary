part of any @entity4 is the way millions of us end up watching a sport that millions of us would n't be caught dead watching under any normal circumstances			1
why , just a little while ago , i found myself reading a story that began : " @entity14 judoka @entity13 won gold in women 's 63 kilogram over @entity18 's @entity17			2
" i thought to myself , " hmmm ...			2
i do n't know what a judoka is , i do n't know what a kilogram is , and , come to think of it , i ca n't even tell you where @entity14 is			1
" and then i think : " wait a minute			2
did n't you go to @entity4 women 's judo once ? " yes , indeed i did			1
i was there when @entity30 , 25 , a 136 - pound ( not sure how many kilograms that is ) aspiring dietitian from @entity33 took second place to become the first @entity36 athlete ( man or woman ) to win a medal ( gold , silver or bronze ) in an @entity4 competition ( summer or winter )			1
@entity36 and judo , who knew ? they go together like the @entity47 and rugby , like @entity49 and ice hockey			1
i wrote about judo that day , even though i do n't know judo from jiu - jitsu from karate from taekwondo			1
i only know that you sign up your grandson for lessons , and he goes to a class at a mall			2
the women in @entity28 came out in what looked like white bathrobes			2
i saw one 's belt come loose			2
was that a point for her opponent ? i saw one go down			2
" that 's an ippon , '' i was told by the guy next to me			2
i saw a point go on the scoreboard under the word " koka			2
" it was my first time seeing an ippon go up on a koka			2
i was enjoying my first judo			1
i was n't yet ready for the @entity79 to put monday night judo on tv , but i was having a good time			1
the women grunted and groaned on the mat and appeared to be having a really bad - ass game of @entity86			2
it got pretty physical out there			2
not quite @entity90 vs. @entity91 , but definitely tough stuff			2
i got a kick out of watching them fight			2
i looked up that day 's judo results later on a computer and found the following : 19 ippons , 13 waza - aris , 22 yukos , 35 kokas , 13 shidos , three chuis , two keikokus and no hansoku - makes			1
do n't you hate it when you watch judo all day without seeing a single hansoku - make ? sports of all sorts , that 's the @entity4 in a nutshell			1
i think they 've had every kind of sport so far -- @entity112 -- except bungee jumping , elephant hunting and " celebrity apprentice			1
" the 1896 @entity116 began with king george i of greece declaring them open			2
he did not jump out of a helicopter first with @entity121			0
he did not need to listen to the " @entity123 " theme			0
he did not sit at home watching @entity125 on tv , although @entity127 knows that he probably did know a whole lot of guys named @entity125			0
swimming was part of those 1896 games			1
i doubt if any @entity134 suits were involved			0
do you know where the 1896 swim events were held ? in the bay			0
they swam in the @entity140 , not in some cool pool			0
i bet the bronze medalist would be really angry if he lost a few seconds on the clock while attempting to swim for his life from a shark			0
the 1900 @entity147 included cricket and croquet			0
it also had golf , which is being brought back for 2016			0
i am extremely excited about this , because whenever i think of an @entity4 athlete , i think of a lean , hard , buff , rock - abbed , @entity157 - like individual like @entity158			1
@entity159 also had a sport called @entity161			0
i personally love pelota , but not that @entity164 kind			0
in the first place , i believe it uses a designated hitter			0
in the second place , @entity161 is notorious for its mvps being on steroids			0
i am glad @entity161 is gone now			0
otherwise , @entity171 would probably ask @entity172 to get out there and try to play it			0
the 1904 @entity175 had sports i could comprehend			1
like tug of war , for one			1
nobody needs to explain tug of war to me			1
whichever team tugs harder wins			0
i do not know if the losing team fell face first into @entity186 mud , but i 'd like to think so			1
( by the way , although @entity188 and @entity189 usually get most of the publicity , @entity175 fans are considered by many to be the greatest tug - of - war fans in the world			1
) those 1904 @entity4 also had a sport called roque , which is a form of croquet			1
it has n't returned since , so maybe there was a scandal			1
maybe the winner got caught corking his mallet			0
i wish croquet would make a comeback in the @entity4 , particularly so the top croquet stars could end up with at least 500,000 followers on @entity208			1
i can see @entity209 becoming very good at this			0
the croquet fights alone would go over big in @entity212			0
nowadays , we have things such as archery , badminton , beach volleyball , canoe slalom , equestrian , handball , modern pentathlon and water polo that you do n't usually see on tv			1
i mean , let 's face it , there are n't a lot of archery highlights shown at 11 o'clock			1
not a lot of " @entity229			0
" not much canoe coverage for all you whitewater fantasy - league geeks			0
i have been to 11 olympics in person , yet i still have no clue what modern pentathlon is , or if there was ever old - fashioned pentathlon			1
the only archery i have witnessed between 2008 and 2012 was in " @entity239			0
" i am one of those old dudes who ca n't take synchronized swimming ( or diving ) seriously because all i can see is @entity243 doing it with @entity245			1
i just watched equestrian events on tv			0
i pull for the horses			0
i want a horse to get up on a pedestal and get a gold medal			0
i think the horse does the hard part and deserves the perks			0
i see some poor gelding about to leap over an obstacle , and i bet he 's thinking to himself : " i could jump even higher if i could get this fool off my back			0
" @entity259 is another sport you can go four years without watching once on tv			0
i know there are networks that could use a hit , so they really should consider @entity259 with masks and costumes and 250 - pound men jumping off the top rope			0
it is so cool seeing some of these obscure @entity4 sports come back to life			1
i believe the popularity of some of these sports could rise dramatically if shown more frequently on tv			1
bikini beach volleyball should be shown 23 hours a day			0
if i worked for @entity171 , for example , i would be absolutely begging the @entity277 to give serious consideration to bikini judo			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity282 .			1

@entity282 : olympics compel us to watch sports we 'd never follow
he says the rules and even *language* of sports such as judo are n't *familiar* to many in @entity47
at @entity175 games in 1904 , tug of war was an entry -- at least the rules were plain , he says
@entity282 : i 've attended 11 @entity4 and still do n't know what modern pentathlon is
