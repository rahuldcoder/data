-- the disappearance of @entity2 is an enormous tragedy for the families of the victims			1
it is excruciating to live through the pain , helplessness , shock and anger			2
it is as hard to regain some degree of normalcy			2
i know because i 've been there			2
in 1985 , my beloved father died on the @entity17 that crashed outside of @entity18 , killing more than 500 passengers and crew			1
it 's one the largest plane accidents in the history of aviation			1
sitting on the tatami mat in the city hall in the small village close to the crash site , surrounded by hundreds of other people looking for their loved ones , i felt desperate , scared and suffocated			1
contemplating another day of looking at pine wood boxes with inscriptions like , " part of left hand , possibly male , " i thought the agony would never end			1
how can i steel myself to keep on looking to try to identify some remains of what was once my dear father , hero to his family ? emotionally , physically and in every way , i felt drained of life force , like the body fragments in the boxes we were going through one by one in our search for our loved ones			1
all these years later the scars still sting when scratched , as they were when @entity2 vanished			2
i want to share with the grieving , scared and frustrated relatives of @entity2 victims that while life will never be the same , it will get better			1
it will take time , but you will laugh again and the sun will come out once more			2
the lack of closure is the hardest part			1
how do you know for sure that those on the plane are gone since their bodies have not been found ? what if they are alive somewhere waiting for you to rescue them ? how do you have a funeral when there are no remains ? how can you be so sure ? but the truth is that while you may hold out hope , the world is presuming they are gone forever			1
you have to accept it and move on			2
here are some steps that helped me recover from my loss			2
perhaps it could be of help to the families of flight 370 : 1			1
allow the pain to be released			0
cry , punch the pillows , share stories , do what you need to let the feelings out			0
from your family , friends and experts			0
from your spiritual source , in prayer or in nature			0
in time , maybe join a bereavement group			0
eat as healthy as you can			0
get rest , even if you ca n't sleep well , take some down time			0
walk , exercise , play a sport , dance , do something physical so that the feelings can be dissipated			0
nature is big enough to hold you and your grief			1
know that your loved one ( s ) are at peace and will be with you always			1
help someone who may be in a worse situation than you			0
in my case i saw that a couple of @entity129 families did n't make the trip to @entity131			1
i sent them notes to let them know that i prayed for their loved ones , and that everyone was very kind and respectful in the whole search process			0
trust that something good will come out of this tragedy			0
we may not know what it is , or how , but it will happen			0
my father 's death helped me learn how to be more present , to survive adversity , and appreciate the wonderful kindness of strangers			2
from disaster i 've learned to be strong and flexible , and to seek assistance when i need it			0
with faith and courage i can make a positive difference in other people 's lives			0
during the course of my life , i 've been fortunate to reach many of the goals i had set			2
i know that my dad was there , guiding , supporting and inspiring me the entire time			0
he smiled with pride with each new milestone that i crossed			0
i believe all of us can grow and thrive through the trials of life with peace and happiness			1
it just takes one step at a time			0
the families of flight 370 victims will come out of this tragedy different -- but they will endure and honor the memories of their loved ones			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			1
