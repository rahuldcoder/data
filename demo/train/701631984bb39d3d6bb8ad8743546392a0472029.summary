" based on all of my experience and based on all of the recommendations and the great work and the research that has been done , i am quite confident that the outcomes in these cases will be successful , " he said			0
he also expressed confidence that an impartial jury would be found " to ensure a fair trial in @entity8			0
" of the 2,752 people killed in the 9/11 attacks , 2,606 died when terrorists crashed two hijacked airliners into the @entity19 towers			1
@entity2 also announced that five other detainees held at the @entity46 military detention facility at @entity4 , @entity47 , will be sent to military commissions for trial			1
they were identified as @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			0
@entity55 is an accused mastermind of the deadly 2000 bombing of the @entity57 ; @entity50 is a @entity58 charged with the 2002 murder of a @entity46 military officer in @entity61			1
@entity50 was 15 years old when he was captured in july 2002			0
@entity2 said a venue for the military commissions has not been set			1
@entity7 " will be subject to the most exacting demands of justice , " president @entity64 said friday in @entity65			1
" the @entity46 people insist on it , and my administration will insist on it , " @entity64 told reporters at a joint news conference with @entity65 prime minister @entity70			1
@entity7 is the confessed organizer of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity8 and the @entity76			0
but his confession could be called into question during trial			0
a 2005 @entity81 memo -- released by the @entity64 administration -- revealed he had been waterboarded 183 times in march 2003			1

bringing some of the world 's top terror suspects to be tried in @entity8 has already sparked outrage , as well as security concerns			2
" @entity7 is the most wanted terrorist in the world			0
everyone in the world is going to know precisely where he is at precisely one time , " @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity104 said			0
" the @entity109 courthouse could become the focus of a great deal of interest from terrorists			2
that 's going to take a tremendous security effort			0
" @entity116 list the challenges of this trial @entity46 sen. @entity119 , @entity120 , issued a statement friday denouncing the decision to try the 9/11 suspects as " common criminals			1
" " the attacks of september 11th were an act of war , " @entity119 said			0
" reverting to a pre- 9/11 approach to fighting terrorism and bringing these dangerous individuals onto @entity46 soil needlessly compromises the safety of all @entity46			2
putting political ideology ahead of the safety of the @entity46 people just to fulfill an ill - conceived campaign promise is irresponsible			0
" @entity138 rep. @entity137 , the top @entity139 on the @entity140 , said the decision meant @entity7 and the other defendants would be able to claim new protections , including @entity144 and @entity146 rights against unreasonable search and seizure			1
" @entity46 already gives terrorists more constitutional rights than any other country , " @entity137 said			1
" the administration should not prioritize the rights of terrorists over the rights of @entity46 to be safe and secure			1
" but @entity156 , whose husband was killed on 9/11 , said she welcomed the trial			2
" some would say @entity8 would now be a target by allowing his [ @entity7 's ] trial to take place in @entity8 , but i disagree , " she told @entity1			0
@entity164 still lives in the @entity8 area			0
" it would give many of us access to attend the hearings			0
" she also said that for some who lost loved ones on 9/11 , " this will be our opportunity to see justice served and have our day in court			1
" our ability to prosecute terrorists successfully in open courtrooms has less to do with the our judicial process and more to do with @entity181 's policy on torture that will make these prosecutions more difficult , " she said			2
@entity1 justice producer @entity184 in @entity0 and @entity185 in @entity8 contributed to this report .			2
