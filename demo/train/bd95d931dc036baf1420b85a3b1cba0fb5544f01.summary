@entity0 -- a teenage stock clerk who in 1979 left @entity3 for the solace of his mother 's @entity6 home appeared shaken and then fell ill , says a relative of the man now charged in the murder of 6 - year - old @entity11			1
" when he moved home , he was really nervous and shaking all the time , " added the relative , who declined to be named			0
" he constantly had diarrhea , and he spent a lot of time just looking out the window			0
" @entity11 disappeared that same year after walking to a school bus in @entity3 , the first time he 'd walked to the bus alone			1
the boy 's plight catapulted concern for missing children to the national forefront after authorities splashed his image across thousands of milk cartons			1
it 's not clear whether @entity35 -- described by police as an off - the - books former stock boy turned 51 - year - old murder suspect -- was ever interviewed in the initial case			1
but more than three decades after @entity39 vanished , authorities say @entity35 confessed to the boy 's killing after being brought in for questioning last week			1
@entity35 has since been charged with second degree murder and is currently awaiting trial			1
but attorney @entity44 said his client -- who is currently on suicide watch at @entity47 in @entity3 -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation			1
according to police , the former stock clerk claims he lured @entity39 to the store 's basement with the promise of a soda before choking him to death			1
he then allegedly disposed of the body using a plastic bag , placing the boy inside a trash bin located a block and a half away from his work			2
" the detectives thought ( that confession ) was a feeling of relief on his part , " said police commissioner @entity65 , who described @entity35 as remorseful			1
prosecutors are now confronted with the task of corroborating that confession and piecing together a murder mystery that for decades has been littered with false positives			2
the image of @entity35 , meanwhile , has gradually come into focus as attention homes in on the reclusive suspect who , according to his attorney , apparently suffers from a " long psychiatric history " that includes schizophrenia , bipolar disorder and hallucinations			1
the @entity35 family -- a large clan consisting of 11 brothers and sisters -- moved from @entity89 to southern @entity90 in the early 1970s , a relative told @entity1			1
@entity35 attended high school in the @entity93 , area before moving to @entity3 at the age of 18 , sharing an apartment in the city 's @entity97 neighborhood with his older sister			1
sometime after his 19th birthday , @entity35 took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store			1
he worked in the @entity3 bodega for roughly a month before returning to his mother 's @entity6 home in the summer of 1979 , according to family members and police			1
@entity39 disappeared roughly a month earlier on may 25			2
describing @entity35 as having been a quiet young man , relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to @entity90			1
he grew further withdrawn while also frequently becoming ill , they said			0
though his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky , family members say at one point he returned to @entity0			0
it 's unclear for how long			0
police commissioner @entity65 told reporters last week that @entity35 was injured during a construction job sometime in the 1990s and has since been receiving disability compensation			2
but a relative claims that the suspect was instead injured during his employment at a clothing factory in @entity125 , @entity90			0
twice married , @entity35 fathered a daughter and settled down with a woman named @entity128 , his second wife , who relatives say had always had a crush on him			2
but financial troubles followed , and the couple filed for bankruptcy in 1999 , according to court documents			0
still , those who claim to know @entity35 offer mixed impressions of his character			2
@entity139 , a former @entity97 resident who says he knew @entity35 in @entity0 at the time of @entity39 's disappearance , described him as a " very strange guy			1
" " he was always by himself , " @entity139 recalled to @entity1 affiliate @entity143			0
" ( @entity144 ) never saw him with people			0
" his pastor , @entity146 , called him a " very quiet , unassuming , almost shy man , " who attended church regularly with his wife and daughter , often sitting in the same pew			0
" every sunday morning i had a conversation with him , " said @entity146 , who described the interaction as " more or less a greeting			0
" but the suspect 's sister , @entity157 , said their family had for years grappled with the knowledge of her brother 's alleged crime			0
she says she once walked into a @entity93 police station in the early 1980s to report the murder , telling authorities that her brother confessed to killing a boy in @entity0 and throwing the body near a dumpster			2
but , she says , there 's no indication that anything ever came out of that report			0
" you feel like they did n't believe you , " @entity157 told @entity1			0
" i was expecting something else			0
" " @entity179 asked whether i was mad " at her brother or had an ulterior motive , she said			0
@entity35 allegedly confided in a church prayer group that included members of his family and his then - spiritual adviser , his sister said , telling them of the alleged killing			2
@entity93 police and @entity188 , a leader of the prayer group , declined to comment			0
but @entity190 , whose 2009 book , " after @entity39 , " is widely considered the definitive account of the case , said she remains skeptical about the man 's confession , widely considered the signature element of his prosecution			0
" i had never heard of @entity35 before this week , " she told @entity1			2
a separate law enforcement source said @entity35 's claims were being treated with " a healthy dose of skepticism			1
" manhattan district attorney @entity202 ultimately gave the green light to file murder charges against @entity35 , despite the absence of forensic evidence , witness testimony and lingering questions over his mental state			1
@entity1 's @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this report .			0
