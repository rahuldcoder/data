-- champion cyclist @entity1 said wednesday the @entity2 intends to " dredge up discredited " doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven @entity7 victories			1
the @entity8 said it received a copy of a 15 - page agency letter sent tuesday to @entity1 and several others			1
as a result of the allegations , @entity1 was immediately banned from competing in triathlons , a sport he took up after retiring from professional bicycling , the newspaper reported on its website			1
@entity1 , as he has in the past , said he has never engaged in doping			1
" unlike many of my accusers , i have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance , passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one , " @entity1 said on his website			1
" that @entity2 ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about @entity2 , its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence			1
" @entity37 prosecutors in february said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against @entity1			1
they had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in @entity42 , but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that @entity1 used performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity1 was accused of using such drugs by other riders , but never failed a drug test			2
" these are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the @entity37 chose not to pursue after a two - year investigation , " @entity1 said wednesday			2
according to the @entity8 , the @entity2 alleged it collected blood samples from @entity1 in 2009 and 2010 that were " fully consistent with blood manipulation including @entity54 use and / or blood transfusions			1
" the allegations were previously unpublicized , according to the @entity8			0
opinion : why fans should n't forgive @entity1 the letter says @entity1 and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011 , the @entity8 reported			2
riders will testify that @entity1 used @entity54 , blood transfusions , testosterone and masking agents , and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005 , the @entity8 quoted the letter as saying			2
in a statement obtained by @entity0 , @entity2 ceo @entity69 said the five other people , formerly associated with the @entity73 pro cycling team , are three team doctors and two team officials			2
the letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations , @entity69 said " @entity2 only initiates matters supported by the evidence , " @entity69 said			1
" we do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures , intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence			0
" all named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise , he added			0
his statement did not mention anything about @entity1 's status as a triathlete			0
according to its website , the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity98 events in the @entity99			1
@entity1 lashed out at the organization , saying it has " self - written rules " and that it punishes first and adjudicates the facts later			0
@entity1 has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years , with compatriot @entity106 -- who was found guilty of doping in the @entity107 , resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year			0
@entity1 came out fighting once again in may 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the @entity114 " @entity113 " show by another @entity99 , @entity116			0
in the @entity114 interview , @entity116 -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw @entity1 use blood boosting substance @entity54 in 1999 , the year of his first @entity7 victory			0
" i saw it in his refrigerator , " @entity116 told the @entity99 news program			0
" i saw him inject it more than one time like we all did , like i did many , many times			0
" on his @entity128 page , @entity1 at the time said he never failed a drug test			0
ex-teammate : i saw @entity1 inject banned substances @entity0 's @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
