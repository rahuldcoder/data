-- does it matter that the new pope comes from @entity3 ? it matters greatly , because @entity3 shaped the life and the views of cardinal @entity7 , now @entity7			1
through @entity7 , @entity3 will help shape the church			1
more than any country in @entity10 , @entity3 is a nation of immigrants , with an unlikely mix of inhabitants -- including one of the world 's largest jewish communities			1
it is nation that has undergone enormous political upheaval , where the human rights abuses of a cruel military dictatorship remain an open wound			2
it is country of great natural wealth and a proud culture on impressive display , but one in which poverty and inequality remain urgent problems			1
the @entity33 elected the first pope from the @entity35 in its history and the first non-european in more than a thousand years			0
but the choice is important for more than symbolic reasons			0
the times in which we live test us and mold us			0
in @entity3 , @entity7 was tested and we can see some of the ways in which he was molded			1
by examining his career in @entity46 we can gain some insight into his coming papacy			0
as archbishop of @entity46 , @entity7 had an extraordinarily close relationship with the city 's jewish community			1
he worked together with them on anti-poverty programs and co-authored a book with a rabbi			0
as part of that relationship he was willing to address the @entity60 's controversial role during the @entity61 , supporting the need to open the @entity64 files to find out the truth			1
this suggests he might be open to lifting some of the secrecy that has shrouded the @entity64 in other controversies , perhaps even including the recent child sexual abuse scandals			0
opinion : @entity7 , open up the church he showed a commitment to interfaith relations , respect for other religions , and a determination to fight for justice			1
he attended @entity79 services , lit @entity81 candles , and pushed the @entity3 government to persevere with a stalled investigation of a 1994 attack against a @entity85 , the worst terrorist attack in @entity3 's history			1
he showed his commitment to finding the truth was not a matter of offering a sound - bite , but of pursuing justice ; again , a possible hint of things to come			0
his selection was widely celebrated in @entity3			1
like every other @entity3 , this pope will be a devout soccer fan			1
the soccer superstar @entity98 proclaimed , " the god of soccer is @entity3 , and now the pope is , too			1
it makes our country joyful			0
" but not everyone in @entity3 is celebrating			2
some human rights activists say @entity7 's behavior during the dictatorship that consumed @entity3 from 1976 - 1983 was shameful			1
during the years of military rule , the regime abducted and killed up to 30,000 people			0
during most of that time , @entity7 was head of the @entity112			2
the @entity60 generally supported the dictatorship			0
in the book " @entity115 , " by investigative reporter @entity116 , @entity7 is accused of deliberately failing to protect two @entity118 priests who were captured and imprisoned by the government			1
in a separate case from that era , @entity7 has been called to testify about the kidnapping of a baby , part of a regime practice of stealing the children of imprisoned activists and handing them for adoption by prominent families			2
@entity130 says she and her husband were kidnapped and their baby stolen			0
they claim @entity7 failed to intercede when he was asked , and accuse him of having knowledge of the practice and not speaking out			2
@entity137 : @entity7 pick a signal to @entity140 catholics @entity7 denies the accusations , and his supporters , including @entity3 @entity144 winner @entity143 say they are not true			1
more recently , @entity7 has not shied away from challenging the government			2
he vehemently rejected support for same - sex marriage , calling gay rights legislation " a machination of the @entity150			0
" and he forcefully criticized the government for what he viewed as a failure to tackle poverty and inequality			2
much has been written about his disdain for earthly comforts -- he prefers the bus to a chauffeur - driven limousine and cooked his own meals until now -- but his activism on behalf of the poor has been just as much a hallmark of his life			0
while he rejects " @entity165 , " a radical social and political ideology , he supports an aggressive policy to promote equality			0
and in what will be a papacy guided by conservative moral standards on most issues , his past suggests that the fight against poverty will take a primary role			2
he has declared that " human rights are not violated just by terrorism , repression and assassination , but also by unjust economic structures that produce great inequality			2
" living in @entity3 during the years of dictatorship and during times of economic upheaval that created more poverty put the new pope in a position to make moral choices			1
other popes before him faced the challenges of their time			0
opinion : pope @entity7 - a conservative who sides with the poor his immediate predecessor , pope @entity197 , came of age in @entity199 and , like other people of his generation , was a member of the @entity203 and served in the @entity205 military			1
he tried to explain those circumstances to critics during his papacy			0
before him , pope @entity209 grew up under communist rule in @entity211 , a fact that played a key role in his papacy when he helped inspire the fall of the @entity215 in @entity216			0
pope @entity7 grew up in a different place , with a different history			1
he lived in a country with a large @entity60 majority , but one where most people are not particularly devout			2
he will try to make @entity223 relevant , particularly to the poor , and he has shown he is not likely to promote a theology that seeks to demonize or distance itself from those who practice other religions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			0

@entity232 : @entity3 has unique makeup , circumstances that were crucible for new pope
she says @entity7 had close , good relationship with country 's large @entity85 community
she says he 's been accused of *abetting* dictator there in ' *70s* , ' *80s* ; he denies this
@entity245 : he 's conservative , has shown interest in inequality , sees poverty as rights issue
