as @entity2 's 14 - year - old sister rushed to her brother 's side upon learning he 'd been shot , police officers " tackled " her , handcuffed her and placed her in a squad car with the @entity8 officer who shot @entity2 , her mother and a @entity2 family attorney told reporters monday			1
the mother , @entity12 , was threatened with arrest herself as she " went charging and yelling at police " because they would n't let her run to her son 's aid , she said			1
speaking at a baptist church in @entity8 , @entity2 recalled how a seemingly normal november 22 morphed into tragedy as two @entity8 police officers pulled up to her son outside a recreation center across the street from her home			1
within two seconds of exiting the police car , officer @entity25 gunned down @entity2 , 12			1
the boy died the next day			0
@entity2 was playing with a pellet gun , and a witness who saw " a guy with a pistol " told 911 twice that it was " probably " fake but that @entity2 was scaring people			2
it does n't appear the 911 dispatcher relayed the information to @entity37 , 26 , and @entity38 , 46			0
police have said that @entity25 , who has been criticized for his policing in the past , opened fire after @entity2 reached for the gun in his waistband and that an orange tip indicating the gun was a toy had been removed			1
@entity2 said she did n't allow her son to play with toy guns , explaining that one of his friends had given it to him			1
the boy 's mother recalled monday how she got the news that the youngest of her four children had been shot			1
" two little boys came and knocked on my door and said , ' police officers just shot your son twice in the stomach , ' " she said			1
at first , she did n't believe them but quickly realized they were telling the truth			0
" i really thought they was playing , like joking around , but i saw the seriousness in their face , and it scared me , " she said			0
she ran to the scene , admittedly frantic , and arrived at the same time as an ambulance			2
officers would n't let her check on her son , she said , " and then i saw my daughter in the back of a police car , the same one the shooter got out of			2
" family attorney @entity78 said police placed @entity2 's sister in the car with @entity25			1
@entity12 said she calmed down and asked police to release her daughter			2
they told her no , she said			0
not only would they not release her daughter , but later , she said , they made her choose : stay with her daughter or accompany her son to a hospital			0
she chose the latter but was told she could n't ride in the back of the ambulance with her son , so she rode in the front seat on the way to the hospital , she said			0
" the treatment of the family is unacceptable , " said councilman @entity94 , who appeared alongside the family at the news conference			0
" it just shows the lack of training when we shackle a grieving sister , threaten a grieving mother and not even take care of a child lying on the ground			0
" @entity8 police declined to discuss the family 's allegations			1
detective @entity111 told @entity0 , " we 're really not commenting further at this point			0
" in a lawsuit filed last week against the city and the two officers , the family says @entity25 and @entity38 " refused to provide any medical attention to @entity2 for at least four minutes as he lay on the ground alive and bleeding			2
" @entity8 police chief @entity120 has previously said that four minutes after @entity2 was shot , a detective and @entity124 agent arrived and the @entity124 agent administered first aid			1
paramedics arrived three minutes later , the chief said			0
attorney @entity128 said the @entity2 family is " very distrustful " of the justice system , and in light of the grand jury rulings in the @entity132 and @entity133 cases , is demanding a transparent investigation			1
in contrast to the @entity132 and @entity133 cases , the family also wants the officers -- who are on paid leave -- charged before a grand jury hears the case , said @entity128 , who also represents the @entity132 family			1
" there is nothing written anywhere in the law that says police officers are to be treated differently from any other citizen , " @entity128 said			0
" we can not have children playing cops and robbers on a playground and police officers coming and claiming their lives			0
" @entity2 was by himself in a gazebo when @entity38 and @entity25 pulled onto the grass alongside the gazebo and got out of their car			2
from the dispatcher 's failure to relay the report that the gun was probably fake to the haste with which @entity25 shot the sixth - grader , @entity128 said " several things were done inappropriately , " which is sufficient probable cause to charge the policemen			1
the family attorneys also called for the ouster of safety director @entity174 and @entity175 , executive assistant to the mayor -- a call echoing one by @entity180 , who asked for their resignations in a @entity8 newspaper last week after a @entity184 report that said @entity8 police had a pattern of excessive force			1
the family 's primary objective , @entity128 said , is to " hold the killer of their child accountable			0
" " @entity2 was a bright child			2
he had a promising future , " his mother said , explaining that he was a talented artist , drummer and athlete			0
asked what would represent justice in her eyes , @entity12 replied , " i 'm actually looking for a conviction			0

@entity2 ' s mother said police threatened her when she arrived at scene of son 's shooting
@entity2 , 12 , was shot when , police say , he reached for a toy gun in his waistband in november
mother tells reporters how two little boys delivered the news that police had shot @entity2
attorneys urge @entity8 to charge police , not follow @entity132 , @entity133 grand jury models
