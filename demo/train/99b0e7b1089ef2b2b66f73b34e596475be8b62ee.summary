-- these days , it 's seems like we are all expected to do more with less			1
spending hours in the office to make sure all the assigned tasks get done bleeds into our family time , and even at home , it seems there 's a never - ending cycle of things that must be done			1
yet studies have shown that 60 - hour workweeks can result in a 25 % decrease in productivity			1
the productivity numbers get worse as the work hours increase , because exhaustion steadily erodes judgment and performance			1
so what to do when there 's too much to do ? the key is to do less , not more ( what , you 've never heard a time management expert tell you the key to success is to do less ? )			2
see also : do n't let e-mail run your work life just say no first , say " no " to more work			2
though this might sound obvious , it 's one of the hardest things to actually do			0
but being realistic about the amount of additional work you can take on is as important as getting the job done			2
a simple , " sorry -- i 'd love to help out , but i do n't have the bandwidth to take that on right now , " is sufficient			0
negotiate when that fails , negotiate			0
if your boss presents you with a project you ca n't outright refuse , but your plate is undeniably full , do n't hesitate to point this out			0
openly discuss your current deadlines and workload , and communicate both honestly and clearly			0
for example , you might say , " i 'm currently working on @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 i want to return quality work in a timely way , and if i take on this new project , it will jeopardize my promised deadlines			2
would you like me to hand it off to someone else , outsource it , or would you prefer to reprioritize my existing commitments ? " see also : is workplace boredom ' the new stress ? ' prioritize focus on strategic enablers of business			2
everyone has too much to do , and nobody really cares how many tasks you crossed off a to - do list if key projects keep falling through the cracks			1
split your to - do lists into a master list and a @entity79 ( hit ) list			1
while the master lists tracks everything that needs to get done at some point , the hit list includes only a reasonable number of items that can be accomplished each day , so you 're constantly focused on key priorities and work on them in the proper order : @entity91 : you will get fired if this is n't done today			1
@entity93 : a valuable long - term activity that should be done soon			2
@entity95 : someone will be unhappy if this is n't done eventually			0
@entity98 : human " pain - management " activities such as socializing or @entity101			0
focus master the skills of concentration			1
stop multitasking and focus on one thing at a time			1
multitasking just dilutes your attention and fools you into thinking you 're productive , when you 're really just busy			0
do n't allow people to hold distracting conversations outside your cubicle or office door either			0
limit your social media usage , and anything else that can keep you from accomplishing your most important tasks			0
when you find ways to do less while increasing your impact , you 'll gain more time to spend on things you actually enjoy			0
