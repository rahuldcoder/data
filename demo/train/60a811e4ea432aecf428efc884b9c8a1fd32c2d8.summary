@entity0 -- four hundred @entity3 geese from @entity5 's @entity4 were herded into crates and euthanized last week in an effort to reduce their number near @entity0 's airports , according to @entity12 @entity11			1
measures to lower the number of @entity3 geese close to @entity16 and @entity17 international airports have been in place since last summer , said @entity20 , spokeswoman for the @entity11 's @entity21			1
@entity0 officials asked for federal assistance with solving the goose problem after @entity25 was cripped by a bird strike and narrowly avoided crashing by successfully landing in the @entity27 in january 2009			1
" our responsibility is to look at safety hazards and the @entity3 geese can represent a significant aviation hazard , " @entity20 said			1
the round - up last week came to light in @entity0 media on tuesday			0
the group @entity35 ( @entity35 ) issued a statement criticizing the euthanization and calling on authorities to use other methods to keep birds away from airports			1
" killing every goose within a seven - mile radius of an airport does n't fly -- it is n't humane , and it is n't a viable solution for either people or birds , " @entity35 said in the statement			1
" when geese are killed , more birds simply move in to use available resources , and the temporary spike in the food supply results in accelerated breeding			1
what follows is a vicious killing cycle that is cruel , expensive , and pointless			0
" the group cited other methods including a radar system at the @entity60 to detect flocks of birds , as well as lasers and pyrotechnics , as being better ways to change birds ' flight paths			0
the @entity5 geese , which are molting at this time of year and can not fly , were herded into a fenced area , put in poultry crates and taken to a facility where they were euthanized with carbon dioxide , said @entity20			1
the geese were later bagged and buried in a landfill , she said			2
last month the radius from @entity78 and @entity17 airports where @entity3 geese would be removed and euthanized was increased from five to seven miles and @entity20 said the new radius included @entity5 's @entity4			1
" @entity78 and @entity17 are between six and seven miles from @entity4 border - to - border , " she said adding that she understood that attachment that people in the area have to the geese			2
" we made the process as least stressful as possible for the geese , " she said			2
@entity89 , who said he is 60 years old and has been going to @entity4 most of his life , called the removal of the geese " unnecessary			2
" he said that he and his companion go to the park most mornings at around 7 a.m , and had started feeding a goose they called " @entity99 " early last year			0
the goose had lost it 's upper beak to a fishing hook			0
" on wednesday all the geese were there , we fed @entity105 and on thursday they were gone			2
@entity105 was gone , too , " he said			0
@entity89 who said he found zip ties and rope in the park said that the authorities had accomplished nothing by killing the geese			2
" they have done a lot of harm and we do n't believe they have done anything to help the public , they 've done more harm than good , " he said			0
@entity120 , who said he was a fireman who has lived in the area all his life and goes to the park regularly with his 10 year old son said that although he thought the geese were beautiful and understood that it had upset the neighborhood , he agreed with the decision to remove them			0
" what 's more important , 200 geese or 200 people ? that 's the choice that has to be made , " he said adding that he flies frequently			0
@entity20 said @entity3 geese were responsible for over 600 damaging airstrikes to @entity12 planes between 1990 and 2008 , and that their population was rapidly increasing			0
" the @entity3 goose population increased from 19,000 in 1981 to 250,000 in 2008 , making it a 12-fold increases in almost 30 years , " she said			0
@entity20 said that 1,200 @entity3 geese were euthanized in 2009 in 17 @entity0 locations .			1

the geese were euthanized by carbon dioxide
the @entity11 say geese can represent a significant aviation hazard
@entity35 says euthanization " is n't a viable solution " for the problem
