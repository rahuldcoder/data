-- @entity1 won an @entity2 for covering up her beauty and finding grains of sympathy , as well as revulsion , for the serial killer @entity7 in " @entity8			1
" she deserves to win a second nomination for playing the sexy , unmoored , utterly reprehensible @entity10 in " @entity11			1
" @entity10 is one of those people blessed with good looks , talent and brains , but whose sense of entitlement far outstrips any civilized social boundaries			1
she 's a pure narcissist , oblivious to other people 's feelings and contemptuous of any experience that does n't feed her own ego			1
in other words , @entity10 is another monster , but a monster who can pass for beautiful with only a couple of hours in the salon			1
as we know ( you see it spread all over the supermarket tabloids every week ) , there 's a perverse thrill in watching one of the beautiful people fall apart			1
and there 's some of that same schadenfreude in play while watching the new black comedy from the " @entity45 " combo , writer @entity43 and director @entity44			2
@entity10 is a ghostwriter for a successful young adult book series , and even that minor claim to fame is soon to be extinguished : the series is played out and the novel she is working on will be the last of them			1
perhaps that 's why she feels compelled to head back home when she receives an e-mail from an ex-boyfriend , @entity55 ( @entity56 ) , announcing the birth of his first child			1
figuring , very , very , wrongly , that this message must be some kind of coded cry for help , @entity10 hops into her @entity63 and heads straight to @entity11 , @entity64 , where she grew up , and where she means to reconnect with @entity55 and free him from his domesticated servitude			1
as plans go , this one has " recipe for disaster " written all over it			2
but @entity10 sees things differently : it 's all for love , a romantic quest , the oldest story in the book			1
first , though , she bumps into @entity76 ( @entity77 ) , a broken - down part - time waiter with a bum leg , who claims to have had the locker next to hers all through high school			2
the cane is a giveaway - " you 're the @entity89 ! " -- the hetero victim of a gay - bashing in senior year that left him crippled and understandably bitter			2
@entity44 punctuates the movie with shots of @entity10 putting on her camouflage : nail treatments , wardrobe choices			1
she has style and beauty at her fingertips			2
but the first time we see her we get a keener sense of this woman on a precipice : sprawled face down in bed , half undressed , hungover			2
it 's the difference between @entity10 as she wants to be seen and as she really is , if she could only admit it			1
@entity76 is the only one she allows into her trust , either because she badly needs a drinking buddy and he has a distillery in his garage , or because she 's so far above him in any social criteria that she understands he poses no discernible threat			0
but she 's wrong about this , too ( just as she 's wrong about everything )			0
hovering somewhere between @entity115 and partner - in - crime , @entity76 is the movie 's comic safety valve			0
@entity77 steers a path for us , transfixed , attracted and appalled by this woman 's reckless , tunnel - vision trajectory			0
@entity124 is also the beneficiary of @entity126 's most sardonic one - liners , and could wind up with an @entity2 nomination of his own			0
once or twice @entity10 is permitted a shred of insight			1
reluctantly reunited with her parents , she softly confesses that she thinks she might be an alcoholic			0
they foolishly laugh off the revelation , which if nothing else suggests where she may have come by her capacity for denial			0
then toward the end , when denial just wo n't wash any longer , she talks about the necessity for change			0
but again , she chooses the wrong confessor , and promptly reverts to type			0
it 's a brave movie that crushes our hopes of redemption so conclusively , and a promising indication that @entity44 and @entity126 are growing up			0
it 's not hard to spot familiar feminist , or postfeminist themes from @entity126 's " @entity45 " and " @entity151 " here , reworked with greater complexity and depth			0
partly that 's a tribute to @entity156 's performance , of course , which never once succumbs to the " psychotic prom queen b * * * * " caricature that one character thinks she sees			0
even when she 's at her worst ( almost all the time ) , there 's always an undertow of panic and disturbance in @entity167 , the barely suppressed horror that time is running out and she 's thrown her eggs in the wrong basket			0
we may find it impossible to like her , but it 's easy to feel sorry for her .			0
