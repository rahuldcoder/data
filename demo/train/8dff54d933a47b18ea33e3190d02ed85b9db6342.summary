-- all 's well that ends well , as they say : after a multi-platform promotional blitz , @entity4 's @entity3 is the number one album in the country this week			1
@entity9 reports that @entity4 's new album sold about 258,000 copies in its first week of release , giving her the second chart - topping debut of her career			1
as previously discussed , it 's a long way from the numbers she did with @entity18 back in 2011,though it still gives her the third biggest debut for a woman in 2013 behind @entity24 's @entity23 and @entity26 ' @entity25			2
@entity0 : @entity4 will close @entity28 's legendary @entity27 @entity3 narrowly bested @entity30 's @entity29 , which sold 210,000 copies in its second week of release			1
three other albums made their debuts in the top 10 this week : now 48 ( no. 3 with 114,000 ) , the @entity35 : live at the @entity36 2 ( no. 7 , with 37,000 ) , and @entity39 © @entity38 's @entity37 ( no. 8 with 34,000 )			0
the next big chart question is , " when will @entity42 's ' @entity41 ' be dethroned ? " though we wo n't know what song is on the top of the @entity48 until later today , it looks an awful lot like @entity30 's " @entity50 " could make a run at the top			2
@entity0 : why is n't @entity4 's ' @entity3 ' getting a sales boost from her ' snl ' appearance ? the track is the top - selling digital song of the week ( it moved 243,000 copies ) , and the track has been embraced by both hip - hop and pop radio thanks to @entity62 's hook			1
" @entity50 " was the number two song in the country last week , and looks primed to make the move to knock " @entity41 " off its seven - week perch			0
