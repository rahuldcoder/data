-- twenty - five year - old student @entity1 was frustrated			1
he wanted to take " fisheye " - style camera pictures without having to pay for an expensive lens , or fiddle around with a smartphone app. he wanted something light and small that he could pull from his pocket at a moment 's notice			1
unfortunately such a device did not exist			2
so , he went ahead and invented it			1
measuring just four centimeters long and two centimeters high , the " @entity17 " has only two buttons and no viewing screen			1
however , an array of nifty features -- including a timelapse mode , 12 megapixel resolution and hd video recording capabilities -- have proven so popular with photography enthusiasts that the camera easily surpassed its funding target on the crowdsourcing website , @entity27			2
the @entity17 had raised $ 100,000 as donations came to a close this morning , almost double the initial $ 53,000 target			1
" it 's all been a bit overwhelming , " said @entity1			0
" at one point i was getting an email every seven minutes and it has been just impossible to respond to everyone			0
" because the money has gone so far over the goal now though i can get other people on board to help get the cameras out , " he added			0

he resolved to fashion one himself using an old camera and a lens he had custom made			2
when friends were impressed with the results he decided to see if he could raise the funds to put his invention into production			0
a manufacturer -- which he does n't wish to reveal as he is still in the pre-production phase -- was then sourced to make a limited run of 1,000 devices completely from scratch which will be sold on a first - come first - served basis			1
the cameras are priced at $ 100 each and orders have already arrived from as far afield as @entity66 and @entity67			0
" it 's been amazing as there has been interest from everywhere really , all over the world , " @entity1 said			0
" i was even invited to go on @entity72 ( a popular @entity73 tv show where entrepreneurs pitch their products and ideas to prominent businesspeople ) but there 's no way i 'm going on that , " he added			2

his main priority remains studying towards a phd on the economic and social impact of wind energy development at the @entity95 in his native wales			0
the success of @entity17 however has helped him pay - off mounting student fees and encouraged him to further test his powers of invention			1
he now has a new limited edition camera in the pipeline which he hopes to release at the end of the summer , although he remains tight - lipped as to what exactly that may be			1
" there 's going to be a view finder added and a load of other features but i do n't want to give away what it is yet , " he said			0
" it 's going to be able to do something that you ca n't do on any smartphone and would usually cost hundreds of pounds but i can do it for about Â £ 50 ( $ 76 )			0

for now , however , the main priority is to continue with his studies while indulging his passion for photography and camera development when he can			2
" it 's not a business really , just a project that i 'm working on to see what we can do with cameras and have a bit of fun with them , " he said			0
" i really enjoy my phd and the work that i do so if the money i make from the cameras makes that a bit easier or more comfortable for me then all the better			0
