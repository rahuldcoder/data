@entity0 -- a post-mortem sunday of the mid-term elections provided little evidence that @entity5 and @entity6 will work together to address major issues such as deficit reduction any better than they have in recent years			1
republicans interviewed on talk shows promised congressional investigations , an all - out effort to repeal health care reform , and steadfast opposition to any form of higher taxes			1
democrats , meanwhile , said the losses they suffered in the congressional elections reflected voter dissatisfaction with lingering high unemployment in the slow recovery from economic recession , rather than an outright repudiation of their policies			0
republicans won more than 60 seats formerly held by @entity5 to take majority control of the @entity29 , and also narrowed the @entity5 majority in the @entity31 , while winning the lion 's share of governors ' races around the country			0
when asked what they would do with their greater power , @entity6 legislators offered a hard - line agenda that left little room for middle - ground compromise			1
@entity43 gov. @entity42 , considered a likely presidential contender in 2012 , told @entity1 's " @entity45 " that he advocated repealing the health care bill and ensuring that government operates on the revenues available			1
voters want to see results on creating jobs , and if republicans do n't produce , " we 'll be thrown out in two years , " @entity42 said			0
@entity53 rep. @entity53 of @entity54 , who is expected to become the new @entity29 majority leader in january , questioned on " @entity56 " whether there was any benefit to compromising with president @entity59			1
the question was not whether @entity59 was willing to work with @entity6 , as he stated last week , but , " are we willing to work with him ? " @entity53 asked			1
" i mean , first and foremost , we 're not going to be willing to work with him on the expansive liberal agenda he 's been about , " @entity53 said			1
senate minority leader @entity65 , @entity66 , told the @entity68 program " @entity70 " that agreement exists on some specific provisions , but he refused to signal any willingness to compromise			0
" we anticipate we 'll be able to do the people 's business in areas on which we agree , " @entity73 said			0
in @entity77 , @entity78 , on sunday , @entity59 told a student at a town hall - style meeting that the election results showed he needed to make adjustments after two years in office			1
after explaining he must stick to core policies such as education and infrastructure investment and clean energy development , @entity59 said he also needs to " make some mid-course corrections and adjustments			1
" " how those play themselves out over the next several months will be a matter of me being in discussions with the @entity6 , " the president said , adding : " there are going to be areas where we disagree and hopefully there are going to be some areas where we agree			1
" however , beyond four items listed by @entity73 -- nuclear energy and electric - car development , clean coal technology , and expanded free - trade agreements -- republicans offered no other areas of agreement			0
the first issue likely to come up when @entity110 reconvenes next week in a lame - duck session will be whether to extend @entity113 - era tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of the year			0
@entity59 wants to extend the lower tax rates for income below $ 200,000 a year for individuals and $ 250,000 a year for families , saying that means 98 percent of @entity120 wo n't be subject to a de facto tax increase			1
@entity6 oppose higher tax rates for anyone , including the nation 's wealthiest 2 percent , arguing it would harm small business owners who traditionally bring about significant job creation			2
in an interview to be broadcast sunday night on the @entity68 program " @entity130 , " @entity59 expressed a willingness to compromise , perhaps by extending the lower tax rates for wealthy @entity120 for a two - year period as long as everyone else also maintains their current lower rates			2
@entity73 , however , made clear that @entity6 believe no one should have their tax rates return to the higher levels of the 1990s			2
" we do n't have a revenue problem ; we have a spending problem , " @entity73 said , repeating a line parroted by @entity6 on other shows			1
" so the whole nomenclature surrounding this -- that somehow we 're doing people a favor by giving them their own money back -- i just do n't accept			0
the government is too big			2
it needs to be shrunk			0
" other @entity6 positions spelled out sunday included reducing non-military " discretionary " spending -- such as department and agency budgets , but not including entitlement programs like @entity154 and @entity155 -- to 2008 levels , reducing federal wages and cutting the federal workforce			1
a unanimous @entity6 policy is to try to get the health care reform bill repealed			1
while acknowledging @entity59 and the @entity5 will almost certainly be able to stave off full repeal , @entity6 lawmakers including @entity73 , @entity53 and others advocated cutting funding and mounting legal challenges to hinder implementation of the measure until they can try to defeat @entity59 in 2012			1
some of the @entity6 opponents of the bill also called for keeping popular provisions touted by @entity59 and @entity5 , such as preventing insurance companies from dropping coverage when people get sick , or denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions			1
" we 're going to do everything we can to try and repeal and replace this thing , " @entity6 rep. @entity6 of @entity176 , expected to be the new chairman of the @entity178 , said on " @entity56			2
" @entity5 rep. @entity182 of @entity183 told @entity68 that the @entity6 were on the wrong side of history on the health care issue			1
@entity182 noted that similar calls for repeal followed landmark legislation in the past including the @entity190 that allowed @entity191 - @entity120 to vote			0
" the fact of the matter is what we did with health care is to make that a fundamental right of every citizen , " @entity182 said			1
amid the legislative wrangling will be new investigations by the @entity200 , @entity201 rep. @entity201 of @entity202 , the expected new chairman of the panel in january , told the @entity56 program			0
he cited @entity29 attempts to influence candidates to drop out of primary elections , as occurred in the @entity31 race , as one issue to be investigated			0
@entity201 's committee also will support a @entity213 probe of alleged voter intimidation by two members of the @entity216 at a @entity218 , @entity219 , voting station in 2008 , he said			0
@entity201 later told reporters that he currently had no plans to issue subpoenas to members of the @entity59 administration			2
" there 's a history of corruption in @entity120 politics at the presidential level that goes back to @entity230 , " @entity201 said			0
" i think what we have to do is look for the places where we can make changes , and make those changes , and try to get the administration to do what they need to do to comply			2
" meanwhile , signs of friction within the @entity6 also appeared sunday , with conservative lawmakers pushing plans not favored by some in the @entity6 congressional leadership			2
@entity6 sen. @entity243 of @entity183 , who supported @entity245 candidates across the country in toppling mainstream contenders in @entity6 primaries , called for a halt to all congressional earmarks as part of a conservative action plan against high spending			1
@entity73 , however , said the issue was more complex than just spending , involving whether the legislature has the authority to determine exactly how money gets spent			2
@entity243 made clear that he and the new @entity245 conservatives rejected @entity73 's position			0
" i know there 's some senior members in @entity110 who think it 's their job to bring home the bacon , " @entity243 said on the @entity261 program " @entity262			0
" he called such thinking " parochial politics " against the national interest and said : " we ca n't do that anymore			0
" one of those @entity245 - backed winners tuesday , senator - elect @entity273 of @entity274 , offered a potential major concession on the @entity277 program " @entity278 " when he said military spending should be part of the cuts needed to balance the federal budget			2
republicans traditionally push for increased military spending and have generally made clear they favor cutting only non-military discretionary spending , and @entity73 said @entity273 would have to persuade his new colleagues to support him			0
" well , you know , he 's going to have an opportunity in the @entity31 to offer all of those ideas , " @entity73 said			0
" we 'll get votes on them			0

@entity6 targets health care reform , government spending
" are we willing to work with him ? " @entity53 says of president @entity59
@entity59 says he needs to make " mid-course " corrections and adjustments
