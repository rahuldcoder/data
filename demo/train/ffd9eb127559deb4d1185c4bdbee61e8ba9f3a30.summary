@entity2 @entity1 sen. @entity0 , who is toying with the idea of a presidential bid , joked in a private gathering this month that " white men who are in male - only clubs are going to do great in my presidency , " according to an audio recording of his comments provided to @entity3			1
in the meeting , the @entity13 also cracked wise about @entity15 , saying " they 're the ones who drink and do n't admit it , " a variation of a joke he sometimes tells in public			0
@entity0 's folksy sense of humor and his shoot - from - the - hip style are part of his political appeal , and well - known to journalists and his colleagues in the @entity30			1
but the behind - closed - doors remarks are a departure from the @entity34 - rated jokes he tells in public , and another reminder for politicians in the @entity39 era that they are rarely far from a microphone , no matter how private the setting			1
the audio snippets were provided to @entity3 on wednesday by two separate @entity1 @entity45 who received the recordings from a person using an anonymous @entity50 address			0
@entity0 confirmed the recordings in an interview wednesday with @entity3			1
the person did n't provide details on his background but told the @entity45 that @entity0 was speaking to an " all - male club " in @entity57 earlier this month , the @entity45 said			1
both of the @entity45 wished to remain anonymous			0
after @entity3 contacted his campaign , @entity0 said in the interview that he made the comments several weeks ago at a meeting of the @entity63 of @entity57 , the @entity64 charity organization that sometimes hosts big - name politicians for irreverent and frequently bawdy speeches			1
@entity0 said the @entity63 encourages speakers " to be earthy , to make fun of yourself , to make fun of them			2
then you say something serious and sit down			0
and if you talk over 20 minutes , they throw something at you			0
" in the recordings , @entity0 , who is favored in his race for re-election next tuesday against @entity77 @entity76 , appears to joke about the possible 2016 presidential bid he recently floated in an interview with the @entity81			2
" i 'm trying to help you with your tax status , " @entity0 says in the recording			1
" i 'm sorry the government 's so f --- ed up			0
if i get to be president , white men in male - only clubs are going to do great in my presidency			1
" the crowd is then heard laughing			0
in another clip , @entity0 asks , " we got any @entity93 here ? we got any @entity15 ? they 're the ones that drink and do n't admit it			2
" again , the crowd chuckles			0
contacted about the recording , @entity0 's campaign arranged for the senator to speak about the remarks by phone from @entity1			1
the @entity63 hosts an annual @entity105 banquet that , in the past , has been headlined by top political figures like vice president @entity107 and former vice president @entity108			0
" i have never been to the @entity109 , but it 's a little like that , " @entity0 said			2
his october visit to the society was a separate event , he said , but the spirit was the same			2
" i hope this does n't reflect poorly on the club , " he said			0
" they are great guys			0
" @entity0 said he was making fun of the society 's all - male membership , joking that they were the last such organization in existence after @entity123 admitted women			1
as for the @entity126 riff , @entity0 said he regularly teases @entity1 audiences about their various religious denominations , before making a larger point about religious liberty in the @entity131 and warning about the threat of radical @entity133 overseas .			2
