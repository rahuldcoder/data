-- in a scene unfolding in many @entity6 communities throughout the country , the graduation ceremony at @entity2 in @entity3 was especially celebratory saturday : 20 % of the graduating seniors are illegal immigrants who can now put their education to use with work permits authorized by president @entity13 's new immigration rules			1
" what the president did this week was an amazing gift to me and other students who are undocumented , " graduating senior @entity19 , 18 , told @entity0			1
" it 's just an emotional thing to have the same opportunities that other students have and that we did n't have just because we did n't have papers , " added @entity19 , who was born in @entity20 and came to the @entity21 at age 5 with her family			1
for the class of 2012 , the routine tossing of mortarboards in the air was more emotional than anticipated , said classmate @entity34 , 18 , who 's also an undocumented immigrant from @entity20			1
his family brought him to the @entity21 when he was 3 months old			0
" it 's so unexpected , " @entity36 said of @entity13 's executive order , announced friday			1
" it 's like a dream			2
i can finally do something with my life now			2
" @entity36 is going to study bio-engineering on a scholarship at the @entity46			0
he wants to find a cure for cancer , he said			0
" i 'm determined to do it now that i have a chance to do it , " said @entity36 , who will be the first one in his family to go to college			0
as an honors graduate , a yellow sash topped his blue cap and gown			0
" this is going to change my life			2
it was a life - changing experience for all of us and for my family , " he added about the new immigration rules announced friday			1
@entity64 , the leader of @entity3 's largest @entity6 advocacy organization that runs @entity66 and 10 other city charter schools , said the @entity69 announcement was " a high note for the graduating ceremony			1
" " it 's a timely announcement , and it 's coming at the end of the school year , " @entity64 said			2
in a measure that a @entity78 analysis said could benefit up to 1.4 million children and young adults , the @entity13 administration said it will offer work permits to illegal immigrants younger than age 30 who came to the @entity21 before age 16 and meet certain criteria			1
participants must be in the @entity21 now and be able to prove they have been living in the country continuously for at least five years			0
the centerpiece of the @entity13 measure grants illegal immigrants a two - year deferral from deportation if they pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military , administration officials said			1
the change is part of a @entity101 effort to target resources at illegal immigrants who pose a greater threat , such as criminals and those trying to enter the country now , officials said			1
for many educators and school leaders across the nation , the new program means undocumented immigrant students can come out of the shadows and underground economy of society and participate legally in the @entity21 work force , @entity64 said			1
equally important , teachers and principals now have an answer to illegal immigrant students who have asked " what 's the point ? " about pursuing a higher education , @entity64 said			1
" at some point these kids ask themselves the question : they work hard , they get the good grades , but what 's the point of going to a university if they ca n't work ? " said @entity64 , chief executive officer of the @entity123 , which operates 11 charter schools in @entity3 serving 5,500 students			1
he 's also president of the @entity123			2
" it 's almost like a leap of faith that we have asked of these kids : something is bound to happen , and you ca n't give up at this point			0
that leap of faith has been answered , and it opens a whole new horizon for these kids , " he said			0
@entity19 was on the brink of greeting such an opening			0
" the emotions that go through me to think that one day when i graduate from college that i might become a doctor or teacher and that i 'll be able to do it without having to go anywhere else -- i thought i would have to go back where i came from , " @entity19 told @entity0			0
her parents were equally elated about the graduates ' new possibilities			0
" i 'm so overwhelmed , " her mother , @entity155 , told @entity0			0
" i 'm very thankful for everything			0
we have faith that their dreams are going to be realized			0
" " it 's great that the students are going to have this opportunity " to work , said @entity161			2
@entity19 said she 's going to save money for a four - year college by first attending the two - year @entity167 , one of the @entity169			0
she plans on majoring in biology and wants to become a science or biology teacher			0
twenty - one of @entity2 's 107 graduates are undocumented immigrants -- a figure that 's not too surprising because the school is located in a @entity180 immigrant community in the @entity182 neighborhood on @entity3 's southwest side , @entity64 said			1
the school is 99 % latino , with a 93 % poverty rate , but 97 % of the graduates are going to college on academic scholarships totaling $ 4.7 million , @entity64 said			2
@entity13 's executive order addresses a major concern of the nation 's burgeoning @entity6 community -- now the nation 's no. 2 group under the 2010 census -- and mimics some of the provisions of a @entity198 proposal called the @entity199 , which has failed to win enough @entity201 support to gain congressional approval			1
both @entity13 and homeland security secretary @entity203 cautioned friday that the order is not a pathway to citizenship and urged @entity207 to pass the @entity199			2
the @entity208 -- or @entity209 -- act would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the @entity21 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the @entity21 for at least five years ; obtained a high school or general education development diploma ; demonstrated " good moral character " ; and have n't committed crimes that " would make them inadmissible to the country , " according to a @entity69 fact sheet .			1
