@entity14 ( left ) and @entity15 , parents of @entity17			2
@entity18 , who was 17 when she started work in @entity6 , was convicted of killing a 4 - month - old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job			1
@entity4 says the child died accidentally , choking on milk			1
his daughter was sentenced to beheading in a case rights groups say underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million @entity1 who work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in @entity6 alone			1
" our family was suffering hardship , and so our daughter volunteered to go and work abroad to send money home , " @entity4 told @entity2 by telephone from his modest home in @entity32 in @entity1 's war - torn northeast			1
after the december 2004 tsunami forced them from their home , the family was displaced again by renewed civil war between the state and separatist @entity48 rebels			1
@entity4 visited @entity6 with @entity1 's deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency and met with relations of the dead child 's parents but came away empty handed			1
under @entity6 law , a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim , and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or @entity1 officials			1
" the cops told us : ' go and pray to @entity68			0
if you can get the forgiveness of the parents , your daughter will be free , ' " he said			0
" so i am praying all the time			0
" " if we had been able to meet the parents , we are sure they would have been willing to forgive our daughter after seeing our situation			0
" the @entity1 government is investigating the agency that sent @entity18 to work abroad when she was technically still a child but remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated			1
" i am fairly confident , " said deputy foreign minister @entity80			0
" we have spoken to tribal leaders of their particular tribe , we have spoken to area officials ... it is they who will now have to speak ( to the parents )			0
" " his excellency the president ( @entity90 ) has been following this case very keenly			0
this is an exceptional case because of her tender age , " he added			0
rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers -- one of the main sources of foreign - exchange revenues for the $ 23 billion economy -- with legal aid			0
they also decry @entity6 's legal system			1
" this case raises many troubling questions about the treatment of children and foreigners in @entity6 's criminal - justice system , " @entity104 said in a statement issued overnight			2
" international law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18			0
" @entity6 executed four @entity1 convicted of armed robbery earlier this year , and did not inform @entity1 authorities beforehand			1
@entity1 reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge , but it has been dormant since 1976			2
there is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers , rapists and drug smugglers on death row in @entity1 and effectively serving life prison terms will actually be executed			2
