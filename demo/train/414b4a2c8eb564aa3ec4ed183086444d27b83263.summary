@entity0 will not return an unmanned @entity2 stealth plane that it says it has , one of @entity0 's top generals said , according to the semi-official @entity6 news agency on sunday			1
" no nation welcomes other countries ' spy drones in its territory , and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin , " said gen. @entity7 , deputy commander of the @entity8			1
" it makes no difference where this drone originated and which group or country sent it to invade our air space , " @entity7 said			0
" this was an act of invasion and belligerence			0
" @entity2 officials have not confirmed that the drone in a video released thursday is a @entity2 aircraft , but @entity33 spokesman @entity32 has said that an @entity2 drone is missing and had not been recovered as of thursday			1
but two @entity2 officials confirmed to @entity36 on tuesday that the missing drone was part of a @entity40 reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in @entity43			1
@entity0 's official @entity44 said the country 's armed forces had downed the drone near @entity48 , some 225 kilometers ( 140 miles ) from the border with @entity43 on december 4			1
@entity7 said downing the plane was " very valuable for us " and " a victory for us and a defeat for our enemies , " @entity44 reported			0
he also claimed @entity0 had downed other drones earlier but had not announced those instances because they were not as important			1
@entity0 tv aired images thursday of what it says is the drone , an apparently intact @entity62 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed			2
there was disagreement among @entity33 officials about whether the drone in the video was real			1
military and intelligence officials were analyzing the @entity0 television footage			2
one @entity2 official said the @entity2 ca n't be certain it 's the real stealth drone , because @entity2 personnel do n't have access to it			2
but he added there 's no reason to think it 's a fake			0
however , a second senior @entity2 military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from			2
the condition of the drone in the video suggests it was not shot down but suffered a system failure , aviation analyst @entity83 said			0
there are no burn marks from a fire , no holes and no outward damage			0
@entity83 noticed a dent along the leading edge but does n't know what that means			0
" it 's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated			0
the question is , did that happen in the accident or ( did they take ) them off to move the aircraft ? " @entity83 asked			0
the @entity40 and the @entity33 would not comment on the video shown thursday			2
a senior @entity2 official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the unmanned aircraft said it was tasked to fly over western @entity43 and look for insurgent activity , with no directive either to fly into @entity0 or spy on @entity0 from @entity43 airspace			1
a @entity2 satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone , which apparently sustained significant damage , the senior official said			1
@entity0 's @entity123 ambassador said in a letter thursday that the drone flew 250 kilometers ( 150 miles ) into @entity0 territory " to the northern region of the city of @entity129			2
" the letter from @entity132 @entity131 to @entity123 @entity133 and the heads of the @entity135 and @entity136 said the drone " faced prompt and forceful action " by the armed forces			0
" my government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the @entity2 government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the @entity0 in clear contravention of international law , in particular , the basic tenets of the @entity149 , " @entity131 's letter said			1
he called for @entity123 condemnation of @entity2 " acts of aggression , " as well as " clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the @entity149 ' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security			0
