-- police officers do heroic , often frightening work			1
and they do it for our sake -- to protect us			0
so , first of all , thank you			0
but the fact is that police in the @entity9 are killing far too many people			1
in the aftermath of @entity15 's killing in @entity16 , there has been much discussion about race relations , the justice system , gun ownership and other factors that may have played a role in the incident			1
but the most urgent issue , the one that demands the most immediate attention , is the frequency with which police in this country shoot suspects , guilty or not			1
the difference in the number of killings in the @entity9 and the rest of the world is startling			1
while police in other major countries typically kill a few people every year , the numbers here are enormous			1
( more on that in a moment			0
) in the @entity9 , hundreds of people are killed by law enforcement every year			1
a large percentage of them are mentally ill. and although all ethnic groups have become victims , minorities are getting shot in numbers much greater than their proportion in the population			0
how many people are shot by police every year ? nobody seems to know the exact number ( something that is itself disturbing -- no official government agency tracks the full data for the entire country )			1
the @entity61 , compiling voluntarily submitted data from 750 out of 17,000 law enforcement agencies , reports about 400 " justifiable homicides " by police each year			2
that figure , of course , is incomplete and does not include killings deemed " unjustifiable , " or shootings that do not result in death			2
police officers are not necessarily guilty of misconduct when someone is killed			2
in most cases , they are following training and protocol when they shoot			2
but unless you believe that it is acceptable for police to kill hundreds every year -- people who still deserve due process even if they are guilty -- there is surely a need to review and revise those protocols			1
of course , there are situations in which police have no choice but to shoot to kill -- where members of the public or officers themselves are in imminent danger			1
but it should only happen when there is no other reasonable way to save the officer 's life or other people 's lives			2
in other cases , shooting to incapacitate -- or not shooting at all -- may be a better option			0
unfortunately there are far too many cases where our consciences have been shocked			0
take the case of a man widely reported to have had mental health issues , who was shot and killed not far from @entity16 after allegedly stealing a doughnut and a couple of energy drinks just two weeks after @entity15 's death			0
he asked police " shoot me ! shoot me ! " what he likely needed was medical care			1
many will have seen the images of a 12 - year - old boy who was shot last month in @entity125 after someone called police saying he was pointing a gun at people			1
the caller reportedly added that the gun was probably fake			0
it was indeed a toy , but the boy is dead			0
there has to be a better way			0
official nationwide statistics do n't exist for the number of people who have been killed who were suffering from a mental illness , but my own analysis of 2,800 entries compiled by the private @entity143 project suggests that almost 500 of those killed were mentally ill. of those killed by law enforcement officials , 853 were white , 673 @entity147 , 305 @entity148 , 4 @entity149			1
many remain uncategorized , so the breakdowns are inexact , but the numbers are telling			0
regardless of ethnicity , every one of these people , guilty of a crime or not , died without a trial			2
some experts say police should aim not for the legs or arms but for the torso , the largest target in the body , which improves the odds of stopping an assailant			2
but the sheer number of deaths of unarmed suspects , or knife - wielding individuals who were not within reach of the officer , surely demands a rethink of the policy			1
in many cases , shooting to incapacitate would be sufficient and at least worth trying			0
of course , a split - second decision is difficult in the heat of the moment			2
that 's why thorough training is indispensable			0
on average , at least one person is killed by a cop every day in the @entity9 in contrast , not a single one was killed in @entity184 last year , where police fired their guns a grand total of three times , according to @entity189			1
in 2011 , when the @entity61 reported 404 justifiable law enforcement homicides in the @entity9 , police killed six people in @entity193 , two in @entity195 , six in @entity196			1
it goes without saying that no two countries are exactly the same , and the @entity9 has its own specific characteristics , and many of the factors raised in the wake of the @entity16 case are valid and deserving of attention			1
but in addition to the obvious costs in human lives and the weakening of trust in police and the legal system , the killings must surely be taking a toll on police officers			2
one can only imagine the emotional burden of having shot a civilian			0
cops have incredibly stressful jobs , particularly in the @entity9 , where guns abound and thousands of people are shot to death every year			1
last year , 30 police officers were killed			2
we should therefore consider ourselves in the debt , not only of the brave men and women who are putting their lives on the line , but their families as well			0
so we should not see it as putting cops on trial when we review the system as a whole			0
but it is also in the interests of officers themselves that we engage in a systemic quest for solutions			0
the first step in this process should be to start keeping proper and comparable statistics , which would allow us see where the problem is most severe , how the numbers are trending , and where police departments are doing a particularly good job , so that they might share best practice			1
this would make it easier to review procedures and protocols			0
ultimately , our law enforcement officers should only kill people when there is no other alternative			1
yes , in the heat of the moment mistakes will sometimes be made			0
but the scale of what is happening now is unacceptable .			0
