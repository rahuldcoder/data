-- much as i love the @entity3 — and i love it thiiiiiiiis much ! — it is not a physical space			2
and no factor so directly and causally affects us as our physical space			2
the temperature in your room determines which drawers you 'll open when you 're choosing your clothes			2
the location of your stove determines where you 'll cook			2
the distance to the front door determines the magnitude of the interruption when someone knocks			2
the fact that stores are away from our homes explains entire concepts like " errands			0
" half of what i find annoying in life is due to things not being near me when i want them			1
the space we 're in is deeply determinative of the lives we lead			0
so , when a ceo says that i ca n't work at home any more , it 's very much like being fired from one job and hired for another without anyone asking if i agree to the deal			1
ceo right : @entity44 workers must show up for me , this is ultimately the arrogance of @entity47 's mandate that @entity44 employees can no longer work from home			1
which is a way of saying that i want to skip two other arguments			0
the first is about whether letting people work from home is good or bad for a business			0
i think we all agree that physical proximity breeds an intimacy that online connections can not , and it enables sustained creative development that online interactions inhibit			0
policy riles workers everywhere except we do n't all agree			1
for instance , i do n't			0
i 've worked at home for many years over the past couple of decades , and i do n't believe i always work better in an office			1
after all , the main point of space is to keep things apart , whereas the @entity71 only exists as a set of connections			0
and the net as a social platform is getting so sophisticated that for many sorts of ideas at many stages of development , it makes the real world look like a big box of 404s			0
( disclosure : i work in an office with hugely creative people and enjoy it			0
) slightly more scientifically : the research data on this topic are hard to generalize from			0
for example , studies that show that dispersed coding teams work more slowly may simply be an indication that these dispersed teams need better tools or management			0
and perhaps in particular circumstances a balanced approach — together tuesdays ! — might work			0
so , that 's the first argument i do n't want to have			1
who works from home and how they do it the second is about whether @entity47 is a hypocritical , entitled , privileged , spoiled 1 % ' er because she gets to bring her infant to work with her			0
the content of her character is irrelevant to whether she 's made a good decision			1
even entitled 1 % ' ers are sometimes right			0
so let 's not have that argument either			1
instead i want to ask what sort of decision @entity112 has made			1
point no. 1 is where we began : a change in place is one of the most profound changes one can make			1
imagine you are working at home and your company gives you the choice of either working 9 to 5 in the office or moving to another state where you will be allowed to telecommute			0
i personally would have considered moving			0
but the point is that those two choices are roughly equivalent for many of us			0
that 's how big a deal it is to be told to show up for work every day			1
it 's a big , big deal			1
a work - at - home mom defends @entity44 's @entity112 point no. 2 is that @entity112 clearly has issued this edict to send a signal			1
otherwise , she would have announced that @entity44 is going to re-evaluate the work - at - home folks on an individual basis			1
if your job passes the test , congrats , you can stay in your bathrobe			0
but requiring everyone to show up all the time is a signal expressed as a policy			0
the problem is that if you send a signal by , say , firing off a flare , you 're supposed to aim the flare well over the heads of the folks in the lifeboat			2
if you aim it at them and set some of them on fire , it 's not a signal any more			2
it 's an assault with a bright weapon			2
opinion : allow @entity44 workers to work at home so , while @entity112 has successfully signaled that @entity44 is desperate , the signal contains other messages , as well			1
the first message is that she distrusts her employees , and distrusts the @entity71			0
the second is that she does n't understand how important where one works is to an ordinary person 's life — not just to the quality of one 's life , but to the substance of it			1
this is odd since she herself has said that for her , family comes before @entity44			1
third , she has signaled that sending signals is her idea of substance			2
especially since to the recipients , they are not signals but wrenching changes in what is the most important element of our lives : our place			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 : @entity112 shows arrogance to require @entity44 workers to come in
if you 've signed on for telecommuting , *banning* it is like a firing and *rehiring* , he says
@entity112 signals @entity44 is desperate , he says , but it conveys *disdain* for workers
@entity202 : she seems *unaware* how important " place " is to an ordinary person 's life
