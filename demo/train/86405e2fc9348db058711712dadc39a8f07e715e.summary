he was an adviser to presidents , serving on commissions concerning civil rights , immigration and military clemency issues			1
( and , incidentally , angering @entity55 over a report about racial discrimination , which prompted @entity0 's resignation			1
) in 1962 , he made the cover of @entity60 -- back when that was one of mainstream @entity63 's most powerful indicators of influence -- for a story about @entity21 intellectuals			2
he was even one reason that the former @entity68 ended up as advice columnist @entity69			0
as she told the story , when she applied for the position , she was given a handful of letters to answer as a test			2
for help on some topics she called her friends , including @entity81 justice @entity79 and @entity82			0
needless to say , she got the job			0
@entity0 , a close friend , remained one of the column 's go - to experts			1
but @entity0 's primary focus was always the school he loved and first attended when he was 16			1
at the time -- the mid- 1930s -- the college in @entity90 , @entity91 , was known for its football team , its seminary and little else			0
@entity0 , a native of @entity95 , @entity96 , graduated from a university in @entity98 , @entity99 , and was ordained in 1943			1

" " the @entity21 university should be a place where all the great questions are asked , where an exciting conversation is continually in progress , where the mind constantly grows as the values and powers of intelligence and wisdom are cherished and exercised in full freedom , " he once wrote			2
people we 've lost in 2015 he used @entity2 's athletic fame for bigger ends			1
the number of students doubled during his tenure			2
a library now named for him opened in 1963			0
its famous mural , visible from @entity2 's football stadium , is referred to as " @entity136			1
" and when he started at @entity2 , its endowment was $ 9 million			1
today it stands at close to $ 10 billion , the 12th - largest in the country			0
" the great challenge ... at @entity2 was to create the greatest @entity21 university of all time			1
and i think we achieved that , " he told @entity147 of @entity90 tv station @entity148 , a @entity1 affiliate			0
there was criticism , of course			0
he traveled so much he became the subject of a campus joke : @entity155 is everywhere , @entity0 is everywhere but @entity2			1
he disliked the @entity157 - era campus protests and threatened to expel students who were too disruptive			0
he sometimes butted heads with @entity21 leaders			0
but he was , usually , beloved -- not least by the @entity2 community			1
he was known for his availability to students and liked to chat with them			0
perhaps his greatest influence " was on the lives of generations of @entity2 students , whom he taught , counseled and befriended , " said @entity11 , the @entity2 president , in his statement			1
he was amply honored during his long life			0

for all his influence , @entity0 never saw himself as high and mighty			1
his calling was service , and that alone was enough			0
" i never wanted to be anything but a priest , which is in itself a great and unearned grace , " he said			0
" i hope to live and die a priest , nothing more , but nothing less either			0
