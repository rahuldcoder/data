-- can mounting radar sensors or cameras on cars help prevent some traffic jams ? new research suggests so			1
when a car slows quickly and unexpectedly , it can trigger a chain reaction in the cars behind it and create traffic slowdowns			1
it does n't take construction or a fender - bender to disrupt traffic on a highway , just one driver hastily hitting his brakes			1
but @entity20 professor @entity19 has developed an algorithm he thinks can be used by cars to better reduce these kinds of " phantom " traffic jams : slowdowns not caused by obvious culprits like accidents or road repairs			1
using @entity19 's system , multiple cars would detect the velocity and distance of the cars in front and behind them and then regulate their speed to avoid sudden braking and maintain a more consistent speed			1
@entity19 told the @entity40 that one driver braking suddenly can have a ripple effect , increasing in amplitude , on the line of cars behind them , even if the driver just hit the brakes for a moment			0
completely autonomous car technology is under development at universities , car companies and even @entity53			0
but @entity19 's system is n't just for cars in the far - off future			2
he believes that it could be used by existing vehicles that have a feature called adaptive cruise control , which is found on some high - end cars			0
cars with adaptive cruise control are outfitted with radar sensors or digital cameras on the front of the vehicle			1
they detect nearby cars and gauge how far away they are and how fast they 're going			0
in addition to keeping a preset speed , a car with adaptive cruise control automatically adjusts the brakes and throttle to stay a safe distance from the cars ahead of it			2
the system is great for people who often hit stop - and - go traffic during their commutes			2
it can slow down when necessary to avoid accidents and rev back up to the maximum desired cruising speed			0
but @entity19 's system would take this a step further by adding sensors on the back of the car as well			2
a car that stays roughly halfway between those in front of it and behind it would be less likely to pass on any disruptions in speed to the car behind it			0
@entity19 describes his system as " bilateral control , " and it works best when a lot of cars on the road are using it			2
the algorithm takes into account other human factors , like drivers ' reaction time and typical behaviors such as speeding up to close gaps between cars			0
@entity19 , who researches computer vision , came up with the idea to create a computer simulation of these types of traffic issues after dealing with backups on interstates in @entity121			0
mounting cameras or sensors on cars is still a new and expensive technology , but it is a key part of automated driving advancements			1
in the future , cars could communicate with each other and share information about speed and traffic to better address issues that individual drivers ca n't fix on their own			1
@entity19 presented his findings this month at a transportation conference .			0

many traffic slowdowns are just chain reactions started by cars hastily slowing down
an @entity20 professor has developed a system for preventing these types of jams
cars with mounted cameras or sensors can track cars around them and better regulate speed
