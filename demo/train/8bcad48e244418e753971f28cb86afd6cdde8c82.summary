@entity0 could soon recognize a third gender category for the first time in the country 's constitution			1
" it is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender , " said @entity6 , the spokesperson of @entity7 , which is working on a new draft of the country 's constitution			1
" people should have [ that ] freedom to change sex and they should be equally protected by the @entity19 and the law and treated fairly			1
" third gender means that an individual does not have to identify as either male or female , and gives their right to self - identify			2
if enacted , @entity0 would join several @entity26 countries , including @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , that have recently moved to recognize third gender			1
this week , the @entity7 , a panel tapped by the current @entity0 military junta , started work on a new draft			1
the junta , which calls itself the @entity36 , took power in may after a military coup			0
the old constitution recognizes people of different religion , age , gender -- but had not extended to transgender people			1
" it is now time to recognize the existence of the third gender in @entity0 society , " said @entity6			1
" so we expand the region of protection as well			0
" " hopefully introducing third gender will help reduce discrimination in society			2
" the @entity7 is expected to consider various components of @entity0 law and submit it to review by april			1
the decision to legalize the @entity19 will be made on august 6			0
acceptance in @entity0 there 's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in @entity0 , due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery			1
but challenges still exist , several transgender people living in @entity64 told @entity1			2
" first of all in @entity0 , we 're pretty well - accepted , we can walk in the street and we do n't have to fear that someone 's going to shoot you in the head			1
at the same time , the most difficult thing is at a professional level , that people do n't accept people like us , " said @entity70 , a businessperson			2
it 's difficult for transgender people , despite their education level , to get hired and accepted by companies , she added			2
and matters like which locker room or bathroom to use become a human resources issue			0
and there is no legal recourse when discrimination occurs , because there have been no laws to protect them , said @entity88 , a transgender activist with the @entity89 in @entity64			0
another problem is that the gender marked on government documents does n't match how individuals identify their gender			2
when @entity88 travels , she gets pulled out of immigration lines for questioning by officials because of the gender marked on her passport			2
" for trans people , we can not change our title name			1
i 'm still a ' mister ' in my country			0
i can not change my title			0
my name is mr. @entity109 , " said @entity88 , a transgender woman			0
while recognizing the third gender would not resolve all the challenges , it would be " history " for our advocacy work , she added			0
more nations recognize third gender earlier last year , @entity27 's @entity118 granted the country 's transsexual and transgender individuals the right to self - identify their gender			1
@entity26 countries including @entity29 , @entity28 and @entity125 have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years			0
@entity127 started allowing a third gender option in passports in 2011			0
according to a 2012 report by the @entity132 , 20 countries have passed progressive legislation on the issue , including @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity137			0
even as transgender people are no longer forced to conform to specific genders in certain countries , they are still denied acceptance in many societies			0
same - sex marriage remains illegal in countries like @entity28 , @entity146 , @entity125 and @entity147			0
and @entity0 does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution , said @entity6 .			1
