-- a sensational strike from @entity3 captain @entity2 kept alive the co-hosts ' hopes of reaching the quarter finals of @entity7 as they held @entity8 to a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity8 had looked set for a second successive victory that would have sealed their place in the last eight , thanks to @entity15 's third goal of the tournament			1
@entity15 reacted quickest to glance home @entity18 's first - half free kick and take his place as the tournament 's top goalscorer			2
but @entity2 struck a superb left - foot equaliser on 57 minutes to earn @entity3 a second successive 1 - 1 draw and ensure that @entity25 remains wide open			1
earlier , @entity26 had kept their qualification hopes alive with a deserved 2 - 1 win over @entity30 , who can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat @entity8 in their final game			1
@entity26 2 - 1 @entity30 the @entity35 , needing a response following their 4 - 1 defeat to @entity8 , got off to a remarkably fast start			1
two goals in the opening six minutes saw them take immediate control of a game they were desperate to win			0
first , @entity43 took advantage of an incisive pass from @entity46 to fire past @entity30 goalkeeper @entity47			2
@entity30 conceded again three minutes later when lively full - back @entity48 cut in from the right and pulled the ball back beyond the grasp of @entity53 for @entity54 to bundle in			1
it was an even worse start than the @entity57 's first - half horror show against co-hosts @entity3 and when the beleagured @entity53 shuffled off to be replaced by @entity60 midway through the first half , it was hard to tell if he was injured or had simply had enough			1
either way , as it had been in their first game against @entity3 , @entity30 's first - half luck was completely out			2
proof of that was served when @entity69 headed in four minutes before half - time , only to see his effort ruled out for the narrowest of offsides			0
their luck slowly began to change after the break , though , and finally turned courtesy of a horrible mistake by @entity26 's highly experienced goalkeeper @entity79			0
the @entity81 goalkeeper appeared to have @entity83 ' low cross covered , but the presence of defender @entity85 seemed to distract @entity79 , who fumbled the ball to allow substitute @entity87 to roll the loose ball into an empty net			0
having fought back from a goal down and with only 10 men in their first game against @entity3 , @entity30 looked set to stage another second - half revival			2
but their approach play remained predictable and @entity79 , eager to make amends for his error , was never seriously threatened again			0
the victory means @entity99 's @entity26 side now have three points from two @entity25 games , but leaves @entity30 knowing that only a win against @entity8 in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages			1
@entity3 1 - 1 @entity8 tuesday may have been @entity8 day , but @entity2 's sensational equaliser ensured it became a national day of celebration in @entity3 too			1
the co-hosts remain unbeaten after a second successive 1 - 1 draw and @entity2 's 57th - minute thunderbolt provided a fitting hallmark to a hugely entertaining game			1
it ensured @entity3 took away the point they deserved , but it could have been more			0
the co-hosts made a lively start and the impressive @entity120 saw a crisp left - foot strike fly just over before @entity122 had a goal disallowed for offside			0
instead , it was @entity8 who took control eight minutes before half - time			2
@entity18 was the provider , his searching free - kick inviting @entity15 to ease through a crowded area and steer home a deft header			0
@entity8 looked set to build on that lead and @entity18 remained a constant threat , but too often his final pass proved wayward			0
that was a trait which ultimately came to haunt @entity8 as , from one such stray ball , @entity3 broke with devastating effect			0
when the ball finally found its way to @entity2 , he took one right - foot touch to set himself up for a shot before unleashing an unstoppable left - foot shot that flew past @entity147 keeper @entity146			0
@entity146 had no chance with that strike but rescued his side on three other occasions to ensure that @entity8 stay top of @entity25 -- but with everything to play for in saturday 's final round of group matches .			2

co-hosts @entity3 share 1 - 1 draw with @entity8 in @entity25
@entity2 scores stunning equaliser after @entity15 's opener for @entity8
@entity26 seal 2 - 1 win over @entity30 in early kick - off
