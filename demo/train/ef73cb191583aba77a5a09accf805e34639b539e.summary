when @entity1 , 24 , stepped out onto the stage at @entity4 's " @entity5 " finale tuesday night , some wondered if she had gone too far			1
while the show is known for its dramatic weight loss transformations -- most winners lose more than 50 % of their body weight -- @entity1 appeared extremely thin			1
and the looks on trainers @entity11 and @entity14 ' faces could be interpreted as shock -- or dismay			0
@entity1 went from 260 pounds to 105 pounds , losing 59.62 % of her body weight			1
at 5 feet , 5 inches tall , that puts her body mass index at 17.5			0
anything under 18.5 is considered by the @entity21 to be underweight			0
@entity4 on wednesday declined to comment on its $ 250,000 grand prize winner , a voice - over artist who lives in @entity24			1
social media , however , was buzzing			1
" are you kidding ? " one woman wrote on the show 's @entity29 page			2
" @entity31 looks anorexic ! she has gone from one extreme to the other ! " other posts called @entity1 " frail " and said she seemed " dizzy " and " disoriented " on stage			0
" she obviously worked incredibly hard to achieve her weight loss goals , but i am wondering if the pressure of winning a large cash prize caused her to take it too far , " one said			2
others posted on @entity1 's @entity29 page , asking her to get help and expressing disappointment			2
" i 'm saddened that my 13 - year - old daughter watched as you were rewarded for doing that to your body , " one woman said			2
@entity1 as of wednesday had not responded to the posts and had not commented on the controversy on @entity52			0
@entity14 issued a statement late wednesday on social media on behalf of herself and @entity11 , saying , " @entity11 and i want to take a moment to congratulate all of the @entity56 on their hard work			1
we 're not comfortable commenting on @entity60 's journey because ( we ) were n't her trainers and were n't given an opportunity to work with her at any point			2
any questions about the contestants on the @entity5 should be directed to the show 's producers			1
" asked by another @entity52 user whether she was concerned about @entity1 's weight , @entity14 posted , " we wo n't comment because we had nothing to do with it and want no part in shaming someone with ' public statements			1
' " @entity76 : opinion : dropping pounds nothing like ' @entity5 ' @entity80 applies less on an individual level and is more utilized for population norms -- many people , such as marathon runners or endurance athletes have low bmis and are perfectly healthy			1
and some people who eat well and exercise normally are just naturally thin			0
however , losing a significant amount of weight using unhealthy methods can be dangerous , said experts unfamiliar with @entity1			1
it 's the darker side of weight loss -- as obesity is unhealthy , so is being underweight			1
" can you be too thin ? yes			0
can it be as dangerous as being too fat ? yes , " said dr. @entity97 , weight management expert and medical director of @entity101 's @entity100 for @entity102			1
severe weight reduction can result in hormone disruption or bone thinning ( reduction in bone density ) and can affect women 's fertility , as they stop menstruating , said @entity97 and dr. @entity110 , clinical director of the @entity111 in @entity112			1
@entity110 said most of his patients lose about 30 % of their body weight over the course of a year			0
" on the other end , i have patients with a @entity80 of 30 that are in perfectly good health , " he said @entity97 notes the television show is about extremes , " not what we as a profession are looking at			0
" but " if i were to see this in a patient , i would be concerned about their emotional stability , " he said			0
@entity1 is " just below that lower end " on the @entity80 scale , @entity110 said			0
" not watching the show ... i really could n't say whether she 's unhealthy , or she should n't weigh that much			1
because she very well could have a healthy lifestyle			0
" still , " there are some people who we see for weight management who develop disordered eating , " he said			0
" it 's like a pendulum and they swing to the other end ... i do n't see a lot of those patients , but i do see them			2
" such patients are afraid to gain any weight because of their fear of again becoming obese , he said			2
the real message , said @entity97 , " is that people should appreciate that when they are overweight they do n't have to lose 100 pounds to improve their overall health , that small changes in body weight can have a very sigificant impact on blood sugar , cholesterol			0
" they should n't think that if they ca n't lose 100 pounds they should n't try			0
" ' @entity5 ' trainer : dumbbells and diets do n't get you in shape			2

social media is buzzing over " @entity5 " winner 's *155* - pound drop
losing a lot of weight with unhealthy methods can be dangerous , experts say
being too thin can be as dangerous as being obese
