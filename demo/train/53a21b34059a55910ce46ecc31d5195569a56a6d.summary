@entity0 , @entity1 -- all that glitters is not gold , and not all designer jewelry is made from precious metals and gemstones			1
a few years ago , @entity9 's love of traditional @entity11 designs led her to her ancestral home in @entity1 's capital of @entity0 , giving up her career in electrical engineering in the @entity16			1
once in the country , the @entity16 - born designer started @entity19 , a luxury label producing high - end jewelry and accessories made from a variety of materials , including ankole cow horns			1
used for centuries for their milk and meat , ankole cows are indigenous to @entity30			1
yet once they are slaughtered their striking long horns are usually discarded -- and this , @entity9 thought , represented a sustainable business opportunity			2
" if it were n't for making something out of cow horn it would have been disposed of , " says @entity9			2
" typically in @entity30 we tend to burn a lot -- our garbage , our waste is burnt and it 's not environmentally friendly at all so i just thought of collecting it and transforming it into something beautiful			1

@entity9 says that all the products are handmade by a small dedicated team of local artisans			2
" @entity19 means illuminate the source , the source being @entity30 , where we have an abundance of beautiful materials , an abundance of amazing craftsmanship , " says @entity9			1
" we are losing a lot of our heritage , our culture and our artisans , in a sense , are kind of losing hope , " she adds			0
" so we are trying to get that artisanal craftmanship and keep it			0
" alongside the cow horn , @entity9 sources other traditional materials for her designs , such as imported leather from @entity78 and beads from @entity80			2
yet doing business from @entity0 has not been without problems			0
" i would say timeliness is the biggest challenge , " says @entity9			0
" trying to get your products to market in a short space of time and be competitive			2
" regional trade @entity1 , often described as the " pearl of @entity30 , " is one of the continent 's most beautiful nations			1
the landlocked country , however , is also one of @entity30 's poorest -- according to a 2009 report by the @entity98 , 38 % of the population lives below the poverty line			1
the country is part of @entity102 , a trading bloc of 19 nations in east and southern @entity30			2
its free trade arrangements are designed to allow regional trade to flow easily between the member countries			0

but transporting goods is one of the key problems due to crumbling roads and expensive air travel			0
for @entity122 , accessing information and understanding how the trade bloc can benefit young entrepreneurs has been problematic			2
" i had to go directly to the ministry of trade to find out about the tariffs for example , how to import , " explains @entity9 , who already trades with many of the countries in the @entity102 trading bloc			0
" so it was more proactive , actually going out to seek that information			0
" putting businesses on the map @entity1 's ministry of trade says it knows the system is far from perfect but insists much is being done to improve the availability of information to businesses in the country			1
" we have promoted the district commercial offices because some of these small and medium - sized enterprises are out in the rural areas , " says @entity138 , minister of trade , industry and cooperatives			0
" so they are able to access them and give them information about the market standards and the necessary facilitation that they need			0
" read this : artist gives trash a second chance although still a work in progress , @entity9 says she sees the potential for her future if @entity1 's regional trading relations continue to grow , especially when it comes to distributing her products			1
" it will impact the business greatly , " she says			0
" if we can get import and export of the products smoothly and in a timely manner , an affordable manner and understanding what tax breaks we can get from doing business in such a way that will be fantastic , " adds @entity9			0
" it will enable us to be put on the map			0
