-- each year , nearly 10,000 high school athletes in the @entity2 suffer heat - related illnesses that require medical attention and cause them to miss practice or games , according to a report released today by the @entity8			1
fully two - thirds of those cases occur in august , according to the report , and roughly 80 percent of the stricken athletes are football players , who at this time of year are often slogging through grueling preseason workouts			1
with temperatures hovering in the 90s and beyond , dehydration and heat exhaustion while exercising are a very real -- and potentially dangerous -- threat			1
and competitive athletes are n't the only ones who can experience problems when the mercury and humidity peak			1
even if they 're in excellent shape , weekend warriors may find themselves suffering heat - related symptoms after a long run or even a day of lawn mowing and yard work			1
@entity0 : 10 easy ways to burn calories this summer " people get out there and ... do a really hard workout , " says @entity33 , a certified athletic trainer in @entity34 , @entity35			0
" the sensible thing is to go slow , and work up progressively			0
... a lot of people even go indoors and cross-train if it 's too hot			2
" not everyone has access to a climate - controlled gym , however			2
if your only option is to exercise outdoors despite the torrid weather , you can take some steps to avoid problems such as dehydration , cramping , heat exhaustion , and -- because air quality gets worse on hot , muggy days -- breathing trouble			1
how heat and humidity take a toll when your body gets overheated , its natural response is to sweat			2
and when that sweat evaporates off your skin , it lowers your body temperature			1
but if the temperature or humidity is sky - high , this built - in cooling system can break down			1
sweat does n't evaporate properly because of all the moisture in the air , and your skin does n't release body heat as effectively			1
" you 're still sweating , but it 's not doing as much for your body temperature , " says @entity74 , @entity75 , director of the @entity76 at the @entity77 , in @entity78			1
as your body temperature climbs , lightheadedness , dizziness , nausea , fatigue , and muscle cramps can result			1
all of these are signs of heat exhaustion			1
and if you do n't cool off quickly -- by going into an air - conditioned building or drinking cold water , say -- heat exhaustion can sometimes turn into heat stroke			1
@entity0 : 15 big benefits of water heat stroke occurs when your body temperature hits 105 degrees			1
the condition can cause problems in the muscles , kidneys , liver , brain , and heart , and people with heat stroke often start to breathe quickly and behave erratically , @entity74 notes			1
if they do n't get medical help and bring their body temperature down , they may even have a seizure or slip into a coma			1
in extreme cases heat stroke can be deadly			1
if you or someone you 're with start to experience the symptoms of heat stroke , seek medical attention immediately or call 911			1
when is it safe to exercise outdoors ? it 's important to watch the temperature , but the most relevant number you need to know before heading outdoors is the heat index , which takes humidity into account and represents how hot it feels			1
the risk of muscle cramping and heat exhaustion rises as the heat index climbs above 90			1
although less serious than heat exhaustion , cramping is dangerous , especially when you 're dehydrated			1
" when you start cramping and do n't have enough fuel in the tank , that can lead to something more serious , like pulling a muscle , " @entity33 says			2
when the index is higher than 100 , heat stroke also becomes more likely			1
in the @entity143 , where @entity33 conditions and trains high school football players , the index is almost always in the danger zone , and it 's not uncommon for it to reach 105			1
it 's really important to modify your exercise routine when the index is that high , @entity33 says			2
@entity0 : fun in the sun workout @entity33 recommends scaling back the duration or intensity of your workouts once the hot weather hits			2
it takes about two weeks to get acclimated to exercising in the heat ( especially if you 're not in top shape to begin with ) , he says			2
after that period , you 're free to gradually ramp back up			0
when it 's really hot out , @entity74 advises , it 's a good idea to take breaks more frequently , exercise in the shade whenever possible , and wear breathable and light - colored clothing			2
exercising in the heat is safe if you use common sense and follow some basic rules , @entity74 says			2
" as long as they 're not working [ out ] too hard , someone who is well rested , hydrated , and nourished can tolerate pretty tough conditions , " he says			0
stay hydrated the most important thing to do while working out in the heat is to stay hydrated			2
that may seem obvious , but hydrating properly is more complicated than you may think			0
for starters , you should drink plenty of fluids before and after your workout , not just during			0
@entity33 tells his football players to hydrate throughout the day to prepare for their 4 p.m. practices , and to drink 16 to 20 ounces of water or a sports drink ( like @entity191 ) one hour before practice			0
@entity0 : drink this for a better run during your workout , you should consume 4 to 16 ounces of fluids every 15 to 20 minutes , according to the @entity196			0
sports drinks -- which contain lots of sugar and additives in addition to the electrolytes that help keep you hydrated -- are most beneficial during prolonged exercise , @entity74 says , and it 's sometimes wise to alternate them with water			0
do n't rely on your thirst to tell you when to drink			2
" people let thirst drive them to drink , but it is n't enough to match what they are losing [ by sweating ] , " @entity74 says , adding that if you start feeling thirsty , you 're already dehydrated			2
food is also important for staying hydrated			0
eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day -- especially foods such as bananas that contain potassium and other vital nutrients ( in addition to water ) -- will help prep your body for a workout in the heat			2
" maintaining good hydration is key to safety in the heat , but it is not all protective , " @entity74 says			0
@entity229 took part in has shown that even if kids are well hydrated , they can overheat and even experience heat stroke if they exercise too intensely and get hot too quickly			1
" you can still overheat and have serious problems when you are well hydrated , " he explains			0
protect your lungs dehydration and heat exhaustion are n't the only hazards of exercising on hot days			1
the stagnant air caused by heat and humidity tends to trap airborne pollutants , such as car exhaust , which react in the presence of sunlight to form ozone , a main ingredient in smog			0
working out in smoggy air can cause lung trouble in people with respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity254 )			0
but even in people without lung conditions , hard exercise on days with lots of smog can reduce lung function and create a reaction akin to an asthma attack , says @entity263 , @entity264 , chief medical officer of the @entity265			0
@entity0 : 7 surprising triggers of lung trouble " ground - level ozone is an irritant			0
if you breathe in too much , it irritates the nose , throat , and lungs , " @entity263 says			0
" it 's like you 're getting a sunburn in your airways			0
@entity278 promotes inflammation of the airways , and they get red and swollen			0
" a partnership of government agencies publishes daily air - quality forecasts for every zip code in the @entity2 at @entity285 , ranking air quality on a six - point , color - coded scale ranging from green ( " good " ) to dark red ( " hazardous " )			1
the green and yellow ( " moderate " ) levels are normal for most of the country during the summer , @entity263 says			0
the orange level can cause problems in people who are sensitive to ozone ( like asthmatics ) , however , and on red days he recommends that everyone stay indoors to exercise			0
" it 's important not to macho it , " he says			0
" lots of people say , ' i 'm feeling tight in the chest , but i can run through it			0
' but the more you run , the more bad air you take in , and if you have [ sensitive ] airways it can be very irritating			0
" if you have to exercise outdoors , the best time to do it is early in the morning , @entity263 says			0
he also suggests avoiding heavily trafficked roads to reduce the pollutants you inhale			0
and if you have asthma or other chronic lung disease , talk with your doctor about your exercise routine and make sure you have a plan in case you experience breathing problems			0

each year , nearly 10,000 high school athletes in the @entity2 suffer heat - related illnesses
dehydration and heat exhaustion are n't the only hazards of exercising on hot days
