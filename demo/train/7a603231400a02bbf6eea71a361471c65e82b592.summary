-- any baseball fan who has been alive in the last decade is familiar with a truism : " that 's just @entity4 being @entity4			2
" it has been used to describe one of the best outfielders in baseball history , @entity6 , who -- like a certain vice president -- had a way of stumbling into ( and creating ) some truly terrible press			2
like @entity12 , @entity6 was colorful , beloved and often forgiven			1
he could be endearing , running an @entity15 flag out onto the field with a wide boyish smile after becoming a @entity15 citizen			0
he was certainly amusing , retreating into the @entity19 at @entity21 's @entity20 during the games to take a call , or high - fiving a fan in the middle of a play			0
sometimes his antics were cringe - worthy			0
there was the time he successfully stole second base , but effectively " returned " it when he was thrown out inexplicably jogging back to first			0
and occasionally , @entity6 was a legitimate problem : shoving aging traveling secretary @entity34 over a ticket request , faking injuries to get out of key games , violating the league 's drug policy and blasting his own team in the media			1
eventually shrugging off " @entity4 being @entity4 " became harder and harder to do			0
@entity12 , however , still seems to get away with " being @entity12			0
" until now , maybe			0
after criticizing key @entity43 allies in our fragile @entity45 coalition -- including @entity47 , @entity48 , the @entity49 and @entity50 at a time when muscling the resolve to go after the terrorist fighters in @entity54 and @entity55 is a heavy lift for everyone involved -- @entity12 's " gaffe " is one that could come with significant consequences			1
he quickly offered apologies to @entity47 and the @entity49 for suggesting at a @entity64 forum that they had inadvertently helped strengthen @entity65			0
issuing public apologies -- especially when technically @entity12 's assertions are true , if incomplete -- is an unequivocal embarrassment for the @entity69 , which has been defending itself against criticism of incompetence all year			1
not to mention that getting this coalition together in the first place was , as @entity12 might say , a big effing deal			2
and so , slamming our partners in a nakedly political attempt to defend president @entity79 's policies to a group of college students understandably did n't sit well with our friends overseas			1
@entity12 seems to have a hard time remembering that he is a proxy for the president and the policies of the @entity15			2
in fact , back in 2012 , @entity12 explained his spontaneous declaration that @entity79 was " absolutely comfortable " with same - sex marriage -- well before @entity79 was ready to -- this way , according to @entity92 's book " forcing the @entity93 : " " i did n't go out volunteering a position , but when asked a question ... i had to respond to it			1
" except , of course , that @entity12 did volunteer a position , not just his own but the president 's			2
it was a moment that so confounded and infuriated the administration that @entity102 accused him of " downright disloyalty , " according to @entity92 's book			0
publicly , anyway , @entity79 put on a happy face , saying he would have " preferred to have done this in my own way , on my own terms , " but " all 's well that ends well			0
" unlike @entity12 's other category of gaffes -- off - color blurting and uncomfortable racial stereotyping -- this one had real political consequences , but ultimately boiled down to what was merely an election - year headache for the president			1
now , though , @entity12 's undiplomatic slam against our @entity43 coalition could unravel an already precarious military and political partnership that the @entity79 administration has leaned on heavily to sell intervention both abroad and here at home			1
let 's hope they do n't decide this was just the excuse they needed to pull out altogether and once again leave the @entity15 to shoulder the burden of fighting terrorism in their own backyards .			1

@entity138 : baseball player @entity6 had *reputation* for stumbles , like @entity12
she says , with @entity6 , as with @entity12 's recent gaffe , *snafus* could become problem
she says calling out @entity43 allies as strengthening @entity65 *threatens* fragile coalition
@entity150 : @entity12 must remember : he 's proxy for @entity79 . @entity152 's hope gaffe does n't do damage
