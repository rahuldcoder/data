@entity0 -- after 30 days and 63 prosecution witnesses -- including extortion victims , shooting victims , federal law enforcement agents , former drug dealers , and families of alleged murder victims -- defense attorneys began making their case monday for @entity11 , allegedly @entity0 's most feared underworld crime boss			1
their first witness , a former @entity14 agent , testified that he was sent to clean up the " leaks " at the @entity14 in @entity0 in 1981 , and that one of his assignments , given by the special agent in charge , was to evaluate @entity11 as an informant and perform a " suitability study			1
" after an evaluation , he recommended " terminating " @entity11 as an informant			1
" you have a guy telling you he is not an informant ... telling you he has his own gang ... he pays , they ( the @entity14 ) do n't pay him , " @entity24 , the former agent , said monday			1
" that automatically , in my opinion and according to the book , would nullify him as a trusted informant			0
" " you may call him an informant by name			0
according to the bureau , according to the file , he is an informant , " @entity36 , who spent more than 20 years with the @entity14 , said before a federal jury in @entity0 on monday			1
he ultimately recommended that @entity11 's file be closed			1
on cross-examination , prosecution attorney @entity41 asked @entity36 rhetorically , " you would n't go to close a window if it was n't open right ? " much of @entity11 's trial has been focused on whether he was an open informant for the @entity14 in @entity0 for two decades during the time prosecutors say he reigned over crime in @entity0 , participating in 19 murders , racketeering , extortion and money laundering -- all of which he has been charged with			1
the prosecution previously introduced a 700 - page document that suggests @entity11 was an informant			1
that assertion has been the crux of the prosecution 's case , which wrapped up friday			1
the defense argues that @entity11 had @entity14 agents on his payroll to protect him from wiretaps and indictments , but he never fed any information to the @entity14			1
defense attorney @entity67 's line of questioning indicated that @entity11 's counsel is attempting to shift the pendulum , and put the @entity14 on trial for corruption			1
the defense called @entity36 , 73 , to testify about being called in 1981 to " stop the leaking in @entity0			0
" " inside and outside @entity14 , " there was a " leaking of information , causing lots of investigations to go south , " @entity36 said			2
he was assistant special agent in charge , head of the drug task force and white collar crime section of the @entity14 in @entity0			1
describing himself as a whistle - blower , he detailed instances when he tried to report leaks and corruption within the @entity14 in @entity0			2
in one instance , @entity36 testified , the @entity14 and government strike force attorneys were resisting his efforts to get an @entity14 informant into the witness protection program			1
" i was getting the impression that people were stonewalling our trying to get @entity98 out of harm 's way , " @entity36 said monday			0
@entity98 , one of @entity11 's former associates , agreed to cooperate with the @entity14 and implicate @entity11 in the murder of a wealthy @entity104 businessman			1
two days after @entity36 complained to his superiors that not enough was being done to put the man in witness protection , @entity98 was shot to death , along with a friend , @entity110 , who was driving him home			0
@entity11 's " surrogate son " and former associate , @entity114 , testified earlier in the trial that " @entity115 just kept shooting , " describing @entity98 's writhing , bullet - ridden body as " bouncing off the ground			2
" @entity11 was tipped off by his rogue @entity14 informant handler that @entity98 was cooperating with the @entity14 , according to testimony from disgraced @entity14 agents			1
@entity36 contends he was ultimately forced to resign from his post in @entity0 because he was being retaliated against after reporting to headquarters that his boss was leaking information about grand jury testimony			0
" the reason i left the @entity14 is because it was corrupt at that level , " he said			2
on cross-examination , sparks flew as prosecuting attorney @entity41 asked @entity36 immediately , " it 's fair to say you are a man who likes to make up stories ? " @entity41 argued that in @entity36 's memoir " betrayal , " the former agent falsely proclaims that he made the arrest of a mafia crime boss			0
@entity41 produced the @entity14 report in court that made no mention of @entity36 's name in the arrest report			2
@entity36 also contends in his book that he recovered the rifle used to shoot @entity41 prosecutor @entity41 brandished the 200 - page report on the @entity14 's website documenting the @entity41 assassination , which does not make one mention of @entity36			2
" where 's you ? " @entity41 asked @entity36			0
" i was on the scene when shot was taken , " he said			0
tension between attorneys is mounting as the trial gets into its final weeks			0
@entity41 used words as ammunition as he read passages from @entity36 's memoir amid a fiery line of questions			0
@entity11 's attorney , @entity164 , had to reinforce his partner @entity67 's objections at one point , adding , " apparently it takes two voices to get mr. @entity41 to stop talking			2
" @entity41 got @entity36 to admit that he was not working in the @entity14 during the time the government began to make its case against @entity11 , and said aloud to a very attentive jury , " you have nothing to do with the charges that bring us here today			1
" @entity36 is still in legal battles for his pension , which he lost as a result of being forced to resign five years early			0
on why he titled his book " betrayal , " he said , " i felt betrayed			0
" i think the government felt betrayed			0
" the @entity14 was betrayed			2
" the @entity182 was betrayed			0
" there was a lot of betrayal going on			0
" the defense plans to call at least 11 more witnesses , but the attorneys indicated that is subject to change			0
also monday , judge @entity191 heard arguments on a defense motion to sequester the jury			1
@entity41 said that it was " not necessary " to suggest this to the jury " at the 11th hour			0
" @entity164 replied that there has " never been a more widely publicized or sensational case in this district , " harkening to saturated media coverage and " statements that are so hyperbolic and prejudicial towards the defendant ... unlike anything anyone has seen			0
" @entity205 has not yet ruled on the motion @entity36 said he met with @entity11 only one time to evaluate him as an informant , and @entity11 did not give him any valuable information			1
he added that the only information he ever gleaned from @entity115 came from his @entity14 file , which was written by @entity11 's rogue @entity14 informant handlers , @entity213 and @entity214			1
@entity214 is serving time for leaking sensitive information that cost two cooperating witnesses their lives at @entity11 's hands			2
@entity213 was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony in 1998 in which he confirmed @entity14 misconduct			1
@entity213 , who reviewed all informant matters at the time , drove @entity36 to a meeting with @entity11 in january of 1981			1
@entity36 said @entity213 was " pumping him ( @entity115 ) up " to @entity36 , saying that @entity11 was a " great guy			2
" @entity213 previously testified he accepted more than $ 7,000 in cash and gifts from @entity115			0
@entity36 said that when he met @entity115 in a dark corridor in @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity11 was wearing a baseball cap -- " @entity0 of course " -- and sunglasses			2
@entity11 would not shake @entity36 's hand , he said			2
" that 's not a really nice way to start a conversation			0
" " most informants are really trying to help , " he said			0
" they are trying to do the job			0
i did n't get that from him at first			0
" so @entity36 asked him , " what are you doing for me ? " during a 30 - minute conversation , @entity36 said , @entity11 never once gave him any valuable information			2
" basically , he was not giving me info i was trying to get			0
... he was not responsive to what i was out there to get			0
" @entity11 " said he was leader of the gang , top guy			0
that resonated with me because , you know in the @entity14 , you ca n't have the head of the gang as an informant , because then you are validating the gang , you are a part of the management , if you will , " he said			1
@entity36 said @entity11 told him he would never testify , which is rare for an informant			1
" at one point , he ( @entity11 ) even said , ' i am not an informant			1
' at that point i made a mental reservation ... ' what am i doing here , what 's going on here ? ' " then @entity36 , who thought this was a private meeting , was " shocked " to see @entity214 , @entity11 's rogue @entity14 informant handler , who " popped up " out of nowhere at the meeting , which @entity36 said he was not entitled to attend			1
@entity214 served time on federal racketeering charges and is now in state prison serving 40 years on related murder charges stemming from his relationship with @entity11			0
he tipped off @entity115 and his crew that an associate , @entity98 , was cooperating with the @entity14 and implicating @entity11 in the @entity104 businessman 's murder			1
ultimately , @entity36 recommended @entity11 be closed as an informant			1
@entity36 gave the information to the special agent in charge , who passed the recommendation on to @entity285 @entity14 headquarters			2
headquarters determined that @entity11 was too valuable to taking down the @entity287 and decided to keep him open			0
@entity213 testified that he wrote a letter to headquarters to persuade them to keep @entity11 on as an informant because of all the help he was giving the @entity14 in taking down the @entity294 mafia , @entity295			1
the defense has argued that it was @entity11 's partner and henchman @entity297 who was providing information about the mafia , and that the information was put in @entity11 's file so that the @entity14 could preserve him as an informant			1
@entity36 testified that the only information he received from @entity115 was information he read in @entity11 's informant file , produced by rogue agents @entity214 and @entity213			2
he said he never had any reason " not to trust " the agents he worked with .			0
