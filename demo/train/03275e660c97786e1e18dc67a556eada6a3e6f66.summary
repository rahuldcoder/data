this week , @entity1 's mayor @entity0 tweeted his intent to learn computer code by the end of the year			1
he joined about 300,000 other people who have signed up at @entity6 to receive free interactive programming lessons each week from the @entity8 , a web - based tutorial			1
it 's time @entity12 begin treating computer code the way we do the alphabet or arithmetic			1
code is the stuff that makes computer programs work -- the list of commands that tells a word processor , a website , a video game , or an airplane navigation system what to do			1
that 's all software is : lines of code , written by people			1
we are socializing , working , consuming , and living in a world increasingly defined by programs			2
learning to code is the best way to understand what all those programs do , or even to recognize that they are there in the first place			1
just a couple of years ago , i was getting blank stares or worse when i would suggest to colleagues and audiences that they learn code , or else			1
" program or be programmed , " became my mantra : if you are not a true user of digital technology , then you are likely being used by digital technology			0
my suggestion that people learn to program was meant more as a starting point in a bigger argument			2
no , i did not expect @entity12 adults to take the two or three weeks required to get their heads around programming , much less the months of effort they 'd need to become proficient			1
but i wanted people to at least become aware of the digital systems on which we are conducting so much of our activity -- and the sorts of thinking and behaviors those systems have been programmed to encourage			0
class of 2011 scores higher - paying jobs most adults realize that , say , @entity74 is engineered to increase the value of our " social graphs " to its customers , the corporations and research firms that buy this data			2
we understand that we 're not the customers , but the product			2
the more critically we engage with all of the iphones and @entity86 searches in our lives , the better we can tell what they want from us			0
but i no longer think that 's enough			0
it took a few centuries after the invention of text for regular people to learn how to read and write			2
the printing press , which democratized print by reducing the cost of manuscripts , certainly helped			0
now that we live in a world with newspapers , road signs , package labels and drug inserts , almost no one still questions the idea that teaching kids to read is a good thing , or that basic literacy makes us more likely to create value for ourselves or our employers			1
well , we now live in a world with apps , networks , and stock market trading algorithms that we use , even though desperately few of us understand how they work			0
and while learning to code may have once been an arduous or expensive process , the college dropouts who developed @entity8 have democratized coding as surely as @entity124 democratized text			1
anyone can go to @entity8 and start learning and creating code through their simple , fun , interactive window , for free			1
how can it be free ? is this a charity ? no. it 's big business			2
as my friend , @entity134 -- ceo of @entity137 and founder of the startup showcase launch conference -- explained it to me , " the @entity142 cost of landing an individual programmer might be $ 50 - 100k for a large company			2
that 's taking into account advertising , headhunter fees , interviewing time and internal staff			0
" still , competition for the few programmers out there looking for work is very steep			2
so few @entity12 know how to program that firms like @entity86 and @entity74 are actually buying whole companies just for their code - literate employees , in what are known as " talent acquisitions			1
" according to @entity134 , each employee who understands how to code is valued at about $ 500,000 to $ 1 million toward the total acquisition price			2
one million dollars just to get someone who learns code			0
firms ' other strategy , of course , is to import @entity168 and @entity169 programmers , through a costly and often only temporary visa			0
( that 's because , unlike those countries , we do n't teach programming to students in the @entity12			1
at best we teach kids how to use programs that are already on the shelves			0
but that 's another article			0
) all @entity8 needs to do to make bank is connect those of us who complete its courses and are looking for work with the companies paying good money to find us			0
it 's a model that takes the cumbersome costs of education off the students , and puts them onto the companies benefiting from the skills we have learned			0
and it 's a model that could be applied to many other fields			0
so to anyone out there who says you ca n't get a job : you can have one			0
learning code is not about numbers and mathematics			1
it 's more like architecture , where you are presented with a puzzle problem such as " how do we get all these cars from this highway to that one without having to build a bridge across this river or putting an overpass next to the hospital ? " learning to code means being able to imagine a new way of using the camera in your @entity219 , or a new way for people to connect to each other , and then being able to bring that vision to reality			1
if you know how to code , you can get a high - paying job right now , or make valuable stuff right now			1
you will understand more about how the world works , and become a participating member in the digital society unfolding before us			0
you will be enabling @entity12 to compete effectively on both the economic and military frontiers , where we are rapidly losing our competitive advantage due to our failure to teach ourselves code			1
we should not have to wait for the @entity239 to be hacked by kids from @entity241 to learn this lesson			0
join @entity243 on @entity74 and follow updates on @entity245 .			0

@entity247 : @entity12 should be learning computer code the way we learn math
learning to code teaches us what programs do , how they 're used on us , he says
a free web - based interactive tutorial makes it possible
@entity247 : programmers in demand ; employers hire code - savvy workers from *abroad*
