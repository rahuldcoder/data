-- tensions often run high in top - level sports , but it is rare to see a team 's coach physically attack one of their own players			1
however , that was the bizarre situation in an @entity10 soccer match on wednesday -- and it has cost @entity13 coach @entity12 his job			1
the 51 - year - old has been sacked just six months after being tasked with turning around the fortunes of the top - flight team following an astonishing fight with young midfielder @entity19 during the @entity21 match against @entity22			1
@entity12 clambered into the dugout and attempted to punch the @entity24 after the 20 - year - old sarcastically applauded a decision to replace him , with @entity13 at that stage losing 2 - 0 against a team that has been relegated to the second division			1
@entity13 , which won the last of of its two @entity10 titles in 1969 , fought back to draw 2 - 2			1
it left " @entity13 " hovering above the bottom three and still needing a point from the last two rounds to ensure another season in @entity21 @entity35 president @entity34 dismissed former @entity37 and @entity38 coach @entity12 immediately after the match , with no successor yet announced			1
" ( in a ) few seconds , months of stress came out			0
i am sorry , because the manager has never made such actions			0
i have to take this decision for his goodwill , so he can understand he was wrong			0
no provocation can justify that reaction , " @entity34 said on @entity13 's media website			1
" with the due proportions , we will take serious disciplinary measures for @entity19 too			2
it is not up to me justifying @entity12 , but he has never done anything like that			2
" @entity12 's dramatic departure comes just months after he was signed in the hope of turning around the @entity61 team , which finished ninth last season			0
he replaced the fired @entity63 in november but has failed to significantly boost results , with the club 15th in the table , six points above the drop zone			0
" i am sorry to witness this in my 10th year at the club and i believe the manager 's contribution helped us to win in @entity75 and @entity76 , " @entity34 said after the match			2
" i believed we would have achieved safety from relegation tonight and , definitely , i was not expecting to take this decision tonight			0
this team requires more unity if we want to avoid relegation			0
i know that at this moment @entity12 is suffering more than anyone else and i want to respect the work he has done here for us			0
