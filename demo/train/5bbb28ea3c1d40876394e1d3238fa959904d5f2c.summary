if @entity1 ever takes up figure skating , he will know how @entity4 feels			1
the 14 - year - old racehorse , one of the greatest steeplechasers of all time and a two - time @entity10 winner , made his dressage debut at @entity13 's @entity12 on tuesday			1
dressage , which involves horse and rider working together to produce a complex " dance " routine marked by judges , is how @entity4 has been spending retirement since his last @entity22 race in 2012			1
@entity23 , a leading @entity24 event rider , has been helping the horse to learn the intricacies of a sport that rewards precision and poise above power and pace			1
" he 's changed shape a lot since we got him , " @entity23 told @entity31 in the build - up to @entity4 's demonstration dressage test at @entity34			1
" he had n't done any flat work at all			2
but he 's got a brilliant temperament and he 's very willing			2
he got the hang of it very easily			2
" he needed to soften his whole body -- he was just used to going in a straight line			2
so he 's done a lot of gymnastic exercises and things to supple him up			0
" he tries really hard			0
when you 've taught him something once , he remembers it			0
the hardest thing for him was the canter -- he only really knew about going fast			0
" having spent a career streaking past thousands of spectators lining a racecourse , @entity4 appeared a little unprepared for an indoor arena crowd as he took his first , dainty dressage steps at @entity34			1
" it 's the crowds being up high and so close , it 's quite intimidating , " @entity23 told the @entity56 afterwards			0
" he did n't show himself off to the best of his ability -- he got a bit of stage fright and shut down			0
" most horses who come into an arena like this have been doing it for eight or 10 years , and build up gradually			0
he 's been thrown in at the deep end			0
" @entity4 is not in contention for @entity69			1
@entity24 has one of the world 's leading dressage teams and no matter his racing pedigree , there simply is n't the time to bring him up to the required standard			1
instead , dressage is seen as a way to offer the horse an interesting retirement -- although that was n't met with universal approval when the decision was made , two years ago			2
owner @entity84 sent @entity4 to @entity23 's @entity86 yard in december 2012 , against the wishes of the horse 's longtime trainer , @entity88			1
the dispute over the horse 's future brought to an end a partnership responsible for almost a dozen major victories on the racecourse , a career bettered only by 1960s legends @entity99 and @entity100			0
now , by contrast , @entity23 says there is " no pressure " on @entity4 to perform to any standard in his new sport			1
" the main thing is the horse is happy and relaxed , " she said this week , " and he has a varied lifestyle			0

steeplechasing great @entity4 shows off some moves in his new sport , dressage
two - time @entity10 winner has been learning dressage since late 2012
dressage debut comes in a demonstration at the @entity12 in @entity13
no plans for @entity4 to add an @entity125 appearance to his many racing honours
