ours is a culture that loves to celebrate youth , but there are those 30 and older who will tell you that leaving one 's 20s behind is like a revelation			2
growing out of that decade often means growing out of bad decision - making , frustrated searching and feeling generally as though life 's a pinball machine -- and you 're the ball			1
as you age , hopefully you realize that what you 've lost in youthfulness you 've gained in wisdom			2
in the best scenarios , you know how to bounce back from bumps and are better at avoiding valleys			2
you appreciate your mistakes , but you 'll be damned if you 'll repeat them			2
as much as we 'd hoped she would , @entity24 never got that far			1
when she died at 27 last july , few truly knew the intimate details of her personal life			1
the public could really know only what we 'd read about , seen and heard -- that she was a troubled young woman struggling with drug and alcohol abuse and that whatever was plaguing her threatened to overshadow a superb talent			1
ahead of her standout performance via satellite at the @entity37 , the singer was enmeshed in negative press and a few in the media openly questioned how long she 'd survive			2
she went on to win five awards that night , including best new artist			2
she owned that evening and touched hearts with her look of utter amazement and how she fled into the arms of one of her back - up singers when she bested artists such as @entity50 and @entity51 for record of the year			1
the tragedy of @entity24 's passing was n't just that the predictions came true , or that we 'd lost an undeniably great talent , but also that she lost a fight so early in life			1
this was an artist who was blessed with the presence of someone who 'd seen it all and a voice from another lifetime , a woman who could write about and then sing to life some of love 's darkest sides			1
she sang us through our own rough spots and regrets , but could n't seem , in the public 's eye , anyway , to do the same for herself			0
@entity24 on losing @entity24 : ' you take every day as it comes ' " i do n't write songs because i want my voice to be heard or i want to be famous or any of that stuff , " @entity24 told @entity77 in a 2007 interview			1
" i write songs about things i have problems with and i have to get past them and i have to make something good out of something bad			0
" we ca n't pretend to know her struggle with alcohol or substance abuse , but we 've all felt some variant of the longing , loneliness , hurt and infatuation she put into her music			0
@entity24 presented those emotions in a visceral way with which we could connect			1
she could take a personal experience and strike a note of universal truth			0
take , for example , " rehab , " her @entity102 - winning but controversial track from her autobiographical second album " back to @entity107			0
" it 's about the time her management tried to get her sober and she refused			0
but it was the smirking wisecracks and stubborn defiance that had us singing along			0
on her jazzy 2003 debut " @entity124 , " it was the beautifully sung , detailed story of wounded pride on " @entity119 , " and the tsk'ing , sneering disappointment in a lover on " @entity123			0
" winehouse scores posthumous @entity126 " @entity127 " provided a sultry soundtrack for the flawed and self - critical while " @entity131 " is an anthem of resolve			0
the album 's title track , @entity24 explained in that 2007 interview , the aftermath of a broken love			1
her massive appeal was backed by strong production on both albums , thanks to collaborations with producers @entity142 and @entity144 , and of course that voice -- rich , evocative and captivating			0
those elements helped her songs ' content to shine ; everything 's discussed with brash honesty and often a sense of humor			0
" there 's no point in saying anything but the truth , " @entity24 told the @entity154 in 2004			1
" because , at the end of the day , i do n't have to answer to you , or my ex , or ... i should n't say @entity162 ... or a man in a suit from the record company			0
i have to answer to myself			0
" that frankness and headstrong independence is what we loved about her and could relate to			0
although some talked callously about her struggles , there was still an underlying hope that she 'd push past her problems			0
so when she could n't , her july 23 death felt to many like a sucker punch			1
at the time of her death , it appeared that @entity24 was focused on recovery			1
an inquest last fall ruled that she 'd died of alcohol poisoning and a family spokesman said at the time that " @entity24 was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol , and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time			1
" who knows what the next few years of her life could have brought			1
that question will always linger and is the difficulty of watching someone pass on so young -- those of us left living know just how much more life can bring			1
perhaps she would have found , as @entity201 wrote in 2008 , that " there are other , better things to romanticize than hard times and hard booze			0
" instead , we 're left to hope that when she died , she still felt the same way as she did when she spoke to @entity208 in 2010			2
holding on to nary an unfulfilled goal , she said , " if i died tomorrow , i would be a happy girl			2
" winehouse producer : i still hear her voice			0

@entity24 died a year *ago* today at 27
fans and fellow stars were *rooting* for her to continue to find *success*
the tragedy of her death was to watch a woman lose a battle so early in life
