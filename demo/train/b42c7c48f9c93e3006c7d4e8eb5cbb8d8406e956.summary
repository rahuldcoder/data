editor 's note : below is an excerpt from @entity5 's autobiography , " my remarkable journey , " published by @entity7 books			1
@entity5 anchors " @entity10 " at 9 p.m. et on @entity9			1
@entity5 , left , at age 10 with his younger brother , @entity12 , shortly after their father died			1
i was walking home from the library carrying nine books			2
that 's the way my memory sees it			1
i ca n't know for sure if it was exactly nine books			2
maybe i picture nine books because i was nine years old			1
i 'm certain that i was nine years old , because i 'm sure of the date -- june 9 , 1943			1
there were a lot of books under my arm on that summer day because i loved books			1
i wonder what happened to those nine books ... there were three squad cars in front of my apartment building			2
@entity35 , we called them			2
i do n't remember exactly when i started to hear my mother 's screams			0
but as i hurried up the steps , a cop quickly came down , straight for me			0
he picked me up and the books went flying			0
watch @entity5 on his " remarkable journey " » i 'm not sure if i knew the cop			1
for years , before the war started and my father went to work in the defense plant , he 'd owned a little neighborhood bar and grill			1
he was friendly with all the cops			0
the cops loved my father the way they loved any bar owner who had a great sense of humor			1
i remember having my own police costume when i was very young			1
a badge and a little nightstick came with it			0
i 'd make like i was walking the beat			0
the cop put me in the squad car			0
he told me that my father had died			1
i was more befuddled than anything else			0
it must have been difficult for the cop			0
he started the car and drove			0
we wound through the streets of @entity74 and ended up at a movie theater			1
i 'll never forget the movie , @entity77 , starring @entity78 as sergeant @entity79			1
it was about a bunch of @entity83 soldiers trying to stave off the @entity85 invasion of the @entity86			0
@entity5 's life in pictures » sergeant @entity79 and his patrol are ordered to blow up a bridge to stop the advancing enemy			1
they 're cut down one by one until only @entity94 and two others remain			0
the first is killed by a sniper			0
the second is stabbed by a @entity85 soldier who 'd been playing dead			0
the movie ends with sergeant @entity79 firing his machine gun straight into the camera at the @entity85 soldiers coming at him in one last act of courage and defiance			1
i do n't remember what it was like when i got home that day			2
a lot about that day i 've blocked out			1
my younger brother @entity12 has blocked it out , too			2
he was only six at the time			0
but there are a few more memories attached			0
i did n't go to the funeral			2
i 'd been so close to my father -- yet i refused to go			1
there must 've been somebody watching me , but i remember being alone			0
i remember bouncing a spaldeen -- the @entity122 rubber ball we used to play stickball -- off the front stoop			0
two other things i can tell you for sure			0
i never went back to that library again , and from that day on i was nervous if i saw a squad car in my neighborhood			2
if one parked by my apartment building , i 'd start running home , in fear that my mother had died .			2

@entity5 was 9 years old when his father died of a heart attack in 1943
@entity5 says he has blocked much of that day from his memory
he recalls a police officer broke the news , then took him to see a movie
@entity5 refused to attend funeral though he and his father were *extremely* close
