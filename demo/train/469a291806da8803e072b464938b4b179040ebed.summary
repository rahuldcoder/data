nowadays , it 's more useful to mine your past -- or someone else 's			1
so we are awash in memoirs and biographies			1
in 2007 , more memoirs were accepted by publishers than debut novels , reported an industry newsletter			1
the trend has shown no signs of abating			2
how can you separate the promising from the pulp ? @entity22 has come to the rescue			1
the mammoth online store , which remains a dominant bookseller , just issued a list of " @entity27 to read in a @entity28			1
" readers can chime in with their own choices via @entity31 , an @entity22 affiliate			1
the list is the latest of @entity22 's list compilations			1
( last year the company did a general fiction / nonfiction list of " 100 books to read in a @entity28			1
" ) " a lot of people were saying , ' i love to read biographies ' and it was going to be @entity41 , and we thought of all the presidential biographies , so we said let 's do biographies , " said @entity37 , @entity22 's editorial director			1
the @entity22 staff compiled a list of about 200 books and winnowed it down to the final 100			1
among their choices : @entity52 's " @entity53 , " @entity54 's " @entity51 , " @entity55 's " night , " " the @entity56 " and @entity58 's " @entity57			2
" naturally , the staff here at @entity1 had some worthy books that did n't make @entity22 's list			1
here are 10 more suggestions , in alphabetical order by author : " @entity65 , " @entity66 the writing of @entity69 's slim 1997 memoir is a story in itself			1
the author , a @entity72 magazine editor , suffered a stroke that left him with " locked - in syndrome " -- physically paralyzed but mentally present			2
he wrote the book by blinking his left eyelid			2
in it , he recalls the events of his life and demonstrates that even though the body is immobilized the mind can still wander freely			2
@entity66 's book was made into a 2007 movie			2
" all over but the @entity85 ' , " @entity86 @entity86 , a former @entity87 reporter , describes his life growing up poor in northern @entity89 and his struggle to escape the cycle of poverty that claimed many of his neighbors			2

" the @entity101 , " @entity102 @entity22 has @entity106 's hilarious and revelatory " @entity112 " on its list , but before @entity106 's diary there was @entity102 's 1960 chronicle , detailing his pitching life in a season with the @entity110 and @entity111			1
it was " the first honest portrayal of the life of a baseball player , " wrote @entity116 for the @entity117 , and remains a crackling good read			1
" @entity119 , " @entity120 before @entity120 , who died last week at age 58 , was a well - respected media reporter for the @entity87 he was a drug addict -- the kind of irresponsible dope hound who would leave his children in a car on a freezing @entity127 night while he went to score			2
" @entity119 , " from 2008 , tells how he hit rock bottom and worked his way back up -- while willing to investigate his life with the same kind of unsentimental focus he brought to his columns			0
" the @entity135 and tragic life of @entity136 , " @entity137 @entity137 ' book , released late last year , describes the life of @entity136 , an @entity140 from @entity141 , @entity142 , who became a standout student at @entity144 , came back to his hometown to teach and then was shot to death at age 30			0
@entity137 , his college roommate , is determined to show that " @entity149 was not a cliche , " as he told @entity151			0
the book has received outstanding reviews			0
" how to be a woman , " @entity154 @entity156 , a columnist for the @entity157 , published this half - memoir , half - manifesto in 2011			0
she 's a staunch feminist and bluntly casts a wide net : " do you have a vagina ? do you want to be in charge of it ? " she asks			0

" the joy of this book is just that : the joy , " wrote @entity170 in @entity171			0
" @entity175 : @entity176 , " @entity177 there are plenty of terrific @entity181 biographies -- just a couple years ago , @entity182 published " @entity183 , " the first volume of his projected three - volume work on the @entity186 -- but few good ones about the band members as individuals			0
@entity177 , who wrote the @entity181 bio " @entity190 ! " in 1981 , published his 800 - page biography of @entity175 in 2008 and managed to capture a well - rounded portrait of a complex man			0
" twelve years a slave , " @entity194 the basis for the @entity198 - winning best picture still packs a wallop more than 150 years after it was first published			0
@entity200 , a free man living in @entity202 , was kidnapped on a trip to @entity204 , sold into slavery and spent the next 12 years at a @entity207 plantation			0

" @entity233 : the @entity234 , " @entity235 and then there 's @entity233 , whose detailed diary of 17th - century @entity240 life has become a model for both detail ( want to know how surgery was conducted in the 1650s ? really ? ) and candor			0
