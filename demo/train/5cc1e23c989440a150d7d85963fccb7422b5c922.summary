@entity0 -- in a rare public spat , @entity3 president @entity2 criticized his political mentor , prime minister @entity5 , for @entity5 's comments over the use of force against @entity9			1
it all started monday , when @entity5 visited the town of @entity12 , where a large defense plant that produces missiles ( including nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles ) is located			2
criticizing the @entity17 resolution authorizing a no - fly zone over @entity9 and military action to back it up , @entity5 called it " obviously incomplete and flawed			1
" @entity5 said it 's clear that " it allows anyone to do anything they want -- to take any actions against a sovereign state			2
" " it resembles a medieval appeal for a crusade in which somebody calls upon somebody to go to a certain place and liberate it , " he said			1
on thursday , acting on instructions from @entity2 , @entity3 abstained from the @entity17 resolution imposing a no - fly zone over @entity9 but did not veto it , something that @entity5 obviously thought should have happened			1
a few hours later @entity2 weighed in , scolding @entity5 's comments , without using the prime minister 's name			1
" it is absolutely inexcusable to use expressions that , in effect , lead to a clash of civilizations -- such as ' crusades , ' and so on			2
that is unacceptable , " he said			1
otherwise " everything could end up in far worse shape than it is now			2
it is important to remember this			0
" @entity2 went on : " all that is now happening in @entity9 is the result of the appalling behavior of the @entity9 leadership and the crimes it committed against its own people			0
" he did not instruct his diplomats to veto the resolution , he said , " for one reason : i do not consider this resolution to be wrong			1
moreover , i believe that this resolution generally reflects our understanding of what is going on in @entity9			1
" the public smackdown was political catnip in @entity71			0
the two men , whom @entity3 refer to as " the tandem , " both could be candidates for president in 2012 but neither is announcing yet he will run			1
speculation is rife over who might go first -- and when			0
@entity2 has developed a close working relationship with president @entity79 but @entity5 has a prickly relationship with @entity81			2
at the factory monday , @entity5 took aim not only at @entity2 's refusal to use his veto , but at the @entity87 leadership : " in @entity89 's times , " @entity5 said , " @entity90 and @entity91 were bombed			0
@entity92 sent armed forces into @entity94			0
a far - fetched and totally false pretext was used to invade @entity99 , and the entire @entity99 leadership was eliminated , even children in @entity97 's family died			0
" and now , it 's @entity9 's turn -- under the pretext of protecting civilians			0
but it 's the civilian population who dies during those airstrikes against ( @entity9 ) territory			0
where is the logic and the conscience ? there is neither			0

prime minister raps @entity17 resolution , refers to " crusade "
