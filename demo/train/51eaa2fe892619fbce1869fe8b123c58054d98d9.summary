-- @entity1 celebrates its bicentennial wednesday , an event known as " @entity3 , " the shout for independence first credited to a catholic priest who demanded freedom from @entity8			1
for many @entity1 today , though , it 's a quiet shout of despair			1
the country is mired in a bloody drug war that has seen more than 28,000 people killed in less than four years			1
the economy has barely begun to rebound from the global downturn , which hit @entity1 harder than most @entity17 countries			1
tourism , a major lifeblood for the nation , is drastically down because of the violence and a flu pandemic last year that began in @entity1			1
and oil revenues , long a rich sustenance for the nation 's economy , also have suffered a major collapse			1
despite government efforts to hold a vast celebration that one leading newspaper called part @entity31 and part infomercial , many @entity1 are just not feeling it			1
" the climate in which we 're living in this country does not lend itself to a real celebration , " said @entity35 , who owns a car rental company and chauffeur service in @entity38 , the capital of southeastern @entity1 's @entity40 state			1
@entity45 sounds leery of the nearly $ 232 million ( about 2.97 billion pesos ) the government says it has spent on celebrations in @entity48			1
the lavish events wednesday night will feature a parade , fireworks and a show that has merited visits by five @entity17 presidents and dignitaries from 50 nations			1
" they are grabbing it as an effort to make us forget everything that is happening in the country , " @entity45 said			0
" it 's more of a distraction			0
" that distraction does not seem to be working			0
" @entity1 is downbeat , " said @entity66 , president emeritus of the @entity67 , a non-partisan policy institute in @entity68			1
" people are nervous about the future			2
" @entity71 , director of the @entity73 's @entity72 , sees @entity1 at a crossroads			1
" it 's a time of soul - searching , " he said wednesday			2
it 's also a time of anxiety for authorities , who want to make sure the festivities go off without any major incidents or violence from the nation 's organized crime groups			0
a bombing at a @entity88 celebration two years ago in @entity90 state left eight dead and more than 100 wounded			0
more recently , narcotrafficking cartels have taken to setting off car bombs , an unprecedented event in the nation 's drug wars			2
authorities have dispatched more than 14,000 police and troops to the streets of @entity48 to guard the peace			0
more than 2 million people are expected to throng the streets of the central city to watch the parade			0
@entity1 formally recognizes its independence day each september 16 -- thursday -- but the major celebration traditionally begins the night before			1
close to midnight , president @entity107 will make the symbolic shout " @entity109 " in the city 's @entity110 , better known as the @entity110			0
it is one of the largest plazas in the world			0
the shout pays tribute to a priest who called for sparked @entity1 's struggle for independence from @entity8 on sept. 16 , 1810			1
other cities have canceled celebrations			2
@entity123 , the most violent city in the country , is one of them			0
celebrations also were canceled in @entity40 state			2
that 's probably a good thing , @entity45 said			0
" you ca n't openly go out and celebrate , " he said			0
besides the security concerns , there 's another reason @entity45 does not feel like celebrating -- the economy			2
rain and recent storms have washed over much of @entity38 , damaging the tourist trade upon which the father of two young boys relies for his chauffeur and car rental business			0
" the little that i make goes to pay bills , " he said			0
gone this year , he said , is the usual trip over the holiday to visit his wife 's parents in nearby @entity150			2
" we 're going to have to do it in a more simple way , " he said			0
despite the problems and the worries , @entity71 says @entity1 will rally around the flag this week			1
" by tonight , people will celebrate , " he said wednesday morning			0
" when people around the country shout , ' @entity109 , ' they will come together with pride about @entity1			1
" but how long will that last ? " people will put aside their differences for 24 to 48 hours , " @entity71 said			0
some might say it 's not much of a reprieve for a country celebrating 200 years since it first tried to gain independence .			2

the 200 - year *anniversary* comes amid drug - war deaths and a *slumping* economy
some residents see lavish celebrations as an attempt to try to distract the *population*
*analysts* see @entity1 as " downbeat " and " nervous "
