-- the @entity1 has admitted that it targeted groups with " tea party " or " patriot " in their names			1
we 've since learned that a wider array of groups concerned about spending , debt , high taxes , government growth , the @entity14 , the @entity15 -- basically any conservative or libertarian issue you can name -- was targeted			2
president @entity18 said monday that he was " outraged " over the @entity1 ' behavior			1
he said that those responsible should be held " fully accountable			0
" i wonder when that will happen ? on wednesday , the president requested and received the resignation of acting irs commissioner @entity25 -- but that is not enough			1
the executive branch has been aware of this scandal for nearly two years and now , only as a result of massive public pressure , the administration has found a scapegoat			2
the president did not announce that @entity25 was responsible , and we still do n't know who came up with the idea to target the tea party			2
we have not been told whether @entity18 administration officials knew about the discrimination and if they allowed it to continue when they found out			0
forcing out @entity25 is not the end of this scandal			1
holding the guilty parties accountable is just the first step			0
but if the handling of the attack in @entity47 , @entity48 , is any indication , there are no guarantees this will happen			0
the @entity1 is under the president 's jurisdiction			1
he needs to fully recognize the gravity of these charges			0
the @entity1 targeting citizens for political reasons is not simply another @entity60 scandal			1
at issue is something that strikes at the very heart of who we are as a people , what we believe as @entity68 and what this country has always stood for			1
the @entity71 was written to protect many different types of expression			0
but the @entity75 ' primary concern -- and a first principle for every generation of @entity68 that followed -- was the protection of political speech			1
apparently , the @entity1 was even targeting people who criticized how the country was being run			1
protecting citizens ' right to speak out against their government has always been an integral part of what separates us from tyrannical regimes			2
what the @entity1 did is how the @entity90 used to target dissidents			1
it is how they deal with troublemakers in @entity95			0
it is not how we treat @entity68 citizens			1
this week , i introduced a @entity101 condemning the @entity1 ' actions and calling for a full investigation into how the agency infringed upon the @entity71 rights of those targeted			1
@entity107 put a hold on my resolution			1
we have learned that some officials knew about these indiscretions long before the recent denials			0
we wanted to investigate to find out who knew what , when , and for how long			0
we have learned that some tea party groups had unduly long wait times for tax - exempt status			0
some eventually withdrew their applications out of frustration			0
in my home state of @entity124 , a 9/12 group filed for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) status in december of 2010			0
it received its first correspondence almost immediately , saying there would be a determination within 90 days			0
fourteen months later , the @entity1 requested answers to 30 questions with sub-bullets -- 88 total separate inquiries -- and gave only a two - week period to comply			1
the @entity135 's @entity134 estimated that it would have taken 5,000 pages to respond			2
eventually , the @entity1 granted granted this group tax - exempt status -- after well over a year			2
we wanted to find out why they had to wait			0
we wanted to find out what groups , and how many , might have been victims of political discrimination			0
we wanted to ask for an independent authority to investigate and seek criminal charges against those who were involved in targeting @entity68 for their political views			1
we wanted to determine if the @entity148 was aware and failed to take action			0
this is not about @entity151 vs. @entity152 or conservative vs. liberal			1
it is about arrogant and unrestrained government vs. the rule of law			1
imagine if the @entity1 had targeted liberal or progressive groups under the @entity159 administration			2
the @entity71 can not be renegotiated depending on which party holds power			0
the power to tax is the power to destroy			0
these allegations concerning the @entity1 remind us yet again of the inherently destructive nature of leviathan			2
with @entity170 adding staff and hundreds of millions to the budget of the @entity1 , the new and intrusive powers granted to our nation 's revenue collection service were worrisome enough			1
we should use this recent abuse of power as an opportunity to rein them in			0
each congressman and senator , and even the president , took an oath to uphold and defend the @entity14			0
it is now upon us to determine if the @entity1 intentionally trampled the @entity71 rights of @entity68 who dared to dissent			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 : forcing out acting @entity1 commissioner is n't a *sufficient* remedy to scandal
by political targeting , @entity1 *endangered* the heart of @entity68 *democracy* , he says
@entity186 : it 's not about @entity151 vs. @entity107 but unrestrained government vs. *individual* rights
