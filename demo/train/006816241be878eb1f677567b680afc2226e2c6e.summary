-- the showdown between the @entity2 and @entity4 's largest group of @entity6 nuns is expected to peak this week when group leaders will meet to determine a response to the @entity2 's reprimand for the group 's " radical feminist themes			1
" the church also demands major reforms from the nuns ' group			1
the @entity21 , initially surprised by the @entity2 's report last month , " plans to move slowly , not rushing to judgment " when the group 's 21 - member board meets for three days in @entity20 , beginning tuesday			1
" the board will conduct its meeting in an atmosphere of prayer , contemplation and dialogue and will develop a plan to involve @entity21 membership in similar processes , " the group said in a statement			2
" we will engage in dialogue where possible and be open to the movement of the @entity37			0
we ask your prayer for us and for the church in this critical time			0
" last month , the @entity42 , the @entity12 's doctrinal watchdog , did a years - long " doctrinal assessment " investigation of the group -- which represents 80 % of the @entity6 nuns in @entity4 -- and found " serious doctrinal problems			1
" the @entity2 accused the @entity21 of sponsoring " certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the catholic faith in some of the programs and presentations			1
" the @entity2 report , made public by the @entity54 , said the doctrinal assessment began in part because of the group 's dissent on the @entity2 's teaching on the ordination of women and human sexuality			1
the @entity12 ordains only men to be priests and says sex is to be between a man and woman who are married in the eyes of the church			0
while the assessment praised the social justice work of the group and other organizations such as @entity75 and the @entity76 , it said the groups were " silent on the right to life from conception to natural death , a question that is part of the lively public debate about abortion and euthanasia in the @entity4			1
" @entity86 , a nun who 's executive director of @entity75 , a national @entity6 social justice lobby in @entity20 , said her " hunch " is that the @entity21 will put together an outline response this week to be presented to the group 's full assembly during its august meeting			1
" i think the results for the media will be very anticlimactic because we as catholic sisters do things with a lot of prayer and very slowly , " @entity86 about this week 's meeting			1
" it 's going to be like watching paint dry , " she added in a @entity0 interview			2
the @entity42 appointed archbishop @entity103 of @entity104 to institute the reforms			2
the @entity54 is providing support to @entity107 , and the @entity21 is n't expected to publicly address the @entity2 report until after this week 's meeting , said @entity110 , spokeswoman for the bishops ' conference			1
nuns in various orders around the @entity4 have been conversing about the @entity2 report , and their reactions have been " surprised , stunned , shocked , " @entity86 said			1
she said the report left her feeling " as being suspect			2
" " for myself , the shock made me numb at first , and then i was profoundly sad that my life as a woman religious and my commitment to serving the poor would be so denigrated by the leadership of our church , " @entity86 said			0
" all we do is work for love			0
" for the report to say " you do n't do everything , " @entity86 said , is " ridiculous			2
" " they 're saying we 're silent on some issues			0
it 's not our issue			2
other people do those works , " @entity86 said			0
the report took note of public statements from the nuns that opposed the @entity144			1
the @entity21 and @entity75 vocally disagreed with the @entity147 ' conference 's position on the @entity148 , which they supported and the @entity147 did not			2
the @entity42 called the current doctrinal and pastoral positions of the groups " grave and a matter of serious concern , " because of the global influence of the groups			0
some observers of the church say the @entity21 may take a low - key position in its response and seek to defuse a confrontation			0
others such as @entity0 's senior @entity2 analyst @entity162 said the @entity2 report has basically decreed that the @entity21 " needs an overhaul in which it will have a tighter relationship with the bishops			1
" " basically , it needs to be more obedient , " said @entity162 , who 's also a senior correspondent for the @entity168 , based in @entity169 , @entity170			2
the @entity4 nuns ' group could do one of three options this week : it could go along with everything the @entity2 is saying ; it could offer to work and negotiate with the @entity2 but say " let 's talk " ; or it could say " we 're not going to play ball and we 're going to walk away , " @entity162 said			1
the last option would essentially mean " we 'll disband the @entity21 and let it die on the vine and go off and do our own thing , " @entity162 said			0
" that 's what on the table here : how do the nuns want to respond to the crackdown that they received from the @entity2 , " @entity162 added			1
he also noted how many of the group leaders are in their 60s and 70s			2
" some of them do n't want to spend the last 10 years of their life engaged in negotiations with the @entity2 , " @entity162 said			2
" some of them just do n't want to deal with this			0
this will be the first opportunity where we 'll be able to take the temperature of the group on where the nuns stand on this			1
" one way or another , it 's an important crossroads moment , " he added			1
for @entity86 , the @entity2 report does n't pose a crisis of conscience			1
" it 's not affecting my conscience			0
it affects my sadness and heart			0
this life is profound and deep , " @entity86 said			0
" when politics interferes , it does n't change the depth of the spiritual			0
it 's not an issue of conscience			0
" @entity86 belongs to the @entity222 , an order based in @entity224 , @entity225 , and the community is meeting for the feast of the @entity228 from sunday to tuesday			0
the congregation might put together a position statement for the @entity21 's assembly meeting in august , @entity86 said			0
" we 're open to the @entity37 and to let the group wisdom lead us , so i have no idea " on whether on a position will be taken by the order , @entity86 said			0
