the announcement came after leaders of the church in @entity11 said @entity23 priests who abused children should tell their superiors			1
" we want to repeat this call with force , " said bishop @entity26 , the bishop of @entity27			2

" there were three men at the table , and he was just telling that he did n't remember any more , and it was n't so bad , and i had to feel pity because he was old , " she said			0
" it seems to me that the victims are the abusers and the abusers are the victims when you hear them speaking about ' just forgive us and continue your life			2
' " the abuse , she said , has had an impact on her faith			2
" i try to separate my faith and the church , but it 's very hard , " she said			2
" perhaps there is a @entity140 , but then he has nothing to do with all the men there			0
no. the church is finished			1
