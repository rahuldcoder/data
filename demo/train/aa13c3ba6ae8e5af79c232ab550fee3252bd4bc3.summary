-- growing up near the @entity1 of @entity2 , a good portion of my youth was spent on the fields or on the courts			0
whether it was baseball in the summer or basketball in the winter , being an athlete pretty much defined my existence			0
sports were the no. 1 thing i cared about			1
( it did n't hurt that @entity17 and the @entity18 were in pursuit of their six @entity21 championships at the time			0
) needless to say , staying in shape and getting enough exercise were not problems i had to deal with			0
in high school , my participation in sports meant more training			1
practices and workouts were exhaustive and took up a good portion of my afternoons and evenings			1
playing sports helped me develop friendships , hone my skills and stay in great shape			1
once again , getting enough exercise was not a problem			0
then i hit the ripe old age of 22			0
get fit and others will follow after high school , my fitness levels began to decline			1
besides my poor eating habits , i attribute this to one factor : i 'd been benched			0
my access to team sports was dwindling , and there was an extreme unlikelihood that the @entity50 and @entity21 would be knocking on my door any time soon			1
daily practices and games were replaced by long work hours , dinner out with friends and nights in front of the tv			1
i joined weekend sports leagues where beer , not winning , was the primary goal			1
( not that i complained			0
) staying in shape and getting enough exercise were now big problems			0
t - shirt tales : the athlete i used to be i was not prepared to enter the world of individual sports in order to stay active			1
i found going on a " long " run or swimming laps in the pool to be quite boring			1
where were my teammates ? where were the screaming coaches ? throughout my life , the concept of " team " had been stressed on a daily basis , and now it was nowhere to be found			2
i realized that i needed to find a team			2
i needed to be a part of something bigger than myself			0
believe it or not , my biggest reason for applying to the @entity87 was not the free bike or the cool gear			0
rather , i loved the idea that we would be competing in the triathlon in @entity94 as a team : six people , from all parts of the country , coming together for one goal			2
the journey thus far would not have been possible without my @entity102 teammates and coaches			1
i rely on them daily for their motivation , their expertise and their unwavering support			0
getting fit for the family i love being a part of a team has always played a large role in my success as an athlete , on and off the field			1
the camaraderie and accountability present within a team setting are things i have been unable to replicate when going at it alone			2
my sudden cardiac arrest in october 2011 created a daily reminder of my health and my need for exercise , but my selection to the @entity87 team pushed me to think deeper about where i am right now , where i 've been and where i hope to go			2
my team is the reason i 'll complete my workout this afternoon , and my team is the reason i will cross the finish line in september			2
follow @entity137 's journey on @entity138 @ @entity139			0

participating in team sports helped @entity142 stay fit as a teen
after high school , practices were replaced by long work hours , dinner out
now @entity142 hopes the @entity102 will *inspire* him to push his fitness limits
