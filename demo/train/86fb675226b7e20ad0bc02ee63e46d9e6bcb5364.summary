-- the discovery of a blond - haired , blue - eyed young girl in a @entity4 camp in @entity5 last week immediately caught the attention of several families in the @entity8			1
could this disheveled girl with mysterious origins , known as @entity11 , be one of @entity8 's missing ? could she even be " @entity13 , the girl who disappeared two years ago from her @entity15 home ? though the apparent age difference makes this a stretch -- @entity19 , though not a baby anymore , would only be about 3 now , and @entity11 is estimated to be about 5 or 6 -- the mystery of the girl 's identity seems to have provided a tantalizing bit of hope to the @entity26 family , and to other families who hold vigil for their missing children			1
the @entity30 says it has gotten thousands of calls from people claiming to have clues as to who @entity11 is and where she belongs			1
the @entity5 children 's rights group @entity36 says it is looking into about 10 missing children cases in connection with @entity11 , and several of the cases are in the @entity8			1
that 's 10 families whose hope will be reignited , and 10 families whose pain may be made fresh once again if the lead does n't pan out			1
few know the fleeting moments of hope -- and anguish -- associated with the search for a missing child like @entity51 , the father of @entity51 , the @entity54 teen who went missing on a trip to @entity56 in 2005			1
the @entity60 case captivated the country , and even now from time to time , a new lead in the case will make headlines			1
' a never - ending story ' in an interview with @entity0 , @entity60 said he is currently interested in one such lead			1
there is a @entity68 man in @entity56 , he said , who claims to know where @entity70 's body was hidden			1
@entity60 is a bit skeptical , but if the information seems promising , he 'll follow through			2
this is the life of a parent who has seen every side of his child 's tragedy laid bare for the public : the panic , the hope , the feelings of resignation and the never - ending quest for answers			1
@entity60 says he does n't mind the media attention			2
if anything , he appreciates it			2
any coverage gets the family closer to finding out the truth			2
" if the media is not attacking it , the [ @entity56 ] authorities are n't interested , " he said			2
" of all of the thousands of cases involving missing children , the parents have always yearned for media attention			1
" over the years , @entity60 has worked with numerous families and support groups for parents with missing children			1
in addition to all of the grief he has felt and witnessed , another emotion surfaces , as well : guilt			2
when a child is lost , it at first seems as if the options are inexhaustible			1
as time passes , the leads become fewer , the attention dies down and @entity60 said , some parents he has met are left grasping at straws			1
" there 's a lot of guilt , " he said			2
" i ran into individuals that felt like they maybe could have done more , keep pushing and pushing , and maybe something will get done			2
" @entity51 was declared dead in 2012			1
it was her father who filed the petition			1
it was n't , he said , for emotional closure			2
" at some point in time , you 've got to take care of some legal issues			2
she was still listed as a beneficiary -- there 's insurance , savings accounts			2
" @entity51 had started a college fund for @entity70 that had to be used by the time she turned 21			1
her 21st birthday came and went in 2007 , and she was n't there to collect it			2
" time eventually takes care of the healing process , " @entity60 said			2
" but for us , it 's like a never - ending story			2
" the @entity147 are certain they know who can tell them about their daughter 's disappearance			0
unfortunately , that man is languishing in a @entity153 prison			0
@entity68 national @entity154 was a prime suspect in @entity60 's disappearance , and his ever - changing claims regarding his involvement kept the media , and the @entity147 , on a tight leash			0
he was indicted by the @entity8 for fraud and extortion in connection with the case			0
however , in 2012 , he pleaded guilty to the murder of a young woman in @entity166 , and is currently serving a 28 - year sentence			0
for the @entity147 , that means their quest for justice has been put on an excruciating , lengthy hold			0
" somebody knows the answers , and someone is withholding , " @entity60 said of @entity154			0
@entity60 said he and his family had been frustrated by the authorities in @entity56 , and now , they must abide by the @entity153 justice system as well			0
" it 's never going to end for us , as far as justice is concerned			0
" ' i feel like she 's ok ' just two weeks ago , the parents of @entity19 observed the second anniversary of their daughter 's disappearance			1
@entity187 , just an infant at the time of her disappearance , was reported by her parents as having been kidnapped during a home invasion			1
during a recent vigil in front of their @entity196 home , @entity187 's mother , @entity19 , clutched a time - lapse portrait of her daughter and said , through tears , that she still had hope that @entity187 was alive			1
" my mother 's intuition ... is that , i feel like she 's ok , " @entity201 said			0
@entity201 and @entity187 's father , @entity19 , still keep @entity187 's bedroom intact , as if she will come home at any minute			1
it is filled with outfits and gifts the couple has bought their child for milestones she has not been present to observe			0
when @entity201 speaks of her daughter , it is in the present tense			0
when news of the @entity4 girl @entity11 began to surface , the @entity26 family reached out to the @entity30 , and despite the doubts as to the connection between the cases , is working with the agency to determine whether the girl is their lost daughter			1
and even if she is n't , the family 's faith seemingly remains stalwart			0
" i have no doubt " that she is going to come home , @entity201 said			0
' it consumes you ' @entity51 does n't wait by the phone anymore , hoping for news of his daughter 's safe return			1
too much has happened , too much time has passed			0
at some point , he said , you have to set your highest hopes aside			0
" in the beginning , it all consumes you			0
everything in your life takes second place , goes on the back burner , " he said			0
" it consumes you , but you ca n't let it after a time			0
there are other things in life , family members			0
we lost so much time with our other children searching for @entity70			1
" he likened it to losing sight of a young child ; that instinctual , paralyzing moment of fear			0
except the moment does n't stop			0
and you ca n't stay paralyzed forever			0
" you exhaust all your leads , and finally , you 're at the point where there 's nothing else to do , " he said			0
" i feel for those families who are totally clueless			1
at least we know who is responsible for our daughter 's disappearance			0
" ' we are not alone ' for the families of missing children , there is always a hope , no matter how small			1
for the @entity26 family , their hope is kept alive by newfound worldwide attention			1
in an interview with @entity284 's dr. @entity283 , @entity19 said she has received an outpouring of support from friends and strangers around the world			0
" it has really shown us that we are not alone in our search for @entity187 , " she said in the interview			0
" we 're in awe at the amount of compassion and care , and the fact that there are so many people that are looking for her right along with us			0

discovery of ' @entity11 ' has reignited hope for families of missing children
@entity0 talks to the father of @entity51 , who went missing in 2005
parents of lost children often tread a line between hope and realism
