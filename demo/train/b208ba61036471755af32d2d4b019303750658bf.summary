-- @entity1 , a mother of two , is waiting to die in @entity2 by a method of execution described by her lawyer as " barbaric " -- stoning			1
she will be buried up to her chest , deeper than a man would be , and the stones that will be hurled at her will be large enough to cause pain but not so large as to kill her immediately , according to an @entity11 report that cited the @entity2 penal code			2
the 42 - year - old woman from the northern city of @entity15 was convicted of adultery in 2006 , and her execution is imminent , said prominent human rights lawyer @entity18			1
@entity1 was forced to confess after being subjected to 99 lashes , @entity18 said thursday in a telephone interview from @entity21			1
she later retracted that confession and has denied wrongdoing			2
her conviction was based not on evidence but on the determination of three out of five judges , @entity18 said			2
she has asked forgiveness from the court but the judges refused to grant clemency			2
@entity2 's supreme court upheld the conviction in 2007			2
@entity18 believes a language barrier prevented his client from fully comprehending court proceedings			2
@entity1 is of @entity38 descent and speaks @entity39 , not @entity40			0
the circumstances of @entity1 's case make it not an exception but the rule in @entity2 , according to @entity11 , which tracks death penalty cases around the world			1
" the majority of those sentenced to death by stoning are women , who suffer disproportionately from such punishment , " the human rights group said in a 2008 report			1
on wednesday , @entity11 made a new call to the @entity2 government to immediately halt all executions and commute all death sentences			1
the group has recorded 126 executions in @entity2 from the start of this year to june 6			0
" the organization is also urging the authorities to review and repeal death penalty laws , to disclose full details of all death sentences and executions and to join the growing international trend towards abolition , " the statement said			1
in @entity73 , the @entity72 criticized the scheduled stoning , saying it raised serious concerns about human rights violations by the @entity2 government			1
" we have grave concerns that the punishment does not fit the alleged crime , " assistant secretary of state @entity77 said thursday			1
" for a modern society such as @entity2 , we think this raises significant human rights concerns			1
" calling @entity2 's judicial system " disproportionate " in its treatment of women , @entity77 said , " from the @entity89 ' standpoint , we do n't think putting women to death for adultery is an appropriate punishment			1
" human rights activists have been pushing the @entity96 government to abolish stoning , arguing that women are not treated equally before the law in @entity2 and are especially vulnerable in the judicial system			0
a woman 's testimony is worth half that of a man			0
article 74 of the @entity2 penal code requires at least four witnesses -- four men or three men and two women -- for an adulterer to receive a stoning sentence , said @entity111 , coordinator for the @entity112			0
but there were no witnesses in @entity1 's case			0
often , said @entity111 , husbands turn wives in to get out of a marriage			0
@entity18 said he could not understand how such a savage method of death could exist in the year 2010 or how an innocent woman could be taken from her son and daughter , who have written to the court pleading for their mother 's life			1
the public wo n't be allowed to witness the stoning , @entity18 said , for fear of condemnation of such a brutal method			2
he is hoping there wo n't be an execution			0
@entity18 , who himself did jail time in the aftermath of the disputed presidential elections in june 2009 , said he realizes the risk of speaking out for @entity1 , for fighting for human rights			0
but he does n't let that deter him			0
he last saw @entity1 five months ago behind bars in @entity15			0
since then , he said , he has been searching for a way to save her from the stones			0
@entity0 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
