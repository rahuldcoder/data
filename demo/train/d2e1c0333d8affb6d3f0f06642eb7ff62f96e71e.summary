-- for those of you dreaming of visiting @entity4 , readings taken during the @entity3 's voyage to the @entity4 offer a new measurement to ponder as you weigh the risks			1
@entity4 - bound pioneers will be exposed to radiation levels that could effectively retire astronauts under @entity14 's current standards , scientists reported thursday			1
the radiation astronauts would face on a round trip would be comparable to getting an abdominal ct scan " about once every five days , " said @entity18 , principal scientist for the @entity14 - led @entity19			1
the findings were published thursday in the journal @entity22 , based on data from a device called the @entity25 that took readings during @entity3 's trip to @entity4			1
the spacecraft was similar to one that would carry humans , and scientists were interested in measuring galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the trip			2
" it is clear that the exposure from the cruise phases alone is a large fraction of ( and in some cases greater than ) currently accepted astronaut career limits , " they wrote			2
@entity18 and his colleagues found voyagers could be exposed to between 554 and 770 millisieverts of ionizing radiation during the trip , depending on the level of solar activity			1
by comparison , the typical @entity47 receives about 6.2 millisieverts a year from natural and man - made sources , including medical diagnostic procedures			0
" the radiation environment in deep space is several hundred times what it is on @entity55 , and that 's even inside a shielded spacecraft , " @entity18 said			1
@entity14 standards limit the amount of radiation exposure for astronauts to levels that would produce no more than a 3 % increase in lifetime of fatal cancers -- a level that varies with age and gender			1
the dose estimate was based on a one - way trip time of 180 days			2
that 's about the fastest that current rocket engines can propel a spacecraft , and it 's far shorter than the 253 days @entity3 took to get to @entity4 in 2012			1
501 days in space with your spouse : could you handle it ? most of the exposure estimated in thursday 's paper would come from galactic cosmic rays			2
they 're composed of high - energy , highly penetrating particles , and astronauts would be exposed to them chronically			0
shielding that would completely block those rays would be " meters thick " and too heavy to be used aboard a spacecraft , said @entity90 , a radiation health expert at @entity14 's @entity92			1
@entity93 , @entity14 's deputy director for advanced exploration systems , said the space agency is working on engines aimed at cutting the trip time by the 2030s , when it hopes to send humans to @entity4			1
but it will take " many years " before those systems are ready , he said			0
in the meantime , @entity93 said engineers could try to limit travelers ' exposures by designing a spacecraft in such a way that it provides more protection			0
" ideally , we 'd like to arrange the configuration of the habitat to provide radiation protection by surrounding the crew with water , which contains a lot of hydrogen , " he told reporters thursday afternoon			0
" that 's the most effective shielding that we know of			2
" a one - way ticket to @entity4 astronauts would also be bombarded with solar energetic particles , which get accelerated close to the sun as a result of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that shoot portions of the sun into space			1
@entity93 said @entity14 is already developing personalized shelters that would protect astronauts from a solar storm and hopes to test them " in the next few years			1
" another possibility would be to figure out how to generate a magnetic field around the spacecraft that mimics the one that protects @entity55 from the worst cosmic radiation			0
" it would require a lot of power for electromagnets , but it does have promise , so we 're donig some really advanced studies on that			0
" a question of physics , a question of biology the problem has two sides : physics and biology , @entity18 told @entity0			0
on the physics side , the radiation is in line with expectations			0
" as it stands , what we measured is pretty much in line with predictions that people have made based on various models that they put together based on what the deep space radiation environment would be , " he said			0
solar energetic particle events only contributed about 5 % to the overall measured dose equivalent during the laboratory 's cruise to @entity4			1
but these events are highly variable in terms of frequency and intensity , the study said , and the current cycle seems to be producing a weak solar maximum			0
" the @entity181 contribution could conceivably be many times larger in a different time frame , " the report said			0
and the figures out thursday only cover the trip to and from the @entity4			1
anyone who spends time on @entity4 could be exposed to more radiation , depending on how long they stay and what the shielding conditions are like			1
the health question moon missions exposed astronauts to a similar rate of radiation accumulation , but the trip was far shorter			1
the @entity198 moon mission , for instance , launched on july 16 , 1969 , landing the first humans on the moon before returning to @entity55 on july 24 , 1969			0
according to a 2010 @entity14 report on space radiation cancer risk projections [ @entity204 ] , the average @entity47 male who is 35 can safely spend between 140 and 186 days in deep space , assuming heavy shielding , and stay below that 3 % increase in cancer risk ; a 35 - year - old female could spend between 88 and 120 days			1
for those who have never smoked , however , it 's estimated that a 35 - year - old man could spend between 180 and 239 days in deep space , and a 35 - year - old female could spend between 130 and 173 days			2
the number of safe days in space increases as men and women age			0
@entity18 said his team just makes measurements ; they do n't decide what radiation dose is acceptable			0
when can we go ? interest in going to @entity4 has been mounting			2
the private company @entity224 has started its recruitment process for a one - way trip for four people to land in 2023			0
the company received 78,000 applications as of early may			0
even sooner , the @entity230 wants to send two people -- a man and a woman -- on a 501 - day roundtrip journey to @entity4 and back in 2018 , without ever actually touching down			2
the organization was founded by @entity236 , the millionaire who became the first space tourist in 2001 , and @entity93 said @entity14 would share the data from @entity3 with the group			1
@entity241 , the second man to land on the moon , wrote on @entity0 that the @entity47 " should commit itself , within two decades , to commencing @entity47 permanence on the planet @entity4			2
" @entity241 : get to @entity4 within 20 years in the meantime , the 2 - ton rover curiosity -- a $ 2.5 billion mission -- has been using its sophisticated tool kit to uncover evidence that @entity4 was once habitable			2
thanks to the rover 's efforts , scientists have determined that , yes , conditions that could have supported life once existed there			0
more space and science news from @entity0 @entity260 @entity0 's @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

new : faster engines , better shielding under study , @entity14 official says
a @entity4 trip would be like getting abdominal ct scan every five days , study finds
radiation clocked on @entity3 's trip to @entity4 approaches @entity14 's career limit for astronauts
