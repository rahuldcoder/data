the smallest boat moored at the @entity1 in @entity2 may hold the most intrigue			1
hunkered down inside a blue , 25 - foot sailboat named @entity5 are @entity6 and his wife , @entity7 , and their two boys , 2 - year - old @entity10 and 4 - year - old @entity11			1
@entity12 is no ordinary visit to the historic port , where they have eluded capture but where @entity17 found them tuesday			2
the @entity19 have been on the lam after they allegedly snatched the two boys from their grandmother 's home in @entity24			0
the couple lost custody of their children last year			0
there is an international manhunt for this family , and here they are , blending in among the other boats			0
but their stop appears likely to be temporary , as @entity37 officials announced tuesday afternoon that they plan to turn the family over to @entity40 authorities			1
@entity6 glared through his sunglasses at the @entity17 reporter who found him and said nothing beyond confirming his identity			1
the two boys are ok , said a woman matching the description of his wife , and she left it at that			0
@entity6 and @entity51 are wanted by @entity40 authorities and were not in custody in @entity37			1
but that does n't mean they are n't being watched			0
@entity37 security officials wearing sidearms appeared as the @entity17 video crew was filming and ordered them to stop			1
at the security guards ' request , @entity17 stepped away from the boat , which looked just like the photo that @entity24 law enforcement officials had circulated , except more battered			1
a statement from the @entity37 foreign ministry said the boat put in to the marina , located a few miles west of @entity2 , in bad weather on sunday			1
" from the first moment , diplomatic notes were exchanged and a permanent and professional communication has been maintained between @entity72 " -- @entity37 's foreign ministry -- " and the @entity75 in @entity2 , with the goal of guaranteeing the integrity and well - being of the minors , " the statement said			1
@entity79 : @entity80 washed ashore in the worker 's paradise @entity40 government officials have told the sheriff 's office in @entity88 , @entity24 -- which includes the city of @entity90 from which the boys went missing -- that " they are receiving exceptional cooperation from the @entity37 government , " the sheriff 's office said tuesday afternoon			1
earlier in the day , @entity96 spokesman @entity95 said the @entity96 is aware of the case , though it could not provide additional information because of privacy concerns			0
" but what i do want to say , more broadly speaking , is that one of the department 's highest priorities is the welfare of @entity40 citizens overseas , and this is particularly true for children who are our most vulnerable citizens , " @entity95 said			2
some worried that recovering the children will be difficult			0
" unfortunately , these parents and these poor children , these innocent ones , will now be in a country where there are no laws , there is no redress , and that has been a refuge for fugitives and wanted criminals for many years , " rep. @entity111 , r - @entity24 , told @entity17			2
the boys had been removed from the care of the @entity24 couple last year , and on april 2 , the couple 's parental rights were terminated in @entity130 , investigators say			1
the @entity131 described @entity6 as an anti-government protester , and he was believed to be armed , according to the @entity88 sheriff 's office			2
there is no extradition treaty between @entity37 and the @entity40 , although there have been recent cases in which @entity40 sought for crimes in the @entity40 and discovered in @entity2 have been sent back by the @entity37			1
the @entity139 currently estimates there are around 70 fugitives from @entity40 justice in @entity37 , which is one of the reasons @entity37 remains on the @entity40 list of countries that support state terrorism			1
most of the @entity40 fugitives in @entity37 have been there for decades and have ties to revolutionary movements or radical groups			1
last week , the police department in @entity154 , @entity130 , issued its own statement offering background on the @entity157 and why the boys were taken from the parents last year			1
in june of 2012 , @entity154 police responded to a disturbance report at a hotel where @entity6 and @entity51 were staying with their sons , the police statement said			2
" when police arrived , both mr. and mrs. @entity51 were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers			0
they were talking about ' completing their ultimate journey ' and were traveling across the country to ' take a journey to the @entity182 ' , " the @entity154 police statement said , adding , " let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time			0
" because of the parents ' behavior and " the fact that narcotics and weapons were located inside of the hotel room , " the children were taken by child welfare officers , and @entity79 was arrested on drug charges , the statement said			1
" approximately two weeks later , @entity194 were notified that mr. @entity6 had shown up to the foster family home ... with a firearm demanding the return of his children , " the @entity154 police statement continued			2
" the foster parents called 911 , and mr. @entity6 fled without his children			2
we have heard nothing until ( wednesday )			0
" at some point over the past few months , the children were sent to live with their grandmother , @entity205 , the mother of @entity51			0

that vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home			0
those investigators told @entity17 they believe @entity6 joined up with his wife , who was waiting in their pickup truck , and the family drove to a parking garage			2
a short time later , investigators said , @entity6 is believed to have taken a sailboat out of a private slip in nearby @entity225			0
