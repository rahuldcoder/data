@entity0 -- say goodbye to one of the greatest irritants of modern life : television commercials that are much louder than the show you are watching ! beginning thursday , the @entity11 is barring broadcasters and pay tv providers from airing excessively loud commercials , saying ads must maintain the " same average volume " as the programs they accompany			1
the move -- which undoubtedly will make many tv viewers happier , and save countless marriages -- addresses a problem that , regulators say , is almost as old as television itself			1
loud commercials have been a leading source of complaints to the @entity11 since its consumer call center began reporting top complaints in 2002			2
since january 2008 , the @entity11 has received about 1,000 complaints and about 5,000 inquiries , the commission said			0
@entity34 mandated the change in the aptly named @entity36 , or @entity36 , @entity36 in 2010			1
last year , the @entity11 set a december 13 , 2012 , deadline for full compliance			0
until now , the @entity11 says it did n't regulate the " loudness " of commercials mainly because it was difficult to craft rules			0
for one thing , loudness is subjective			0
so , for years , the commission advised customers to mute their tvs or lower the volume			1
the @entity36 bill had wide bipartisan support , passing the @entity51 unanimously and the @entity52 by a voice vote			1
@entity55 supporters rep. @entity56 , @entity57 , and sen. @entity58 , @entity59 - @entity60 , and industry representatives plan an event in @entity0 on thursday to mark the full implementation of the law			0
the @entity11 says it has granted two temporary waivers to the law : one to @entity67 , a municipal cable system , because of financial hardship ; and to @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , which asked for a grant because it is relocating its facilities			0
non-commercial television stations are exempt from the act			2
political ads , however , must comply			1
the @entity11 will not monitor compliance , but instead will rely on consumer complaints to assist the commission to enforce the rule			2
complaints can be filed by using the online complaint form , @entity84 , at http://www.fcc.gov/complaints .			0

a new rule mandates that ads maintain the same volume as tv shows
it stems from the @entity36 , or @entity36 , act
political ads must comply
