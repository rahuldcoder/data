@entity0 , @entity1 -- during a visit to @entity1 11 years ago , @entity3 was horrified to see children as young as 3 years old rummaging through a trash dump for food and valuable materials			1
" i saw children collect green sausages , a bag of potato chip crumbs , a bag of noodles with cream , and recovered leftover yogurt next to a diaper , " said @entity3 , a @entity9 psychologist who was visiting @entity0 to do research			1
" the children began to gently clean the food -- wiping each little noodle , each potato and peeling the sausage skin so methodically and accurately			1
it was as if they had done this same activity many times			2
" @entity3 said there were maybe 200 children at the dump collecting things to eat and sell			1
" at that moment in time , my son was the same age as many of them , " said @entity3 , now 41			2
" so that struck me as horrific			2
" @entity3 learned that many children in @entity0 , a popular city for skiers and tourists in southern @entity1 , drop out of school and spend their lives working at the dump			1
determined to restore their dignity , @entity3 decided to stay in the country and start a nonprofit called @entity46 , which stands for @entity48 y @entity47 ( @entity49 and @entity50 )			1
the organization aims to provide children with free education and extracurricular programs so they have an alternative to working			1
today , approximately 200 boys and girls in @entity0 benefit from @entity46			1
" we carry out very personalized tracking of all the boys and girls we work with , " @entity3 said			0
" we work with the families , we work with the schools , we work with the medical or health centers in order to ... get them out of the labor situation			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity70 when she was starting , @entity3 first set out to understand what was leading the children to work in the dump			1
" i wanted to know what would lead a family to let this happen , " she said			0
" what i did was set up camp inside the garbage dump and work with the children , right alongside them			1
i picked through garbage , too			0
i also watched how they got around , everything they did			0
so the families started to develop a lot of trust in me			1
" while @entity1 has laws against child labor , the majority of working children do so for their families as unpaid laborers , according to the @entity96			1
parents do n't force their children to work , but the children join in at an early age because work activities often revolve around family networks			2
" all parents want a better life for their children than what they had , " @entity3 said			2
" however , there are times when their situation is so precarious they have no other way out but for the whole family to work and try to make ends meet			0
" @entity46 programs are open to anyone in the community , working or nonworking			1
but involving a working child can be a lengthy process			0
@entity3 and her team start by tracking a child and observing his or her work habits			0
after earning the child 's trust , which can often take between six months and a year , they set up a meeting with the child 's family			0
then they develop an integrated plan for helping the child and try to get the family to understand the importance of education			1
" when you work in situations where the context is one of such great poverty , it 's very difficult to talk to parents about the long term because usually they live in the immediate term , " @entity3 said			0
" we tell them that a child that has more years of schooling has the opportunity to get a better job and eventually ( make ) more money than ( they make ) doing subsistence work			2
" @entity46 has a team of professionals and volunteers working with the children to ensure their growth			1
the children are enrolled in school and have a tracking group to make sure they attend			1
there are afterschool workshops held at the @entity46 headquarters , where children can get help with their homework or do art projects			1
and psychologists , doctors and social workers are also available to work with the children and their families			2
family heads can also receive job training and child - rearing support			0
" the parents are happy with the project because they realize we 're concerned about the children			2
... we give them an incentive to have a better future , a different future , " @entity3 said			0
oftentimes , there are several children from the same family in the @entity46 program			1
@entity187 is a single mother of seven who used to work in the garbage dump to provide for her family			2
@entity3 's programs helped @entity192 get out of the dump and keep her children out of trouble			1
" i did n't have a salary , i did n't have a job , and we always have the need , " @entity192 said			0
" i resorted to her			0
she was the person i had the most trust in			0
... the kids are moving forward , and we 've gone a long way			2
" the group is funded by grants and donations			2
as a result of @entity46 efforts , many children have gone on to graduate from high school and attend college			1
there are others who are working stable jobs , and many young women have started families and are more sensitive to the upbringing of their children			1
" that 's very important for us , " @entity3 said			0
" i think that 's where we start to break vicious cycles stemming from negligent upbringing and upbringing with mistreatment			0
i think that 's our greatest success to date			0
" @entity3 describes her job as " full - life " rather than " full - time , " but she said she ca n't imagine it any other way			0
" the problems these boys and girls are living , and which we spend all our time on , are very painful , " she said			0
" fortunately , we have the capacity to transform pain into the desire to do something about it			0
" want to get involved ? check out this website to see how to help .			0
