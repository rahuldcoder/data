" the only areas left to search are areas ( authorities are ) not able to search on the ground			2
they 're steep cliffs and ravines , and when the weather clears , we 'll hopefully get our helicopter back up there to look , " sgt. @entity19 , a spokeswoman for the @entity20 , said monday			2
it is unlikely @entity6 is still alive given the low temperatures on @entity30 where rescuers have focused their search , authorities said			0
" initially we thought he was probably flying 50 to 60 miles per hour , " @entity34 said , " but after talking to his jump friends , we found more likely he was traveling 80 to 100 miles per hour , which ... in just a matter of a few seconds he 's going to be over a large area			1
and then the other issue is we do n't know exactly what direction he went			0
" in a written statement issued sunday , @entity34 said : " there are cliff areas that could not be searched due to the extreme risk to searchers			0
the @entity20 said they will search those areas by helicopter when weather permits			2
