-- a judge granted a temporary restraining order friday to keep a 13 - year - old girl on life support after she was declared brain dead following a tonsillectomy at a hospital in @entity8 , @entity9			1
@entity11 judge @entity10 gave the family of @entity13 and hospital officials until monday to appoint an independent physician to further examine the girl			2
@entity13 was declared brain dead december 12 , three days after she was to have surgery to remove her tonsils			1
doctors at @entity21 in @entity8 had recommended the tonsillectomy and other procedures to treat @entity13 's sleep apnea , weight gain , inability to concentrate , short attention span and other afflictions			1
her surgery initially appeared to have gone well , said @entity30 , @entity13 's grandmother who is herself a nurse and who saw the girl in the recovery room			0
but soon after surgery , @entity13 's condition quickly deteriorated and she went into cardiac arrest , her family said			2
a scan showed two - thirds of @entity13 's brain had swollen			1
doctors declared her brain - dead , and days later planned to take her off life support until receiving a cease - and - desist letter from the family 's attorney , @entity46			1
@entity13 's mother , @entity48 , who has maintained a constant vigil by her daughter 's bedside , said her daughter has responded to touching and shows other signs of life			2
in a meeting thursday night between @entity13 's family and doctors , attorney @entity46 said the girl 's mother pleaded with doctors to insert a feeding tube , keep her on a ventilator through @entity61 and give the family 48 hours ' notice should doctors decide to take @entity13 off of life - support			1
in their written response to the family 's court motion friday , attorneys for the hospital said @entity69 had " no duty to continue mechanical ventilation or any other medical intervention for its deceased minor patient @entity13			2
" " ms. @entity13 is deceased as a result of an irreversible cessation of all functions of her entire brain , including her brain stem , " the response said , adding , " tragically , ms. @entity13 is dead and can not be brought back to life			1
" attorney @entity46 said the family was told by hospital officials thursday that it was " time to come to a consensus about terminating life support			1
" the attorney said the family was told , in effect , " she is morally and legally dead , dead , dead			0
" hospital officials have publicly called on the family to allow them to discuss @entity13 's case , citing patient privacy laws that currently prevent them from disclosing information			2
" our hearts go out to the family and friends of @entity13			2
this is a tragic situation , " dr , @entity96 , the hospital 's chief of pediatrics , said in a statement			0
" we want the public to know that the family has not permitted us to discuss the medical situation			0
we implore the family to allow the hospital to openly discuss what has occurred and to give us the necessary legal permission -- which it ( the family ) has been withholding -- that would bring clarity , and we believe , some measure of closure and deeper understanding of this medical case , " the statement read			0
@entity13 's uncle , @entity116 told @entity0 that the girl 's mother wanted to keep @entity13 on life support but hospital representatives informed them that long - term life support was not an option			1
@entity69 spokeswoman @entity122 said that the hospital has no policy about terminating life support			1
" we work with the family to determine when that will happen , " she said in an e-mail			0
" there are instances when the coroner may request termination , but we always work with the family to respect their wishes			0
" attorney @entity46 said @entity13 's family has repeatedly asked doctors for the release of @entity13 's medical records so he can hire an independent physician to determine whether she is legally dead			1
" their response has been , ' it 's not our policy while providing care , ' " said @entity46			0
in a statement , @entity69 denied the family 's assertion			0
" @entity13 's family has the same access to our medical records as the family of any patient at @entity151			0
all families have the right to review the record while the patient is in the hospital , and have access to the entire record after the hospitalization has ended			0
" @entity46 said court intervention was the only remedy to prevent doctors from terminating the life support			1
@entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
