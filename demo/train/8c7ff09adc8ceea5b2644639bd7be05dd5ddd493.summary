@entity0 , @entity1 -- two hundred years after his birth in a log cabin in @entity6 , @entity3 continues to fascinate			1
@entity3 is invoked by politicians of both parties , observes historian @entity9 his moral clarity , his extraordinary gifts with language , his decisive role in preserving the @entity11 and what some consider his ultimate martyrdom combine to make of @entity3 a mythic figure with a firm hold on our collective imagination			1
in conjunction with the bicentennial of his birth , a slew of new books on the 16th @entity25 president have appeared			1
among the best - reviewed is the biography " @entity30 " ( @entity32 ) by historian @entity9 , who drew on new research for his portrait			1
@entity2 talked with @entity9 about @entity3 's impact on the country , president @entity38 's affinity for him and what lessons @entity3 has to offer @entity25 of today			1
the following is an edited version of @entity9 's comments : @entity2 : thousands of books have been published about @entity3			1
why did you decide to write a new biography ? @entity9 : probably surprising to many is how many new discoveries have been made about @entity3 just in the last 15 to 20 years			1
for example , about 20 years ago , a professor in @entity48 wondered if there were still @entity3 legal papers laying around in the almost 100 courthouses in @entity48			2
so he got together a group of students , and they began searching those courthouses , and they found [ thousands ] of @entity3 legal documents			2
... i wanted to treat more of that part of @entity3 's life -- he spent nearly 24 years as a lawyer			1
this is just an example of what we have discovered only in recent years			0
see ireporters don stovepipe hats like @entity3 @entity2 : more than 100 years after his death , why does @entity3 still fascinate us ? white : i think for many he embodies the best of @entity25			1
the fact that a man of such humble origins , with less than one year of formal education , could , in his term , have the " right to rise			0
" he felt that @entity25 was a land where we should not put any shackles or weights upon people			2
one reason he hated slavery so much was that it puts weights upon people			0
... i 'm going to be speaking in @entity83 and @entity84 in april , and people there are fascinated with @entity3 for the same reason			2
now , to be sure , @entity38 has shone a large spotlight on @entity3			1
i think this is somewhat responsible for rediscovering this man at the beginning of the @entity3 bicentennial in the year 2009			2
@entity2 : why do you think @entity38 has made such a point of aligning himself with @entity3 ? white : it 's become commonplace for politicians of both parties to invoke @entity3 -- literally wrap themselves in the mantle of @entity3 -- especially at political conventions			1
but when i read " @entity100 " it came through to me that this is something quite genuine			0
as @entity38 is seeking to define his own vocation as a politician , he found in @entity104 -- @entity3 's inclusive spirit , @entity3 's humble demeanor , @entity3 's great gift with words -- he found here some of the very values that he wished to inculcate into his own life			1
... i think he picked up on the symbolism of @entity3 , using the very same ceremonial @entity111 [ for his swearing - in ] , picking as his theme a " new birth of freedom , " re-enacting the final 137 miles of the train ride [ @entity3 took to @entity117 for his first inaugural ]			0
it 's fascinating that here this @entity121 - @entity25 politician is finding a model and a mentor , and i think it is the values that @entity3 represents that @entity38 is finding			1
@entity2 : some people have noted temperamental similarities between @entity3 and @entity38			1
is there any justification for that comparison ? white : i think there is			0
@entity38 comes across as a person of kind of calm , reassuring demeanor			2
he is a person who likes to circle around questions and problems			0
he was as interested , as i 've come to understand , when he taught law in @entity140 , in asking questions as in coming up with answers			0
this is exactly the way @entity3 approached reality			0
they both have a real sense for oratory , how less is more ; they have a compelling way of speaking			0
... to be sure there are real differences			0
[ @entity38 ] had an education far beyond @entity3 's			1
it 's yet to be determined how @entity38 will emulate @entity3			1
i would argue that @entity3 had to teach himself to be president			2
he was very aware of his inadequacies , certainly in administration and military policy			0
and i think with all the fanfare for @entity38 i think he understands that he has to teach himself how to be president , too			2
ireport.com : send your rendition of @entity3 's second inaugural speech @entity2 : [ historian ] @entity164 suggests @entity3 's attitudes on race were not as enlightened as some would like to think			1
in your book , you say it 's important to consider the context in which @entity3 articulated his racial views			2
white : this is the difficulty ... with understanding the context			0
@entity3 's racial attitudes ... were left of center and moving in that direction , toward the left			1
... @entity3 said in one of his debates with @entity181 , " it 's not that i 'm about to marry a black woman , it 's not that i think blacks should serve on juries			2
" ... he then comes back and says , " but this black woman , in terms of her right to eat the bread she earns from her own hands is every bit my equal and the equal of every person here because if you 're referring to the @entity197 , all men are created equal			0
" even the most radical abolitionist would probably not have granted social equality [ between blacks and whites ]			0
@entity2 : what did you discover about the evolution of @entity3 's religious views ? white : his religious odyssey comes to more of a full scope during his presidency			1
... we see him re-appropriating elements of the @entity214 faith -- not his parents ' tradition -- but a more rational , logical , thoughtful old - school presbyterian tradition [ after he became president ]			0
this is a story that has not often been told , and i think it 's an important part of understanding the moral core of @entity3			1
it was n't simply that he had an ethic , which he certainly did , but there was a theological kind of undergirding of that ethic that came to the forefront more in his years as president			0
@entity2 : do you feel @entity3 is our greatest president ? white : well , there are a lot of great presidents			2
... certainly the times make the man			0
@entity3 led us through the greatest crisis of our nation 's history -- an internal crisis -- even as @entity241 is one of our greatest presidents , who led us through two other great crises -- the @entity244 and @entity245 it 's hard to compare people of different eras , but i think @entity3 sort of incarnates the best values of the @entity25 experience			1
@entity2 : what can we all learn from @entity3 ? white : if there is an ultimate value in doing a biography of @entity3 , it is that @entity3 offers some wisdom for today			2
we do n't have to be political leaders to catch the values -- his humility , the strength of his character and moral vision , the fact that words fiercely mattered to him and should matter to us			1
... he said at the second inaugural , " with malice toward none , with charity for all			0
" i was intrigued to find ... that people wore mourning badges right after his death that said , " with malice toward none , with charity for all			0
" @entity3 did n't just speak these words , he had come to embody these words for the people who knew him and loved him			0
and so these values are not simply back there in the 19th century			0
they 're values that we can embody and work with in the 21st century .			0
