-- fraternities might seem to have a @entity3 - like uniform : khaki pants , flip - flops , t - shirts or maybe @entity8 button - downs			2
one e-mail from 19 - year - old @entity10 proved that it can be far more tailored than that			1
by now you 've probably heard about that e-mail , wherein @entity10 tells his fraternity brothers at @entity17 's @entity16 chapter that they are " poorly dressed			1
" the self - proclaimed " fratshionistau " then listed a few sartorial tips that have been hailed by @entity19 and other men 's fashion experts as sound advice			2
his recipe for a well - dressed brother is simple : wear @entity31 tones ( extra points if you can manage burgundy ) , cuff your pants , sport a statement scarf and seek inspiration from innovative labels like @entity36 's talking about the abstraction			0
oh , and get a tailor , because your clothes do n't currently fit your body			0
to be on the safe side , purchase @entity44 's @entity43 suit			0
a native of @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity10 said he had long ascribed to the fashion " my parents decided for me , " which he calls " eccentric rower preppy			1
" he 's now drawn to a more nostalgic " @entity57 " style , thanks to a freshman - year introduction to beat poetry			1
( @entity10 is dual majoring in @entity59 and neuroscience			1
) " i fell in love with 1950s @entity62 , this idea of refining yourself			0
you look at the fashion they had and the way ( the beat poets ) dressed and what they inspired , being very nationalistic , very cool			2
i got inspired by that , " he said			0
conveniently , key items from @entity74 styles are available at modern malls , he said , like cardigan sweaters ( @entity10 prefers @entity78 's rugby collection ) , chukka boots a @entity44 or @entity81 , and thick - rimmed @entity80			1
" @entity57 " style encompasses a lot of looks , said @entity86 's senior associate market editor , @entity87 : " everything from @entity62 - made heritage brands to prep to regional influences			1
@entity92 boots , @entity94 ties and nautical stripes can all be considered @entity57			1
" the young man 's fashion takedown might seem like a bold change from the " @entity102 " fraternity stereotype ( and a bold move for a new brother ) , but according to @entity103 , a contributing editor to @entity104 , the looks @entity106 advocates have roots on campus			1
although it might feel like high style on the average college campus these days , fraternity members at @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 were running counter to the formal fashion of the early 1900s			2
with colorful scarves and sport coats , the @entity119 elite pioneered casual , stylish men 's fashion , said @entity103 , who co-curated a recent exhibition of @entity119 fashion at the museum at the @entity127 in @entity128			2
" it only became this new - conservative look of the @entity132 establishment in the 1950s , " @entity103 said			0
@entity134 , it became a status symbol , a look associated with power , @entity103 said			0
it was revived in the early 1980s , when it became known as " preppy			0
" the current revival of @entity119 style , and the broader @entity57 look , is driven by close , fitted @entity145 tailoring and @entity36 fashion sense , @entity103 said			1
the notion that clothes have a deeper , non-verbal communication is something @entity10 subscribes to			2
" i view fashion as a means to present yourself before you open your mouth , " said @entity10 , the self - proclaimed " apparel chair " of his @entity16 chapter			1
" it 's another way for you to communicate with someone			0
it 's not the only way , of course			0
i think the content of what you say is more important than how you look , but it can hinder or further how you frame your message			0
" @entity103 could n't agree more : " not only do clothes talk , but they never shut up			0
you keep looking at people , you learn more and more about them from their clothes			0
" " one thing that interested me about ( @entity10 ) is , he is very much aware of the details , " @entity103 said			2
" mentioning the @entity31 tones and cuffed trousers : he was aware that that little , two - inch strip of cloth at the bottom of your legs was somehow important , that that cuff somehow separated the men from the boys , the well - dressed from the not - well - dressed , the knowing from the not knowing			0
" understanding fashion is what @entity10 feels he can contribute to @entity16			1
counter to the stereotypes of hazing , lecherous , binge - drinking party animals , he said , fraternity life is about trying to " find kindred spirits that you can connect with on a deeper level			2
" @entity10 hopes to one day own a store in his @entity47 hometown with his older sister , who is interning in the fashion industry while pursuing a law degree in @entity128			1
for now , he said , his fraternity brothers welcomed his e-mail with good humor and respect for his opinion , even if they did n't share his passion for fashion			1
they continued to encouraged him when the note spread on the @entity207 , despite some bloggers and journalists calling it " ridiculous			0
" " some might have seen this as a negative , ' oh , how embarrassing ' kind of thing , " @entity10 said , but , " i only received support from ( my brothers			1
) i guess a thank you note is in order			0

@entity17 *student* @entity10 *wanted* to help his fraternity brothers dress better
@entity10 recommends a modern take on *classic* @entity57 looks
@entity10 ' said his fraternity brothers support his interest in fashion
