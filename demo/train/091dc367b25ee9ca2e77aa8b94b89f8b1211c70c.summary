-- the @entity1 has launched its own investigation into claims highlighted by @entity0 that too many of its student - athletes read poorly			1
chancellor @entity6 posted an open letter to campus , saying : " i take these claims very seriously , but we have been unable to reconcile these claims with either our own facts or with those data currently being cited as the source for the claims			2
moreover , the data presented in the media do not match up with those data gathered by the @entity19			0
" the university also released some of its own data , which it claims shows that the allegations of academic problems highlighted in a @entity0 investigation by whistle - blower @entity26 are not true			1
@entity6 's letter said : " only two of the 321 student - athletes admitted in 2012 and 2013 fell below the @entity32 and @entity33 levels that were cited in a recent @entity0 report as the threshold for reading levels for first - year students			1
and those two students are in good academic standing			0
" but a larger analysis of @entity32 and @entity33 entrance exam scores released to @entity0 show the situation is not so bright			0
@entity1 data shows that , since 2004 , the university admitted 34 players to play in the revenue - generating sports of football and basketball who scored below a 400 on the @entity32 verbal test , or below a 16 on the @entity33 reading and @entity54 tests			1
that 's 10 % of those athletes admitted under " special talents " to play football or basketball			0
@entity26 reported 8 % of student - athletes playing in revenue sports were reading below a third - grade level as part of a research project that was university approved			1
however , @entity26 's research included other factors , and used a smaller sample size			2
on thursday , @entity0 talked to a psychologist who administered the academic achievement test that @entity26 used in her research , and that psychologist backed up @entity26 's findings			2
the psychologist , who asked not to be identified , said a spreadsheet with the results of the tests was given to @entity1 academic support center staff each year the testing was done			2
" you have to do really badly on that test to get a low score , " the psychologist also said , noting that some student - athletes scored even lower on later evaluations			1
" i have the utmost confidence in @entity26 's integrity and she 's trying to do the right thing , and always has , " the psychologist said			2
the @entity32 and @entity33 thresholds were used by @entity0 , after consulting several experts , to represent a reading level too low to understand college textbooks			0
that was the standard applied to several universities as part of @entity0 's national look at the reading levels of college athletes			0
@entity1 officials talked with @entity26 , a learning specialist , on monday in what they said was a " cordial " meeting ; @entity26 described it as being " condescending			1
" but the university continues to dispute her findings			0
and her university approval to do the research was pulled thursday by @entity1 , @entity26 said , partly because she was aware of the identity of some of the athletes in her findings			1
while @entity1 says it will do its own review of what @entity26 found , it also disputes the claim that it admitted students who could not do work at @entity1			1
" there have been 34 students evaluated in detail at length and we believe were capable of succeeding here , " said @entity118 , @entity1 's director of undergraduate admissions , referring to the 10 % who scored below the threshold			0
" when we evaluate someone , we do n't just rely on one score			0
" @entity128 also pointed out that in 2013 , no student - athletes were admitted with scores below the threshold , and in 2012 , only two student - athletes in the revenue sports were admitted with scores that low			1
@entity0 first requested comment from the university on @entity26 's research back in september			0
the university originally said it was not aware of the research , then later said the university would not comment			0
only after the story was published has the university responded to @entity0 's requests for information			0
two years ago , @entity1 's own internal investigation uncovered an academic scandal in which several athletes were enrolled in classes where little or no work was required			2
the @entity152 attorney general recently indicted a former professor who allegedly accepted money for teaching those " no - show " classes			0
@entity26 , who has spoken publicly about that scandal and has received threats since talking to @entity0 , insists she worked with several student - athletes who would not have been able to read this article on the day they were admitted to college			1
" we were going back to letters and sounds , " @entity26 told @entity0 , recounting stories of athletes , one who could not read multisyllabic words .			1

@entity1 will investigate claims regarding student - athletes
@entity26 was *shocked* by the number of @entity1 athletes who *struggled* to read
