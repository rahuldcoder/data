-- people constantly debate whether the phrase , " all publicity is good publicity , " actually has any credence , but in the case of @entity7 , the saying has proven itself true			1
after nearly six months of feverish online debate -- her name ! her lips ! her backstory ! -- the divisive songstress , whose poorly received performance on " snl " launched a thousand blog posts , lands high on this week 's chart			1
her debut album " born to die " debuted at no. 2 on the @entity19 , selling a solid 77,000 ( if not spectacular , considering its marketing budget ) copies			1
impressively , @entity7 accomplished this feat without a single bona fide " hit " to her name			1
although her recent video for " born to die " has amassed over 19 million views , she has only charted one song domestically : " @entity30 , " and that only reached no. 91 on the @entity31			1
understandably , 74 percent of her album sales were digital downloads			2
@entity35 , of course , topped the chart once again , logging her 19th week in first place			1
thanks to massive @entity41 buzz , the blockbuster album moved another 122,000 copies , which means " 21 " has now sold over 100,000 units in 35 separate weeks			1
@entity45 's @entity44 notes that this is the first time an album has done this since @entity50 's " @entity49 , " which logged 49 weeks of sales above 100,000 from 1999 to 2001			2
if @entity35 wins @entity54 at the @entity41 on sunday ( as she is expected to ) , " 21 " should easily blaze past the 7 million mark			0
the only other debuts in the @entity57 were @entity63 's " @entity62 , " which sold 41,000 , and @entity59 's gospel album " @entity60 , @entity61 , " which sold 26,000			2
