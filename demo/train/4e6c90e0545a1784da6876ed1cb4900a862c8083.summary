-- six months after a devastating earthquake struck @entity6 , most governments that promised money to help rebuild the country have not delivered any funds at all , a @entity0 investigation has found			1
donors promised $ 5.3 billion at an aid conference in march , about two months after the earthquake -- but less than 2 percent of that money has been handed over so far to the @entity12 - backed body set up to handle it			1
only four countries have paid anything at all : @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			2
the @entity20 pledged $ 1.15 billion			1
it has paid nothing , with the money tied up in the congressional appropriations process			2
@entity25 promised even more -- $ 1.32 billion			1
it has also paid nothing , although it has written off some of @entity6 's debt			1
former president @entity29 , a @entity12 special envoy for @entity6 , said he plans to put pressure on governments that have been slow to deliver on their promises			1
" i 'm going to call all those governments and say , the ones who said they 'll give money to support the @entity6 government , i want to try to get them to give the money , and i 'm trying to get the others to give me a schedule for when they 'll release it , " @entity29 told @entity0 's @entity34 earlier this week			1
he said the worldwide economic crisis was at least partly to blame			0
" i think that they 're all having economic trouble , and they want to hold their money as long as possible , " @entity29 said			0
altogether , about $ 506 million has been disbursed to @entity6 since the donors ' conference in march , said @entity48 of the @entity49			1
that 's about 9 percent of the money that was pledged			1
but about $ 200 million was money that had been in the pipeline for aid work before the earthquake , and about another $ 200 million went directly to the government of @entity6 to help it get back on its feet , @entity48 explained			1
that has left the commission with about $ 90 million in donations since the conference , @entity48 said			0
there is some dispute about the @entity67 's contribution the bank says it has made available $ 479 million dollars , and of that $ 56.6 million has " already been used " for different government - led projects			2
the @entity67 says that this money was provided directly to the @entity6 government and did not go into the @entity73			1
@entity0 compiled the information for this report by reviewing commission figures and surveying the donors that had made pledges to determine the disposition of those pledges			0
@entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 are also among the countries that have not yet followed through on their pledges , @entity0 found			0
no countries told @entity0 they do not plan to deliver the money eventually			2
the pledges are for fiscal year 2010 - 2011 , so the donors have until the middle of next year to get the funds to the @entity6 recovery commission , @entity48 said			1
@entity12 spokesman @entity94 said wednesday that aid delivery to @entity6 is going relatively well compared to other disaster relief efforts the world body has been involved in			2
" compared with other disasters , coordination systems in @entity6 have actually functioned reasonably well , " he said , adding that there was no requirement for aid efforts to work within systems			2
" but within that constraint , what we 've been trying to do is coordinate the aid responses as best as we can , and we are trying to provide food as quickly as possible , " he said			0
some charities , meanwhile , are spending money as fast as they get it , while others are planning long - term projects			0
@entity115 -- primarily a disaster - relief organization -- has received $ 112 million and spent $ 65 million , it says			0
the group plans to spend more than $ 109 million by the end of the year , spokesman @entity116 told @entity0			0
the @entity119 has spent $ 148 million of the $ 468 million it has taken in , and is holding some money in reserve for more permanent projects such as shelter and water			2
private money has also come in from the @entity127 , from @entity129 telecommunications billionaire @entity128 and @entity83 mining investor @entity130 , but that 's not part of the $ 5.3 billion pledged by countries at the conference in march			1
the january 12 quake left more than 220,000 dead , 300,000 - plus injured and more than 1 million homeless			0
according to recent @entity12 reports , the quake destroyed 60 percent of government infrastructure and left more than 180,000 homes uninhabitable			0
six months later , more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps			0
according to the @entity12 , 1,300 camping sites and 11,000 latrines have been built , and thousands of kilos of food and humanitarian resources have been delivered to those in need			0
@entity0 's @entity148 at the @entity12 contributed to this report .			0
