@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity4 , the portraits always start the same way			1
" i do the eyes first so i get this connection with the face , " he said			0
" i am pretty exhausted after a picture			0
just try staring at a photograph for five hours without any distractions			0
" @entity4 , a professional artist for 40 years , is known for his vivid etchings of politicians , celebrities and athletes			1
today , he has a new subject : fallen members of the military			1
it all started three years ago when the wife of a @entity22 corpsman who was killed in @entity23 asked @entity4 to draw her late husband			1
@entity4 insisted on doing the portrait for free			1
then he had a realization			0
" i looked at my wife and told her what happened and said , ' now we need to do them all , ' " @entity4 remembered			2
" doing them all " meant closing his art gallery and reaching out to the families of fallen service members			1
most of the troops @entity4 draws are @entity37 service members killed in @entity23 and @entity38			1
he has recently started drawing portraits for family members of @entity42 and @entity43 troops killed in those conflicts			1
many families were unsure why someone would offer to do a portrait for them at no cost			2
they wanted to know why someone would volunteer to , as @entity4 puts it , " participate in the worst time of their life			2
" slowly , word among military families spread and requests for portraits began pouring in			1
@entity4 , a @entity58 veteran , grew to know the faces of hundreds of troops lost to war			1
" it breaks my heart to see young people who have died , " he said			0
" it makes me proud that i get a place in their life			0
" it is a punishing regimen			0
before @entity4 puts pencil to paper , he researches the person by reading letters from his or her family and studying the pictures and videos that the family has provided			1
a portrait takes between five and six hours , not including the research			0
he tries to complete two each day			0
so far , @entity4 has done more than 2,000 portraits			1
keeping up with the requests wears down @entity4 , 62 , at a time he thought he would be getting ready to retire			2
a small volunteer group of military families and friends helps him coordinate the portraits and has set up a foundation to bear some of the costs involved			1
drawing celebrities and athletes allowed him to make a good living , he said , but with the military portraits , @entity4 says he has found his " true calling			1
" " i work with dead people every day , " @entity4 said with a deep sigh			2
" a different two every day who have stories , whose families love ' em , whose families are going to miss ' em forever			0
" it 's what i have assumed as my task			0
" more than 1,000 @entity37 military personnel have been killed in @entity38 , and more than 4,300 have died in @entity23			1
the portraits have a profound impact on the families that defies a simple explanation			2
" it 's not for me , it 's for my daughter , " @entity107 said shortly after receiving @entity4 's portrait of her daughter and late husband			1
" for her to have in her house someday			0
" sgt. @entity115 was killed by a roadside bomb in @entity117 , @entity23 , in 2007 , leaving behind @entity118 and their 4 - year - old daughter , @entity119			2
the day the portrait arrived in the mail , @entity107 was overwhelmed with emotion			0
" it 's magical , " she said while gazing at the picture with @entity119			0
" how can one picture make him look alive ? just for one moment , i thought he was here			0
" @entity4 said the impact of his portraits transcends the politics and controversy surrounding war			2
he is reminded of that every tuesday when @entity135 pulls into @entity4 's driveway in a truck decorated with bumper stickers calling for the pullout of troops from @entity23			1
@entity4 , on the other hand , supported the removal of @entity23 leader @entity143			1
despite their political differences , the two men are friends and close collaborators on the portrait project			0
every week , @entity135 drives 70 miles round trip to pick up and mail @entity4 's portraits			1
he carries with him the framed portrait that @entity4 drew of @entity135 's son @entity151 , an @entity153 lieutenant killed by a bombing in @entity23 in 2003			1
" somehow , the spirit of the person comes through , the soul of the person is right there with the drawing , " @entity135 said			2
" i ca n't explain it			0
" @entity4 also ca n't explain the effect of his portraits or why a successful artist would suddenly decide to begin drawing pictures of an intensely painful subject , free of charge			1
it is a journey , he says , that began years ago with his own experience on the battlefield as a young @entity171 in @entity58			0
" i love drawing pictures , i have always loved it , " @entity4 said			2
" in @entity58 , a lot of the pictures i drew came home when the soldiers and @entity171 did n't			0
" he said his personal war experience changed his perspective on life			0
" i think anybody who served in combat knows what that is : you come home with the nightmares that never go away , " @entity4 said			2
" doing this is finally allowing me to come home			0
" @entity2 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			0
