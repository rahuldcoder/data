@entity0 -- @entity2 is a student at @entity3 , where her favorite class is music			2
the 13 - year - old loves the class			2
" it makes me feel good , " she said			0
and she says about her school life at @entity10 : " this place is good , i like it			0
i want to stay here			0
" but she may have to leave			0
@entity2 's family migrated to the @entity0 from the countryside for work , and @entity10 is a school for migrants			1
but the surrounding community , once filled with families like @entity2 's , is under pressure as the government began dismantling the neighborhood to make way for new development			2
the school , funded by migrant parents , may soon close			2
" the children of the rural migrants wo n't be able to continue to attend school in this area , " said human rights lawyer @entity27 , referring to the area where @entity2 's family lives			1
in @entity34 , families are registered as rural or urban			1
when rural migrants move to the cities they live in a twilight zone : they ca n't access healthcare , social security or even public education as part of the nation 's " hukou " system , which requires household registration			1
migrant workers still must be registered in their rural town of origin , not the city to which they move -- which keeps public services out of reach for many who have flocked to cities for work			1
" what makes this bad is that it violates the rights of migrants to live and work here , " @entity27 said			2
" secondly , and more importantly , it violates children 's rights to get compulsory education because when parents are forced to move back to their hometown			2
@entity0 has made urbanization a main goal for increasing domestic consumption and closing the wealth gap			0
hundreds of millions have moved to the cities from the countryside in search of jobs			2
last year , the urban population of the world 's most populous nation exceeded the rural population for the first time , according to the @entity81			1
but activists say that the government 's own policies are forcing these migrants out of cities and creating an underclass in @entity34			1
about 250 million people -- equivalent to about 80 % of the population of the @entity90 -- are migrant workers in @entity34			1
it 's the children of migrant workers , like @entity2 , who are often hardest hit			1
" they do n't have a lot of connections back home			2
their kids do n't speak much of local dialect , " @entity27 said			0
" the government is forcing these people to move elsewhere without understanding their difficulties			0
" but registration of children is tied to their parents , so children of migrant workers eventually will have to return to their parents ' home village to register and continue their education			1
@entity0 has pledged to reform the hukou system but is hampered because many social services are funded by local cities rather than the national government			1
" the government is trying			0
they 're definitely making efforts , they realize that this is a big problem , " @entity117 of the @entity118 said			0
" the problem is the finances of the health care scheme and education are all done at the local level , so i think it 's very difficult for the government at the national level to say , ' okay , let 's just reform the hukou system '			1
" the political cost of reforming the hukou system is onerous			0
" the mayors and party secretaries of many major cities are concerned that if hukou is freed up , there will be a huge fiscal burden in providing services for these migrants , " said @entity134 , senior associate of the @entity135 and former @entity137 director of @entity34			1
" if you ask the residents , the established residents of the major cities , they would say i do n't want more people coming , this may mean fewer job opportunities for us , " @entity134 added			0
" they also associate inflows of migrant workers in terms of crime , pollution or congestion			1
so this is going to be a political issue			0
and i think it is a political issue that requires very careful management , " he said			0
" @entity34 has been very successful in avoiding some of what i call ' the urban sprawls ' in places like @entity168 or @entity169 or even @entity170			1
in that sense , it 's going to be a new challenge for @entity34			1
" if reform is on the horizon , it may come too late for @entity2 's family , who is watching their neighborhood being torn down as her father recovers from heart disease			0
" i just hope that my father can get well as soon as possible and that we will be okay , " said @entity2 , breaking down in tears			0
@entity1 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .			0
