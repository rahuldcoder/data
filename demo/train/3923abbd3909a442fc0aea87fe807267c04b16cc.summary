@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 called wednesday for president @entity3 to reverse a policy established last year that kept the suspect in the @entity7 botched jetliner bombing from having been placed on a no - fly list			1
the failed bombing " is a reminder that attempts to attack the @entity15 homeland continue and that @entity16 and affiliated terrorist groups are searching for new ways to use explosive devices and operatives that will not arouse suspicion in order to carry out attacks in this country , " the @entity10 @entity9 wrote wednesday in a letter to the president posted on her web site			1
" we must therefore adjust to meet these developments and stay ahead of them			2
" the chairman of the @entity29 said that the @entity15 government was warned about the radicalization of suspect @entity32 , 23 , of @entity33 , more than a month before he flew from @entity33 to the @entity34 and then to @entity35 , @entity36			1
" yet apparently no action was taken other than to put mr. @entity32 in the @entity38			0
he was not placed on a @entity39 or @entity40 for additional scrutiny and screening , nor was action taken to revoke his visa , " @entity2 said			1
a @entity15 government official said the @entity15 had intelligence more than a month before the attack -- between august and october -- that extremists in @entity49 were discussing operations ; that someone known as " the @entity33 " was mentioned ; and that @entity15 intelligence had a partial name , @entity54			1
federal authorities have charged @entity32 with trying to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as the flight made its final approach to @entity35			0
the device failed to fully detonate , instead setting off a fire at his seat			2
@entity2 said she understood that @entity32 was n't put on a no - fly list because of a policy established last year during the administration of @entity67 , " that limits the circumstances under which the government adds an individual to the watch list			1
" she called the standard " too restrictive " and urged that it be changed			1
" the @entity74 should watchlist , and deny visas , to anyone who is reasonably believed to be affiliated with , part of , or acting on behalf of a terrorist organization , " she said			0
a @entity15 counterterrorism official who asked not to be identified said the change to which @entity2 was referring was " designed to provide a clear , government - wide standard " for putting an individual on a terrorist watch list			1
before the change , law enforcement , intelligence and homeland security agencies and departments involved with the list " applied moderately different standards , " the official said			1
the 2008 change " made it a universal standard			2
" but the official said the change did not make it more difficult to get a name on the watch list and represented the collective thinking of the nation 's intelligence agencies			1
it was not clear who had sought the change , said the official , who would not comment on @entity2 's letter			1
on december 9 , @entity105 , director of the @entity106 at the @entity107 , submitted testimony before the @entity109 explaining the policy : " @entity106 accepts nominations into the @entity112 when they satisfy two requirements , " he said			2
" first , the biographic information associated with a nomination must contain sufficient identifying data so that a person being screened can be matched to or disassociated from a watchlisted terrorist			0
" second , the facts and circumstances pertaining to the nomination must meet the ' reasonable suspicion ' standard of review established by terrorist screening presidential directives			2
reasonable suspicion requires ' articulable ' facts which , taken together with rational inferences , reasonably warrant a determination that an individual is known or suspected to be or has been engaged in conduct constituting , in preparation for , in aid of or related to terrorism and terrorist activities , and is based on the totality of the circumstances			0
" due weight must be given to the reasonable inferences that a person can draw from the facts			0
@entity141 guesses or inarticulate ' hunches ' are not enough to constitute reasonable suspicion			0
" the recommendation came as the administration briefed congressional staffers in private meetings on the matter			0
but several who attended told @entity1 correspondent @entity149 that they learned little			0
congressional hearings are slated for next month			0
complaints also emerged wednesday over how federal authorities handled the matter once it had occurred on christmas day			0
the @entity156 alerted 128 flights that were then en route to the @entity15 from @entity159 and told them to take security precautions , @entity1 's @entity155 reported			1
but more than 3,000 other flights that were in the air at that point were not alerted , which drew criticism from some who asked why the department had concluded that they , too , were not at risk			0
though it was not clear whether @entity16 was involved in the failed @entity7 attack , the terrorist organization 's hallmark is to launch nearly simultaneous attacks , as occurred during the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity15			1
@entity175 , who served as secretary of the @entity156 under the @entity67 administration , urged caution in apportioning blame			0
" i do n't think we have the full picture , " he told @entity1			2
" i do n't want to rush to judgment			2
" he said security officials can not count on perfection and therefore have created a layered security strategy " so that even if one fails , another one gets picked up			0
" @entity175 , who works as a security consultant for companies that make screening devices that can identify explosives hidden under clothing , urged that such machines be deployed more widely			2
the devices are opposed by the @entity194 and privacy advocates			0
and , noting that @entity197 authorities revoked @entity32 's visa this year but did not inform their @entity15 counterparts , @entity175 urged that information - sharing between countries be made more open			1
" we 've got to go back to the @entity203 and fight this fight all over again and tell them that their exalting privacy over security could very well have resulted in tragedy for @entity159 as well as @entity15 , " he said			1
@entity1 homeland security correspondent @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
