a @entity1 tide ripped the @entity2 away from @entity3 tuesday , giving the @entity1 full control of @entity5 and the power to pin down president @entity7 during his last two years in office			1
the thumping win upends the balance of power between the @entity11 and @entity12 only six years after @entity7 's @entity3 swept to power and marginalized @entity1 in a rush to reform health care , @entity16 and pass a huge stimulus package			1
now , it 's @entity3 who will take the back seat on @entity12 , relying mostly on the power of the filibuster to stymie @entity1 and keep @entity7 's legacy intact			1
" for too long , this administration has tried to tell the @entity29 people what is good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies did n't work out , " @entity24 , who is expected to become the next @entity2 majority leader , said in a victory speech			2
in the @entity11 , @entity33 projected the @entity1 will have at least 246 seats , its largest majority since @entity37 ii. speaker @entity36 , celebrating a widened majority , said he is " humbled by the responsibility the @entity29 people have placed with us			1
" " but this is not a time for celebration , " he said			0
" it 's time for government to start getting results and implementing solutions to the challenges facing our country , starting with our still - struggling economy			0
senate majority leader @entity51 , who has controlled the @entity2 since 2007 , congratulated republicans on their victory			2
" the message from voters is clear : they want us to work together , " @entity51 said			0
" i look forward to working with senator @entity57 to get things done for the middle class			0
" @entity7 will make a statement wednesday afternoon on an election many will see as a repudiation of his presidency , and he will host bipartisan leaders friday to try to chart a way forward			1
@entity1 governors win blue states @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 @entity3 losses pile up @entity3 fears of a rout came true , as party candidates struggled to defend seats won in the 2008 @entity7 wave in conservative territory , and could n't get out from under an unpopular president limping through his second term			1
the losses in @entity81 and @entity82 will sting especially hard , as those two states enjoyed a fabled place in @entity7 's world , as drivers of the president 's unlikely bid for the @entity11 in 2008			1
the @entity1 also piled up wins in @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 — all seats that had been in @entity3 hands — to surpass their magic number of six net gains			1
with seats still to be decided in @entity93 , @entity102 and @entity103 -- where there will be a runoff in december -- the @entity1 currently has 52 seats in the @entity2			1
@entity1 numbers stood up when the @entity1 managed to hold on to seats in @entity108 and @entity109 which had threatened to fall from their grasp and complicate the @entity2 math. it was a night of almost unrelenting misery for @entity3 : in @entity82 , @entity114 war veteran @entity113 became the first woman elected to @entity5 from her state , after turning around her @entity1 campaign with an ad in which she boasted about castrating hogs			1
in @entity94 , democrat @entity120 was felled by @entity121 , who repeatedly pummeled her for standing shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity7			1
@entity92 sen. @entity122 lost to @entity123 , who , like @entity124 , is an @entity114 war veteran			2
@entity122 's loss comes despite former president @entity127 's efforts to save him in his beloved home state			0
democrats thought they had @entity81 , with its mix of young voters , @entity132 and students locked down for a generation			2
but sen. @entity135 tumbled to charismatic challenger @entity136 who shook off claims he was anti-women			0
@entity93 @entity3 sen. @entity138 is having a tougher ride than expected against @entity1 challenger @entity140 in a state @entity3 had thought was reliably theirs after @entity7 won it twice			2
a rare ray of hope for @entity3 came in @entity144 , where sen. @entity145 bested challenger @entity146			0
and @entity149 's governor 's mansion reverted to @entity3 when @entity150 unseated @entity151 gov. @entity151 in a marquee race			0
new superstars , new villains and other takeaways governors two other @entity1 governors meanwhile won reelection and stirred buzz for their own 2016 @entity11 prospects — @entity161 in swing state @entity162 , and conservative @entity1 @entity163 in @entity164			2
in @entity167 , @entity165 gov. @entity165 , often mentioned as a possible @entity1 vice presidential pick , strolled to reelection			0
@entity68 -- a traditionally @entity3 state -- elected @entity1 @entity169 as governor			0
and @entity70 , @entity7 's home state , ousted its @entity3 governor			0
republicans will now look with some optimism on the 2016 presidential election			0
but @entity3 will console themselves with a more favorable @entity2 map in two years ' time and the belief that shifting demographics and an unresolved war between the @entity1 grassroots and the party establishment will make the next presidential race a tough climb for the @entity1			1

@entity1 wins @entity2 seats in @entity82 , @entity81 , @entity92 , @entity189 , @entity90 , @entity190 , @entity94
@entity33 projects @entity1 will keep the @entity11 and @entity2
