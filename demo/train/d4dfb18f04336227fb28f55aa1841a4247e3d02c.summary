@entity0 -- more than one in three women have experienced sexual assault , physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime , according to a @entity10 survey			1
the same is true for more than one in four men , according to the @entity12 and @entity13			1
the survey , released wednesday , was based on telephone interviews with more than 16,500 adults in 2010			1
supported by the @entity16 and the @entity17 , the survey was aimed at better describing and monitoring " the magnitude of sexual violence , stalking and intimate partner violence victimization in the @entity21 , " the @entity10 said			0
the report is the first of its kind to provide data on national and state levels , the agency said			1
the data can assist in understanding the burden of violence in populations and address some of the health issues that may accompany it			0
those may include depression , anxiety , low self - esteem and suicide attempts , but also conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders , substance abuse , sexually transmitted diseases and gynecological or pregnancy complications			0
" the health problems caused by violence remind us of the importance of prevention , " said @entity44 , director of the @entity10 's @entity45 , in a statement			0
" in addition to intervening and providing services , prevention efforts need to start earlier in life , with the ultimate goal of preventing all of these types of violence before they start			0
" among the victims of intimate partner violence , more than one in three women reported experiencing multiple forms of rape , stalking or physical violence			1
among males , 92 % reported experiencing physical violence from a partner , while 6 % said they experienced both physical violence and stalking			0
however , nearly half of all women and men reported experiencing " psychological aggression " from an intimate partner			2
nearly one in four women and one in seven men said they had been subjected to " severe physical violence " by an intimate partner -- defined in the report as being hit with a fist or hard object , beaten or slammed against something			1
of the victims of intimate partner violence , nearly three in 10 women and one - tenth of men reported effects of the violence -- fear ; concern for their safety ; symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder ; needing medical treatment or suffering an injury ; contacting a crisis hotline ; needing housing , victim advocate or legal services or missing at least one day of work or school			1
as far as sexual violence , nearly one in five women -- translating to nearly 22 million women in the @entity21 -- reported having been raped or the target of an attempted rape during their lifetime , according to the survey			1
more than half of them , 51 % , said they were raped by an intimate partner and nearly 41 % by an acquaintance			2
of the victims of completed rapes , nearly 80 % said they experienced their first rape before the age of 25 and 42 % before the age of 18			1
about one in five white and @entity121 - @entity21 women and one in seven @entity123 women reported being raped at some point			1
one in 71 men also reported being raped during their lifetime ; of those , more than one - fourth , or nearly 28 % , experienced their first rape when they were 10 or younger			1
more than half the men , or 52 % , said they were raped by an acquaintance			2
@entity129 , director of the @entity130 at the @entity10 , said the organization was very concerned by how large the numbers were , and by how great an impact such abuse has on people 's lives			2
highlighting the extent of the issue may help people to feel more comfortable reporting abuse when it occurs , she said , and aid them in forming healthy relationships			1
" the solution is the same for both sexes , to develop relationships that are strong , that are stable and do not allow violence to be a part of the relationship or of resolving conflict in a relationship , " @entity129 said			2
the report confirms " that sexual violence is one of the most pervasive and serious public health issues in the country , " said @entity155 , prevention campaign specialist at the @entity157			2
" we 've been well aware of the kind of far - reaching effects of sexual violence and the frequency of it , but it 's really helpful to have a current and widespread set of data that can confirm that for us			0
it 's not news to people that have been doing this work , but it is really wonderful that we have now something really concrete that we can point to			2
" the information can " be used to spearhead prevention efforts , " especially if it will be updated annually and trends over time can be tracked , she said			0
@entity155 applauded the report 's focus on male victims of sexual assault			1
" for a number of reasons in our society , it 's really difficult to believe that this happens to men , " she said			0
" it 's difficult for a man to be able to say that this has happened to him because our culture does n't accept male vulnerability			2
our culture really puts a lot of pressure on men to be able to protect themselves			0
" while recent child sex abuse scandals at @entity201 and in the @entity202 have helped focus attention on child sex abuse , she said , male sexual assault " is consistently happening , and it 's not focused on in the way that it needs to be			1
" victimization by stalking was reported by one in six women and one in 19 men , to the point where " they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed , " the survey report said			1
two - thirds of women reported their stalker was an intimate partner , while 80 % of men said the stalker was an intimate partner or acquaintance			2
the most common form of stalking reported was repeatedly receiving unwanted telephone calls along with voice or text messages			2
the estimates for sexual violence , stalking and intimate partner violence are " alarmingly high " for adult @entity21 , with intimate partner violence alone affecting more than 12 million people yearly , the @entity10 said			0
" women are disproportionately impacted			0
they experienced high rates of severe intimate partner violence , rape and stalking and long - term chronic disease and other health impacts , such as ptsd symptoms			0
" the study points to long - term health effects , " everything from irritable bowel syndrome to diabetes , things that will really have an influence on the quality and length of someone 's life , " said @entity155			0
" ... in many ways , there 's a domino effect " of complications and needs after a traumatic experience , she added			0
such victims need coordinated services to ensure healing and prevent a recurrence , the report said , including strengthening the response of the health care system			1
" one way to strengthen the response to survivors is through increased training of healthcare professionals , " the @entity10 said			0
" it is also critically important to ensure that legal , housing , mental health and other services and resources are available and accessible to survivors			0
" holding perpetrators accountable is also a key issue , according to the survey , which noted that survivors of sexual violence , stalking or intimate partner violence may be reluctant to report the behavior because of shame , embarrassment , fear of retribution or a belief that authorities may not support them			1
prevention efforts should also focus on families , particularly on fostering healthy relationships between parents and children and emotionally supportive environments , the survey said			1
" these environments provide a strong foundation for children , " the survey said			0
" ... it is equally important to continue addressing the beliefs , attitudes and messages that are deeply embedded in our social structures and that create a climate that condones sexual violence , stalking and intimate partner violence			0
