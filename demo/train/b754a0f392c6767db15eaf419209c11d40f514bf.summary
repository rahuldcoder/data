, hang out at this week 's giant @entity7 airshow in @entity8 , @entity9 , the folks at @entity2 brought a gift : a sneak preview friday night of the movie " planes			1
" this is @entity15 's answer to the wildly successful animated film " @entity17			1
" " planes " aims to celebrate the same passion for travel across skyways that " cars " did for highways			1
obviously , it 's a safe bet many avgeeks will like it -- it 's about planes ! but are they gon na respect it ? although aviation enthusiasts tend to appreciate authenticity , attention to detail and accuracy , let 's remind ourselves that this is a fantasy movie about planes that talk			1
with that in mind , when it comes to the aircraft , does the movie bear any resemblance to reality ? well , yes , according to @entity45 , a veteran pilot who consulted on the film			1
@entity45 , who has flown planes ranging from small cessnas to fighter jets to @entity51 airliners , spoke with @entity0 from his home in @entity54 's central @entity53 about his work on " planes , " and he pulled back the curtain to reveal a few behind - the - scenes details			1
@entity0 : what does this film offer adult aviation enthusiasts ? what can they look forward to ? @entity45 : at a screening for aviation enthusiasts i went to , the general comments were that , in the air , it was probably the most accurate aviation movie they 've seen			1
that includes animated and non-animated movies			2
but as you watch the movie after a while , i forgot they were airplanes			1
you get so into the story			2
of course , it 's not completely realistic			1
one thing they did with the movie that 's really unique : on the ground , the airplanes are characters			1
... but in the air , with @entity89 executive producing and @entity91 directing -- they really pushed for accuracy			1
these have to be airplanes			2
they have to fly like airplanes			1
they have to move like airplanes			2
we ca n't have them go faster than they would in real life compared to other airplanes			0
so they really did a good job of holding true to the aviation world			1
they really did go to great pains -- even down to the dialogue , the radio transmissions and everything -- to keep it as accurate as they could			0
@entity0 : spill the beans : what inaccuracies did you notice ? and what did the filmmakers change because of your comments ? @entity45 : early on ( in the production ) , i was spending hours watching reels			1
i would have page after page of comments			0
i looked at everything , from toys to artwork to script to story to dialogue , everything			0
i would ( point out things that were inaccurate ) , and it would start affecting the story			0
and when that happens , everybody including @entity91 and the writers gets involved in it			1
for example , @entity141 is a crop duster who dreams about being a racer			1
the problem is : a crop duster is slow by design			0
so @entity141 is physically limited , and he 's going to be racing against planes that can go four times his speed			1
so how do you get around that ? it was challenging			0
i 'd say , ' well , first you 've got to get rid of the spray boom on the bottom ( of the plane )			0
' there 's so much drag from that			1
in the movie , they treated that almost like a vasectomy			1
he does n't want to lose valuable body parts			0
and i thought that was a pretty hilarious way that they did it			0
he needed to reduce drag , increase power -- and i do n't want to give away too much -- but there was a lot they had to work around			0
at one point ( the filmmakers said ) , ' ok , ( @entity141 's ) racing an airliner ... to train himself			1
' and i 'm like , ' that particular airliner he will never , ever , ever be able to catch			0
you need to change that airliner to a commuter turbo prop pulling in the opposite direction so it 's eating headwinds ... mostly , my inputs came in the military flying and the airliner stuff			1
and then looking at controls and things			0
i remember there 's a scene where a big race starts , and they 're starting their engines , and i had them freeze it , and i watched it back again			2
i told them that @entity199 -- one of the main characters -- his propeller is turning backwards			0
they said , " what do you mean it 's turning backwards ? " i said , " well , either his engine is rotating in the wrong direction , or his propeller -- the way it 's built on him right now , he will go backwards			2
" and then they had me look , start looking at all the airplanes			0
and sure enough , i said " that one would spin circles , because one engine was spinning backwards ; one was spinning forwards			0
they did n't know or understand the relationship between rotation direction and pitch of the propeller			0
so there are things in the story that were driven by input that i made , where things like that got changed			2
as an aviation geek , you 're going to find very little wrong with this movie			1
@entity0 : what actual aircraft are represented in this movie ? or are these characters just amalgamations of planes that might look familiar to us but are not actual aircraft that we might see in real life ? @entity45 : some of them are amalgamations			1
@entity141 is an amalgamation of three different types of crop dusters			1
some of them are very close to the real thing			0
there are @entity248 in the movie			2
but a lot of the planes , especially the more modern airplanes like airliners and things like that , are what i call " esque			2
" they 're very 747-esque			0
the @entity262 airplanes are very f - 18-esque , but they 're not f - 18s			0
they 're close enough that any aviation enthusiast would recognize them right away			1
but i think for proprietary reasons , the characters had to be somewhat different			0
@entity0 : do any of the movie characters in " planes " remind you of yourself ? @entity45 : there are a few characters who have some of my call signs from the military days			1
@entity278 and @entity141 are some of my old fighter pilot call signs			1
but i kind of relate to all the characters			0
i really like @entity245 because he 's an old warrior -- an old fighter plane guy from @entity282			2
he carries a lot in the soul of his character and in his voice			0
i can relate to that because of some of the unseen , unknown events in his life in the past that affect who he is			0
why is he quiet ? why is he kind of a shut - in ? i can relate to @entity141 and his energy and wanting to go beyond his limitations			1
i love the fighter characters @entity296 and @entity298 that intercept @entity141			1
the military sequence was the most fun to work on			0
@entity0 : tell us about your aviation background			2
apparently , the filmmakers found someone who knows how to fly a lot of different kinds of aircraft			2
@entity45 : i 'm 55			1
my dad flew bombers in @entity311 and @entity312 during @entity282 and finished his career in @entity314			0
my brothers and i were all fascinated by airplanes ; we grew up near a military base			0
my younger brother and i both had our pilot 's licenses by the time we turned 17 , which was the youngest age to get your pilot 's license			1
i flew anything i could get my hands on			0
in college , i started flying commercially , hauling boxes for @entity331 back when nobody knew who they were			0
i flew old radial engines , twin - engine aircraft called @entity338 taildraggers			0
i ended up flying every single - engine @entity342 , @entity345 and @entity346 built and most of the light twins that they built , like the @entity342 310 , 320 , 340 , 414 , @entity343 , @entity344			0
then i wanted to know if i had what it took to be a fighter pilot			2
i was fortunate enough to get @entity351 pilot training through the @entity352			2
i flew @entity353 and f - 16s before retiring as a major			0
then i chased another dream : to fly airliners			2
i ended up flying 737s , 727s , @entity359			0
so i have a background in general aviation and then military fighters for 15 years and then commercial for the past 27 years			2
my son just got picked by the @entity352 to fly f - 15s , so the aviation legacy is continuing into the third generation .			1

a pilot / film consultant offers an aviation enthusiast 's view of the new @entity2 film " planes "
@entity45 *advised* animators to make changes that made planes fly more realistically
he *suggested* an idea for the movie 's hero , @entity141 , that was " almost like a vasectomy "
executive producer @entity89 and director @entity91 " really pushed for accuracy "
