-- either i had a really short attention span as a kid and never made it past the first verse of a song -- which is entirely possible -- or there are some obscure lyrics to the songs we all know and love			1
" @entity13 " goes on to further explain this little teapot character : i 'm a clever teapot , yes it 's true here let me show you what i can do i can change my handle and my spout just tip me over and pour me out ! 2			1
" @entity20 ? " i 'm impressed that a children 's song contains the word " semaphore			1
" do your ears hang high ? do they reach up to the sky ? do they droop when they are wet ? do they stiffen when they 're dry ? can you semaphore your neighbour with a minimum of labour ? do your ears hang high ? 3			2
" @entity37 " involves terrifying nightmares : last night as i lay on my pillow last night as i lay on my bed last night as i lay on my pillow i dreamed that my @entity42 was dead			1
@entity0 : 10 adult versions of children 's songs 4			1
" @entity46 " i did n't know anything beyond the " oh my darling " chorus , but there 's a whole little tale that goes along with the tragic @entity46			1
there are a few variations			2
one of them goes like this : in a cavern , in a canyon , excavating for a mine @entity56 a miner forty niner , and his daughter @entity61 she was and like a fairy , and her shoes were number nine , wearing boxes , without topses , @entity63 were for @entity46			2
drove she ducklings to the water ev'ry morning just at nine , hit her foot against a splinter , @entity72 into the foaming brine			0
@entity75 lips above the water , blowing bubbles , soft and fine , but , alas , i was no swimmer , so i lost my @entity46			2
how i missed her ! how i missed her , how i missed my @entity46 , but i kissed her little sister , i forgot my @entity46			0
" bingo " the earliest recorded version from 1888 adds two verses after the one that spells out the famous farmer 's dog 's name			1
they went like this : @entity91 , syrs , he brewed goode ayle , and he called it rare good @entity95 ! @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 ! he call 'd it rare goode @entity95 ! @entity103 is notte thys a prettie song ? i thinke it is , bye @entity108 , @entity107 wythe a y -- @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 -- i sweare yt is , bye @entity108 ! @entity0 : look what the dog swallowed ! 6			1
" @entity113 " just keeps going : when the blazing sun is gone , when he nothing shines upon , then you show your little light , @entity113 , twinkle , all the night			0
then the traveller in the dark , thanks you for your tiny spark , he could not see which way to go , if you did not twinkle so			0
in the dark blue sky you keep , and often through my curtains peep , for you never shut your eye , till the sun is in the sky			0
as your bright and tiny spark , lights the traveller in the dark , -- though i know not what you are , @entity113 , twinkle , little star			0
" @entity133 " if you feel the need to deplete the rest of the barnyard denizens of their precious goods after you 've taken the sheep 's wool , you certainly can : @entity141 , cluck , red hen , have you any eggs ? yes sir , yes sir , as many as your legs			2
one for your breakfast and one for your lunch ; come back tomorrow and i 'll have another bunch			0
moo , moo brown cow , have you milk for me ? yes sir , yes sir , as tasty as can be			0
churn it into butter , make it into cheese , freeze it into ice cream or drink it if you please			0
buzz , buzz busy bee , is your honey sweet ? yes sir , yes sir , sweet enough to eat			0
honey on your muffin , honey on your cake , honey by the spoonful , as much as i can make			0
" a tisket , a tasket " you probably know about the green and yellow basket , and you might remember that the person singing the song dropped it			1
after that , the sordid tale goes like this : i dropped it , i dropped it yes , on the way i dropped it a little girlie picked it up and put it in her pocket she was truckin ' on down the avenue , without a single thing to do she was peck - peck - peckin all around when she spied it on the ground she took it she took it my little yellow basket and if she does n't bring it back i think that i shall die ( was it brown ? ) no , no , no , no , ( was it red ? ) no , no , no , no , ( was it blue ? ) no , no , no , no , just a little yellow basket @entity0 : 10 highly decorated animals			1
