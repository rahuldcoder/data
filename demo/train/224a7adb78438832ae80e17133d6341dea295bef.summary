@entity0 , @entity1 -- a man suspected of murdering a doctor in @entity0 , @entity1 , is trying to skirt the @entity6 justice system by fleeing to the @entity8 island territory of @entity9 , according to prosecutors			1
dr. @entity11 , a dermatologist , was murdered in his @entity0 office in october , 2006			2
" he 's doing everything possible to protect himself , " said @entity13 , chief of criminal prosecution for the @entity15 in @entity1			2
" at the end of the day , he 's making a mockery of both @entity8 law and @entity6 law			1
" after fleeing to @entity9 , @entity21 , 29 , turned himself in to @entity8 authorities and allegedly confessed to murdering dr. @entity11 in october , 2006			1
@entity23 , dr. @entity11 's son , said he has seen a four - page confession in which @entity21 admits to attacking and killing @entity11 in his @entity0 office			1
despite the alleged confession , @entity21 is beyond the reach of @entity6 law enforcement			1
as a @entity8 national on @entity8 soil , he can not be sent to the @entity6 for trial , according to a 2002 extradition treaty between the two countries			1
the @entity6 , by contrast , is allowed to extradite @entity6 citizens to @entity8 , under the treaty			1
@entity6 sens. @entity37 and @entity38 , both of @entity1 , sent letters to secretary of state @entity41 asking for help extraditing @entity21			1
in response to the senators , the @entity43 wrote it " will continue to make every effort with the government of @entity8 to see that justice is served in this case			1
" sens. @entity38 and @entity37 also wrote the @entity8 government requesting extradition			1
@entity8 @entity53 spokesperson , @entity52 , responded " the @entity8 government will not be able to extradite mr. @entity21			1
" " @entity8 laws provide in that case for trial on @entity8 territory by @entity8 justice , " he said in a statement			1
@entity13 of the @entity15 said he favors extradition over a @entity8 trial because he believes @entity8 laws are more lenient			2
he said a life sentence there is only 22 years			0
in @entity1 , @entity13 said , murder is punishable by a minimum of 20 years in prison and possibly much more			2
" it goes up to 60 or 80 or 100 years , possibly life , possibly the death sentence , depending on the facts surrounding the crime , " @entity13 said			0
hoping to persuade the @entity8 to extradite @entity21 , @entity13 and the @entity73 family said they would not seek the death penalty in the case			1
there is currently a moratorium on the death penalty in @entity1			2
according to the victim 's son , @entity23 , @entity21 first met dr. @entity11 in 2002 when he was living in @entity0 and went to see him for an acne problem			1
his father prescribed a popular acne medication , which , according to @entity23 , @entity21 said made him impotent			0
it is believed this is the only time the two met before the night of the murder			0
@entity21 's father , dr. @entity90 , said his son was an " okay kid who had a little depression			2
" he said his son took just two pills , but that the acne medication made him psychotic			0
dr. @entity11 's daughter , @entity96 , found his body in his office			0
" i could see on the second closed door that there was blood across it , " she told @entity2			0
" i knew that somebody had killed him			0
" @entity23 said his father was stabbed more than 20 times			0
for months , the case went unsolved , even though authorities said there was dna evidence at the scene			0
then , over the summer , investigators got a tip from a @entity111 on leave from @entity113			0
the @entity111 said a friend told him , " i think my former roommate killed someone			0
" the @entity111 reached out to the @entity118 through a posting they had made on myspace.com and also contacted @entity0 police			2
he told the @entity73 family @entity21 was living in @entity122 around the time of the murder			2
the family believes @entity21 drove from @entity122 to @entity0 , killed dr. @entity11 , and then drove back to @entity122 , reportedly telling friends he had " completed his mission			1
" the @entity73 family said video surveillance from dr. @entity11 's office building shows @entity21 entering and leaving the premises on the night of the crime			1
using the @entity111 's tip , dna evidence and the surveillance video @entity0 police got a warrant to arrest @entity21			1
but before they could track him down , @entity21 fled to @entity9			1
so far , @entity21 has yet to be charged with a crime			0
he is being held in jail on the @entity141 of @entity142			0
the @entity8 government did not return @entity2 's phone calls for this story			2
@entity96 and @entity23 said they will continue to fight for his extradition			0
" we 're gon na go until there 's absolutely nothing more we can do , " @entity148 said			0
" ' til we get justice			0
