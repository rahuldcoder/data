@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 lawmakers sunday offered a new proposal to end a political standoff with president @entity6 over complaints from the losers of september 's parliamentary vote			1
@entity6 is refusing to swear in the new parliament until an electoral court he established in december can review complaints from losing candidates			1
he has refused two previous calls by lawmakers to dissolve that body , which members of the @entity17 say is unconstitutional			1
the latest proposal , floated by lawmakers on sunday , says criminal cases stemming from the election will be prosecuted based on @entity1 's constitution and election laws and that members of parliament would retain their immunity			1
it drops references to a " special court , " however			1
no decision from @entity6 's office was expected until monday , said one of the lawmakers , @entity31			1
@entity6 's office has not returned repeated calls from @entity2 for comment			2
@entity6 's office on wednesday announced a one - month delay in inaugurating parliament , saying that the special court on election fraud needed more time to investigate complaints from losing candidates			1
the decision drew criticism from the @entity45 mission in @entity1 and concern from analysts that it could spark ethnic divisions and more violence			0
@entity1 's existing electoral bodies , the @entity52 and @entity53 , have reviewed the results of last year 's election			0
in november , the @entity56 threw out more than 1 million ballots from around 3,000 polling stations because of suspected fraud			2
the decision resulted in losses for candidates from @entity6 's power base in the largely @entity65 south , where much of the fighting between @entity68 guerrillas and @entity69 and @entity1 troops is taking place			2
the losing candidates argue that their constituents were unable to vote because of violence and intimidation , and that @entity65 will feel increasingly alienated from the government and turn back to the @entity68			0
" the most important thing that is being ignored in these legalistic discussions and political maneuvers is the people of this country			0
where do they fit in ? where do they belong ? " said @entity84 , one of about 250 losing candidates who are scheduled to meet with @entity6 this week			2
in @entity84 's home province of @entity90 , all 11 parliament seats went to the province 's @entity92 minority			2
in one district , only 3 people out of 100,000 cast their ballots			0
he blamed forces outside the country for pushing ordinary @entity1 " into this corner			0
" " we are the people of this country , " @entity84 said			0
" everyone is interfering -- embassies , warlords , drug lords			0
they are all stepping on the people of this country			0
we want a voice in this country			0
" @entity6 , whose own 2009 re-election was marred by allegations of widespread fraud , appeared to concede to lawmakers ' demands on saturday and offered to convene parliament on wednesday			1
but under his offer , the inauguration would take place only if lawmakers accept any decision made by the special court , lawmaker @entity117 said saturday			1
lawmakers countered @entity6 by asking him to dissolve the special court and have the nation 's @entity125 investigate the cases			1
@entity6 also rejected that proposal			2
@entity2 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
