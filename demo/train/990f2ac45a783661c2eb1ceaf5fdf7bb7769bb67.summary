-- contrasting @entity2 's upcoming visit to @entity3 with @entity6 president @entity5 's recent tour indicates seismic shifts not only within @entity3 but also in terms of global power			1
on this visit , only @entity2 's second to @entity3 since he became president ( @entity5 visited @entity3 during his first foreign tour as head of state , in march this year ) , he will be visiting a continent which feels increasingly less beholden to @entity17 dictates			1
@entity20 's growing economic influence in @entity3 , which generated more than $ 160 billion in bilateral trade in 2011 ( when @entity17 merchandise trade with @entity3 was worth just $ 95 billion ) , plays an important role in this shifting sentiment			1
read this : @entity2 's goal in @entity3 : @entity20 an interesting characteristic of the recent @entity6 visit to @entity3 was the virtual lack of any protest -- and this has also been the case for previous visits by @entity6 heads of state			1
in @entity3 , where @entity2 will be visiting , the politically powerful umbrella group for the country 's unions , the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) , will be throwing its weight behind the " @entity45 " campaign , which seeks to call on " millions " on the @entity42 continent " outraged at the horrifying record of @entity17 foreign policy			1
" while @entity20 seems an easy target in terms of its own unflattering human rights record and lack of democracy -- particularly for many @entity42 post-colonial states that have waged wars against the tyranny of imperialism -- reaction is surprisingly mute			2
one of the reasons for this is that @entity6 oppression is viewed as largely reserved to its domestic sphere			0
@entity17 , particularly in the wake of its " @entity61 " and its various military interventions , has made much of the developing world , @entity3 included , suspicious of its freedom - promoting agenda			2
the often patronizing , strings - attached variety of aid given by the @entity17 smacks to many @entity42 leaders of neo-colonial paternalism			1
@entity20 , by comparison , is loath to interfere in @entity42 internal affairs , doling out aid to democrats , autocrats and kleptocrats alike			1
@entity20 's " non-interference " policy is warmly welcomed by many @entity42 states , although to what degree @entity20 can maintain such a stance as its presence grows , remains to be seen			2
read this : economist @entity83 , ' @entity20 can transform @entity3 ' certainly , it has deployed peacekeepers to troubled regions such as @entity86 and the @entity87 and has offered assistance in combating @entity90 militancy and piracy in @entity92 and @entity93 respectively , but only hesitantly			2
in @entity94 , where it had a virtual monopoly on brokering peace between the north and the south , it engaged from a distance			0
in official discourse , @entity20 frequently insists that it has no intentions to build military or naval bases in @entity3			2
this can be contrasted with the @entity17 camp @entity105 on the coast of @entity107 and the setting up of the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , responsible for military operations in 53 @entity42 countries			2
the @entity17 has let it be known that it is not impressed with certain aspects of the warming relations between @entity20 and @entity3			1
former secretary of state @entity116 , on her 2012 trip to @entity3 asserted that the @entity17 would continue to stand up on human rights issues , " even when it might be easier or more profitable to look the other way , to keep the resources flowing " -- a comment widely believed to be aimed at @entity20			1
this statement goes to the heart of a much broader issue regarding @entity20 's presence in @entity3 and how it differs from @entity127 engagement			0
@entity20 has a fundamentally different conception of human rights			0
in @entity20 's view , developing impoverished regions is the most fundamental step in addressing human misery			0
as the @entity6 proverb goes : " to get rich , build roads first ! " it is for this reason that @entity20 sees its vast infrastructure and aid projects in @entity3 as a far more sincere gift to the @entity42 people than that of democracy			1
additionally , @entity20 is itself a highly autocratic state which has deployed a rapid and often coercive development model to bring its own people out of poverty ( some 350 million and counting )			0
this is the only political and economic recipe it knows			0
while many @entity42 states welcome a vast trading partner like @entity20 no longer holding them hostage to the fluctuations of @entity127 markets , there is equally a danger of over-enthrallment			0
research findings on @entity42 people 's feelings towards @entity20 ( as opposed to their leaders ) are mixed , with sporadic cases of anti-chinese sentiment in countries such as @entity162 and @entity163 offset by a cautiously optimistic attitude toward the economic development and aid that they bring			1
@entity20 's investment on the continent is inextricably bound to securing access to @entity42 markets and resources -- a reciprocity which is referred in @entity6 parlance as " win - win			1
" and yet , when analysing overall trade patterns , the vast majority of @entity42 exports are raw materials while imports consist mainly of manufactured goods			0
this resembles a non-value - added economic pattern which harks back to the days of @entity186 colonialism			0
the official @entity6 line is that , with increasing @entity6 fdi , the setting up of @entity191 and a growing @entity42 manufacturing base , this unhealthy pattern will change			2
a cynical retort to this is that @entity20 is primarily concerned with winning the scramble for global resources ( for which the @entity17 is its major competitor ) and @entity42 welfare comes far second			1
while issues of humanitarianism and combatting terrorism will be high on @entity2 's agenda , the administration has woken up to the fact that investment is also a priority			0
@entity42 have @entity20 to thank for that			0
the fact that @entity2 's upcoming visit is readily cast in the shadow of @entity20 also suggests that @entity3 is increasingly becoming a site of struggle for broader geostrategic influence between the two powers			1
its significant mineral reserves , strategic position and growing economy make it an important pivot			0
this puts @entity42 leaders in a somewhat enviable position and if they play their cards right , they stand to benefit from both the @entity223 and the @entity224			0
the opinions expressed in htis commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

president @entity2 visiting an @entity3 ' increasingly less beholden to @entity17 dictates '
@entity6 influence growing in @entity3 , @entity17 influence *waning* , says @entity227
@entity20 offers trade and aid without interfering in @entity42 internal affairs
@entity3 is site of struggle for geostrategic influence between @entity17 and @entity20 , says @entity227
