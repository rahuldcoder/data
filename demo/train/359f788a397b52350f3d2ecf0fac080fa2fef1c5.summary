-- the @entity2 regime under president @entity3 approached the outset of the @entity6 awakening in @entity7 and @entity8 in a state of politico - psychological denial			1
pronouncing that @entity2 was immune from the tectonic shifts in the political landscape of the @entity14 because of its @entity16 credentials and steadfastness against @entity18 , @entity3 's regime had a rude awakening when the youth of @entity21 in southern @entity2 protested openly in march 2011 for their individual rights and against the systemic corruption of the ruling elite			1
the regime cynically labeled the protestors as foreign agents and terrorists and opted deliberately for armed repression of its own citizens			1
the peaceful protests quickly spread to other urban centers , and the tragic pattern of violent repression and loss of life has characterized the now long and painful agony of the @entity2 people whose suffering is worsening			1
it is important to note that in the first instance @entity3 was given a pass and political space to get in front of the reform movement by his own people , the @entity6 countries and the international community for two basic reasons : first , the prospect of instability and , in the worst case scenario , civil war and sectarian violence in @entity2 threatens @entity2 's neighbors , the region and the international community as a whole ; second , @entity3 came to power in 2000 with the aura of a young reformist president and the promise of a " @entity61			1
" there was the hope that in the wake of the popular uprisings in the @entity6 world he would translate his perceived reformist tendencies into action , perhaps as @entity69 of @entity70 was doing			0
@entity71 turned out to be a false reformer			0
i remember a meeting i had with him in 2003 in @entity76 , and i asked him why the reform movement seemed to be stalled in @entity2			1
he answered that the people had to be ready for structural reforms and one had to proceed slowly and deliberately with , first , administrative reforms			0
i concluded at the time that he was in no hurry to push for reforms , but was struck when i heard this same incremental approach repeated in public statements by the regime in @entity76 in the spring and summer of 2011			0
it was clear that @entity3 and his circle had opted for regime survival at all costs and to try to get away with the minimal reforms possible that they could control and dictate			1
that approach has led to the deepening crisis in @entity2 today , with increasing military defections to the @entity96 and growing unrest and clashes in the country that is now spreading to the key cities of @entity101 and @entity76			1
when these two urban centers become the focal point of struggle , the end of the regime will be at hand			2
no one can predict when and how the regime will collapse , but its legitimacy has been totally discredited			0
the closure of the @entity112 in @entity76 is another sign of the sharply deteriorating security situation in @entity2			1
officials said it has become impossible for the embassy to continue operations and for the staff to remain			0
this decision reflects @entity122 's assessment of the regime 's inability to control @entity2 fully			1
with the death toll mounting and the failure of the @entity129 initiative , the @entity2 issue was referred to the @entity130 in an effort to put international pressure on the @entity2 regime to respond positively to the requirements of the @entity129 initiative			1
basically , the initiative was to have the @entity2 regime cease the armed repression of its citizens and have a deputy nominated by @entity3 to engage with the opposition leading toward a political transition			1
however , the @entity130 action was vetoed by @entity142 and @entity143 on saturday			0
both countries have an inherent aversion to @entity130 action that " interferes " in the internal affairs of other states			0
particularly after @entity150 intervention in @entity151 , @entity143 and @entity142 do not want to establish precedents that one day could be applied to potential problems within their own nations			0
the @entity142 @entity130 ambassador 's statement that @entity2 's territorial integrity , sovereignty and independence must be respected reflects @entity142 's own sensitivities in this regard			1
in addition , @entity143 has vested interests in @entity2 in the form of lucrative arms sales , commercial ties and access by its naval fleet to the @entity2 port of @entity170			2
the draft resolution was considerably watered down to try to persuade @entity143 and @entity142 not to vote against it			0
there were no references to authorization of military intervention , an arms embargo , regime change or a human rights commission of inquiry			0
despite these efforts , @entity143 and @entity142 vetoed the draft resolution , leaving the next steps in question			0
the @entity143 foreign minister is to travel to @entity76 to meet with @entity3 , but the purpose of that mission is dubious			2
@entity2 is the linchpin of the @entity189 ; any instability there will almost certainly spill beyond its borders to @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195			2
@entity18 is carefully watching and waiting to see the outcome			0
@entity197 is vulnerable to refugee inflows and internal ethnic tensions given @entity2 's @entity201 population on @entity197 's southern border			2
@entity203 has much to lose from the fall of @entity3 's regime			1
its strategic alliance with @entity2 is at great risk now			2
with a change of regime in @entity76 , it is highly unlikely that a new government , one in which the majority @entity213 population plays a more important role than that under the current dominant @entity219 , will continue the same relationship with the ayatollahs in @entity222			0
@entity223 in @entity193 also has a lot to lose if @entity203 - @entity2 relations no longer allow @entity2 to be an essential center for funneling arms , money and logistical support to it			2
the outcome in @entity2 can not and should not be dictated from outside , but the international community , despite recent setbacks , should work persistently to end the killing and support a political transition representative of the will of the @entity2 people through , ideally , constitutional reforms and elections			1
the ultimate goal is a democratic and pluralistic @entity2 that can be at peace with its own people and that of all its neighbors			2
