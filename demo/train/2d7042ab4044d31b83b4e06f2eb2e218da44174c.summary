@entity13 , @entity14 : it is friday , and it is awesome ! thank you for rounding out your week with @entity0			1
from the @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , i 'm @entity22			2
let 's get to today 's headlines			2
first up : @entity25 @entity26 : first up , president @entity27 heads to @entity28			2
the @entity5 leader wrapping up his visit to @entity4 yesterday			1
the reception he got when he met with congressional leaders on @entity33 , not necessarily a warm one			2
@entity36 and @entity37 leaders raised some of the strong concerns they have about @entity5 's policies on human rights and economic issues			1
it was a different story wednesday night at the @entity44 , when president @entity27 was the guest of honor at a formal state dinner with president @entity47 you see here			0
these are special events , these state dinners , for world leaders when they visit the @entity52			1
the @entity44 had n't hosted one for @entity5 since 1997			1
during his time in @entity4 , president @entity27 talked about @entity5 's role as one of the biggest economic powers in the world			1
some of @entity5 's economic policies are frustrating some officials and companies in the @entity52 , and @entity62 explains why			1
( begin video ) @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity4 : at the @entity44 , the dignified pageantry of a state visit for @entity5 's president , @entity27			1
but just under the surface , smoldering resentment towards the @entity5 in the halls of @entity52 government and business			1
accusations of currency manipulation , unfair barriers to @entity52 businesses in @entity5 , and @entity52 products being copied or ripped off			1
bootlegged dvds of the latest @entity80 releases are sometimes available on @entity5 streets before they even open in @entity52 theaters			1
@entity52 companies developing electronics , prescription drugs and software have similar complaints			1
the @entity5 government even engages in some of this practice , right ? @entity90 , @entity91 : the @entity5 government has laws that protect intellectual property , but in practice , enforcement is very lax			1
and in some cases , @entity5 government agencies , including military agencies , will sometimes rip off the intellectual property themselves			1
@entity100 : @entity90 of the @entity91 says the @entity5 steal @entity52 intellectual property by reverse engineering : buying @entity52 products , figuring out how they 're put together			1
then they make those parts themselves at a cheaper cost			0
then there are complaints about @entity5 's trade rules			1
take a company like @entity111 in @entity112 , where 20 percent of revenue comes from exports			0
@entity116 president @entity115 says he 'd like to export to @entity5 , but the @entity5 have a rule that many products sold to government agencies there , or which get tax breaks , have to be made completely in @entity5			1
known as the " indigenous innovation policy , " it stacks the deck against @entity52 companies like @entity111			1
there 's a direct impact , @entity115 says , on @entity52 jobs			1
@entity128 : for every million dollars in new exports i get , i 'm going to hire about eight more people			0
@entity100 : @entity5 officials say their trade policies are not unfair , and they 're stepping up enforcement of intellectual property laws			1
but the list of @entity52 complaints may prompt action from @entity139 , especially newly empowered @entity37 leaders in the @entity44			1
what are you and other congressional leaders prepared to do to put more pressure on @entity5 to level this playing field ? @entity37 @entity146 , ( r ) @entity147 : we 're going to continue to work , looking at our trade law , what we have to enforce trade agreements			1
we 're going to continue to really pressure @entity5 leaders , whether it 's coming from @entity139 or from the administration , on this indigenous innovation policy and meeting their agreements under the @entity158 , the @entity158 agreements			1
@entity100 : but taking action against @entity5 is not risk free			1
@entity90 of the @entity91 says , as the second biggest economy in the world right now , the @entity5 have a lot of clout , that they can and will retaliate			1
they 'll block @entity52 exports , they 'll reduce their investments in @entity52 securities			1
the @entity5 are @entity52 's biggest banker in the world by far , @entity90 says , and right now , they have a lot of leverage			1
@entity62 , @entity0 , @entity4			1
( @entity172 ) is this legit ? @entity173 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the @entity52 vice president oversees the @entity52 @entity175			1
not true ! that part of @entity139 is overseen by the @entity177			0
health care vote @entity26 : @entity37 @entity179 is currently serving in the role as speaker of the @entity44			1
and earlier this week , he oversaw a @entity44 vote to repeal president @entity47 's controversial health care reform law			1
this law is widely considered to be president @entity47 's biggest @entity52 accomplishment while he was president			1
@entity44 @entity37 are working to come up with some replacement plans for the law			0
but as @entity190 explains , the idea of repealing the existing law altogether might not go any further than it already has			0
( begin video ) @entity192 , @entity65 , @entity4 : it may turn out to be largely symbolic , but @entity44 republicans , along with three @entity36 , voted wednesday to repeal the health care law championed by president @entity47 and @entity36 leaders in @entity139			1
the vote , 245 to 189 , was mostly along party lines			0
it 's the culmination of a campaign promise @entity194 made ahead of the november midterm elections			1
the next step for the newly passed legislation is all but certain : the @entity205 likely wo n't even take it up			0
earlier wednesday , @entity44 majority leader @entity207 challenged his @entity36 counterpart in the @entity205 , majority leader @entity208 , to consider the bill			0
@entity37 @entity207 , ( r ) majority leader : and leader @entity208 continues to say that he is not going to bring this up for a vote in the @entity205			0
the @entity52 people deserve a full hearing			1
they deserve to see this legislation go to the @entity205 for a full vote			0
@entity217 : a new @entity219 poll shows 50 percent of @entity52 favor getting rid of the law			2
but for @entity36 , defending the president 's top domestic achievement is paramount			0
@entity37 @entity223 , ( @entity224 ) @entity225 : i think what is picking up steam is the understanding that this repeal hurts the middle class of this country			2
@entity37 @entity233 , ( @entity234 ) @entity235 : this is not about campaign promises			0
this is about real people experiencing real problems in real time that we need to address			0
@entity217 : most republicans acknowledge that an outright repeal is highly unlikely and will instead focus on finding ways to cut funding for the law			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity190			2
( @entity172 ) @entity249 @entity26 : federal agents carry out a huge raid on suspected @entity249 members and take dozens of people into police custody			0
kinda sounds like something out of a movie , and some of the suspects arrested yesterday probably wish it was			0
officials are calling this one of the biggest , single - day operations against the mafia in @entity263 history			0
more than a hundred people with alleged ties to the mob were arrested across parts of @entity268 , @entity225 , @entity269 and even @entity270			0
the charges include drug trafficking , illegal gambling , extortion , arson and murder			0
some of those charges go back to 1981			0
officials say organized crime -- the mob -- is an ongoing threat , but that yesterday 's raids made a serious dent against that threat			0
@entity285 @entity286 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! which of these terms describes a low - level crime ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) felony , b ) habeus corpus , c ) capital offense or @entity224 ) misdemeanor ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a misdemeanor is a low - level crime			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! ticketing students @entity26 : so , for examples of a misdemeanor : they might include vandalism ; they might include trespassing			2
in parts of @entity6 , you can add disrupting class or using profanity to that list			2
instead of getting sent to the principal 's office , students who act up are issued tickets and could end up in court in some places ! they could face fines of up to $ 500			2
this policy is n't new ; it 's been going on for a while there			0
some parents are n't happy about it			0
they argue that schools and parents -- not the court system -- should help students figure out right from wrong			2
a school district in @entity332 issued a statement saying , " the vast majority of our students are not disruptive			2
those who do receive tickets are hopefully learning that their actions have consequences			2
" promo @entity26 : you know what comes next			0
go to @entity344 and tell us what you think of this story ! our blog is the perfect place for you to sound off on ticketing as a method of discipline			0
and if you do n't like it , tell us what should be done instead			0
also , you should totally introduce our show			0
record your intro , head to @entity344 to send us your @entity359			0
and then , look for our e-mail response that tells you the next step in getting on @entity0			2
it 's easier than you think ! before we go @entity26 : and before we go today , they say beauty is in the eye of the beholder			0
in this guy 's case , his good looks are also at the mercy of the sun. students heading back for the spring semester at @entity374 were greeted by this frosty fellow			2
his eyes are made of coal ; yeah , that 's pretty predictable			0
but the nose is a traffic cone			0
and the hat , well , that 's from the sculpture that this gigantic snowman was built around			0
goodbye @entity26 : it 's a cool idea			0
we just hope no one got confused and thought it was a real person			0
although if they did , you know what we 'd have to tell them : that 's no man ! it 's the kind of story you can always say you thaw on @entity0			2
we 're gon na go chill out			0
we hope you have a great weekend , that you forgive us for those puns , and that you join us on monday , when @entity0 returns			2
