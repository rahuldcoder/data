@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first thing i noticed were the bicycles			1
those who were n't riding them were walking			2
i was beginning to wonder if we 'd taken a wrong turn			2
we were looking for @entity1 's super-secret space center			1
our four - hour drive from @entity0 in @entity1 's west had taken us past picture postcard fields and fish ponds framed by looming snow - capped peaks , through an oasis of green and finally across the arid @entity18 desert			1
read more : spaceship blasts off from @entity18 we had pushed through numerous military checkpoints and past cameras that flashed and took our picture as we sped past the seemingly endless shimmering sand hills			2
there should be no doubt we 'd arrived at the right place , it just did n't feel like it			0
atmosphere ' electric ' if this really was the epicenter of @entity1 's space race , then why did it feel so relaxed ? a few hours later i 'd be in a room crammed with tv cameras and reporters where the atmosphere was electric in a weird sci - fi way			1
but at that moment on those narrow scrubbed and manicured streets it felt almost like a vacation town			1
tiny restaurants pulsed bright inviting neon lights at us as we drove by			0
even the small stores had a come hither and loiter awhile holiday village quality to them			0
our hotel when we arrived was so new gardeners were still planting the flower beds , and builders ' white sheets covered the new red carpet			0
sadly , in this town that claims to offer the ultimate in uplift , space rockets , the elevator was not working			2
the porters however were only too happy to help			0
easy charm indeed , that seems to sum up @entity0 space center as the town is known ; its easy charm and friendliness			1
it 's not until you rub shoulders with the town 's power brokers that you see sense the purpose of this place			2
in one of the low rise buildings , barely visible from the road behind rows of trees i met one such person			0
rather i saw her , than actually met her			0
in a conference room crowded with journalists she strode in on a mission			0
no sense of holiday about her , she oozes work			0
as deputy director of the space mission that means she has the hopes of the nation riding on her shoulders			2
little wonder everyone in the room paid attention to her words			0
every question that came about the imminent launch of @entity1 's next manned mission to space she answered in precise , accurate and minute detail			1
well , almost every question			0
for no matter how much i waved my hand and waited my turn , it never came			0
space race i suppose , after all , this is a @entity1 event and why would they want to answer a question from the only @entity114 reporter they 'd invited to the launch ? but space race , yes , i caught a whiff of it right there			1
before the @entity121 rocket topped by the @entity123 space capsule does take off on tuesday , i am told i will get to the launch pad			1
no doubt i 'll catch the urgency right there			0
@entity1 has taken great strides since its first manned space mission 10 years ago but it still lags the @entity130 and @entity131 , who share the permanently manned international space station			1
everyone will be wishing the @entity1 mission luck as they thrust into the skies on the quest to help future generations			1
the blue spacesuited heroes i saw will spend 15 days orbiting the earth after docking with their own unmanned space station			2
while by comparison , @entity145 's @entity144 craft docks with the @entity146 just six hours after liftoff , the @entity1 will take two days from takeoff to docking			1
but six hours or two days ; it does n't really matter			0
@entity1 is in space and the people of this town fully understand what that achievement means .			1

@entity2 's @entity158 is the only @entity114 *correspondent* invited to @entity1 's *scheduled* rocket launch
in @entity1 's super-secret space city he finds a relaxed vacation vibe
*locals* ride cycles and charm you with friendliness
but behind the relaxed *facade* is a fierce *ambition* taking @entity1 into space
