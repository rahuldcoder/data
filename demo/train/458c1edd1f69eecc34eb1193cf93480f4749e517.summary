@entity0 -- @entity2 calls his daughter , @entity3 , " my sparkle			2
" he says " she 's everything for me , she 's phenomenal , she 's my life			2
" @entity7 says the 5 - year - old is " quite happy " living life with her as the custodial parent			2
what the estranged couple has to say about each other is not so cordial			2
their custody fight is many ways a typical " he - said , she - said " dispute , but because it has been waged across international borders , the @entity21 @entity20 is now involved			1
the case of @entity2 v. @entity7 will be heard by the justices on wednesday and an eventual ruling could establish an important precedent on the discretion of @entity21 courts to decide where children caught in parental fights should stay			1
in the middle is @entity3 , the girl who lives in @entity32 with her mother			1
her dad is an @entity35 sergeant based at @entity36 , @entity37			1
a federal court said under international treaty , @entity3 should remain overseas since it was her " habitual residence			1
" that court also said the custody issue was moot since the girl was already overseas			1
@entity44 eventually asked the justices to intervene on his behalf			2
" i do n't believe that ( the current legal fight ) is in the best interest of the child as it 's going to go on for years and years to come , " @entity47 told @entity1			2
@entity44 wants to revive his claim of @entity3 ' custody , arguing the child 's normal place of residence is the @entity21			1
" i told my little girl i would do everything i could to get her , " he told @entity1 national correspondent @entity56 , " to make sure she 's safe			1
" he last visited his daughter overseas in july			2
the couple met in 2006 in @entity62 , where @entity44 was stationed			2
@entity3 was born there the following year			2
it was while the father was deployed to @entity66 for 15 months that the personal and legal troubles escalated			1
@entity7 claims it was agreed she would stay with the child in @entity32 as the de facto " habitual residence " while @entity44 served in combat			1
@entity21 courts later established that residency to conclude the child belonged with her mother			1
" this is the heart of this treaty			1
the whole treaty turns on these two words -- ' habitual residence			1
' what is the ordinary , regular home of this little girl ? " said @entity82 , @entity47 's attorney			1
" it has to be @entity32 because the last time they ever agreed on anything was their agreement that @entity32 was the child 's home			1
" upon @entity44 's return from @entity66 to @entity62 , the couple separated , then made various attempts at reconciliation			0
he was transferred to @entity96 , @entity97 , and @entity7 soon followed with @entity3			0
but the domestic situation did not improve and the custody fights eventually played out there			1
@entity44 and his supporters say the child was happy in the @entity21 , " fully engaged and immersed in her @entity21 community			0
" more importantly from a legal perspective , his lawyers argue his wife was fully committed to staying in the @entity21 as a resident			0
but the relationship deteriorated and divorce proceedings began			0
@entity47 said she wanted to leave with their daughter			0
that 's when she said her husband called the police			0
" i was removed from the house			0
i was taken to jail , " she said			0
when police checked her status on a tourist visa , " an immigration officer came out to see me			0
and he advised me that because my green card was still in the process , that i was actually there illegally and i would be deported			0
" it was after @entity47 was sent out of the country without her daughter that she filed a " @entity131 of child to @entity32 " under the 1980 @entity130 's @entity129			1
it grants parents in general a " right of custody " and a separate " right of access , " ensuring the laws of one country are respected in the others			1
more than 80 nations are a party to the treaty , including the @entity21 and the @entity144			1
@entity47 did not see @entity3 for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in @entity97			1
she was allowed to return to the @entity21 on a special visa just long enough to have a federal judge rule in her favor , allowing her to take @entity3 back to @entity32 where they remain			1
" i would like the @entity20 to say that my case is moot , " she said from her home			1
" if they do n't , if they rule in my husband 's favor and he is allowed to appeal then this is going to go on for years which is ludicrous			0
none of us will be able to move on with our lives , we 're stuck in this constant state of appeals , appeals , appeals			0
" but @entity44 and his lawyers say the federal courts are at odds over what judges can and can not do over the " habitual residence " question			0
they say in this case the full appeals process was not allowed to continue , denying the father his due process rights			1
" the phrase miscarriage of justice comes to mind , " said @entity179 , the father 's attorney			1
" the other side 's position is once a child leaves the boundaries of the @entity21 , it 's over			0
there is nothing you can do about it			0
and that has terrifying consequences			0
" justice @entity195 has unusual experience with this issue			0
as a federal judge on the 2nd @entity21 @entity199 , she dissented from a decision that she said too narrowly interpreted the impact of a custody order			1
she wrote in 2000 that the @entity130 must have power to enforce a custody order that " by its very nature limits each parent 's unilateral decision - making power , including his or her power to relocate to another country with the child			1
" in an unrelated 2010 high court case , @entity195 succinctly summarized the delicate balancing courts around the world must maintain			2
" the purpose of the convention is , which court will decide the life of that child , " she said			0
" and to avoid , as i understood the convention structure , this flight from court to court and this long , drawn - out process from country to country over who 's going to make that choice			0
" both sides agree clarity on the issue is needed , if not for them , then for other parents in similar situations			0
" ultimately what 's at the heart of the treaty is the welfare of the child , " said @entity82			2
" and it 's not good for a child to be like a ping pong ball going backwards and forwards between different countries			0
and that 's why the treaty solves a problem			2
" as for the @entity247 -- still technically married but apparently never again to be husband and wife -- both share a measure of regret over their broken union and a child caught in the middle , as well as anxiety over what the high court will do			0
" i believe that if my daughter 's returned to the @entity21 , i will never see her again , " said @entity47 , who said this fight is about @entity3 ' future and well - being			0
" i 'm going as far as i can			0
until i humanly , possibly can not go any further , i will not stop fighting for my daughter			0
" the case is @entity7 v. @entity2 ( 11 - 1347 )			2
a ruling is expected by the spring			2
@entity1 's @entity56 and @entity265 contributed to this report .			0
