at one point in the 2012 presidential campaign , each of @entity3 's tweets had to be approved by nearly two dozen aides in the lead - up to the @entity9 's loss to president @entity10 , a new study says			1
the figure is included in a @entity13 study published friday			0
the study cites @entity15 , @entity3 's digital integration director , who says that each post -- on @entity18 , @entity19 , the campaign 's blog or elsewhere -- had to be approved by an ever - growing roster of the campaign 's operatives			1
" towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it			0
... the digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them			0
... the downfall of that of course is as fast as we are moving it can take a little bit of time to get that approval to happen , " she says			0
@entity3 's digital director , @entity41 , concurred , saying the campaign had " the best tweets ever written by 17 people ... it was the best they all could agree on every single time			1
" that enough @entity3 aides to play a football game had to approve each tweet underscores major differences in approaches between @entity10 's digitally - savvy campaign and the clunkier operations it defeated -- including @entity55 in the 2008 @entity57 primary and @entity3 in 2012			2
the study 's author is @entity60 , an assistant professor at the @entity13 who researches political communication			0
he wrote that " in contrast to the @entity10 campaign , @entity3 's digital team had to go through an extensive vetting process for all of its public communications , meaning that the temporal workflow of the campaign did not match the speed of social media			1
" @entity60 wrote that the @entity3 campaign 's digital team felt undermined by its lack of autonomy			2
by the campaign 's conclusion , he wrote , @entity3 staffers were repackaging press releases for use on social media because they knew that language had already been green - lighted .			2
