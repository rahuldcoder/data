@entity0 , @entity1 -- a humanitarian land convoy heading to @entity4 from @entity5 reached @entity0 , @entity1 on the @entity6 wednesday and is destined to become the first relief mission to @entity4 from @entity5			1
" i was inspired last year by the convoys that went to @entity4 from @entity10 , so we asked ourselves ; why not from @entity5 ? " said @entity12 of the @entity13 ( @entity13 )			1
after eight months of preparation , the land convoy which consists of ten trucks , explained @entity12 , departed @entity17 , @entity5 on june 26 and has passed through seven countries thus far including @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity1			1
it is to unload its shipment of humanitarian aid in @entity0 on ships that will head to @entity30 , @entity31 where members of the convoy will receive their trucks after flying to @entity31 from @entity1			1
the convoy has received the support of several @entity5 leaders including bishop @entity37 who said in a @entity39 video message : " i want to congratulate @entity13 and wish them well			1
you are helping to do @entity42 's work ; @entity42 bless you			0
" @entity4 has been under a land , sea and air blockade by @entity46 since 2007			2
@entity46 authorities say the blockade is to limit rocket attacks fired from @entity4 and to prevent @entity51 authorities who govern the @entity4 from obtaining weapons and funds			2
@entity31 authorities had maintained a blockade on @entity4 from 2007 to 2011			1
last may , @entity58 under - secretary general for @entity59 and @entity61 @entity60 said that the blockade of @entity4 has resulted in a stifling of economic activity and a serious decline in education , health care and water and sanitation services			2
the @entity5 to @entity71 's mission follows recent attempts by @entity10 and @entity74 ships to reach @entity4 as part of a coalition known as @entity77 but were blocked from doing so			1
they include the @entity74 ship @entity81 flotilla that was prevented by @entity83 authorities from sailing to @entity4 from @entity85 and the @entity87 ship @entity88 that was intercepted by an @entity46 naval ship			2
last year , @entity46 commandos prevented the @entity91 from reaching @entity4 from @entity92 and bordered the ship @entity93			2
the raid on the ship led to the death of nine @entity92 activists			0
" we are a peaceful convoy on an aid mission , " affirms @entity12			0
" we ca n't predict what is going to happen , we know there 's pressure on the @entity31 government , but you never know			0
" according to @entity106 , the @entity31 government has not allowed the convoy to drive on @entity31 land and has requested they go straight via sea from @entity0 to @entity109 near the @entity31 - @entity4 border			1
" [ but ] the ships from @entity0 can only go to @entity30 , so we are trying to solve this problem , " he says			0
the trip from @entity5 to @entity1 has had its challenges , @entity12 explains			0
" we were delayed at some borders for no clear reasons and some of the roads were very bad , " he says			0
" we got to a place between @entity21 and @entity22 that was full of pot holes ; i think if one of the trucks had fallen into one you would 've needed a crane to take it out			0
" the convoy 's shipment , @entity106 continues , is carrying aid to the people of @entity4 including " one hundred and twenty two generators , diapers for the elderly and children , cloths , stationery , and we intend to buy medicine in @entity31			1
" @entity139 , 46 , an architect and member of the convoy says " after the last @entity142 , the images i saw , of legs being amputated without anesthesia , for me , that was it , i do n't ' know the details , but i know a wrong is being done			0
" @entity139 , a granddaughter of @entity5 @entity148 activists , continued : " as a @entity5 and after what we went through and coming out of that and having the support of the world , and as a @entity154 , i had to take a stand			0
