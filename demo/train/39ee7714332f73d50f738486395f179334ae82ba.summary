-- most people are carrying around historical records in their dna , with clues to how people from genetically distinct groups intermingled over the last 4,000 years			1
that 's the conclusion of a new study in the journal @entity10			0
researchers set out to pinpoint which groups intermixed , and when , over thousands of years , using modern dna			1
they thought this information could complement other historical records			2
" the results suggest @entity3 is indeed a powerful means of reconstructing history , which then might be used to identify the genetic legacies of historically well - attested events ... and highlight surprising events with a less clear historical context , " authors @entity15 and @entity17 wrote in an e-mail			1
the scientists have created an interactive map showcasing their findings			0
you can explore the map in detail on the researchers ' website , admixturemap.paintmychromosomes.com			2
the technical term for people from genetically different groups having babies together is " genetic admixture			1
" this has happened throughout history when people migrated into a new geographic region where others were already living			2
researchers say there have been many such admixture events among people from populations that were separated by thousands of miles			1
sometimes populations adjacent to each other have distinct ancestry and history			0
did you know that your @entity3 contains genetic segments you 've inherited from groups that intermingled in the past ? researchers can look at these signatures for clues about major historical mixings of populations			1
dna from a person today can also give scientists an idea of how long ago two groups genetically mixed			2
the more time that has passed since the admixture event , the shorter the inherited dna segments from the original groups are likely to be			2
that 's because there would have been more generations in between , and there would have been reshuffling of genetic material in each generation			0
there are limitations to the method , however			0
when genetic mixing involves more than three groups , the researchers ca n't identify those specific events			1
the researchers were also limited in how well they could estimate when the same , or very similar , groups interbred on multiple occasions in one descendant group 's history			1
oldest human dna found in @entity91 the researchers looked at a genetic data set of 1,490 people who come from 95 genetically distinct groups worldwide			1
their software , @entity97 , was able to describe genetic mixing events dating back about 4,500 years			1
the expansion of the @entity100 , which took place from 1206 to 1368 , appears to have been highly influential on many populations in @entity103 and @entity104			0
previous studies have also supported that idea			0
@entity107 and his armies began this monumental historical event that influenced seven populations included in this study			0
the @entity113 expansion and slave trade , which began around the seventh century , also had a large genetic impact on many groups , including people from around the @entity118 , the @entity119 and the @entity120			1
the study 's findings are consistent with that historical timeframe , but suggest that @entity124 and @entity125 mixed earlier			0
a group called the @entity127 , from @entity128 , appears to come from an admixture event that happened sometime before 206 b.c. , when people from a more @entity103 group hooked up with a more @entity133 group			0
researchers say the @entity127 are geographically isolated , originating in the @entity136 mountains , which is why they do n't show genetic signatures of a more recent admixture event			2
local tradition says the @entity127 are descended from the army of @entity142 ; the new study does not rule that out , since the time period of the mixing event could have been about right			0
" we have tried to let the genetic information ' speak ' in this study , but future interpretation of signals -- especially in follow - up studies of specific regions -- would benefit from expertise from ... historians , linguists and others , " @entity15 and @entity17 said			0
some groups showed genetic signals that the researchers were unable to precisely interpret			1
for instance , genetic material from @entity164 people suggests an intermixing between northern and southern @entity103 and northern @entity124 , between 785 and 1,385 years ago , but the event itself is still unclear			2
the researchers were not able to pick up signals of some well - established historical intermixings , such as migrations into the @entity173 from northern @entity103 groups , because of the small sample sizes			1
it is possible that a mutation could arise in two populations independently , but that is thought to be rare			0
" if two individuals share a mutation , it is statistically much more likely that the mutation occurred in a common ancestor of both individuals , rather than arising independently in the ancestors of each of them , " @entity15 and @entity17 said			0
the researchers are involved in a project called people of the @entity190 , which is looking specifically at the genetic origins of people from the @entity173			1
other projects are looking in more depth at areas such as the @entity196 , @entity197 and the @entity198			0
the researchers say in the study that as whole - genome sequencing improves and analyses are able to incorporate more people as well as ancient dna , we may reach a " better understanding of ancient events where little or no historical record exists , to identify many additional events ... and to provide more precise event characterization than is currently possible			1
" there may also be implications for public health , as researchers get better at identifying disease risks that are higher in specific populations			0
