-- one of the most memorable @entity2 ads in recent years starred a pint - size @entity3 attempting to use the force all over his house , finally succeeding , or so he thought , in starting his dad 's car			1
these days the boy behind the @entity3 mask is strictly using his force for good			1
@entity11 , the 8 - year - old actor who stole audience 's hearts in the 2011 @entity15 ad , was born with a rare congenital heart defect and has undergone eight surgeries , most recently last summer			1
but his medical problems have n't dampened his spirit			0
as head of the @entity21 for @entity22 , @entity11 has dedicated much of his young life to raising awareness and funds for other kids in need			1
or as he says , " it 's the first time @entity3 's been good , so that might be a little change			1
" @entity11 had his first surgery at 3 months old after being diagnosed with @entity32			1
the congenital heart defect , which changes the normal flow of blood through the heart , occurs in about five out of every 10,000 babies , according to the @entity38			1
@entity11 's charitable efforts began almost as soon as his medical troubles did			1
by the time of his first birthday , he had already endured four surgeries			1
his parents , @entity45 and @entity46 , said they felt grateful to the families who came before them and others who donated to keep the @entity51 hospital and neonatal intensive care unit open			0
" we feel a tremendous responsibility to make sure the doors stay open for us and families that follow us and to do our part , " @entity53 says			0
every year , @entity11 and his younger brother @entity59 , 7 , pick a charity and ask for donations in place of presents for either of them			1
" we 've raised over $ 50,000 over the years for charity causes of all kinds			0
now everyone looks forward to what the boys are going to do , " @entity53 says			0
@entity11 's fame from the @entity2 ad has widened the family 's reach and strengthened his impact			1
" hopefully , i can just use my force for even better good , and i hope that it works , " he says			2
the vivacious youngster regularly speaks and campaigns for @entity22 as well as smaller organizations such as @entity81 in @entity82			2
@entity11 also visits children in the hospital and has become something of a role model			2
he takes his responsibility seriously since he also looks up to someone -- snowboarder @entity88			0
he has yet to meet the @entity90 gold medalist , but he says he will have a lot of questions when he does			0
his mom watched @entity88 compete in the @entity90 the same year @entity11 was first diagnosed , and after hearing from doctors about the limitations her son would face , she says she found hope in @entity88 , who has the same heart defect			1
" i remember watching , and the significance for me was that @entity11 could have energy			2
we could actually focus on hope that @entity11 could have energy , and it was actually possible , " she says			2
she adds , " i looked at what his ( @entity88 's ) parents must have had to do to let him live so free			0
because i just want to wrap @entity11 up in bubble wrap and not let anything touch him			2
@entity88 's parents said go for it " it 's been seven months since @entity11 's last surgery -- an open heart pulmonary valve replacement -- and he has been cleared for all activities by his doctors			1
he 's back campaigning for the hospital , and he 's learned to snowboard and also plays @entity124			0
soon he 'll even return to his role on the @entity127 soap " @entity128			0
" in his own words , " i 'm back to being me			0
" his mother says that she and his father try to lead by example but attributes much of the boy 's positive attitude to @entity11 himself			1
" there 's just this innateness in him that says i 'm going to fight , i 'm going to conquer it , i 'm going to win			0
from the very beginning , he 's had to fight			0
from his very first breath , he 's had to fight hard for every breath , and ... i think that is just part of his nature			0
" while he was the breakout star of a previous @entity2 , this year @entity11 will be watching the game at home with his family			1
he says he 's a bit overwhelmed with his two favorite teams competing against each other			0
" i 'll win and i 'll lose			0
so i 'm not going to root for anyone , " @entity11 says			2
" i 'm just going to hope it 's a good match			2
