across the @entity3 , conservatives gathered in chicken restaurants to show support for the company after its president , @entity7 , came out against gay marriage			1
@entity10 mayors in @entity11 and @entity12 at first threatened to halt expansion of the @entity15 chain to their cities , which turned a question of sexual morality into a debate about freedom of speech			1
the motto of conservative @entity22 seems to be , " they 'll take my chicken from my cold dead hand ... " writing as a @entity28 , this story combines two of the things we most readily associate with @entity3 : @entity32 and fast food			1
it certainly reflects a uniquely @entity3 phenomenon			1
there are religious businesspeople and raging conservatives in other parts of the world , but only the @entity3 enjoys all the elements that could turn a statement of conscience into nationwide movement			1
where else in the world would a ) the president of a chicken restaurant chain feel it was within his remit to publicly endorse " the traditional family , " b ) liberal mayors totally overreact by trying to stop his business ' expansion , c ) a former presidential candidate declare an " appreciation day " for the restaurant , and d ) hundreds of people actually show up to eat there in solidarity ? opinion : @entity15 and free speech the whole scenario seems so preposterous as to be contrived , which makes me wonder if it was a brilliant sales gimmick			1
yet , we have no reason to doubt the strength of @entity71 's faith and , after all , @entity15 is n't the only company with a taste for @entity22 witness			1
@entity75 , chairman of @entity76 , discusses his faith on his company 's website and offers advice on prayer			0
in - @entity83 prints " @entity84 " on the bottom of its paper cups			2
@entity88 says it is committed to " honoring the lord " and closes all its stores on a sunday			0
are there other corporations out there with a hidden religious agenda that we all missed because we were n't looking for it ? is @entity96 the acceptable face of @entity98 ? that this story revolves around a chicken restaurant might incline us to be skeptical about its political significance			0
but do n't forget that the tea party started with a trading floor rant and was initially lampooned for its innocent association with the tea bag			0
in @entity3 , businesses have often been the battlegrounds for political conflicts , think of the civil rights movement 's lunch counter sit - ins			1
time will only tell whether or not this is an important moment in the revival of conservative religious activism			0
however , it does offer two immediate warnings about the november election			0
opinion : the right way and the wrong way to protest @entity15 first , culture will matter			1
there 's always a tendency to presume that in presidential elections " it 's the economy stupid			2
" the polls confirm that voters still place moral questions very low on their list of priorities			0
but cultural issues keep on coming up in ways that we did n't expect : contraception in february , gay marriage in may , guns in july , and now we 're back to gay marriage			0
it could be that bad jobs reports are so common that they 've become the background noise of the campaign , while the matters related to sex and violence compete more colorfully for our attention			0
but no , something more complex is taking place : @entity148 and culture are becoming synonymous			2
news : @entity151 ends five decade relationship with @entity15 over gay marriage stance in rallying to @entity71 's defense , some conservatives have pointed out that his company has created jobs and that attempts to block its growth are bad for middle - class @entity3			1
they made the same case against @entity163 's war on supersized drinks			0
there 's a theme to the complaints emerging : that in their pursuit of liberal ends the @entity10 are costing jobs , while patriotic conservatives like @entity71 are repairing the economy and spreading the gospel			0
@entity175 is now running billboard ads that lampoon @entity178 's claim that businesses need government support to flourish			1
the implicit choice that the right is trying to establish is " hardworking , self - reliant @entity22 businessmen " vs " welfare - supporting , anti-growth , atheistic bureaucrats			2
" hence , debates that can seem only to be about culture can actually become a way of discussing who is to blame for our economic woes			1
second , the sheer number of people involved in the @entity1 suggests that turnout will matter in november			2
a common theme among tweets coming out of the restaurant demonstrations wednesday was that conservative strength lies in numbers			0
one photo caption read , " hey liberals , the turnout for @entity15 - a appreciation day is a preview of the polling stations in november			1
" maybe , maybe not			0
but the polls are close and the number of undecided voters is falling			0
@entity3 is settling down into two , surprisingly partisan , camps of voters who probably wo n't change their minds significantly until voting day			1
if that pattern holds , then turnout is all important			2
in 2004 , the ability of the @entity215 team to get out their religious vote swung them a relatively close election			0
if @entity175 can effectively establish the link between economics and culture , and then motivate conservatives to turn out in big numbers , then the @entity15 - a moment could prove prophetic			1

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity229 : @entity15 - a dustup so preposterous it almost seems a brilliant sales gimmick
he says @entity3 has odd tendency to turn statements of *principle* into a nationwide movement
he says it might be *pre-election* warning : culture wars can be blended with economic *worries*
@entity229 : @entity245 could preview voter turnout if @entity175 plays it right
