-- @entity3 , dramatist and novelist , @entity2 's work has left a large imprint on the literary landscape of @entity7			1
@entity9 activist and @entity10 , @entity2			2
his work has been performed internationally and in 1986 was awarded the @entity12			1
regardless of the global profile and recognition , writing for @entity2 has always been , and always will be , a part of his life			2
" i began writing early , very , very early			2
... i was already writing short stories for the radio , and selling poems to poetry and art festivals , i was involved in school plays , i wrote essays , so there was no definite moment when i said , now i 'm a writer			1
i 've always been a writer , " he told @entity0			1
before being honored with a @entity28 , @entity2 had written plays performed across the world , set up drama groups and held academic positions in the @entity33 , the @entity34 and @entity35			1
poetry and novels make up the rest of his work , but it is with the medium of drama that he feels most comfortable			0
" when i write plays , i 'm already seeing the shapes on stage , of the actors and their interaction , and so on and so forth			2
i do n't think i 've ever written one play as an abstract piece , as a literary piece , floating in the air somewhere , to be flushed out later on , " he said			1
now 75 , @entity2 claims it is a natural curiosity with life and humanity that has always compelled him to write , and should be a pre-requisite for all aspiring writers			0
" before you 're a writer , you 're a citizen , a human being , and therefore the weapons of the citizen are at your disposal to use , or not use , " he said			0
often he 's used those " weapons " to take aim at oppression , corruption , the legacy of colonialism and slavery , both in his work and more overtly in his political activism			0
at times he 's suffered for his outspoken views ; in 1967 he was imprisoned for 22 months for publicly calling for a truce during @entity35 's civil war and in 1994 was forced to leave the country when general @entity73 came to power			1
" one of my earliest short stories in fact had to do with the story of a family which escaped enslavement by @entity83 slave leaders , so you can see how early i was preoccupied by that theme of power and freedom , and domination , " he said			0
" if there 's one overriding political theme it 's my continuing emphasis on the axis of freedom and power			0
i think that the history of the world , of all societies , has spun on those two axes			0
" @entity2 spends his time between @entity35 , @entity98 and the @entity34 , much of it on the lecture circuit , but the need to write remains			1
" i 've always written plays for the purpose of getting something out of my system			1
that 's the first stage			0
and the next stage is , i want to get it onto the platform -- onto the stage			0
and once i 've done that , no matter where , i 'm satisfied			2
