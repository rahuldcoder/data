@entity0 -- for @entity3 , an evenly divided @entity2 would be a bfd			1
if tuesday 's midterm elections result in a @entity2 split , the vice president will suddenly find himself in one of his favorite places : the spotlight			1
@entity3 would become a crucial player in the @entity2 , providing the tie - breaking vote on key bills and keeping the chamber in @entity15 hands for the twilight years of president @entity17 's administration			1
for a politician who spent 36 years in the @entity2 and has run into trouble conforming to the constraints of being @entity17 's no. 2 , a divide could be a welcome twist to a career that has often confounded expectations			1
" clearly , he is a creature of the @entity2 , " said @entity25 , @entity3 's former chief of staff who filled in as @entity27 senator when his boss became vice president			1
" i ca n't think of a better person to be in that position			0
i know he would relish it			0
" it 's rare for an election to result in an even split in the 100 - seat @entity2 , turning control over to the vice president 's party			1
the last time that happened was after the 2000 election , when @entity43 's role as a tiebreaker solidified a @entity46 majority			0
that only continued for a few months before a moderate @entity46 switched parties and gave @entity15 full control of the @entity2			1
this year , the @entity46 needs to post a net gain of six seats to control the chamber and @entity46 appear to be on track to do that			0
but their efforts are being muddied by the enduring strength of @entity15 candidates in @entity58 and @entity59 , who are within striking distance of claiming @entity46 seats -- raising the potential of a split @entity2			1
@entity3 on standby and even if one party wins a slim majority , @entity3 could find himself on standby for much of the next two years			2
deaths or absences among members -- and the possibility that several independents could switch parties and scramble the @entity2 's partisan math -- will raise the odds that @entity3 may be called upon			1
@entity3 's role would mostly be limited to casting tie - breaking votes -- not delving into the nitty gritty of legislating			1
and , of course , tie - breaking votes might be rare in a @entity2 where most bills now require 60 votes to proceed			2
but any additional time in the @entity2 would play to @entity3 's strengths			1
few men in history have adored the clubby chamber as much as @entity3 and he relishes opportunities to cut deals			2
" the @entity2 has been my life — and that is not hyperbole , " @entity3 said in his farewell address , summing up a career of melodramatic confirmation hearings , personal tragedy , health scares and failed presidential campaigns			1
" it literally has been my life			0
" given his affinity for the @entity2 , it must gall @entity3 that he is among only 12 of 47 vice presidents not to have cast one of the 244 tie breaking votes , according to @entity2 historians			1
still , as vice president , he has played a crucial role in getting the administration and @entity2 @entity46 out of jams , orchestrating agreements to raise the debt ceiling and avert the fiscal cliff			1
an expanded role in the @entity2 could also come in handy for @entity3 if he decides to launch a long - shot bid for the @entity112 in 2016			1
of course , there are potential downsides			0
@entity3 slip - ups if he decides to run for president , he could be forced to take uncomfortable votes that would n't play well on the campaign trail			1
and a larger gig in the @entity2 could only provide another venue for his legendary slip - ups , which provide endless fodder for the media and plenty of headaches for the @entity112			2
he has been on a roll lately — recently apologizing to key @entity128 allies for blaming them for the rise of @entity131			0
in october , @entity3 quipped that the vice presidency was a " b — ch of a job , weeks after angering @entity136 groups by using the term " shylocks " and calling @entity139 the " @entity140			2
" once , in @entity27 , he joked you could n't go to a @entity142 unless you had a " slight @entity144 accent			0
" in a private meeting with black clergy in @entity147 , @entity3 referred to himself as " the only white boy on the east side of @entity150 " as he recalled his days as a @entity27 public defender			2
touring global hot spots on @entity153 , @entity3 sometimes baffles foreign leaders with his break - the - ice line : " if i had hair like yours i 'd be president by now			2
" he chatted up grandmas at a @entity2 swearing in ceremony and told @entity162 's family to " spread your legs , you 're gon na be frisked			2
" and in his most famous faux pas , @entity3 was caught at the @entity112 on a hot mic telling @entity17 that passing health care reform was a " big f — — g deal			2
@entity3 's tongue has sometimes irked the @entity171			0
in 2012 , for instance , he trashed @entity17 's plans to roll out his backing for gay marriage by committing the cardinal vice presidential sin on " @entity177 " of getting ahead of the boss			0
@entity17 's confidence but @entity112 insiders say @entity17 values @entity3 's loyalty and owes him one for steadying the re-election campaign after his own first disastrous debate with @entity184			0
vice presidential scholar @entity185 said @entity3 's influence can be measured in how often @entity17 reaches into his inner circle for staffers , notably @entity189 , @entity190 and new ebola czar @entity191			0
" on the one hand , people have this perception of him as an undisciplined guy because he says things that are viewed as gaffes			0
but on the other hand to have functioned in the way that he has shows a tremendous amount of discipline			0
" @entity3 has been in on every big national security decision , masterminded the withdrawal from @entity205 , been a skeptic on military force , managed stimulus spending and gets hours of face time with the president			0
he has grabbed important national security portfolios including @entity212 and mentoring @entity214 's new government			0
but former secretary of defense @entity215 wrote that though it was impossible not to like @entity3 , he had been " wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades			0
" despite his outsized persona , @entity3 would likely be welcomed back to the @entity2 warmly even with his eccentricities , according to veteran journalist @entity221 , who wrote the vice president 's biography			1
some members " thought he talked too much and put his foot in his mouth " and some @entity46 view him as " a bit of a loose cannon			0

@entity3 could play a key role in an evenly divided @entity2
@entity3 would keep an evenly divided @entity2 in @entity15 hands
