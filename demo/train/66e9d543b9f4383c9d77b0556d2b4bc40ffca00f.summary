@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was freezing , wet and a busy travel day before a holiday , but a few dozen protesters showed up outside police headquarters in @entity0 on wednesday night			1
standing underneath a " @entity11 " sign stretching over the road , the demonstrators fired obscenities at @entity14 members who stood on watch outside the police department 's offices			1
the mood was much calmer than the two nights since a grand jury decided not to indict @entity0 police officer @entity21 , but still there was tension in the protest			1
a one - mile stretch of @entity26 , the site of previous protests , was closed to cars and pedestrians , with authorities saying the burned out buildings on the route are crime scenes			0
one of those buildings is @entity34 , of which @entity35 is a member			0
the @entity37 is leading the investigation into the fire that destroyed the church , a spokesman said			1
investigators have found that someone broke into the church and the fire began in a foyer near the doors that were breached , the @entity37 spokesman said			1
the church is some distance away from the strip of stores that burned monday			1
other structures nearby were untouched , which is cause for suspicion , the spokesman said			0
also wednesday , @entity0 police were looking for clues as to who stole an @entity54 that was locked in a rack plucked from a police car that was torched by rioters this week			1
" they took the entire rack from the car , " @entity59 sgt. @entity58 said			1
better night but not without ugliness as @entity0 residents looked around on wednesday morning , they did n't see the kind of damage inflicted on the city a day earlier			1
there were fewer arrests and fewer instances of vandalism tuesday night than the night before			2
and while there was plenty of anger among residents , it was channeled in chants and not chaos			0
" we were perhaps not optimistic , but we were at least hopeful we would have a better night , " said @entity80 police chief @entity79			2
there were ugly incidents , though			0
some rowdy protesters flipped over a police cruiser briefly , broke out its windows and set it on fire			1
police moved in quickly to snuff it out			2
the acrid smell of pepper spray filled the air			0
elsewhere , vandals broke windows and trashed businesses			2
@entity80 police said protesters hurled bottles of " what appears to be urine " at them			1
a car was set ablaze at a parking lot near @entity35 's memorial -- which still stands where the unarmed teen was killed on august 9 -- but sporadic gunfire in the area stopped officers from responding , @entity79 said			1
officers said they seized a @entity113 cocktail and made 44 arrests -- far fewer than monday night , when anger and dismay over a grand jury 's decision not to indict a white police officer in @entity35 's killing led to violence authorities say surpassed the tumult that erupted after the shooting itself			1
" a day before , we were kind of on different pages , " @entity126 capt. @entity125 said			0
" but what i 'm hearing from this community is that we are all on the same page to make our community whole and make sure it stays whole			1
" complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity0 @entity136 protests as in @entity0 , outrage over the grand jury 's decision escalated from coast to coast , with protests in at least 130 cities nationwide			1
from @entity143 to @entity144 and dozens of cities in between , protesters flooded the streets to denounce the grand jury 's decision			1
some demonstrations blocked bridges , tunnels and major highways , but the protests were largely peaceful			0
" they have given us no justice ! we will give them no peace , " protesters chanted as they massed in front of the @entity159 shopping mall			2
in the @entity143 area , demonstrators briefly blocked one of the entrances to the @entity166			0
" we are on the side of @entity35 to fight for what is right , " the rev. @entity167 said			0
" we may have lost round one , but the fight is not over			0
" @entity21 speaks out meanwhile , in his first interview since the fatal shooting , @entity21 maintained that he killed @entity35 , 18 , out of fear for his life during their encounter			0
in the interview with @entity178 , he said his response had nothing to do with race			0
" i know i did my job right , " he said			0
repeating what he told the grand jury , @entity21 said @entity35 reached into his police vehicle and grabbed for his gun			2
" i just felt the immense power that he had			0
and then the way i 've described it is , it was like a 5 - year - old holding onto @entity191			0
that 's just how big this man was , " @entity21 said			2
" he was very large , very powerful man			0
" avoiding a repeat back in @entity0 , authorities were determined tuesday to prevent a repeat of monday night 's violence			1
@entity1 gov. @entity198 ordered additional @entity14 troops to the area , boosting their numbers from 700 to 2,200			0
" we are not your enemy , " protesters chanted at officers who stood in full riot gear			2
" we just want justice			0
" cleaning up earlier tuesday , volunteers helped clean up vandalized stores and eateries and boarded up broken windows and doors			1
some residents carried guns and said volunteers were protecting houses on the streets off @entity218			0
armed men carrying semi-automatic rifles paced the roof of @entity222 , a store that was badly damaged in monday 's protests			1
also tuesday , @entity59 police identified a man who was found shot to death and set on fire			1
@entity79 told the @entity229 newspaper that he is n't discounting the possibility that the death was linked to monday night 's violence			1
@entity233 , 20 , was found behind the wheel of a @entity235 in a parking lot , just down the street from @entity238 , near where @entity35 was killed			0
@entity233 had been shot in the head , police said			2
an accelerant was used to set him on fire , but the fire went out on its own , police said			2
he had burns to his arm , fingers and both legs			0
