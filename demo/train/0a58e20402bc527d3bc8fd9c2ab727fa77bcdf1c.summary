-- with a first name that means " wave " in @entity4 , perhaps @entity1 was destined to pursue a career in water sports			1
and for a self - confessed " mermaid , " synchronized swimming provides the ideal escape			1
" i do n't know why but the water , for me , it 's perfect			2
i feel better inside the water than outside , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity14 series			1
she has become @entity17 's most successful synchronized swimmer , collecting two @entity19 medals and more than a dozen at the world championships			1
" you can do anything -- you can create and ( be ) very original			0
it 's an artistic sport , " she added			2
then there 's the glitzy outfits -- and the hair , which is lacquered into a hard gloss with gelatine to keep it styled in the water			2
like @entity32 in tennis , @entity1 -- who is studying fashion design at university -- and her teammates play a role in creating the costumes they wear			1
the collaborative approach also applies to choosing music to routines and developing the choreography along with their coaches			0
@entity1 's big tune is " @entity47 " -- the ode to her home city sung by @entity50 and @entity51 , to which she performed at july 's world championships in the @entity4 capital			1
" it 's the music of @entity19 ' 92 and it 's very nice song and very nice choreography -- i think it 's very beautiful , " @entity1 explains			1
" the costume is like @entity59 -- in @entity47 very famous -- and blue and shiny like @entity51 when she sings			0
" the 2013 world championships were a special moment for the 23 - year - old			1
she was able to get close to the countries now dominating the sport , @entity67 and @entity68 , as she earned seven podium placings across the individual and team events			1
but it 's clear that for @entity1 , picking up silverware is n't her lone goal			2
being underwater for 20 seconds at a time -- unable to even communicate with your partner -- adds to the feeling of peaceful isolation			0
it 's an escape , however , that requires its participants to combine artistic elements with strength and technique , similar to rhythmic gymnastics or figure skating			0
on average @entity1 suspects she spends 10 hours in the pool a day -- a necessary workload if she is to catch her @entity67 and @entity68 rivals			1
while twisting , turning and lifting , competitors have to make sure the strain does n't show on their well - manicured faces -- sometimes they put the waterproof makeup on themselves but on other occasions they have makeup artists			0
any sign of straining and the judges are sure to pounce			0
the degree of difficulty is thus high			0
growing up in @entity47 , the vibrant city in northeastern @entity17 that rests by the @entity106 , paved the way for @entity1 's development in " synchro			2
" " when i was seven i did rhythmic gymnastics , " she recalls			0
" when i was nine i started synchronized swimming because i liked the water a lot			1
i spent a lot of hours in the sea			0
" it prepared her well for a life in the pool , which requires strong stamina			0
" there are many hard things in synchronized swimming but the hardest is to hold our breath inside the water , " @entity1 says			1
" when we go up and breathe , you have to do a good face and smile			0
" we have to work a lot to hold our breath because many moves in the performance are like 20 seconds without a breath			0
" we do n't communicate -- it 's impossible			0
sometimes when we do n't have music we speak inside the water but it 's very difficult and without goggles you see very bad			2
" you have to believe in each other			0
" in the team format that consists of eight swimmers -- one of the two @entity19 disciplines , while there are seven formats at the world championships -- @entity1 and company are aided by underwater speakers			1
" we listen perfectly inside and outside , too , and it 's nice because it 's like all the other people , " said @entity1			1
" a lot of people do n't know we have a speaker inside			2
" @entity17 , with @entity1 in the group , claimed a silver medal in all three team events in @entity47 , finishing second to @entity67			1
individually she collected four bronze medals , with @entity67 once again leading the way			2
@entity67 's clean sweep of all seven gold medals confirmed its status as the powerhouse of the sport , unlike the early days			1
when synchronized swimming first became an @entity19 sport in @entity169 in 1984 , @entity164 , the @entity165 and @entity166 led the way in the absence of the @entity173 nations -- who boycotted the @entity175 in retaliation for the @entity178 's refusal to attend @entity179 ' 80			1
" @entity67 is very difficult to get , " said @entity1			1
" @entity68 is difficult , too , but maybe i get			0
" @entity1 did win gold at the 2009 world championships in @entity182 in the team free routine , but the highlight of her career remains tallying a silver in the duet and team bronze at last year 's @entity19 in @entity190			1
caught up in the moment , she was unable to appreciate her achievements			0
it was only when @entity1 went on holiday did she fully reflect			2
" i ( thought ) a lot about the competition -- ' oh it 's a very , very big thing that we did , ' " she says			0
" for me , the most important result in my life is the silver medal in @entity190 because it 's very hard to get there			0
i 'm younger and my partner was like eight years older than me			0
@entity1 is now working towards the 2016 olympics in @entity207			2
" i think we go for gold , and work more , more , more , " she says			0
as for later in life , @entity1 is n't the sort to predict what she will be doing in 10 years			2
she wonders , though , if men will be allowed to compete in international tournaments at some stage			0
for some , men and synchronized swimming are forever linked to a skit on @entity165 comedy show @entity220 decades ago starring @entity221			1
" i do n't understand why in synchronized , there is not men 's , " said @entity1			1
" in ballet there are men			0
for me it would be very good if men start to do synchronized swimming			1

@entity1 is a world champion and @entity19 medalist in synchronized swimming
in @entity4 , @entity1 means " wave " and @entity1 says she feels better inside the water than out
when she is performing , @entity1 considers herself a " mermaid "
@entity67 dominates the sport , winning all seven golds at the 2013 world championships
