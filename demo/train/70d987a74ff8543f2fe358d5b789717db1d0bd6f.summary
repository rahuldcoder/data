nobody " likes " a loser			0
if losing the presidential election was n't enough , @entity2 has been hemorrhaging @entity5 friends			2
people began unliking @entity2 's official @entity5 page soon after the election results came in last week			1
the @entity9 noticed the drop on friday , when the @entity13 presidential candidate 's page was losing 593 likes an hour			2
by saturday , @entity14 said the exodus was up to 847 friends an hour , and as of monday morning , @entity2 's facebook page continued to lose around 11 likes every minute			1
for those who enjoy interactive graphics with their schadenfreude , the site @entity20 shows @entity2 's @entity5 likes dropping in real time			1
a ticker at the bottom of the page tallies how many people have unliked @entity2 's page just in the time users have been on the site			1
not that @entity2 is hurting for social media pals			1
as of monday afternoon , he still had more than 12 million @entity5 fans and 1.7 million followers on @entity35			0
the former governor 's team has n't been doing much on social media lately to persuade people to stick around			2
after a flurry of activity leading up to the election , his official @entity5 and @entity35 accounts went silent for four days afterward			1
on saturday , the campaign finally posted a photo of a sad - looking @entity2 with the message , " from the bottom of our hearts , @entity49 and i thank you for your support , prayers , efforts and vote			0
we are forever grateful to every one of you			0
" by contrast , president @entity56 acknowledged his victory last week with a pair of posts on @entity35 and @entity5 that quickly went viral			0
and his social media accounts have been active in the week since the election			0
@entity2 's recent silence extends to his running mate , @entity65 rep. @entity64 of @entity66 , whose campaign 's @entity35 account has not been updated since the election			1
however , @entity64 did update his personal ( pre-campaign ) @entity35 and @entity5 pages with two @entity72 posts over the weekend			0
the official @entity74 's @entity5 page has also been quiet since @entity75 , when it reposted a thank you to @entity2 from @entity13 chairman @entity78			1
after @entity56 was first elected four years ago , his official @entity35 , @entity5 and , yes , @entity80 pages ( it was 2008 , after all ) went quiet for a time			0
one explanation is that the staffers who manage these accounts either move on or are typically given new responsibilities after an election			0
it 's unlikely that @entity56 or @entity2 were posting to @entity5 and @entity35 very often themselves .			2

@entity2 's official @entity5 page has been losing 11 fans a minute
the campaign has been mostly silent on social media *platforms* since *tuesday*
a website , @entity94 , tracks his *declining* number of @entity5 likes
