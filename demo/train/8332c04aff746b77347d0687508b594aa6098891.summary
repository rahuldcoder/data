-- three of the best - loved leaders in the history of the @entity4 will be united this weekend when @entity5 makes his predecessors , pope @entity7 and pope @entity8 , saints in a special ceremony in @entity10			1
the two canonization candidates share an improbable path to sainthood : they both rose from very humble beginnings to lead the @entity4			0
@entity7 ( 1881 - 1963 ) -- known as @entity7 before he became @entity7 -- was one of 13 children born into a family of @entity18 peasants , farmers from a tiny village in the country 's north , before being sent away to study for the priesthood at the age of 11			1
@entity8 ( 1920 - 2005 ) , born @entity8 , was brought up in a grimy industrial town in @entity26 and raised by his soldier father after his mother died when he was just eight			1
he spent his formative years living under first nazis , then @entity30			0
for both boys , the church offered a way out -- and up			2
" @entity35 , unlike temporal power , has been one of the most effective social elevators on this planet , " says church historian @entity39 , " taking people from the most humble positions and bringing them to the top			2
" @entity44 analyst @entity43 says the pair 's poor backgrounds gave them a " pastoral sense " which was key to their success in the church -- and which goes some way to explaining their huge popularity			1
" they did not come from noble families either one of them , [ but from ] working class families and i think they also were two people who had a real sense of humanity			0
" the pair also turned out to be leaders with unforeseen qualities			0
@entity7 , already 76 when he was elected pope after a long career as a priest , professor and @entity44 diplomat , had been expected to serve merely as a " papa di passaggio , " or interim , caretaker @entity7			1
but instead , 100 days into his reign he took the surprising -- and courageous -- decision to try to shake up the church , calling for the @entity44 ( better known as @entity44 ) , which he hoped would modernize @entity35 , bring unity and improve its relations with other faiths			2
@entity8 , once an actor , had a presence before the cameras that enthralled millions of @entity4 young and old as he evangelized to the far ends of the earth			2
it 's not what he might have expected , growing up under not one but two dictatorial regimes			0
both men were much loved by the @entity84 faithful -- in their final days , masses were held for them around the globe , while thousands of people crowded into @entity10 to offer prayers			0
when @entity7 's death was announced , the crowds wept for " @entity91 " ( " @entity7 " ) ; more than 40 years later , when @entity8 died , thousands cried " santo subito ! " ( " make him a @entity94 now ! " )			1
it did n't happen right away , but @entity8 's canonization did come sooner than tradition would usually dictate			2
for @entity7 also , the rules have been changed ; he is credited with just one miracle , rather than the two which would usually be required for him to " qualify " as a saint			0
the pair 's double canonization is unprecedented : it will be the first time two @entity103 have been made saints on the same day			1
experts say that in recognizing the two men together , @entity5 may be looking to heal a long - term rift in the church , dating back to @entity44 , that ground - breaking conference of church leaders set up by @entity7			1
@entity8 -- who was to become @entity8 , but back then was simply a young bishop -- was at those meetings			1
he argued against @entity7 's planned " aggiornamento " ( " updating " ) and was in favor of keeping with tradition			0
the modernizing @entity7 -- already gravely ill when the meetings began -- died before the event could reach the conclusion he had hoped for			1
the splits have remained ever since			0
cardinal @entity120 , former president of the @entity121 , who knew both men , says pope @entity5 is hoping to repair that rift by canonizing the two men who have come to represent the two opposing views			1
" the pope is going to bring together in one ceremony the father of the council and [ the one ] who put it into action , " he explains			0
for cardinal @entity133 , former president of the @entity134 , the double canonization is a sign of the church 's future direction			0
" it 's official recognition that these were good popes and we will follow their steps now , " he says .			0
