-- a 3 - year - old adopted boy -- whose death in @entity4 has drawn stern criticism from @entity6 -- had more than 30 bruises , cuts and other marks on his body soon after he was pronounced dead , according to a report from a @entity4 medical examiner obtained by @entity0			1
along with his 2 - year - old brother , @entity13 arrived in the @entity15 with his adoptive parents in november 2012			1
just more than two months later , his adoptive mother told authorities that she found him unresponsive in the family 's @entity19 , @entity4 , backyard			1
he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at a nearby hospital			0
soon after @entity13 's death on january 21 , @entity6 's top child rights advocate tweeted that the boy had been " killed " or " murdered			1
" children 's rights commissioner @entity26 later acknowledged he might have spoken too soon -- though he has remained highly critical of the @entity15 handling of the case			1
@entity6 slams @entity4 prosecutors for not charging parents the documents were obtained thursday from the medical examiner 's offices for @entity34 and @entity35			1
they offered more details from the account by @entity39 and @entity40 about the boy 's time in @entity15 as well as the condition of his body at the time of his death			2
@entity6 's consul general in @entity48 has received the report , said @entity50 , a spokesman with @entity6 's embassy in @entity52			0
@entity6 officials will review the findings , but until then they have no comment			0
an investigator with the @entity34 office who examined @entity13 's body externally soon after his death documented 31 bruises , abrasions , scratches and other issues from head - to - toe , according to the death investigative report			2
both parents in the report claimed that the boy -- who they and a doctor said was born to an alcoholic mother -- would try to hurt himself in various ways			2
@entity6 concerned over adopted boy 's cause of death " they stated that ( @entity13 ) was displaying behaviors such as banging his head on the bathtub , throwing himself down , holding his breath and clawing himself , " wrote investigator @entity76			1
a @entity83 , @entity4 , doctor told authorities that after examining the child 's deteriorating condition during a second visit and listening to the parents ' accounts , he prescribed the boy @entity91 , an antipsychotic medication			1
the @entity94 said they first gave @entity13 the drug on january 15 but stopped on january 18 , concerned it was affecting his ability to swallow , the report said			0
@entity98 told authorities that she last saw @entity13 outside , believing he was about to go on a slide , just before she went inside to use the bathroom			0
she came out to find him prone on the ground , and she called his name and shook him vigorously before calling 911			0
the documents also included a preliminary autopsy report conducted by the @entity106 's office , completed on january 23			0
medical examiner @entity109 wrote to his colleagues in @entity34 , " based on the findings at this point , i suggest laceration of small bowel mesentry due to blunt trauma to ( the ) abdomen as the cause of death			0
i 'll leave the manner of death up to you pending investigation			0
" on the whole , there appears to be a strong likelihood that this death was accidental , probably the consequence of a fall from playground equipment in his yard			0
" the @entity34 medical examiner later concluded that @entity13 's death was accidental , finding that the bruises and other issues were consistent with a " self - inflicted " injury , district attorney @entity130 said march 1			0
@entity26 had accused the adoptive mother of killing the boy and giving him " psychotropic substances , " @entity6 's state - run @entity137 news agency reported			1
but toxicology reports came back negative , and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child 's death			0
soon after the news came out that @entity13 's death had been deemed accidental , @entity6 's @entity146 expressed concerns and noted it did not receive the information from @entity15 officials but rather from the media			1
it asked the @entity15 to give @entity6 consular representatives the relevant forensic documents , including a death certificate			2
a few weeks later , @entity26 again slammed @entity4 authorities -- this time after they decided not to charge the adoptive parents			1
@entity130 announced march 18 that a grand jury had declined to indict @entity39 and @entity40 , adding that they 'd found no evidence to charge the people and stating the boy died of a " tragic accident			2
" the @entity6 child rights advocate responded to that development with a tweet , reported by a @entity137 , claiming the district attorney had n't done enough to the investigate the death of the boy also known as @entity170			0
" the @entity4 prosecutors ' position in the case of @entity170 is upsetting because they refused to scrutinize the circumstances of his death , " @entity26 wrote			0
the boy 's death aggravated @entity178 efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which @entity15 families have already begun the process to adopt a @entity6 child before @entity184 in december passed a law banning adoptions of @entity6 children by @entity15			1
that law bans adoptions by @entity15 ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents			1
but others say the @entity6 move is in retaliation for a @entity15 law that places restrictions on @entity6 human rights abusers			2
@entity15 adopted close to 1,000 @entity6 children last year , according to @entity178 figures			1
though the number has dropped in recent years , @entity6 remains the third-most popular foreign country after @entity202 and @entity203 for @entity15 foreign adoptions .			2

a 3 - year - old @entity6 boy adopted by a @entity4 couple died in january
a @entity6 official has slammed @entity15 authorities ' handling of the case
a @entity4 investigator found more than 30 cuts , bruises , other marks on the dead boy
the adoptive parents said the boy *frequently* hurt himself , a new document states
