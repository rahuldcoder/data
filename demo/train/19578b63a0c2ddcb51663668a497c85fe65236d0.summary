-- @entity1 , @entity3 's high - profile entry into the world of wearable tech , may help launch a revolution if it 's released later this year as expected			1
but test models already on the street have begun playing a more unlikely role -- as symbols in a simmering fight over @entity13 's impact on the city of @entity15			1
it 's a local story , but one with ramifications everywhere as @entity3 on tuesday made the connected headsets available to the public for the first time in a one - day sale			2
while our smartphones drop easily into pockets and tablets get zipped up in cases or backpacks , wearables such as @entity1 are , quite literally , in your face all the time			1
the $ 1,500 device , which displays web content on a tiny screen , signals its wearer as a likely member of an affluent tech elite			2
and @entity1 also can discreetly shoot photos or video , which some people view as invasive			1
that 's caused unease for some folks and , in some cases has led to arguments , altercations and even attacks against people wearing the technology			1
@entity49 , a reporter for @entity50 , wrote sunday that he was walking home after covering a protest march against a @entity3 employee who reportedly had bought a property and then evicted its tenants			0
he was wearing , but not using , the eyewear " when a person put their hand on my face and yelled , ' @entity1 ! ' in an instant , the person was sprinting away , @entity1 in hand			1
" @entity49 says he ran after the woman , who then " pivoted , shifting their weight to put all of their momentum into an overhand swing			0
the @entity1 smashed into the ground , and they ran in another direction			1
" tension city in the column , @entity49 said he thinks the protest and attack friday were linked , though he does not think the woman who did it was at the march			2
" my love for gadgets makes me look and sound like one of the people whom residents of the city have come to feel oppressed by , " he wrote			2
" the individual who smashed my @entity1 on friday -- because of political beliefs or a personal impact that has been made by the tech industry -- felt that it was appropriate to destroy my personal property in protest against what i seemed to stand for , based on my appearance ; never mind the irony in choosing to assault someone based on their appearance as a way to preserve @entity15 's culture , " he wrote			1
on monday , a @entity3 spokesman condemned the attack			0
" targeting anyone for a crime because of what they wear is wrong , " the spokesman said in a statement			0
" we have reached out to the person to see what we can do to help			0
" in recent months , tensions have run high in @entity15 over the perceived role that tech - industry giants have had on the city			1
protesters complain that an influx of highly paid tech workers is driving up rents , forcing out longtime residents and robbing the city of its famously eccentric character			1
related story : would you want @entity1 in class ? most of the anti-tech fervor has focused on big - name companies such as @entity3 and @entity128 and the private bus systems that ferry their employees from the city to various corporate headquarters in @entity13			1
but individual employees are increasingly being targeted , too			0
just last week , protesters picketed in front of the private home of @entity137 , co-founder of @entity138 and now a partner with @entity140			0
the protesters , who posted signs calling @entity143 a " parasite , " claimed his group , which helps @entity3 decide which startups to invest money in , has helped to inflate prices in the city			2
friday 's march targeted @entity151 , an attorney for @entity3 , who protesters say bought a building , where he intends to live , and evicted tenants who had been renting there			2
glass as a flashpoint but while the tensions over housing in @entity15 have been bubbling for some time , it 's relatively new for @entity1 to be targeted , either over privacy concerns or as a presumed symbol of the tech industry as a whole			1
in late february , a woman says she was attacked at a bar on @entity15 's famous @entity167 after fellow patrons began heckling her and trying to rip @entity1 off of her face			1
in a video @entity171 shared with @entity173 , a woman can be heard saying " you 're killing the city " while approaching @entity171 and apparently trying to rip the headset off of her face			0
another man is shown similarly trying to grab the device			0
@entity171 said the man eventually took the headset and ran out of the bar with it			0
she was able to retrieve her glass but says her purse and phone were stolen			0
@entity3 is clearly cognizant of the concerns some people have about @entity1 and has acted to encourage " explorers " -- people who have been publicly field - testing the devices since early last year -- not to behave in ways that stoke @entity192 sentiment			2
in february , the company issued a list of tips for explorers that included not being " creepy or rude ( aka a ' @entity198 ' )			0
" other advice included always asking permission before taking a photo or shooting a video of someone , and being careful not to " glass out , " or just sit idly with the device on when others are around			0
it 's hard to know whether the @entity15 attacks were just isolated incidents or whether others might be targeted similarly			1
one suspects that when the digital headsets become widely available , presumably later this year , people will become more accustomed to seeing them			0
@entity171 , the woman attacked in the @entity15 bar , hopes potential users wo n't be discouraged			1
" i hope this incident does n't deter people from wearing @entity1 , because 95 % of the time , my experience is 180 degrees different , " she told @entity173			2
" most people are just excited , curious			0
i usually end up demonstrating them , showing them to people , letting them try them on			0

two recent cases saw @entity1 users attacked in @entity15
both appeared linked to protests over tech industry 's role in the city
protesters say tech jobs are *gentrifying* the classically quirky city
users say most glass *interactions* are *positive*
