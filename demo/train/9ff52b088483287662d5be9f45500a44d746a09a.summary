@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 expressed outrage thursday after the release of @entity5 , a cardiologist who in 2009 confessed to killing his children as they slept in their beds			1
what many wanted to know was how a father who stabbed his children dozens of times could be free after 46 months of confinement			1
those voices echo the grief of @entity5 's ex-wife , dr. @entity14 , the mother of 5 - year - old @entity15 and 3 - year - old @entity16			1
as @entity17 pored over her children 's autopsy reports , she wished she had no idea what they meant			1
but as a physician and a coroner , she knows it 's true : her children suffered a long , gruesome death			2
" i knew it was not a short death			0
you know , my little boy received 20 stabs of a knife , he had seven marks of defense , " she told @entity2 in an interview at her home before @entity5 's full release			1
" he had no wound that was the one that gave him death , " she added , trying to hold back tears			0
" my little girl , she had 19 wounds , maybe she was luckier ? because she had one that was more mortal than the other			0
but she felt 19 shots , that 's for sure , " @entity17 said			2
@entity5 confessed to killing his children in february 2009 but a year later a @entity1 jury failed to convict him of the murders , finding him not criminally responsible due to mental illness			1
at trial , @entity5 testified that he was distraught over his crumbling marriage and snapped , insisting he blacked out and does n't remember killing his children			2
the jury believed the testimony of two psychiatrists paid for by his defense			0
they testified that @entity5 could not have known what he was doing when he repeatedly stabbed his children			1
" why do n't i accept that he is mentally ill is when i look at the facts , " @entity17 said			0
" we have a person that is a cardiologist that never had a psychiatric incident , not at all			0
i have trouble to understand how someone in five hours or six hours will do an interview of someone and have a conclusion that he is not a danger to society or is mentally insane			0
" even the @entity1 government has weighed in , calling @entity5 's release " unacceptable			1
" " we believe that @entity14 does not deserve to live in fear of her children 's killer and neither do victims of similar crimes across @entity1 , " said @entity80 , a federal cabinet minister			1
the @entity87 government of prime minster @entity88 is drafting legislation to make it more difficult for mentally ill offenders to be released from psychiatric facilities , but the pending legislation is not expected to influence @entity5 's case			2
in fact , @entity5 told the psychiatric review board that released him that he is looking forward to leading a normal life in the future and hopes to practice medicine and have children again			2
" to know that my children faced the person that they should have trusted the most and they were left by themselves to die			0
no one holding their hand , " @entity17 said			0
" i struggle , ok , i struggle all the days , every day of my life and i think till i die i will struggle			0

children 's mother , also a doctor , says she wants answers
