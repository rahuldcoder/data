-- @entity1 has seen a lot of changes in his country			1
today , the self - made mogul oversees @entity6 , one of the largest tour operators in @entity9			1
he has made millions introducing his clients to the splendor of his country , whether taking them on elephant treks in @entity14 , or giving them an opportunity to get close to the local chimps at @entity18			2
" personally i 've traveled the whole world , and i think one of the things i am advantaged with is having seen my own country as a tour guide , and seen how the tourists were shocked about the beauty of this area , " he says			0
in the last few years , @entity1 has seen tourism numbers swell , but that was n't always the case			1
though 2013 saw 1.2 million travelers ( a 50 % increase over the last five years ) , tourism was at a standstill for many decades in the aftermath of @entity36 's bloodthirsty reign			1
in the shadow of " @entity36 " two year before @entity1 's birth , @entity36 had forcefully taken control of the country			1
@entity36 declared himself @entity41 , @entity42 of the @entity43 and @entity44			1
he also liked to be called " @entity36 " , though his countrymen would eventually bestow a different moniker in the wake of his reign of terror : the @entity49 of @entity9			1
" at the time i was born , it was a difficult time for every @entity9			1
there were a lot of challenges economically for @entity9			1
and people tried to find ways to survive , " @entity1 recalls of his challenging childhood			1
" my family was close to the border and all they could do was smuggle stuff from @entity63			2
i think as a child , i was involved in smuggling by the age of seven			2
" the 50 cent salary there was nothing swift about @entity1 's rise			1
after school , he worked sweeping floors , earning $ 10 a month			0
" i was living , to be honest , on half a dollar a week , " he recalls			0
his luck would eventually change when scored got a job as a tour guide			2
" i remember very well my first trip			0
we had three tourists and we went around for 15 days			0
we were doing camping , we had to put up tents , had to cook breakfast for the guys , and stir the campfire until the last person finished smoking , maybe 3 am			0
it was a draining job , " he recalls			2
when he decided to set up his own firm in 2001 , he found he got little support			0
" people would say , ' you were born in a poor family , we told you , you ca n't do business , ' " he says			1
" i mean 99 % of the people that surrounded were telling me ' you ca n't succeed			0
you do n't have a background of business			0
' but i knew in my heart that you know what , i think @entity104 has given me this opportunity and tried me out , and i 'm going to make sure i succeed in this thing			0
" today , @entity1 has made millions and become one of the go - to @entity9 tour guides with a company providing 180 jobs to the local economy			1
" the company has grown to be one of the top three safari companies in the country			0
but i think one of things i like about this is having been the first @entity9 to build accommodation inside a national park			2
( it inspired ) so many @entity9 to start building			2
now we are seeing a lot of @entity9 saying , ' you know what ' if @entity1 can do it , i can do it			1
' " watch the video below to learn more about how @entity131 continues to push the local community to bigger and better things			0
