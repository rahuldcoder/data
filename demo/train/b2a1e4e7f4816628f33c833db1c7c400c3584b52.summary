-- yes , it 's a limited sample			0
yes , it 's more likely for people who are disgruntled to comment than people who are pleased			0
@entity5 expressed strong reservations about a possible @entity9 - @entity8 merger			1
but still : @entity0 users who responded to our @entity12 and blog queries about the possible @entity16 merger were really , really unhappy			1
" put ' going to a rock concert ' on your list of ' things you used to do , but ca n't anymore , ' along with watching free television , seeing a double - feature with a cartoon , and riding a train cross country , " wrote @entity17			1
" ahh , the beginning of yet another monopoly			0
i hope the feds nix this one , " added @entity28			0
" @entity9 is already nearly a monopoly in the ticket game			1
@entity8 is built on greed			1
might be a marriage made in heaven for them , but it 's a marriage made in hell for the concert - going public , " wrote @entity35			1
many who commented were compelled to share their horror stories , of which there were many			0
" i was recently at a concert where i sat at the top of the stadium -- read : the worst seats , " wrote @entity45			2
" and i was surrounded by people who had bought their tickets through a @entity9 pre-sale			1
so lem me get this straight ... @entity9 rewards its customers and loyal fans by providing them with the worst seats in the house ( even when selecting ' best available ' ) during a pre-sale ? " " i hoped @entity8 would provide competition for @entity9 and the outlandish surcharges and service fees , " wrote avettbrosfan			1
" unfortunately , when i went to buy a ' 30 dollar ' lawn ticket to see the @entity64 and @entity65 , the @entity8 surcharges bumped the ticket up to 52 dollars ! so much for that hope			1
" read more comments on the @entity71 blog other people wrote of being forced to pay $ 100 surcharges , of being sent to other ticket sites ( including @entity9 's own premium site , @entity76 ) and of all the other costs to go to a concert , such as parking , refreshments and merchandise			1
@entity12 : your reaction to the possible merger " here in @entity86 , the [ @entity5 ] @entity76 tickets were available immediately when the tickets when on sale			2
those seats were never available to the public to begin with			2
' reputable brokers ' means ' really just us using a different name , ' " wrote @entity91 , @entity92 still , @entity9 had its defenders			2
the company 's web site is clean and simple , and it beats the old days of camping out at stores , wrote @entity101			2
" i remember all too well those days of standing in line for hours at @entity103 to get to their @entity9 outlet , and still getting lousy tickets , " he said			2
" i 'll be glad for the day when all tickets are available from one single outlet online			0
" lost in all this is the impact on musicians , who seldom have a choice regarding ticket sellers at large venues			0
@entity115 had its protest in the ' 90s ; @entity5 sounded off on the sales snafu for his 2009 tour			0
but in general , if you want to see -- or play -- a concert , there are n't many options			0
" i could have gone on for hours about this			0
the fact is , i would love to change my purchasing plans , but how can i ? if i want to see a show , what option do i have ? " said musician , and music fan , @entity129 on @entity12			0
ireport.com : read more of @entity129 's comments " sure , i can purchase off of @entity134 or @entity135 ... but i do n't want to pay even more than i 'm already being ripped off			0
the other end is even if i 'm purchasing second hand ... the original purchaser still supported [ @entity9 / @entity8 ] ... so i 'm damned if i do and i 'm damned if i do n't , " @entity129 said .			1

@entity9 and @entity8 are reportedly in merger talks
@entity0 users have few nice things to say about either company
" @entity147 made in hell for concert - going public , " said one user
