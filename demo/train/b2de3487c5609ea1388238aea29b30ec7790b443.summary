@entity0 -- @entity2 on thursday blamed the creation of the " @entity2 character " that she has become synonymous with in part on a @entity7 fertility specialist who , she said , had her sign a consent form while she was drugged			1
the @entity7 woman said she did not mean to have eight children in january 2009 , in addition to the six she already had			2
but while she admitted she did want more children , she insisted she was in no condition to understand a form dr. @entity16 put in front of her before implanting 12 embryos			1
" he wrote something , he gave it to me to sign , " @entity2 told @entity21 's dr. @entity20 on thursday night			1
she said she was then on " a cocktail of drugs " including @entity26 at the @entity28 doctor 's office because her uterus was contracting			1
" i signed it , and i did n't read it			0
" @entity16 lost his @entity7 medical license july 1 after state officials ruled that he committed " gross negligence " with " repeated negligent acts , for an excessive number of embryo transfers " into @entity2 in 2008 , the state 's medical board wrote			2
the same report determined that the doctor felt the implantation was driven " by the patient 's wishes			0
" during a hearing for the doctor last october , it was revealed @entity2 still has 29 frozen embryos in storage			1
contrary to some reports , though , the 36 - year - old woman insisted thursday that she does n't want any more children			0
that said , the single mother -- who said she has been celibate for 12 years , and had all 14 children by in vitro fertilization -- admitted that she chose to have children in part to address her emotional baggage			1
" is it fair to have a bunch of kids help solve your emotional issues ? of course not , " she said			1
" with children , i feel so safe in my predictable world			0
they will never leave me			0
kids love you , unconditionally			0
" @entity2 admits that she has a host of problems , including anxiety , panic attacks , hyperactivity and obsessive compulsive disorder			1
" my brain and body are racing constantly , " she added , noting she exercises extensively and only gets two hours of sleep a night			0
but expressing regret for contributing to " this mess ( that ) has deleteriously affected my kids , " @entity2 said that she 's now speaking out in part to refute having been made into what she called a " parody without permission			1
" " i have the spotlight , i know it 's my responsibility ( for my kids ) to brush it away and get rid of the @entity2 character , " she said			1
with no steady income and expenses of over $ 18,000 a month , @entity2 has struggled to get by raising her children			1
she has previously hosted a yard sale at her @entity97 , @entity7 , home to deal with the hardship , and had reportedly signed on to be on the @entity100 reality tv show " @entity101			0
" and now , @entity2 said she is grateful for money she gets from media interviews , especially with overseas outlets			2
she also claims to have received " hundreds of death threats , " some targeting her children , as well as a few female stalkers			0
" i am hated in my hometown , " she said			0
still , @entity2 said that despite the difficulties she feels things are improving			2
and despite her admitted anxiety , paranoia and continued efforts to shield her children -- barring any television or @entity114 in the house -- she is most at peace at home			0
" i feel safest at home with my kids , " she said			2
" and i want to be only there , that 's my favorite time at night , in my pajamas playing twister			0
