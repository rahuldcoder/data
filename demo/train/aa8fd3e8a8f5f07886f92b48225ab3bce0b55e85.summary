-- if there were any doubt that the members of the @entity6 troupe would n't be holding back in their farewell show , it came with a rousing version of " @entity9			1
" the performance of the " @entity12 " song included a whole range of props , including cannons in the shape of phalluses			0
and what 's the point of bringing out phallus - shaped cannons if you 're not going to , uh , set them off ? @entity6 has always been equal parts deadpan and silly , highbrow and low , and the " @entity25 ( mostly ) " show -- which concluded sunday at @entity27 's @entity26 and was simulcast all over the world -- highlighted those distinctions			1
among the sketches performed by the group were the @entity32 , in which the four attempt to one - up each another in remembering horrible childhoods ; " @entity35 , " in which @entity37 's inspector challenges @entity39 ' confectioner over some interesting chocolate creations ; and , of course , the " @entity42 , " which was combined with the " @entity44 " sketch , allowing @entity37 and @entity45 to indulge in their fondness for synonyms and euphemisms			0
in that one , @entity37 and @entity45 seemed to be having a particularly good time , stepping on each other 's lines in high - spirited confusion			0
@entity37 also got in an impromptu knock against a @entity55 newspaper editor			0
the " @entity25 ( mostly ) " show has gotten decent reviews ( mostly ) during its three - week run , many praising the group for its contribution to comedy if lamenting the casualness of the live production			1
the final show was apparently little changed from the debut , with its many musical numbers and occasional hesitations			1
there were a couple special guests for the final show -- @entity71 and @entity72 -- and physicist @entity73 , who joined a videotaped skit , was in the live audience			1
nevertheless , if the group did n't break any new ground , then again , it did n't have to			1
" it gives the crowd exactly what they want but relies pretty heavily on the fan love and makes a hefty withdrawal from the reputation bank , " wrote @entity80 's @entity79 when the show debuted			2
in a not - quite - full @entity90 theater where the show was simulcast , fans cheered their favorites , anticipating the @entity93 and singing along with " @entity94			1
" there were a couple audio glitches at the beginning , but for the most part it was an enjoyable afternoon , with the show functioning more as a celebration of @entity6 history than a demand for new material			2
indeed , fans looked on the bright side of @entity6 all over			2
in @entity108 , @entity109 , a storm knocked out the audio , but the audience simply started a singalong			0
as the show came to a close , two frames came up on the @entity117 's big screen : " @entity120 1941 - 1989 , " in memory of the late @entity6 member , and " @entity6 1969 - 2014			0
" if this is indeed the end , @entity6 can go out knowing its legacy is secure			0
and that 's not so completely different .			0

" @entity25 ( mostly ) " concluded sunday
