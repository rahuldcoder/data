-- what role , if any , did legally purchased and consumed marijuana play in a husband 's alleged murder of his wife this week in @entity6 ? that 's what police are investigating in the shooting death of @entity11 , who called 911 monday and , according to a police affidavit , said her husband , @entity13 , was hallucinating after he had " taken some marijuana			1
" " this is under investigation , " @entity6 police spokeswoman @entity16 said about the possibility of marijuana use			1
@entity11 , 44 , told a 911 operator that her husband also may have been on some prescription medication for back pain , according to a police affidavit			1
the affidavit , written by a police detective , recounts details of the 13 - minute 911 call that ended with what the detective described as " the sound of a gunshot			1
" according to the affidavit : @entity11 told the 911 operator that her husband was speaking ominously about " the @entity35 " and said he wanted her to shoot him			1
she said she feared for herself and her three children , who were in the house			0
" at one point during the call ( she ) sounds panicked and tells the 911 operator that @entity13 was taking the firearm out of the safe , " the affidavit says			1
seconds later the 911 operator heard screams and there was a gunshot sound			2
police arrived at the home to find @entity11 dead , a gunshot wound to her head			2
as an officer put @entity13 in the backseat of a patrol car , he admitted " without questioning " that he killed his wife , a police document says			1
on friday , @entity6 district attorney @entity60 charged @entity13 with first - degree murder in his wife 's death			1
it could not be determined friday whether @entity13 had retained an attorney on his own			2
the @entity6 public defender 's office did n't immediately return a call			2
investigators took a blood sample to determine whether @entity13 was under the influence of any substances at the time of the shooting			0
but even if those blood tests reveal traces of tetrahydrocannabinol -- or @entity80 , the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana -- some are saying it 's unfair and irresponsible to blame the killing on his alleged use of marijuana			0
" i think there are a lot of facts that we do n't know about this story " said @entity87 , executive director of @entity88 -- the @entity89			0
" bottom line : any drug , whether it 's caffeine , nicotine , alcohol , cocaine , prescription drugs -- they all come with certain levels of health risks			0
that 's one of the reasons we 're right to be regulating ( marijuana ) " during a search of the @entity13 's home , police found a receipt in the basement for purchases made on the day of the killing at a marijuana dispensary called @entity116 , according to a warrant			1
@entity13 spent $ 32.70 on two items : @entity120 -- a type of candy - form marijuana -- and @entity119 -- a pre-rolled joint			2
@entity124 became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana , allowing pot stores to open for business on january 1			1
a @entity116 employee hung up immediately when a @entity0 reporter identified himself friday			0
" as tragic as this is " said @entity87 , " we ca n't look at this one isolated incident and say that ( legalizing marijuana ) was the wrong path to go down			0
the best way to keep marijuana safe is for regulatory oversight and testing			0
" @entity13 is being held without bond in the @entity143			0
