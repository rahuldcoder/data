in 2012 the @entity1 people sent a message			2
they elected more women than ever to @entity4 , shattering glass ceilings across the nation and making it clear that this is a country that is ready for women 's leadership			1
it 's happening because voters know female leaders have the right priorities			1
they 've fought for policies like the @entity16 and equal pay for equal work			0
female leaders are the reason we have laws that ended gender discrimination in education			2
but even though we know women 's leadership has helped create so much progress , there is still a " men only " sign on the door to the @entity30			1
across the country , @entity1 know it 's time to change that			0
it 's time to capitalize on the demand for women 's leadership , harness the energy and ignite a movement that will put a woman in the @entity41			1
2016 poll : if @entity43 does n't run , then who ? today , @entity45 is launching a campaign to make that a reality			1
our community of 2 million women and men across the country has worked to elect women to offices up and down the ballot			1
in my personal journey , i know how difficult it is to put women in leadership roles			1
the first campaign i managed was my own			2
i ran many times and lost many times when i ran for class president in my high school			0
in my junior year , i decided that i should run for student body president , because it was n't just my class voting but the entire school			2
i put together a campaign plan that targeted only the freshmen and sophomore votes			1
i even got the younger sister of my opponent to join my campaign			0
in the process , i learned my first campaign lesson : never underestimate the power of women			1
there 's a sister , and there 's sisterhood			0
now , i get to see that sisterhood at work every day			0
in the past 28 years @entity45 has become the nation 's largest resource for women in politics , and in that time we 've done extensive research on women 's leadership and women 's priorities			1
our most recent polling , conducted on likely 2016 voters in battleground states , proves without a doubt that the @entity1 people are ready for a female chief executive			0
ninety percent of the people we polled say they would vote for a woman for president and 75 % say a female president would be a good thing for the country			0
of those surveyed , more thought a female president than a male president would be likely to put families ahead of politics and end partisan bickering			0
that 's something we 've known about women since we started helping them run for office in the 1980s			1
@entity117 gives a bit of a wink to idea of @entity43 in 2016 these female leaders have fought -- and fought hard -- to take a place at the table and make laws that improve the lives of @entity1 women and families			2
because of this we know , our community knows , and countless @entity1 across the country know , that now is the time for a woman to be at the head of the table			0
so who will it be ? there 's one name on all our minds : @entity140			2
voters across the country are excited about her possible run			2
but if she decides not to run , we still have a deep bench of incredible female leaders to choose from			1
from cabinet secretaries and senators to the many female governors we 'll have after 2014 ; there are numerous women who are ready to take on the challenge of leading our nation			0
long after we 've elected the first female president , we 're going to keep electing even more @entity1 women , building a pipeline of state legislators and members of @entity4 , mayors and governors and senators , who will work their way up the ranks and be the second and 10th female presidents			1
we are standing on the edge of history			0
we are standing on the shoulders of the senators and suffragettes , civil rights activists and founding mothers , who have been the backbone of this great country			0
it 's time for us to take the next step and make electing a female president part of our national story			0
when a woman runs for president , she will hear this one thing loud and clear from millions of women and men : we stand with you -- and we believe you can win			1
@entity1 is ready to elect its first madam president .			0

@entity186 : in 2012 , voters elected more women to @entity4 than ever before
@entity186 : despite progress , there is still a " men only " sign on the door to the @entity30
