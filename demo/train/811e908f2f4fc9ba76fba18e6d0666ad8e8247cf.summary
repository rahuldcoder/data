@entity0 -- @entity1 's @entity2 and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each sunday on " @entity5 " to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days , weeks and months ahead			2
one last campaign 2014 maneuver and several intriguing post-election shifts and calculations made for a fun trip around the table			0
new ground troops -- in @entity14 there is one more round in the 2014 election , and @entity18 are heavily favored : the @entity14 runoff for the @entity20 between @entity22 sen. @entity21 and @entity18 rep. @entity23			1
so put this one in the " taking nothing for granted " file : a @entity18 source tells @entity1 the @entity27 is sending in 350 field workers to help with the december 6 get - out - the - vote effort			0
democrats , too , say they will bolster their staff there now that all the other campaigns are over			0
but @entity21 faces a bigger question : whether to invite president @entity35 down for the runoff			1
he has been persona non grata during the election , but many party strategists think @entity21 's only chance is sky - high @entity43 - @entity42 turnout			1
watch out , @entity45 : @entity47 's 2015 plans if @entity48 , the presumed new @entity20 majority leader , is ever trying to find sen. @entity47 of @entity49 , he might just want to turn and look over his shoulder			1
the freshman @entity52 favorite makes no bones about believing that @entity45 is too establishment and too accommodating			1
@entity56 of the @entity57 chatted with @entity47 on election night and came away with the distinct impression @entity47 will be tracking every @entity45 move			1
" i asked him about whether or not the party should try to sort of back off the repeal of the @entity63 or try to compromise on immigration , " said @entity56			0
" he said emphatically not , and in fact he said the only way to keep faith with the folks that elected them was to stand by the issues that had done so			0
and he said the biggest two issues for his party of the cycle were , a , repealing @entity63 , as he called it , and b , stopping the president 's illegal executive action , as he called it , on immigration			2
" next year , @entity56 points out , @entity45 might be wishing @entity47 finds himself in @entity79 more often than in @entity0			1
and memo to @entity45 : enjoy it while you can it long has been his dream job			1
now , as @entity45 prepares to rise to majority leader , the 2016 lineup suggests he might want to savor every minute			1
@entity88 's @entity87 notes that the 2016 map is to republicans what the 2014 map was to @entity22 -- as in tough			2
" there are a number of @entity27 senators that we are going to be looking at very closely on whether or not they decide to run again , " said @entity87			0
" people like @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity101 of @entity102 , @entity103 in @entity104			0
there are several others -- @entity107 in @entity79			0
" @entity87 notes that if those @entity18 senators retire , then the @entity22 have a chance to take those seats -- and maybe take back the @entity20 majority			1
how @entity35 tries to get over a bad election -- head to @entity114 @entity114 trips are a long haul -- a drain on any president			1
but @entity35 perhaps is dreading this one a little less , because it gets him out of a @entity0 buzzing about how the midterm election further weakened his political clout			2
so off he goes , but not without reminders that news travels fast these days			0
@entity125 of @entity126 notes that the @entity129 , before they roll out the red carpet , apparently are eager to tell their people it is a weakened @entity42 president coming to visit			2
" officials are right now increasingly nervous about the reception he is going to get in @entity129 , " said @entity125			2
" there 's a newspaper in @entity129 that 's connected to the government that wrote a story before he left saying that the @entity42 public had ' downgraded ' the president and was tired of his ' banality			1
same leaders on @entity144 but ... @entity145 faced buzz in the middle of the campaign that the @entity149 was less than thrilled with her performance as @entity152 chairwoman			0
now , as @entity22 sort through the rubble of the results from their perspective , the ambitious @entity154 congresswoman is getting even more heat from fellow @entity22			0
@entity159 of the @entity160 took us inside the debate over whether -- or when -- the @entity152 would be under new leadership			0
" she has said she wants to serve out her term -- it ends in january 2017 -- and in some ways there 's questions about whether or not she 's close enough to @entity170 , and whether she 'd want her to stay on , " said @entity164			0
" but it 'll be interesting to see whether or not she 's able to stick it out or move on			2

@entity35 may get a *lukewarm* welcome in @entity129
@entity47 expected to track @entity45 's every move in the 2015 @entity20
will @entity21 invite @entity35 down to @entity14 for the runoff ?
