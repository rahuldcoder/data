@entity0 used to find solace in the sweet taste of ice cream			1
growing up , she would sneak downstairs after her family had gone to sleep and numb her anxiety by digging into a half - gallon container			1
she would eat until she was sick , knowing this was something she had to do in secret			1
as the oldest child of a struggling @entity11 family , @entity0 shouldered a lot of responsibilities at a young age			1
her mother suffered from a number of health issues , and her father worked three jobs just to put food on the table			0
the family 's financial struggles had a huge impact on @entity0 's diet			1
nearly all @entity0 's family was overweight , as they had neither the resources nor the knowledge to prepare healthy meals regularly			1
they ate a lot of ground beef , spaghetti and the occasional treat of a take - and - bake pizza			0
they would wait in line for government - issued cheese and foodstuffs like powdered eggs and milk			0
" healthy eating requires money and time , something financially stressed families have little of , " she said			2
" we ate what was quick and cheap and familiar			0
" @entity0 knew she was overweight in the first grade when she looked down and saw her feet swelling out of her @entity54			1
but it was n't until her freshman year of high school that she made the connection between what she was eating and her body size			2
one day she found herself staring into the vending machine of the gym locker room			0
she was 5 - feet - 5 - inches and 200 pounds			2
" at that moment it finally struck me that what i ate made me overweight , " she said			0
" you 'd think i would know that			0
i was an honors student			0
" @entity0 changed her diet and started exercising regularly			1
in two years she went from 200 to 150 pounds			2
but there was one change she was still unable to make : sneaking food at night to comfort herself			2
consuming large quantities of ice cream had a calming effect			1
she had no other way to cope with her anxiety , so she was unable to keep the weight off			1
she married in 1996 and moved to @entity77			0
she stopped running and her weight climbed			2
she grew depressed when she realized the church she had joined was n't as welcoming as the one in her hometown of @entity81 , which was her only social outlet as a child			2
she stopped weighing herself when she hit 265 pounds			1
in 2005 , she divorced her husband and moved to @entity85 to start rebuilding her life			0
she gave her car to a relative and started walking and biking everywhere , losing 50 pounds almost without effort			2
that same year , she met @entity89			0
she was pursuing her degree in psychology at the @entity92 at the time and weighed 215 pounds			2
while @entity89 was interested in pursuing a romantic relationship , @entity0 would n't allow herself to think that he could be in love with her			1
" that 's part of being overweight , " she said			0
" the last thing you want to do is humiliate yourself by assuming someone likes you romantically			0
" she moved to @entity101 to get a doctorate degree in @entity103 and family studies , but she and @entity89 reconnected when she returned to @entity85			0
they bonded over raising teenage boys : @entity0 had adopted her son , @entity107 , in 2010 , and @entity89 was taking care of his teenage brother			1
it was as though they had never been apart			0
this time @entity0 was open to letting herself be loved by @entity113			1
" you ca n't live on someone else 's love ; you have to be ok on your own , " she said			0
" but i needed that to start taking care of myself , to start filling up those holes on my own			0
" @entity89 told @entity0 about how he had lost a lot of weight on a low - sugar diet and encouraged her to try it for herself			1
and , more importantly , my ice cream had sugar			1
" upwave : take the cut back on sugar challenge ! but at 215 pounds , she figured it was about time she let go of her reliance on food to ease her anxiety			2
she eliminated pastries , fast food , ice cream and even fruit with high amounts of sugar from her diet			1
instead , she started eating salmon , tofu and grapefruit , learning the difference between emotional hunger and physical hunger			0
" about four to five days in , my sugar cravings dropped			0
after two weeks , i did n't even care if there were cookies at work			0
" in a little more than a year , by the time she and @entity89 were married in june 2012 , @entity0 had gone from 215 pounds to 157 pounds			1
today she weighs 142 pounds			1
@entity0 maintains this weight by enjoying limited amounts of foods she now considers " treats			2
" for breakfast , she has a protein shake made with cranberry juice and probiotics			0
she also stays active by walking two miles as part of her regular commute , and running or going to the gym on weekends			0
instead of sneaking ice cream at night , she now sets aside time for meditation in order to cope with stress			1
she does n't keep any of her old escapes in the house , not even low - sugar ice cream			1
" when i was overweight , i think people judged me somehow as less competent and efficient , " she said			0
the guilt and shame i felt sneaking ice cream at night is gone			1

at night , @entity0 would eat ice cream in secret to cope with her anxiety
growing up , her family did n't eat healthy meals
@entity0 stopped weighing herself at 265 pounds ; she now weighs 142 pounds
