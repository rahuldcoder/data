-- sports fans may have been deprived of another chance to see @entity4 stake his claim to be considered the greatest footballer of all time after @entity8 failed to progress to the final of the @entity10			0
but far from the bright lights of @entity16 's @entity15 , in a quiet corner of @entity13 , another athlete was busy rewriting the history books			0
humans have been selectively breeding racehorses for 300 years , always in search of that elusive specimen of equine perfection who can redefine our idea of what might be possible on four legs			0
in @entity28 , we may have found it			2
in action for the first time since last october in the @entity34 @entity33 at @entity35 , for his trainer , @entity36 , it was a chance to show the world that his colt had overcome a leg injury sustained on @entity42 gallops , news of which had sent shockwaves throughout the racing world			1
brutal beauty for his jockey , @entity48 , it was a chance to prove that the four - year - old @entity28 was a more mature , calmer beast than the @entity28 of last season , without losing any of his domineering physicality or brutal beauty			1
for @entity28 , it was first blood in a senior campaign that could see him elevated to the ranks of the best thoroughbreds ever to grace a racetrack			2
sent off at odds as short of 1 - 4 -- meaning a $ 4 bet would earn you just $ 1 -- the undefeated son of @entity64 was always going to have to be at this best to overcome a field that included @entity67 's improving colt @entity66 ( who surely would be considered a superstar in his own right had he not had the misfortune to be racing in the same era as @entity28 )			1
as expected , the pacemaker @entity74 ( a half - brother to @entity28 ) set a strong early gallop , with @entity28 tucked in second place			2
all - devouring stride but when @entity48 pulled the pin with three furlongs to go , it felt more like a coronation than a contest , @entity28 's all devouring stride putting more and more distance between him and a somewhat subdued @entity66 , who finished five lengths back			1
the victory means @entity28 extends his unbeaten run to 10 from 10			1
his next appearance is likely to be the @entity88 at @entity89 , when he will face some of the best milers in @entity91			0
after that , @entity36 has indicated a step up in trip will be the next logical step , to see if @entity28 can reproduce his devastating form over distances of up to a mile and a half			0
such is @entity28 's superiority over his rivals that @entity48 rarely has to ask him to hit top speed ( indeed , far more familiar is the sight of the hulking colt taking a strong hold as @entity48 tries to restrain him )			0
the result is the @entity28 has not run a race to trouble the handicappers since his devastating performance in the @entity110 last year			2
in spite of that , @entity28 has a @entity114 rating of 143 , the third - highest of all time , behind the great @entity116 ( 145 ) and brigadier general and @entity118 ( both on 144 )			1
@entity121 showdown ? is there a horse in the world who can push @entity28 to the kind of performance that would see him take his rightful place at the top of the all - time list ? an @entity132 mare by the name of @entity121 may have something to say about that			1
she will also be at @entity89 , although she will run in the sprinter 's @entity137			0
such is the clamor in the racing world for a @entity143 showdown , billionaire owner @entity139 has offered a purse of $ 1.6 million if they both line up for the @entity146 at @entity147 , a race that @entity28 won last year			1
@entity36 has indicated he would love to see the two best horses in the world face each other , although @entity121 's trainer , @entity152 , remains cautious about exposing his mare over @entity28 's preferred distance of a mile on the undulating @entity147 track			1
whether or not the equine ' battle of the sexes ' ever materializes , the racing world has one more season to savor the exploits of the giant bay with the white star before his career follows its inevitable trajectory towards the breeding shed			0
a horse like @entity28 does n't come along every day			0
enjoy him while you can .			0

@entity28 races to 10th *win* in 10 races with victory at @entity35
@entity174 by five lengths
four - year - old @entity177 rated one of the great racehorses of all time
clamor for head to head with @entity132 champion @entity121
