-- if you 've been dreaming of your own scrambler phone since watching @entity5 movies as a kid , your time has come			2
as more business is done by email and more sensitive personal data is passed by phone , the demand for secure communication is growing			1
employers ca n't always stop staff using their own insecure laptops for work and many of us are asked to provide a credit card number over the phone on a weekly basis			1
governments want to know who we 're talking to and marketing firms make it their business to know			0
enter stage left a veteran of internet privacy			0
@entity30 is known for inventing the standard in email encryption -- @entity33 ( @entity33 ) -- in the 1990s and for giving it away to the world for free , much to the annoyance of the @entity37 government , which considered encryption software to be weaponry at the time and therefore restricted for export			1
now he has a new bag of tricks which , from next month , will allow customers to scramble their mobile phone calls , text messages , emails and even video calls			1
his company @entity50 has a suite of four products that go live on september 17 , and will be available to download worldwide to @entity53 , @entity54 , desktops and laptops			1
@entity50 's chief operating officer @entity57 is one of two former @entity58 working with @entity30 and @entity60 co-founder @entity59			1
he says one of the driving forces for establishing the firm was @entity37 armed forces personnel not being able to make secure calls home when posted overseas			1
" with 25 years in the @entity65 , i know all about that , " he said			0
" it 's very difficult to take care of your personal business			2
" the software is for use over a private network , subscription to which costs $ 20 a month			2
this is because the encryption works on a peer - to - peer basis , so both parties ideally need to be within the system			2
it still works if only one person uses the app , but in that case a message will only be scrambled as far as @entity50 's servers			1
once downloaded , the software generates a code that scrambles messages on that device			2
the code is used only once and then destroyed			0
if , say , someone steals your laptop and somehow breaks the code , they still ca n't read your other messages			0
from nabbing data from open @entity101 networks as people send crucial emails in airports , to planting a virus that captures every keystroke as you enter your passwords , industrial espionage has become almost easy			0
" we have a fashion designer who sends her designs to her production facility in @entity113 , " says @entity57			0
" before the first template 's come out , it 's already been sold in @entity116 or @entity117			2
" see also : 3 - d printing -- the shape of things to come another customer is a @entity123 bank , @entity57 , says , which wants to offer secure lines to its customers so that it is n't liable for their account data being disclosed over the phone if it gets into the wrong hands			2
@entity50 , itself based in @entity135 , in @entity136 , and in @entity137 , has located its servers in @entity123 because it feels the country has superior privacy laws			1
governments around the world have various regulations allowing government agencies to look at certain private electronic communications			0
@entity146 , the head of @entity148 spy network @entity147 , recently defended proposals allowing greater surveillance of internet use , saying it was needed to keep pace with criminals and terrorists adopting new communications technology			0
but growing government surveillance has raised privacy concerns			0
@entity33 was originally designed as a human - rights tool and civil liberties groups are likely to welcome @entity50 as a boon for @entity163 - era democracy campaigns			1
@entity164 , head of research for privacy campaign group @entity166 , in @entity168 , said he expected the product to be genuinely secure and easy to use			1
" @entity30 and his team have pedigree in this field , so this is probably good news for anyone that values their privacy -- from businessmen in @entity168 to human rights defenders in @entity179 , " he said			1
he added , however , that he awaited independent reviews of the service			0
@entity30 has always felt strongly about the right to private communication in the digital age and feels that it should be simple -- you dial a number and no one else can listen ; you should n't have to be a rocket scientist to make your conversations secure			1
" i should be able to whisper in your ear , even if your ear is a thousand miles away , " he said in a promotional video for @entity50			1
@entity57 said the company had received interest in its products " from @entity197 to @entity198 , from the @entity199 to @entity200			0
" he added that he expected some governments would be concerned about their citizens keeping their communications private			0
" they would have to block the website -- but that would be good marketing for the service , " he joked .			0

@entity50 encryption software will be available for phones and *computers*
secure calls for *military* personnel serving overseas was one driver for the product
it 's the work of @entity30 , who came up with @entity33 ( @entity33 )
