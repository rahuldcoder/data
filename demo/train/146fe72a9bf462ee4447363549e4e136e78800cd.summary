sunday 's action in football 's @entity2 failed to match the @entity5 goal-fest but that did n't mean there was a shortage of drama			1
most of it took place in @entity13 , with surging defending champion @entity14 coming unstuck against relegation threatened @entity17			1
cruising with a 2 - 0 lead after 35 minutes , @entity14 relinquished two goals in the second half to only settle for a point			1
out went its nine - match winning streak			2
the second - half lapse meant @entity14 failed to close the gap to one point on leader @entity28 , which had earlier drawn 10 - man @entity31 1 - 1			1
the margin remains three points			0
@entity36 's men -- despite missing strikers @entity37 and @entity39 -- netted six goals in their last two matches and when the in - form @entity42 and holding midfielder @entity44 found the back of the net within 33 minutes , it appeared as if a landslide win was on the cards			1
but @entity14 relaxed and plucky @entity17 -- which has improved in the past two months -- pounced			1
@entity49 began the comeback in the 47th minute before @entity51 leveled past @entity52 in the 81st			0
" it was a big opportunity to get two more points , " @entity36 was quoted as saying by the @entity54			0
" everybody would think the game was over but i always say it is never over until the last minute			0
" the pitch was very heavy , two games in 48 hours , but we were winning 2 - 0			1
once it was 2 - 2 we did n't have the legs to score			1
we only had two shots after that			0
" we did n't play well in the second half			0
" @entity28 boss @entity68 was left bewildered with the officiating at @entity31 , feeling his team should have been awarded a penalty when @entity72 hit the ground under a challenge from @entity75 early in the second half with the score tied 1 - 1			1
no penalty was given and @entity72 was booked by @entity79			0
in recent weeks , allegations of diving have centered around @entity28 players @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
" i ca n't believe that the referee did n't give a penalty , " @entity68 told @entity87			0
" i can believe that @entity31 defended with everything they have -- good organization , good spirit , good solidarity between the players			1
" i can also understand the game that my players played			2
they tried to win , especially in the second half , when we had complete control			0
i can not understand such a big penalty ( decision )			0
or i understand ( it could be ) a consequence of something that looks like a campaign			0
" out of nothing , ( @entity110 manager ) @entity107 starts speaking about @entity28 players diving , and in another game it is another coach			2
" @entity28 bossed possession with 60 % of the ball but managed one shot on target , @entity119 's clinical finish in first - half injury time			1
@entity121 was sent off for the fourth - place @entity31 in the 88th minute , tripping @entity72 for a second yellow			1
@entity124 manager @entity123 was not happy , either , unimpressed with teams having to play two games in three days			2
such , however , is life over the festive period in @entity129			0
after @entity124 and @entity131 played to a 0 - 0 draw in @entity133 , he described the football as ugly			1
" the second half was a struggle , " the @entity135 told @entity136			0
" you can see the players ca n't recover in two days			0
it was an ugly match			0
" but @entity124 would have scored two or three goals in the first half if not for the heroics of @entity131 keeper @entity145			1
elsewhere , @entity146 rose into a tie on points with @entity31 after beating @entity110 2 - 1 on the road ; @entity150 heaped more pressure on @entity152 by topping @entity153 2 - 0 ; and draw specialist @entity155 could n't register a winner against @entity157 even though it played most of the second half with an extra man			1
their match concluded 0 - 0			0
@entity160 must have thought its troubles were over when it beat @entity155 two days ago , but @entity163 's @entity162 fell at home 1 - 0 to last - place @entity165 -- which had lost six straight			1
@entity166 , which sacked @entity167 on saturday , claimed a point after holding @entity169 to a 0 - 0 result			2
@entity169 -- owned by @entity172 's @entity171 -- held a 5 - 2 - 2 record at home while losing all nine of its road games			1
in the late kickoff , roller - coaster @entity177 beat @entity180 3 - 2 at home to hand the @entity180 a sixth loss in their last eight			1
struggling @entity184 hosts @entity185 on monday			0
no more epl for @entity186 @entity68 and @entity28 will no longer be calling upon @entity186			2
@entity28 announced late saturday that the @entity188 striker -- an $ 80 million flop for the @entity190 -- would be moving to @entity191 permanently following his loan move to the @entity194 giant			2
@entity186 scored only 20 goals in 110 league appearances for @entity28 in three years , although he won the @entity197 during that time			2
it followed a prolific spell in front of goal with @entity184			0
" @entity28 thanks @entity186 for his service during the past four seasons and wishes him the very best for the future , " a @entity28 statement said			2
@entity186 , according to reports , could be headed back to @entity208 in another loan move			0
the @entity211 winner first made a name for himself at the @entity188 club .			0

@entity14 blows two - goal lead at home and draws lowly @entity17 2 - 2
@entity28 had earlier drawn 10 - man @entity31 1 - 1 away from home
@entity14 could have cut @entity28 's *advantage* to one point atop @entity2 table
elsewhere , @entity124 and @entity131 played to a *goalless* draw
