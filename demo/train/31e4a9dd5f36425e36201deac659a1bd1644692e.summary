@entity0 , @entity1 -- in 1856 , @entity5 explorer @entity3 described @entity6 as a nation of poets			1
it may seem an unlikely moniker for a country that has since become defined by piracy , state collapse , and the many horrors unleashed by @entity15 -- the @entity17 extremists who control much of the country			0
but , much has changed since then			0
despite appearances , the country used to be one of @entity22 's most dynamic artistic enclaves , and much of the region 's cultural activity took place in @entity0 , the capital of @entity1 , the internationally unrecognized state that broke away from @entity6 in 1991			1
" @entity0 used to be the cultural hub for the @entity6 republic			1
there was a beautiful @entity32 - built theater ; also the main public library , at one time the biggest in @entity6 , " recalls @entity28 , who six years ago founded the @entity29			1
the theater and library , like much of @entity0 , was flattened during the civil war that preceded @entity6 's collapse and @entity1 's declaration of independence			1
now , @entity28 is hoping to restore some of what his country lost			2
" if at the end of the fair , we have one more reader , we have succeeded , " he says			2
the fair , which takes place during a week in august ( this year 's ended august 13 ) , has become one of the most anticipated literary events in @entity22			1
part book expo , part cultural festival ( poets , musicians and dancers are as popular as the author panels ) , the fair attracts a variety of local literary legends like @entity58 , widely considered the most famous living @entity6 poet			1
outside , the hundreds in attendance throng around stalls selling new books published by the likes of the @entity65 -- a publishing company run by @entity28 -- and second - hand tomes , all to meet demand in this literature - hungry city			0
the city 's dedication to the written word is particularly poignant , given that the @entity6 language did n't even have its own written alphabet until 1972			1
that year , @entity6 president @entity74 introduced a standard written version of the @entity6 language using @entity77 script			1
the @entity80 regime 's move -- driven by a 5 % literacy rate ( according to the @entity82 ) -- represented a new approach beyond the oral poetic tradition			0
" @entity86 workers were given three months to learn			0
anyone who failed was fired , " recalls @entity87 , an author , playwright and teacher of @entity6 at the @entity90 , who was a school principal at the time			1
as the campaign stretched from the cities to the towns to the smallest villages , he says teaching took place " wherever -- under trees , under walls , wherever there was shade			0
" @entity28 also considers that period fondly			0
" it was one of the best things that happened in @entity6 society , " he says			1
while the first books to be published in the new language were mostly textbooks , there was also a smattering of @entity113 classics , with " @entity114 , " " @entity115 , " and even @entity117 " appearing on book shelves , according to @entity118 , a @entity6 writer and teacher based in @entity120			1
the period also brought on new forms of @entity6 literature , alongside poetry			2
" modern trends started to emerge , including original fiction works , " recalls @entity125 , who was working with the @entity126			0
according to the @entity82 , the @entity6 literacy rates climbed to 55 % by the mid- 1970s			2
such progress was n't sustainable though , as civil war and drought ultimately split the country			0
by 1990 , literacy rates fell to 24 %			0
@entity28 recalls books being burned at his school library			0
the official excuse given , he says , was that they fostered colonial sentiment , but he reasons that it was because they underlined @entity1 's separateness			2
" it had been a flowering			0
but everything was killed , " he says			0
still , in the @entity6 diaspora aboad , a handful of authors , like @entity147 and @entity125 , did their best to uphold the literary traditions			1
now , with the help of writing and photography workshops held at the book fair , a new generation of young @entity6 writers will hopefully pick up the tradition			1
@entity147 points out that new books are again being translated into @entity6			2
@entity28 himself remains dedicated to his path : using the occasion of the 2014 fair to launch a new , permanent , @entity162 - funded cultural centre in @entity0			0
@entity1 's capital may yet reclaim its cultural - hub status			2
all it takes is a little imagination , which @entity28 has in spades .			0

@entity1 hosts one of the most anticipated book fair in @entity22
the literary tradition is new . @entity173 did n't have a standard alphabet until 1972
now , @entity6 authors are hoping to nurture a new generation of authors
