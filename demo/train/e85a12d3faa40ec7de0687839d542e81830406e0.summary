editor 's note : @entity3 , @entity4 's chief national correspondent and " @entity5 " host , examines the news made in sunday talk and offers up this monday morning crib sheet on what to watch this week in politics			1
please note that all quotes are from rush transcripts and are subject to change			2
if you 'd like to receive a sneak peek of next week 's news in your inbox every sunday , you can sign up for the " @entity19 newsletter " at http://www.cnn.com/profile / @entity4 's @entity3 looks back at sunday 's talk shows and what will make news in the coming week			1
( @entity4 ) -- and amid all the talk , there was notable silence : house speaker @entity26 decided not to appear on any of the sunday shows to defend herself after a rocky week			1
for @entity26 , last week included a concession that she had been briefed about the use of waterboarding back in 2003 and an accusation the @entity30 had deliberately misled her and @entity31 about @entity33 interrogation practices			1
health care , the economy and the path to a @entity38 comeback were also hot topics , not to mention the controversy over president @entity42 's commencement address at @entity43			1
with speaker @entity26 declining offers from " @entity5 " and others to answer questions on sunday , her @entity45 critics stepped into the vacuum -- with gusto			1
@entity26 's critics fire away " lying to the @entity31 is a crime			1
and if the speaker is accusing the @entity30 and other intelligence officials of lying or misleading the @entity31 , then she should come forward with evidence and turn that over to the @entity58 so they can be prosecuted			2
and if that 's not the case , i think she ought to apologize to our intelligence professionals around the world			1
" -- @entity67 minority leader @entity66 on @entity4 's " @entity5 " read more of @entity66 's comments " i think the reality here is that @entity26 has stepped in it big time			1
and she is now put the @entity71 in a position , where the question for me is , does the president support @entity26 's versions of what happened , or his @entity30 director 's versions of what happened			1
" -- @entity82 chair @entity81 on @entity84 's " @entity83 " for all the criticism of the @entity71 speaker , there was clearly little desire on the part of some republicans to seek an investigation that might damage @entity26 but would definitely put the spotlight on @entity94 administration officials and the interrogations of terror suspects			1
" i am less interested in investigating whether her memory is correct or she lied about it than i am in the policies that flow from the debate that we 're having			2
i am not one who thinks we ought to have truth commissions and all of the rest of it and keep looking backward			2
i agree with the president			2
we 've got enough on our plate , we need to look forward			2
" -- sen. @entity110 , @entity111 , on @entity113 's " @entity112 " @entity114 battle ahead one certain issue for this week is the president 's search for a @entity114 nominee			1
conservatives are putting pressure on leading republicans to prepare for a confirmation fight , and while the math overwhelmingly favors the @entity71 , the @entity38 leader @entity123 said it was too soon to rule out a filibuster , a tactic he condemned during @entity94 administration court debates			1
" i think it is way premature ... to be predicting what kind of procedural moves will be taken when we have n't even seen the nomination yet			2
" -- senate minority leader @entity123 on " @entity134 " @entity135 : help or hindrance ? former vice president @entity135 was not out on the sunday talk shows , but there was a lot of debate over whether he 's helping or hurting the @entity45 with his harsh criticisms of the @entity42 administration			1
the criticisms have been coming hard and fast ever since his first tv interview on " @entity5 " on march 15			2
read more about criticisms , reaction one of his staunch defenders was his daughter : " the future of the @entity45 is going to be built based on substance			1
and a key part of that substance is a strong national defense			2
the national security piece of it is one on which the [ former ] vice president has in fact been very effective in the debate over the last two weeks			2
not just in influencing public opinion but frankly influencing the @entity42 @entity67			1
" -- @entity45 strategist @entity161 on " @entity112 " read more of @entity161 's comments the latest on @entity163 the concept of @entity45 " influencing the @entity67 " relates to two recent dramatic reversals of policy : refusing to release additional photos of interrogations and considering trying @entity163 detainees in military commissions instead of civilian criminal courts			1
the debate on what to do with the detainees continued sunday : " they should be transferred to established criminal courts , courts that have been able to handle such cases			2
... we have the capacity			0
we have the prisons that can hold them			0
we have the finest system of justice in the world			0
let 's not make a new one up			1
" -- @entity190 executive director @entity189 on @entity191 ' " @entity188 " " the president has a tough job to do			0
and i think he is beginning to learn how difficult it is to govern			0
you know it 's one thing to campaign and to make statements			1
but when it comes to governing , there has to be much more pragmatic decisions			0
we 've seen the president make several of those lately			0
" -- @entity66 on " @entity5 " read more of @entity66 's comments on governing economy : hopeful signs ? with such dreadful economic news in the past year , people will take anything they can get			1
" i think what happened is the free - fall in the economy seems to have stopped			0
i guess the analogy [ is ] there are some glimmers of sun shining through the trees , but we 're not out of the woods yet			0
we do have more work ahead			0
" -- @entity224 , director of the @entity225 , on " @entity5 " president at @entity43 another big sunday story was @entity42 's commencement speech at @entity43 -- speaking directly to those who protested his presence at the @entity232 institution			1
" when we open our hearts and our minds to those who may not think like we do or believe what we do -- that 's when we discover at least the possibility of common ground			1
... that 's when we begin to say , ' maybe we wo n't agree on abortion , but we can still agree that this is a heart - wrenching decision for any woman to make , with both moral and spiritual dimensions			2
" -- @entity42 at @entity43			1
read more about @entity42 's visit on " @entity5 , " two political contributors , conservative radio talk show host @entity249 and @entity71 strategist @entity251 , had very different views of this event : @entity249 : yes , he should be welcome on the campus			1
yes , he should be able to come and express his views			0
should he receive an honor for his views ? no , he should not			0
when you go against fundamental moral principles , fundamentally teachings of the church , then you should not be honored			0
should there be a debate on campus on this as there can be , sure			0
@entity251 : if @entity43 is serious ... this is what they need to do : they need to get every member of the faculty , particularly the law school -- i understand that there are law school professors teaching at @entity43 that say @entity276 is set law			0
... why do n't they go through and see if their biology teacher -- see if anybody on that faculty is pro-choice ? @entity249 : missing the point			0
@entity251 : i 'm not missing the point			0
it 's much more relevant to a university what a teacher is teaching in the classroom than somebody gets an honorary degree			2
i know people who have gotten 40 honorary degrees			0
are you willing to have them go and make every law professor sign a statement saying that they overturn @entity276 ? how can you teach students that ? @entity249 : free inquiry at the university is entirely appropriate			0
but the point of honoring someone who is the most pro-abortion president for his life and his work is inappropriate			0
i have one of those honorary degrees from @entity43 , by the way			0
it ai n't worth much			0
on a lighter note minority leader @entity66 was the butt of one of president @entity42 's best lines at the recent press dinner : " in the next 100 days , our -- my partisan outreach will be so successful that even @entity66 will consider becoming a @entity320			1
after all , we have a lot in common			0
he is a person of color			0
although not a color that appears in the natural world			0
" -- president @entity42 @entity66 took the joke about his deep tan in stride : " you know , as i tell my friends , you only tease the ones you love			1
and , you know , if the president wants to go out and take a walk with me , as i do every day , or i walked 18 holes yesterday			0
last weekend i was in @entity338 cutting my grass , trimming my beds , i enjoy being outside			0
but i 'd rather be heckled than ignored			0
