@entity0 -- acknowledging it is out of the ordinary for city mayors to take a stand on military policy , the @entity2 passed a resolution monday calling for an early end to the conflicts in @entity11 and @entity12			1
" this is not a war resolution , " said the newly elected president of the group , @entity16 @entity15 mayor @entity13			2
" what we wanted to make clear , " he told reporters afterward , is that " the best way to support and honor those troops is to give them a job when they come back home			0
" the outgoing president of the @entity2 , @entity28 @entity27 of @entity29 , @entity30 , said the resolution is simply " calling on @entity32 to redirect military spending to domestic priorities			2
" but dissenting mayors said the resolution might send the wrong message , and one called for it to be withdrawn before the group could vote			2
@entity39 : getting out of @entity11 @entity40 , the nonpartisan mayor of @entity41 , @entity42 , told his colleagues that " making political statements in this forum about the war , i do not believe is proper			0
" the @entity2 last addressed @entity49 military policy when it called for an end to the @entity49 war in @entity52 , and some mayors expressed concern that the current resolution could be taken badly by the troops now deployed			1
" let 's not go and make the mistakes another generation did , " @entity40 said			0
" so i urge that this resolution be defeated			0
" other mayors pushed ahead , saying there are economic problems in the @entity49 with a more pressing priority than the massive spending on the conflicts in @entity11 and @entity12			1
" this one does not call for an immediate withdrawal , " said the @entity16 mayor of @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , " but it calls for speeding up the effort to end this war			0
" " we are at a point where municipalities are faced with cuts in services that affect all of our citizens , especially those that are in need the most , " he said			0
mayors then proposed and approved amendments changing the wording to express support for @entity49 troops and acknowledging what was called the need for a strategic , stable pullout of @entity49 forces			1
with those changes , the mayors then approved their resolution with a call to " bring these @entity49 war dollars home			1
" as read by the parliamentarian , this is the amended resolution passed by the @entity2 : calling on @entity32 to redirect military spending to domestic priorities -- whereas , every member of the @entity2 and the @entity49 they represent support our brave men and women and their families ; and -- whereas , the drawdown of troops should be done in a measured way that does not destabilize the region and that can accelerate the transfer of responsibility to regional authorities ; and -- whereas , the severity of the ongoing economic crisis has created budget shortfalls at all levels of government and requires us to re-examine our national spending priorities ; and -- whereas , the people of the @entity49 are collectively paying approximately $ 126 billion per year to wage war in @entity12 and @entity11 ; and -- whereas , 6,024 members of the @entity49 armed forces have died in these wars ; and at least 120,000 civilians have been killed in @entity12 and @entity11 since the coalition attacks began			1
-- now , therefore , be it resolved , that the @entity2 supports efforts to speed up the ending of these wars ; and -- be it further resolved , that the @entity2 calls on the president and the @entity32 to end these wars as soon as strategically possible and to bring these war dollars home to meet vital human needs , promote job creation , rebuild our infrastructure , aid municipal and state governments , and develop a new economy based upon renewable , sustainable energy .			0
