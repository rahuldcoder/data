-- a five - eyed monster under the bed is n't what worries most kids			0
experts say young people fear a lot of what 's in the news -- from kidnappings to murders to salmonella			1
it 's good for teens to fear the negative consequences of risky behavior , one expert says			1
a study on more than 1,000 children and adolescents in grades 2 through 12 found that some of the 20 most common fears include " terrorist attacks , " " having to fight in a war , " " drive - by shootings , " " tornadoes / hurricanes " and " drowning / swimming in deep water , " based on self - reports of how scary each of 98 events or concepts seems			1
the study was published in a recent issue of the @entity36			2
study author @entity37 , associate professor at the @entity38 in @entity39 , collected data from november 2001 to april 2004 in 23 schools in two southeastern states			2
the most common fears closely aligned with those found in previous studies on youth , and the pattern of findings has persisted in studies on fear for the past 30 years , she said			1
by 8 years old , children know the difference between fantasy and reality , so they are more likely to be frightened by televised news coverage of events such as kidnappings , murders and terrorism , said @entity60 , professor of at @entity61 , who was not involved with the study			1
before age 8 , they express fears of fictional scenarios and characters but also worry about hurricanes and drowning , she said			2
a lot of children 's fears have to do with where they live , said @entity76 , a psychologist in @entity77 , @entity78 , who was not involved with the study			1
in the @entity82 , @entity78 , area , many children express fears of tornadoes , she said , prompted by the storm that sliced through the city march 14 , 2008			1
@entity87 , a psychologist in @entity88 , @entity89 , who sees children ages 6 to 12 , agreed that weather - related events make some kids anxious to the point that they do n't want to go outside if a storm may be coming			1
several psychologists agreed that abduction or kidnapping is a fear among many children today			1
one of @entity76 's patients became terrified of kidnapping after learning about slain @entity104 toddler @entity102 , she said			0
in a separate analysis , when @entity108 looked at data on fear by age , she found aids among the top five fears for ages 7 to 10 , 11 to 14 , and 15 to 18			1
complexity of teenage fears two of the top fears in @entity108 's study -- " being raped " was no. 1 overall and " my getting pregnant or getting my girlfriend pregnant " was no. 19 -- were presented only for students in grades 7 through 12 because of fear content , the study said			1
the teenage years are also when young people begin to understand and fear larger world issues such as terrorism and war , @entity60 said			1
moreover , some teenagers become anxious about issues of global injustice but have the same divorce - related fears as young children , said @entity136 , professor of applied psychology at @entity138			1
moreover , young people are not immune to fears about finances during the current economic downturn , he said			1
" almost everyone is affected by it , and there might be a fear that they 're going to lose their house or that their parents are going to lose their jobs , " he said			0
some fears have a good role to play in helping to promote caution , @entity76 said			1
the negative consequences of risky behaviors -- for example , getting sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant -- should make teenagers wary of taking unnecessary risks			0
@entity108 agreed that fear , like anxiety , can be a motivating tool			0
" it is a natural process that occurs , and we all have fear , " she said in an e-mail			0
" however , if it rules someone 's life , it gets in the way , and that would be the unhealthy side			0
" about 400 study participants also wrote their own ideas about what makes them or people their age afraid , scared or fearful			2
responses included safety issues such as " abuse , " " scary movies and scary characters from movies , " " snipers at school , " " heights " and " driving			0
" other self - reported fears related to animals or reptiles , spiritual or religious concerns , school , people ( such as " clowns " ) , death , relational issues or social adjustment , sex - related issues and health or medical issues			2
movies and television , including news , can inspire fears that can last for years , said @entity60 , who runs the web site yourmindonmedia.com			2
clowns , for example , inspire fear because of their presence in film			0
" i 've got lots of examples from research where college students and older say , ' i feel uncomfortable in a certain situation , and i trace it back to news or movie , ' " she said			0
how parents can help many experts said parents should limit their elementary - school - age children 's exposure to local news to reduce anxiety about tragic events depicted on television			1
young children do not understand that when a news clip about an event such as a kidnapping is repeated , it is not a separate instance of a kidnapping , @entity87 said			1
children should seek counseling when anxiety leads to sleep disruption or difficulty falling asleep , @entity76 said			0
they may also present physical symptoms , such as stomach pain and headaches , that relate to anxiety problems			0
" by definition , anxiety is being afraid without really having a target to the fear , " she said			0
" there 's a difference between being anxious and being cautious			0
" parents should not tell children that events such as kidnappings and murders could absolutely never happen , because the children wo n't believe that , @entity76 said			2
instead , parents should focus on the probabilities , she said			0
" the parents need to tell kids that the chances are very , very remote that these things are going to happen , " she said			0
when a disaster strikes , do n't show it to young children on television , @entity136 said			2
instead , assure them that the grownups are doing everything possible to make things ok			0
" allow them to talk about their concerns ; do n't trivialize and make believe that nothing is wrong , " he said .			0
