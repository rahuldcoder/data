@entity0 the strategy behind president @entity5 's @entity4 trip			1
race and the @entity8 speech			2
sen. @entity11 's big money goal			2
how @entity14 's new team compares with her 2008 staff			1
these are all the hot topics around the " @entity18 " table this week : president @entity5 says he 's on the offensive , and he has certainly unveiled an ambitious list of proposals in the weeks leading up to the @entity8 speech tuesday night			1
but @entity24 of @entity25 notes that his schedule contradicts his rhetoric as he crosses into one of the indisputable stages of a lame - duck presidency : nonessential foreign travel			0
" he 's going to @entity4 basically for a parade and a visit to the @entity34 , " said @entity24			2
" think about the timing of this			0
the president is going to @entity4 three days after his @entity8 address			0
a period of time when he normally would be out trying to rally @entity41 and the public behind his agenda			0
i think this says all you need to know about the likelihood that anything he announces on tuesday actually gets done			0
" what will @entity5 say about race and policing in the sotu ? @entity54 of the @entity55 points out the issue has receded from the national conversation even as attorney general @entity58 has been taking the @entity60 's message on increasing trust between law enforcement and communities around the country			1
and members of the @entity66 , while celebrating @entity68 's legacy in @entity69 this weekend , are also pressing the president to include funding for body cameras in his annual budget			1
" a lot of people waiting to see what the president will say , if anything , about race and policing on tuesday , " @entity74 said			0
on friday , former @entity82 gov. @entity10 said he 's " seriously considering " a 2016 presidential run but did n't reveal any more details about his plans			1
but the @entity55 's @entity86 says @entity10 watchers might be getting additional information on monday , when he is scheduled to give a paid speech -- with a q&a scheduled -- to a corporate audience			1
" this is his first public appearance since he spoke at the @entity93 on friday , " said @entity86			0
" and we 're really going to have to see how much farther is @entity10 going to move ? is he going to send some more signals about his message and his pitch should he run for president ? " @entity100 gov. @entity99 might be telling republicans to " relax " about the race for the @entity60 , but sen. @entity11 wants the @entity101 to get serious --- about his candidacy			1
@entity1 's @entity104 reports that @entity11 had a meeting with some of his top donors about a week ago in @entity107 and told them : " in the first quarter of this year , i 'm going to raise half a million dollars , go to early states , and see if there 's a space for me in this field			0
" while @entity11 's candidacy might end up being more of an issue - driven campaign rather than a serious bid for the nation 's top office , his run might cause some trouble for other candidates in an important early contest			0
" if he does run , remember @entity107 is an early primary state and that would put a lot of his top donors and operatives in a pickle because usually they have their choice of candidates to support , " said @entity104			0
" but if their hometown guy runs for president , they 're going to have a choice to make			0
" it has been more than a month now since @entity14 held a public event , but that does n't mean she is taking a break from politics			1
as has been widely reported , the former secretary of state is building a 2016 campaign team that looks very different from her 2008 high command			2
her husband 's former chief of staff -- @entity147 -- is leaving the @entity5 @entity60 to lead " @entity148			1
" and two veterans of the 2008 and 2012 @entity5 campaigns will serve as @entity152 's top strategist and chief media adviser			1
the biggest question is whether @entity152 has been using this down time to hone her campaign rationale -- to answer liberal critics who say she is too cozy with @entity159 or @entity93 critics who label her more about the past than the future			0
but while awaiting her return to the public stage on wednesday , even senior @entity101 -- and those @entity167 pushing to draft @entity168 -- concede her 2016 staff recruits are top notch .			2

what 's the thinking behind president @entity5 's " @entity174 " ?
@entity10 's next step is a corporate speech -- with a q&a
what @entity14 's new team says about her 2016 strategy
