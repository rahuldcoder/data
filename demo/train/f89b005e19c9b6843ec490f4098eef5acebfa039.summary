-- @entity1 was in danger of becoming the forgotten man of @entity5 cricket			1
shunned by the selectors after an alarming loss of form , he spent a year out of the test team as he struggled to overcome a foot injury			2
but the 31 - year - old is back with a bang , having terrorized @entity14 's batsmen to help the home side clinch a 2 - 0 series win in @entity17 on friday			1
the left - arm paceman was named man of the match after claiming six wickets and scoring 92 not out as the tourists crumbled to defeat by an innings and 201 runs -- @entity14 's third worst reverse in the five - day game			1
@entity1 , only playing because of injuries to other bowlers , followed up his four - wicket haul from @entity14 's first - innings 156 with a fiery spell that earned two more scalps and ended the tour of key batsman @entity34 , who had scored 27			1
@entity34 , who on the opening day joined the elite club of players to have scored 10,000 @entity38 runs , needs surgery on a broken finger after being hit on the gloves by @entity1 -- who also gave wicketkeeper @entity42 a hairline thumb fracture in the first innings			1
neither @entity42 nor bowler @entity45 were able to bat due to injuries , and @entity14 collapsed to 103 - 7 all out in 24.2 overs			1
two wickets fell in @entity1 's opening over of the innings , one of them a run out			1
" the plan through this test match was to get up their batters and unfortunately for them they got a few injuries out of it , " said @entity1 , who passed the milestone of 200 wickets in his 49th test			1
" i think that intimidation factor definitely worked out there today			0
we found a bit of a weakness with them with the short ball ... they obviously did n't handle it as well as they would have liked			0
" it marked a minor career resurrection for @entity1 , who was @entity77 's main strike bowler until his form fell apart during the @entity79 against @entity80			1
" in the time i 've had off i 've been able to reflect on a lot of things			0
i had probably got to the stage where i listened to a lot of outside influences -- that does n't affect me anymore			0
i 'm just happy with how i 've come back , and making the most of the opportunities i get , " he said			0
" it 's not every day you get to play for your country , and i 'm pretty proud of the fact i 've played 49 tests now			0
you 've just got to look to the future and , if you get picked , go out there and make the most of it			0
that 's what i 'm doing ... and playing with a smile on my face			0
" i 've always been happy playing for @entity77 , it just got to the point where i was feeling the pressure			2
it happens in professional sports , you can feel the pressure and start to believe in things that are said or outside influences , and it just got to that point for me			0
" i 've moved past that			0
i 'm 31 , i 've been around the game for a long time now and i think i 've matured in that i have belief in myself and just go out there and play my game and do the best job i can			0
" despite his heroics , @entity1 is not guaranteed of starting the third test in @entity120 from january 3 - 7			1
@entity121 is expected to return after being rested , while debutant @entity122 made a strong impression as an opening bowler , taking two wickets in each innings			1
" his control with the new ball is an area that i think we 've been looking for , " captain @entity127 said			0
" the one thing i really like about @entity122 is you know what you 're going to get			0
" he bowled into the breeze the whole game and did a fantastic job for us			0
i think @entity140 played a huge part in @entity143 's success in the first innings , and it allows a bowler like @entity143 to be able to attack			2
" @entity77 will be without key all - rounder @entity147 , who has a calf injury , meaning @entity149 has the chance to make his test debut after previous appearances in limited - overs internationals			1
meanwhile , @entity154 leveled the @entity156 series against @entity157 with an 11 - run victory in the second match at @entity160 on friday			1
the home side put on 192 - 5 after batting first , with @entity162 smashing 72 off 36 balls , sending seven deliveries over the boundary ropes			2
@entity157 could not follow up tuesday 's five - wicket win in @entity167 , finishing on 181 - 7 after 20 overs			1
@entity169 took 3 - 36 from his four overs			2
it is the first bilateral series between the neighboring countries in five years			2
the three - match one - day series will start on sunday .			2
