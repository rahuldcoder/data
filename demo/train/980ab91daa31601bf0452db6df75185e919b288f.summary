-- despite complaints by some owners about underwhelming battery life , the @entity1 scored " very well " in tests of its battery performance by @entity8 , which gave the device its official blessing tuesday			1
@entity8 ' laboratory tests also determined that @entity13 's new phone does n't suffer the " death grip " reception problem that was found in its predecessor , the nearly identical - looking @entity16			1
that antenna flaw , which depleted signal strength when the user held the phone a certain way , led @entity8 to not recommend the @entity16			1
" overall , the new @entity1 scores higher in the ratings than the @entity16 , thanks to such enhancements as an upgraded camera , a faster " dual - core " processor , and the addition of the intriguing @entity35 voice - activated feature ... " wrote @entity23 in a post on @entity8 ' site			1
those upgrades were not enough , however , to let the @entity1 outscore the best new @entity38 - based phones in @entity8 ' ratings			2
those top - rated models included the @entity42 phones , the @entity43 and several other phones that boast larger displays than the @entity1 and run on faster networks			0
battery life has been an issue for the @entity1 since it went on sale october 14			1
according to @entity13 's official specs , the phone should have enough juice in its battery for up to eight hours of talk time , six hours of internet surfing , 10 hours of video viewing and 200 hours on standby			0
( all of these activities are on a @entity59 connection ; @entity60 and @entity61 produce different figures )			0
but online forums soon filled with complaints from users saying their new iphones were n't lasting even close to that long			0
on november 2 @entity13 acknowledged it had found a " few bugs " affecting battery life on the @entity1 and other devices running its new operating system			2
the company said a software update coming " in a few weeks " will address the problem			0
@entity8 said it plans to retest the phone after the software update to see if the fix affects battery performance .			0
