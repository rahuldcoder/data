-- if you 're looking for a harbinger of the zombie apocalypse , look no further than all those people on the street pecking at their tiny , handheld windows into a private world			2
so say a good portion of the commenters reacting to a semi-satirical article by comedian - columnist @entity11 , who noted the difficulty he had spending a day without a cell phone			1
it had become something bordering an addiction , he said , or at least a strong habit			2
some readers were taken aback			1
" the boy needs to get a life , " said commenter realworldaddict , who also wrote , " @entity21 to him and all the rest of the people walking around like zombies watching for messages on their cellphones : wake up and pay attention to the world around you			2
nobody is trying to contact you 24/7 , and did you really want to know that one of your 568 ' friends ' on @entity37 just got a new goldfish ? " perhaps we 're all shambling through daily life			2
when @entity42 mentioned a desire to keep a cell phone because it serves as a " safety crutch , " the discussion turned to self - sufficiency and even dystopian scenarios			1
" when the apocalypse hits in december , you will be one of the first ones to go , " replied a commenter			2
" you have become too reliant on technology			2
you are afraid of breaking down and not having @entity52 to save you			2
you better toughen up and learn to work on your own car , or you will perish very quickly			2
" maybe they 're taking a page from @entity57 's novel , " cell , " in which the protagonist , @entity59 , does n't turn into a zombie because he does n't own a cell phone			1
the story is about an event called " @entity64 " that turns cell phone users into vicious , mindless beings			1
the ill effects of omnipresent communication are a common motif in science fiction			2
despite the anxiety , mobile devices are big business			1
@entity74 has recently sold millions of its @entity76 devices , and there are many people who believe that smartphones and tablets can almost give us superhuman abilities			1
but their omnipresence in daily life has not been without controversy , raising concerns that our lives will be forever changed by this technology -- and not in a good way			0
commenter @entity91 called getting rid of his cell phone after the contract expired " one of the most liberating experiences i 've ever had , " and said he 's beginning to notice the walking dead all around him			1
" now it seems really weird to me when i am in a doctor 's office or subway and i see 95 % of the people around me glued to their phones , clicking away like zombies , " he said			1
" my favorite is when you go out with a group of friends and everybody at the table is just playing with their phones instead enjoying themselves with real live people			1
" indeed , dozens of commenters asserted that they do n't own a mobile phone , or have stopped using them			1
some say the tight economy has given them extra incentive			0
that 's the case with commenter wordswords , who says that in real life , he is the patriarch of the @entity123 family of @entity124 , @entity125			1
he and his wife have six children , and that means a lot of phone bills if each family member has their own phone			1
" i gave up my cell phone about two years ago , " words commented			1
" i made a commitment to saving money and our family went back to a single land line			0
since then i estimate we 've saved around $ 4,000			0
and we have n't lost or damaged a phone since ! " after the economy went downhill , the family had lost income and needed to cut down their bills			1
words said getting rid of eight cell phones " cold turkey , " a phrase often used in connection with addiction , has been a worthwhile decision			1
" the kids all hate me , but they enjoy the roof over their heads and the food on their table , " words said			0
" my two eldest have jobs and did get their own , but hey , as long as they 're paying for it themselves , i 'm all for it			0
" since they are a large family , the @entity123 upgraded to two phone lines to ease the strain			1
the family still keeps their disconnected smartphones to use with @entity170 connections while traveling on vacations , which @entity123 said is a luxury they now can afford			0
there are other benefits , too			0
" the constant ' ding ' of texting is gone , so we communicate with words and in person like a family should , instead of with words on a phone , " he said			1
others do n't understand us , but that 's all right			1
" expense was a great motivator for aspiring musician and aspiring writer @entity190 , 31 , of @entity191 , @entity192 , who decided that he had to focus on what was really important in life			0
" do the math. i simply can not afford a cell phone contract , and it does not give me functionality that i absolutely need in my life in order to stay reasonably connected with people or be functional , " @entity190 said			1
" my little brother who lives out of state has one , and i 've tooled around with it extensively			0
i think they are amazing pieces of technology , and i can see how they enhance people 's lives			1
they are ' @entity211 ' technology -- literally -- today and in the palm of your hand			0
i just ca n't afford one , and prefer to do my computing on a pc			0
" going without a cell phone can even be a game or a goal			1
commenter @entity220 said he is trying to see how long he can go without having a cell phone			1
he has never had one , and compares the challenge of stopping the use of such devices to " an addict going through heroin withdrawal			1
" he loves technology , but does n't want a cell phone			1
instead he uses @entity229 , a service that allows people to make phone calls over a data connection			1
" as i fast approach my 50th birthday , i am starting to feel like i am one of the lucky ones for not having ' plugged ' into the network , " he wrote			0
" like a smoker shortly after they quit , i can actually smell and taste the things that others can not enjoy			0
do n't get me wrong			0
i 'm a technology lover and it has been a genuine struggle not to give in to the temptation that these amazing devices create			2
however , just like when i did quit smoking , i think i 'll just focus on going one more day ' without ' to see if i can curb the craving			0
" still , he does n't think this will last forever			0
" eventually , however , i realize that society will evolve to a point where i likely wo n't have a choice but to adapt to the technology			0
but , until then , i 'll see just how long i can survive without this little mechanical addiction			0
" another reader , @entity254 , said she hates being tethered to a phone all day , and only keeps a phone for emergency cases			2
" i have n't bought a phone in 30 years , " she said			2
" i got a new hand - held 15 years ago free from @entity259			0
i recharge it once a year , whether it needs it or not			0
i pay $ 13 per month			0
" talking to " real living people " and enjoying the scenery of life is the real benefit to her			0
she does n't understand what is so important that it requires being on the phone while doing other things			2
sometimes , it 's hard to tell if people are mentally present or not			2
" when i was young , if you saw someone walking down the street talking to themselves you crossed over assuming they were crazy , " she said			0
" sometimes i think they still are			0
