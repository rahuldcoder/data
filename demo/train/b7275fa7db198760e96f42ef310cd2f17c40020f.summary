@entity0 -- @entity3 police charged a @entity5 man tuesday in connection with the defacement over the weekend of a painting by famed artist @entity9 at a @entity0 museum			1
@entity12 , 26 , will appear in a south @entity0 court wednesday on one count of criminal damage in excess of Â £ 5,000 ( about $ 8,000 ) , @entity0 's @entity11 said			1

he was arrested late monday in @entity20 , on @entity22 's south coast			0
the painting -- part of @entity9 's @entity26 mural series -- was hanging at @entity0 's @entity28 museum when a man began tagging the canvas with black paint sunday afternoon			1

@entity9 , a @entity36 - @entity35 abstract expressionist , was commissioned to do a series of paintings for the @entity40 restaurant of the @entity26 building in @entity42 in 1958			2
