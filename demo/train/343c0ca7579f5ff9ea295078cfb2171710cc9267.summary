to channel his inner child @entity108 , a chef in @entity109 , @entity110 , played with @entity111 as a child and forgot about them until he started helping his son build sets people had given him			1

the @entity262 native attaches the tree with eye bolts and uses a staple gun to get the gift bags and presents to stay			0
