-- pigeons and mole rats are some of the stars of his stories			2
to a nation of toddlers , they are heroes			2
children 's author @entity9 has written more than 40 books , and he 's at it again			1
@entity12 , who started as a writer and animator on " @entity15 , " draws animals who are n't usually associated with starring roles			1
he depicts deep desires that he says all children -- and adults -- share			2
in " @entity23 ! " a bird pleads with readers to let him steer when a bus driver takes a break			1
his latest star is a fat goose in a story called " that is not a @entity36 ! " which also features a fox and a big bowl of soup			1
@entity12 is a novelty in his industry because he illustrates most of the stories he writes			1
many of his books are fixtures on the shelves of children ages 5 and under			1
his name appears often on @entity49 best - seller lists of children 's picture books			1
young readers might also be familiar with the misadventures of @entity54 , a stuffed animal who is loved and lost in a series of books			1
like all of @entity12 ' protagonists , the bunny is easy for young fans to draw			1
@entity12 , who lives in @entity62 , welcomes his fans ' attempts to doodle their own versions of his characters			1
he told @entity0 how he creates classic children 's tales from a garden of ideas , and encourages copyright infringement from his young fans			1
below is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : how did you come up with the notion that every 2 - year - old wants to drive a bus ? @entity12 : if you had an opportunity to drive a bus , would you do that ? i mean , it 's primal			1
have you ever walked by a bus and the bus driver is n't in it ? i mean you really have to pull all of your power not to just jump in			1
we do n't go , because we know we 're going to get arrested , or we 'll be late for work , and it 'll be bad on our credit score			2
but if all that stuff disappeared , and you walked by a running bus without a driver in it , you would get in that bus			1
@entity0 : have you seen some of your fans drawing the pigeon ? @entity12 : oh yes			1
i get a box every month filled with ( letters from ) kids infringing on my copyright			1
it is a legalistic nightmare , and a complete joy			2
and i post on my blog my favorites			2
but i just love it			2
i started out drawing @entity114 and @entity115			2
and then i would have my own characters interacting with them			1
when i start seeing kids draw their characters interacting with the pigeon , you see that the creative crutch is going away , and that they 're really becoming authors			1
for me , it 's so important to doodle and draw			1
in my house , every night at dinner we have a big piece of paper that we put on our dining room table as our tablecloth and we doodle			2
i fear that grownups just do n't doodle anymore			2
there is a day in everybody 's life when they realize that they 're not going to be a professional basketball player and they 're not going to be a professional cartoonist			2
it 's usually the same week			2
but people keep playing basketball			0
and i just think that that 's such a waste			0
@entity0 : what inspires you ? @entity12 : i 'm very lucky to write for children , because i do n't have to deal with popular culture			1
i can just deal with core fundamental issues : jealousy , love , hatred , sadness , joy , wanting to drive a bus			1
the fundamental core emotional things			0
and just asking questions like , ' how do you know when you 're in control ? what is a friend ? what are relationships between people ? ' these are all things that i have n't figured out yet			0
i 'm very lucky in that i do n't understand the world yet			0
if i understood the world , it would be harder for me to write these books			1
@entity0 : how do you create a timeless tale ? @entity12 : that 's a tough question			1
besides dumb luck , i 'm not sure			0
i do have a couple of rules that i place for myself in my books			1
the first is a mantra , which is : always think of your audience , but never think for your audience			0
what that means is to leave it open to interpretation			0
i 'm not telling things , i 'm asking questions			0
and i 'm asking questions that i do n't necessarily have the answers to			0
the other formal thing that i do is that i make sure that the characters in my books -- in this ( ' that is not a @entity36 ! ' ) case , the chicks in particular -- are characters that a 4 - or a 5 - year - old can draw : infringe on my copyright with great ease			1
so a lot of my design work is reductive			0
i make drawings , then i try to take as many lines out , so that it 's at its easiest to copy			0
@entity0 : which comes first : the characters or the ideas ? @entity12 : it all depends			1
a lot of people think of ideas as objects , or animals that you hunt			0
you go into the woods , you find an idea , you capture it and you bring it home			0
and ideas really are more like gardens			0
and every day , you 're planting lots and lots of ideas			0
some of them get eaten by birds , and never go anywhere			0
some of them grow up to be really horrible things			0
every now and then , over time , some idea grows up to be big and beautiful and filled with fruit			0
you can cut that down and burn it for profit			0
so it 's an evolution			0
@entity0 : what was the inspiration for your latest book ? @entity12 : i think this one is about the question of : ' what is control ? ' and also about pacing , and suspense , and being helpless			1
in ' @entity23 ! ' you yell ' no ! ' and you change the situation			0
the pigeon does n't get to drive the bus because you yelled no. in this , you 're yelling , ' that 's not a good idea ! ' but it 's still going to happen			1
you 're seeing that truck wreck about to occur			0
it 's about trying to change the world , and maybe not being able to			0
i do n't know what it 's about			0
and you know what ? frankly , it 's not my job			0
my job is to make the book			2
you guys figure out the meaning			0
come back to me , you tell me what it 's about			0
@entity0 : what made you want to transition from television into writing children 's books ? @entity12 : books have a lot more space for the individual			1
i 'm very interested in things like failure , which most television executives do n't think is a theme that they want to have			0
and just on a technical level , my books can be small			2
a television is always the same size			0
i can be much more individual			0
