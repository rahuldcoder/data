-- president @entity1 looked uncomfortable as he stood before the nation on saturday , announcing that he would ask for a congressional resolution of support to use limited force in @entity6			1
@entity1 , who won the hearts and souls of many @entity9 in the 2008 election with his trenchant criticism of president @entity13 's war in @entity14 , now finds himself leading a controversial and ambiguous military operation that has little support , in @entity17 or abroad			1
asking @entity17 for a resolution of support is an important step in making this decision , but what will matter much more is how the operation unfolds			1
in the best - case scenario , limited air strikes would achieve their intended goals and the president could bring the operation to an swift end , shifting his focus back to domestic debates			1
presidents @entity32 and @entity34 , as well as @entity1 with @entity35 in 2011 , learned that in the modern era this outcome is possible			1
in the worst - case scenario , the situation will deteriorate and overshadow anything else			0
the violence in @entity6 could intensify , forcing the @entity9 to increase its presence and become embroiled in a deadly and costly war			1
@entity1 is not the first president to become involved in an international conflict that forces him to make decisions that fundamentally contradict what he hoped to stand for			1
@entity6 : who wants what after chemical weapons horror in 1917 , @entity51 sent @entity9 troops into @entity53 after having won the admiration of progressive activists during his successful run as a peace candidate the previous year			1
@entity53 proved to be highly controversial			0
@entity51 alienated progressives through his crackdown on anti-war movements and dismissal of civil liberties			0
the brutality of the war disillusioned many citizens and the rationale behind @entity9 involvement always remained unclear			2
the president 's inability to persuade the @entity70 to ratify the peace treaty ended his term in failure			1
in 1964 , @entity74 wanted to be the domestic president who finished the @entity76			2
@entity74 initially took a hawkish stand on @entity78 , with the intention of insulating himself from right - wing attacks about being weak on national security and with the hope of keeping the @entity9 out of a bigger war through firm action at the outset			2
he always feared suffering the fate of president @entity88 , whose political strength plummeted after @entity90 fell to communism in 1949 and the @entity9 became bogged down in a stalemate in @entity93			2
but @entity74 's strategy did n't work			2
the @entity78 continued to expand and gradually dwarfed @entity74 's huge domestic accomplishments			2
he found himself bogged down in a quagmire , much worse than @entity88			0
upon his election in 1976 , @entity97 promised to rebuild @entity9 's faith in government after @entity101 and @entity78			1
@entity97 promised to offer new approaches to domestic policy that avoided the militaristic record of his @entity106 predecessors			0
he promoted human rights as a centerpiece of international policy and signed the @entity112 treaties that he hoped would rebuild the image of the @entity9 in the region			0
@entity97 also continued to try to ease strained relations with the @entity116 , pushing for the ratification of the @entity119 arms agreements			0
but all of his efforts ended in november 1979 when @entity123 revolutionaries took @entity9 hostages			0
then the @entity116 invaded @entity125 in december 1980			0
@entity97 was forced to shift to the right by calling for increased troop presence in the @entity128 and higher defense spending among @entity131 allies			0
he disappointed @entity133 supporters , while never winning the backing of opponents who believed that he was a failed president			0
most recently , @entity13 found himself in a similar predicament			0
when @entity13 ran for office , evidence suggests he did n't want to become involved in prolonged and costly international operations			2
he had criticized @entity34 's " nation - building " efforts and said that the @entity9 had to be very restrained in using its military power			0
@entity13 was a politician who cared most about domestic policy			0
he wanted to re-energize the @entity145 around issues like education reform and the liberalization of immigration laws			0
but @entity150 changed everything , shifting the national agenda to foreign policy			0
@entity13 focused his efforts on fighting against @entity155 , and on a war in @entity125 to bring down the @entity158 regime that harbored terrorists			0
then , when he and his advisers decided to go to war in @entity14 , he moved on a path that would be disastrous			1
the war damaged his presidential legacy and eroded the positive feelings many @entity9 had developed about his leadership after the horrendous attacks on 9/11			2
then sen. @entity1 defeated sen. @entity168 in 2008 , due in large part to his outspoken opinions against the war -- both its faulty rationale and the way in which the president ignored @entity17 and international opinion			1
president @entity1 now finds himself at a potential crossroads			1
the initial rollout of this plan has been highly problematic			0
the administration has failed to build international support for this action and has offered a shifting set of reasons for using force , a strategy that has reminded many @entity9 of the buildup to @entity14			1
@entity1 , who has been such a strong supporter of congressional involvement , seemed to back into announcing that he would approach the @entity188 and @entity70 only when he had no other choice			1
even though an operation in @entity6 is unlikely to grow to the scale and scope of the bigger conflicts that the @entity9 has been through , it is crucial that @entity1 handle this situation in the right way , learning from the mistakes of his predecessors			1
he needs to provide the strongest possible evidence that @entity6 was responsible for the chemical weapons and make it clear to the public that he does have a plan about the mission in this war			1
so , what exactly are @entity1 's options on @entity6 ? he needs to marshal public support behind the operation without resorting to scare tactics			1
he needs to allow legislators to have a healthy debate on what to do , if there is no imminent threat			0
if he does , and the operation goes relatively well , @entity1 can come out of this predicament in relatively good shape and possibly complete work on issues like immigration reform			1
if he does n't , @entity1 knows that his presidency , and his party , will be paying the consequences for many years			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

president @entity1 won support in the 2008 election with his criticism of the war in @entity14
@entity1 is not the first president to become involved in a *difficult* international conflict
how the operation in @entity6 unfolds will affect @entity1 's legacy in the @entity188
