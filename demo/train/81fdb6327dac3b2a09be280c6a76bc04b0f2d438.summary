for @entity1 , time stopped on the evening of may 29 , 1985			1
he had taken his @entity3 - supporting daughter @entity2 to watch the @entity5 club play @entity7 team @entity6 in the @entity9 final in @entity10 at the @entity11			1
it should have been a time for celebration			0
father and daughter watching the most prestigious club game in @entity18 football in the traditional climax to the season			1
instead , @entity1 's memories of @entity22 are of mayhem and death			1
" it was 19:25 cet when everything happened , " @entity1 told @entity25			0
" when i woke up half an hour later i was among dead people , and at that moment i remembered where i was			2
" i looked for my daughter until i saw a shoe under a blanket and i understood that she was dead			0
" for the modern @entity18 football fan used to watching matches in bright , shiny all - seater stadiums , it is almost impossible to imagine attending a football game and dying there			2
but in the space of four years in the 1980s , nearly 200 people lost their lives in three horrific @entity18 stadium tragedies			1
first , on may 11 1985 , just over two weeks before the @entity22 stampede , came a devastating fire at the @entity44 on may 11 , and then there was a deadly crush at another @entity7 ground -- @entity48 -- in 1989			1
it is only in the last few months that @entity51 's political and civil institutions have begun to be held to account for the reasons behind the death of 96 people during an @entity56 match at @entity48 , which has long cast a shadow over the city of @entity6			2
four years earlier at @entity22 , @entity6 had been involved in another stadium tragedy as 39 fans -- 32 from @entity5 , four from @entity61 , two from @entity62 , one from @entity63 , the youngest just 11 years old -- were killed in a stampede before the @entity9 final against @entity3			1
" for me that cup will always be covered in death , " wrote @entity3 defender @entity66 in his autobiography " @entity68			1
" " the cup of death "			0
forgotten story @entity22 is a story of " incompetence , violence , cover - up , shame and lies , " writes professor @entity78 -- the author of the authoritative history of @entity5 football , " @entity81			1
" " it 's also a story of forgetting , " adds @entity82			0
" many people have an interest in not remembering what happened that night : the players , many fans , the @entity61 politicians and police forces			1
" foot 's analysis is shared by @entity94 , who lost her husband in the tragedy and whose 18 - year - old daughter was injured that night 27 years ago			2
" is there anyone who gives a damn ? " questioned @entity94			0
" news has to be on the front page , then everyone forgets			0
my daughter will carry that with her for her whole life			0
" i 'm happy that sometimes there is someone who remembers the tragedy			0
" many , many years have passed			0
people had forgotten soon after it happened , so now there 's no way			1
the 39 angels will always be in the memories of their loved ones			0
" journalist @entity118 was an @entity5 who cared , and in 2003 he wrote a book about the tragedy -- " the truths of @entity22 -- chronicle of a @entity124			1
" @entity118 was a friend of @entity125 , who was head of the now disbanded @entity126			0
@entity125 's son @entity127 was a doctor who died at @entity22			1
@entity127 had resuscitated a boy before being crushed to death , an act that saw him posthumously awarded a civic medal for his bravery			0
" before my book nobody had listened to the victims			2
it was the first chance that they had had to speak about the night of the heysel disaster , of the process and the battle for justice , " said @entity118			0
when @entity142 died in 1985 , his son @entity141 , who is now a sports journalist , was just three			1
" i 'm angry and bitter because it 's impossible to die for a football match , " said @entity141			0
" there is n't logic for what happened in @entity10			0
" sector z there are close parallels between @entity48 and @entity22 -- disasters waiting to happen at two dilapidated stadiums , which hosted major games with poor ticketing arrangements and " negligent policing			1
" @entity11 's @entity157 terrace had grass poking through the crumbling concrete			0
flimsy wire - netting separated the @entity6 and @entity3 fans while a minimal police force battled to keep control of thousands of fans			1
a police force whose walkie - talkies had no batteries			2
" i felt a lot of anger and bitterness towards @entity172 that allowed such an important match to be played in an inadequate stadium , " said @entity1			2
" the curved sector where we were should not have been open to the public , because it was n't up to hosting 15,000 people			2
" in that sector there were hooligans as well and the police were n't able to keep order			0
" then came the charge of the @entity6 fans			2
" there are dozens of points that are usually offered to explain the context , but the context does not begin to excuse anything , " writes @entity6 fan @entity184 , football editor of @entity51 newspaper @entity185			0
" no amount of context could			0
that stampede might have been considered standard terrace fare , a token act of territorialism and intimidation , but it led innocent fans to flee in terror			2
" some tried to climb a wall to escape			0
thirty - nine people were crushed to death			1
@entity6 and their supporters were left with the stigma and the stain			0
" with corpses lying in the stadium car park , @entity172 ordered the game to go ahead for the sake of public safety			2
@entity3 won the final 1 - 0 thanks to a penalty from @entity218 , who is now president of the @entity18 governing body			1
" i was at home watching the match on television , but i had the feeling that something terrible had happened to my loved ones , " said @entity94			0
" i spent the whole night at @entity226 waiting for them to come back			0
" @entity218 's celebration after scoring the penalty was widely criticized , though he justified playing the game by arguing that if it had not gone ahead , it " would have been the end of football			0
" another relative told @entity25 that @entity3 had always wanted to put a veil over @entity22 to forget this page in the club 's history and that the @entity241 side 's then president @entity239 should have handed the @entity9 back			1
@entity3 insist that the club has never forgotten the suffering of the family victims and that the disaster 's anniversary is always religiously marked			1
a commemorative monument was unveiled in the main courtyard of the club 's headquarters shortly after the disaster , and there was a dedication to the victims at the opening of @entity3 's new stadium last year			1
" the families of the victims are always welcome at the club , our museum and the stadium and they can come for free , " said a @entity3 spokeswoman			1
@entity6 also marks the anniversary of the tragedy , with flowers placed on the memorial plaque and flags flown at half - mast , while its website features stories of remembrance			2
the right punishments ? in the aftermath of @entity22 , then @entity172 president @entity274 and general secretary @entity275 were threatened with imprisonment , before being given conditional discharges			1
@entity279 , the former secretary - general of the @entity281 ( @entity281 ) and @entity282 -- who was in charge of policing the stands at @entity22 despite having never supervised a football match before -- were given six - month suspended prison sentences for negligence			1
" @entity22 is the tragedy of the century , " said @entity118			1
" @entity172 and @entity61 institutions are the guilty ones -- they chose that stadium and it was the worst stadium in @entity172 for a final of the @entity9			1
" @entity172 , the @entity61 institutions , @entity7 and @entity5 try to forget about it			1
they do n't care about the victims			2
it is only after @entity22 that @entity172 took responsibility for stadium safety			1
" @entity1 added : " the @entity5 state , the @entity300 and @entity3 took little interest in the case			1
" that critique of establishment inertia might strike a chord with those relatives of the @entity48 tragedy who have campaigned so tirelessly for the true story of their family members ' deaths to be told			2
in the aftermath of @entity22 , 25 @entity6 fans were subsequently extradited from the @entity51 and , after a five - month trial , 14 were found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in april 1989 -- the same month of the @entity48 disaster -- with each of them serving a year in jail @entity7 clubs were excluded from @entity172 for five years , with @entity6 handed an extra year 's ban			1
" the anger at the hooligans of @entity6 is still very strong , unspoken , but very strong , both among the relatives of the victims -- who know the history very well -- and especially among the @entity3 ' ultras ' -- who know it a little ' less well , ' " said @entity118 , before adding : " but everyone knows very well @entity172 and @entity61 institutions ' responsibilities			1
" lasting shadow last month the family of victims of the @entity48 disaster received an apology from @entity51 prime minister @entity337 for the long delay in giving answers to all those affected by " one of the greatest peacetime tragedies of the last century			1
" @entity337 's apology and the publication of an independent panel 's report revealing serious failings by police and emergency services was a major breakthrough for the @entity48 campaigners after their many years of battling to get to the truth			0
" i feel solidarity with the @entity48 victims -- only those who experienced it can understand , ' said @entity94			2
the truth about @entity48 might have taken 23 years to finally seep out but in the interim , @entity7 football fans saw vast improvements to the stadia in @entity7 as a direct result of the disaster			2
all - seater grounds in the top leagues were enforced on the back of recommendations made in lord @entity368 's report of 1989			2
no longer would fans go to a football match in fear of their lives			0
but was that the case in @entity5 ? @entity118 's concern is that stadium organization in @entity5 still remains a problem			0
' @entity5 has not learnt the lessons in the way @entity7 did , " he said			0
" @entity5 hooligans are very fascinated about @entity7 hooligans			0
it was the model for @entity5			0
@entity7 stadiums are really the best in the world , or most of them are			0
" we have not learnt the lessons of stadium safety and organization -- the @entity368 report is a totem for me			0
but it came after @entity48			0
why not after @entity22 ? "			1

nearly 200 people died in three horrific stadium tragedies in the 1980s
some say that the one at @entity22 in 1985 has been *largely* forgotten
thirty - nine fans died at the @entity61 stadium before @entity9 final
@entity3 insist the club still honors the relatives of @entity22 victims
