@entity0 -- the @entity5 government has lowered the threshold for information deemed important enough to put suspicious individuals on a watch list or no - fly list , or have their visa revoked , senior @entity3 officials tell @entity1			1
the government overhauled criteria it uses for putting possible terrorists on such lists as a result of the failed @entity17 attack , officials said			1
they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material @entity22 , the 23 - year - old @entity23 who allegedly launched the failed attack , was not put on a no - fly list			1
that 's because the information his father provided a @entity5 embassy about his son becoming radicalized and possibly going to @entity32 did not meet then - applicable standards to put him on such a list or to cancel his visa			2
" based on the criteria , he fell below the line and went into our database , but not a watch list or no - fly list , and his visa was n't revoked based on the analysis of the threat , " one senior official said			1
" we have a new standard now , which will allow us to capture more people			2
" under the new standard , officials said , @entity22 would have been put on a no - fly list and his visa likely would have been revoked			1
another official said that if all relevant agencies had the entire intelligence picture , including @entity53 ( @entity53 ) intercepts about a " @entity23 " possibly planning an attack against the @entity5 , @entity22 " would have absolutely been no - fly listed and his visa would have been revoked			1
" since the attempted attack , the intelligence community has scrubbed the entire @entity57 ( @entity57 ) database of more than 500,000 suspects with the new criteria , adding additional individuals to the @entity5 watch lists and no - fly lists as a result			1
several visas have also been revoked			2
" rest assured that in light of what happened on december 25 , we 've gone back over these databases and there have been additional actions taken , " assistant secretary @entity66 told reporters			0
he declined to provide statistics , saying the numbers were constantly changing			0
when discussing the new threshold , officials suggested it is more an art than science			0
" the threshold might be how much information do you have ? what kid of confidence do you have in the information that is available , " the first senior official said			0
" it will involve an assessment of risk , the perception of risk and our tolerance of risk			0
" but the officials suggested the new standard is much lower than before december 25			0
for example , decisions could be taken to put someone on a no - fly list or a watch list based on one credible source , instead of the previous standard of using multiple sources			1
" we had a new threat , and we are going to , for a period of time , tilt back to a more conservative approach , " the official said			0
officials recognize the costs for grounding more people and providing extra screening for passengers from specific countries , pointing to blowback from several countries who are protesting their inclusion on the list			2
@entity123 called in the head of the @entity5 @entity125 , and @entity23 called in the @entity5 ambassador to formally protest the move .			0
