-- former @entity2 head football coach @entity1 may have played a greater role than previously known in a decision made by university officials not to report a 2001 incident involving former coach @entity7 and a boy in a locker room shower , according to e-mails written by university officials			1
@entity0 does not have the e-mails , but the alleged contents were made available to @entity0			0
a jury last month convicted @entity7 , 68 , the @entity15 ' former defensive coordinator , on multiple charges of sexual abusing 10 boys over a period of 15 years			2
at @entity7 's trial , former @entity2 graduate assistant @entity20 testified he believed he saw sexual contact between @entity7 and a boy in the shower and told @entity1 in february 2001			1
disturbing e-mails could spell more trouble for @entity2 officials @entity1 , a revered @entity2 icon who died in january , testified before a grand jury that when he learned about the situation , he contacted his then - boss , athletic director @entity30 , as required and left it up to the university to investigate			1
in court documents , prosecutors state they have e-mails from university officials that allegedly contradict grand jury testimony of @entity30 and @entity2 vice president @entity38 , who oversaw campus police			1
the alleged e-mails , the contents of which were first reported by @entity0 , were among other documents , including a @entity7 file , discovered by @entity2 and turned over to state prosecutors as part of ongoing investigations , according to both @entity2 and prosecutors			1
one of the newly revealed alleged e-mails appears to show @entity1 had another , previously undisclosed conversation with @entity30 about the shower incident			1
on february 26 , @entity2 's vice president told @entity30 , the athletic director , to contact @entity7 , alert child welfare authorities and inform @entity56 , the charity @entity7 founded for disadvantaged children , a purported e-mail says			1
after @entity30 spoke with @entity1 , however , the athletic director allegedly told the school president that he had changed his mind about the best course to pursue			2
" after giving it more thought and talking it over with @entity1 yesterday -- i am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps , " he purportedly wrote the following day			2
instead of alerting authorities , @entity30 allegedly wrote , he would prefer meeting with @entity7 , telling him they knew about another incident in 1998 , and offering him professional help			2
he suggests notifying the @entity56 " at some point " if @entity7 is cooperative , and " maybe " child welfare officials			2
if @entity7 did not cooperate , @entity30 suggested notifying both @entity56 and child welfare			2
how the case unfolded how much the purported conversations between @entity1 and @entity30 influenced the decision not to contact outside agencies , something @entity2 was required to do under state law , is unclear			1
an internal @entity2 investigation headed by former fbi director @entity83 also has turned up billing records from @entity2 officials to the university 's outside council around the time of the 2001 incident showing @entity2 was " researching its legal obligations " for reporting the assault , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the results of @entity83 's investigation are expected before the end of the summer			0
asked whether @entity2 had any comment on the alleged e-mails , school spokesman @entity98 said the university and board of trustees are " reserving comment " until after @entity83 's report is released			1
@entity105 , a lawyer for the @entity1 family , issued a statement following @entity0 's disclosure of the purported e-mails			1
" some number of e-mail exchanges between former @entity2 officials have apparently been leaked to the media			1
since the @entity1 family is not in possession of these e-mails , it would be inappropriate to comment on their supposed content , " the statement said			1
" to be clear , the e-mails in question did not originate with @entity1 or go to him as he never personally utilized e-mail			2
" @entity105 noted that @entity1 , " from the beginning ... warned against a rush to judgment in this case			2
coach @entity1 testified truthfully , to the best of his recollection , in the one brief appearance he made before the grand jury			0
as he testified , when informed of an incident involving @entity7 in 2001 , coach @entity1 followed university procedures and promptly and fully informed his superiors			1
he believed the matter would be thoroughly and professionally investigated and he did not interfere with or attempt to compromise any investigation			0
" monday , @entity105 released another statement , calling on @entity83 and the @entity137 attorney general to release all e-mails and records they have related to the case			0
the " selective " leaking of e-mails " is not intended to inform the discussion but to smear former @entity2 officials , including @entity1 , " said @entity105			1
" the public should not have to try and piece together a story from a few records that have been selected in a calculated way to manipulate public opinion			0
@entity1 did n't fear the truth , he sought the truth			0
his guidance to his family and his advisors was to pursue the full truth			0
this is the course we have followed for 9 months			0
it is the course we will follow to the end , " he said			0
painful chapter closes with @entity7 's conviction @entity1 testified to the grand jury that @entity20 was " very upset " when relating the incident and told him that he saw @entity7 " doing something with a youngster			1
it was a sexual nature , " according to a transcript			0
@entity1 said he told @entity30			0
attorneys for @entity170 and @entity30 issued a statement on their behalf			0
" for @entity30 , @entity170 , @entity175 and @entity1 , the responsible and ' humane ' thing to do was , like @entity176 ( @entity178 ) @entity177 , to carefully and responsibly assess the best way to handle vague , but troubling allegations , " the attorneys said in a statement to @entity0 on friday			0
" faced with tough situations , good people try to do their best to make the right decisions			0
" @entity1 and @entity175 were ousted from their jobs after the @entity7 scandal broke in november			2
when @entity1 was fired , the university 's board of trustees questioned his leadership for not doing more			0
@entity170 had retired in 2009			0
@entity1 family spokesman @entity190 told @entity0 the coach 's final guidance to him before @entity1 died was " to seek the truth " and due process for everyone involved			1
calls to @entity175 's lawyer have not been returned			0
@entity30 and @entity170 have pleaded not guilty to charges of perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse			0
it 's not known when the @entity137 attorney general 's office will complete its ongoing investigation of what @entity2 knew about the 2001 incident and how it was handled			1
mourning @entity1 , a flawed hero @entity0 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			2
