-- his appointment at @entity3 was regarded as a something of coup , but less than a year after his arrival in @entity8 the first cracks have appeared in the relationship between @entity10 and the @entity12 club			1
widely regarded as the best coach in the world , @entity10 joined @entity3 last year armed with a footballing philosophy that had brought him world domination during his time at @entity18			1
the @entity19 quickly guided @entity3 to victories in the club @entity21 and the @entity22 , before securing the @entity12 @entity24 title in record - breaking speed			1
but after crashing out of the @entity28 at the semifinal stage to @entity30 this week in humiliating fashion , the @entity19 's possession - based style of football has come under criticism			1
" if we do n't win , it does not help me when @entity3 's chief executive @entity36 and sporting director @entity37 , are backing me , " @entity10 told reporters friday			1
" if we lose i 'm a risk for the club			0
it 's a big club and you always have to win			0
if this does n't happen , the club may decide something else			2
" perhaps more worryingly for @entity10 , honorary president @entity45 openly expressed his exasperation after @entity3 's @entity28 exit			1
" @entity3 are not right , " @entity45 , who both played for and managed @entity3 , told @entity49 newspaper @entity48			2
" this is something that we have known for weeks			0
" but @entity10 is adamant he will not alter his approach , insisting it is down to @entity3 to decide if they want him to continue as manager			1
" the club must decide whether the coach is the right man for this team , " said the 43 - year - old @entity19			1
@entity3 's 4 - 0 home defeat by @entity30 raised questions that @entity10 's team is too tactically predictable			1
" i 'm a strong person			0
there was lot of criticism but that 's the nature of the beast			0
criticism is normal , " @entity10 said			1
" i ca n't train the players with other coaches ' ideas			0
even after the defeat [ against @entity30 ] i 'm confident in my own ideas			0
" next season , we will play 100 % with my ideas			0
i ca n't coach this club or its players without believing in my ideas			0
" @entity10 says he is already planning for life in @entity80 next season , when he will be hoping to repeat his success on the domestic front , while going those extra steps further in @entity84			2
despite the setback in @entity84 , @entity10 could yet win a fourth trophy this season with @entity3 playing @entity88 in the @entity90 final on may 17			1
later friday , @entity91 was elected as the new president of the @entity8 giants , succeeding @entity94 , who will serve a three and a half year jail term for tax fraud			2
@entity94 , who was at the meeting ahead starting his sentence , received a standing ovation from the club members and hinted he would return once he is a free man			0
" i made a huge mistake and i will accept that			0
when i return , i am not going to retire , " said the 62 - year - old @entity94 , who was found guilty of evading $ 39.5 million of taxes at a trial earlier this year			0
@entity105 , who is 61 , has spent over 30 years in a series of senior positions at @entity3 .			2

@entity10 says @entity3 must decide if he is right coach for *job*
@entity10 has faced criticism recently for his tactics
