-- he returned to a hero 's welcome but this was a night to forget for @entity4			2
feted by all those inside @entity5 , @entity4 stood and took in the applause from those in @entity8			2
one of the greatest player 's in the club 's history , @entity4 's spot kick in @entity10 , which secured the 2011 @entity12 title , will never be forgotten			1
but once the presentations were over and the mutual love was placed to one side , @entity4 's former teammates moved onto a different stratosphere			0
from the moment @entity23 gave @entity25 a fourth minute leader , there was only one side which appeared likely to win this contest -- and unfortunately for @entity4 , it was not @entity28			1
@entity29 smashed home a second just before halftime following some dreadful defending from the visiting side to end any thoughts @entity4 may have had of a happy homecoming			0
before the game , all the talk had been about the returning @entity4 -- a man loved by all at @entity25 , especially by manager , @entity41			1
the @entity42 netted 157 goals in 342 appearances during an eight - year spell at @entity25 where he won three @entity47 titles and four @entity48			1
@entity41 believes @entity4 will one day return to west @entity50 either in a playing , coaching or ambassadorial position			0
but any sign of sentimentality was swept away as soon as the first ball was kicked			0
following the 1 - 1 draw in @entity57 , @entity25 wasted little time in asserting its superiority			1
a weekend defeat in the @entity47 by @entity60 in which @entity61 and @entity62 were both sent off , was shunted aside as @entity25 began at rapid pace			1
@entity64 and @entity65 combined to release @entity23 and the forward fired past @entity67 to claim the 30th @entity12 goal of his career			1
@entity25 , which faces @entity70 in the @entity47 on saturday , continued to dominate and @entity71 volleyed inches over after meeting @entity73 's cross			1
@entity28 's vulnerability at set - pieces was to prove its undoing just before the interval when @entity73 's corner picked out @entity71 and when the defender 's powerful header was saved , @entity29 was quickest to react and slam home the rebound			2
the @entity84 side , which showed such defiance in the first leg , failed to threaten any sort of fightback after the break with @entity25 goalkeeper @entity90 a mere spectator			1
substitute @entity92 should have added a third after being played through by @entity65 by @entity67 pulled off the save			0
" it was everything we wanted it to be , " midfielder @entity73 told @entity94			0
" it was a tough game , we got a decent result out there and they hardly threatened			0
" the midfielder is now hoping his side receives a favorable draw in the next round with the likes of @entity108 and @entity109 lurking			0
" i wo n't make any predictions yet , " he added			0
" there are number of great teams left in it and we 'll wait and see who we get drawn against			0
" we 're confident at the minute but it 's very tough and gets tougher every year			0
but we 're still in it			0
" rampant ronaldo in the night 's other game , @entity117 scored twice to give @entity119 a 3 - 1 home win over @entity121			1
leading 6 - 1 from the first leg , @entity117 took his tally to 13 goals in seven @entity12 appearances with a classy double			1
@entity127 had dragged @entity121 level in between @entity117 's strikes before @entity130 added a third			1
the only sour note on the night was an injury to @entity133 , who was taken off on a stretcher after two minutes following a challenge from @entity136			2
" i think it is confirmed he has ruptured cruciate ligament , " @entity119 manager @entity137 told reporters " he has had bad luck and it is bad luck for @entity119 because we are going to lose a very important , young player who has done very well this season and surprised everyone			2
" next up for @entity119 is " @entity151 " with @entity109 the visitor to @entity150 on sunday .			2

@entity25 cruises into last eight of @entity12
@entity25 won 2 - 0 on the night , 3 - 1 on aggregate
@entity119 eases into *quarterfinals*
@entity117 on target for @entity119 once again
