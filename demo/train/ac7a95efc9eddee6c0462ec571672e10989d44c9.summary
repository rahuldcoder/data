-- many were surprised that he was even on the field at the @entity3 on saturday , but when @entity4 left it he did so with the adoring chants of @entity8 's fans ringing in his ears			1
@entity10 had been expected to rest the @entity12 star ahead of wednesday 's @entity13 last - 16 clash against his former club @entity15 due to fitness worries , but the 28 - year - old shrugged off any concerns with a virtuoso display			2
he fired a hat - trick in the 4 - 1 win over @entity22 , and had a hand in the other goal , before being taken off with almost half an hour to play as the sounds of " @entity4 , @entity4 " resounded around the ground			1
it was a touching moment for the player , who has not always had the closest relationship with the @entity31 despite his phenomenal scoring record			0
he took his tally to 24 in @entity34 this season -- behind only @entity36 's 34 -- and 36 in all competitions as he fired his 20th treble since joining @entity8 from @entity15 for a world - record $ 130 million fee in 2009			1
have your say on the @entity13 with the @entity0 @entity43 @entity4 's low cross gave @entity45 the easiest of his 50 @entity34 goals as the ball ricocheted kindly off @entity22 's @entity49 , then he fired in a superb left - foot effort from outside the box in the 26th minute to make it 2 - 0			1
just 36 seconds after the halftime break , @entity4 was at it again as he pounced on a error to score his 11th goal in nine games against @entity22 in all competitions			1
the 12th was worth the price of admission as he led a counter attack from his own penalty area , and slotted home a return pass from @entity65			0
the @entity66 forward departed soon after @entity4 did -- but it left @entity8 a player short after he received a second yellow card			1
@entity22 also dropped to 10 men in the 80th minute as @entity71 defender @entity70 also picked up a second booking , but @entity73 still managed a late consolation goal			0
the result left real four points behind second - placed city rivals @entity78 and 13 adrift of @entity80 , who both play on sunday			2
meanwhile , @entity83 stayed fourth with a 2 - 1 win at @entity85 thanks to two goals from 20 - year - old midfield star @entity87 , while @entity88 moved up to fifth with a 1 - 0 win at @entity90 as @entity92 striker @entity91 netted three minutes into time added on			1
@entity94 @entity97 's @entity96 title defense is in tatters after saturday 's shock 3 - 1 defeat by promoted team @entity101			1
leaders @entity15 can move 12 points clear of second - placed @entity97 with victory in sunday 's home match against @entity106			1
city boss @entity107 had been defiant after last weekend 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity109 , but the @entity110 was more downbeat about his team 's chances after dropping more points			2
" i used to be always optimistic and want to be in this moment , but it 's difficult			0
i think we now have 10 % chance			0
i do n't think @entity15 will drop 12 points , " he told reporters " it was a really poor performance			0
@entity101 were better than us			0
we conceded two goals which i did n't think a team like us could concede			0
we played this game with only two or three players			0
three versus 11 was really difficult			0
" @entity124 gave away possession for @entity101 's first goal by @entity127 and also conceded an embarrassing own - goal soon after halftime to make it 3 - 1			1
goalkeeper @entity131 was at fault for @entity134 ' goal for 2 - 0 , and @entity136 's 12th in the league this season for @entity97 in the 39th minute did not signal the fightback it promised			2
it was @entity101 's first win in four games since @entity143 took over as manager , and lifted the team six points clear of the relegation zone			2
@entity148 won for the first time in five matches to retain third place , thrashing third - bottom @entity152 4 - 1 to ease the pressure on manager @entity154			1
veteran midfielder @entity155 scored his 12th goal this season , moving closer to @entity160 's club record total of 202 , as the 34 - year - old raised speculation that he will earn a new contract			0
" it is not my decision			0
i am trying to improve him , if that is possible , because he is a great influence , " @entity154 said			0
@entity148 stayed a point ahead of fourth - placed @entity169 , whose winger @entity170 scored both goals in a 2 - 1 win at home to @entity175 to take his tally to 13 in the league			1
@entity178 moved above @entity106 into fifth with a 1 - 0 win at @entity180 as @entity181 scored the only goal , while @entity183 went above @entity109 in seventh after beating bottom team @entity185 4 - 1 thanks to two goals from @entity187 , who now has 15 in the @entity96 this season			1
@entity189 @entity191 ' hopes of a second successive @entity193 title were boosted after second - placed @entity194 dropped points against fellow @entity197 hopefuls @entity196			1
@entity191 won 2 - 0 at home to @entity199 as strikers @entity200 and @entity202 scored in the first half -- the latter despite losing a boot and playing on in his sock			2
that put the pressure on @entity194 to reduce a six - point deficit , but @entity211 's team needed an 87th - minute equalizer from defender @entity213 to come away with any reward			1
striker @entity215 volleyed an 11th - minute opener , but @entity217 international replied in kind at the end to keep his side six points clear of the third - placed @entity224 team			0
@entity225 @entity226 marched towards a 23rd @entity228 title on saturday , moving 15 points clear in the title race after a 4 - 0 victory at home to @entity233			1
with two - time defending champions @entity237 and third - placed @entity236 dropping points earlier in the day , @entity235 ' team romped to victory against a @entity233 side which had won just one out of nine games			2
young @entity244 star @entity243 scored twice , the opener from the penalty spot after @entity247 was fouled			0
@entity248 made it 2 - 0 with a free - kick , then after the break @entity252 set up the 20 - year - old @entity243 and then wrapped up the win with his first goal of 2013 in his first start this year			0
@entity237 crashed 4 - 1 at home to @entity257 , with @entity258 forward @entity259 and @entity261 @entity260 scored twice each as both teams had a man sent off			1
@entity264 put the home side ahead in front of a crowd of more than 80,000 but @entity268 netted before the @entity270 striker was sent off			0
@entity257 lost defender @entity271 after halftime following his foul on @entity274 , but @entity260 headed home on 62 and 20 - year - old son ' netted at the end as @entity257 moved up to fifth			0
@entity236 drew 3 - 3 at seventh - placed @entity278 , for whom @entity279 scored a late equalizer .			2
