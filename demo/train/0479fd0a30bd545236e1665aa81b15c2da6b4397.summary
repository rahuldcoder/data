-- @entity1 has every reason in the world not to want to talk about it			1
but talk he does in the new documentary , " client no. 9 : the @entity7 of @entity1 " opening friday in limited release			1
the film is directed by @entity10 , whose work has included acclaimed documentaries " @entity13 : the @entity14 " and " @entity15			2
" " @entity20 " traces the prostitution scandal that ended @entity1 's term as governor of @entity19 in 2008			1
@entity10 interviews several of the people who became adversaries of @entity1 in the wake of his attempts to reform both @entity26 and @entity27 as well as one of the women @entity1 allegedly saw on multiple occasions			1
@entity1 recently spoke with @entity0 about why he participated in the film , his thoughts on the theory that there was a conspiracy to topple him from power and what he has learned in the wake of the scandal			1
@entity0 : let 's start with the obvious question of why did you agree to participate in the documentary ? @entity1 : i thought it would help with getting the facts out and i thought that [ @entity10 ] was interested in doing a straightforward recitation of facts and i thought that i could lend insight			1
@entity0 : did you have any hesitation at all about dredging the whole thing up again ? @entity1 : if you begin with the premise that he was making the movie , it just seemed to me to make more sense to participate and present the facts as i saw them			1
@entity0 : what did you think of the film ? @entity1 : i 'm neither a film critic nor in this case the best person to pass judgment , but i thought it was a fair story			1
@entity0 : i 'm sure you would rather move on in your life , but what is it like to watch this situation play out again on the big screen and know that filmgoers will do the same ? @entity1 : look , you go on with your life and you learn to do what you are interested in and focus on what you are doing			1
you realize that other things will be going on but they are not the things i am focusing on			2
@entity0 : the film , or at least the trailer , makes it appear that there was this whole conspiracy [ by @entity26 titans ] to bring you down			2
what are your thoughts about that ? @entity1 : what i 've said throughout this is that i resigned because i thought it was the appropriate step to take in the context of what i had done , whether there were other things going on or what others were focused on			1
@entity0 : how were you approached about being in the film ? @entity1 : honestly , i ca n't remember			1
i presume i got an e-mail or a phone call			0
i 'm sure @entity10 knows somebody i know and someone said , " hey they are doing a documentary on your life and is n't that a nice thing to hear ? " one way or another i ended up on the phone with @entity10 and we chatted			2
i think there were several conversations that finally resulted in agreeing to sit down with him			0
he 's someone whose resume speaks for itself			0
he 's someone who makes serious movies and does n't dabble in the world of the scurrilous and shadows			0
he makes serious movies and he 's won some serious awards			0
@entity0 : did you have any rules going in about things you would n't discuss ? @entity1 : i do n't recall that there were any ground rules			1
@entity0 : how does it feel to be " infamous " ? @entity1 : oh , i do n't know			1
i think i 'm many different things to many different people			0
@entity0 : why did you want to be a part of your @entity0 show " @entity127 ? " @entity1 : it is great fun			1
it is an effort to bring a smart debate and conversation to the air every night at 8 o'clock rather than a linear , sort of ideologically driven presentation that other networks have and i say that with a great deal of respect for what they put on the air and admiration for how they do it			0
but this is an effort to give the viewer both sides of the debate			0
@entity0 : now that the scandal is over , you 've moved on and you have a new show , what do you feel like you have learned ? @entity1 : life is peaks and valleys			2
i think we all are aware of that and it 's better to be at a peak , but often you learn more in the valley			0
you go forward trying to do what you care about and taking care of the people you care about			0
it 's not very complicated			0
@entity0 : you say it 's not very complicated , but from the outside looking in it seems a bit complicated			0
@entity1 : the principles are easily stated			2
it 's more complicated to live them in life , but to state the principles is n't that complicated			0
@entity0 : what do you hope people take away from this film ? @entity1 : certainly i hope they appreciate that when i was in government we did what mattered for the public on views that seemed important then , but i think have become even more important , and the sense that we fought awfully hard for the public both as attorney general and governor and focused on what was important			2
i saw the rough cut and what they showed at the film festivals			0
i do n't know how much it differs from the final version , but i think some of that certainly came through in the movie and i hope [ viewers ] do take that away with them .			0
