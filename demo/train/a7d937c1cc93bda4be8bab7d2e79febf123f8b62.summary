@entity0 -- it might not have had the drama of a sen. @entity5 , but some @entity6 hope their all - night effort draws similar attention to their issue that has been stalled in @entity10 : climate change			1
mirroring a tactic employed by @entity15 during his marathon effort aimed at derailing @entity17 , sen. @entity12 of @entity13 read from dr. @entity18 during his turn speaking just before midnight tuesday			2
he chose the children 's book " @entity20 , " which touches on the environment			2
" but now says the @entity20 , now that you 're here , the word of the @entity20 seems perfectly clear			2
unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot , nothing is going to get better , " @entity12 read , then added his own thoughts : " so to my colleagues here in the @entity6 and everyone watching and following tonight thank you for caring a whole awful lot			2
" twenty - eight dems participate the effort by 28 @entity37 senators was launched in part by @entity40 's @entity39 , who credits warming oceans for the state 's disappearing idyllic and populated coastline			2
@entity39 has spoken about the issue every week the @entity6 has been in session for the past two years , culminating in 60 speeches that have gone largely unnoticed by the public			1
he and fellow @entity37 members of the climate change caucus hope their all - night session propels the issue back into the spotlight since it has been on the back burner for several years			1
" there 's a group of senators who have not given up on getting something done on climate change and are n't willing to just sit quietly through the current status quo , " @entity39 told @entity1 in a phone interview on monday			1
after climate change legislation , one of president @entity65 's top three priorities entering office , failed in 2010 , the issue fell off the radar			1
the president rarely talked about it			0
@entity10 did little to address it			0
" if you were looking for reassurance that somebody took this seriously in @entity0 , you were n't finding much , " @entity39 said			0
why the renewed focus on climate change ? the third rail climate change turned into an issue that few wanted to touch , especially those facing difficult reelection campaigns			1
when @entity6 tried to pass legislation that would have capped carbon emissions , skepticism around climate change reached an all - time high			1
according to @entity87 , 48 % of respondents said the issue on its face is exaggerated			2
opponents , led by organizations and businesses involved in the fossil fuel industry , successfully turned public opinion and stopped any efforts in its tracks			2
the death of climate change opponents successfully renamed cap and trade , which referred to legislation that placed limits on carbon emissions by power plants and other major polluters , to " cap and tax			1
" amid recession , they argued the proposal would kill jobs and raise energy prices			0
key players in changing the dynamic of the debate were the @entity117 , billionaire businessmen who made their fortune in the oil and gas industry and have also spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to defeat @entity6			2
@entity121 and trade would have cut into @entity124 ' revenue , which is estimated to hover around $ 100 billion per year			0
@entity125 , the president of @entity126 , the political organization backed by the @entity127 , said that killing climate change legislation in a @entity37 - controlled @entity0 was his organization 's major accomplishment			1
" stopping cap and trade was a crucial policy victory that most folks would have thought impossible at the time , " he said during a recent interview			0
" defeating that was an enormous policy victory that has lasting policy repercussions in a good way			0
" not only did they kill the legislation , they successfully helped to elect a crop of new lawmakers who do n't believe that human activity is the cause of global warming			0
according to the @entity147 , 100 lawmakers currently fall into their ranks			0
@entity39 had this response : it 's " something that his grandchildren will be very ashamed of			0
" opinion : why are we still debating climate change ? the top @entity155 in the @entity6 , sen. @entity156 , took to the floor monday afternoon to deride the climate change talkers as " cruel			1
" " families are losing work because of government attacks on the coal industry , " @entity159 said , referring to his home state of @entity162			0
" and tonight you 're going to hear 30 hours of excuses from a group of people who think that 's ok			0
well it 's not ok			0
" a revival ? the death of cap and trade triggered new fears among environmentally friendly legislators			0
" it is unfortunate , " @entity39 said			0
" @entity181 will look back at the propaganda effort of the carbon polluters as one of the most sophisticated and complex propaganda efforts that human kind had to withstand			2
" but since then , the public has started to shift its opinion			0
according to @entity87 , 41 % now say that climate change is exaggerated -- 7 points lower than its high in 2010			1
and the number of those who say the seriousness of the issue is underestimated is on the rise			2
now @entity39 thinks it 's his side 's turn to make a move			0
he has buy in from the senate majority leader @entity200 who told reporters last week that it is " the worst problem " the world faces			0
but they have to start at @entity205 by working to convince the public that climate change is real			1
the @entity6 's all - night session is well - timed			1
wealthy former hedge fund manager @entity209 is willing to spend @entity211 - like money to push the issue of climate change and defeat skeptics in the 2014 midterms			1
@entity39 , who has known @entity209 since college , said if he can make good on his pledge to infuse the effort with $ 100 million , he would " help to neutralize an incredibly one - sided spending			1
" " we can change the conversation very quickly			2
" the absentees but not all @entity6 - and no @entity155 - are on board			1
notable senators were absent from the overnight session monday into tuesday			2
they include those who have difficult election campaigns , including sens. @entity228 of @entity229 , @entity230 of @entity231 , @entity232 of @entity233 and @entity234 of @entity235			0
@entity155 are n't letting @entity228 's absence go unnoticed			0
the @entity237 , which aims to get @entity155 elected to the @entity6 , put out a web video tuesday , criticizing @entity228 for allowing the talk - a - thon to take place			1
the video also argues she does n't stand up enough for @entity244 energy			0
@entity245 , a senior vice president of the @entity147 , said the fact that just over half of the @entity37 caucus is willing to speak in the wee hours of the night about climate change is " incredibly exciting " and " good politics			1
" in fact , @entity39 is working to ensure that climate change is a topic in the 2016 presidential race by traveling to @entity255 next week to talk to voters and activists			1
he insists he is not running for president but wants to make sure those who do talk about the impact of climate change			1
@entity65 's engagement after a hiatus post 2010 , the @entity65 administration is also back in the climate change game			1
president @entity65 proposed his @entity266 this past summer that would create carbon pollution standards for power plants and expand renewable energy production			0
and in his new budget plan , the president proposed funding to study the impacts of climate change			1
secretary of state @entity276 said last month that climate change is the " greatest challenge of our generation			1
" @entity39 is optimistic that the tide is turning			0
so much so that he traveled to @entity282 , @entity283 , this past weekend to speak at the conservative @entity285 conference			0
" i think it went pretty well , " he said			0
is it time to agree on climate change ? @entity1 's @entity289 , @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this story .			1
