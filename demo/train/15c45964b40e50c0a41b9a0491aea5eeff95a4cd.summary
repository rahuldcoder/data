the latest " @entity11 " issued by the @entity12 last week made for grim reading , telling of " an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against @entity3 , @entity4 and coalition partner interests throughout the world , especially in the @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10			2
" much of the bulletin dwelled on the threat from the @entity15 in @entity16 and @entity17			0
but among a laundry list of dangerous places was this sentence : " terrorist organizations continue to be active in @entity22 , including @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
" it was a brief , generic commentary on the group still regarded by many analysts as @entity28 's most effective affiliate , and which is now exploiting a surge in political turmoil in @entity22			1
as a reminder of how dangerous @entity23 is , the @entity12 on tuesday published an unusual " wanted " list " offering rewards totaling up to $ 45 million for information leading to the locations of eight key leaders " of the group			0
the @entity3 has invested heavily in @entity22 president @entity37 , who was elected in 2012 and pledged to reverse gains that @entity23 had made in the south and east of the country			2
@entity37 reorganized @entity22 's military , and for a while -- with considerable @entity3 assistance -- it put @entity23 on the defensive			1
but on september 21 , the country 's always combustible political landscape exploded when @entity48 rebels seized government buildings in the capital , @entity51 , and its airport			1
the @entity48 are @entity53 who make up an estimated 30 % of the population but have long felt marginalized by the @entity56 majority in @entity22			1
they are now demanding greater political influence			0
blast kills 47 at @entity48 protest in @entity22 @entity56 - @entity53 divide that is a red rag to radical @entity63 , including supporters or members of @entity23 , who regard the @entity48 as apostates to be driven from @entity68 lands or killed			1
they claim @entity70 is bankrolling the @entity48 rebellion in an effort to control @entity22 's @entity74 coast , on one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes			1
monday 's capture by @entity48 militia of much of the coastal city of @entity81 -- @entity22 's second - largest port -- will only heighten that fear			1
even @entity37 has alleged that the @entity48 are being trained and advised by @entity84 , the @entity85 @entity53 militia			2
@entity86 , which provides energy and financial support to @entity22 and shares a long border with it , is looking on with growing apprehension			0
on monday , @entity37 appointed a new prime minister , @entity92 , who is currently @entity22 's envoy at the @entity93			0
some @entity48 leaders spoke positively of @entity92 's appointment , but unless @entity48 militia are reined in , @entity22 could quickly become another theater in the @entity56 / @entity53 confrontation gripping much of the @entity7			1
exploiting the conflict @entity23 is doing as much as it can to stoke a sectarian war			0
last week , it launched a devastating suicide bombing against a @entity48 rally in @entity51 , which killed nearly 50 people			0
it also released a video showing its fighters purportedly removing 14 @entity48 men from a bus and executing them			0
at the same time , @entity23 has stepped up attacks against the army and police ; a suicide bombing at a military checkpoint in remote @entity114 province last week killed 20 soldiers			0
in recent weeks , the group has released a series of appeals to @entity63 in @entity22 to support its campaign against the @entity48 , casting itself as the only group capable of preventing what it claims is a plot by @entity70 to take over the country			1
its videos and statements refer to the " @entity22 turned @entity48 army			2
" " do not leave a checkpoint for ( the @entity48 ) that you do not strike , nor a headquarters that you do not bomb , nor a troop carrier that you do not explode , " said one of @entity23 's leaders , @entity128 , in a video released on september 30 , according to a translation by the @entity132			1
@entity63 in @entity22 have staged @entity140 demonstrations in recent weeks			2
and even some in government may now see @entity23 as a useful counterweight to the @entity48			1
the worst - case scenario : a repeat of 2011 , when roiling protests in the capital and infighting between different army units allowed @entity23 to seize control of several towns in southern @entity22 -- towns they held for months			2
now , there is the additional destabilizing factor of a growing secessionist movement in the south			0
once again , @entity22 seems close to becoming a failing state ; the sort of place where @entity28 incubates quickly			2
@entity23 defections the main threat to @entity23 may be from within , as some jihadists opt for the even more radical option of @entity165			0
there is now a group called @entity168 in the @entity169 , which has promised attacks against @entity48			0
according to @entity171 , which monitors jihadist communications , one former @entity23 commander , @entity173 , has already pledged allegiance to @entity165 leader @entity175			0
assuming @entity23 can avoid defections , its ability to plan terror attacks beyond the @entity7 remains far greater than that of @entity165			2
@entity3 officials say @entity23 still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb - making know - how with jihadists in @entity17 , specifically within an @entity28 affiliate , @entity186			1
@entity23 chief bomb - maker @entity187 has three times plotted to bring down @entity3 - bound aircraft , coming closest to success on christmas day in 2009 when a @entity193 recruit attempted to blow up a bomb in his underwear in the skies above @entity197			0
earlier this year , @entity23 leader @entity198 , who is also @entity28 leader @entity199 's deputy , told a large gathering of fighters that attacking the @entity3 was a central priority , a message repeated by @entity128 last month			1
" each front must strike @entity3 and its interests everywhere			0
we have recognized the main enemy , @entity3 , for decades , " @entity128 said			0
while debate rages in @entity209 and @entity9 about the intentions of @entity165 and @entity186 in exporting terror to the @entity212 , the most lethal of @entity28 's affiliates is exploiting and stoking @entity22 's latest crisis .			1

many analysts say @entity23 is @entity28 's most effective affiliate
the group is exploiting political turmoil in @entity22 , where @entity48 rebels are fighting government
radical @entity63 say @entity48 are apostates and should be driven from @entity68 lands or killed
@entity22 could become a theater in the @entity56 / @entity53 confrontation gripping much of the @entity7
