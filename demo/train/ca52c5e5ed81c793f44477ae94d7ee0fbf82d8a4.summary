@entity0 , @entity1 -- it used to be an old factory churning out parts for the mining industry before slowly falling into neglect and turned into a garage for vehicle repairs			1
but now , after a renovation process , the high - ceilinged warehouse has been reinvented as a modern art deco space intended to house @entity1 's most cutting - edge design ideas and exhibit them to the world			1
welcome to the @entity15 , or @entity16 , a 2,500 square meter space which claims to be the first of its kind on the continent			2
situated inside @entity0 's vibrant @entity23 precinct , a former crime hotspot that 's undergoing an urban rejuvenation , @entity16 opened its doors late last month with the vision to become a pan-african platform for contemporary creativity and innovation			1

" a place to showcase what 's going on the continent that 's innovative but also to encourage that kind of thinking , design and creativity to young @entity1 and to people visiting @entity0 at the same time			1
" true to its character the spacious downtown building , which dates back to the 1920s , had been earmarked as a museum since its acquisition by the @entity23 developers in 2011			0
but it only hosted a number of temporary exhibitions and events during the past year before work started in july to transform it into a permanent home for @entity1 design			2

" we will continue ' refining ' the space , but the goal is to leave it as original and industrial as possible , " explains @entity33			0
' new ways to see the world ' the museum 's launch event took place on october 24 with the annual showcase of the @entity86 collection , a 10 - day exhibition presenting the creations of some of @entity1 's top designers and artists			1
renowned architect @entity92 , who was born in @entity93 to @entity95 parents , was the guest of honor at the event			0
" i believe in design as a very important edifying element for community , for culture , for civilization , " he told @entity2 hours before the official opening			0
" i think it 's one of the hallmarks of how we talk about creating awareness about who we are and what values we have in the world , " added @entity92			0
read this : @entity92 's favorite buildings " design is very good , it 's almost like a diver ; it seeks out new ways which you can see the world ; it goes down and discovers new things that bring it back up and it shows it to us			2
i think that 's really important			0
" ' native nostalgia ' after the launch event , which had a @entity1 focus , @entity16 is now making its first foray into the continent 's creativity with " @entity130 , " the museum 's inaugural full - length exhibition			1
starting today , the group show explores the idea of nostalgia and what it means for @entity1 artists to look at dark chapters in history , including apartheid and colonialism , in a fond manner			2
it features a series of mixed media creations from a number of @entity1 artists , including @entity148 from @entity149 , @entity150 from @entity151 , the @entity152 and @entity1 collective i see a different you			1
read this : tribal beauty of vanishing life " @entity124 " is curated by @entity33 , but the @entity16 director says that in the future the museum will be working with different people for every exhibition			2
he also outlines that @entity16 is not interested in becoming a collective institution that stores art or wastes any budget on insurance and acquiring fees			0
" we want to focus on the most exciting and relevant exhibitions that we can put on with works from across the continent , " says @entity33			0
" i think that 's a new model that a lot more institutions around the world are looking at in terms of not having necessarily conventional museum staff , not having a permanent collection -- it allows an institution that 's interested in the contemporary to stay contemporary , " adds @entity33			0
" @entity124 " runs until february 9			1
upcoming exhibitions at @entity16 include " @entity183 , " running from march to may , and " @entity184 , " from june to august .			0
