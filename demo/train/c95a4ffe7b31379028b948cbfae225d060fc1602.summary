-- hey girl , you " do n't need makeup , " but a little lip gloss would n't hurt			1
they may sing about natural beauty in the song " @entity8 , " but that 's not stopping @entity11 's @entity10 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 from releasing a line of beauty products targeted at their female fan base			1
the @entity20 pop group has teamed up with @entity22 - based makeup brand @entity21 to create " @entity23 , " a collection of lipstick , lip gloss , blush , and nail polish inspired by the guys ' favorite colors and flavors			1
@entity0 : making dollars on scents : @entity11 , @entity34 , more stars strike perfume deals among the sure - to - be must - have products is a scented lip polish that comes with the promise of " super soft lips that smell good enough to eat			1
" the balms come in five shades , which are named after each guy 's favorite flavor — " @entity14 loves @entity47 , " " @entity12 loves @entity48 , " " louis loves vanilla , " " @entity10 loves @entity51 , " " @entity13 loves blueberry " — so choose according to your particular @entity11 crush and pretend to pucker up			0
if you 're not that innocent , the more mature " @entity53 " lipstick colors range from soft pink ( " moments " ) to siren red ( " @entity56 " )			0
@entity0 : full coverage of style and design @entity62 tints come in " @entity63 , " " @entity64 , " and " @entity65 , " but despite the , uh , cheeky names , each of the three shades is actually quite age - appropriate considering the band 's young audience			0
rounding out the collection is a line of five nail polish colors , each bottle bearing the countenance of a @entity11 cutie			2
according to the @entity21 website , each of the products in the line is priced under £ 3 ( around $ 4.60 usd ) and will be available " very soon ! ! " at @entity81			2
one direction have already released a line of school supplies with @entity85 and a signature 1d fragrance is in the works			1
