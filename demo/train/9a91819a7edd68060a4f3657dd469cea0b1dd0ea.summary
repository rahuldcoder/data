@entity0 -- the @entity3 - controlled @entity2 passed legislation on thursday extending the federal government 's ability to borrow new money through mid-may , delaying a partisan standoff that some analysts warn could derail a fragile economic recovery			1
the bill , which passed in a 64 - 34 vote , cleared the @entity14 - run @entity13 last week			2
it now advances to president @entity17 's desk to be signed into law			0
while the measure suspends @entity0 's $ 16.4 trillion debt ceiling through may 19 , some budget analysts estimate it will give the @entity22 the ability to meet all federal spending obligations through at least the end of july			1
in exchange for temporarily suspending the debt ceiling , the bill requires lawmakers in both chambers of @entity31 to pass a budget by mid-april or have their pay withheld			1
the requirement was added at the insistence of congressional @entity14 , who wanted to highlight the failure of @entity37 to pass a budget resolution since 2009			0
@entity37 note that such resolutions are not binding , and insist they would have been superseded by the @entity40 , which established budgetary restrictions for the last two fiscal years			0
top @entity42 @entity37 have been divided over the bill			0
some railed against the pay withholding provision -- calling it a political gimmick -- while others supported the measure as a whole because it removes an immediate threat of default and at least temporarily divorces the debt ceiling from @entity14 spending cut demands			1
for their part , top @entity14 have essentially conceded that a fight over raising the debt ceiling is not the best political avenue for achieving their twin deficit and spending reduction goals			2
most political analysts believe that a 2011 debt ceiling fight , which led to the passage of the @entity40 , did not play to the @entity14 's political advantage			2
that partisan fight led to a downgrade in the gold - plated @entity67 credit rating and was thought to have slowed the fragile economic recovery			0
beyond the debt ceiling , the @entity13 and @entity2 will be forced to grapple shortly with two other polarizing budget - related deadlines			1
if @entity31 fails to act by march 1 , a pending sequester will trigger roughly $ 1 trillion in new defense and non-defense cuts over the next decade -- cuts generally disliked on both sides of the aisle			0
in addition , federal funding for the current fiscal year is currently set to expire on march 27 , forcing a government shutdown unless @entity31 can agree on at least a new temporary spending package			1
@entity83 and @entity84 contributed to this report			0
