-- for the second time in just over a week , @entity1 has done an about - face on a feature that has bothered some users for a while			1
fewer automatic posts will be showing up in your @entity7 telling you what a friend is listening to on @entity12 , which level they just defeated on " @entity15 " or when they 've posted a filtered selfie on @entity18			1
the social - media giant has announced it will be giving those posts less clout in its news feed algorithm -- the tool that decides which posts you 're mostly likely to want to see -- while giving extra emphasis to actions your friends choose to share			1
so , to use the @entity12 example , you 'll be less likely to see an automatic post when a friend listens to a song but more likely to notice when they share a playlist they just created			2
" we 've found that stories people choose to explicitly share from third party apps are typically more interesting and get more engagement in @entity7 than stories shared from third party apps without explicit action , " @entity1 's @entity36 wrote in a post on the company 's blog for developers			1
" we 've also heard that people often feel surprised or confused by stories that are shared without taking an explicit action			0
in the coming months , we will continue to prioritize explicitly shared stories from apps in @entity7 over implicitly shared stories			0
" @entity36 said that app creators will have to start specifically request that actions from their app be automatically shared			0
" if your app is currently publishing stories implicitly , we encourage you to consider these options instead , " @entity36 wrote , listing tools that let users tell their friends what they 're up to			2
they include a new tool that lets app users share their activity directly in @entity69 chats ( say , with all your friends who still play " @entity72 ? " ) and the ability to add the " like " button , already appearing on more than 10 million web pages , to mobile apps			1
and @entity1 is walking the walk , too			2
@entity18 , which @entity1 purchased in 2012 , was among the first third - party apps to get rid of automatic posts			1
reactions on social media have been largely positive , even if many posts have a " what took you so long ? " feel about them			0
" great news to start my day			0
i am truly happy , " wrote @entity88 , a @entity89 user from @entity90			0
" @entity94 's in there , " @entity91 , founder of marketing group @entity92 , added on the networking site			0
the change came less than a week after @entity1 announced that all new users will have their privacy settings default to " friends only " and that existing users will get messages urging them to make sure their settings are where they want them			1
critics have questioned @entity1 's commitment to privacy over the course of its 10 - year history , claiming the company would prefer users share as openly as possible -- which advertisers like -- than adjust their settings to be more private			1
but changes in recent months suggest the social platform has decided on a different tack			0
last month , @entity1 rolled out the ability to log in " anonymously , " preventing other websites and third - party apps from collecting data about you .			2

@entity1 says automatic posts from apps are being *de-emphasized*
users will be more likely to see what their friends share intentionally
@entity18 is among the first to quit automatically posting activity
many users find auto - posts from apps annoying
