-- everyone loves a sporting feud			2
some of the most enduring rivalries in sport have been born through individuals , or entire teams , that were n't particularly fond of the other			2
who does n't enjoy the sight of two men who should know better -- @entity13 manager @entity12 and @entity15 counterpart @entity14 -- shoving each other on the sidelines during an @entity19 match ? just look at the ill - tempered clash between @entity22 champions @entity21 and rivals @entity23 on sunday night that spawned three controversial penalties and two red cards after a late melee			1
even cricket -- that most genteel of sports -- is at it , @entity29 cricketer @entity28 releasing an autobiography in which he takes a swipe at former teammates and coaches			1
here , @entity0 takes a look at five sporting feuds that are en vogue at present			1
@entity12 vs. @entity14 these two great rivals have n't seen eye to eye almost from the day @entity12 pitched up at @entity13 from @entity44 football in 2004			1
their first spat centered on @entity14 's criticism of @entity13 's lavish spending under billionaire @entity49 owner @entity48 , @entity12 hitting back by calling his opposite number a " voyeur			1
" @entity13 's boss later claimed he had a dossier on things @entity14 had said about his club , hinting at legal action			1
it did n't take long for @entity12 to revive the rivalry upon his return to @entity13 in 2013 , calling @entity14 a " specialist in failure			1
" on sunday , @entity14 shoved @entity12 on the touchline after reacting angrily to a strong tackle on his player @entity64			1
the fourth official intervened , separating the two , as @entity13 went on to win 2 - 0 and make it 12 matches without defeat for @entity12 against @entity14			1
afterwards @entity13 's coach said there was " no problem " between the two , while @entity14 said " what is there to regret ? " @entity28 vs @entity75 the man referred to by fans as " @entity28 " has waited a long time to have his say on his sacking from the @entity82 cricket team after a disastrous tour to @entity84			1
@entity82 were thumped 5 - 0 in the ashes by its most fierce rival at the turn of the year and when @entity28 had his contract canceled in february , he had to wait until october until a confidentiality clause expired to have his say			2
he was accused of being " disengaged " by the @entity90 but has hit back , claiming they told him he was being dismissed for " cricketing reasons " and would n't elaborate			2
@entity28 reserves particular ire for @entity75 , @entity82 's former vice captain , who he accuses of fostering a bullying culture within the dressing room			1
the wicketkeeper is also labeled as a " back - stabber " by @entity28 , for revealing details of a supposedly confidential team meeting during the @entity84 tour			2
prior took to @entity103 to say that he would respond , but at a later date and not on the social media site			0
he said he was looking forward to reading the book and joked : " might bully my kids into getting it for me for @entity111 ! ! " @entity112 vs. @entity113 eight - time major winner @entity112 was supposed to be the man to finally secure a @entity116 victory in golf 's premier team competition , the @entity119 , at the 2014 tournament in @entity121 last month but just like seven of the last eight captains , he tasted defeat , as @entity124 made it three on the bounce courtesy of a 16½ - 11½ victory at @entity127			1
the inquest began within hours of the final shot , and it emerged from a surprising source within the team -- @entity113 , a man with five majors of his own			2
his eulogy about 2008 skipper @entity135 -- the only man to the lead the @entity116 to victory this century -- was seen as thinly veiled criticism of @entity112 , and turned the team 's press conference into a tension - filled affair			1
@entity113 said @entity135 had involved the players in his decision making process and formulated a " real game plan , " the implication being that @entity112 had done neither during his tenure			1
the captain , sitting a few seats down from his player , replied : " ( @entity113 ) has a difference of opinion			1
my management philosophy is different than his			0
i had a different philosophy than @entity135			0
i decided not to go that way			0
" as details began to leak out about @entity112 's reign , he released an open letter saying he understood @entity113 's reaction and that the pair had spoken since to try and clear the air			1
@entity112 added : " the bottom line is this			2
in hindsight whatever mistakes that were made were mine			0
and i take complete and full responsibility for them			0
" @entity21 vs. @entity23 it was the most eagerly anticipated clash of the season so far in @entity22 , as first took on second			0
both @entity177 champions @entity21 and @entity23 , who finished as runners up in 2013/14 came into their clash on saturday with 100 % records , winning five games out of five			0
it was a match that most certainly lived up to the hype and included five goals , three controversial penalty decisions and two red cards as @entity21 came out on top			0
an ill - tempered clash saw referee @entity190 under almost constant fire from the players , each of his penalty decisions provoking controversy			0
@entity21 profited from two of those , @entity23 captain @entity198 lamenting his performance after the match , saying the official favored @entity21			2
the winning goal was scored by @entity21 defender @entity206 , moments before a melee involving players from both sides saw @entity207 and @entity208 sent off			0
@entity209 vs. @entity210 @entity211 cornerman @entity209 relishes his role as one of the most outspoken players in the @entity215 , but he does have a @entity217 ring to back it up			0
recently , it 's a rival from @entity219 that has been taking up a large chunk of his time -- @entity210 , who recently signed a new contract with the @entity219 that made him the highest paid cornerback ever to have played in the @entity215			0
this not long after @entity209 had signed his own extension , but for a lesser sum			0
news of @entity210 's deal prompted @entity209 to reassert his authority by retweeting a stat that said his rival had given up seven touchdowns in 2013 compared to his one			0
after a series of replies , @entity209 tweeted a picture of his @entity217 ring			0
we await the next round with interest .			0
