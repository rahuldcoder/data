-- " why did you turn off the rv ? " @entity3 recalls asking her husband , @entity4 , as their 29 - foot rv careened off an exit toward the small town of @entity8 , @entity9			1
" i did n't , " he replied			0
just 10 days into their cross-country honeymoon , the fuel pump in their camper , lovingly known as " @entity13 , " malfunctioned			2
then came the propane leak , the broken refrigerator , the leaking roof and the fender bender in an @entity21 parking lot , to name just a few of the couple 's bumps in the road			0
it 's all part of the " grand adventure " the 23 - year - old newlyweds from @entity29 were looking for when they set out on june 1 for a seven - month , 50 - state road trip -- and an extended honeymoon			1
as their may 24 wedding date approached earlier this year , the pair decided it was an opportune time to do a little soul - searching together			0
" we 've lived in @entity29 our whole lives , 22 summers , " @entity3 says			1
" we wanted to go on this grand adventure and figure out where we wanted to live			0
we figured why do n't we just do all of it at once ? " the couple says the plan quickly escalated from " let 's just move to @entity46 " to " let 's make a documentary about finding meaning in your work , " an issue with which they both were struggling			2
both of them had always wanted to pursue a career in writing outside the day jobs they had settled into , but had never quite figured out how to translate their hobby into a dream career			0
so the couple quit their jobs -- @entity3 at a nonprofit and @entity4 in software sales -- and came up with the @entity65 - inspired scheme			1
" when i told my parents , @entity4 was n't there ... for his safety , " @entity3 jokes			1
as a young couple just getting on their feet , the next hardest part was figuring out how to make ends meet on the road			2
@entity4 , with a little entrepreneurial know - how , contacted @entity76 , an hourly employment marketplace , to help find hourly workers ( which made up 58.8 % of the @entity81 workforce in 2013 , according to the @entity81 @entity82 ) to spotlight during their travels			1
with a @entity96 router and a new video camera in tow , " @entity94 , " was born , where he spends one day shadowing an hourly worker in each state , whether working at a yoga studio in @entity89 , a farm in @entity91 or a bakery in @entity93			1
before they left , the @entity99 mapped out their route meticulously , and it now hangs above their bed so they can track their progress			0
they are saving @entity103 and @entity104 for last and will visit them by plane ( driving a rickety rv to @entity103 in wintertime is not recommended , apparently )			1
in lieu of wedding gifts , the couple asked family and friends to donate to their @entity115 crowdfunding site			0
but because of a slew of mechanical problems with the rv , the money was gone within the first month			0
" we knew we 've got to get smart really fast , " @entity3 says			1
the couple does n't get paid for their hourly jobs that are part of the documentary			2
instead , they supplement their income with freelance writing on various rv renovation and life - on - the - road websites			0
" the rv industry is kind of fascinated by us , " @entity3 says , as millennials are an unconventional demographic for the @entity107 crowd			1
speaking of unconventional , so was choosing to spend their honeymoon in an rv instead of an exotic beach somewhere			2
" it 's sometimes difficult to balance the chaos of life on the road with spending quality time together , but we chose this honeymoon knowing it was n't going to be traditional , " @entity4 says			1
" we work a lot , but we work side by side			0
it 's not exactly sipping mimosas on the beach , but we love every minute			0
" the couple planned a " honeymoon within the honeymoon " -- a weeklong drive along the @entity155 -- to share a little of that newlywed bliss			2
they 'll roll back into @entity29 on @entity158 , as their families requested , with a video and web journal of their journey plus a full " blessings book , " as they call it			1
" we started it as a way to keep optimistic , " @entity4 says			2
like that night in @entity9 when they broke down			0
they went into a nearby restaurant for a drink and a bowl of queso -- as one needs in those desperate times -- and met a couple , @entity175 and @entity176 , who teach martial arts in the small town			0
their new friends bought them a beer and let them take a free class to work out some of that road stress			0
@entity3 and @entity4 say it 's little things like that -- and parking in someone 's driveway for free or watching a @entity192 game with new pals in a neighboring rv -- that keeps them going .			1

@entity4 and @entity3 are traveling to all 50 states in an @entity107 for their honeymoon
they are working an hourly job in each stop and documenting their experiences
the trip will take seven months and end on @entity158
to make the full 50 , they 'll fly to @entity103 and @entity104
