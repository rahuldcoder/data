@entity0 -- a federal safety board called tuesday for a nationwide ban on the use of cell phones and text messaging devices while driving			1
the recommendation is the most far - reaching yet by the @entity8 , which in the past 10 years has increasingly sought to limit the use of portable electronic devices -- recommending bans for novice drivers , school bus drivers and commercial truckers			1
tuesday 's recommendation , if adopted by states , would outlaw non-emergency phone calls and texting by operators of every vehicle on the road			0
it would apply to hands - free as well as hand - held devices , but devices installed in the vehicle by the manufacturer would be allowed , the @entity8 said			1
the recommendation would not affect passengers ' rights to use such devices			2
study : distracted drivers in denial @entity8 members say the action is necessary to combat a growing threat posed by distracted drivers			1
while distracted driving has been a problem " since the @entity43 , " in the words of @entity8 chairwoman @entity42 , authorities say it has become ubiquitous with the explosion in the number of portable smart phones			1
at any given daylight moment , some 13.5 million drivers are on hand - held phones , according to a study released last week by the @entity51			1
some 3,092 roadway fatalities last year involved distracted drivers , although the actual number may be far higher , @entity51 said			1
" this ( distracted driving ) is becoming the new dui			0
it 's becoming epidemic , " said @entity8 member @entity55			2
accident investigators routinely seek protective orders to preserve smart phones for use as evidence in accident investigations , @entity42 said			0
but because distracted drivers sometimes do not own up to their actions , or because they die during the crash , determining whether distraction was a factor in an accident can be difficult			1
that was the case in a 2010 chain - reaction accident near @entity71 , @entity72			0
during the 11 minutes prior to that incident , the driver of a pickup truck received five text messages , and sent six , and he was seen leaning over just before the accident , leading investigators to believe the driver was likely distracted when his truck plowed at 55 mph into the rear of a tractor trailer , which had slowed or stopped because of a highway work zone			0
two school buses then plowed into the wreckage			0
two people -- including the pickup truck driver and a bus occupant -- were killed ; 38 other people were injured			0
the driver of the pickup truck was 19 years old , and was in violation of a @entity72 law prohibiting drivers under the age of 21 from texting while driving			0
but the safety board focused little on the age of the driver , casting " distracted driving " as epidemic among people of all ages			0
time : how dangerous is it , really ? the @entity8 said cell phone laws alone would not solve the problem , but must be accompanied by aggressive educational campaigns and strict enforcement			2
the @entity106 had issued only 120 citations for texting in a two - year - period , the @entity8 said			1
currently , a patchwork of laws governs cell - phone usage by drivers			2
some 35 states ban text messaging while driving , 30 states ban cell - phone use by novice drivers , and 10 ban all use of hand - held cell phones , according to the @entity8			1
the safety board also recommended the electronics industry develop phones that would discourage their use by drivers , but could identify a car occupant 's location so that passengers could use the devices			1
a @entity130 study of commercial drivers found that a safety - critical event is 163 times more likely if a driver is texting , e-mailing or accessing the @entity135			1
the @entity8 's action is a recommendation only , but the board has been instrumental in leading for changes in other areas of transportation safety			1
chairwoman @entity42 said the ban may inconvenience motorists , but would save lives			0
" needless lives are lost on our highways , and for what ? convenience ? death is n't convenient , " @entity42 said			0
" so we can stay more connected ? a fatal accident severs that connection			0
" the @entity8 's investigation of the august 5 , 2010 , @entity72 crash also exposed numerous other safety shortcomings			2
although @entity72 requires school bus inspections twice a year -- one by the highway patrol and a second by a certified inspection station -- an inspection 10 days before the accident did not reveal faulty brakes on one of the buses , the @entity8 said			1
the faulty brakes were not a factor in the accident , the @entity8 said , because the driver said she did not hit the brakes before the crash			2
but the @entity8 criticized the service station that inspected the brakes , the contract owner of the school buses , and the highway patrol			2
the highway patrol gave the bus company a " @entity175 " before the accident because 100 % of its buses had passed inspection			0
in an unannounced inspection following the tragedy , the pass rate dropped to 60 % , the @entity8 said			2
the @entity8 said both the inspection station and the highway patrol performed inadequate inspections			0
