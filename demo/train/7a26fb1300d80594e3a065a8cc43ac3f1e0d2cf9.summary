-- did the @entity1 kill @entity2 ? no. could the @entity1 have saved @entity2 's life ? perhaps			1
those , at least , were the conclusions of the 192 - page report , the most detailed that a cross parliamentary committee has ever authored , on the gruesome murder of the @entity9 soldier @entity2 by @entity10 converts @entity11 and @entity12 in @entity13 in may 2013			1
in december 2012 , @entity12 expressed his intention on an unnamed social network , reported by many to be @entity17 , to carry out the public execution of a @entity9 soldier			1
but the company hosting this exchange did n't pass on the information to @entity9 intelligence and so the opportunity to pinpoint @entity12 was lost			1
" this was highly significant , " noted @entity25 , the chair of the @entity26 which carried out the 18 - month investigation			2
" had @entity29 had access to this exchange at the time , @entity12 would have become a top priority			2
there is then a significant possibility that @entity29 would have been able to prevent the attack			0
" indeed , the report went as far to suggest that popular networks like @entity17 have become " safe haven for terrorists " because messages sent within their services are n't accessible to @entity9 intelligence agencies like @entity29			1
so what , exactly , should be the responsibility of @entity46 companies when it comes to monitoring the illegal intentions of their users ? they " need to play their part , " insists @entity25			0
" none of the major @entity56 companies we approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems , largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content			1
they appear to accept no responsibility for the services they provide			0
" prime minister @entity67 went even further in condemning @entity46 companies like @entity17 , @entity69 and @entity70			0
" the committee is clear and i agree that they have serious concerns about the approach of a number of communication service providers based overseas , " the @entity67 told @entity71			0
" their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem			1
it is their social responsibility to act on this			0
and we expect them to live up to it			0
" @entity67 's accusations have triggered a predictable storm of outrage			2
some commentators , already paranoid about the supposedly apocalyptic threat of @entity93 terrorism , have accused @entity17 of " having blood on its hands " and of " not giving a monkey 's " about the fate of @entity2			1
others , already paranoid about the role of the @entity9 government in snooping on its citizens , claim " war and tyranny , " rather than @entity17 , which that feeds terrorism and that it 's " dangerous " to blame @entity1 companies for @entity2 's murder			1
the truth , however , is more complex than either side recognizes			0
both @entity25 and @entity67 misunderstand @entity46			0
for all their ideology of making the world a better place , companies like @entity17 are multi-billion dollar big data operations focused on selling advertising around the user - generated - content on their networks			1
they 've never had and never will have any " social responsibility			0
" that 's why @entity17 relies on their unpaid users , rather than paid editors , to monitor suspicious activities : peer - to - peer security is free			1
this its appeal to @entity17			0
but @entity25 and @entity67 also misunderstand contemporary electronic media			0
they assume that it 's a top - down system that , like 20th century postal service or the telephone , can be manageably monitored by state security services like @entity29			2
what they fail to realize is that the explosion of self - broadcasted data from web 2.0 companies like @entity17 has dramatically changed the nature of security and surveillance in the 21st century			2
ninety per cent of all the world 's data has been produced over the last two years and @entity17 users alone are sharing almost 2.5 million pieces of content every minute			1
@entity25 and @entity67 are playing to the xenophobic gallery by suggesting that @entity17 is , somehow , to blame for @entity2 's death			1
we ca n't blame @entity46 for this gruesome public execution any more than we can blame @entity149 or @entity150 for terrorist plots hatched over the telephone			2
but that does n't completely excuse @entity17 , whose unwillingness to actively police the content on its own network is itself deeply troubling			2
two contradictory forces are changing everything about contemporary surveillance and security			0
on the one hand , the state now has the digital tools to watch almost everything that its citizens are doing on the network ; on the other , we are all producing so much data that its beyond the ability of any centralized agency to monitor all this information			1
how we legislate this contradiction by trying to provide " new tools " for our security agencies is critically important			0
it will determine the complexion and boundaries of individual liberty in our networked age .			0

@entity2 's killer posted *online* about wanting to murder a @entity9 soldier
company where message was published did n't pass information to @entity9 authorities

huge amounts of data mean it is beyond ability of any centralized agency to monitor : @entity199
