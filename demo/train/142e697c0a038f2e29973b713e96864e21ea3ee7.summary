-- rarely has an animal birth been more hotly anticipated but the equine answer to the @entity3 has taken its first tentative steps at the home of racing , @entity7 in eastern @entity8			0
on sunday , @entity9 produced the first filly to the superstar stallion @entity12 at the @entity13 , and despite it being just a few days old , the expectation on it to succeed on the racecourse is already huge			1
an anticipated 130 foals will be born to @entity12 in 2014 , none of which will race for two years but with the potential for some sporting sibling rivalry come 2016 at the earliest			1
song is owned by @entity23 , of @entity24 , who paid $ 1.3 million for the mare when she was already in foal to @entity12			1
director of @entity13 @entity28 described the new offspring as " a very nice quality , athletic individual , " adding that both " mare and foal are doing well			0
" there is even footage online of the foal taking some of its first steps in @entity7			0
mother and foal will stay together for at least five months			0
@entity12 earned owner @entity40 , a @entity41 prince , more than $ 4m in prize money during an illustrious racing career , which included a record nine consecutive @entity45 wins and ended with victory in the @entity47 at @entity48 in october last year			2
however , @entity12 , who went to work in his new role at stud in february last year , is now earning his owners infinitely more with a whopping fee of $ 160,000 for every mare sired and hence earnings of nearly four times his career winnings this year alone			2
the offspring of 2001 @entity59 winner @entity57 , @entity12 boasts an impressive pedigree , but predicting how @entity12 foals may fare is by no means an exact science			2
despite the sums paid for the mares and foals in question , she could well prove a flop			0
despite that there are high hopes for the filly and @entity12 's first foal , a colt , born just a few days earlier at @entity75 in @entity76 to a mare called @entity78			1
that colt is valued at Â £ 6m and has been quoted as a 100 - 1 shot to win the @entity81			0
as for the filly foal in @entity7 , she remains unnamed with suggestions for a possible moniker to the offspring of @entity12 and @entity9 , currently including @entity87 or my way .			1
