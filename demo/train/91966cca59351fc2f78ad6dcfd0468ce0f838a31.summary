-- @entity1 and @entity2 are duking it out over the respective battery lives of the @entity5 and the new touch - screen nook			1
the field of battle is the ghostly ground of press releases and promo - page blurb , and the last word seems to have been had by @entity2			2
after @entity2 laid out the specs for its new e-reader , @entity1 took issue with the numbers , saying that @entity2 's claim rested on usage tests of just a half hour of use per day , with wireless switched off			0
@entity1 's usage tests assume an hour of use per day , also with wireless switched off			0
so what did @entity1 do ? it simply doubled the battery life on the product page to reflect a half - hour daily usage			1
wired : @entity2 slims , simplifies @entity28 e-reader @entity2 countered with a very detailed statement , outlining the exact tests made			0
it also looks like the @entity5 was also tested in the same way : " with up to two months on a single charge , the all - new nook has the longest battery life in the industry and superior battery performance to @entity5			1
in our side - by - side tests , under the exact same conditions , continuous use of the device resulted in more than two times @entity5 's battery life			1
" while reading at one page a minute , the all - new nook battery lasts for 150 hours , where the @entity5 battery , using the same page - turn rate , lasts for only 56 hours ( both with @entity48 off )			1
" wired : despite reports , @entity28 competes just fine , thank you we 've also done a continuous page turn test and at one page turn per second , the all - new nook offers more than 25,000 continuous page turns on a single charge			1
i love that @entity2 calls 150 just " two times " 56 , when it could easily say " almost three times			2
" that shows some confidence			0
however this works out , it 's certain that both e-readers have insane battery life compared to any other kind of gadget			2
and if you 're basing your decision on this spec alone , instead of depth of catalog and ease of use , then you 're probably looking in the wrong direction			0
