as president @entity1 presses his case for a strike on @entity4 , a new national survey shows him swimming against a strong tide of public opinion that does n't want the @entity7 to get involved			1
the @entity10 / @entity9 poll released on monday shows that even though eight in 10 @entity7 believe that @entity12 's regime gassed its own people , a strong majority does n't want @entity15 to pass a resolution authorizing a military strike against it			1
more than seven in 10 say such a strike would not achieve significant goals for the @entity7 and a similar amount say it 's not in the national interest for the country to get involved in @entity4 's civil war			1
see complete poll results ( @entity27 ) the poll comes at the start of a pivotal week for the president			1
the @entity31 is expected to take up the resolution after returning from its summer recess on monday while @entity1 participates in a round of interviews with the major television outlets			2
@entity39 's interview with @entity1 will air monday on " @entity40 " at 6 p.m. et. three questions for @entity1 amid a flurry of briefings by @entity45 officials , @entity1 will travel to @entity46 on tuesday to make his case with lawmakers hours before he speaks to the nation in a prime - time address			2
" even as he works members of @entity15 one by one in small group settings , president @entity1 's biggest challenge is the @entity7 public at large , " said @entity51 , @entity10 chief national correspondent			1
" more than seven in 10 @entity7 simply do n't see a military response making any difference			1
they do n't see it doing any good			0
they 're very skeptical , post @entity63 and even post @entity64 and post @entity65 , that the @entity7 can do something in a limited way in the @entity68 and walk away with a success			2
and so the skepticism is driving it right now			0
" the stakes are high for the president			0
after pushing for strikes against @entity4 , @entity1 unexpectedly announced on august 31 that he would ask @entity15 to authorize military action			1
failing to get @entity15 to go along would be an embarrassment for the commander in chief			0
" he 'll go to establishing a new high bar to what it means to being a lame duck this early , " @entity10 contributor and @entity80 strategist @entity78 said			0
" it would be devastating , i think , for rest of his agenda			0
" but @entity90 , another @entity10 contributor who was @entity1 's 2012 deputy campaign manager , said @entity15 's not passing the resolution would be " a blow to the @entity7 , not a blow to the president			1
it 's a blow to the @entity7 ' authority all over the world			2
" " that 's why you 're going to see some members of @entity15 vote for that particular reason			0
some said they 're voting for that particular reason , " she said			0
@entity1 faces steep climb in @entity45 the @entity31 could vote on the resolution as early as wednesday and the outcome there is very much in doubt			2
even more uncertain are prospects in the @entity45 where @entity80 leaders say they 'll wait to see what happens in the @entity31 first			0
" congressional approval would help @entity1 a little , but a majority would still oppose airstrikes against military targets in @entity4 , " @entity10 polling director @entity114 said			1
" if @entity15 authorizes military action , 55 % of @entity7 would still oppose airstrikes			2
" the president has had at least a small majority of public support behind him in conflicts involving the @entity7 over the past 20 years			1
eighty - six percent of those surveyed in a @entity10 / @entity128 / @entity127 poll less than a month after the 9/11 terror attacks favored military action , and 56 % backed the @entity7 and its allies in creating a " no - fly " zone over @entity64 in 2011			1
only @entity7 involvement in @entity134 airstrikes on @entity135 in 1999 during the @entity137 administration split the public down the middle , with 43 % supporting involvement and 40 % opposing it			2
' this is not @entity63 or @entity143 ' while 64 % supported using @entity7 ground troops in @entity63 in 2003 , intelligence indicating @entity146 was building weapons of mass destruction was later discredited			1
that has contributed to public doubts about @entity1 administration claims of evidence showing that @entity12 's regime gassed its own people on august 21 outside @entity155 , killing more than 1,400 people			1
fifty - nine percent of people questioned say they do n't think @entity15 should approve a proposed resolution authorizing military action against @entity4 for up to 90 days -- an initial 60 - day window plus another 30 following congressional notification -- but prohibiting the use of ground troops			2
about 40 % support that plan			0
if @entity15 rejects the @entity4 resolution , the @entity45 has said that the president still has the authority to strike			1
" i think it would be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate because right now i 'm working to get as much support as possible out of @entity15 , " @entity1 said on friday when asked by @entity10 senior @entity45 correspondent @entity167 what he would do if the resolution failed			2
but the poll indicates @entity7 are quite clear on that point : more than seven in 10 say they would oppose @entity7 airstrikes against @entity4 if @entity15 does not authorize it			1
who are the @entity4 rebels ? the debate over @entity4 has caused intra-party divides among both parties : hawkish @entity80 and moderate democrats say the @entity7 should strike , while the libertarian wing of the @entity80 says involvement is not in the @entity7 interest			1
liberal democrats say there are alternatives to military action that have n't been exhausted			0
the poll also suggests those surveyed who identified themselves as @entity184 and @entity80 do n't see eye to eye on the resolution			0
fifty - six percent of @entity184 think @entity15 should pass it , but only 36 % of @entity80 and 29 % of independents say the same			0
" bringing @entity15 into the equation seems to have added a political dimension to the @entity4 debate , " @entity114 said			0
" once @entity15 makes up its mind , however , the gap between @entity184 and @entity80 nearly vanishes			0
" ' @entity204 ' survives on loyalty , brutality if @entity15 does authorize military action , the gap between @entity184 and @entity80 shrinks to just four points , with 51 % of @entity184 and 47 % of @entity80 favoring military action			0
and if @entity15 rejects the resolution authorizing military action , large numbers in both parties oppose airstrikes			0
" it appears that while the debate is still in the hands of @entity15 , politics will affect @entity7 ' views on @entity4 , " @entity114 said			1
" politics may still stop at the water 's edge for most @entity7 , but @entity46 remains a highly partisan environment , even when international affairs are being debated			0
" the poll gives some insight into why many @entity7 oppose action			2
while more than eight in 10 say that it 's likely or certain that the @entity4 government used chemical weapons , nearly seven in 10 say that it 's not in the @entity7 national interest to get involved in @entity4 's civil war			1
and more than seven in 10 say that airstrikes would not achieve significant goals for the @entity7 @entity4 's neighbors on edge and while most of those questioned said that how their members of @entity15 voted on the resolution would n't affect how they voted in future elections , but the remainder by a nearly 3 - 1 margin said they would be more likely to vote against the lawmakers if they supported the resolution			1
the @entity10 poll was conducted by @entity9 on september 6 - 8 , with 1,022 adult americans questioned by telephone			0
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .			0

7 in 10 poll respondents say they do n't think a strike on @entity4 would achieve @entity7 goals
poll comes at beginning of a pivotal week for president @entity1
the president has had at least a small majority behind him in recent conflicts
about eight in 10 believe @entity12 regime is or is likely behind chemical weapons attack
