-- @entity1 , a comedian from the golden era of television , died thursday			1
the funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a @entity8 hospice , said @entity9 , sales ' longtime friend and manager			2
" we have lost a comedy @entity14 icon , " @entity9 said			1
" i feel the personal loss , and i also feel the magic that he had around him being gone			0
that 's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend			0
" sales was known for his long - running children 's show " lunch with @entity1 , " which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie - throwing antics			1
the comedy show featured skits that culminated in sales getting walloped with pies in the face			1
what are your memories of sales ? " @entity1 was the last of the great tv comics when you talk about @entity39 , @entity40 , right down to @entity41 , " @entity9 said			0
" but it was bigger than that , because he used a children 's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids ' show and do a wild , unrehearsed , wacky improv for a half - hour every day for 15 years			1
" he could also inflame the authorities			0
one @entity53 , upset at being asked to work , he asked his youthful audience to send him those " green pieces of paper " from their parents ' wallets			0
though he did n't receive much -- he told the @entity59 he received only a few dollars -- he was suspended for a week for the prank			0
later in his career , he was a regular on tv game shows , such as " @entity64 , " " to @entity65 " and " what 's my line ? " sales recently fell backstage at a local emmy awards show in @entity8 and developed serious ailments after that , @entity9 said .			2
