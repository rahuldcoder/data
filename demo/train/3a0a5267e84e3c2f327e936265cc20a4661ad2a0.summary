-- as rockets fly in @entity2 and @entity3 , a shareable and ready - to - retweet version of the violence is playing out online			1
official military accounts for the @entity7 and the military wing of @entity9 have been posting slick - looking , social - media - friendly graphics in an effort to sway public opinion			1
here 's one example from @entity3 , retweeted some 2,600 times : and another from @entity9 , retweeted more than 350 times : notice that both sides want internet users to " share this " or " share now			1
" that 's a new concept for militaries that are engaged in active conflict , writes @entity23 for @entity24			2
" unlike any propaganda machine before it , it 's inherently viral			2
it 's designed to spread , " he wrote			2
the @entity7 's tweets " are a mixture of documentation , saber rattling , sober reminders of the reality of war , and upbeat updates on the advanced state of its technology			2
all delivered direct to you			0
please @entity42 " but as both sides seek to distort the reality of a conflict that has killed three @entity3 and more than two dozen @entity47 , they could have taken a lesson from social media history : online marketing campaigns tend to backfire , at least in part			1
" on one level , it makes sense for the military to use the internet to provide useful information and possibly even explain its mission to the public			0
( they have @entity62 and @entity63 - language versions of the account too , for added global reach			0
) , " writes @entity66 for @entity67			0
" but the odd tone of the writing , has taken some people aback and left the @entity7 open to mockery and charges of insensitivity regarding a very sensitive subject			0
" the people of the @entity75 have started using the same tools as @entity3 and @entity9 to mock the idea of a military broadcasting live information about itself on social platforms			1
" @entity7 announced the war on @entity81 , warned @entity82 thru @entity83 & troops showed us action on @entity87			0
" wrote one @entity81 user , @ the_47th			0
" @entity3 is the @entity89 of nations			1
" in response to @entity9 ' death toll image , one @entity81 user wrote : " so be * real * heroes for your people - stop firing back			1
restraint is what requires real courage			0
" the jabs -- some humorous , some serious -- show how difficult it can be to control the conversation in an era of real - time media			2
here 's one of the more - discussed critiques of @entity3 's social media campaign , in which a writer for the site @entity24 created a fake tweet from the @entity7 : that post , in which the author appears to mock use of social media , also raised questions about humor during a violent conflict , and the authenticity of information on social networks			1
" does a journalist faking a tweet from an official govt account cross a line ? " asked @entity120 , a writer at @entity121			0
@entity24 's co-founder came to the defense of that tweet 's author : some criticism takes a more serious tone			2
" the @entity81 / @entity24 friendly media strategy of @entity7 this time -- big infographics , tweets made to go viral etc -- scares the hell out of me , " @entity132 wrote on @entity81			0
and others fear the tit - for - tat could actually escalate the conflict			0
" this is a new reality of war , " @entity142 , from the @entity141 , told the @entity143			0
" and i worry that it 's going to make it harder to stand down			0
" there already have been some efforts to quantify who is winning the war on social media			1
@entity9 wins when it comes to the use of its hashtag , writes a blogger for the @entity158			1
@entity3 is winning the follower count battle , says @entity24			1
but there are also , of course , voices in the middle			0
@entity164 , a senior strategist at @entity165 , has been aggregating and retweeting people in both @entity3 and @entity2			1
those posts , and others from journalists on the ground tend to show a grittier reality of the violence in the @entity173 : let us know what you think of the social media tactics in the comments .			1

@entity3 and @entity9 release shareable images on social media
in some ways , that 's backfired , with the @entity75 mocking the posts
