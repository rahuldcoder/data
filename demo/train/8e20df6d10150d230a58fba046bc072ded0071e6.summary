-- sometimes i think the media live in a time warp			1
there 's so much talk about @entity6 and the expanding / shrinking / expanding field of possible @entity10 candidates , you 'd think we 're in the middle of an @entity14 ratings battle			1
the media focus on 2016 is like a " @entity16 , " without @entity17			1
it 's really an obsession that is not only misguided but also does a disservice both to voters and candidates			1
the two - year out speculation track record is pretty bad			2
yes , @entity24 is dynamic			1
even her most rabid detractors must admit that			2
but her dynamism is not a guarantee victory			2
her nomination is not inevitable			2
she knows upfront the toll campaigning demands and what being president exacts			0
as @entity35 said about being a @entity36 , you have to give your nervous system			0
if @entity24 decides to run , she has to do so knowing it is a commitment that may last 11 years			1
( @entity39 , 71 , and @entity40 , 58 , also have to consider their age			0
) it 's not just how old a person might be at the end of her , or his , term			1
the question is , will one have the energy and will power to finish the job ? we age better and healthier , but being president is aging like nothing else			0
@entity24 's understudy waits in the wings does @entity24 want to make a time commitment that could amount to the rest of her life ? another factor surely affecting @entity24 's decision is her legacy			1
despite repeated attempts by @entity10 , she remains very popular			0
in a 2013 @entity64 she was named the woman people most admired			0
a presidential run would risk that popularity -- and the legacy she 's built as a senator and secretary of state ( not to mention former first lady )			1
of course , she could also leverage that popularity to lead our nation in a great new direction			0
potential candidates may also weigh on her mind			0
who else might run if she does n't ? if the rest of the field looks weak , she might feel a sense of duty to her party and her country			1
if there are strong " next generation " candidates , she may be content , perhaps glad , to work for their success			0
the point is that there are factors that may induce @entity6 not to run , and nobody will know what will influence her decision -- until she decides			1
speculation about @entity10 candidates is even sketchier			0
@entity100 gov. @entity99 , who only a few weeks ago seemed the prime - time contender , now appears on the ropes			1
other prominent @entity10 have also taken their hits recently -- understandable , given the current fighting among the factions			0
so , who knows ? i can make one prediction safely : going through the list of who 's up and who 's down until the nomination ( s ) is ( are ) secured will make any roller coaster ride seem like a walk in the park			1
i 've got a name for the media 's obsession with potential 2016 nominees , or really any idle speculation without substance -- talking - head - vacuum syndrome			1
instead of acting like junior high gossips though , the media might try focusing on real issues that are current and important			1
there are lots of them out there			0
i 'll focus on one example			0
two years ago saw a breakthrough for women officeholders			0
i 've written about this before : there are now 20 women senators			0
one of the big questions in 2014 is : can @entity137 retain control of the @entity139 ? " conventional wisdom " held that it would be tough			1
but the game is changing , thanks to a couple of dynamic women candidates			0
in @entity147 , which has been a @entity148 @entity10 stronghold -- since 2010 , they 've held every statewide office -- @entity150 , daughter of former sen. @entity151 , stands a good chance of becoming another woman senator -- and a @entity137 one			0
parsing @entity39 's words : if @entity6 runs , he wo n't she is leading or tied with all her opponents in the polls			1
she has the advantages of a famous name in @entity147 , a middle - of - the road message and lots of campaign discipline			0
her father was known for his bipartisanship and reaching across the aisle -- and she 's already following in his footsteps			1
and although @entity147 is staunchly conservative , the state 's demographics are shifting , with more african - americans returning and the immigrant population growing			2
then there 's the race in @entity173 , where @entity175 @entity174 holds a lead of 4 percentage points over senate minority leader @entity178			2
@entity179 is arguably the most powerful @entity10 in the @entity139 , and if his seat -- if a seat in @entity173 is up for grabs -- the dynamics of the @entity139 need to be re-examined			0
trust me , if those two women win their seats , the ripple effect will become a tidal wave			0
and there are other races where women have raised the stakes			2
@entity195 ' bid to be governor of @entity197 has drawn national attention and already reframed several of the issues in that state			2
my point is that we 're more than 1,000 days away from the inauguration of the next president , and there 's a lot going on now that needs more attention from the media			1
this year could become a breakthrough for women in @entity212 politics			0
let 's give that the coverage it deserves			2
the 2016 election can wait			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 says the media is *spending* way too much time focusing on @entity6
@entity219 : @entity24 's possible presidential run in 2016 is not guaranteed
there are other races in 2014 that deserve media attention right now , she says
