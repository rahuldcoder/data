-- here 's a thought to chew on : @entity3 's most intractable problems all double back to our collective mistreatment of animals			1
sounds crazy , right ? well , humor me for a minute			0
our own lives would improve if we started showing some basic decency to the 9 billion cows , calves , pigs , lambs , turkeys and chickens that are slaughtered a year in the @entity3			1
more than 99 % of farm animals in the @entity3 are raised in factory farms , many unable to even turn around in small cages			1
a slew of investigations by @entity22 , @entity23 and the @entity24 have uncovered repeated instances of vicious abuse of animals headed for slaughter			1
the latest @entity30 undercover investigation of a large veal calf slaughterhouse in @entity32 showed abuse too gruesome to display on television and resulted in the temporary shutdown of the facility by the @entity3 @entity37			1
" animal abuse is the norm in the meat industry , " says @entity38 , vice president of farm animal protection at the @entity30			1
" many standard practices in animal agribusiness are so cruel that they 're just out of step with mainstream @entity3 values about how animals ought to be treated			1
" the society cites piglet tail docking and castration without anesthesia , the confinement of pigs to crates where they can not turn around and cutting off the beaks of egg - laying hens before they 're confined to tiny cages			0
if all of this sounds hideous , it is			0
and here 's how it hurts us humans			0
the obesity crisis : two thirds of @entity3 adults are overweight or obese			1
the @entity68 has declared obesity a chronic disease in an attempt to get a grip on what some label the 21st century plague			2
a recent study published in the @entity77 shows that kids who are overweight in kindergarten are often condemned to future obesity			0
it also showed obesity is highest in the poorest socioeconomic sectors of society , further hobbling already disadvantaged kids			0
the rise of obesity has paralleled the rise of fast food , laden with meat and dairy products : burgers and shakes			2
obesity affects every aspect of a people 's lives , from health to relationships			2
less fast food would help stop the obesity epidemic and would also mean raising and killing fewer animals			1
a 2010 study published in the @entity104 concluded , " a plant - based diet seems to be a sensible approach for the prevention of obesity in children			1
" the health care crisis : the myriad of serious health risks resulting from poor diet include high cholesterol , heart disease , type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , stroke and even sleep apnea			1
eating too much meat and dairy products , combined with excessive intake of sugars and starch , plays a big role in these medical issues			0
cholesterol does not exist in vegetables			0
vegetables do not clog arteries			0
a report by the @entity132 says we could save 100,000 lives and $ 17 billion in health care costs from heart disease every year if @entity3 ate more fruits and vegetables			1
the report begs @entity139 to slash farm policies that subsidize @entity142 's massive production of junk and fast food			2
critics say the $ 956 billion farm bill that just passed is simply a bait and switch that cuts direct subsidies but replaces them with generous crop insurance			0
that brings us to money			0
the deficit : skyrocketing health care costs are a key factor in the ballooning deficit			2
the yearly medical costs of obesity are estimated to be as high as $ 190 billion a year , according to a study reported in the @entity160 , with expenditures of almost $ 1,200 more a year to treat obese @entity3 compared with those of normal weight			1
natural disasters : extreme weather phenomena is on the rise leading to more massive , destructive storms as a result of climate change			0
@entity170 alone cost $ 70 billion in damage and lost economic productivity			0
meat production is one of the leading causes of climate change because of the destruction of the rainforest for grazing lands , the massive amounts of methane produced by farm animals and the huge amounts of water , grain and other resources required to feed animals the @entity174 @entity173 found the production of meat contributes from 14 % and 22 % of the world 's greenhouse gases			1
hunger : every five seconds a child dies somewhere in the world of malnutrition or starvation			0
world hunger could be eliminated if all the produce fed to cows , chickens and pigs raised for human consumption was distributed directly to hungry humans			2
@entity206 , who is championing meat alternatives in his " @entity209 " project , puts it succinctly when he notes : " for every 10 kilograms of grain we feed cattle , we get 1 kilogram of beef in return			2
the calorie kick - back is just too low to feed a growing world population			2
" some of the smartest people in @entity3 , from @entity219 to @entity206 , are starting to see the big picture			2
@entity219 , after having quadruple bypass surgery and later stents to open his veins , publicly adopted a plant - based diet			1
@entity206 , in his @entity209 project , sums up the unsustainability of our food system succinctly , noting : " raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact			1
put simply , there 's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people			0
" the human population of @entity240 is expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050			0
now , it 's time for the rest of us to wake up and vote with our shopping carts			0
@entity3 taxpayers and consumers are being exploited right along with the animals			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			0

@entity250 : almost all farm animals in the @entity3 are raised in factory farms
@entity250 : animal abuse and cruelty is the norm in the meat industry
she says meat production leads to obesity , disease , high health costs , *pollution*
she says raising meat uses huge amount of energy ; plant based diet could feed the world
