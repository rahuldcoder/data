@entity0 -- as an 8 a.m. ferry made its final maneuvers across the @entity5 , @entity2 clutched her hand - bag and made small talk with other commuters			2
then it all went black			0
when she woke up , the 26 - year - old @entity11 native was in pain and on the floor with the wind knocked out of her , about six feet from where she had been standing			1
" it felt like an elephant landed on me , " she said			0
the high - speed ferry that serves as @entity22 's normal commute slammed into a @entity24 pier near @entity25 around 8:45 a.m. wednesday			1
scores were left bloodied and writhing in agony as emergency crews rushed to the scene			0
" once i was able to catch my breath , i got up and it was very scary , " @entity22 said			0
packed with 326 passengers and five crew members , the vessel tossed people like rag dolls as it slammed to a halt , flinging those aboard into the air and against walls , seats and windows , according to several witnesses			1
" i saw a lot of bleeding heads with white bandages ( and ) a lot of people strapped to boards , " said passerby @entity43			2
" it felt like we were in a car crash , " said passenger @entity50 , who watched in horror as medical personnel began triage on at least 85 injured people			1
two were initially listed in critical condition as emergency crews rushed the wounded on stretchers to hospitals			0
but by wednesday evening , authorities said only one person 's condition remained critical			0
it was not immediately clear what caused the crash			2
the @entity67 deployed a team to the scene and planned to more fully undertake their investigation on thursday			0
as the vessel approached @entity24 's @entity73 , witnesses said , unsuspecting commuters had gotten up from their seats and packed closer to the ferry exits and atop stairwells -- a typical occurrence at the end of their 40 - minute commute			1
but the perches may have magnified the effects of the crash , as passengers careened down stairwells and against windows			2
" we know that they hit the pier at a relatively high rate of speed , " said @entity88 capt. @entity87 , who estimated that the boat had been traveling at about 14 knots , or 16 mph			1
@entity22 said the vessel seemed to be " going pretty fast for a boat that was supposed to be docking			0
" after the crash , the front of the ship bore a large gash			2
the ferry , privately operated by @entity103 , provides daily service between @entity105 and @entity106 in @entity11 to piers in @entity24			1
" our thoughts and prayers are with those that were injured , " @entity103 said in a written statement , adding that it would work with authorities to determine the cause			1
thirty - one people were transported to @entity0 's @entity117			2
of those , all were considered non-critical and were expected to be released wednesday			0
this is not the first time this vessel has been involved in a crash			0
@entity88 records indicate that the same @entity103 ferry in 2009 slammed into a @entity11 dock and tore a 2 - to 3 - foot gash in the starboard bow of the vessel			1
a year later , a collision with a dock pile punctured a hole in the port side of the same boat			0
wednesday 's crash also drew comparisons to an unrelated 2010 incident when a ferry with mechanical problems crashed into the @entity141 terminal , injuring 36 people			1
that ferry was the same vessel involved in an october 2003 crash that killed 11 people and injured 42 , considered one of the worst ferry accidents in @entity0 's recent history			1
@entity1 's @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
