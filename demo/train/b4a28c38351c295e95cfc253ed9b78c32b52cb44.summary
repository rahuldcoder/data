-- @entity3 mayor @entity2 , accused of sexually harassing women , will resign if the @entity5 accepts a proposed mediation agreement , local tv stations reported thursday			1
the resignation would be effective friday , according to the stations , including @entity0 affiliate @entity9			0
" it is still our understanding that his resignation is part of the deal that the @entity5 needs to sign off on during tomorrow 's closed session , " an official familiar with the negotiations told @entity0 's @entity11			0
the source emphasized that " until that happens , i do n't believe you will see an official resignation			0
" city councilman @entity23 said he had not seen the agreement , but is hopeful it includes a resignation , @entity9 reported			2
" the quicker he 's out of office , the quicker it is to get back into city business , " @entity23 told the station			0
@entity2 has been under intense pressure to resign in the wake of allegations of serial sexual harassment of women , including inappropriate touching , kissing and comments			1
he has acknowledged improper conduct and recently underwent therapy			0
but he has previously resisted the resignation demands , saying his conduct was not enough to force him from office			0
he even has been locked out of his @entity46 office , though @entity2 indicated in a statement that he returned to work as mayor in that very office on wednesday			1
that was the same day that , according to @entity2 and others involved , three days of mediation talks yielded a tentative agreement			1
city councilors and others have been reluctant publicly to divulge details on the deal , given the guidelines set by the judge overseeing the mediation talks			1
@entity2 , for example , said in a statement thursday , " due to the confidential nature of mediation and settlement discussions , we are unable to comment or make statements about any of the terms			1
" city council president @entity68 , who is among the nine @entity5 members calling for a resignation , was similarly tight - lipped			0
but that should change sometime after the @entity5 meets -- after a public comment period -- in a closed session around 1 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et ) friday to decide on whatever pact is on the table			0
" the business of the city of @entity3 is being pushed forward as best we can , " councilman @entity76 said , adding that the last seven weeks have been " very difficult " but have n't stopped the city government from functioning			0
" we love our city			0
" whatever the final deal is , lawyer @entity82 -- who represents @entity2 's former communications chief @entity83 , who has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former boss , and who has spoken alongside several other accusers -- said thursday that she hopes it includes not only his resignation , but no future payments to him for legal fees or otherwise			1
" there should be no payoff for mayor @entity2 , " @entity82 told reporters thursday			1
" his parting gift should be good riddance instead of a handout			0
" @entity82 said that while she took part in the mediation talks , neither she nor her client signed off on any deal , nor did she have details on it			1
she stressed that @entity106 has not dropped her case against @entity2 , saying , " our lawsuit is not settled			1
" out of rehab , locked out of the office news of the reported mediation agreement comes after yet another woman came forward to accuse @entity2			1
businesswoman @entity115 told @entity0 that @entity2 put his hands on her buttocks during a photo opportunity that followed a meeting three months ago			2
@entity120 said there were witnesses to what happened			0
she said both her advisers and @entity2 's were in the room at the time			2
did mayor target victims of military sexual assault ? @entity120 is the 18th woman to accuse @entity2 of improper conduct			1
@entity106 quit her job and sued the mayor in july , saying he subjected women to " crude and disgusting " comments and inappropriate touching			2
other women have accused him of touching their buttocks and putting them in a headlock and trying to kiss them , among other allegations			2
and amid the storm of allegations , @entity141 ended her engagement to @entity2			2
she had campaigned alongside him during his run for mayor , and was known -- even though the two were n't married -- as the " first lady " of @entity3 before ending their relationship			2
but speaking thursday alongside @entity82 in her first public comments since the scandal broke , @entity150 said she now wants @entity2 to resign as mayor			1
" i 'm hopeful that tomorrow will begin a healing process , " @entity150 told reporters , " and that attention will return to the needs of the people			0
