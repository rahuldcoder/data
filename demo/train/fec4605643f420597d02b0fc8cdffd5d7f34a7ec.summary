the father of @entity1 has offered federal authorities a deal that he says would likely lead the accused leaker to return voluntarily to the @entity5 to face espionage charges			1
the proposal was laid out in a letter , dated thursday and obtained friday by @entity10 's " @entity9 , " addressed to attorney general @entity11 and written by @entity12 , a @entity13 - based lawyer for @entity1 's father , @entity14			1
it demands that the former @entity17 computer contractor who exposed details about @entity5 surveillance programs remain free prior to trial ; not be subject to a gag order ; and be tried in a place of his choosing			1
it further demands that , if any of those promises is broken , the prosecution would be dismissed			0
read the letter " with these written representations and guarantee , mr. @entity1 is reasonably confident that his son could be persuaded to surrender voluntarily to the jurisdiction of the @entity5 to face trial , " @entity12 wrote			1
the @entity35 has no immediate comment			0
in comments friday to @entity38 ' " today , " the elder @entity1 said he had not spoken with his son since april			2
" i love him , i would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him			0
i do n't want to put him in peril , but i am concerned about those who surround him , " he said			0
though the 30 - year - old man may have betrayed his government , " i do n't believe he has betrayed the people of the @entity5 , " he said			0
he expressed concern that his son might have been manipulated by @entity51			0
" their focus is n't necessarily the @entity54 of the @entity5 , " he said			0
" it 's simply to release as much information as possible			2
" a day after authorities in @entity60 said they would not bow to @entity5 pressure as they weigh @entity1 's request for asylum , @entity58 spokesman @entity57 denied any " bullying " tactics had been used			1
" the point is just that we are making a consistent point to any government that might take him as a final destination that this is somebody wanted on serious felony charges and we would like him returned to the @entity5 , " @entity57 told reporters friday in response to a question from @entity10 's @entity69			2
@entity78 : pay no attention to that man we ca n't capture he was referring to his warning thursday that @entity60 's economic ties with the @entity5 could be jeopardized			1
" what would not be a good thing is them granting mr. @entity1 asylum , " @entity57 had said			1
" that would have grave difficulties for a bilateral relationship			0
" @entity57 then cited trade agreements the @entity5 has extended to @entity60			2
" they 're unilateral trade provisions that provide a benefit to certain @entity60 products , " @entity57 said			2
" whether they 're renewed or not is a prerogative of the @entity98			0
" asked about that remark , @entity57 said friday , " i would n't call it a threat			0
i 'd say that , you know , we are making the same points in public that we are making in private -- that this is somebody accused of serious crimes that we want returned			0
" the warning sparked a strong response on thursday from @entity60 's president , @entity110 , at an event in @entity112			1
" it is outrageous to try to delegitimize a state for receiving a petition of asylum , " said the left - leaning economist who is known for decrying what he and other @entity115 leaders have called @entity5 imperialism			2
and on friday , the @entity122 of @entity60 announced that the country had suspended its support for the @entity125 , which provided duty - free treatment for certain products			1
@entity5 asks @entity60 to reject any asylum request from @entity1 " as we have stated previously , any political or economic consequences of our decision regarding the asylum request are outweighed by our legal and humanitarian obligations , " an embassy statement said			1
last year , @entity60 granted asylum to @entity51 founder @entity135 , who remains in the nation 's embassy in @entity138			1
@entity60 's rationale appeared to have won support from former @entity5 president @entity141			1
if another country wants to give haven to @entity1 , " then that is their right as a sovereign nation , " he told @entity10 's @entity147			1
" if the @entity5 can acquire custody of him , i 'm sure he will be brought to trial , and that 's the way the law should be implemented			2
" @entity1 's acts may have some positive impact , @entity141 said			1
" he 's obviously violated the laws of @entity5 , for which he 's responsible , but i think the invasion of human rights and @entity115 privacy has gone too far , " he said			0
" i think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive , so i think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been , in the long term , beneficial			0
" asked to elaborate , he said , " i think the @entity115 people deserve to know what their @entity98 is doing			0
" @entity1 has been at @entity169 's international airport since sunday , when he arrived from @entity170			2
@entity171 furious , ' shocked ' by report of @entity5 spying			0
