-- the games begin thursday , and @entity3 buzz will soon take over the lunchroom			1
everywhere you turn , co-workers will chat about their favorite teams , the upsets , the injuries			2
maybe you will watch the games			2
but maybe , irrespective of whether you plan to follow the tournament , you 've ponied up to be part of the office pool			1
and you do n't have to worry about explaining how you made your picks while filling out out your bracket			2
everyone is hoping to choose that one team that comes from behind to win			2
so what if you always pick @entity20 just because you like saying the name ? should it matter if you take @entity23 out of the running just because that jerk who once strung you along came from there ? you are in the running like everyone else , and , heck , you might surprise yourself and actually win			2
in these coming weeks , though , you do n't want to sound like an idiot			2
it would be nice , you think to yourself , if you actually appeared to know what you were talking about			2
@entity0 reached out to @entity33 , a senior writer at @entity35 who covers basketball , as well as sports fans in the @entity0 newsroom to get some tips for how you can bluff your way through the tournament			1
with their sage advice , we offer this wisdom : be careful not to talk about a " buzzer beater " unless it 's actually happened			2
when they do happen , when a player scores at the buzzer ( in the last second ) to change the game 's outcome , throw the term around wildly			2
it 'll be what everyone is reliving , and if you feel especially bold , you can try to give someone a high - five while saying , " how about that buzzer beater ? " discussing injuries in vague terms is always safe , since most every team has suffered some			1
ideas : " they really ca n't afford any more injuries this season			0
" or , " did n't they have a big injury this year ? " you do n't have to know the answer , but it 's an easy way to engage with a sports nut who will gladly tell you more about some stranger 's ankle than you ever wanted to know			0
tell people around the water cooler that you really admire a team 's " tenacity			0
" @entity33 says that 's " a good fastball no one can argue with , " because by virtue of making it to the tournament , a team 's got to have some serious tenacity			1
other terms you can throw around to describe a team : " smart , " " experienced " and " well - coached			1
" something called " guard play " is apparently very big this time of year			0
you might shake your head and mutter , " i do n't know if their guard play is good enough			1
" or , conversely , you can say , " oh , yeah , i think they have a good chance because they 've got good guard play			1
" there are some things you might say that could be risky , as they may prompt others to ask you a question in return			0
for example , if you were to say , " gosh , that was a big shot , " someone might ask , " which one ? " this would be a good time to spill your coffee , diverting attention			1
in basketball , the word " press " ( short for pressure ) is used when discussing defense			1
so you might want to express your heartfelt concern about a team " having trouble with the press			1
" there are different conferences that make up the @entity124			1
the @entity125 dominated this year			0
you can talk about how the " @entity125 ruled , " but make sure you do n't misspeak and talk about the @entity126 , because no such thing exists			0
there is a @entity126 10 , but it 's made up of 11 teams			0
" @entity132 " refers to how a team passes a ball			1
any team that 's made it to the " tourney , " as some insiders like to say , must be strong in this realm			0
so you can assume you 're covered if you say something like , " wow , they have great ball movement			1
" a strong three - point game can make the difference for an underdog team			0
so if some folks are saying how a team does n't have a chance , you could nonchalantly stroll by and say in passing , " they could pull an upset if they get hot shooting threes			0
" another fun phrase to toss out : " they live or die by the three			0
" casting blame on referees for making " questionable calls " is highly popular			0
" man , there were some questionable calls " is a good gripe to share , but only if the game was close			1
if it was a " blowout , " a win by a large margin , your saying this would make you look foolish			0
it might be better to say , if people are chatting about an upcoming game , " man , i hope the refs just let them play			0
" word is that everyone loves a " @entity174 , " the team that comes out of nowhere to make a good run in the tournament			1
if you want to sound especially savvy , use it in conjunction with the world " dance , " another fun slang term for @entity3 , as in , " it 's always nice to see @entity174 go deep in the dance			1
" if you feel compelled to throw out a player 's name , one you 're pretending to be excited to watch , the one to know -- and one that 's easy to remember -- is @entity188			0
rhymes with ball , if that helps			1
he 's a freshman guard at @entity193 and will likely go pro soon , so using his name next year during @entity3 would blow your cover			0
last , and this is very important , do not -- repeat -- do not walk into work on april 1 and talk about how crestfallen you are that @entity3 is over			0
the tournament goes by this name , but the actual championship is played in april			2
@entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed their wisdom to this very important report .			0
