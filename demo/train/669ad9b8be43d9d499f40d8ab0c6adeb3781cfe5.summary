as major airlines and the @entity2 relax their rules on using electronic devices during takeoff and landing , one important question lingers : what will become of airplane mode ? the common smartphone feature , which disables cellular , wireless , @entity11 , and gps connections so you can use your mobile device while in the air , may be outgrowing its name			1
airlines quick to ease electronics rules the @entity20 is having fun coming up with new names for airplane mode that reflect broader uses for the feature			1
@entity26 at the @entity27 offers @entity29 mode			2
other suggestions include @entity32 mode , @entity34 mode , @entity36 mode or hermit mode			0
airplane mode is more than just a necessity at 30,000 feet -- it 's become a tool for severing ourselves from the demands of constant connectiveness			1
and with some enhancements , airplane mode could help us all put some much needed boundaries between our online and offline lives , our work and personal time			1
despite the @entity2 rule changes , airplane mode is n't actually going anywhere			1
it still serves its original purpose , because making calls will continue to be forbidden ( and probably impossible ) while in flight			0
the new rules just mean you can play games or use an e-reader during takeoff instead of having to flip through the in - flight magazine , chat with the person next to you or be alone with your thoughts			0
can your cell phone bring down a plane ? outside of flying , people have found many creative uses for airplane mode			1
they use it to quickly disconnect before movies , meetings , dinners and other events where silent mode is n't enough			1
when traveling internationally , keeping a phone on airplane mode and turning on @entity79 can prevent cellular bills bloated with roaming charges			1
people who use their tablets for work can employ @entity85 to avoid distractions like surfing the web or checking @entity88			1
toggling airplane mode on and off can even act as a quick fix for connection problems			1
the setting is also used by people who want to rein in their own smartphone use , say to tune out the outside world without actually parting with their precious handheld computers			0
with smartphones , people check and send work e-mails at all hours			2
according to @entity102 's annual " @entity103 " survey , 67 % of @entity100 adults stay connected while on vacation and 76 % check their e-mail and voice mail			0
a recent @entity108 ad campaign for @entity109 uses the need to work remotely and around the clock as a selling point			0
" office workers want technology to help them get things done anywhere , sunrise to sunset , " reads the tagline			0
illustrations show people working on mobile devices while on a date , during a kid 's soccer game , and during a stroll through a national park			2
there 's been lots of talk around " unplugging " for parts of every day or week , but this all - or - nothing approach does n't sit well with a generation of smartphone users who are dependent on their devices			2
@entity138 clearly is n't working			0
airplane mode offers a partial solution , but it 's still too simple			1
so how about this : what if phones offered parental control - like settings that could be scheduled and set for individual apps and features ? access to work e-mail could be cut off at 7 p.m. social networking apps , games and other time - sucks could be banned on weekends			0
someone on vacation could limit access so only the phone 's camera , maps , restaurant reviews , translation apps and travel e-books were available			0
in its new @entity162 , @entity161 added a @entity164 feature that gives some control but mostly applies to phone calls			0
it can automatically silence incoming calls and alerts , either during prescheduled times or on demand			0
a reverse do - not - disturb feature that only allows phone calls and texts ( let 's call it a dumb phone mode ) could be a refreshing break			2
many people want to disconnect -- they just need a little help			2
so future smartphones might include even more options for reclaiming personal time and restoring some of the work / life balance			1
