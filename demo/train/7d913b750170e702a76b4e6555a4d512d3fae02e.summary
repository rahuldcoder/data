-- @entity1 could face @entity3 disciplinary action over his handball which helped @entity5 to qualify for the finals of the @entity7 at the expense of @entity9			1
@entity3 president @entity10 told reporters in @entity12 that the @entity16 striker 's " blatant unfair play " could land him in hot water			1
" the @entity3 disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player @entity1 , " he said			1
" it was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world			0
i do n't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee , let them make the decision			2
" fair play must be maintained in our game			0
" @entity10 was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the @entity3 executive committee , which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the @entity5 - @entity34 match , incidents surrounding the @entity38 - @entity37 playoff tie and matchfixing in @entity40			1
it had been widely trailed that the @entity3 executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in @entity46			1
but @entity10 said that the finals in @entity48 was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second - tier @entity51 club tournament this year			2
" the experiments with the @entity53 shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided , for the @entity46 2010 , there is no change in the refereeing : one referee , two assistants and a fourth official			0
" he went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees			2
" we shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone , it will be done by the football , technical and medical committees , too , " he added			0
@entity34 were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because @entity1 used his hand to control the ball before setting up @entity80 to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the @entity5			0
@entity34 subsequently launched two appeals , the first for the match to be replayed , the second for them to be added to the line - up for the finals as the 33rd team			1
both have been rejected , but @entity10 was forced to apologize to the @entity92 for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team			2
@entity10 put their request into the public domain in light - hearted comments made in @entity98 , which left @entity100 football officials infuriated and insulted			1
" i would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what i said			0
i regret what i have created and i 'm sorry to the @entity9 football confederation for these headlines going around the world , " he said			0
" it 's a pity i communicated in this way			0
