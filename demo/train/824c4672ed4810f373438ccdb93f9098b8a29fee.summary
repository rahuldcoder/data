-- the @entity1 announced monday it will not overturn the penalty it previously imposed against the @entity3 and members of its coaching staff for the team 's bounty program			1
@entity1 commissioner @entity8 did not alter the lengths of the suspensions he had levied last month			1
but he left open the possibility that fine amounts could be reduced and a draft pick could be restored if the team and its coaching staff " embrace the opportunity " to help develop and implement player safety programs			0
the unprecedented punishment was handed down in march after an @entity1 investigation found the team had an " active bounty program " during the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 seasons			2
during this time , players were purportedly offered " bounty " payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game			1
the @entity1 found evidence that bounties were put on quarterbacks @entity31 of the @entity32 , @entity33 of the @entity34 , @entity35 of the @entity36 and @entity37 of the @entity38			0
the stiffest penalty that the @entity1 handed down -- an indefinite ban -- was given to @entity41 , the @entity3 defensive coordinator who , in this past offseason , moved over to take that same position with the @entity44			1
head coach @entity47 suspension for the entire 2012 - 2013 season will begin april 16 , the league said monday			1
general manager @entity49 was suspended without pay for that season 's first eight regular - season games , and assistant head coach @entity53 was suspended without pay for the first six regular - season games			0
their suspensions will begin at the end of the preseason , according to monday 's @entity1 statement			1
" at the conclusion of their suspensions , the commissioner will review the status of each of the three individuals to determine their eligibility for reinstatement , " the league said , referring to @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity53			1
the team was also fined $ 500,000 and ordered to forfeit its second - round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 , the @entity1 has said			0
the league added monday that it may consider " modifying the forfeiture " of the 2013 draft pick , assuming other conditions are met			0
@entity8 has said he 's also considering imposing penalties against players involved in the bounty program , but he has n't given a timetable and has insisted he 'll first consult with the @entity80 before doing so			0
in its ruling , the @entity1 singled out @entity47 -- who led the @entity3 to its first ever @entity83 victory in february 2010 , after a season in which the bounty program was in place -- by saying that violations for the bounty program " were compounded by the failure of coach @entity47 to supervise the players and coaches			1
" the league said that @entity47 did n't look further into the " pay - for - performance / bounty program " despite the @entity1 's inquiries about it in 2010 and 2012 , " falsely ( denied ) that the program existed " and encouraged " the false denials by instructing assistants to ' make sure our ducks are in a row			2
' " in public remarks , @entity47 has not admitted he lied to the @entity1 and insisted that no one was injured as a result of the bounty program			2
but he did say in late march , shortly after his suspension was announced , that he was " disappointed " in himself and regretted not being more involved in the team 's defense			2
" as the head coach , anything that happens within the framework of your team and your program you 're responsible for			0
and that 's a lesson i 've learned , " he said .			0

new : after the suspensions ' end , the commissioner will " review " the *cases*
new : @entity47 's suspension starts april 16 , the @entity123 's starts late this summer
they had appealed the suspensions handed out last month
the @entity1 says @entity3 players were offered extra money to hurt opposing players
