he won the @entity2 and is his country 's all - time leading goal scorer , but this is n't a story about a famous footballer rather a man who has almost single - handedly transformed the fortunes of handball in his homeland			1
@entity12 's @entity11 may not be a household name outside his sport , but his achievements on court put even those of his twinkle - toed compatriot @entity18 in the shade			1
with more than 375 international caps and a goal tally for @entity12 nearing 1,500 , @entity11 has been a colossus for both country and his various clubs in a career spanning almost two decades			1
during spells with sides in @entity12 ( @entity28 and @entity29 ) , @entity30 ( @entity32 and @entity33 ) and @entity34 ( @entity31 ) , @entity11 has won numerous club titles , including the @entity2 ( twice ) , the sport 's equivalent of football 's premier @entity39 club competition			1
but it is on the international stage where @entity11 has made his most enduring impact winning three @entity44 ( 2001 , 2009 , 2011 ) and @entity39 ( 2006 , 2010 , 2014 ) titles and olympic gold medals at the last two games in @entity48 and @entity49 in 2012			2
" the best memory in my career and for my sport was the @entity55 in @entity56 , because it was a title that changed the view of people in @entity12 about handball , " @entity11 told @entity1 's human to @entity51			1
" now it 's famous , but before we only saw football or basketball on tv			0
now , ( handball ) is one of the best sports in @entity12			2
" when a 20 - year - old @entity11 arrived on the international scene in 1997 , @entity12 was beginning to emerge as a major force in handball			1
a bronze medal at the @entity71 in 1992 was followed by the country 's first @entity73 gold medal three years later			0
the solid foundations were rapidly built on as @entity12 assembled a series of world - beating teams which has in turn helped fuel handball 's growing popularity among the @entity12 public			1
handball might not rival the participation levels of football or tennis -- the former has around two million licensed players in @entity12 , the latter just over one million -- but the sport has seen numbers rise steadily in recent years with participation up by almost a third -- @entity12 's @entity93 estimated there were just under half - a - million registered players in 2012			1
played on courts measuring 40 x 20 meters ( roughly a quarter larger in size than a basketball court ) , handball teams are made up of seven players -- one goalkeeper and six outfield -- with seven substitutes who can replace another player at any time during a game			2
a match lasts one hour ( played in two 30 - minute halves ) and games are often combative and fast - paced with lots of goals -- around one a minute on average			2
" if you want to play a contact sport with team spirit , you must play handball because i think it 's one of the most complete sports in the world , " @entity11 says			1
" it 's like rugby or @entity122 -- it 's very physical but very tactical too			0
you need to be fit and play collectively as a team			0
" with sudden changes in tempo and end - to - end action there is much to keep crowds entertained , but it is goals that gets handball crowds going			2
the jump shot , which sees a player leap before unleashing the ball at speeds up to 125 kph ( around 78 mph ) , is a spectacular climax to a long , drawn out tactical build - up and @entity11 is one of the game 's greatest exponents , says @entity34 handball journalist , @entity139			1
" he looks a little bit skinny compared to other players but he has the power in his arms and he can jump , " @entity139 explains			0
" he is famous for jumping over the defence players to score			0
" at six foot , six inches tall , @entity11 can leap higher than most , but in handball circles , much like basketball , he is no giant -- the sport attracts its fair share of seven - footers , with @entity158 's @entity157 currently one of the sport 's biggest attractions			1
while @entity11 's prolific goalscoring might grab the headlines , it is his intelligence and leadership that have made the 37 - year - old one of the top 10 players of all - time , says @entity139 , who has watched the @entity12 's career develop over the past 14 years			1
" usually you get injured when you get hit really hard but he was always clever enough to make moves that nobody expected			2
you know , he 's a very intelligent player in a very intelligent team , " he says			0
" when he comes in , in crucial matches like finals , everybody knows they can count on him -- he scores the goals or makes the crucial pass so that others can score			0
he is a leader but he 's also a team player			0
" it came as no surprise that @entity11 took over as national captain in 2009 and soon led @entity12 to their third ( his second ) world title beating perennial rivals @entity187 24 - 19 in the final in @entity189 in february that year			1
" this was a career highlight ... it was my first competition as captain -- for me it was the most important , " he says			0
@entity11 and @entity12 are currently on course to be crowned world champions for a fifth time at the @entity195 currently taking place in @entity197 -- @entity139 says they are " big favorites " at the biennial tournament			1
clinching a fourth world title would be deeply satisfying for @entity11 , but not as rewarding as attending a fifth consecutive @entity55 and the chance to equal another record in what would be his swansong in the sport			1
" his big dream is to go to @entity207 to play and win the @entity55 gold for a third time , " @entity139 says			2
" only @entity212 goalkeeper , @entity210 has won three olympic gold medals in 1988 , 1992 and 2000			0
" if he does travel to @entity215 -- @entity139 sees no reason why @entity12 would not pick him if he is fit -- then he has every chance of finishing his career on a golden high			2
but whatever happens in months ahead it looks like he 'll never be too far away from the court in the years to come			0
" i 'm thinking about becoming a coach			0
all that i have learned in my career i want to give to the young players so they can reach for titles with the clubs and the national team			0
for me it is normal to help players			0
handball is my sport , my passion and i want to give back			0
