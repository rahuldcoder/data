holding onto the rails of a cage , we descend lower and lower into the coal mine			2
it is pitch dark , hot and humid			0
every now and then a spray of water drizzles on us			0
the two - minute ride down seems much longer than that			0
once we reach the bottom of the shaft , we begin a 3.5 kilometer walk underground to the site where miners are excavating coal			2
for almost an hour , we trudge through the slush , the light from our safety helmets the only illumination underground			0
our protective clothes and faces quickly develop a black layer of coal dust			2
coal is a polluting fossil fuel , which currently powers more than 60 % of @entity27			1
the government produced 462 million tonnes of it last year and is targeting a billion tonnes by 2019			2
typically , the coal that burns in power plants across @entity27 is of poor quality , therefore more harmful			1
@entity27 is already the world 's third highest emitter of greenhouse gases			1
so why is @entity27 so hungry for coal ? coal is abundantly available in @entity27 , which has the world 's fifth largest reserves			1
that 's still not enough to feed the country 's hunger for the fuel			1
@entity44 industrialization and rising demands from the power sector are primarily leading to coal shortages , says @entity48 , an analyst at the @entity49 in @entity50			0
@entity27 resorts to imports to plug the gaps			1
for the current financial year , national demand for thermal coal to produce energy has been estimated at 551.6 million tonnes , authorities say			1
of it , at least 84.7 million tonnes is being met through imports , coal minister @entity57 told the @entity27 parliament in december			1
the state - run monopoly @entity63 ( @entity63 ) accounts for more than 80 % of the output			0
prime minister @entity66 's plans for future privatization of this crucial industry faced resistance recently , when @entity63 workers stopped work in january			0
the two - day strike -- the biggest of its kind in four decades -- not only severely limited the ability of the companies to meet their production quotas , but forced the government to go slow on reforms			0
around 300 million @entity27 still live in darkness , without access to electricity			1
that 's the entire population of the @entity84			1
coal remains an economical way to provide power , a cheaper fuel than several other sources			2
aware of international pressure to reduce its greenhouse gases , @entity27 is trying to ramp up alternative energy options			1
blessed with months of sunlight , it 's giving solar energy a big push			2
the current government has announced plans to produce 100 gigawatts of solar energy by 2022			0
compared with the three gigawatts @entity27 produced last year , it seems ambitious			2
but @entity100 , a renewable energy campaigner for @entity102 , believes it can be done			0
" by making the policy regulations more transparent and increasing investments on infrastructure this megafigure of @entity108 can definitely be pulled off , " he says			0
however , in order for it to happen , policy makers , regulators , solar companies , roof - top owners and off - grid users must cooperate			0
@entity27 is also moving ahead with a civil nuclear deal with the @entity84			1
progress was made when @entity84 president @entity117 visited @entity50 last month but it will take years for nuclear energy to power @entity27 in a significant way			1
it 's a balancing act for @entity66 , who has to manage international pressure regarding climate change on the one hand , and domestic pressure at home to illuminate lives and homes in @entity27			1
deep underground , miners work around the clock , seven days a week to power the country			0
it 's hoped in the future , newer , greener technology will be in place to spare the environment and share the load .			0

@entity27 has the world 's fifth largest coal reserves , but not enough to feed demand for fuel
amid pressure to reduce emissions , the country is trying to ramp up alternative energy options
around 300 million @entity27 still live in darkness -- *equivalent* to the entire @entity84 population
