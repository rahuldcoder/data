-- the @entity2 space shuttle program retired in 2011 , leaving @entity2 astronauts to hitchhike into orbit			2
but after three long years , @entity6 's successor is almost ready to make an entrance			1
@entity8 , the agency 's newest manned spaceship , is being prepared for its first mission in december			1
in future missions , it will journey into deep space -- to @entity14 and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before			1
@entity8 comes loaded with superlatives			0
it boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles			0
it will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket @entity6 has ever made			1
no astronauts will be aboard the december flight , which will test the spacecraft 's systems for future manned missions			2
final work on the spacecraft is under way at the @entity31 in @entity32			0
@entity8 came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module			0
" now that we 're getting so close to launch , the spacecraft completion work is visible every day , " @entity8 manager @entity38 said in a statement			0
a 3,600 - mile journey when complete , the @entity8 capsule will resemble a fencing foil , with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base			2
at the top will sit a launch abort system , with downward - facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction			0
the bottom portion , the service module , will perform various functions such as in - space propulsion and cargo storage			0
nestled between the two will be the crew module , capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery			0
attached to the service module will be a @entity66 rocket			0
for the first time since the space shuttle 's debut launch in 1981 , the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side , evoking the configuration of the famous @entity76 or @entity77 missions			0
come december , @entity8 will be wheeled onto the @entity79 launch pad and the countdown will begin			0
if all goes as planned , the engines will rumble and its rocket will thunder in an explosion of liquid oxygen , thrusting it toward the stars			0
the rocket will carry the modules 3,600 miles above @entity88 , or about 16 times higher than the average altitude of the @entity90			1
@entity8 " is built to take humans farther than they 've ever gone before , " @entity6 says			1
@entity8 will orbit our planet twice on its own during a 4Â½ - hour journey before screaming back into the @entity88 's atmosphere at nearly 20,000 miles per hour and splashing down in the @entity96			1
future missions @entity8 astronauts will enjoy access to unprecedented space travel technology			0
@entity6 says the spacecraft 's onboard computer system can process 480 million instructions per second , which is 400 times faster than the systems on the space shuttle and 4,000 times faster than those on the @entity76 flights of the 1960s and early 1970s			2
@entity8 also boasts the largest heat shield ever built , designed to withstand temperatures that would cause a nuclear reactor to melt down			2
" @entity8 's flight test will provide us with important data that will help us test out systems and further refine the design so we can safely send humans far into the solar system to uncover new scientific discoveries on future missions , " @entity38 said			2
after @entity8 splashes down , @entity6 will begin preparing the spacecraft for the future manned missions for which it was designed			1
" in the future , @entity8 will launch on @entity6 's new heavy - lift rocket , the space launch system , " the agency said			1
" more powerful than any rocket ever built , @entity127 will be capable of sending humans to deep space destinations such as an asteroid and eventually @entity14			1
" the first astronauts will travel into space aboard @entity8 in 2017			2
@entity6 hopes its @entity134 , a 25 - day flight around the moon 's dark side , will demonstrate @entity8 's reliability for deep space missions			1
@entity134 will send four astronauts farther than any human has been since the last @entity142 in 1972 , laying the groundwork for future endeavors			0
@entity6 hopes @entity8 will ring in a new era for crewed @entity2 space exploration , and @entity2 flags may someday fly on more space outposts than just the moon			1
@entity6 's bold plan : landing people on asteroids			1

@entity8 , @entity6 's newest manned spaceship , will have its first mission in december
a rocket will carry the @entity8 modules 3,600 miles above @entity88
it 's designed to journey into deep space -- to @entity14 and beyond -- in 2017
