-- republicans effectively gained control over @entity3 on tuesday			1
the @entity1 won a majority of seats in the @entity6 , thus overturning the gains @entity8 made in 2006 and 2008			1
in the @entity11 , where the procedural power of the minority has already given @entity1 the power to shape deliberations , the narrowed @entity10 ranks will further weaken the majority			1
in the weeks running up to the election , there were some commentators who concluded that the current situation would be the best outcome for president @entity22			1
pointing to the example of the 1994 midterms , which gave @entity25 control of @entity3 , they have argued that a bad outcome for @entity8 would ironically allow @entity22 to regain his standing			1
@entity22 could use republicans as a foil to attack extremism -- just as @entity32 did with speaker @entity33 in 1995 and 1996 -- and he would have political cover and incentives to move closer toward the center , where voters would like him more			1
gov. @entity39 of @entity40 said , " i do see a similarity to the @entity32 experience			1
the divided government result , if it happens , is good for the president , because he now has some potential enemies but he also has some potential partners to get things done where he did n't have them before			0
" yet this analogy rests on a selective memory of what happened after 1994 , which is particularly surprising from someone who worked in the administration			1
the period that followed those midterms was among the most contentious in recent @entity59 politics			0
republicans conducted a series of investigations into the @entity32 administration , which consumed an enormous amount of time and political energy from the @entity67			1
the investigations culminated in @entity32 's impeachment proceedings			1
the partisan battles took their toll			0
while @entity72 and his minions were preparing to attack the @entity59 , @entity71 was engaged in bitter partisan wars over @entity32 's relationship with an intern			1
as the historian @entity78 recounted , the partisanship also drowned a secret effort by @entity80 and @entity32 to reach a bipartisan pact on @entity83 reform			1
the process damaged both parties , not just @entity8			0
republicans were left without their own leaders			0
@entity80 essentially was forced to resigned because the @entity88 lost confidence in his leadership			0
his slated successor , @entity94 's @entity92 , had to resign because of personal problems			0
the 2000 election revealed how divided the parties had become			0
democrats and @entity1 squared off in the courts after questions about the vote in @entity102 , making the electoral process itself fair game in the scandal wars taking place between the parties			1
divided government will make a fragile legislative process even more difficult to maneuver			0
although political scientists have shown how important legislation has passed in periods of divided government , it is unclear how this model holds up in recent times			2
there was not much legislative progress on big issues such as @entity83 or health care reform in the second half of the 1990s			0
these years were not some high point in policymaking			0
in fact , it was just the opposite			0
most key issues were pushed aside			0
the situation will only be worse today			0
the intensified partisan polarization that exists in today 's never - ending campaign cycle makes it even more difficult for the parties to reach deals on major issues			0
with the exodus of moderate @entity8 as a result of @entity88 victories , the parties in @entity3 will move farther apart			1
the 24 - hour polarized media will fuel the conflict and facilitate scandal warfare			0
for those who liked what they saw in the second half of the 1990s : @entity22 will have more trouble doing what @entity32 did politically when he painted @entity1 as right of center			1
after all , the nation does n't have divided government , it has a divided @entity3			2
so if @entity22 attacks the @entity3 for failing to produce results , voters will not only turn to see the face of speaker @entity154 but they also will see whoever ends up as leader of the @entity8			1
this makes the argument hard to sell			0
additionally , there is no reason to believe that either president @entity22 or congressional @entity1 will have much incentive to enter a grand bargain such as welfare reform in 1996			1
if there was ever a time that @entity1 had reason to compromise it was after their disastrous showing in the election of 2008			2
yet @entity1 did not compromise			2
now , with 2012 over the horizon , the @entity1 will have more incentives to oppose the president			2
indeed , sen. @entity171 , leader of the @entity25 , recently said : " the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president @entity22 to be a one - term president			2
" at the same time , @entity22 faces a significant risk if he tries to appease republicans in @entity32 - like fashion			1
after all , many liberals are already frustrated with the kinds of compromises @entity22 has made			2
going too far -- for example , declaring that the era of big government is over -- could trigger a challenge to the president in the @entity10 primaries			0
we should hope that the @entity59 is not about to live through a repeat performance of what occurred after 1994			2
the nation faces too many pressing economic and foreign policy problems to have that happen again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2

@entity196 says @entity1 gained control of @entity3 and some predict that will help @entity22
they say when @entity32 faced this in 1994 , it gave political cover to press agenda , he says
but what really happened , he says , was years of *gridlock* , investigations , division
@entity194 : we should hope @entity22 does not face this , as too many issues need real attention
