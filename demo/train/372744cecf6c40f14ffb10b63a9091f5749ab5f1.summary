@entity0 -- on a steamy @entity4 mid-summer morning , two girls ' teams battle in the finals of the the @entity6			1
competition is fierce between the teams from opposite corners of the @entity10			1
the @entity11 from @entity12 and the @entity14 team from @entity4 both earned the right to participate in this semi-final game during the annual competition that draws teams from the @entity10 and other countries			1
this game and the tournament are an outgrowth of an @entity10 trend -- the number of children playing soccer in the @entity10 has grown dramatically , especially among young girls who idolized the @entity10 women 's soccer teams competing in the @entity29			1
just three decades ago , the @entity10 @entity31 organization counted its membership at 100,000			1
today , as municipal parks are filled with millions of young soccer players , the organization counts more than 3 million young players , according to its website			1
the @entity6 has taken place for the past 13 years at @entity39 's @entity38 at @entity40			2
the complex 's numbers reflect a growth of women participating in sports in general			0
" sixty percent of athletes that participate at the @entity38 of approximately 300,000 athletes are women , " says @entity47 , business director of the complex			0
the sports park holds sporting competitions year round for baseball , football , soccer , basketball , along with track and field			0
@entity61 -- mom , soccer coach and former soccer player -- loves the sport intimately			0
in fact , she wishes she could still play , but the years can get in the way			0
" i 've seen women 's soccer go from a small sport to a huge sport , i think it 's the fastest growing sport because the other ones have been around for a long time , " said @entity61 , whose daughter plays on the @entity14 team			1
this soccer mom believes every time the @entity10 women 's soccer team competes in high - profile competitions like the @entity29 , it exposes more girls and young women to the game			1
" people start watching not that they 're interested in soccer , but they like to see @entity10 win , " says @entity61			1
but once they watch , the game catches on			0
the @entity10 women 's soccer team won the 1999 @entity29 , grabbing the attention of girls and women throughout the @entity10 when @entity92 -- the @entity10 law that banned discrimination based on sex in education and other activities for schools that received federal funding -- became law in 1972 , women 's participation in sports exploded			1
and in 1972 , two colleges offered scholarships for women 's soccer			0
today , dozens of college have programs and offer scholarships , says @entity61			2
@entity106 , coach of the @entity11 , says , " i have one daughter and it 's pretty cool that she can do all the same things that i could do as a boy -- but i do n't think it was there for my sister			0
" @entity106 says the level of women 's soccer continues to improve as does the level of coaching			0
women typically coached girls ' teams in the past but today men or women with more experience are teaching the game			1
" if you 're practicing right and playing hard and if you believe you 're as good as every boy -- or better -- than you should go out there and prove it to me , " says coach @entity106 to his squad of 12 - to - 14 - year - old girls			2
" and they usually do , " said @entity106 whose girls often beat boys ' teams in mixed matches			2
the @entity6 sports complex director says he continues to see soccer grow at single digits growth , as do other sports			0
" you 're seeing soccer more because it 's played at a younger age ; girls stay with that sport longer , " says @entity47			2
" where it 's growing internationally , it will fuel the @entity10 ' growth , " he added			1
even teenager @entity148 with the @entity149 's has seen soccer for women change			0
" there used to be no soccer at all but it 's becoming so global and so much fun to watch -- that 's it 's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger , " she says			0
the @entity158 team beat @entity11 2 - 1 to move on to the final , only to loose to @entity161 's @entity160 0 - 3			2
despite his daughter 's team 's loss , soccer dad @entity162 kept a positive attitude following the game			0
" i think you are going to see a boost to soccer to both men and women , " he predicts			0
" i think soccer is going to take off in the @entity10 it 's about time ! "			1

three decades ago , the @entity10 @entity31 organization had 100,000 members
