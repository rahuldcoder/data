ireport.com : watch @entity1 talk about losing weight reaching this 10 - pound milestone , from 190 to 180 pounds , makes her feel as if it will be easier to lose more weight , she said			1

@entity1 felt frustrated earlier this month because her progress felt slow , losing a pound a week			2
read about her weight loss journey often , the initial weight loss will seem the easiest , and then the loss slows somewhat over time , said @entity53 , dietician for the @entity56 @entity55 team and owner of @entity58 in @entity59 , @entity60			1
exercise is key in speeding things up when you 've reached a plateau , she said			0

@entity53 usually recommends losing about 2 pounds a week , or about 5 to 8 pounds a month			2
at that rate , someone like @entity1 could lose 50 pounds in six months , she said			2
a pace faster than that -- such as 10 pounds per month -- would be hard to keep up , @entity53 said			1
people with on weight - loss journeys should have encouragement from friends , family or people in support groups or online communities , she said			2
@entity1 certainly has people supporting her in the virtual world : a video she posted a few weeks ago after she 'd lost 4 pounds had more than a dozen motivational comments from others on @entity15			1
