-- all eyes at the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , will be on @entity5 and @entity6 , two men who are barely on speaking terms			0
undoubtedly there will be drama			0
@entity5 brought his pet @entity11 , @entity13 , to his first meeting with @entity16 chancellor @entity15 , who has a well - known fear of dogs , to intimidate her			2
given @entity5 's track record , one could be forgiven for thinking that @entity20 might make an appearance in the @entity4 delegation			0
the true cost of the @entity25 - @entity4 dispute will only become apparent in a few months			0
as the leaders focus on @entity30 , the purpose of the summit -- managing the global economy -- will get short shrift			1
as concern grows about economic troubles in emerging economies such as @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , we are unlikely to see a coordinated response from @entity3			0
official agenda items such as energy subsidies and food security will be completely overshadowed			0
the @entity45 leaders ' summit was created in 2008 after the fall of @entity47 as the world economy stood on the brink of collapse			1
the @entity52 's leaders recognized they could not fix the global economy by themselves in the old @entity54 club			1
emerging economies such as @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity56 and @entity57 had to be brought into the mix and could no longer be treated as second - class citizens			0
the @entity45 's great contribution to world affairs was its success in managing the global financial crisis and restoring stability to the financial system			1
the @entity67 summit in 2008 and the @entity69 summit in 2009 did much to avert a new great depression			1
unprecedented cooperation between the world 's largest economies provided liquidity that limited the contagion of the banking crisis , kept markets open and prevented countries from resorting to protectionism , and provided a stimulus that cushioned the drop in growth			1
in the years since , it has become fashionable to say that the @entity45 failed to follow up on its initial success			1
there is some truth to that			0
member states have been unable to agree on a common fiscal policy -- the @entity25 and several emerging powers favored more stimulus , while @entity16 and the @entity92 led a coalition for austerity			0
much still needs to be done to fix international finance , which remains crisis - prone			2
and the @entity45 has been unable to assist in managing the euro crisis			1
once it stepped back from the edge of the precipice , each government began fighting from its own corner			0
now , as emerging economies slow down and developed economies show new signs of growth , some may ask whether the @entity45 still has a role to play			2
is it just another talking shop ? this view is understandable but wrongheaded			0
it could do better , but the @entity45 still matters for the global economy			1
in a globalized world , no country can pursue a unilateral international economic policy			2
instability in a major economy will inevitably destabilize all other economies			0
we ca n't go back to the @entity54 , which would leave out the world 's second ( @entity36 ) , seventh ( @entity38 ) and 10th ( @entity37 ) largest economies			1
governments will disagree on the best way to achieve growth , on the right level of regulation , on currency manipulation and much else			0
but all of these divisions would grow and threaten economic stability if leaders did not formally meet to discuss them			0
even if progress is slow , we live with the ever - present risk of a new economic crisis			1
if one were to occur , a functioning @entity45 is indispensable			2
the real problem with the @entity3 summit , which contrary to expectations was relatively well - organized by @entity4 , is that the @entity45 's global economy agenda has being taken over by the @entity30 crisis			1
it is not surprising , but there is a real cost			0
the world still needs an effective steering committee for the global economy			1
if there were the remotest possibility of @entity45 agreement on @entity30 , it might be worth it , but there is n't			1
it will be up to @entity155 , which hosts the next summit in 2014 , to get the @entity45 back on track			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : @entity30 likely to overshadow @entity45 's purpose : managing global economy
he says @entity45 created in 2008 to respond to economic crisis and it was able to avert *disaster*
@entity45 remains *key* to *staving* off global economic crises , @entity160 says
@entity160 : meeting likely wo n't do much to solve @entity30 conflict , but world still needs @entity45
