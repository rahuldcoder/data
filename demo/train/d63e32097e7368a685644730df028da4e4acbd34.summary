the @entity29 , insisting it is now fulfilling more of a support role in the coalition , shifted in that direction as @entity39 took sole command of air operations in @entity1			1
the ferocity of this month 's fighting and @entity8 's advantage in firepower was clearly evident in @entity46 , which has seen snipers , significant casualties and destruction			1
a witness told @entity2 thursday there " is utter madness " and @entity8 's men are going door - to - door evicting and terrorizing people			2

but in the past three days , opposition fighters have been pushed back eastward			0
@entity2 's @entity129 , reporting thursday from near @entity123 , said the rebels , armed with light mortars and machine guns , have displayed no strategy in their running battles with loyalist troops			2
@entity86 reiterated the @entity138 administration 's promise that no @entity29 ground forces will be used in @entity1 , telling committee members that the rebels had indicated they did n't want such an intervention			1

at one recent media briefing , he kept his head down as he read a statement and left early			0
@entity93 foreign secretary @entity231 said @entity222 had not been offered any immunity			0
