thousands of protesters surrounded @entity2 's @entity1 on friday seeking the removal of @entity5 's embattled caretaker government amid soaring political tensions following the ouster of former prime minister @entity8			1
the @entity9 , which has been protesting the government since november , is pushing to replace the caretaker administration with an unelected interim government			1
protest leader @entity13 told those gathered : " we will sleep here tonight , we will eat here			0
" the @entity9 has been seeking to rid @entity5 politics of the alleged influence of former prime minister @entity19			1
@entity19 is @entity8 's brother and a telecommunications tycoon who was overthrown in a 2006 military coup			1
he has since lived in self - imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction			0
" if the speaker is a slave of @entity19 , there will be one treatment ; if not , there will be another treatment for them , " @entity13 said			0
some 20,000 protesters massed in the capital and split into groups			2
about 4,000 or 5,000 gathered outside @entity1			0
that is the former prime minister 's residence , but @entity8 has already vacated it			1
lt. gen. @entity35 , security adviser to the government , told @entity37 the @entity9 had mobilized supporters from the countryside to join the protests in the capital			2
he said smaller groups also gathered at @entity2 television stations and other locations around the city			0
" we are monitoring ( the situation ) closely , " he said , adding that 60,000 security forces were on standby			2
at the @entity53 , command center of the temporary security task force , the center for the @entity50 , police used tear gas and water cannon on protesters who attempted to enter the complex , said @entity35			2
at @entity1 , stalls were erected and free food and drinks handed out to the protesters			2
the protest was peaceful , with music and dancing			0
a moment of silence was held for those killed in the country 's longstanding political conflict			2
' judicial coup ' ? the rally comes at the end of a week of political chaos in @entity5 , which saw @entity8 and nine cabinet ministers removed from office by a top court on wednesday in what her supporters saw as a " judicial coup			1
" her supporters plan their own mass rally on saturday			2
members of the @entity83 unanimously indicted @entity8 , 46 , on thursday for dereliction of duty over her government 's controversial rice subsidy scheme , committee member @entity81 told reporters in @entity2			1
the @entity88 will now vote on whether to impeach her			0
asked how that could impact her since she 's already out as prime minister , @entity81 said the case still needed to be reviewed by the @entity88 and that she could be banned from political office for five years , if impeached			2
analysts had speculated the commission might also indict @entity8 's replacement as caretaker , the deputy prime minister and commerce minister @entity98 , creating a political vacuum			1
but @entity81 did not announce any measures against the new head of government			2
an committee also considered whether to file criminal charges against @entity8 , but had not yet found sufficient evidence for that , he said			1
the rice subsidy program , introduced in 2011 , pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop , but has run into financial problems			0
critics say it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters , hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it ca n't sell without losing money			2
@entity8 has previously said she was only in charge of developing policy around the scheme , not its day - to - day implementation , accusing the commission of unfair treatment			1

" the @entity141 polarization is likely to deepen and intensify , " said @entity138 , political scientist at @entity139			2
" we are now looking at a political freefall			2
... much worse looks likely in the near term , before we can hope for improved circumstances in the longer term			0
" officials confirmed thursday a grenade had been thrown at the house of one of the @entity152 judges whose ruling forced @entity8 from office			1
@entity35 told @entity37 nobody was hurt in the early morning attack on the home of the judge , @entity158			0
" it landed on his garage , " he said			0
the court removed @entity8 , who was elected in 2011 and had been serving as caretaker prime minister until elections could be held , after finding her guilty of violating the country 's constitution for reassigning a senior security official			1
the official was replaced by the then national police chief , whose role in turn was given to @entity172 , a relative of @entity8			1
@entity173 is the brother of @entity19 's ex-wife			0
' polarization to intensify ' analyst @entity177 , director at @entity178 , a @entity2 - based risk assessment firm , said the court 's removal of an elected prime minister on what he described as " fairly weak " grounds was viewed by the government 's supporters as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach			2
" they consider it a way to usurp democratic elections , " he said			0
@entity8 is the third @entity19 - linked prime minister to be dismissed by the @entity152 , which also dissolved @entity19 's @entity194 political party in 2007 , raising suspicions among government supporters that the institution was biased against them			1
@entity138 said the appointment of @entity98 , seen as closely affiliated to @entity8 and her brother , was poor judgment , especially when another deputy prime minister , @entity202 , would have been a more acceptable compromise candidate			1
" he lacks the stature and networks to see through an interim caretaker administration , " he said			0
" nevertheless , no matter who comes in as the new caretaker , the tensions will mount			1
" widening divide @entity5 's widening political divide pits anti-government , predominantly urban " yellow shirt " protesters against the pro-government , mainly rural and working class " red shirts			1
" the anti-government protesters , drawn mainly from @entity2 's middle class , royalist establishment , allege that @entity8 is her brother 's puppet and seek to rid @entity5 politics of her family 's influence			1
led by the @entity9 , they began their protests in november , outraged by her government 's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for the return of @entity19 to the political fray in earnest			1
@entity234 was then dissolved in december ahead of a snap february general election that was disrupted by anti-government protesters , and subsequently ruled invalid by the @entity152			1
the protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections , which the opposition @entity241 has boycotted , arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held			1
" they claim the @entity19 clan as they call ( it ) is corrupt and has dominated the country 's politics , and the only way forward is to remove the @entity19 influence from politics and not have elections , " said @entity177			0
@entity13 , a former deputy prime minister for the @entity241 , has instead called for power to be transferred to an unelected " people 's council			0
" but @entity177 said the opposition 's real motivation for avoiding elections was clear			0
" the @entity241 say ' no , we ca n't have elections , ' because they know they will lose those elections			0
" in contrast , the red shirt supporters of @entity8 and her brother , many of whom hail from the north and northeast of the country , accuse the court of bias against their side			1
@entity9 spokesman @entity276 told @entity37 his movement did not recognize the legitimacy of the caretaker government			1
" currently there is no government to govern this country , so we must find a way to appoint a new government			0
" ' breaking point ' meanwhile , the red shirts are planning their own rally in @entity2 saturday to protest what @entity177 said they saw as " a judicial coup			0
" in the wake of the court 's ruling wednesday , supporters at the red shirts ' @entity2 headquarters were defiant			0
" this is the breaking point now , everything is leading up to the breaking point , " @entity297 , a @entity2 piano teacher and @entity8 supporter told @entity37			1
" i would say @entity8 has died ( in ) her duty for democracy			1
" @entity303 , a red shirt leader urged supporters to join saturday 's rally			0
" we wo n't give up until we win			0
" elections are scheduled for july 20 , but @entity138 said he believed it was " unlikely " that a vote would proceed in the wake of recent developments			0
" the @entity9 appears intent on pressing on for an appointment government of its preference , which can only galvanize red shirt protests , " he said			0
" a showdown is looming			0
