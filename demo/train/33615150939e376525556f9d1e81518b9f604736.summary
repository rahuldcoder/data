-- when @entity3 linebacker @entity2 spoke out in august in favor of a @entity6 ballot initiative that would legalize gay marriage , state delegate @entity1 wrote a letter to @entity3 owner , @entity9 saying that many football fans are " opposed to such a view " and suggesting that @entity9 " inhibit such expressions " from his employee			0
@entity2 , one of the first pro athletes to publicly support gay marriage , saw @entity1 ' efforts to stifle him as a violation of his first amendment rights			1
on september 7 , @entity20 punter @entity19 's penned a scathing response to @entity1 , stating , among other things : " i can assure you that gay people getting married will have zero effect on your life			1
they wo n't come into your house and steal your children			0
they wo n't magically turn you into a lustful c * * kmonster			0
" when football , same - sex marriage and politics collide in an interview with @entity0 's @entity37 , @entity19 attributed the " lustful c * * kmonster " bit to the fact that he developed a talent for coming up with attention - grabbing message board postings after growing up playing a lot of online video games			1
" if you ca n't make a point that sticks in someone 's mind , " @entity19 explained , " most people probably wo n't really listen to you			1
so i developed a writing style that combined logical presentation of facts with hopefully some pretty hilarious insults			0
" colorful language aside , @entity19 was trying to make a serious point			1
he hoped that calling @entity1 out would spark a genuine conversation about the issues highlighted in the letter			0
professional athletes , on the whole , are n't as outspoken as @entity19 when it comes to gay marriage and other hot - button issues			1
for the most part , they keep low profiles because they do n't want to upset fans , risk endorsement deals or disappoint their coaches			0
@entity68 , the first black man to play in the majors since the 1800s , desegregated @entity71 in 1947 when he joined the @entity72			2
@entity68 let his talent speak for itself , playing in six @entity74 with the @entity72 , until his playing career was over and he became an advocate for civil rights			1
recognized as a hero of the era , @entity68 is the only player ever to have his jersey number -- 42 -- retired across the board by every @entity71 team			2
in 1966 , when he became eligible for the draft during the @entity85 , boxer @entity83 declared himself a conscientious objector			2
that same year , the heavyweight champion also delivered the " @entity88 is @entity93 " speech to 4,000 students at @entity91 upon being invited to speak by the campus protest group @entity92			0
for refusing to enlist , @entity83 was arrested , fined and stripped of his title , and for more than three years he could not box in any state in the @entity97 in 1967 , @entity83 was convicted of violating @entity97 @entity99 laws by refusing to be drafted			2
as public opposition to the war grew , @entity83 delivered speeches across the country , at one point asking , " why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in @entity110 while so - called negro people in @entity112 are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights ? " @entity83 's conviction was overturned by the @entity116 in 1971			1
pro athletes ignore backlash , show true political colors the outspoken @entity120 , however , were few and far between			1
in 1990 , for example , @entity121 declined to endorse @entity125 @entity124 candidate @entity123 , saying " republicans buy shoes , too			0
" times have changed , and this past summer , @entity121 helped president @entity130 's re-election campaign net $ 3 million at a $ 20,000 - a - plate fundraising dinner			0
while the majority of professional athletes today still adopt a laissez - faire attitude toward taking a stand on controversial issues , the tide is slowly turning			2
@entity139 linebacker @entity138 , a longtime advocate for @entity141 player safety , publicly accused commissioner @entity142 this month of abusing his power by not being more vigilant about health and safety issues concerning players			2
" he failed to acknowledge a link between concussions ( and ) post-career brain disease , " @entity138 said in a statement , " pushed for an 18 - game regular season , committed to a full season of thursday night games , has continually challenged players ' rights to file workers ' compensation claims for on - the - job injuries , and he employed incompetent replacement officials for the start of the 2012 season			0
his actions or lack thereof are , by the league 's own definition , ' conduct detrimental			0
' " @entity142 maintained that @entity138 , a former @entity166 team captain , should have done more to stop players from participating in a team bounty program			0
that scandal involved several @entity166 defensive players who were discovered to have secretly managed a pool of money from which bonuses were awarded to players who injured opponents between 2009 and 2011			0
@entity142 suspended @entity138 for three games but reduced that suspension to one , acknowledging that @entity138 did not participate in @entity178			0
in @entity182 , as residents prepare to vote on an amendment to ban gay marriage , @entity19 remains outspoken			1
" it would be great if @entity182 could show @entity97 that this state treats people the right way and knows that gay people contribute just as much to society as straight people , " @entity19 said			1
although he himself is not a homosexual , @entity19 posed for the november cover of @entity193			2
he noted that historically -- though most sports figures are reluctant to do so -- it has often been professional athletes who have brought about awareness of issues like gay marriage and civil rights			1
" when sports gets on board with a civil issue , then that issue is rapidly resolved in the next , you know , 10 , 15 years , " he said			0
" sports speaks to a large segment of the population , and when kids look at athletes as role models , they say , ' ok , hey , these guys are saying it 's ok if you 're gay , it 's ok to have same - sex marriage			1
' " @entity19 maintains that , despite his outspokenness , he has no plans to become a politician after his playing days are over			2
he hopes that one day , it wo n't be necessary for him to defend the issue of gay marriage			0
" it should n't be news when someone speaks out for equality , " he said			1
" it should be news when someone speaks out against equality			1

@entity20 punter @entity19 is an advocate for gay rights
pro athletes , however , usually do n't take a strong stance on the issues
outspoken sports stars like @entity19 , @entity83 and @entity68 are rare
