@entity1 president @entity0 and @entity3 president @entity2 committed themselves to the quest for peace sunday during a meeting of key figures in the @entity10 peace process			1
but unlike previous attempts to achieve a resolution to the region 's turmoil through traditional means , there would be no negotiating nor any political talks at sunday 's summit			0
this appeal would be made to a higher calling : @entity0 and @entity2 prayed for peace together sunday at the @entity24 home of @entity25			1
the meeting comes two weeks after the @entity25 invited the two leaders to do so during his visit to the @entity29			1
" in this , the birthplace of the @entity35 " the @entity25 said in @entity31 's @entity30 following a may 25 @entity32 , " i wish to invite you , president @entity0 , together with president @entity2 , to join me in heartfelt prayer to @entity40 for the gift of peace			1
" sunday 's meeting was a first for the @entity44 , which had never hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict			0
however pious the agenda , the day was n't totally free of political subtext			0
after prayers read in @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 by figures from different religions , each leader offered his own invocation			0
" without peace , we are not complete			0
we have yet to achieve this mission of humanity , " @entity2 said			2
" even when peace seems distant , we must pursue it to bring it closer			2
" " we ask you , @entity68 , for peace in the @entity29 , @entity70 and @entity71 , " said @entity0 , according to a @entity66 translator			1
" together with its people , we call on you to make @entity70 and @entity71 , in particular , a secure land for all believers , a place of prayer and worship			1
" the @entity25 said the meeting is the response to people who want to live as brothers and sisters and not as enemies			1
" i hope that this meeting will be a journey toward what joins us , to overcome what divides us , " @entity25 said			2
the groundbreaking meeting -- which was the result of the @entity25 offering an olive branch two weeks ago -- concluded with the two men exchanging kisses on the cheek before they broke ground themselves for the planting of an olive tree			2
only time will tell if today 's prayers will go answered			0
" the metric that @entity25 would be using to measure the success of this event is much longer term			0
i do n't think anyone is expecting an immediate result , " said @entity66 senior @entity44 analyst @entity109 " now that said , you could also argue that the success of tonight could be measured by the simple fact that it happened			0
