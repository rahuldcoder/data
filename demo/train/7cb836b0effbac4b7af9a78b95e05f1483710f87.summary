world no. 3 @entity26 , searching for his first triumph in one of golf 's four majors in front of his home fans , says the ban was unrealistic in the modern age			1
" we live in times when the mobile phone is a key tool in business affairs so i think we might deter people from attending if there is a ban , " the 39 - year - old , who has over 450,000 followers on @entity32 , said in quotes released to @entity0 ahead of the 141st @entity9			1
" obviously you do n't want them ringing when you are about to take a shot , but in general golf followers tend to be mindful of a player 's needs			2
" @entity48 's @entity47 has also backed the @entity5 's decision , but warned that fans will need to use their phones responsibly			1
" cell phones or smart phones are a part of life these days , " said the world @entity51 ahead of the tournament at the @entity54 and @entity55 on @entity57 's west coast			1
" i do n't have a problem with it			0
i just hope all spectators at the @entity9 are considerate towards the players and put them on silent			1
" @entity66 & a head of communications @entity68 explained how mobile phone use will only be allowed in specific zones , and that the move is part of the @entity9 welcoming new technology			1
" it 's absolutely something we 're embracing , " @entity68 told @entity0			0
" we 're not naÃ ¯ ve or blind to the potential issues it could cause or the challenges which come with this policy			0
" but we 're excited our spectators will have access to more information than they 've ever had on a golf course before			0
that can only heighten the experience of the open championship			0
" the subject of mobile phone use during golf tournaments was raised after both four - time major winner @entity93 and 2012 @entity94 champion @entity94 complained of spectators taking pictures during june 's @entity97			2
despite the complaints from high - profile players , @entity99 commissioner @entity98 outlined how no ban on phones at events would be implemented			2
@entity68 is hoping new technology designed for the @entity9 , which was won by @entity107 's @entity106 in 2011 , will enhance the spectator experience			2
" new for this year we have an ipad application , " added @entity68			0
" allowing our spectators to have handheld devices on the golf course allows them to have up - to - the - minute scores			0
" there is a new course guide we have for this year which uses gps technology to show spectators and people who are n't at the event exactly where different groups are on the golf course			2
" " we 're also going to have live coverage available in the @entity123 through our apps , which is an exciting development			0
