the @entity10 has told @entity2 that it will not issue a visa to @entity6 because of his ties to the 1979 takeover of the @entity16 in @entity4 , the @entity12 said			1
but @entity2 's deputy foreign minister @entity17 told reporters in @entity4 that @entity6 remained @entity2 's choice and that it is following up on the issue through diplomatic channels , according to state broadcaster @entity22			1
@entity2 lawmaker @entity24 told state news agency @entity25 that the @entity10 was obliged to honor its responsibility to issue visas in its role as host for the @entity9 headquarters in @entity31			1
