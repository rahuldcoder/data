-- the @entity1 is among the areas of the @entity3 with the highest concentration of cases of @entity6 and @entity7 , according to a new online tool called the @entity9			1
in this map of @entity7 prevalence rates in the @entity1 , red represents the highest ( 0.593 percent or greater )			1
@entity7 experts in the region say that access to health care , especially when it comes to screening , is a major problem in rural communities			1
in the @entity1 , people with @entity6 tend to get tested late , after they have become sick , partly because of stigma , said @entity23 , executive director of @entity24 in @entity25			2
" if you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card , the @entity26 is the worst , " she said			2
with little or no public transportation , people in non-metropolitan areas are at a disadvantage when they need to see a particular kind of doctor , experts say			0
there is also a shortage of doctors who deal with @entity6 in the region , @entity23 said			2
these problems also resonate with @entity43 's rural communities , which represent 39 percent of the hiv / aids burden in the state , said @entity46 , director of the @entity47 at the @entity43 @entity48			0
the remaining 61 percent of people living with @entity6 or @entity7 are in the metro @entity50 area			1
" in some districts , for example , there may be 10 counties within that health district but only one infectious disease doctor that people can access for care and services , " he said			0
it is also difficult to get @entity6 education to people in rural areas , he said			2
of the 29 states reporting county - level data for the @entity9 , @entity43 had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of @entity6 and @entity7 prevalence			1
although this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment , @entity43 ranked fifth in reporting of new @entity7 cases in 2007 , behind @entity76 ( fourth ) , @entity77 ( third ) , @entity78 ( second ) and @entity79 ( first ) , according to the @entity80			2
the @entity82 also has a heavy burden of hiv / aids cases nationally , atlas collaborators said			0
other states with high numbers of counties with high @entity6 prevalence included @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity89			2
the atlas , the first of its kind to map out @entity6 and @entity7 at the level of counties , launched in time for saturday 's @entity95			1
the @entity96 is encouraging everyone age 13 to 64 to get tested for @entity6 as part of routine health care			1
" not knowing one 's hiv status endangers one 's health and the health of one 's sexual partners			0
by getting tested for the virus and learning one 's hiv status soon after infection , treatment can begin early , substantially delaying the development of @entity6 - related illness and prolonging life , " said dr. @entity107 , director of the @entity108 at the @entity96			1
the @entity115 allows users to explore the prevalence of @entity6 and @entity7 in any region of the @entity3			1
the map , a project of the @entity121 , encompasses all 50 states , the @entity123 , @entity124 and the @entity125			0
the more red a region appears , the greater the prevalence , which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time			0
users can look at rates of disease by gender , race / ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available			0
the map also has different settings for @entity6 and @entity7 , the more severe illness caused by the hiv virus			1
they can also zoom into counties and , for @entity151 only , zip codes			0
about 33 million people have hiv / aids worldwide as of 2007 , according to the @entity154			0
the @entity80 estimates that 1.1 million @entity3 have @entity6 and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the @entity3 in 2006			1
nearly 75 percent of hiv / aids diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males			0
people who worked on the atlas project were surprised at how concentrated @entity6 and @entity7 are in certain @entity3 counties			1
" being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the @entity6 epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the @entity3 , " said @entity163 , associate professor of epidemiology at @entity165 , who collaborated on the atlas			1
the atlas also reflects the disproportionate number of african - americans who have @entity6 and @entity7			1
" you can see at the level of the national map that there 's so much variation in the @entity3 about which groups have been impacted , " @entity163 said			2
demographics and county - level data are not available for some states , or parts of some states , because of the way these places report data by region , researchers said			2
these areas appear as gray when users zoom in			0
some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low			0
the atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006 , the most recent available			1
collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available			0
the atlas , which launched monday morning , had about 100,000 visitors by tuesday afternoon , and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time , said @entity203 , executive director of the atlas project			0
