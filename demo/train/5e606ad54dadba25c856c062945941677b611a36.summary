-- imagine a future in which planes run on a mixture of batteries , body heat and cow manure			1
or perhaps noise pollution would cease to exist ( thanks to a shape - shifting engine , that is )			1
luggage could arrive at the baggage carousel quicker , because it would float on and off aircraft like pucks on an air hockey table			1
these sci - fi - sounding concepts have been drafted by a handful of engineering students at the behest of @entity19 , who has partnered with @entity21 to sponsor the third consecutive @entity22			1
according to @entity24 , @entity19 ' senior manager for research and technology , the goal is to engage tomorrow 's innovators , and perhaps nudge their eco-conscience in the process			1
" we 're trying to encourage the next generation of leaders to think about ways in which the aviation industry could be made more eco-efficient , and to be sympathetic to its environmental impact , " he says			2
the competition is in keeping with the company 's goal of halving co2 emissions by 2050 , and many of the solutions could mean the future of flight is zero - emission			1
" even if you replaced ( jet fuel ) with liquid natural gas , you could cut co2 emissions 20 % , " says @entity44 , a finalist in the competition			1

he envisions bio-lng -- a combo of bio-methane ( a by - product of organic composed waste ) and liquid natural gas -- replacing traditional jet fuel			1
overall , says @entity44 , the blend could reduce co2 emissions by 97 %			1
@entity66 has presented another novel energy - saving technology involving converting passengers ' body heat into electrical voltage			1
@entity71 , the team leader , envisions cabin seats upholstered with a thermoelectric fabric that can convert a person 's energy into 100 nanowatts of voltage			0
alas , that amounts to about one - millionth of what your @entity78 needs to stay on standby			2
still , @entity71 maintains that it does ultimately add up			0
" it 's a small amount , but imagine this collected from 550 seats throughout 10 hours of flight			0
a plane has a lifespan of a few hundred flights -- over time that 's a big reduction , " he says			0

" currently , the difficulty is that these devices do weigh something , and weight has a direct impact on fuel			0
the trade - off does n't work just yet , but there is potential there in the future			2
" @entity108 , co-founder and pilot of @entity110 , the solar powered currently flying across the @entity112 , believes that wild ideas are what inspires innovation			2
" the world of aviation loves pioneers , because they 're responsible for its existence , " says @entity108			0
" of course , they do n't believe that what we 're doing can be done with commercial flight and they are correct ; today it ca n't be done			0
but when the @entity127 first flew in 1903 , and @entity128 crossed the @entity129 in 1927 , no one would have imagined then that a plane carrying 300 passengers could make the same trip			0
" industry experts are taking a keen interest in the project			0
@entity137 's sir @entity136 is a sponsor , and according to @entity108 , he is thinking of using solar power to tow aircraft onto the runway -- a process that could save up to two tons of fuel per flight			2
" our goal is not to make a revolution in air transport , because it would be arrogance for us to try and do this , " he says			0
" really , we want to make a revolution in the mindset of the people			0

@entity19 and @entity21 *invited* *aeronautics* and engineering students to come up with ideas for a futuristic aircraft
ideas *include* planes powered by batteries , body heat and cow manure , luggage that floats and a shape - shifting jet engine
some of the *proposals* could cut co2 emissions by 97 % .
