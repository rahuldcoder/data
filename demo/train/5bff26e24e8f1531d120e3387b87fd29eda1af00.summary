what would happen if the legend of the @entity3 was crossed with the screenplay of @entity6 's 1995 hit movie " waterworld " ? maybe something like @entity9 -- an underwater metropolis that generates energy from the seabed and is capable of providing homes and accommodation for 5,000 people			1
sure , such blue - sky thinking may only seem plausible in the world of @entity18 , but this is the futuristic concept proposed by @entity20 construction firm @entity19 according to literature released by the company , expertise is being sought from @entity26 , @entity20 government ministries as well as energy firms to bring the project to life			1
@entity29 also say projects like the @entity9 may be necessary in the future to confront increasing global problems such as rising sea levels and the need to create new , clean energy sources			1
under the sea divided into three distinctive zones , the structure will stretch all the way to the crushing black depths 2.8 miles under the sea off the coast of @entity20			2
a giant sphere with a diameter 500 meters ( 1,640 feet ) situated just below the surface will form the first section and house residential zones , businesses and hotels			2
this inhabited area will be connected to a nine - mile spiral ( section 2 ) that that descends to the seabed where a deep - sea submarine port and factory ( section 3 ) will create the energy required to power the sphere by using micro-organisms that turn carbon dioxide into methane			0
if that 's not high - tech enough , power generators situated along the spiral will then use differences in seawater temperature to create additional energy by applying thermal conversion technologies			0
technology wait @entity29 has a history of imaginative , high - concept projects including a space hotel and floating botanical cities			0
the company says the @entity9 would take five years to build and the technology required will be ready in 15 years			1
funding for what is likely to be a cash intensive exercise will also have to be secured			0
until such times arrive , all we 're left with is a series of cool artist renderings to whet ( or should that be wet ? ) our appetites .			0

@entity9 is a proposed underwater city from @entity20 construction firm @entity19
the futuristic *settlement* has been designed to produce all its own energy and will have enough room to house 5,000 people
project expertise is being sought from *academics* , @entity20 government departments and energy experts , the company says
