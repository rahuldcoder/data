@entity0 -- as @entity3 leaves @entity4 , he hopes he hit the jackpot			1
following an hour and a half hour meeting tuesday afternoon with @entity10 billionaire @entity9 and a few aides , the presumptive @entity7 nominee was assured the casino magnate was fully supportive of him			1
@entity9 , who @entity13 magazine estimates is worth $ 24.9 billion and is ranked as the eighth - richest man in @entity16 , was largely responsible , along with his wife , @entity17 , for keeping @entity19 's presidential bid alive by giving $ 20 million to the super pac backing the @entity23 speaker 's candidacy , winning our future			1
now with @entity28 out of the race , political analysts are looking to see when @entity9 will put his next big bet down -- this one on @entity3			1
@entity9 did not attend a high - profile @entity3 fund - raiser tuesday night at the @entity31 but later went to a smaller dessert donor reception at a private residence with @entity3 and @entity28 , a source familiar with the event told @entity1			1
the key motivation for @entity9 this campaign is preventing the re-election of president @entity39 , those knowledgeable about the billionaire 's thinking have said			1
he reportedly sees republicans as stronger proponents for @entity46 's safety , which friends have said trumps all other concerns for him and was a key factor in his support for @entity28 , a longtime friend of his			2
" he is very focused on defeating @entity39 , " one friend told @entity1			2
" he is going to be the @entity7 's 800 - pound gorilla in defeating @entity39			1
' during the @entity7 primaries , @entity9 told associates that he would back whoever won the nomination and that he now fully supports @entity3 , sources have told @entity1			1
about a dozen financial backers of @entity3 and other major @entity7 donors met with @entity9 in @entity4 while they were in town for a meeting of the @entity64 to convince him to " come on board " with respect to supporting @entity3			1
he indicated to them , according to one of the participants , " it is just a matter of time			2
" however , the question is when and how much			2
as of april 30 , he had not given to the @entity73 , @entity74			0
when @entity4 columnist @entity75 asked @entity9 in late april whether he was going to donate to restore our future , he said , " i 'm not going to tell you			1
... you 'll find out when it 's reported			0
" @entity9 said at the time he wanted to become less visible in the political world and that references to him being a mogul when his donations were reported were " not helpful to that person			1
" asked if he was going to give to the @entity7 super @entity85 or its nonprofit affiliate @entity87 , he initially would not answer			1
later , he said to @entity75 , " i 'm going to give one more small donation -- you might not think it 's that small -- to a super pac and then if i give it will be to a @entity92 , " referring to 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) nonprofit groups , such as @entity87 , which are not required to disclose their donors			0
while he has been complimentary of @entity3 in some private sessions , according to one source familiar with the matter , he also has publicly criticized him for lacking decisiveness -- an attribute he said @entity28 demonstrated			1
" he 's not the bold decision - maker like @entity19 is			0
he does n't want to -- every time i talk to him , he says , ' well , let me think about it , ' " @entity9 told @entity101 at the end of march			2
@entity9 has been a prolific donor to @entity7 causes			1
earlier this year , he and his wife each donated $ 2.5 million to the @entity109 , a group dedicated to keeping the @entity7 majority in the @entity111			1
the @entity112 hosted a fund - raiser in april for @entity111 speaker @entity115 's re-election campaign			0
according to the @entity116 , a nonpartisan group that tracks the role of money in politics , @entity120 and @entity122 rank as the top individuals funding outside spending groups this election cycle			0
in february , when @entity28 still seemed to have a shot at the @entity7 nomination , @entity9 told @entity13 he might give as much as $ 100 million to support the former @entity111 speaker			1
what is unclear is whether he will follow through giving that amount to others			0
in that interview , he defended his donations and said he had nothing for which to apologize			0
" i 'm against very wealthy people attempting to influence elections , " he said			0
" but as long as it 's doable , i 'm going to do it			0
because i know that guys like ( @entity141 ) @entity140 have been doing it for years , if not decades			0
and they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money			0
i have my own philosophy , and i 'm not ashamed of it			0
i gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it			2
i do n't want to go through 10 different corporations to hide my name			0
i 'm proud of what i do , and i 'm not looking to escape recognition			0
" the @entity157 came under some criticism from @entity7 for their support of the super pac backing @entity28 , especially when it aired bitter ads in january questioning @entity3 's record at @entity164 and also when it became clear that @entity28 's candidacy had stalled			1
one friend said @entity9 saw his support as fulfilling his commitment to @entity28			2
@entity9 reacted to the critics in the @entity13 interview : " those people are either jealous or professional critics			2
" he added : " they like to trash other people			0
it 's unfair that i 've been treated unfair -- but it does n't stop me			0
