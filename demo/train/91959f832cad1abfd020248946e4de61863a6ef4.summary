-- perhaps there are still some people asking , " @entity3 who ? " too bad			1
they 've been missing something special			0
the " @entity8 " host shuffles off the stage friday having hosted an eccentric decade of shows , a program that was often under the radar but always quietly , distinctively ... @entity3			1
put aside the deliberately absurd characters like @entity14 and @entity15 , or the award of a @entity17 to guests who knew how to play the harmonica , or the silly theme song			0
every talk show has its shtick			2
what made @entity3 's talk show so different from the others was his determination to go off - script			1
not since the heyday of @entity29 , or maybe even @entity30 , had a network host so willingly put himself on the high wire			2
@entity3 's chops were most obvious right at the beginning of the show , when he did his loose , unstructured monologue			1
other times he was positively riveting , as when he eulogized his father and mother or gleefully announced his newly gained @entity41 citizenship			0
or , particularly , the 2007 night he spent more than 12 minutes discussing his alcoholism			0
@entity3 had no truck with the " late - night wars " -- he was friendly with @entity45 and @entity46 , and @entity47 will be on his final show -- and he was willing to follow his guests wherever they took him			1
he started interviews by ripping up the blue cards other hosts depend on , and if his guests wanted to talk about religion and existence -- like @entity55 , who was the only guest one night in 2013 -- or nothing in particular -- like frequent visitor @entity57 -- he just went along with it			0
he even credited a guest , @entity59 , with leading him to leave the show , in the best possible way			2
" @entity59 saying ' be as authentically crazy as you are			0
' it was kind of like @entity64 saying ' just be as crazy as you like			0
' i felt weirdly released by that , " he told an audience monday at @entity68 ' @entity67			0
" then , ultimately , that leads to me not doing the show			2
" it 's a typically unpredictable finish for an unpredictable performer			0
but then , @entity3 has often surprised			1
@entity75 was expected of a guy formerly known as mr. @entity77 on " the @entity78 , " but @entity3 cut his teeth in @entity81 's fringe scene , notably as a character named " @entity3			1
" he had range and smarts			0
( @entity86 tangent : @entity3 was also a punk rock drummer , and the singer in his band was @entity89			1
@entity89 is now known as @entity90 but -- for discerning fans -- is the scathingly profane @entity92 of " @entity93			0
" @entity3 , of course , did a whole show pegged to " @entity90 " just because he wanted to			1
) @entity97 , the " @entity8 's " producer and the man @entity3 called " boss , " knew he had something special			1
" his show was unlike any other late night show , and i 'm telling you , to be unique in the world of television -- virtually impossible , " @entity97 said when @entity3 made his announcement			1
@entity109 actor @entity108 will take over in march			0
at the @entity111 event , @entity3 told him not to worry			1
" i 've set the bar very low , " he said			0
it 's more like he set the bar on the other side of the room and then limboed under it , did pull - ups with it and threw it like a javelin , letting it land where it may			2
@entity3 has been quiet about his future			2
he 's been hosting " celebrity name game , " a syndicated game show , but it seems like there 's room for something a little crazier , a little more unusual			1
who knows what tomorrow may bring ? after all , tomorrow 's just a future yesterday .			0

@entity3 's final " @entity8 " is friday
@entity3 has been unusual host , letting his show wander
he 's also been *forthright* and honest in his monologues
