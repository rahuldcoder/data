editor 's note : actor and writer @entity2 has appeared widely on television , including on " @entity5 , " " @entity8 " and " @entity9 , " and in films and theater			1
he writes a syndicated column and is the author of the book , " he talk like a @entity14			2
" @entity2 with his wife , @entity16 , of 14 years , and their children , @entity19 , 10 , @entity20 , 8 , and @entity21 , 6			1
( @entity22 ) -- i was truly honored to participate in the @entity22 documentary " black in @entity25			2
" as often happens in projects of such ambition , it is difficult for everyone to have sufficient time to flesh out ideas			1
though i went on tape with the program 's producers for several hours , it just was n't possible to explore all of my ideas at length			1
working in @entity38 , i am used to ending up on the cutting room floor			0
that 's life in the big city			0
@entity43 and i had a long conversation about sentencing disparities among black and white criminals -- specifically , the disparity between sentencing for crack cocaine and powder cocaine			1
the context of our conversation concerned whether the sentencing disparity was evidence of the racism inherent in the criminal justice system			1
despite efforts by the @entity62 and the @entity63 to increase flexibility in sentencing , the punishment for possession by a first - time offender of more than 5 grams of crack cocaine is a minimum 5 - year prison sentence -- while possession of any amount of powder cocaine is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than a year in prison			1
in the mid- 1980s , when these mandatory minimum sentences came into effect , @entity25 was experiencing a surge in violent crime , much of it fueled by the introduction of a new and extremely profitable ( to say nothing of addictive ) form of cocaine -- crack			1
there was tremendous violence associated with the crack cocaine trade as drug gangs fought over territory			1
the media told us that our neighborhoods were filling with crack babies -- children born addicted to cocaine because their mothers smoked the deadly toxin while pregnant			1
our representatives in @entity96 , particularly the @entity97 , decided to take a tough stance and supported harsh sentencing guidelines for selling crack cocaine			1
i have little sympathy for men and women who prey on the innocent hardworking members of the community			0
i am particularly critical of men who are guilty of criminal behavior , as this runs counter to what i see as one of the primary duties of men : to be guardians of the home and of the community , not parasites on that community			0
i am , however , uncertain that society gains very much by sentencing thousands of young black men to prison for nonviolent drug offenses			0
the sentences introduce them to a system from which it is difficult to extricate themselves and begins the downward path to joblessness , absentee fatherhood and more criminal behavior -- in short , creating more of the very behavior we are trying to discourage			0
the disparity in the guidelines ' impact does not in my mind prove systemic racism			1
i would , however , argue that it does not represent the best the @entity25 justice system has to offer and in fact undermines faith in that very system , especially among black folk			0
studies show that more than 50 percent of inmates have drug and alcohol problems			0
when we are discussing nonviolent offenders , i think it may be prudent to spend a bit more time with rehabilitation as opposed to tossing folk in jail			1
we have tried for many years to attack the supply side of this equation ; it is in my humble opinion time to begin addressing the demand side and approach the drug war as a health issue			2
we also need to get a handle on single parenthood and absentee fathers			0
responsible members of our community can not stress enough the effects of single parenthood on the development of children and how that development translates into criminal behavior in the community			2
studies indicate that nearly 90 percent of the change in violent crime rates in a neighborhood can be accounted for by the change in percentages of out - of - wedlock births			1
children from fatherless homes are : 9 times more likely to drop out of high school			0
10 times more likely to abuse chemical substances			0
20 times more likely to end up in prison			0
a change in the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine will have very little effect if we do not begin to commit this community to raising our children in two - parent homes			1
finally , there must be a corresponding responsibility on the part of citizens to avoid drugs and alcohol and obey the law			0
there must also be a continued demand by the rest of us that our fellow citizens engage in moral and ethical behavior			0
we must insist that concepts like nobility , duty and honor are not sacrificed on the altar of relativism			0
nothing distresses me more than the e-mails i receive attempting to explain away the antisocial and criminal behavior of some of our neighbors as the result of poverty and or racism			2
( @entity222 unanswered , of course , is why they who have also been targets of racism and economic hardship are not engaged in criminal behavior			2
) to suggest that people attempt to live lives of virtue is not simplistic			1
it is in fact wisdom that is preached in our houses of worship each and every sabbath day			0
whether it concerns sexual behavior , decisions concerning our education or how we conceive of civil behavior , when it comes to creating lives of purpose and fulfillment nothing will replace the individual accessing the wisdom that has been passed down from antiquity			2
in the words of the poet @entity250 : it matters not how strait the gate , how charged with punishments the scroll , i am the master of my fate : i am the captain of my soul			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

first - time possession of crack carries more severe sentence than powder cocaine
@entity2 : disparity does n't prove racism , it was *prompted* by 1980s crime wave
one - parent families are responsible for many social ills , he says
people should try to live virtuous lives and take control of their fate , @entity2 says
