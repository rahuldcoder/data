-- aircraft including long - range bombers may be used in any eventual strike on @entity6 , but " that does not fundamentally change the parameters of the mission , " a @entity2 official said			1
another official from the @entity11 said the @entity12 has been calling the @entity11 almost every day asking questions about @entity2 options in @entity6 and the feasibility of different plans			1
" they 're not the experts on this , we are			0
so it 's our job to lay out what it would take to accomplish @entity25 or @entity26 , " the defense official said			2
the questions from the @entity12 involve escalating the scope of the mission , but " in increments -- nothing that 's out of line with the original plans			0
from the start , we have always been developing a range of options , depending on what they ultimately wanted to do , " the defense official said			2
@entity2 assets and key locations the first official said planners have had what he described as " incremental inquiries into what we might apply , due to how things have been developing on the ground , " but added that no final decision has been made on which assets to deploy and that a decision could still be a ways off			1
" i would n't get out ahead of anything here , " the official told @entity0			0
" you want to match the military effort to the target sets			0
those target sets have changed , but they 're probably going to continue to change even more , " he said			0
the official characterized the bombers only as options and pushed back on any notion of @entity2 pilots flying over @entity6 airspace			1
" you can employ stand - off weapons from an aircraft , just as easily as from a ship or submarine			2
aerial assets can be used from a distance , " he said			0
the official was responding to a report from @entity76 ' @entity75 , who is traveling with president @entity77 in @entity78 , that said the @entity2 attack plan for @entity6 could potentially include missiles fired from @entity81 and b - 52 bombers flying from the @entity2			1
the @entity83 , meanwhile , has reported that the @entity11 was preparing to employ greater firepower to reach shifting military targets			0
the revised options under development include the use of @entity91 bombers to supplement @entity2 destroyers in the @entity93 , the newspaper said			2
@entity2 long - range bombers such as the @entity95 , @entity81 and @entity96 are equipped with joint air - to - surface missiles , designed to destroy both mobile and fixed targets			1
the missiles ' primary advantage is that they allow pilots to operate outside the lethal range of most hostile air defense systems			0
the @entity2 has b - 1 bombers stationed at @entity107 in @entity108 , which also operates as a forward headquarters for @entity110 .			1

long - range aircraft may be used in an attack on @entity6 , @entity2 official says
no final decision has been made about what assets may be used , official says
@entity121 was responding to an @entity76 report of the *possibility* of using bombers
