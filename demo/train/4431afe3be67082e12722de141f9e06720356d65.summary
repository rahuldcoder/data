@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 and her husband , @entity5 , both say they agree almost all the time , with one exception : the @entity7 , president @entity9 's health care legislation			1
" we 're kind of split on that one , " @entity4 says			2
" it 's one of the few heated discussions we have			0
right now , i 'm at the point where i 've already told ( @entity5 ) that ' ok , if the person you want gets elected , sit back and watch			0
' we 're in a little standoff about that one			0
there 's never blood drawn , but it gets interesting			0
" @entity24 , a 62 - year - old retired @entity25 veteran , just rolls his eyes			2
" i did not like the way it was shoved down our throats , " @entity5 responds			0
" what about the people that ca n't afford health insurance ? what part of not being able to afford it does n't our president understand ? there are people out there working just to put bread on the table , and now he 's saying ' i do n't care if your family eats or not			1
' " @entity5 's wife is having a hard time paying her health insurance			1
according to @entity50 , a liberal - leaning health insurance advocacy group , @entity4 's situation is common			1
families @entity50 reported that before the passage of the @entity7 , some 2.3 million @entity53 families lost their health care each year because of price			1
the group believes the @entity7 will help families from being priced out of health insurance coverage			1
he says it 's unfair to penalize his wife if she decides not to pay for coverage			2
he supports @entity65 candidate @entity64			0
and @entity5 has health insurance through the @entity67			1
but @entity4 , who is quickly using up her life savings to pay her monthly health premium , is fully supportive of @entity7 , and supports @entity71 president @entity9 in his re-election bid			1
but in ironic fashion , the reason this debate has come to the @entity24 household is because the couple decided to get married			2
watch behind the scenes interview with @entity4 after getting married , the couple moved into a ranch style home on the banks of @entity82 , just north of @entity83			2
but before they started a life together , @entity4 was married for almost 50 years			2
the @entity1 native married her ex-husband at age 15			0
@entity4 raised two children , maintained the house , and painted portraits and landscapes on the side			2
" i held one job during my marriage , working as an art instructor , " @entity4 says			2
" it was n't for very long , and it was n't for many hours per week			0
" after a long , unhappy marriage , @entity4 got divorced in her mid- 60s			0
during the separation , @entity4 learned she did not work enough during her life to qualify for @entity101 or reduced cost @entity102			2
so , she negotiated with her ex-husband , and he agreed to give her a small lump sum of money , along with subsidizing her health care premiums			1
while she was single , @entity4 paid just over $ 200 per month			0
" then i got married , and the whole thing changed , " @entity4 says			0
now , she pays $ 703 per month			0
when she remarried , @entity4 's ex-husband no longer paid any part of her health premium			1
she could n't qualify for @entity111 , the government 's health care program for the poor , because she had to count @entity5 's retirement income of about $ 2000 per month			1
so , @entity4 had to turn to her life savings			1
" what i do is i 've got it set up where i get $ 1,000 a month , it 's like a trust , to pay my insurance and everything else , " @entity4 says			1
" it wo n't last me for a lifetime , i think , but right now , my insurance is taken care of			0
" read @entity4 's original story on @entity128 what 's important about @entity4 's story , says @entity131 , is that it illustrates how routine life changes can dramatically change individual health care costs			1
@entity131 is the executive director of @entity135 , a @entity136 - based nonpartisan , not - for - profit think tank			0
" a family 's health insurance rate can change for a variety of reasons , both a birth in the family , a death in the family , a divorce , " says @entity131			1
" even somebody just doing the very natural thing of reaching ( their ) birthday			0
one of the worst birthday presents you can receive is a rate increase from your health insurer			0
" the presidential candidates each offer dramatically different policies on how to handle rate changes			0
in the most general terms , @entity131 says , @entity9 's signature health care law makes it harder to increase rates for routine life changes , while @entity65 candidate @entity64 wants to repeal that law entirely			1
" we 've always had candidates with different proposals , but we 've never had an election which would really determine whether a whole set of benefits and consumer protections were at stake , where the line was so clearly drawn , " he adds			0
how have you been affected by the health care ruling ? share your story with @entity128			1
@entity131 says @entity4 could benefit from some of the provisions of the @entity7 , like the expansion of @entity111			1
the health care program serves low income citizens , and is run jointly by the federal government and the states			1
yet , it 's unclear how those provisions will be applied in the @entity24 's home state of @entity1			2
@entity71 gov. @entity187 will ultimately have to approve any expansion of @entity111 and @entity102 in his state			0
those are the provisions most likely to help @entity4 lower her @entity102 premiums			2
yet , the @entity71 governor has issued statements indicating he is still studying the law and the recent @entity53 @entity196 ruling			2
@entity197 : face - off on @entity196 ruling many @entity1 @entity65 have taken the position of gov. @entity200 of @entity201			0
the former @entity65 presidential candidate has long argued that @entity7 provisions , like expanding @entity111 , will bankrupt individual states			2
@entity200 , like @entity24 , also disagrees with the health care law on philosophical grounds			1
" i will not be party to socializing health care and bankrupting my state in direct contradiction to our @entity212 and our founding principles of limited government , " @entity200 said in a statement shortly after the @entity53 @entity196 ruling			1
now that the @entity53 @entity196 has ruled @entity7 is constitutional , @entity131 of @entity135 says the outcome of this presidential election will determine whether the law is ultimately fully enforced			1
from a health care perspective , @entity131 says this election is " the most important " in @entity53 history			1
yet , despite the potential importance this election may have on their day - to - day lives , @entity4 and @entity24 may decide , as a couple , simply not to vote			1
" we 'll just end up canceling each other out , " @entity4 says			0
" but if we do decide to skip the vote , at least we 're doing it together			0
life is better with someone you love			0

and track the @entity237 's progress on our map .			0

@entity4 remarried says she 's using life savings to pay for health insurance premiums
