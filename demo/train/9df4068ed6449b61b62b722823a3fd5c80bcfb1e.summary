for years , as @entity2 basked in the glow of an adoring public , his critics frequently were banished to the shadows , dismissed by the cycling legend and his coterie as cranks or worse			1
now , with @entity2 stripped of his titles and endorsement deals , those who spoke out against him before it was the popular thing to do are feeling vindicated			1
" eleven years of bullying and threats , " @entity13 , the wife of cyclist @entity14 -- one of @entity2 's earliest targets -- wrote on @entity17			1
" @entity20 is now the @entity21 in the @entity22			0
" in some cases , vindication could also mean getting back huge sums of money			0
a @entity28 insurance company that once refused to pay @entity2 a promised $ 5 million bonus for winning a @entity30 , citing reports that he had doped , ended up having to pay it plus his legal costs			1
all told , over the years @entity33 paid $ 12 million			1
now , it is " considering all legal options " to get its money back			0
@entity38 's @entity37 has also said it may sue @entity2 over a libel case he brought against the newspaper that resulted in a costly payout			2
this turning of the tide comes after cycling 's international governing body , the @entity42 , agreed with the @entity48 's decision to strip @entity2 of his seven @entity30 titles			2
the move concluded a stunning few weeks of freefall for @entity2 , beginning with the release of hundreds of pages of testimony and other evidence describing @entity2 's involvement in what @entity48 called the most sophisticated doping program in cycling history			1
among other things , the report included affidavits from key @entity2 critics @entity64 and @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , all of whom spoke out against @entity2 and , in various ways , paid the price			1
@entity64 and @entity65 once a close friend of @entity2 , cyclist @entity73 had a falling out with him after his wife , @entity75 , began to cooperate with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against @entity2			1
according to @entity64 and @entity65 , they were in an @entity81 hospital room when @entity2 acknowledged to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance - enhancing drugs			1
opinion : is it time to allow doping in sport ? they later testified about the incident during the arbitration case filed against @entity2 by a company seeking to avoid paying out bonuses to @entity2 for race victories during which he was accused of doping			1
it was a decision they would pay for , according to @entity73			0
" i have been told that my public disputes with @entity2 have made it more difficult for others in the cycling industry to work with me because they fear reprisal from @entity2 and his associates , " he said in his affidavit released by @entity48			2
his wife said she was pressured to sign a statement disavowing the story , and when she refused , was " vilified			0
" " i became , in @entity2 's words , ' bitter ' and ' vindictive ' and ' jealous , ' " she said in her affidavit			2
she recently told @entity111 that " grown men were torn to shreds by @entity2 , " and said she was " extremely grateful " to @entity48 for its investigation			2
' what @entity116 thinks of me i do n't care , " @entity73 told the @entity118			0
" i care what my family and close friends think of me			0
when it affects my husband 's ability to work then it 's grossly unfair			0
who knows how many jobs he lost because i refused to lie to protect @entity2			2
" @entity66 on @entity17 recently , @entity2 's former personal assistant said things started getting easier for her when the @entity48 report came out and " people started realising i was n't some ' prostitute ' liar ! " that 's what @entity66 , the former soigneur -- part masseuse , part go - fer for the @entity136 -- says @entity2 called her when she went public with accusations against him			1
like @entity65 , she first told her story in the @entity141 book " @entity143 , " co-written by sports reporter @entity142 of @entity38 's @entity37			1
she told @entity48 that she went on a clandestine trip to pick up and drop off what she assumed were doping products for @entity2			1
she also said she was in the room when @entity2 and two other team officials came up with a plan to backdate a prescription for corticosteroids for a saddle sore to explain a positive steroid test result during the @entity154			1
" now , @entity66 , you know enough to bring me down , " she says @entity2 told her after the meeting			1
speaking in the aftermath of the @entity48 report 's release , @entity66 told @entity160 she went through " two - and - a - half to three years of hell " after she first made the decision to speak out about doping			1
" i got subpoenaed , i got ... kind of ostracized and just the stress levels ... and all for telling the truth			0
as well as feeling feelings of guilt because i knew then that there were certain people now who would not speak to me again , and have never spoken to me again , and it 's a shame because i lost those friendships			0
" @entity66 said she regretted making life difficult for the cyclists and her friends in the business , who would now be viewed with suspicion			2
she also faced lawsuits brought by @entity2 's legal teams that totaled well over $ 1 million			1
@entity2 " wanted to play the libel laws in the @entity179 and keep me quiet because he had much more money than me , " @entity66 said			1
" by putting a gag on most of us who had spoken out , it stopped people talking , it stopped it going to the press , because then the press were scared because of how much it would cost them , and their legal bills for a ( minor ) sport			0
" and then he 'd just slate ( criticize ) us all as well -- i was an ' alcoholic prostitute , ' for my efforts			0
" nonetheless , @entity66 said her overwhelming feeling in the wake of the @entity48 report was one of sadness , rather than vindication			2
" sadness for all the people who got bullied , and sadness that the sport kind of got a bit tinged with all of this when there 's so many good people ... and sadness , too , that it came out in 2004 and i got vilified for it , and now all of a sudden i 'm telling the truth			1
my story has n't changed since 2004			0
i 've always been telling the truth			0
it 's just times were different then			0
" @entity142 the @entity179 journalist who co-wrote " @entity143 -- @entity219 " said he took his share of abuse , as well			1
" he called me ' the worst journalist in the world , ' referred to me as ' the little f * * * g troll , ' tried to pressure @entity65 ( a source for @entity143 ) into discrediting me and , of course , he sued , " @entity220 wrote in a piece for @entity222 monday			0
" that lawsuit now seems as close as you can get to an ' @entity231 ' in our game			0
" @entity220 describes how his claims that @entity2 doped made him " a black sheep of the cycling family , " shunned by those inside the cycling world and given the cold shoulder by fellow journalists who feared associating with him would cost them access , too			2
opinion : with @entity2 's disgrace , will anything change ? " it 's been a good journey because the truth was never hard to find in this story			2
you only had to be interested in looking			0
what made it interesting was how many people @entity2 had watching his back , " @entity220 wrote			1
" in the highest places he had friends			0
but he could n't stop @entity73 , @entity66 , ( ex-new @entity256 cyclist @entity255 and others from telling stories that contradicted his , and you had to spend only 10 minutes in their company to know they were n't lying			1
they could n't be bullied into silence			1
" @entity220 also paid tribute to the courage of @entity66 and @entity65 on @entity17 , as those " who told the truth 10 years ago , without being compelled to do so " despite the pressure not to speak out			1
that pressure had an ugly face , @entity220 said			0
" @entity2 insinuated @entity66 was an " alcoholic whore			1
" he and his legal bouncers portrayed @entity75 as " a jealous bitch			0
" @entity67 @entity67 acknowledged doping on the @entity277 news show " @entity278 " in may 2011 and said he had seen @entity2 doing it , as well			2
he accused @entity219 of trying to intimidate him over the revelation			0
having first tested positive for doping in 2004 , @entity67 said he continued to lie -- pointing to what he called omerta , or " the code of silence ... within the top tier of cycling " as a reason			2
" i believed that was my only way back into the sport , " he said			0
" it is a bit of a mafia			0
it 's a powerful group			0
you can say the wrong thing , and next thing you know ... "			0
