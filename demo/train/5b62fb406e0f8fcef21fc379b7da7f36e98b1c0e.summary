@entity0 -- students in many districts across @entity4 brushed off their uniforms and shouldered their bookbags for the first day of the new school year on wednesday			1
but while most were worried about meeting their new teachers or what their class schedules might be , some were facing the threat of nuclear contamination or the loss of former classmates			2
in @entity0 , a group of students evacuated from the @entity19 area began the school year in a new city and a new classroom			1
@entity22 , 7 , is one of several children staying at a youth center in @entity4 's capital as their parents in the north work or take care of worse - off family members			1
" i just got a letter from my mom , " he said			0
" it says that she is hurting because we 're separated			0
but she says do n't worry , we will go home together after the nuclear power plant settles down			0
" " i have n't got used to the life yet , because i have to live separately from my mom , " he said walking into the @entity38			0
" up in northern @entity4 , where the worst devastation from last month 's tsunami occurred , the new school year has been delayed several weeks			1
dozens of schools were wiped out or too badly damaged to reopen in @entity46			1
governments and educators are scrambling to repair schools , round up teachers and cope with the tens of thousands of displaced people			2
a different set of problems in @entity19 , where authorities have begun testing schools , kindergartens and playgrounds across the prefecture after parents expressed worries about high levels of radiation			1
teams of researchers will monitor 1,428 locations over three days ending thursday to try to reassure the public about safety outside the 20 - kilometer exclusion zone around the damaged @entity69 nuclear power plant			1
the testing coincides with the beginning of the new school year in the prefecture , as tens of thousands of students return to classes			1
" as the elementary schools starts on april 6th , we 've heard many of the concern from the parents whether the schools are safe enough to have their children to attend , " an officer at @entity76 told @entity1			1
" in response to it , we conduct to check radiation level to secure the ( safety ) of the children			0
" authorities have announced repeatedly that there is little danger of contamination in the region , but there are monitoring stations across the country on watch			0
government surveys are being taken several times daily by authorities from the area directly surrounding the damaged reactor , focusing on radiation " hot spots " such as ponds , low spots and drains where snow runoff and wind would naturally concentrate radiation			1
the spots with the highest levels of radiation wednesday were just northwest of the plant , outside the 20 - kilometer zone , with one spot registering 50.9 microsieverts			2
in comparison , the @entity116 emergency site where workers are stationed at the cusp of the 20 - kilometer zone showed a reading of just 1.1 microsieverts			2
a person in a developed nation is naturally exposed to about 3,000 microsieverts a year			0
the readings fluctuate over the day and change with wind patterns , but could also be showing that small amounts of radiation from debris and dust continue to come from the reactor site			0
no information is being released for sites inside the exclusion zone			0
the information , compiled by the @entity136 , @entity137 , sports , science and technology ( @entity138 ) , may eventually help create a " minefield map " of spots and transportation routes that are better to be avoided or closed off to the public			0
and in @entity0 , the radiation level has been dropping over recent days , as low wind speeds have limited the scattering of radiation from the north			2
