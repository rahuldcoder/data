-- the @entity2 's new super stealthy destroyer , the @entity3 , has a lot in common with @entity6 's starship enterprise , according to folks who 've seen it in person			1
much has been written about the @entity11 's appropriately named commander , capt. @entity10			1
but aside from that coincidence , the ship 's operations center utilizes advanced technology that takes multitasking to a deadly new level on the high seas			1
first launched last year , this is a massive $ 3 billion warship -- the largest type of destroyer in the modern @entity2 by about 65 %			1
one thing that sets it apart is a very small crew			2
compared with about 300 sailors needed for similar warships , the @entity11 's minimum compliment is only 130			1
the smaller crew is made possible by advanced automated systems which " make it much easier and much more effective for the sailor to operate , " says former navy capt. @entity31 , who now serves as @entity33 program director for @entity35 contractor , @entity34			1
in the operations center -- which in many ways is the heart of the ship -- sailors are surrounded by an array of video displays that have been designed to be used by a generation raised on video games , @entity31 says			1
@entity34 tested the technology configuration in the operation center with young , gamer sailors , @entity31 says			2
" we 've brought them down to our labs and we got direct feedback from them using human - factor engineers in order to make sure that we 've integrated all the displays and information in a way that they can use the systems most effectively			0
" the result , he says , is less chance of making errors on the ship			0
" the system and the computer provide information to the sailor in a way that they 're used to			0
" work stations inside the center are outfitted with three common displays , @entity31 says			2
" you can sit down at any of the systems and operate them			0
" at 610 feet long and 80 feet wide , the @entity11 is about 100 feet longer and 20 feet wider than ships in the @entity2 's current fleet of @entity78 featured in the action - packed 2012 film " @entity81			1
" although it 's huge , the @entity2 says this thing is surprisingly stealthy			1
much of the ship is built on angles that help make it 50 times harder to spot on radar than an ordinary destroyer			0
" it has the radar cross-section of a fishing boat , " @entity90 , a spokesman for @entity91 , told @entity0 last year			0
meet capt. @entity10 , commander of the @entity3 @entity95 , of the self - described " alpha geek " website @entity96 , got a chance last year to explore a mockup of the @entity11 's operation center			1
the workstations are part of the ship 's @entity103 -- nicknamed " keds " for short , @entity95 reported			2
sailors operate keds with " trackballs and specialized button panels , " @entity95 reported			0
operators have an option to interface by using touchscreens , if they prefer , according to @entity95			0
the whole operations center technology array saves manpower by allowing sailors to monitor multiple weapons systems or sensors , @entity95 reported			1
the @entity11 , @entity95 wrote , also includes limited wireless networking capability			2
" theoretically , the ship could even be steered from the ops centerâ € ” the ship is piloted by computer , not a helmsman , " @entity95 wrote			0
@entity103 displays are built into the " commanding officer 's and executive officer 's chairs on the bridge , " he reported			0
the way all the ship 's weapons , radar and other systems are displayed to users and the captain , @entity31 told @entity0 , " it really give them unprecedented situational awareness			0
" " that ability is truly going to be a game - changer			2
" in its current configuration , the @entity11 will carry a considerable arsenal of weapons , including two @entity144 ( @entity144 ) , which can fire rocket - powered , computer - guided shells that can destroy targets 63 miles away			1
that 's three times farther than ordinary destroyer guns can fire			2
but one day it could be fitted with advanced weapons systems that are currently experimental , including a laser weapon and an electromagnetic railgun			0
electromagnetic railguns do n't need to fool around with needless explosive warheads or propellants			0
these fearsome weapons inflict damage by sheer speed			0
the gun uses electromagnetic force to blast a missile 125 miles at 7.5 times the speed of sound , according to the @entity2			0
the laser weapon -- which could be fired by one sailor on a video game - like console -- is designed to take on aircraft or small surface vessels			1
read more about the @entity2 's plans for new weapons currently undergoing sea testing , @entity31 says the @entity11 is expected to join the rest of the @entity2 fleet sometime in 2016 .			1

@entity2 's new destroyer @entity3 boasts operations center *bristling* with new technology
advanced workstations allow one sailor to do the work of several on older warships
although the @entity11 is the @entity2 's largest destroyer , it has a small minimum crew of about 130
the operations center is designed to be used by the video - game generation
