pope @entity1 canonized five new saints sunday in a @entity8 at @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity11 , better known as @entity11 , was elevated to sainthood along with the four others in a solemn mass that was moved indoors from @entity16 to the @entity9 in @entity10 because of an early morning thunderstorm			2
thousands attended , including the woman whose cure from cancer was attributed to her praying to @entity11			2
the church counts her cure as one of two miracles the priest performed -- a key requirement for sainthood			1
the others who were canonized sunday are : -- @entity29 , a @entity30 bishop who kept championing @entity31 after @entity32 shut down @entity30 churches in retaliation for the @entity30 uprising against @entity32 in @entity36 in 1861			1
-- @entity37 , a @entity38 nun who set up an order that runs homes for destitute around the world			1
-- @entity42 , a spaniard who founded an order of @entity44 in the 19th century			2
-- @entity45 , another @entity42 , who wrote extensively about spirituality before his death at age 27			2
@entity11 was born in @entity49 and went to @entity5 in the 1870s in place of his ill brother			1
at the time , the kingdom of @entity5 banished its leprosy patients to @entity55 , a 5 - square - mile village on the island of @entity57			1
because of the stigma attached to the disease , doctors refused to treat patients and society ostracized them			0
@entity11 volunteered to serve as pastor there , and did so for 16 years			0
he died at age 49 after contracting leprosy , which is now called @entity68 's disease			2
today , @entity55 is a national park and home to 25 residents , there because of the disease			0
all of them are cured , but have chosen to stay because it is their life - long home			0
@entity68 's disease is a bacterial disease characterized by skin sores , nerve damage and gradual debilitation			0
though it was once feared as highly contagious , it is not particularly transmissible and is easily treated with antibiotics			0
the @entity85 of @entity86 had long sought canonization for @entity11			0
sainthood is bestowed only after a thorough examination of the person 's life and requires two documented miracles			0
in @entity11 's case , the church considered the overnight healing 100 years ago of a @entity38 nun who was on her deathbed from an intestinal ailment			1
it also considered the case of @entity101 , a public school teacher , who fully recovered from liposarcoma in 1999 after she prayed to @entity11 , she said .			0
