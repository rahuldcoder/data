-- a federal judge on tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging @entity5 sen. @entity4 's write - in election victory last month , clearing the way for @entity4 to be sworn in for a second term next week			1
state officials have scheduled a thursday morning ceremony to sign the election certification , according to @entity11 , spokeswoman for gov. @entity12			1
the certification will then be flown to @entity14 to be delivered to the @entity15			0
shortly after the ruling , @entity5 's lieutenant governor , @entity16 , announced that the director of the @entity5 @entity19 had certified @entity4 as the winner , but his office later retracted that statement			2
the final vote count in the election was 101,091 to 90,839			2
@entity4 was defeated in the @entity26 primary in august by @entity27 , a @entity28 - backed candidate			1
@entity4 then waged the write - in campaign in the general election in november to defeat @entity27 , who filed a lawsuit challenging the result			1
@entity34 district judge @entity33 had previously issued an injunction to block certification of the election results pending a resolution of @entity27 's lawsuit			2
in his ruling tuesday , @entity33 said " the injunction is lifted and the @entity19 may certify the election results immediately			0
" in @entity5 , @entity51 's ruling " fully and finally resolved all claims raised by mr. @entity27 and stated that they have absolutely no merit and no chance of success , " said @entity43 , an attorney representing the @entity4 campaign			1
@entity27 said he was " disappointed with the federal court 's ruling , " adding that he still believes his challenge is on solid constitutional ground			1
" thus , we are evaluating the ruling and determining what our next step should be , " he said			0
earlier this month , the @entity60 ruled that the @entity5 @entity19 conducted the november 2 general election according to state law			0
@entity27 had claimed the way some votes were counted violated state law			0
in its ruling , the state @entity60 affirmed an earlier @entity69 decision , saying : " there are no remaining issues raised by @entity27 that prevent this election from being certified			0
" after the election in november , @entity27 filed a challenge against the @entity19 to ensure the state law , which calls for write - in votes to match the name of the candidate , was followed			1
he has argued that @entity5 law does not allow the counting of misspelled names on write - in ballots			0
however , the @entity19 set guidelines before counting began that allowed for a voter 's intent to be considered when determining whether to count a ballot for a write - in candidate			1
in the original @entity69 decisions , a judge ruled that @entity27 did not provide proof of election official fraud , or that " there would be a sufficient change to the election results if these claims were true			0
" the @entity95 called the race for @entity4 last month when she had a lead of more than 10,300 votes over @entity27 , a figure that included 8,159 ballots contested by @entity27 observers			0
not including the contested ballots , @entity4 's lead still exceeded 2,100 votes .			2
