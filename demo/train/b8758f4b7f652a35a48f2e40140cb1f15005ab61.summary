-- as the @entity5 flame burned above @entity6 on tuesday evening , a scene of mayhem and death exploded a few hundred miles away in the @entity8 capital , @entity9 , where blazes roared and violent clashes erupted along protesters ' barricades			1
at least 100 people were killed just on thursday and hundreds more hospitalized in confrontations pitting government forces against demonstrators opposed to a regime that has strong support from president @entity20			0
it was the deadliest day in the three months since the showdown started			0
between the two spectacles , you can bet @entity26 's attention focused more sharply on the crisis in @entity8 , which is officially an independent country since 1991 but in reality remains a state over which @entity30 exercises enormous influence , infuriating much of @entity8 's population			1
at the heart of the battle lies a fundamental question : is @entity8 a free nation or is it a piece of @entity30 -- a piece on @entity26 's chessboard ? the more immediate question is how far the @entity30 - backed regime will go to put down opposition protests			1
as it happens , both @entity6 and @entity8 play a large role in @entity26 's strategy			1
to @entity26 , staging a successful @entity5 is a way to consolidate power , to build up his image for domestic and international audiences , and to show a resurgent , self - assured and powerful @entity50 under his rule			1
what happens in @entity8 is part of the same larger objective , but it is far more important			2
@entity8 has experienced much bloodshed throughout its history , with foreign powers inflicting unspeakable devastation			2
since the collapse of the @entity62 , it has struggled to get back on its feet , with little success			0
a decade ago , pro-western demonstrators managed to depose a @entity30 - allied president , @entity66 , and replace him with a new leader who wanted closer ties to the @entity69			1
that uprising , known as the @entity71 , was part of a wave of " color revolutions " along @entity50 's borders , and it inspired protests in @entity50 , which @entity26 swiftly put down			1
the most recent crisis burst on the scene in november when @entity66 ( once again in power after his 1995 defeat ) decided not to sign a trade deal with the @entity82 , an agreement that would have increased links with the @entity69 and was fiercely opposed by @entity30			2
@entity50 wants the former @entity62 republics to join a @entity30 - centered customs union			2
the decision to turn away from @entity88 enraged the opposition , bringing hundreds of thousands of people to the streets of @entity9 and other @entity8 cities			1
protesters were incensed by what they saw , quite correctly , as acquiescence to @entity97 bullying			2
in august , when @entity8 officials were negotiating the @entity82 's eastern partnership agreement , @entity30 made it clear it would not tolerate a turn to the @entity69			1
@entity50 , @entity8 's principal trading partner , suddenly imposed crippling sanctions against @entity8 imports			1
@entity26 's top economic adviser explained it as " preventive measures " in case @entity8 decided to " take the suicidal step " of signing an agreement with the @entity82			1
@entity30 has used similar bullying tactics with other former @entity62 members			0
@entity113 had spent years working on a deal to join the @entity115			0
then abruptly in september , while pressure was coming down on @entity8 , the @entity113 president met with @entity26 in @entity30 and announced the end of the talks with @entity88 , triggering protests in the @entity113 capital			1
for @entity8 , the @entity82 deal symbolized a new future , the chance of economic and political modernization and rule of law			2
@entity88 required reforms as part of the deal			0
the @entity97 customs union cements the status quo			0
@entity26 offered @entity66 $ 15 billion in loans to help the country through its economic crisis			2
he also persuaded him to take a much harder line against protesters			0
the @entity8 president had repeatedly pledged not to use force against protesters			1
according to the @entity139 , he changed his mind after meeting with @entity26 in @entity6			1
ukrainians have long been divided between easterners , who favor close ties with @entity50 , and westerners , who feel more @entity88			2
but persistent economic stagnation and the ability to travel abroad and compare conditions have brought new impetus to calls for reform			0
the @entity8 economy is mired in deep corruption , with @entity50 - style oligarchs making enormous fortunes in shady deals -- such as those allegedly made ahead of the @entity158 -- while the economy fails to offer better prospects			1
@entity161 ranks @entity8 as one of the world 's most corrupt countries			1
next door in @entity166 , for example , which is now part of the @entity82 , per capita income has grown steadily , now topping $ 18,000 , up about 50 % in the last decade			0
@entity8 , meanwhile , has per capita gross domestic product of $ 6,300 , even lower than it was five years ago			2
perhaps nothing rankles @entity8 more than @entity26 's attitude toward their country			1
in 2008 , when then - president @entity173 tried to join @entity174 , @entity26 warned the @entity69 to keep its hands off @entity8 , calling it " @entity50 , " a term dating back to the days when @entity178 's czars ruled parts of @entity8			1
a @entity97 newspaper reported that @entity26 told then - @entity182 president @entity181 that " @entity8 is not even a state			1
" what started as protests over a trade deal has moved far beyond			0
demonstrations aim at ending the authoritarianism of the @entity66 regime , empowering parliament and laying the groundwork for political and economic progress			0
unfortunately , the protests have attracted a segment of thuggish extreme right - wing groups			0
estimates vary on their size and strength within the opposition			0
but their presence has given the regime and its @entity97 backers an excuse to label the protesters as fascists and neo-nazis			0
in predictable fashion , @entity50 has also blamed the @entity182 for the turmoil , accusing @entity212 of trying to impose the " western vector " of development and of telling " a sovereign state what they should do next			2
" the @entity182 is , in fact , expressing support for the protesters , but it is proposing a power - sharing government until the next elections			0
if anything , @entity212 and the @entity82 have failed to offer as much backing as they should			0
their disagreements have been aired publicly in embarrassing leaked recordings -- although they are not verified			0
their reluctance to challenge @entity26 's geopolitical claim to controlling @entity8 is a source of profound frustration for @entity8 who say they are being sacrificed to appease @entity26			1
opposition leaders have met with @entity69 officials to request more support			2
what is most striking about the protests has been their perseverance through the brutal @entity8 winter			0
three months into the crisis , with the intensity of the violence and the bloodshed increasing , @entity26 has reason to worry about how this will end			0
just as he wants the @entity158 to show what his @entity50 is capable of accomplishing , he knows the @entity97 people are keeping an eye on what exactly @entity8 protesters can achieve			1
the raging flames of @entity9 now matter more than the carefully tended fire in @entity6			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			0

@entity259 : new @entity50 on display in @entity6 , but the old one is showing its face in @entity8
@entity264 : @entity26 has called @entity8 " @entity50 " and wants it to turn away from the @entity69
@entity264 : protesters enraged by seeing their leaders ' *knuckle* under @entity50 's bullying
as demonstrators refuse to stop , she says , @entity26 should be worried they might prevail
