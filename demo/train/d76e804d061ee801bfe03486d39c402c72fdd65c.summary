@entity0 -- a group of @entity4 agents is going to court , saying new @entity6 administration directives on removing illegal immigrants could put them in violation of federal law			1
ten ice agents filed a lawsuit thursday in federal court in @entity13 against @entity15 secretary @entity14 and @entity4 director @entity16			2
the organization @entity17 , with it 's self - proclaimed stance of " for lower immigration , " quickly claimed a stake in the suit , saying on its website that it was " financing the effort " of the agents ' suit			2
@entity17 also emphasized on its site that @entity30 , the @entity32 @entity31 secretary of state who worked on @entity34 's controversial immigration law and is an informal adviser to presumed @entity32 presidential nominee @entity36 , is representing the suing agents			2
the suit cites @entity6 administration decisions to allow young people brought to the @entity40 before the age of 16 who meet certain criteria to apply for a two - year relief period in which they could n't be deported			1
the complaint also objects to the policy of " prosecutorial discretion , " in which @entity4 agents are supposed to focus their attention on dangerous criminals who are illegal immigrants			0
in a nutshell , the agents do not want to obey the new policies and do not want to face any disciplinary actions or lawsuits if they continue to arrest any type of immigrant who is in the @entity40 illegally			0
undocumented immigrants line up for relief from deportation " we are federal law enforcement officers who are being ordered to break the law			1
this directive puts @entity4 agents and officers in a horrible position , " @entity69 , one of the agents filing suit and the president of the @entity4 agents and oficers union , said , according to a news release posted on the @entity17 said			0
@entity75 , a spokesman for the @entity15 , responded , " @entity15 uses prosecutorial discretion to assist in focusing vigorously on the removal of individuals who are convicted criminals , repeat immigration law violators , and recent border - crossers			1
" @entity75 said the @entity83 decision is a temporary measure until @entity85 takes action on reforming immigration policies and that it " ensures that responsible young people , who are @entity40 in every way but on paper , have an opportunity to remain in the country and make their fullest contribution			2
" the @entity15 spokesman also said that in fiscal year 2011 @entity4 removed 216,000 criminal illegal immigrants , a figure @entity75 said is the largest in history and an 89 % increase over the administration of president @entity100			1
the @entity6 administration announced in june it will stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the @entity40 as children if they meet certain requirements			1
under the new policy , people younger than 30 who came to the @entity40 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military can get a two - year deferral from deportation , supporters stress it does not grant immunity or a provide a shortcut to citizenship but affords undocumented immigrant children a chance to be productive workers -- with a promise they wo n't be deported for two years			1
opponents see the policy as granting backdoor amnesty to people who came to @entity40 illegally and tightening an already poor job market for young @entity40			0
as many as 1.7 million youths may qualify for the program , according to the @entity130 , a project of the @entity130			0
the deferred deportation policy includes some of the provisions of a @entity135 proposal called the @entity136 that failed to win enough @entity32 support to become law			0
in this year 's presidential election , latino votes are critical in several battleground states , including @entity142 and @entity143			0
on thursday , several members of @entity85 came out in support of the @entity4 agents ' suit			0
sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , said the administration 's policies are " having a very negative effect on our immigration law enforcement officers ' ability to secure @entity40 's border and defend the rule of law			1
" undocumented students in their own words " ice agents should enforce our immigration laws and apprehend illegal immigrants , " said rep. @entity160 , @entity161 , the chairman of the @entity162			0
" but the @entity6 administration makes it impossible for @entity4 agents to do their jobs			1
" five things to know about the big change in immigration policy @entity173 blocks provisions in immigration laws , lets some controversial ones stand @entity1 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
