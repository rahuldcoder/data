-- the economic performance of @entity2 in the last few years has been remarkable			1
the continent has consistently defied the global trend			0
five years after the global financial system came perilously close to collapse , the global economic outlook is still uncertain			0
in @entity8 , gdp is still below pre-crisis levels and unemployment is at a record high			0
recovery in the @entity13 , although stronger , remains weak by historic standards , and even @entity15 , which has done so much to drive global growth , is slowing down			2
yet , in what some might call an unexpected twist , average growth in @entity2 over the last decade has been more than 5 %			1
of the 10 fastest - growing global economies , seven are in @entity2			2
but how will this economic spike be sustained ? how do we ensure we continue along this trajectory ? read more : @entity2 's giant infrastructure projects it is the world 's appetite for @entity2 's rich natural resources which , up to now , has been the major driver of this stellar record			1
and it is this same appetite that will provide both the opportunity and the solution for @entity2 to sustain these economic achievements			2
while not all @entity37 countries are commodity rich , the continent has 12 % of the world 's oil reserves , 40 % of its gold , and 80 % to 90 % of its chromium and platinum			1
@entity2 is also home to 60 % of the world 's underutilized arable land and has vast timber resources			1
the idea that these abundant natural resources can be the driver for an industrial revolution across the continent is growing			1
the latest edition of the @entity54 ( era 2013 ) sets out how the continent 's future will be determined by how policies that promote commodity - based industrialization are designed and implemented			1
we believe that such a transformation is both imperative and possible			0
but it requires courage , vision and a new mindset from the continent 's business and political leaders to overcome the challenges which continue to hold back the building of a successful and dynamic industrial base in @entity2			1
read more : @entity71 bids to be @entity2 's powerhouse there is no one - size - fits - all solution to accelerating resource - based industrialization			1
but important lessons can be learnt from the success of countries such as @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 in promoting value addition , new services , and technological capabilities			0
@entity80 , in particular , is a perfect example of how a commodity - based economy was transformed , through focused state interventions and an allocation of resources towards the industrial sector , to a high - income and diverse manufacturer in only a few decades			0
through a series of five - year development plans , centered on a vision to transform the structure of the economy and raise incomes in the medium - and long - term , investment was oriented towards industry			0
today , @entity80 is a key manufacturer and exporter of a wide range of goods and services			0
it is clear that governments , both individually and collectively , have an important role			0
a supportive policy and investment framework is essential to attract long - term investors			2
policies to build local capacity and address inequality are essential			2
moreover , developing skills through training and incentives will ensure that local economies are able to grow and diversify			0
@entity121 : new wind of change is blowing through @entity2 however , a barrier to @entity2 's industrialization that is not often talked about is the mindset of private sector leaders -- both in and outside @entity2			1
many are still indulging in the same historical rent - seeking attitudes that have resulted in the short - terms gains of crude , cocoa and gold sales			0
more business leaders need to change their thinking and understand that short - term revenue gains -- as opposed to long - term value addition -- offer little or no contribution to sustainable economic growth			1
we are now seeing a new style of african business leader emerging -- leaders who are building , investing , growing for @entity2 's future			1
it is their efforts which will provide the jobs and income which will have the biggest impact on tackling poverty and driving wider social progress			0
@entity2 's private sector must take the lead in improving coordination between farmers , growers , processors , and exporters ; in increasing competitiveness in the value chain , and ensuring the price , quality , and standards that market demands are met			1
read this : how @entity2 's natural resources can lift millions out of poverty we need to see national and regional champions created and supported , and help foster effective collaboration between public and private sector and the development world			1
this is the essence of the emerging economic philosophy called @entity175 , a private sector led partnership mode focused on @entity2 's development			1
we have already seen real progress on the continent			0
@entity71 's leather industry is not only developing fast but is also increasing high - value - added activities			2
@entity182 and @entity183 are making similar strides			0
in @entity188 and @entity189 , the cocoa and mining sectors have long contributed to wider socioeconomic growth			0
in @entity197 , the success of @entity193 's fresh vegetable producers in adding value to their exports has been remarkable			0
but when @entity2 only sees some 10 % of the income from its own coffee crop , we can see that much work still needs to be done			2
@entity2 now has the chance , as never before , to shape its own economic future through industrialization			1
this will help to spread prosperity throughout the continent			0
an industrialized @entity2 will also provide a much - needed new driver of global growth			1
it is in everyone 's interest that @entity2 succeeds			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 and @entity216 .			0

natural resources are driving rapid growth in many @entity37 countries
@entity223 resources can drive industry on the continent , say two experts
governments should tackle inequality and lay framework for supportive policies
new style of business leaders is emerging , building and investing in @entity2 's future
