@entity1 , @entity2 -- " today is a day of tears , " @entity0 said friday of a shipwreck off the tiny @entity2 island of @entity1 a day earlier , in which at least 111 people died			1
@entity2 's government declared friday a day of national mourning in the wake of the shipwreck			1
rescue efforts continued through the day , with divers at the site of the wreck , but rough waters complicated their task			2
four children were among the dead , alongside 49 women and 58 men , coast guard spokesman @entity17 said			0
another 155 people have been rescued : 145 men , six women and four children			2
there are fears the death toll could rise further since the boat , which capsized after catching fire just half a mile off the coast , may have been carrying as many as 500 migrants from @entity32			1
@entity2 authorities estimate that about 200 people are not accounted for			1
the @entity36 refugee agency said that all but one of the survivors were from @entity39 , in the @entity40			2
among those who escaped with their lives are 40 unaccompanied boys between ages 14 and 17 , said @entity47 , chief spokeswoman for the @entity36 refugee agency			0
she described the migrants as exhausted and in a state of shock			0
survivors recounted a harrowing tale of 13 days spent on the boat , which picked up its passengers from the @entity55 towns of @entity56 and @entity57 , to the west , @entity47 said			1
as they approached the coast of @entity1 , the engine stopped			1
the migrants hoped to be spotted , but , they told the @entity36 agency , fishing boats passed by without helping , so they set fire to clothes and blankets in a bid to attract attention			1
a tourist boat finally sounded the alert , and the coast guard came to their rescue , @entity47 said			2
@entity1 's boat people : one man 's story the survivors have been taken to a reception center that 's already overcrowded with about 1,000 other recent arrivals by boat , she said			1
@entity1 , south of @entity83 and the closest @entity2 island to @entity32 , has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter @entity88 countries			1
and such wrecks of migrant boats , although on a smaller scale , have become all too common			0
@entity0 , who gave his unscripted remarks while meeting with the poor on a visit to @entity95 , the birthplace of his namesake @entity98 , also railed thursday against what occurred in @entity1			1
labeling the tragedy a " disgrace , " he called for concerted action to ensure it is not repeated in future			0
he visited @entity1 in july to pray for refugees and migrants lost at sea and criticized then what he called " global indifference " to the island 's refugee crisis			1
' fundamentally wrong ' despite the dangers of taking to the sea in boats that are often barely seaworthy , thousands of migrants and asylum seekers depart @entity32 's shores every year in search of a better life			2
another 13 men drowned off @entity2 's southern coast monday when they attempted to swim ashore , the @entity36 refugee agency said thursday			1
and last week , the @entity2 coast guard rescued a ship bound for @entity1 from @entity42 that had 398 @entity126 refugees on board			1
@entity36 high commissioner for refugees @entity128 said the tragedy " should serve as a wake - up call " to the world			0
" there is something fundamentally wrong in a world where people in need of protection have to resort to these perilous journeys , " he said			2
he called for more effective international cooperation to crack down on people smugglers , saying the latest tragedy shows how vital it is for refugees " to have legal channels to access territories where they can find protection			2
" @entity148 , assistant professor of anthropology at the @entity150 , said it was time for @entity152 to enact new policies rather than simply shed tears for those who died -- or blame the traffickers			1
" to solve the problem , it is vital to understand what it is that routinely brings thousands of migrants to trust smugglers , face exorbitant costs and risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels , " he said			0
" it 's quite simple			0
it is legally impossible for them to travel safely on planes and ferries			0
" this can be because their oppressive home countries wo n't grant them exit visas or because they 're poor and ca n't offer the financial guarantees needed for a @entity152 visa to be granted , he said			0
" but they risk the many dangers to escape despair , " he said			0
" they fall through the immense cracks of a system that needs them for a job or might grant them asylum , but only if they first make it through miles of peril and years of exploitation			0
" rights group @entity194 said in its @entity195 2013 that " ongoing serious human rights abuses , forced labor and indefinite military service prompt thousands of @entity39 to flee the country every year			0
" no election has been held since it gained independence in 1993 , the rights group said			0
meanwhile , torture , arbitrary detention and severe restrictions on people 's freedoms " remain routine in @entity39			1
" overcrowded boats just under 115 kilometers ( 70 miles ) from @entity42 , @entity1 has been the first point of entry to @entity152 for more than 200,000 refugees and irregular migrants who have passed through the island since 1999			1
but boats carrying migrants often are in peril at sea			0
in recent years , the @entity2 coast guard says , it has been involved in the rescue of more than 30,000 refugees around the island			1
@entity222 , a spokeswoman for the @entity88 's border agency , @entity224 , said migrants are often sent to sea in overcrowded vessels without the engine power to make such a long and dangerous journey			1
since the start of the year , @entity224 -- which supports the efforts of individual @entity88 member states -- has helped save more than 16,000 lives in search - and - rescue operations , she said			0
" @entity2 is currently facing the biggest migratory pressure of all @entity152 countries , " she said , adding that more than 31,500 have reached its shores since the beginning of the year			1
the migrants mainly set off from @entity55 , but others also leave from @entity242 , she said			0
" we see an increasing amount of @entity39 , @entity244 , to a lesser extent @entity246 , and an increasing number of @entity126 nationals			0
" while @entity2 is the current focus of efforts by migrants and asylum - seekers hoping to enter the @entity88 , @entity249 said , that has not always been the case			2
" seven years ago , it was the @entity258 , then the pressure moved to the central @entity260 , then it moved to @entity261 , then with the @entity262 , it moved back to @entity2 , " she said			2
" there are definitely too many lives lost and definitely too many tragedies in the @entity260			0
" dead or missing at sea rights group @entity268 called for both @entity2 and the @entity88 to do more to safeguard the thousands who risk their lives each year in the hope of protection or a better life , rather than focusing on closing off the borders			2
more than 100 missing after illegal migrant boat sinks off @entity277 according to a briefing published by the @entity36 refugee agency in july , the peak crossing period for migrants and asylum - seekers runs from may to september			0
the @entity36 refugee agency recorded 40 deaths in the first six months of 2013 , a figure based on interviews with survivors of the crossing			0
for 2012 as a whole , 15,000 migrants and asylum - seekers reached @entity2 and @entity292 , and almost 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea , it said			1
the @entity36 agency credits the efforts of the @entity2 coast guard and @entity292 armed forces for a reduction in migrant deaths in the first half of 2013 compared with the previous year			2
risk for a better life ends in death for 22 people near @entity306 @entity3 's @entity307 reported from @entity1 and @entity308 from @entity309 , while @entity310 wrote in @entity311			1
@entity3 's @entity312 and @entity313 contributed to this report .			0
