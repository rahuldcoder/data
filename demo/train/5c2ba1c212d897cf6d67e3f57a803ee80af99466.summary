-- @entity1 had n't worked out a day in her life			1
she never watched what she ate , either			0
but after having her first son , @entity4 , in december 2009 , she could n't seem to shake the baby weight			1
@entity6 had gained more than 100 pounds during the pregnancy , reaching 230 pounds at 5 feet 6 inches tall			1
she hid under sweatpants , sweaters and athletic gear			0
" i was embarrassed to even go to the gym , " says @entity6 , 33			1
" i was so incredibly out of shape , and the people i was working out beside were so incredibly fit			1
i felt like a real eyesore when i would walk down the street			0
" despite her best efforts to drop the extra weight , she had only managed to lose 10 pounds by the following may			1
" i just felt really down on myself , " @entity6 says			1
" i felt like there was so much more i was capable of , and i did n't want to be one of those women who just accept their weight and that that 's their fate as a young mom			1
i felt like there was a better me			0
" frustrated , @entity6 remembered hearing about a new gym called @entity28 near her home in @entity31 , @entity32			1
core concepts owner @entity33 says the idea behind his workouts is that your core -- made up of your abs , obliques , back and glutes -- is your origin of movement			1
a strong core improves posture and balance and decreases risk of injury			2
@entity33 's workouts consist of body weight exercises , including beggar 's planks , split and bicycle crunches , back extensions and wide - stance plie squats			2
the core is a major " problem area " for many people , @entity33 says			2
it 's the spot men and women tend to notice extra pounds first			2
but because the core includes several large muscles , working it burns calories fast			1
as such , attacking the core can lead to quick weight loss results , @entity33 says			1
after researching @entity33 's concept , @entity6 decided to walk in and introduce herself			1
that day , she signed up for classes and started to shed the extra pounds			0
@entity33 had @entity6 visualize in front of the mirror , and she began to see the body she wanted			1
she says that built the motivation she needed to meet her weight loss goals			0
" we envisioned what my waist , stomach and arms were going to look like , and we just stayed on that path until we were happy with the result , " @entity6 says			2
" @entity85 never let me lose sight of how to get there			0
" @entity6 describes @entity33 's concept as unconventional			2
" it 's not a spin class , it 's not a running class , it 's not a @entity94 class , " she says			0
" he took my fitness to a completely different level , and he really challenged me			0
" @entity33 and @entity6 both emphasize that to see results , you have to change your whole lifestyle			2
" if you think the hour that you go to the gym is what counts , it 's really not , " @entity33 said			0
" it 's doing other things -- going for a walk with your dog , not hopping on the escalator at the mall -- there 's all these little things			0
" upwave : try it now ! one - minute workout challenge after about eight months of eating clean -- increasing fruit and vegetable intake while decreasing meat consumption -- and attending core and plyometric classes for an hour a day , six days a week , @entity6 lost 106 pounds , which was even more than she had gained while pregnant			1
but shortly after reaching her goal weight , @entity6 went " from one extreme to another			1
" she got pregnant with twins			2
this time , however , she was determined to stay on track			0
she continued to work out until @entity127 and @entity128 , now 18 months old , were born			0
@entity6 gained just 48 pounds during her second pregnancy			1
she lost 38 of those pounds within two weeks after giving birth and the last 10 pounds by the end of the year			0
" the last 10 pounds were hard , like they usually are for people , but she stuck with it and refused to fail , " @entity33 says			0
aside from feeling physically better than ever , @entity6 also feels less shy and does n't avoid going out anymore			2
she put in the time and effort , and her body responded			0
" it was amazing to watch myself accomplish that because the amount of determination it takes to get to that level really is mental just as much as it is physical , " @entity6 says			2
" there 's a lot of mental grit you need to have			0
" having three children poses a challenge for keeping the weight off , but @entity6 says the time put in is worth it			1
" it 's one hour a day that i can take to do something good for me , " she says			0
" i come back to my family reinvigorated and ready for whatever challenges in life lie my way			0
" with less free time to attend classes at set times , @entity6 has kept up through @entity33 's mobile app , @entity164 , which launched last november			1
the flexibility of the app has allowed @entity6 to stay committed to her exercise plan even with three children and a busy schedule after returning to work			1
while she tries to fit in cardio using a jogging stroller , the app allows her to keep her workouts well - rounded			2
now a size 4 and down to 120 pounds , @entity6 hopes to inspire other mothers trying to stay healthy through multiple pregnancies			1
" i feel very , very lucky that i 've been able to go through this transformation , " she says			0
" i would n't change anything -- not even the part about being overweight and going through that -- because it got me to where i am today			0
i really am my best self			0
