a gruesome snuff video that has garnered more than 180,000 views on @entity2 underlines just how grim the @entity4 conflict has become			1
this video appears to document one of the worst kinds of war crimes : the summary executions of wounded men			1
( warning : the scenes are extremely graphic			0
) several paramilitaries in battle fatigues armed with automatic weapons -- some speaking @entity16 in distinctive @entity18 accents -- pull wounded men out of the back of a van and drop them on to the ground , then shoot them in their heads at point - blank range			0
as they shoot their victims , some of the paramilitaries seem almost giddy with excitement			0
a man who appears to be their commander admonishes his men , " come on guys , we are here to carry out our duties not to seek revenge on our own			0
" one of the paramilitaries smilingly replies , " but we are killing them in @entity38 's cause , only in @entity38 's cause			2
" the wounded men lying on the ground awaiting their deaths repeat religious phrases that are commonly said just before death			0
they all appear to be civilians			0
there has been much analysis of the @entity49 - aligned groups in @entity4 fighting the @entity51 regime that have recruited thousands of foreign fighters from around the @entity54 world and a smaller number from the @entity56 , but there has been far less discussion of the @entity60 militias in @entity4 that have recruited foreign fighters from @entity62 as well as from @entity18 @entity63 , all of whom are fighting to support @entity4 president @entity51			1
@entity66 , an @entity67 journalist who is a fellow at the @entity68 and who has reported inside @entity4 for many months , says that one of the executioners in the videotape is wearing a distinctive yellow armband that @entity63 fighters wear			1
@entity66 says , " this appears to be a @entity63 video , though we can not conclude this with high confidence			2
" similarly , @entity80 , professor of international relations at @entity82 and the author of an authoritative study of @entity63 , says , " the only identifying marks on the uniforms are yellow ribbons , which , in theory , would identify them as @entity90			0
" @entity91 , also a fellow at the @entity68 and a scholar at the @entity93 who is writing a book about @entity63 , says that based on the accents of the @entity16 - speaking executioners the video shows @entity4 as well as fighters from @entity62 and @entity18			1
slim cautions , however , that the paramilitaries conducting the executions could well be members of an @entity104 militia made up mostly of @entity4 who have been trained by @entity63 , but that are not part of @entity63 itself			1
@entity107 , a researcher at the @entity108 who specializes in @entity60 militias operating in @entity4 , says that the fighters are likely from @entity63 as they speak in a @entity18 accent and when they perform the executions they mention a religious edict handed down by a key @entity63 religious guide			1
@entity114 is a @entity115 who worked at the @entity117 for much of the past decade as a @entity119 analyst , including a stint on general @entity122 ' staff during the @entity123 , and is now a vice president at the @entity125 , which supports " moderate elements of @entity4 's armed opposition			1
" @entity114 has been tracking @entity63 since 2007 and he asserts that the executioners in the video are definitely from @entity63 and that the video itself was shot in @entity132 province in western @entity4			1
an analysis done by @entity135 's international desk confirms that the dialect spoken by the executioners in the videotape is @entity139 and they can be heard shouting " @entity141 , " an @entity16 phrase that means " in @entity38 's cause , " an expression commonly used by @entity63 fighters on the battlefield			2
the international desk 's analysis points out that the yellow and green ribbons tied to the fighters ' uniforms appear to mark them as @entity63 fighters			0
as is now well known , many of the players in the @entity4 conflict , including most prominently the @entity51 regime itself , have committed war crimes against civilians			2
on friday , @entity161 released a report documenting a massacre on august 4 that was perpetrated by two @entity49 - aligned @entity165 militant groups , the @entity164 and @entity166			1
the massacre took place in the coastal region of @entity170 in a number of @entity104 villages supportive of the @entity51 regime			0
according to the report " eight survivors and witnesses described how opposition forces executed residents and opened fire on civilians , sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack , and at other times killing adult male family members , and holding the female relatives and children hostage			0
" @entity161 collected the names of 190 civilians who were killed in these attacks , including 57 women and at least 18 children and 14 elderly men			2
while the world in the past few weeks has been distracted by the @entity67 government shutdown and the brutal attack on the mall in @entity198 by an @entity49 affiliate that left at least 67 dead , the @entity4 war has ground on			1
it is a war that has now claimed as many as 120,000 lives			0
four of those deaths are documented in the appalling videotape of the @entity60 paramilitaries gleefully executing wounded men who appear to be civilians			0
and the deaths of 190 civilians killed by @entity165 militias in august are documented in great detail in the @entity161 report that was released friday			1
just when you thought the @entity4 civil war could n't get any worse , it does .			2

a video *purportedly* shot in @entity4 shows gruesome executions
@entity219 : *atrocities* in @entity4 *continue* , and appear to *involve* both sides
he cites a @entity161 report documenting a massacre on aug. 4
@entity227 : as the world 's attention wanders , as many as 120,000 have died in @entity4
