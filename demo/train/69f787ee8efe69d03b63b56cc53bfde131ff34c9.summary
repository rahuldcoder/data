-- sitting on the beach enjoying the final day of a perfect vacation with loved ones this week , i marveled at how beautiful life is			0
the fog rolling off the ocean a sight to cleanse the soul			0
then i sat down to read the @entity10 on the @entity12 abuse cover - up , and i felt filthy			1
pulled back into reality , i was reminded how ugly and cruel the world can be , especially when people we entrust to lead and protect our children fail us			2
the 267 - page report that cites 430 interviews and 3.5 million pieces of e-mail and electronic data tells a story of failure at every level of the university to expose a known child predator			0
it is enough to make even the most vigilant among us question our faith in humanity			0
and right off , it implicates those most to blame : " four of the most powerful people at the @entity12 -- president @entity35 , senior vice president - finance and business @entity36 , athletic director @entity38 and head football coach @entity39 -- failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade			1
" news : more storms looming for @entity12 in wake of @entity47 report @entity39 and his cohorts failed us all			1
they let the big money , fame and glory of college sports make them forget to be coaches and mentors , to turn a blind eye to a horror in their midst			1
they forgot to be decent men			0
instead , they thought they were gods			0
gods with the power to decide which lives mattered and which could be thrown away			0
last month , their former employee @entity68 , once @entity12 's assistant football coach , was convicted of sexually assaulting 10 boys over many years			1
somehow these @entity12 gods had all concluded that the abused boys were worthless , underprivileged children who were nothing compared to the mighty @entity73			1
is there really any greater power in @entity78 culture than the @entity79 ? even now , after all the negative stories surrounding the games , we want to believe -- i want to believe - that in the end sports is one of the best things about our country			0
as a proud alumna of @entity12 , former cheerleader and former @entity39 fan , i admit that i was hoping that at least @entity39 would turn out to be the good guy in this horrendous story			1
that somehow he was working internally to help stop those boys from being abused and did more than just report an " incident to his bosses			0
" but that is not the case , according to all the evidence			0
even his last public words tell us he finally grasped this : " it 's one of the great sorrows of my life ... in hindsight i wish i had done more			0
" how exactly does one go to sleep at night having stood by and allowed children to be raped and abused ? do you tell yourself that 1,000 good deeds will erase the pain you 've allowed to happen ? and how can we make @entity39 's last words more than just regrets ? certainly the @entity68 conviction and the @entity47 report are a good start			1
but there 's more we can do			0
it 's time for the state of @entity120 and other authorities to take a long look at the @entity124 program , its board and all its staff , including @entity68 's wife			1
after all the covering up around this case , it is not unreasonable to think @entity68 's pedophile playground extended well beyond the walls of @entity12			1
@entity47 's report already leads us down this path , detailing the questionable ties between @entity124 and @entity12 , pointing to a land deal between the university and the nonprofit , an " unusual " $ 168,000 payment to @entity68 when he was allowed to retire in 1999 and an agreement to let @entity68 's program hold youth camps and other events on the @entity12 campus			1
these were just a few of the activities that went on after @entity68 was first investigated in 1998 when a mother reported that @entity68 had showered with and groped her 11 - year - old boy on @entity12 's campus			1
@entity150 , it turned out , were a " regular occurrence " at the @entity12 facility much earlier than 1998 , according to @entity47 's report			1
but when staffers were asked why nothing ever was reported , everyone said they either did n't think anything was improper about a grown man showering with boys or they feared losing their jobs			0
news : @entity12 review recasts story of @entity163 hero @entity39 some may say that i 'm being overzealous in calling for more investigations ; that i 'm piling on			1
if @entity68 's victims and their parents found the courage to come forward and face their abuser and an entire university , then i think authorities are obligated to ensure that the @entity173 is cleaned up and that it is safe for children			0
( in may , the @entity124 sought court approval to close and transfer its assets to a @entity179 - based ministry ; the request is pending , ) if that means finding more boys who were abuse victims of @entity68 or any other staffers there , then that must be done			2
the cover - up must end			0
the families who seek support from the @entity124 program deserve justice			2
@entity39 , @entity35 , @entity192 and @entity38 were all family men			1
@entity39 alone has five children and 17 great - grandchildren			2
i 'm sure these men worked hard and made many sacrifices to give their children every chance to succeed			0
so did the hard - working parents who sent their kids off to participate in the @entity124 program			1
they , too , were hoping to provide a better life for their kids , one that may have been beyond their means to reach alone			0
so they trusted others -- @entity68 , @entity124 and the @entity12 family -- to help shape their children into better citizens and leaders			1
certainly , those parents did n't believe the lives of their kids were any less precious than @entity39 's			1
no one told them that " @entity219 " were expendable			0
and that even on the hallowed @entity12 campus , they were in grave danger			2
but that 's exactly what this sad story tells us now			0
those of us in the @entity12 family need to stop making excuses for what happened			1
we should be demanding that any and all association with @entity124 program be severed until there is a full investigation of that program and everyone associated with it			2
the abuse victims certainly deserve this much and so does the @entity12			2
news : @entity12 leaders ' empowered @entity68 ' " ... in hindsight , i wish i had done more			2
" let 's not have to echo those words ever again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity248 .			2

@entity248 : @entity12 report implicates four powerful men who failed to protect kids
she says they *worried* about money , fame , glory , turned blind eye to childrens ' victimization
she says @entity39 *guilty* like rest ; now @entity124 organization should be investigated
@entity266 : no more excuses ; we must discover whether @entity124 involved , other kids hurt
