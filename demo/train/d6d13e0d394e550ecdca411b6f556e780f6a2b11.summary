-- @entity1 has at times made his domination of @entity4 look effortless , but the triple world champion insists his supremacy is the result of tireless work from his all - conquering @entity10 team			1
the @entity11 has taken the checkered flag at each of the last three grands prix , extending his lead at the top of the drivers ' championship to 60 points with just six races of the 2013 season remaining			1
with a fourth consecutive world title all but in the bag , @entity1 has paid tribute to the team which have powered his @entity27 car to the front of the grid			1
" i have very little information about what others are doing , but i can say that we 're one of the hardest working teams and thus deserve to be where we are right now , " the 26 - year - old told @entity4 's official website			1
" this is not only a question of quantity -- how many more hours you put in -- but very much about quality			2
" @entity1 's occupation of the podium has led to a backlash from some fans , with the former @entity47 driver consistently booed by fans during the season			1
he was most recently jeered after winning the @entity50			2
@entity1 is unmoved by the negativity , putting it down to fans who are disappointed with him consistently finishing ahead of their favorite drivers			1
" i am relaxed about it , " he said			2
" i think the media exaggerate this matter			2
it is not that hordes of people boo -- it is only a small percentage			0
" and is n't it so that every fan has the right to cheer for his own team and show disappointment when the others win ? i think those who booed were @entity69 fans who obviously were disappointed that we again finished ahead of them			1
" no big deal for us			0
the thing that matters is to know that we again did everything right -- that you can be satisfied with your performance			0
" @entity1 's nearest rival @entity78 , who drives for @entity69 , has n't given up hope of clinching his third world championship going into this weekend 's @entity82			1
and the @entity83 is urging his team to take heart from @entity87 's incredible comeback recently against @entity88 in sailing 's @entity89			2
the @entity91 trailed 8 - 1 before roaring back to retain the @entity89 trophy			0
" the president ( @entity95 ) and me think anything can happen , " @entity78 told @entity93			0
" like the @entity89 , we saw the @entity91 team was 1 - 8 down and they won 9 - 8			0
" we know it would be difficult , but if you have two lucky races , things can change very quickly			0
but we need a lot of luck ; we know that			0
" we need to be realistic because we do n't have the pace to beat them in normal conditions , so we need luck in all six races			0
" if we have luck , everybody can be sure that we will be there to take [ advantage ]			0
we will not give up until it 's mathematically impossible			1
