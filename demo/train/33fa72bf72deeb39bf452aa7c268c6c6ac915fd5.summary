-- most @entity1 had never heard of the @entity2 until this week , when president @entity3 announced that @entity1 airstrikes in @entity5 had targeted the " seasoned @entity7 operatives			2
" @entity1 officials said that the @entity2 group was actively plotting to conduct an attack in the @entity1 or @entity11			2
" we ca n't say that we definitely disrupted their plots " against the @entity16 with the @entity1 airstrikes , a senior @entity3 administration official told one of us , but " there is a decent chance we have " because " their communications are interrupted " and members of the group were killed in the strikes			1
the sudden public emergence of the @entity2 as a threat underlines the fact that the global jihadist movement , which at the time of the 9/11 attacks was largely concentrated in @entity30 , has morphed and metastasized a great deal since then			2
which raises the question : what are the dimensions of the overall global jihadist threat today ? during the @entity38 the @entity1 intelligence community knew in detail the size of the @entity42 military and the disposition of its forces across @entity11 and @entity45			1
in the long , twilight struggle against @entity7 , its affiliates , splinter groups , and like - minded organizations -- armed forces that fight without uniforms and often in secret -- such an accounting is harder to do			1
a good example of this is the shifting estimates of @entity58 's strength			2
@entity58 , which split off from @entity7 earlier this year , " can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across @entity62 and @entity5 , " a @entity60 spokesman told @entity0 last week			1
this is as much as three times previous estimate of @entity58 's strength ; @entity1 officials initially estimated @entity58 had around 10,000 fighters			2
to see if we could come up with some kind of estimate for the total number of militants fighting with jihadist groups around the world , we asked a range of experts to estimate the number of fighters belonging to various @entity7 - affiliated or like - minded groups			1
these estimates appear in a report , which we helped to author , that was released this week by the @entity81 's @entity80 , a successor to the @entity83			1
if we tally up the low and high estimates for all these groups , we can begin to have a sense of the total number of jihadist militants that are part of formal organizations around the globe			1
we found that on the low end , an estimated 85,000 men are fighting in jihadist groups around the world ; on the high end , 106,000			1
how did we arrive at those numbers ? -- we assess that core @entity7 , whose members are largely located in the @entity101 tribal regions along the @entity101 - @entity30 border , has been devastated in recent years by @entity60 drone strikes and now numbers only in the low hundreds of militants			2
-- @entity106 ( @entity106 ) , which operates out of @entity107 , poses perhaps the most immediate threat to the @entity1 homeland			2
@entity106 had 300 original members in 2010 , expanding to around 1,000 by 2012 , and membership has remained steady since then , according to @entity112 , whose book " the last refuge : @entity107 , @entity7 , and @entity115 in @entity116 , " is the authoritative history of @entity106			2
-- @entity117 , the @entity7 affiliate operating in @entity5 and northern @entity62 , is estimated to be smaller than @entity58 , with which it is presently at war			0
@entity120 , who tracks @entity121 for the @entity122 , estimates that @entity121 has 5,000 to 10,000 fighters			0
( the @entity2 group is only a small subset of @entity121 )			0
-- @entity126 , @entity7 's @entity127 affiliate , once controlled much of that country , but it has suffered a number of battlefield losses over the past three years			0
@entity131 , a professor of political science at @entity133 and a specialist on @entity127 , believes that the most reliable estimates for the group put the number of fighters between 3,000 and 5,000			0
-- @entity140 military intervention in @entity141 in 2013 largely defeated the forces of @entity143 ( @entity143 ) and its splinter groups , which had taken over half of the country , but @entity143 countinues to operate in @entity148 , @entity141 , @entity149 and @entity150			1
@entity143 's main appeal is its wealth , as its focus on kidnappings for ransom has brought in an estimated $ 90 million			1
@entity156 , who studies @entity158 militant groups for @entity160 's @entity159 , estimates the total number of @entity143 - associated fighters in the @entity164 region of @entity158 at about 3,000			1
-- counterterrorism operations in 2009 and 2010 have reduced @entity166 ( @entity166 ) , @entity7 's @entity167 affiliate			0
in the period after 2010 , " @entity166 was severely crippled and could only stage small - scale attacks " according to @entity169 , a leading @entity166 expert at the @entity170			0
the @entity1 @entity172 ( @entity173 ) assesses : " @entity167 governments since 2002 have arrested more than 300 suspected terrorists , significantly degrading @entity166 's network			0
" about 100 @entity167 have reportedly traveled to fight with @entity58 , which could reinvigorate @entity167 extremist networks			1
the threat to @entity181 interests , of course , does n't just come from those groups that are formally affiliated with @entity7			1
-- though the @entity101 @entity184 is predominantly focused on fighting in @entity101 , the group has repeatedly threatened the @entity1			2
the group was responsible for @entity187 's failed car bomb attack in @entity188 on may 1 , 2010			0
according to @entity170 professor @entity189 , who has written extensively on the @entity184 , the @entity101 @entity184 have anywhere from 17,000 to 22,000 foot soldiers			0
-- the influx of @entity101 @entity184 militants into @entity30 -- under the leadership of @entity101 @entity184 commander @entity195 , who currently resides in @entity30 -- adds more fighters to an already robust @entity184 force : @entity1 government officials estimate the number of @entity30 @entity184 members at around 35,000			0
-- since 2011 , the @entity201 ( @entity201 ) has lost several senior leaders , yet the group continues to pose a threat to @entity30 and @entity101			0
the @entity201 claimed responsibility for the june 2014 attack on @entity208 's @entity207 , which killed 28 people			0
the @entity210 estimated that as of april 2014 , the @entity201 had about 200 to 300 members and that its splinter , the @entity213 , has 100 to 200 members			0
-- since its creation in 2002 , @entity215 has only attacked @entity181 interests once , when it bombed the @entity219 office in @entity220 , @entity221 , in august 2011			0
the group has consistently shown little inclination for attacking @entity181 targets and is principally interested in putting @entity221 under its version of @entity227 law			0
dr. @entity228 , the director of @entity229 at @entity230 has estimated that @entity215 had several thousand supporters and at least 300 armed men			0
( we excluded from our overall account the armed forces of @entity236 and @entity237 , because these organizations also engage in conventional politics and governing and also do not attack @entity1 targets -- all facts that make them at odds with @entity7 and its affiliates and splinter groups )			1
the vast majority of the estimated 85,000 to 106,000 militants fighting with militant jihadist groups around the world are fighting for purely local reasons , for instance , trying to install @entity227 law in northern @entity221 or trying to impose @entity184 rule on @entity101 and @entity30 , while only a small number of these militants are focused on attacking the @entity16			1
by historical standards this is hardly a major threat			0
at the end of the @entity38 , @entity42 and other @entity259 countries could muster around 6 million men to fight in a war against the @entity16 , a number that is some 60 times greater than the total number of militants estimated to be fighting for jihadist organizations today			1
and , of course , the @entity42 had a vast supply of nuclear - armed , land - based missiles , nuclear - armed submarines and nuclear - armed bombers and many other highly sophisticated weapons systems that jihadist organizations have never acquired and are quite unlikely to			1
the only reasonable conclusion to draw is that the threat posed by jihadist organizations around the globe is quite inconsequential when compared with what the @entity16 faced in the past century .			1

@entity279 , @entity280 : @entity281 shows jihad groups metastasizing . but growing ?
they say new report they try to count these forces that fight without uniforms , often in secret
they say between 85,000 and 106,000 militant jihadists fighting worldwide
writers : to compare , in @entity38 @entity42 could muster around 6 million to fight the @entity16
