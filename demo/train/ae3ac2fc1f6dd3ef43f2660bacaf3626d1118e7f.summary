-- as @entity3 's delirious fans spilled onto the pitch to revel in their team 's remarkable @entity6 title win on sunday , the celebrations also kicked off thousands of miles away in @entity8			1
in one cafe in the @entity12 capital , some fans stood and danced , one even leaped onto a table , while others simply smiled contentedly as they puffed on their shisha pipes			0
@entity3 's dramatic 3 - 2 win over @entity17 was beamed to an estimated global audience of 4.7 billion in a powerful advert for just why @entity20 bin zayed bin sultan @entity20 splashed out $ 320 million to buy the @entity22 club in 2008			1
the title was won at the @entity24			0
the players wore shirts emblazoned with the @entity28 logo -- the @entity8 - based airline			2
the title - clinching goal was scored by record $ 62 million signing @entity31 in the dying seconds of the game			2
it was , in short , the brightest indicator yet of the @entity35 's growing influence within @entity37 football			1
" for a lot of the people here , they say that they did n't even follow the @entity22 until @entity3 was bought by the @entity8 group , " reported @entity0 's @entity38 in @entity8 , " so you can imagine they 've been extremely happy with the results the entire year			1
" it elevates the country 's emergence as a major sporting power			0
" owner @entity20 , a member of the country 's ruling family , was n't at the stadium on sunday -- he has been to only one match at the @entity28 -- and has n't yet commented on the club 's first title win in 44 years			1
but it was @entity20 who invested more than $ 600 million on players like @entity31 , @entity60 and @entity61 , and helped the perennial underachievers beat neighbors @entity64 to the title on goal difference			1
the incredible images on sunday delivered the message on his behalf			0
@entity28 , which carried a message of congratulations to @entity3 on its website on monday , reportedly paid more than $ 600 million for stadium naming rights and shirt sponsorship over 10 years , but the benefits are huge			1
" when you win national and international titles , the exposure to a very , very relevant target audience for us could n't be better , " @entity77 , chief commercial officer of the airline , told @entity0			0
while so many @entity37 countries are in financial difficulties , it is n't just @entity8 taking advantage of football 's global appeal			1
@entity91 airline @entity12 has a high - profile stadium and shirt sponsorship deal with @entity94 , and the @entity91 - based royal @entity95 took over @entity98 club @entity97 last year			2
@entity97 managed an 11th - place finish in @entity100 , seven places behind the league 's other @entity35 - owned club , @entity102			0
@entity104 , a member of the @entity106 royal family , bought out @entity102 in 2010 when the modest club had never finished higher than seventh in the top flight			1
veteran @entity111 striker @entity110 helped the club to a fourth - place finish this season and a place in the @entity117 qualifiers			0
emboldened by the country 's shock winning bid to host the @entity121 , @entity106 has since worked on spreading its influence across @entity37			1
@entity124 ( @entity125 ) reportedly paid $ 220 million over five years to put the @entity127 name on @entity129 's shirt , but it is in @entity131 where the tiny natural gas - rich nation is really making its presence felt			1
@entity125 took over @entity135 last summer , hoping not just to awake a sleeping giant of the @entity131 game but to create a new @entity37 powerhouse			0
" this is our strategy to bring @entity135 on long term to be one of the biggest in the world , " club president @entity139 told @entity0 in march			0
to that end , @entity135 brought @entity147 @entity146 on board as sporting director , paid a @entity131 record $ 56 million to sign @entity151 and hired @entity152 as coach			2
@entity135 might miss out on the league title -- trailing @entity155 by three points with one game remaining -- but the potentially exciting end to the season at least justifies @entity161 's investment in the @entity163 domestic television rights at a reported â ‚ ¬ 510 million a year until 2016			2
@entity161 also has the international rights to the league , as well as most of the @entity117 rights in @entity131 from 2012 , and there are even suggestions that the broadcaster could make a bid for the @entity172 rights for the @entity22			0
it is all designed to establish @entity106 as a global sporting power , which the country hopes will be confirmed in 2022 when it hosts the biggest single - event sporting competition in the world			0
the growing appeal of @entity106 's domestic league has also been highlighted in recent times , with former @entity100 and @entity184 striker @entity183 swapping @entity187 @entity186 side @entity185 for @entity188 in the @entity189			2
for now , though , it is @entity8 in the spotlight as it joins the blue half of the city of @entity194 in joyous celebration .			0

@entity3 's title win celebrated in @entity8 , home of the club 's owners
club was brought out by member of @entity8 royal family in *september* 2008
@entity20 has spent estimated $ 600 million on players alone since then
@entity106 and @entity91 also making their presence felt in @entity37 football
