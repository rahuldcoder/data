@entity0 -- gen. @entity3 , the former leader of coalition forces in @entity5 who was nominated to become supreme allied commander of @entity8 , is retiring instead of continuing to pursue the post , president @entity2 announced tuesday			1
@entity3 informed @entity2 that he will leave the service rather than move forward with the nomination , which requires @entity15 confirmation , a @entity11 statement said			2
" i met with general @entity3 and accepted his request to retire from the military so that he can address health issues within his family , " @entity2 said			1
in a statement later tuesday , @entity3 said his reasons for retiring were personal			1
" while i wo n't go into the details , my primary concern is for the health of my wife , who has sacrificed so much for so long			1
for more than 35 years , my beloved @entity26 has devotedly stood beside me and enabled me to serve my country			0
" it is profoundly sobering to consider how much of that time i have spent away from her and our two precious daughters			0
it is now my turn to stand beside them , to be there for them when they need me most , " he said			0
@entity3 , a @entity39 general , was the top coalition commander in @entity5 for nearly two years			1
he relinquished that command earlier this month after planning the end of the mission 's combat operations			0
however , @entity3 was caught up in a scandal over embarrassing e-mails with @entity47 socialite @entity46 that came to the public 's attention during the same investigation that brought down former cia director @entity51			1
@entity1 previously reported that @entity53 officials said there was inappropriate language in those e-mails , but no evidence of an affair between @entity3 and @entity46			2
@entity3 's nomination for the @entity8 commander post was put on hold while the @entity53 's inspector general looked into the issue			1
he was cleared of wrongdoing after several months and the @entity11 initially indicated @entity2 would proceed with the nomination			2
on tuesday , @entity2 called the general one of @entity68 's finest military leaders			0
@entity3 " presided over the significant growth in the size and capability of @entity73 , the further degradation of @entity75 and their extremist allies , and the ongoing transition to @entity5 security responsibility across the country , " @entity2 said in the statement			1
defense secretary @entity80 said in a statement on tuesday that @entity3 's leadership in @entity5 " will be long remembered as pivotal " to the mission			1
" the strategy he developed and implemented has put us on the right path towards completing this mission , with @entity5 forces now on track to step into the lead for security nationwide this spring and to assume full security responsibility by the end of next year , " @entity80 said			2
@entity80 , who also is stepping down , previously acknowledged that @entity3 has " been under a tremendous amount of pressure , " and advised him to take his time in deciding whether to continue pursuing the @entity8 commander position			1
in july 2011 , @entity3 succeeded @entity51 to inherit the largest - ever @entity8 force in @entity5 and spent 19 months directing his forces against @entity101 insurgents and preparing for the first phases of a hand - over of provincial security to local and national forces			1
about 150,000 @entity107 members were deployed at that time , including just under 100,000 @entity68 troops			0
there are 66,000 @entity68 service members currently deployed to the region , and @entity2 announced last week his intention to bring home 34,000 of them within a year			0
less than a month after he assumed command , the @entity68 suffered its deadliest single attack of the @entity5 war when insurgents downed a @entity119 helicopter in @entity121 province , killing 30 @entity68 service members			0
the toll included 22 @entity124			0
@entity3 later faced additional diplomatic crises that followed controversial incidents that included the accidental burning of @entity128 by @entity68 service members , @entity68 airstrikes that resulted in civilian deaths and the killing of 16 civilians in a massacre allegedly carried out by a @entity68 service member			0
an uptick in " green - on - blue " attacks -- in which @entity5 forces or trainees turn their weapons against @entity68 counterparts -- is also believed to have hampered the training of @entity5 forces and contributed to increased public discontent at home over @entity68 deployment to the region			0
a graduate of @entity149 and the @entity150 , @entity3 also drew distinction for his counterinsurgency work in @entity153 , particularly in the country 's volatile @entity155 province in 2008 , where he helped isolate a growing insurgency			2
@entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
