-- @entity3 's latest defense of the mental distraction it creates for its users ? it 's not a bug , it 's a feature ! at least that 's the meaning i take from a web commercial for the new smartphone start screen , @entity12 , in which founder @entity14 's announcement of the portal 's launch is disrupted and interrupted by a host of @entity3 updates			1
" after all your hard work , " he says to a group of employees in their work space , " @entity12 is ready to ship			0
" but as he continues , one employee glances down distractedly at his phone and begins thumbing through his , new , supercharged @entity12 device			2
@entity14 's voice fades as a " screaming goat " appears on a desk and bleats loudly			1
a friend leaps out of nowhere , racquet in hand , saying , " @entity34 , forget work -- come play ! " eventually , the whole office is a race track and then even a pool party that only the one , distracted employee can see and hear			2
of course , the employee has missed the whole announcement			2
when it 's over and @entity14 asks for his response , he glibly replies , " you know it , @entity14			1
" @entity14 has no idea he 's been ignored			1
by casting himself as the butt of the joke , it 's as if @entity14 seeks to inoculate himself from critique			1
ca n't we all just lighten up ? everyone knows that this stuff is distracting			0
we have all pretended to be listening to someone on the phone or in real life while actually checking e-mail			0
at least @entity3 is aware of it , and -- if the commercial is to be believed -- the distractions it offers are pretty darned engaging			1
yes , you can be with your friends and at work at the same time			0
the ad is an apt , if sanguine , depiction of what i 've been calling " present shock , " the human incapacity to respond to everything happening all at once			1
in a rapid - fire , highly commercial digital environment , this sense of an overwhelming " now " reaches new heights			0
unlike computer chips , human beings can only process one thing at a time			0
whatever succeeds in attracting our attention only wins it at the expense of something else			0
joke as we might like about it , our efficiency , our accuracy , our memory and our depth of understanding go down when we try to multitask			2
yet @entity3 collapses time in more ways than that			1
consider how people from your distant past , as far back as , say , second grade , can show up right in your @entity3 present , asking to be " friends			1
" if you click yes , they will show up right alongside and indistinguishable from your current friends			0
the distance once afforded by decades of time vanishes in the @entity3 universe , as everything old is now again			1
but wait , there 's more			0
it 's not just the past that comes careering into the present on @entity3 , but the future			1
@entity3 is just the front end -- the consumer interface -- of a big data engine			1
@entity3 and its affiliates are busy churning the data generated from every keystroke to figure out who of us is likely to go on a diet , get pregnant , change political affiliation , question our sexuality and more			1
all so advertisers can act on our probable future behaviors by targeting marketing messages to us today			0
@entity3 brings us both friends from our past and advertisements from our future , all competing to distance us from the boring but emotionally grounded present			1
and this temporally compressed digital landscape is supposed to be our new " home			0
" meanwhile , as if to prove that humans really can exist in more than one place at the same time , our @entity3 profiles continue to carry on our online lives for us even when we 're not logged on			2
an advertising feature called @entity135 inserts our names and pictures into advertisements , so that we may endorse products tangentially associated with people or things we may have once " liked			0
" to our friends , it looks like we 're adding a live update , while in reality , we 're sleeping , eating or even tweeting elsewhere			0
this is the disorientation produced by present shock			0
i call it digiphrenia , the experience of trying to exist in more than one incarnation of yourself at the same time			0
of course , now that we 're in on the joke , we 're supposed to realize that coming back online to discover one of our other selves has been hawking a coffee bar we 've never even visited is n't a violation : it 's sort of funny			2
just take it in stride , like @entity14 does			2
in the end , however , the joke may really be on @entity14 after all			1
young people , teens in particular , are drifting away from @entity3 for less overwhelming social applications such as the 140 - character @entity166 and the intentionally temporary photo service @entity169			2
and when i looked up @entity12 online to try to find out just what it was , the first search results that came up were from users sharing how to disable it			0
this way , consumers can buy the discounted phones on which @entity12 ships , and turn them back into a regular @entity181 smartphones , where @entity3 is just another app we can use in our own good time			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity190 : new @entity3 app allows you to be disoriented even more by message flow
@entity14 butt of joke in ad for new app with employee ignoring him for @entity3 updates
@entity3 is the *eternal* " now , " he says , with future , present *coalescing* in bogus reality
he says @entity3 is really a big data *collection* agency , and it 's losing supporters and users
