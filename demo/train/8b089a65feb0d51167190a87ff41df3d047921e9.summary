-- if you view a tablet as a guilty pleasure , like i do , then buying the @entity1 should make you feel a little less guilty			1
@entity7 's new device does n't replace a computer for doing e-mail or composing documents , but it 's a fun hub for personal entertainment			1
and at $ 199 , @entity7 has managed to greatly undercut the price of @entity14 's @entity13 , the dominant tablet , and still churn out a good product			1
@entity14 calls its @entity13 " a magical and revolutionary product at an unbelievable price			1
" consider now that for the @entity13 's $ 499 price tag , i could buy two @entity1 tablets and still have cash left over for downloading apps and movies			1
however , except for price the @entity1 falls short of the @entity13 in just about every category			1
the @entity13 's processor is faster ; its software is more abundant , capable and polished ; its storage space is larger ; its screen is bigger ; and its body is more slender			1
still , the @entity1 is a good @entity30 tablet , and the price is fantastic			1
after testing the device this week , i found the @entity1 is the most impressive @entity13 rival among the dozens of tablets that have flooded the market this year			1
other @entity13 competitors have not sold well , but the new @entity1 will likely have a different fate			1
the @entity38 , which also came out this week but which i have not tested at length , costs $ 50 more and has weaker multimedia offerings			2
@entity7 and @entity41 are squaring off with a new line of inexpensive black - and - white e-readers , too			1
yes , those are still around , and bookworms love them			0
size , components and features many tablets are much faster and have more bells and whistles than the @entity1 , which does n't have cameras , gps or a microphone			2
( the latter is especially strange because even the year - old black - and - white kindle has a microphone			0
) unlike other tablets and e-readers , there also is no version of the @entity1 with cellular - data connectivity , meaning that would - be web surfers are limited to areas with @entity30			1
forgetting for a moment about the guts inside , the @entity1 does not feel cheap			2
the back is rubbery and does n't slip out of my hands			0
it 's not ultra thin , but it 's girth and weight makes it comfortable to hold for long periods of time , like a paperback book			0
because the @entity1 is significantly smaller than the @entity13 -- with a 7 - inch - wide screen versus the @entity13 's 9.7 - inch more boxy display -- it weighs about a third less			1
the built - in speakers sound ok and get about as loud as an alarm clock			0
there is also a place to plug in headphones			0
but the @entity1 's battery loses a charger much faster than the @entity13			1
i was able to surf the @entity87 and play videos for several hours , but i found myself frequently searching for a charger after that			0
that @entity7 skimped on some of the components becomes evident when swiping through menus , switching the screen 's orientation or playing games , which can all be jerky at times			1
the split - second delays are even present when turning pages on a @entity1 e-book , which should be the pride of an @entity7 device			1
the lack of a microphone means no @entity103 or other internet telephony programs			0
browser and os @entity7 's @entity108 web browser has the features i 'd expect and can play most videos found online			1
@entity7 touts the browser 's unique speed enhancements , but probably due to the device 's lower - end components , it does n't show			1
web pages generally take a few seconds longer to load than on computers or other tablets			0
also , i am somewhat uncomfortable with the idea that @entity108 , as a means of speeding up load times , sends information from every page i visit to @entity7 's servers			1
this kindle 's operating system is based on @entity128 's @entity127 , but @entity7 has changed it so extensively that i barely noticed the similarities			1
a setback to this approach is that @entity7 did not include some basic features , like the ability to copy and paste text , or to quickly switch between running applications			2
but overall , the interface is attractive and neatly laid out			0
on the home screen , the top bar allows me to search for content on the device or search the web with @entity128			0
below that is a list of categories like news , books , music and apps			0
in the main area , i have a bookshelf that includes recently opened items or apps organized in a carousel , plus other shelves full of my favorites			0
movies and e-books @entity7 's multimedia offerings are pretty extensive and have been available on other platforms for some time			1
the company runs the biggest e-bookstore and the second - biggest music download store			0
many publishers offer their newspapers and magazines in the @entity1 newsstand , but the @entity1 's small screen size is not ideal for reading , say , an issue of @entity170 or the @entity172 front page			2
the built - in @entity7 shopping app is well designed			2
each @entity1 comes with a free 30 - day subscription to @entity175 , whose primary perk ( for $ 79 a year ) is free two - day shipping on every item the company sells			2
the prime membership also gives new @entity1 owners a taste of its @entity185 service , which has 13,000 movies and tv shows available for streaming on demand			2
tens of thousands more are available for purchase			0
for those who prefer @entity193 , that company released a new version this week for the @entity1 and other @entity127 tablets			2
but overall , @entity7 's appstore carries far fewer apps than @entity14 's online store and even @entity128 's own @entity199			1
developers are required to list their @entity127 apps separately with @entity7			0
( yes , the @entity1 does have " @entity202			0
" ) a few bugs the bare - bones e-mail client that comes with the @entity1 does not support @entity205 , which many companies use for their e-mail system			2
the app encourages users to download another e-mail program from the @entity211 , but it does n't specify which one to get			0
holding the tablet upright and typing with my thumbs is fairly efficient , but the system occasionally does n't register my taps right away if i type fast			0
i also ran into several bugs throughout the @entity1 's software			2
sometimes my @entity220 would crash for no reason , and other times , images would not show up in the gallery			0
some third - party developers apparently did not account for @entity7 not including volume buttons on the hardware , and so i had to adjust the volume from the settings menu activated by tapping the menu bar			2
these are issues that i expect will get fixed over time through software updates			0
the bottom line the overall software experience is pleasant and integrated from top to bottom			0
i am never asked to punch in my credit card to buy things , which is convenient			0
when i first turned on the @entity1 , the software recognized who i am because it was already tied to my @entity7 account			1
after a few clicks , i was set up without ever connecting to a computer to synchronize anything			0
the music i bought through the @entity7 mp3 store and the books i 've gotten through the @entity248 were all ready to go			0
the @entity13 remains the superior tablet , and it 's the closest i 've found to replacing a laptop			1
but i would n't discount a less capable competitor			0
the @entity1 is a good entertainment device at a price that 's truly unbelievable .			1

@entity7 's @entity1 is a multimedia - heavy *touchscreen* tablet computer
it 's significantly cheaper than the @entity13 , the *undisputed* leader in the tablet market
the @entity1 first went on sale this week
reviewer : @entity1 is a good entertainment device at a price that 's truly unbelievable
