@entity2 in this narrow @entity2 hutong , the rainbow flag flies free			0
i 'm in @entity5 , a popular meeting place for the local gay community			2
here , i meet with some of the country 's leading @entity8 ( lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ) advocates to learn about gay identity in @entity15			1
in the last two decades , @entity15 's @entity8 community has made huge gains in social acceptance			1
@entity19 was decriminalized in 1997 , and a few years later it was removed from an official list of mental illnesses			0
but unlike their counterparts in the @entity24 , @entity15 's @entity8 community does not have to face down strident political opposition or right - wing religious uproar			1
for them , the biggest source of pressure comes from the family , brought on in part by @entity15 's one - child policy			1
" you have only one child so you want your child to be as ' normal ' as everybody else , " says @entity33 , executive director of the @entity34			0
" there 's also the pressure of carrying on the family line , " adds @entity40 founder @entity39			1
fake marriages ? many @entity15 gays and lesbians are responding to the family pressure with " cooperative marriages " -- gay men and lesbian women marrying each other out of social and economic convenience , often finding each other online			1
" i grew up in the 80s and 90s and most of the people my age , everyone , got into marriage -- no matter gay or straight , " says @entity61 , founder of the advocacy group @entity62			0
" if you 're not , you 're a monster			0
" despite advances , the social stigma remains immense			0
according to a 2013 survey by @entity70 research group @entity69 , only 21 % of @entity15 's population was in favor of the acceptance of homosexuality			1
same - sex marriage remains a taboo topic for many across @entity15			2
and a number of clinics in @entity15 offer so - called " conversion " shock treatment to " cure " homosexuality			2
earlier this year , a @entity2 court heard @entity15 's first case to challenge the treatment			1
but a delay in the ruling has raised concerns in the gay community that clinics may continue to provide such treatments without challenge			0
discrimination @entity15 's @entity8 professionals must also contend with a lack of legal protection against discrimination at work			1
" the job discrimination is very subtle and you might not get a promotion because you are single			0
you might get fired because of all kinds of reasons , " says to			0
" there 's no protection			2
" though @entity15 has a long way to go before its gay professionals thrive professionally in all workplaces , @entity15 gay activists are encouraged by the recent announcement by @entity113 ceo @entity112			0
" i think @entity112 's coming out of the closet is very important to the @entity15 society , especially in the business world , " @entity33 tells me			2
" it also very effectively motivated people into thinking about the direct and non-direct connections between homosexual people and the products that we all use in our lives			0
" new generation with these forces for change coming from both outside and inside @entity15 , the country 's @entity8 community is forging ahead , despite its unique set of challenges			1
" for the past ten years , the most change probably came from the visibility of the @entity8 community in @entity15 society			1
for the next ten years , i would say it 's the visibility of lgbt rights in @entity15 , " says @entity61			2
as the focus shifts to a stronger call for greater rights , @entity15 's pioneering gay activists are looking to the younger generation to pick up the mantle			1
" this generation is a lot more confident and self - assertive , " @entity39 tells me			0
" and they have more resources , " adds @entity61			0
" in the end , i think we 're fighting not just for a better situation for @entity8 ( people ) , but a better situation for all minorities and vulnerable people , " says to			0
out and proud , @entity15 's gay activists are an increasingly vocal minority pushing for change that could very well reach every corner of @entity15 society .			1

@entity15 's @entity8 community has made huge gains in social acceptance
unlike @entity169 counterparts , they face little religious opposition
the biggest source of pressure comes from family , and the one - child policy
there is no legal protection in the work place for the @entity180
