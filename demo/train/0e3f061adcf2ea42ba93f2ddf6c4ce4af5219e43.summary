@entity0 -- @entity3 founder @entity2 was granted bail tuesday after a hearing at @entity6 in @entity0 , but a lawyer representing @entity9 prosecutors immediately filed an appeal			1
that means @entity2 will remain in jail until the next hearing , which should be before the @entity15 within 48 hours , lawyers said			1
the 39 - year - old @entity16 handed himself over to @entity0 police last week to answer a @entity20 arrest warrant over alleged sex crimes in @entity9			1
@entity2 is facing accusations of rape , sexual molestation and illegal use of force in separate incidents in august in @entity28			2
he could be sentenced to two years in prison if convicted			0
his lawyers deny the allegations and have vowed to fight any attempts at extradition			0
the magistrate agreed to grant bail tuesday after @entity36 , a former @entity37 army officer who founded @entity0 's @entity38 , testified that @entity2 could stay at his mansion in @entity40			1
@entity36 will keep @entity2 " if not under house arrest , at least under mansion arrest , " said defense attorney @entity43			2
at that , @entity2 , dressed in a white shirt and a blue jacket and sitting in a glassed - in corner of the court with three security guards , smiled wryly			1
the magistrate set bail at 200,000 pounds ( about $ 315,000 ) plus two sureties of 20,000 pounds each ( about $ 31,500 )			0
@entity2 's passport must remain with police , and he will be monitored by a location tag			1
@entity2 must be at @entity36 's mansion , about two hours outside of @entity0 , for at least four hours overnight and four hours during the day			1
he will be required to report to police daily between 6 and 8 p.m. the next court hearing was scheduled for january 11			0
after the conditions were set , @entity2 stood and said , " i understand , " with a neutral expression			2
his mother @entity60 told reporters after the hearing that she was " very , very happy " and thanked " the media for all your support of my son			2
" but several hours later , @entity9 filed its appeal			1
outside the court , about 100 people demonstrated in support of @entity2 , holding signs saying " @entity2 is a political prisoner " and " why are you shooting the messenger ? " and " this is not 1984			1
" during the hearing , @entity2 's team of attorneys argued that since he is only wanted for questioning and has not been formally charged , he is presumed innocent			1
but , said @entity83 , the attorney representing the @entity9 prosecution , " the court has already found that mr. @entity2 is a flight risk			1
nothing has changed in this regard			0
" she said if the alleged offenses had occurred in @entity89 , " it undoubtedly would have been a charge of rape in this jurisdiction			0
celebrity supporters of @entity2 at the hearing included @entity96 , who sat next to @entity97 , niece of the late @entity100 politician @entity99 and current @entity100 president @entity101 , and prominent left - wing journalist @entity102			2
socialite @entity103 came to court but it is not clear she got into the very crowded hearing room			0
many were turned away for lack of space			0
judge @entity111 denied @entity2 's first request for bail at a hearing on december 7 on the grounds that there was a risk he would fail to surrender			1
on tuesday , he cited four reasons for his insistence a week earlier on keeping @entity2 in jail : his lack of fixed residence , confusion over when and how he last entered the @entity37 , the evidence against him in @entity9 , and a dispute over whether @entity2 is wanted only for questioning or for prosecution			1
@entity36 's offer of his mansion satisfied @entity111 on the question of an address , and testimony from someone who arrived in the @entity37 with @entity2 from @entity134 answered that question , he said			2
he said he was not taking a position on the @entity9 evidence against @entity2 , and that a future hearing would have to determine whether @entity2 was wanted for questioning or prosecution			1
@entity3 ' release of thousands of secret @entity143 diplomatic and military documents is under criminal review in the @entity143			0
almost half of @entity37 believe that the sex charges against @entity2 are " an excuse " to keep him in custody so that the @entity143 government can prosecute him for releasing secret diplomatic cables , a new poll for @entity1 shows			2
the @entity153 poll of @entity37 opinion , released monday on the eve of @entity2 's bail hearing , finds that 44 % of respondents in @entity89 believe that @entity9 's sex charges are just a pretext , while only 13 % flatly disagree			1
the remaining 43 % say they do n't know			0
last week , @entity143 attorney general @entity161 said he had authorized " significant " actions related to a criminal investigation into @entity3 ' publication of the materials but has declined to elaborate			0
@entity3 inflamed @entity143 authorities last month by publishing the first of a large group of confidential @entity143 diplomatic cables			0
only a small fraction of the 250,000 @entity172 documents have been released and more are being published daily			0
@entity143 authorities and other @entity175 leaders say the documents ' publication threatens lives and national security			0
