i spent time in @entity2 earlier this week , and it 's clear to me that the @entity2 tech scene is at an inflection point			1
the time to invest in @entity2 's future is now			2
and with more startups than any other @entity10 country at the @entity11 this year , and a strong infrastructure in place , @entity2 is primed to embrace the latest technology transition : digitization of everything			1
digitization , which harnesses the power of what we call the @entity21 at @entity22 -- the connection of people , process , data and things -- will change everything from the way we work to how we serve citizens , and teach our young people			1
i believe that @entity2 will lead in this new era of country digitization			1
the @entity2 government truly understands the economic and societal benefits digitization will bring			1
this week , i met with prime minister @entity38 , and together we announced an ambitious partnership , pledging to transform @entity2 into a digital republic			2
by creating a connected ecosystem , there is tremendous opportunity to fuel economic growth , create jobs , foster innovation -- even improve energy use			0
@entity22 will power this initiative through the network			0
@entity2 has a strong traditional infrastructure in place -- roads , water lines , buildings , even parking spaces -- and the country is now committing to build out their digital infrastructure , which will help increase productivity , create jobs , and improve the lives of citizens			2
cybersecurity will also be enhanced for the country and its businesses and citizens , and the results for @entity2 could be dramatic			0
with our @entity68 program , @entity22 plans to train an incremental 200,000 students and create 1,500 additional academies over the next three years , so @entity2 entrepreneurs have the necessary skills to drive the digitization process			1
a key ingredient to @entity2 's success will also be the entrepreneurial spirit and technical talent needed for digitization			2
our first step is to ensure the proper training initiatives are in place to achieve this - providing a $ 100 million investment that will include training and infrastructure support to transform @entity2 into a digital republic			0
digitization has the potential to revolutionize @entity2 as we know it today			1
this transformation will contribute to @entity2 's overall global competitiveness by supporting job growth , education , cybersecurity , innovation and entrepreneurial initiatives in @entity2			0
it 's also expected to lead to a boost in @entity2 's @entity97 by 1 - 2 percent			0
this is a chance for @entity2 to innovate based on @entity2 values -- egalitarian peer - to peer internet architecture -- one that creates new digital freedoms and significant socio - economic growth			0
if countries get ahead of this technology transition , like @entity2 , it could change the global agenda			0
this new phase of the internet will bring many opportunities to revolutionize the world as we know it , as long as leaders are ready to embrace it			1
