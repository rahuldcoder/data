@entity0 -- a latino rights group and other immigrant and labor organizations called thursday for a national boycott of @entity6 over the state 's new immigration law , which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal @entity13 residency			1
the call for a boycott was led by the @entity16 , which bills itself as the largest national @entity19 civil rights and advocacy organization in the @entity13			1
other organizations calling for the boycott include the @entity22 , the @entity23 , the @entity24 , the @entity25 , the @entity26 , the @entity27 , and the @entity28			0
the groups pledged not to hold major conventions , conferences or other special events involving significant travel to @entity6 from out of state and " asked others to consider whether their purchases of goods and services might perpetuate the unjust and discriminatory law in @entity6 , " @entity16 said on its website			1
" when a law so contrary to our values is passed , we must act decisively , " said @entity16 president and ceo @entity42			2
" we are calling for a boycott because this law will blow open the door to increased racial profiling , wrongful arrests and other discrimination			1
" @entity6 gov. @entity52 , who signed the immigration measure april 23 , says it does not involve racial profiling or any other illegal acts			1
the law , known as @entity58 , is scheduled to go into effect this summer			0
the measure has drawn criticism in the @entity13 and abroad			2
in @entity6 , the @entity63 and @entity64 city councils voted this week to file suit against the measure			2
the city councils said they 're taking action because of concerns over enforcement costs and negative effects on @entity6 's tourism industry			0
in @entity63 , council member @entity72 introduced a motion for " the city attorney to bring a legal challenge " because the immigration bill is " unconstitutional " and " a bad law , which could cost the city millions of dollars in lawsuits			0
" " this bill opens the door to racial profiling , and it puts @entity83 in @entity6 in automatic suspect mode , " @entity72 said			1
@entity63 mayor @entity85 said up to 38 percent of retail sales in the city come from legal @entity89 visitors			0
the state immigration law threatens @entity63 's businesses , @entity85 said , just when " the city is just beginning to recover from the economic downturn			1
" criticism also has come from abroad , with the @entity89 government issuing an advisory to its citizens last week to avoid travel to @entity6			0
the @entity99 expressed its concern about the law last week , and presidents of @entity104 countries meeting in @entity105 for a gathering of the @entity107 condemned the law tuesday			0
well - known @entity89 writer @entity112 recommended this week that dark - skinned people , men with mustaches , women who use shawls , or anyone who does not speak @entity118 well should not go to @entity6 , because the state has " officially declared itself racist , " the government - run @entity110 news service reported wednesday			0
the @entity122 basketball team also criticized the new law , and wore jerseys marked " @entity128 " in wednesday night 's @entity126 playoff game against the @entity127			0
" the frustration with the federal government 's failure to deal with the issue of illegal immigration resulted in passage of a flawed state law , " @entity128 managing partner @entity129 said in a statement			0
" however intended , the result of passing this law is that our basic principles of equal rights and protection under the law are being called into question , and @entity6 's already struggling economy will suffer even further setbacks at a time when the state can ill - afford them			1
" @entity6 legislators say they passed the law because the federal government has failed to safeguard the border with @entity89 , allowing more than 450,000 undocumented immigrants to settle in the state			2
on thursday , @entity158 sen. @entity157 of @entity159 wrote a letter to @entity52 , asking @entity6 to delay implementing the law for one year " in order to permit @entity163 sufficient time to enact comprehensive immigration reform to address @entity6 's security needs			1
