not so long ago , @entity0 was a backpacker 's game			1
other than a few business - class hotels in the capital of @entity6 and a handful of isolated luxury properties scattered about the scenic hinterlands , travelers could expect little in the way of genuine comfort while exploring one of the most beautiful and eco-conscious countries on the planet			2
over the past decade , however , @entity0 's fastest - growing crop has been a collection of opulent hotels and resort communities , complemented by marinas , golf courses , gourmet restaurants , hot springs and other world - class facilities			1
the tag attached to most deluxe properties is usually something like " ecolodge " or " ecoresort , " which may conjure visions of dreadlocks , granola and recycled hemp - fiber sheets			0
yes , most of the country 's destinations are green ; @entity0 's @entity36 rewards environmentally friendly properties with one to five " leaves " and copious free publicity			1
but @entity0 's new upscale properties are as elegant and comfortable as any in @entity41			1
here are the best regions and stays for putting a little service and @entity45 into your sand and scenery			2
gulf of @entity50 @entity0 's posh spot is @entity50 , a sparkling strand of beaches in the northwestern @entity54			1
once better known for sabaneros ( cowboys ) and fine horses , @entity55 has been developed into @entity60 's premier luxury destination			2
it even has its own international airport ( @entity63 ) just minutes away in the regional capital of @entity65			0
lavish rental properties , excellent restaurants and bellowing howler monkeys might convince you to stay put for your entire vacation			0
but it 's worth leaving the luxury ( and wildlife ) to see some of the region 's outstanding national parks and festive beach communities			1
accommodations are led by the exquisite @entity78 , the top pick in a scenic region that boasts @entity0 's best resorts , golf courses , spas and white - sand beaches			1
5 reasons to visit @entity86 @entity87 @entity89 jungle hills surround tiny @entity87 , considered @entity0 's most beautiful , as well as its original upscale destination			1
it 's also one of the most wildlife - rich regions in the world , which means you 're certain to spot several species of monkeys , sloths and tropical birds , among other animals			2
excellent restaurants , sparkling nightlife , art galleries and an array of adventure tour operators make it a honeymooner 's choice			2
when traveling in high season ( december through february ) , make reservations well in advance , and be prepared for crowds			0
among numerous upscale hotel choices , the prestigious @entity110 has received the @entity113 's @entity112 along with its top @entity114 for luxury and comfort			2
within walking distance of the national park , the gorgeously landscaped property is an attraction in its own right			0
@entity122 until 2011 , @entity122 was @entity0 's most active volcano			1
alas , for area entrepreneurs , the lava flows that graced so many tourism brochures have mellowed to mere puffs of smoke			0
on the upside , you can now get excellent deals on the region 's dozen or so five - star properties , the best of which are known for their spectacular hot springs			0
the gold standard is @entity138 and @entity139 , with world - class rooms and restaurants , as well as a river of steaming natural water , which feeds extravagant gardens and spas			0
a close runner - up is the @entity147			0
it features a dozen cascading pools and whimsically decorated rooms			0
no matter where you stay , virtually all area hotels will arrange day trips to the many hot springs pouring from @entity122 's slopes , a must while you 're in @entity0			1
@entity158 on the tip of @entity160 , the wide white - sand beaches of @entity158 have become a playground for celebrities , jet - setters and vanguard surfers			0
you 'll need to take a ferry or small plane to the isolated spot ( often voted @entity60 's most beautiful beach ) , where an array of luxury boutique hotels and condo rentals await			1
the fabulous oceanfront @entity174 and @entity175 are full - service resorts that wo n't disappoint			0
@entity177 @entity0 's most famous beach town is growing up , its scruffy surf shacks and beach bars now complemented with excellent restaurants and attractive accommodations			1
despite complaints that paving the roads and erecting high rises have compromised @entity177 's authentic local flavor , the surfing is still awesome , and the neighboring beaches of @entity189 , known for nesting sea turtles , have remained pristine			2
@entity177 's top - end options are well - established , such as the sprawling the @entity193 and plush rental properties at @entity194			1
but there are other interesting options , including the romantic @entity197 de @entity198 , which gets high marks for its attentive staff , and the golf resort at nearby @entity203 resort , which sits astride three miles of superb shoreline			0
the cloud forests an escape from lowland heat and humidity , @entity0 's mountains and volcanoes are topped with misty cloud forests , where temperatures hover between 12 and @entity213 ( 53 to 68 f ) year - round and visitors will find a number of outstanding mountain lodges			1
some travelers may want to skip @entity219 , @entity0 's most famous cloud forest ( aka " crowd forest " )			1
lodges such as @entity223 and @entity224 and @entity138 offer access to quieter , private wildlife reserves			0
others such as @entity228 and @entity229 are located on coffee plantations and have beautiful trails good for wildlife viewing			0
the imaginative @entity234 , @entity233 is a unique spot with lots of wildlife to watch from gorgeous jungle positions			0
@entity239 an hour from @entity6 and the country 's international airport , @entity242 and @entity243 is @entity0 's best value for luxury digs			1
anchored by the graceful @entity246 , surrounded by scores of extravagant rental properties , an adorable marina area and one of the country 's best golf courses , @entity239 offers almost everything you 'd want from a tropical vacation , albeit without the hassle of actually seeing @entity0			2
by " almost everything , " it 's worth mentioning that there 's no real beach , hence the spectacular collection of swimming pools			2
