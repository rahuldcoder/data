-- wednesday 's decision by the @entity2 to repeal six federal trademarks of the @entity4 on the grounds that the name is " disparaging to @entity7 " is , of course , a victory for the @entity10 community and our allies			1
yet we have been here before			2
in 1999 , @entity13 , who is @entity14 and @entity15 , won a battle against the @entity4 after a three - judge panel of the @entity18 ruled against the team and removed its trademark protections			1
but that decision was later appealed and the ruling overturned , and the team regained its trademarks			1
that is why today 's decision is certainly worth celebrating , but not without a sense of hesitation			2
should team owner @entity30 's appeal to the @entity2 fail , then we can celebrate even louder -- and even louder when the name is changed			1
still , @entity30 's trademark attorney @entity32 is adamant that the team will , again , emerge victorious and win its appeal			1
" we 've seen this before , " @entity32 said in a press release on wednesday			2
" and just like last time , today 's ruling will have no effect at all on the team 's ownership of and right to use the @entity4 name and logo			1
" but what @entity32 has n't seen before is a proliferation of voices opposing the team name			2
members of @entity54 , local @entity49 officials , celebrities , media commentators and even former @entity4 like cornerback @entity52 have spoken out against the team name and urged @entity30 to relent and change the name			1
@entity52 even likened the team name to the n - word			1
" when you hear a @entity10 say that ' @entity4 ' is degrading , it 's almost like the n - word for a black person , " @entity52 told @entity59			1
on wednesday , senate majority leader @entity66 , speaking on the capitol floor in response to the trademark repeal , said , " this is extremely important to @entity7 all over the country that they no longer use this name			1
the writing is on the wall			2
" the @entity75 team and the @entity76 , of course , realize the cancellation of the trademark protection hits them where it hurts -- their pocketbook , which was the whole point of the case brought by @entity82 , a @entity83 , who was one of five plaintiffs to contest the team 's federal trademark protection			1
if the team wo n't change the name voluntarily then it will be changed by force , not unlike how the team was forced to integrate black football players in the 1960s			2
now , without trademark protection , anyone can make and sell @entity4 shirts , jerseys , hats and all manner of schwag without the legal muscle to hinder imitation @entity4 products			1
yet this issue is bigger than the @entity4			1
it 's bigger than the slur alone			1
this is a campaign of dignity and humanity			2
the @entity75 team may be threatened by the very real possibility that it will have to change its name in the near future , but that does n't let the @entity115 off the hook , or the @entity117 , for that matter			2
but they 're feeling the pressure , too			0
native americans also are working to remove the @entity115 logo of @entity123			0
this movement is about the dehumanization of @entity7 on every level -- not just in sports , but in media and @entity129 , as well			0
this is about respect and about the mental stability of our children			0
empirical study has proven that @entity7 mascots harm the mental health of @entity10 children			0
they report to have low self - esteem , a limited sense of social worth and do not believe they can accomplish as much as students from other racial and ethnic backgrounds			1
these scientific studies do routinely fall on deaf ears , and somehow people , even prominent ones , continue to fight for the privilege to use the racial slur			1
@entity153 , the @entity154 sportscaster , recently defended the use of the name and called the controversy " nuts			0
" " i mean , for 70 - some odd years this was a zero issue , and then it became an issue , " he said			2
but that 's not quite accurate			0
@entity13 and even the @entity164 leader @entity163 fought against the name as well as all manner of @entity7 mascotry for decades			0
but with the continuing ubiquity of the @entity170 and social media , the @entity10 voice has amplified			0
just because someone could n't hear our elders in the 1960s and 1970s raging against the name does n't mean they were n't responding to this form of racism as well as fighting for our rights as indigenous peoples			0
i was asked recently why the mascot issue matters more than the epidemic of poverty on reservations			0
or why we are bothered more by a word than the high school dropout rate of @entity10 students , which is the highest in the country			0
it 's not that names matter more , it 's that when we talk about death rates , rape and epidemics in @entity7 country we do n't always get a response			0
but when we interrupt sports ? we always get a response			0
@entity82 , the plaintiff in the previous case , @entity199 , told @entity59 what she would say to @entity75 owner @entity202			0
" i 'd ask him , ' would you dare call me a redskin , right here , to my face ? ' " she says			0
" and i suspect that , no , he would not do that			0

@entity210 *wonders* if the latest trademark ruling could be the beginning of the end
but a similar 1999 ruling was overturned on appeal
without trademark protection , he says @entity4 t - shirts and schwag could be *freely* sold
@entity223 : owners and some fans continue to fight for the privilege to use the racial slur
