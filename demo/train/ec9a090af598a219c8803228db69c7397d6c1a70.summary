@entity0 -- last november , @entity3 voters planted the seeds for serious immigration reform when they backed president @entity6 by a record margin			1
this april , we 'll see if those seeds can grow in @entity11 's toxic partisan soil			2
@entity12 returns from spring break monday , and immigration reform tops the agenda			1
the @entity25 's bipartisan " @entity24 " is preparing to release its long - awaited plan for resolving the status of 11 million undocumented men , women , and children now living in @entity23 's shadows			1
can a unique confluence of factors -- a @entity29 president trying to build his legacy , a @entity31 grappling with new demographic realities -- overcome the usual strong bias for inaction in a sharply divided @entity12 ? the answer remains unclear			2
" what we have now is not a 21st century legal immigration system , " @entity31 sen. @entity36 of @entity37 , a key conservative at the heart of the talks , said back in january			1
" we have an obligation and the need to address the reality of the situation that we face			2
" who 's in the @entity24 ? the list includes @entity36 ; sen. @entity49 , @entity51 - @entity50 ; sen. @entity52 , @entity53 ; sen. @entity54 , @entity53 ; sen. @entity55 , @entity56 ; sen. @entity57 , @entity58 ; sen. @entity59 , @entity60 ; and sen. @entity61 , @entity63 - @entity62			0
farm worker dispute holding up immigration bill details of the @entity25 plan a source familiar with negotiations recently told @entity1 that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the thorniest issues , including the establishment of a path to citizenship and the creation of a system to assess the state of border security			1
the @entity25 proposal could come " in the next couple of weeks , " @entity49 said sunday on @entity83 's " @entity82			1
" but @entity52 told reporters later sunday morning that he still thinks " it 's very likely " and " very possible " to have it done by the end of the week			0
" i 'm guardedly optimistic			0
i ca n't guarantee it			0
but we have literally almost all of the issues resolved , " he said			0
specifically , the senators have agreed to a 13 - year path to citizenship , the source said			0
it would take 10 years for undocumented workers to get a green card , and then another three years to gain citizenship			2
along the way , undocumented workers would have to pay a fine and back taxes , and pass a background check			2
the size of the fine remains unclear			0
no undocumented worker would be eligible for citizenship until the border is considered secure			0
to measure border security , a commission would be created with the task of establishing and assessing a set of quantifiable criteria			0
the commission would be made up of officials named by state and federal leaders			0
sides reach broad agreement on immigrant guest workers disagreement over agricultural workers a sharp disagreement over the future treatment of undocumented workers on @entity23 's farms , however , is currently holding up progress on the bill			1
the two key sticking points are wages and the number of visas to be granted to undocumented farm workers , two other sources close to the talks confirmed friday			1
four senators -- @entity36 , @entity59 , @entity136 @entity31 @entity135 , and @entity138 democrat @entity137 -- are trying to deal with the matter			2
" it 's the one major unresolved issue , " one of the sources told @entity1			0
the sources were unable to provide specifics in terms of the number of visas or wage levels under consideration			2
but generally speaking , agricultural businesses have an interest in more visas and lower wages			1
labor leaders , in contrast , typically support fewer visas and higher wages			1
saying there are a " few little kerfuffles " to work out in the drafting of the legislation -- referring to the disagreement over agricultural workers -- @entity61 told @entity1 on sunday the senators have written " most of the bill " and feel hopeful that they can announce a full agreement at the end of the week			1
" we 've solved most of the issues , there are a few more to go , there are a few more today and tomorrow			0
i 'm very optimistic we 'll be able to solve those last few problems , " he said , declining to get into specifics			0
language like ' illegal immigrant ' seen as a challenge agreement on nonagricultural workers business and labor leaders appear to have settled on a deal establishing a new immigrant guest worker program for nonagricultural workers			1
the compromise , according to another source , is the creation of a new " w " visa for lesser - skilled workers not working in agriculture			1
those workers would be allowed to enter the country based on labor market shortages , and could enter with the possibility of eventually applying for citizenship			2
the @entity196 visa would affect housekeepers , landscapers , retail workers and some construction workers , the source noted			2
the agreement does not address visas for high - skilled workers or family members			1
according to the @entity207 's understanding of the agreement , the visa program would launch in april 2015			0
the number of visas issued would never go below 20,000 per year and could rise as high as 200,000 annually , depending on employment levels			2
one third of the visas would be reserved for businesses that employ fewer than 25 people , while no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction workers , the @entity207 said			1
a new government department , the @entity218 and @entity219 , would determine specific industries with labor shortages and make recommendations to @entity12			0
the agency would also play a role in setting an annual cap for @entity196 visas			2
the bureau would fall under the existing @entity228 , and its director would be appointed by the president and confirmed by @entity12			0
" the beauty of this program is that it rises and falls with the economy , " the @entity207 's @entity231 recently told @entity1			0
" when the economy is booming , there will be more visas available for foreign workers			1
when it 's not , there wo n't be , and that 's something we 've never seen in the @entity23 before			0
" @entity244 , senior vice president of the @entity245 , released a statement declaring the proposed new visa program " a sound and workable program for the business community			0
" immigration tops agenda as senators tour border @entity25 resistance the gang of eight may be ideologically diverse , but that does n't mean there wo n't be significant resistance to the plan once it 's released -- especially among wary conservatives			1
@entity31 base voters remain vehemently opposed to any plan which could be construed as amnesty for those who entered the country illegally			1
@entity268 , meanwhile , remain concerned that conservatives will never agree the country 's southern border is secure , and will try to use that issue to continually deny citizenship to undocumented residents			1
in the @entity25 , @entity276 @entity31 @entity275 and others have repeatedly expressed the fear that @entity29 leaders will try to ram the @entity24 's plan through before other members have a chance to properly consider the bill			1
top @entity268 " want @entity12 to pass a far - reaching bill before the @entity23 people know what 's in it , " @entity275 said in a statement released april 2			0
" now that the special interests have what they want , the deal has been made : force it through and set the public interest aside			2
" @entity36 has also said he 's worried the legislation may be rushed through @entity12 -- a concern some observers say reflects political necessities as the @entity37 freshman balances his role in immigration reform with possible presidential ambitions			1
responding to @entity31 pressure to release details of the secretive gang of eight deliberations , @entity36 promised friday to brief his fellow @entity31 senators on tuesday			0
" this proposal will be a starting point , " @entity36 wrote to four @entity31 colleagues			2
" i expect you will have ample opportunity to review , comment , and amend as you see fit			0
" @entity312 chairman @entity311 , @entity313 , who will oversee the committee - level markup of the bill once it 's released , has repeatedly dismissed sessions ' and @entity36 's concerns			0
the @entity312 " has already held several widely - attended hearings to examine the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform , " @entity311 said in an april 2 statement			1
" if we do not act quickly and decisively we will lose the opportunity we now have			0
" @entity311 said he hopes for a final @entity25 vote by this summer			1
immigration debate : high - stakes political poker a @entity329 alternative while most eyes are focused on the @entity25 , a bipartisan group of @entity329 members is working on its own version of immigration reform			1
speaker @entity335 , @entity336 , told reporters last month that the members are " essentially in agreement " on a plan to deal with the issue			1
the @entity329 members involved in the talks are rep. @entity344 , @entity345 ; rep. @entity346 , @entity347 ; rep. @entity348 , @entity347 ; rep. @entity349 , @entity350 ; rep. @entity351 , @entity138 ; rep. @entity352 , @entity58 ; rep. @entity353 , @entity138 ; and rep. @entity354 , @entity355			1
the members of the @entity329 group have been reluctant to talk publicly about their bipartisan negotiations			1
some of them have been working on the issue since @entity12 failed to get a deal done in 2007			1
however , two members of the @entity363 " sounded confident sunday that their upcoming proposal will ultimately mesh well with the @entity25 's proposal , despite expected battles over the issue in both chambers in the months ahead			2
" i am very , very optimistic that the @entity329 is going to have a plan that is going to be able to go to a conference with the @entity25 in which we 're going to be able to resolve differences , " rep. @entity352 , @entity58 , said on @entity1 's " @entity373			1
" he was joined by his @entity31 colleague rep. @entity344 of @entity37			0
asked if the @entity329 version would have a similar border security prerequisite , the two @entity329 members seemed less certain			2
" you ca n't have a bill without border security			0
you just ca n't , " @entity344 said			0
pressed further on whether that provision would be a priority , @entity352 said , " i think we can do this simultaneously			0
" " i think first thing we 're going to do is , we 're going to put people in a safe place			0
that is 11 million people , you can give them a work permit , social security card , driver 's license , " he added			0
" and then the second part is the path to the green card , that permanent residency that leads to citizenship			0
" @entity329 members optimistic about immigration overhaul @entity1 's @entity403 , @entity404 , and @entity405 contributed to this report			1

@entity25 negotiators are close to a comprehensive immigration reform deal
one key sticking point is visas and wages for agricultural workers
despite the bipartisan talks , many conservatives remain *skeptical*
the @entity329 is working on its own bipartisan plan
