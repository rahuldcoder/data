@entity0 -- federal investigators will declare the 2001 anthrax case solved on wednesday , when they make public their case against government researcher @entity5 , a government source familiar with the case told @entity1 on tuesday			1
ex-army scientist @entity5 , seen here in 2003 , died from an apparent suicide last week			1
but the case will not be considered closed , because administrative details remain incomplete , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing			1
before making the information public , the @entity16 is expected to share the evidence of @entity5 ' involvement with survivors and relatives of victims in the anthrax attacks , the source said			1
a lawyer for @entity25 , the widow of @entity26 , the first victim of the 2001 attacks , said she was invited to the session and will attend			1
the tabloid photo editor died after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to @entity33 , the publisher of the @entity35 and @entity36 tabloids , at its offices in @entity38 , @entity39			2
another source familiar with the investigation said tuesday that in the fall of 2001 , @entity5 borrowed a machine that can convert wet anthrax , the kind used at @entity46 , into dry powder , which was found in the anthrax letters			1
such machines , called lyophilizers , are not usually used at @entity46 , where @entity5 worked , though they are easy to obtain			2
experts said the report may have no significance			0
" i would n't necessarily make the conclusion that , just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer , that that provides a smoking gun , that he must be using this for sinister purposes , " said @entity56 , chairman of microbiology at @entity58 in @entity0			0
@entity66 , a former biodefense scientist who worked with @entity5 at the lab at @entity46 , said there was " no way " a lyophilizer could have created the fine anthrax spores used in the 2001 letters			1
@entity66 said a more advanced machine would have been needed , and that no one working at a @entity76 government lab could have produced such high quality anthrax in secret			0
@entity5 , who is expected to be blamed for the mailings of the toxin , which killed five people and sickened more than a dozen others -- died july 27 at a hospital in @entity84 , @entity85 , from an apparent suicide attempt two days earlier			2
no charges have been made public			0
he became a suspect after investigators found @entity91 evidence from the 2001 anthrax mailings on a flask used in his laboratory at the @entity96 , said a source who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly about the case			1
@entity5 had worked for decades in the biodefense lab at @entity46 , where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against the toxin			0
the @entity16 had traced the anthrax used in the attacks to the lab by using a new technology , a @entity76 official familiar with the investigation said			1
authorities were looking at whether @entity5 may have released anthrax to test a vaccine he was working on , another official said			1
some of the anthrax - laced letters , written in crude block letters , included the words , " @entity117 ( sic ) now , " according to photographs released by the @entity16			2
since @entity5 ' death , suspicions about his involvement in the anthrax attacks have surfaced alongside questions about his sanity			1
at the time of his death , the 62 - year - old scientist was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions			0
she accused him of having harassed , stalked and threatened her with violence			0
the woman told the court in her complaint that @entity5 had been treated at a mental health facility			0
@entity140 , another government scientist who was named by the @entity141 as a " person of interest " in the attacks , was never charged			0
he sued the department , which settled the case in june			0
the skepticism in scientific circles about the strength of the case against @entity5 heightens the importance of the government 's unveiling of its evidence against the scientist , a former prosecutor said			2
" i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury , " said @entity156			2
" and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr. @entity5 , they ought to see that as well			0
" @entity1 producer @entity167 contributed to this story .			0
