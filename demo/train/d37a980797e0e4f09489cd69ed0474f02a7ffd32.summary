-- cradling your heap of plastic , you approach the bins , hastily inspecting each item for the number molded on the bottom			0
plastic water bottles go in the bin for ones and twos , along with the milk jug			0
that was easy enough , but what about the water bottle caps ? trash			0
@entity17 take - out container ? @entity19 number six			0
canola oil container is labeled number three			0
annoyed and confused yet ? you 're not alone			0
the @entity25 reports only 7 % of plastic waste generated in 2009 was recovered for recycling			1
but , a discovery by @entity30 engineers could make recycling easier for you			1
a group of scientists at this @entity35 university has discovered a way to recycle 100 % of plastic			1
using pyrolysis , a technique in which heat is applied in the absence of oxygen to decompose materials , the university says it was able to break plastic down into its basic elements			0
the results could mean a significant reduction in pollution while scientists try to find a safer alternative to using plastic			1
" it will reduce the amount of plastic from being sent to landfills and / or incinerators , beautify our environments and create sustainable plastic products , " said environmental engineer @entity50 of @entity51			1
@entity60 business development manager @entity59 says the next step is to commercialize their findings			0
they will build their first plant in the near future			1
" there are currently no commercial recycling plants that can deal with domestic mixed plastic waste , so the system we are developing will be the first of its kind in the world , " @entity59 said			1
why could this be such a big deal ? the @entity25 spent more than $ 220 million on recycling and waste management in 2008 due to sorting , landfill management and other costly actions			2
the ability to recycle 100 % of plastic could remove the need to sort through materials and reduce the need to produce fresh plastic			1
" waste can be a valuable resource , " said @entity86 , an environmental engineer at @entity87			1
" we hear a lot of about ' waste - to - energy ' but little about ' waste - to - chemicals			2
' creating chemicals from waste could be more profitable than making energy			2
" since plastic is not biodegradable , it can not be broken down by microorganisms and remains in a landfill forever			0
@entity102 , executive director of @entity103 , a nonprofit environmental organization dedicated to reducing the use of plastics in society , says what people need to know is that many of the materials collected have a lot of potential value and are sold			2
by using the @entity30 's process to turn plastics into energy , she believes people will see the need to increase their recycling efforts			1
while temporary measures can be taken to reduce our plastic use , @entity86 said widespread use of this technology would decrease our dependence on fossil carbon and stimulate local economies			0
@entity126 , a chemist at @entity87 , offers a simple example to explain what he believes is the most important conclusion of the study : " consider the jug of liquid laundry detergent			1
... this jug could be reused for 10 years , but we typically throw it away after the laundry detergent is gone			0
... it 's the economy of convenience that leads to our current ' throw - away ' society ; this is ultimately not a sustainable way to utilize our resources or sustain our environment			0
" chemist @entity143 of the @entity144 says actions come with consequences : " advances in science led to the generation of wonderfully useful , versatile , lightweight and strong plastics that have myriad applications that bring benefit to society			2
now , we have to use the same ingenuity to appropriately deal with the plastic waste that is a consequence of the broad utility of these materials			2

@entity35 scientists say they *'ve* found way to recycle 100 % of plastics
@entity30 plans first commercial plant soon
" waste can be a valuable resource , " @entity87 engineer says
