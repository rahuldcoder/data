@entity18 tries to make life as normal as possible for his daughter , who is attending school for the first time in the @entity23 , having lived abroad since she was 2			1
but her heart remains in @entity9 , the place she 's come to regard as home			1
" i really like it here , but it would have made me feel better if we were in @entity9 because that 's where i want to be right now , " she says			2
" i want to go back really badly , but that does n't mean i do n't like it here			1
i just want to be able to say goodbye			0
" the @entity35 are among the many diplomatic families wait in limbo for word on when they can return to @entity9			2
@entity18 , an economic development consultant , says he is grateful to the @entity23 government for making the transition as smooth as possible in a community that has been welcoming and supportive			2
but it 's been more than a month since they left @entity9 and he 's anxious to resume the life he left behind			1
" we 've been living in @entity9 for four years			1
this is place is fine , but everything is there			0
we have a set of friends , we have a way of living , and all of that is disrupted			0
we have to adjust and do well , wherever you go , but you want to be at home			2

she has told them things are still tense in the @entity9 capital -- there 's still the occasional gunfire ; roadblocks are still up ; people are hesitant to go far from their homes			2
but life is slowly returning to normal , with 70 percent of schools up and running , including @entity1 's school , @entity76 , @entity18 says			1
@entity1 's room contains her most cherished mementos of the life she left behind : some stuffed animals , medals from her accomplishments as a swimmer , photos with her parents from their adventures in @entity87 and @entity88 -- where they lived prior to @entity9			1
she also brought along a small statue of @entity90 , the @entity9 pharaoh			2
" i do n't have a lot of statues of things , and it was small but it also reminded me of the @entity95 and how they lived through a lot of hard things , so i sort of related to them , " she says			0
she misses her friends , her teachers , and " all these amazing sights that most people are n't able to see			0
" but most of all , she says , she misses her mother			0
" it would have been easier for us all to adjust with my mom here because she sort of is the one who does a lot of things			0

my dad 's not a very good cook			0
" @entity18 says that , given the situation in @entity9 , he hopes to return sometime in the next month			1
