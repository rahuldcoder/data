the overall death toll in devastated @entity2 has surpassed an estimated 60,000 people , the @entity0 said wednesday , a dramatic figure that could skyrocket as the civil war persists			1
to put it in perspective : 60,000 people is roughly the population of @entity10 , @entity11 ; or @entity12 , @entity13			2
it 's how many people would fit in @entity16 , and it 's more than the 50,000 - plus @entity19 combat deaths in @entity20			2
the figure is about 15,000 higher than the death toll @entity23 had cited from a collection of sources			2
it 's " truly shocking " and shameful , said @entity28 @entity27 , who blamed the international community for inaction			1
" collectively we have fiddled at the edges while @entity2 burns , " she said			1
" while many details remain unclear , there can be no justification for the massive scale of the killing highlighted by this analysis			2
" inside @entity2 , anti-government activists brought their personal perspective to the new death estimate : " no wonder ! " @entity46 activist @entity45 said			1
" we live on the ground and we see the massacres daily			2
" western and @entity50 nations have denounced president @entity52 's regime , but they have been been reluctant to intervene in hopes of ending the warfare			0
what 's next for @entity2 in 2013 ? they have n't been successful in forging tough action against @entity2 at the @entity58 because of opposition from @entity60 and @entity61 , both of which have long had friendly relations with and economic ties to @entity66			1
while some countries have passed along weapons to the rebels , the larger world community has avoided being drawn into a war , fearing a bloody quagmire , such as the @entity73 for the @entity19 or the invasion of @entity75 for the @entity60			0
echoing the fears of @entity0 - @entity78 envoy @entity77 , @entity27 worried about more deaths " unless there is a quick resolution to the conflict			1
" " i fear thousands more will die or suffer terrible injuries as a result of those who harbor the obstinate belief that something can be achieved by more bloodshed , more torture and more mindless destruction , " she said			0
@entity27 said the number of deaths is higher than expected			1
" this massive loss of life could have been avoided if the @entity2 government had chosen to take a different path than one of ruthless suppression of what were initially peaceful and legitimate protests by unarmed civilians , " she said			1
" as the situation has continued to degenerate , increasing numbers have also been killed by anti-government armed groups , and there has been a proliferation of serious crimes including war crimes , and -- most probably -- crimes against humanity , by both sides			2
" the 60,000 , she said , " is likely to be an underestimate of the actual number of deaths			0
" citing the discovery of mass graves in newly liberated government bases , @entity45 , the activist , said : " the number i think is far greater than this , and lots of people are missing			0
" " the recording and collection of accurate and reliable data has grown increasingly challenging due to the conflict raging in many parts of the country , " @entity27 said			1
@entity129 , a @entity0 spokesman , agrees that the number " is probably a minimum " and reflects a killing field of war crimes			1
" there 's not a shadow of doubt now that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed			0
that said , in each individual case , the final judgment has to be made by a court			0
it 's hard to quantify at this point , " he said			0
" this is a classic case of a conflict that 's spiraling downwards , becoming ever more ghastly			0
we 've seen this before in the @entity151 and other places			0
the worse it becomes , the more difficult it is to resolve			0
" @entity155 , who posted a reaction on @entity23 's comment section , sees a dark future for @entity2 , regardless			1
" @entity2 is doomed , no matter who wins , the terrorist rebels or the terrorist regime , the country ... will take tens of years to rebuild , ' @entity155 wrote			1
" even if @entity52 is toppled in the next few months , sectarian fighting will still go on for years			0
" @entity164 , another @entity23 commenter , accused @entity167 and @entity50 nations of wanting to topple @entity52 at any cost			0
" i think the best bet for @entity2 now is to keep @entity52 as leader , " wimcorbijn wrote			1
" it is the right time for ( countries such as @entity176 , @entity60 , @entity177 , @entity61 and @entity178 ) to step in and support to help to defeat the rebels			0
once the rebels are defeated , they can force to introduce democracy as well as political reforms in @entity2			1
" air attacks , shelling , tank fire , bomb attacks , street - to - street fighting and sectarian fighting have all contributed to the rising toll , @entity27 said			1
deaths have increased from 1,000 a month in the summer of 2011 to more than 5,000 a month since july , she said			0
deaths have been most prevalent in @entity192 , the @entity66 outskirts , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity46			1
more than three - quarters of the victims are male , and 7.5 % are female , @entity27 said			2
the gender of the others is n't clear , and analysts could n't " differentiate clearly between combatants and non-combatants			0
" the inability of the @entity58 and the international community to stop the violence " shames us all , " she said			0
