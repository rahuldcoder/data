in recent years , social games have become increasingly prevalent on mobile devices , providing entertainment , yes , but also a way to maintain contact with family and friends			1
but for @entity8 , who 's legally blind , the visual displays used to play and chat meant they were off limits to her			1
@entity8 , 37 , is a mother of four from @entity12 , @entity13 , who has a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa			1
she can only see light and dark shapes and can not discern details			0
@entity8 said she has always enjoyed playing games with her family			1
however , she usually needed other people around in order to be able to play			0
after she got an @entity23 and @entity24 , she tried playing some of the downloadable games , but due to her visual impairment , she could n't find a game that she enjoyed and that allowed her to play with her friends			1
@entity8 uses the @entity30 accessibility program on her mobile devices to help her " see " what 's on the screen and interact with it			1
still , she said it was tough to find games that were compatible with the program			2
" i always get the free version ( of games ) to make sure it is @entity30 compatible , which is what makes the @entity23 and the @entity24 talk , " she said			1
" if it works , then i 'll get the paid version , but i need to make sure it works first			0
" that 's opened up some options			0
but only one game , she says , has let her both play and communicate with friends			1
" @entity54 " ( @entity55 ) is a word game that resembles @entity52 , but with a few twists			2
one player comes up with a word that another player tries to guess one letter at a time			0
get a letter wrong and the balloons holding up your avatar will start popping until there is nothing to save you from the lava pit below			0
the game , which debuted in july , is played one - on - one with anyone anywhere			0
@entity8 said " @entity54 " specifically works with @entity30 and lets her " see " what 's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing			1
" playing a game against the computer is one thing			0
but playing against real people is what makes it so much better , " she said			0
@entity79 , general manager of @entity55 , said they did n't intend to make a game for the visually impaired , but are pleased that their game can be enjoyed by people like @entity8			2
" it may seem silly to think that a game can change someone 's world , but why not ? " @entity79 said			0
" ' @entity54 ' was designed so that nearly anyone can pick it up and play and we are very happy and proud to welcome visually impaired players now as well			2
" @entity8 said there are other games that are @entity30 compatible , but they do n't allow for the social interaction that " @entity54 " does			1
she said she hopes more social games will embrace the @entity30 program so she can enjoy them with her family and friends			1
" ' @entity54 ' really was n't my type of game until i started playing it , " she said			2
" i would n't have even guessed that i 'd be so into that game before i started playing it			0
but i love this game			0
