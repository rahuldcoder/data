@entity0 -- tears flowed from dr. @entity4 's eyes wednesday as he listened to an elderly patient tell jurors that @entity4 had opened a clinic in the @entity9 community of @entity10 in honor of his father , who had practiced there			1
after 17 days of hearing about how pop star @entity16 died under @entity4 's care , jurors began hearing wednesday from people who say the doctor saved lives			1
@entity21 was one of five character witnesses called by @entity4 's defense lawyers wednesday morning as his involuntary manslaughter trial nears an end			1
" if this man had been greedy , he never would have come to an area , a community of @entity9 , 75 % of them poor , on welfare and @entity32 , " @entity26 said			0
@entity4 continued to dab tears from his eyes even after @entity26 left the stand			1
" he 's the best doctor i 've ever been to , " said @entity36 , a 68 - year - old former patient of the man accused of causing @entity16 's death			1
" and i just do n't think he did what he 's being accused of , " @entity36 added , under cross-examination by the prosecution			2
much of the prosecution 's case has been spent trying to demonstrate that @entity4 gave reckless and incompetent medical treatment as @entity16 's personal doctor in the last months of his life			1
@entity36 met @entity4 11 years ago when he was rushed to a @entity49 hospital with a heart attack , but they became friends since then , he testified			1
" it 's because of dr. @entity4 , the way he cares for you , the way he makes you feel , " @entity36 said			1
prosecutors contend that @entity4 abandoned his patients in @entity49 and @entity10 for the $ 150,000 a month @entity16 had promised him			1
" there 's no way , he 's not greedy , " @entity36 said			2
" he does n't charge me my deductable , never has			0
" @entity49 heart patient @entity63 , who followed @entity36 on the witness stand wednesday , said @entity4 " makes sure you 're ok during the procedure			1
" " that man sitting there is the best doctor i 've ever seen , " @entity63 testified			1
@entity4 treated @entity69 by putting 14 stints into arteries around his heart 11 years ago , @entity69 testified			1
" i 'm 66 , i 've gone to a lot of doctors , a lot of doctors and i 've never had one that gave me the care that he did , " @entity69 said			2
@entity4 never charged @entity69 beyond what his insurance would pay , he said			2
" i had a type of insurance that do n't hardly pay for nothing , " he said			0
" so he did it for me free			0
" two medical experts for the defense , including anesthesiologist dr. @entity88 , are expected to follow thursday and possibly friday			1
this would set the stage for closing arguments and jury deliberations early next week , although it 's possible that could come friday			2
@entity16 's sisters @entity96 and @entity97 , as well as his brother @entity98 , were in court for wednesday 's testimony			2
the promoter of @entity16 's ill - fated " @entity103 " tour testified tuesday that @entity16 's fear that producers would " pull the plug " on the shows if the singer missed more rehearsals was unfounded			2
" no one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug , " said @entity110 , the head of @entity110			0
@entity4 's lawyers contend @entity16 self - administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a " desperate desire to get to sleep , " because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his comeback concerts			1
if the tour was canceled , @entity16 would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs , @entity110 said , although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been			0
defense lawyer @entity130 estimated the cost to be about $ 40 million , leaving him " a very , very poor man , " but it was not while the jury was present			2
concert director @entity136 sent @entity110 an e-mail five days before @entity16 's death , referring to @entity16 's fear the company would cancel the tour			2
the e-mail triggered a meeting with @entity16 and @entity4 to address @entity136 's concerns about @entity16 's " lack of focus " and missed rehearsals , with the debut of his @entity146 shows just three weeks away			1
he and @entity136 were satisfied when @entity16 told them " you build the house and i will put on the door and paint it , " suggesting he would be ready , @entity110 testified			0
also at the meeting , @entity110 told @entity4 that he wanted to make sure @entity4 knew about @entity16 's visits to another doctor , dermatologist dr. @entity153			1
" because he 's his principal physician , i thought he should know , " he said			0
@entity110 said he was concerned because @entity16 " seemed a little distracted and not focused " in a meeting after a visit to @entity153 's @entity157 clinic			0
the defense contends @entity16 became addicted to the painkiller @entity159 in his frequent visits to @entity153 in the three months before his death			0
his withdrawal from the @entity159 , which @entity4 was unaware of , would explain why @entity16 could not sleep the day he died , the defense contends			1
earlier tuesday , a nurse who tried to treat @entity16 's insomnia with natural remedies testified that @entity16 told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored			0
@entity16 died two months after that conversation with nurse @entity172 , from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of propofol , combined with sedatives			0
prosecutors contend @entity4 's use of propofol to treat @entity16 's insomnia in his home was reckless , in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls			1
@entity186 's testimony was briefly delayed as she was overcome with emotion			0
" i 'm feeling really , really dizzy , " @entity186 said			0
" this is just very sensitive to me			0
" @entity186 used iv drips loaded with vitamins , " sophisticated " vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas to treat @entity16 's insomnia , but @entity16 became frustrated when her natural remedies failed to make him sleep , she said			0
" he said ' i 'm telling you the only thing that 's going to help me sleep right away is the @entity198 and can you find someone to help me to sleep ? ' " @entity186 said			0
@entity198 is a brand name for propofol			0
after some quick research , the nurse warned @entity16 that it was dangerous to use propofol at home , @entity186 testified			0
@entity16 was not deterred , she said , even after she asked him " but what if you do n't wake up ? " deputy district attorney @entity209 asked her , " and he responded , ' i will be ok , i only need someone to monitor me with the equipment while i sleep ' ? " " yes , that 's exactly what he said , " @entity186 said			0
@entity4 had already agreed to serve as @entity16 's private physician and had ordered his first supplies of propofol for @entity16 more than a week before @entity16 asked @entity186 for help getting the drug .			1
