@entity0 -- in what activists describe as unprecedented , the @entity3 archbishop in @entity0 has relieved a retired cardinal of his public and administrative duties for his mishandling of " painful and brutal " allegations of sexual abuse by priests			1
archbishop @entity12 of the @entity13 disciplined his predecessor , the now retired cardinal @entity14 , after a @entity16 judge forced the archdiocese to release about 12,000 pages of church documents revealing how it handled allegations of abuse			1
there were 192 priests and bishops named in litigation , the archdiocese said			2
" the cases span decades , " @entity12 said in a statement thursday			2
some go back to the 1930s			2
the documents were released on the archdiocese 's website			1
" but that does not make them less serious			2
i find these files to be brutal and painful reading , " he said			1
meanwhile , the @entity42 's @entity41 is reviewing the newly released set of documents , spokeswoman @entity40 said friday			1
no member of the @entity0 church hierarchy has been charged with any wrongdoing , she said			1
also on friday , @entity14 posted on his personal blog a response he sent to @entity12			1
the letter provides " the history and context of what we have been through since the mid- 1980s , " @entity14 said			1
when @entity12 began to take over the archdiocese in may 2010 , " you began to become aware of all that had been done here over the years for the protection of children and youth , " @entity14 wrote to @entity12			1
the archdiocese became " second to none " in such protection , he wrote			0
" not once over these past years did you ever raise any questions about our policies , practices , or procedures in dealing with the problem of clergy sexual misconduct involving minors , " @entity14 wrote			1
" i have stated time and time again that i made mistakes , especially in the mid- 1980s			0
i apologized for those mistakes , and committed myself to make certain that the @entity13 was safe for everyone , " he wrote			0
@entity12 cited @entity14 for serious shortcomings after victims came forward during his tenure			1
" effective immediately , i have informed @entity14 that he will no longer have any administrative or public duties , " @entity12 said in a statement			1
@entity82 , director of the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) , described @entity12 's decision as unprecedented , but it amounts to a mere slap on the wrist long after the fact			1
" i ca n't think of any instance in which a current @entity3 prelate -- and that would include bishops and cardinals -- restricted or , in this case , promised to restrict their predecessor , " said @entity82 , who has spent 24 years monitoring sex abuse allegations against priests			1
@entity82 said that between the ages of about 11 and 16 he was sexually abused by a priest in @entity99			1
" but to say to a retired employee that we 're going to give you fewer roles , it 's a symbolic gesture and a pretty hollow one at that , " @entity82 said			1
he should have been demoted or disciplined by the church hierarchy , in @entity111 and in the @entity112 , " he said			0
but @entity14 was not as much as denounced when he was in power , @entity82 said			1
@entity14 " expressed his sorrow " for the alleged abuse , which victims reported during his tenure as archbishop from 1984 to 2011 , the archdiocese said friday			1
but @entity82 feels that he and other church officials knew too much and did too little , and that there have not been enough consequences to deter future abuse or cover - ups			2
" if you successfully conceal your wrongdoing , you can keep your job , " @entity82 said			0
@entity14 has n't had administrative duties since his retirement in march 2011 , archdiocese spokesman @entity129 said			1
@entity14 , who will turn 77 later this month , can continue to celebrate the sacraments with no restrictions and can vote in conclave in a papal election until age 80 , @entity129 said			1
" he is reducing his public profile , which included numerous invitations in @entity16 and around the country to give guest lectures on immigration reform , on the church in the 21st century , etc. , " @entity129 said in an e-mail to @entity1			0
" he remains a priest in good standing , and a cardinal of the church			1
" at the same time , auxiliary bishop @entity148 , who 's the regional bishop of @entity149 and @entity150 in @entity16 , has resigned and " has also publicly apologized for his decisions while serving as @entity152 " in relation to the sex abuse cases , @entity12 said			2
" i have accepted his request to be relieved of his responsibility , " @entity12 said			0
@entity82 called the resignation " less noteworthy			0
" " eight to 12 bishops around the world have resigned because of these cases , " @entity82 said			0
on friday , @entity83 leaders and supporters who said they were victimized as children by priests called upon federal and local prosecutors to investigate the sexual abuse allegations in the church files			1
the activists also called upon silent victims to come forward and disclose additional sexual offenses			0
at a press conference outside the @entity173 of the @entity0 , the activists called thursday 's release of church files " incomplete			1
" @entity176 of @entity177 , @entity16 , said a priest abused him from age 10 to 15			2
on friday , he called for a congressional hearing			0
he accused the church of withholding documents , especially with the priest who abused him and priests who abused his friends			2
" we 've had congressional hearings for doping , " @entity176 told reporters			0
" but where 's our congressional hearing ? this has not only impacted @entity0 but it 's impacted the entire @entity112 and throughout the world			1
" @entity195 of @entity0 said he found no files relating to the priest who abused him			1
he described the church hierarchy as " corporate officers of a corporation			0
" " so far this is nonsense			0
these people have spent millions and millions of the faithful 's dollars to protect themselves , " @entity195 told reporters			0
" these people behaved horrifically , absolutely horrifically			0
" the released files include letters by underage male victims accusing priests of sexually abusing them			1
in one letter , a clergyman is described as " a very charismatic and much loved priest in the @entity219 community and people would never suspect of any wrongdoing , " a victim wrote			2
but when the victim was 17 years old in 1983 , the priest took the youngster to a mountain retreat near @entity227 in @entity16 , and when they took a break by a stream , the priest " gave me a hug and kissed me as if i were a woman , " the victim wrote			1
later , at the cabin , " as i stood looking at the pictures on the walls , he reached out and fondled me , " the victim wrote in a letter to a church official			0
the priest also " forced me to have sex " in a church rectory , a hotel and in a mobile home near @entity245 , @entity246 , that someone loaned the priest , the victim wrote			2
" while i felt forgiven by @entity250 , i still feel dirty , " the victim wrote			0
in the file of another priest -- the one whom @entity176 identified as his abuser -- the contents were largely newspaper clippings about the priest being accused of child molestation			2
the priest was in charge of the altar boy program at an @entity177 church			2
at the end of the last page of the priest 's file is a handwritten note stating : " @entity266 ( district attorney ) * 3/27/03 -- charged w / felony 25 counts of child molestation of 8 youths in late 70 's - early 80 's			2
" the archdiocese published the names of accused clergy in a 2004 report , but the release of thursday 's documents will allow the public to trace how the church handled the allegations			0
it may bring to light some cases in which accusations were kept under wraps and the accused were kept out of the sight of the law or accusers			0
the documents were evidence in 508 civil cases by sex abuse victims that were settled in one stroke in 2007			2
victims received $ 660 million in the landmark judgment			0
most of the documents were inner - church correspondences about accused clergy			0
the archdiocese fought to purge the names of the accused from the papers until thursday , when judge @entity300 ruled that they be made public by february 22			0
the church published them shortly after the ruling			0
there are 124 personnel files in total , 82 of which reveal sex abuse allegations against minors			1
the release " concludes a sad and shameful chapter in the history of our local church , " the archdiocese said			0
it warned that although the names of the abused have been deleted , some may recognize their cases			0
" we understand this experience may be a difficult one , " it said			0
@entity1 's @entity325 and @entity326 contributed to this report .			0

" not once over these past years did you ever raise any questions , " retired @entity14 tells successor
despite discipline , retired archbishop is " in good standing " and can vote for pope
@entity0 prosecutor is reviewing newly released files on priest abuse
discipline against archbishop is unprecedented but " meaningless , " activist says
