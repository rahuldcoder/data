@entity0 is dangerously close to crossing a line			0
not the line that leads to a missile attack on the @entity4 , but the one that separates being a rogue state from being a parody of a rogue state			1
@entity10 's bluster is as comical as its nuclear threats are implausible			1
this does not mean the @entity4 should take the threats lightly			2
as defense secretary @entity18 has explained , when a country with a big army and nuclear weapons starts getting reckless , it is irresponsible to dismiss the possibility that it would actually do something insanely self - destructive			0
but the bigger concern has to do with why @entity0 is rattling its saber			0
the reason may reflect more on the @entity4 than we care to acknowledge			2
it is possible that @entity0 is threatening @entity4 because it thinks that there is little cost in doing so , that the @entity4 is less likely to strike back than ever before			2
it may well be acting out a scene from one of those old @entity32 movies that @entity34 's father , the batty @entity33 , used to love			2
in those westerns , there was often a moment when some wannabe gunslinger , a crazy kid , challenges an old cowboy with a much bigger reputation			0
he does so to lift himself up			0
but he also does n't think the old guy has it in him to pull the trigger anymore			0
opinion : @entity0 is not suicidal if @entity4 's enemies think that we are shrinking away from crises , that rhetoric and nonintervention are now our standard operating procedure , that would indeed be worrisome			1
and the idea is not unknown in international circles			0
a senior @entity55 diplomat suggested to me several months ago that because the @entity4 has pulled out of @entity57 and is pulling out of @entity58 , and has been so reluctant to be drawn into @entity59 even as horrors and the regional threat mount there , @entity4 's enemies are starting to conclude we have " gone soft			1
" a former top @entity4 government official , a career guy who has served both @entity64 and @entity65 , told me he 's worried that president @entity66 is sending the message that he does n't believe in @entity69 's famous view of the @entity4 as " the indispensable nation			1
" what the @entity4 appears to be willing or unwilling to do is often more important to world affairs than what we actually do			2
more often than not , our posture is our policy			2
opinion : an accident , then war with @entity0 ? this does n't mean the @entity4 will make the world safer by adopting the recklessness of the first term of @entity85 's administration			1
that , too , produces unintended consequences			0
but we do have to be careful about how our sensible restraint translates into other languages			0
if situations such as @entity59 make us look too timid about needed intervention , it can be as dangerous and provocative internationally as when tin - pot troublemakers such as @entity34 bang the table and cry for attention			0
that said , when the kid in those old @entity99 tries to take out the fastest gun in the @entity101 , it usually ends badly for him			0
were @entity0 to misread @entity4 's restraint as a lack of resolve , it wo n't survive the response it triggers			1
@entity66 has shown that when the threat is most urgent he does not hesitate to act , whether it means deciding to double down in @entity58 , increasing the number of drone and special operations missions against terrorists , getting @entity112 or bringing down @entity113			1
@entity4 may not be as aggressive as it has been in the recent past , but @entity66 's record -- the surfeit of caution regarding @entity59 aside -- suggests it would be a fatal error to test this cool hand in the @entity120			1
opinion : @entity34 is not crazy @entity4 's troop and weapons movements in recent days are a welcome clarification to those who doubt the country will protect its national interests wherever they are actively challenged .			1

@entity129 : @entity10 's bluster comical and implausible , but it must be taken seriously
he says enemies may *mistakenly* believe @entity4 caution on intervention means it 's " soft "
he says more often than not , @entity4 posture is policy , but testing resolve would be error
@entity129 : @entity66 has shown that when threat is most urgent he does not hesitate to act
