@entity1 , @entity2 the attackers sped into a @entity2 town with grenade launchers -- their gunfire and explosions shattering the early morning calm			1
as terrified residents scattered into bushes in @entity13 town and surrounding villages , the gunmen unloaded motorcycles from their trucks and followed in hot pursuit			1
residents hid under scant brush			1
some sought refuge in their homes			1
many who tried to cross into neighboring @entity24 drowned while trying to swim through @entity24			2
by the time the weapons went quiet , local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people			2
that was january 3 , nine days ago			2
on monday , bodies still littered the bushes in the area			1
" it is still not safe to go and pick them up for burial , " said @entity33 , the chairman of the local government where @entity13 is located			2
no emergency crews will enter the villages where militants are still running amok , local authorities said			2
" @entity13 is not accessible because it is still occupied by @entity44 , " said sen. @entity42 of northern @entity43			2
the strategic @entity2 town borders @entity24 , giving the extremists better access to both countries			1
@entity44 has terrorized northern @entity2 regularly since 2009 , attacking police , schools , churches and civilians , and bombing government buildings			1
the @entity55 group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of @entity59 law across @entity2 , which is split between a majority @entity61 north and a mostly @entity64 south			1

the attacks started at dawn on january 3 and continued throughout the weekend , according to residents			1
" each new crime committed by @entity44 exceeds the last in brutality			0
this is a direct consequence of the environment of total impunity in which @entity44 operates			0
every time they get away with mass murder , rape and the enslavement of women and children , they are emboldened , " @entity92 , special envoy of @entity93 high commissioner for refugees , said in a statement			1
she urged the @entity103 and other nations to offer @entity2 help to " collect evidence and bring the perpetrators of these attacks to justice			1
" @entity109 called the massacre @entity44 's " deadliest act			0
" " if reports that the town was largely razed to the ground and that hundreds or even as many as 2,000 civilians were killed are true , this marks a disturbing and bloody escalation of @entity44 's ongoing onslaught , " said @entity112 , @entity2 researcher for @entity109			1
the @entity2 military said the description of the attack as " the deadliest " was " quite valid			1
" " the attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since january 3 should convince well meaning people all over the world that @entity44 is the evil all must collaborate to end , " it said			0
the misery is far from over			0
those who survived the attack and tried to swim to @entity24 are now stranded on @entity135 on @entity24			2
@entity137 authorities are asking the @entity93 to help relocate more than 1,000 of them			0
@entity139 , a native of @entity13 who was away during the attack , said those trapped there are dying			0
" ‎ i have been in touch with them on the phone , " he said			0
" they told me ‎ some of them are dying from lack of food , cold and malaria on the mosquito - infested island			1
" of the 30,000 people displaced during the attacks , 20,000 camped in @entity156 city			0
an additional 10,000 were being ferried from @entity157 , which is about 60 kilometers ( 36 miles ) from @entity13			0
@entity158 , a national security spokesman , said @entity2 troops are pursuing the militants			1
‎ " security forces have responded rapidly and have deployed significant military assets and conducted airstrikes against militant targets , " @entity158 said			0
" troops are engaged in operations to reclaim the area from the terrorists			2
" but @entity139 , the @entity13 native , said it 's not true			0
" from information we are receiving from residents nearby , not a single @entity2 soldier has shown up in @entity13 since it was seized by @entity44 , " he said			1
" it is all propaganda			0
" critics have accused president @entity179 's government of not doing enough to address the insurgency , which mostly affects opposition strongholds			0
@entity2 is holding presidential elections next month			1
last week , @entity179 launched his re-election bid in a raucous rally in @entity185			0
he did not say a word about the massacres			0
