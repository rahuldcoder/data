@entity0 , @entity1 -- almost as soon as it was announced that @entity7 had defeated @entity8 in the 2008 general election , most pundits -- and voters , for that matter -- assumed @entity10 would be the president 's opponent in 2012			1
and why not ? she did n't just breathe life into @entity8 's campaign but into the entire @entity15			1
up until then , the @entity15 was about as hip as a dot matrix printer			0
@entity10 represented a brand of conservative politics that was twitterable and has since been instrumental in the rise of the tea party			1
and in the view of many people , particularly liberals , she 's also a bit of an idiot			2
a botched @entity27 interview here , a " @entity30 " skit there , and since breaking into the national scene , countless gaffes and misstatements			0
and yet despite it all , her popularity remains relatively high , particularly among conservatives			0
recent polls all show the majority in her party do not want her to run , but those surveys do not mean people , her people , do not love her			2
so when she announced wednesday she was not running for the 2012 presidency , i 'm sure quite a few of her supporters were extremely disappointed			2
that was n't my reaction			0
i smiled , thinking @entity10 is n't dumb at all			1
in fact , she 's pretty smart			1
" my decision is based upon a review of what common - sense conservatives and independents have accomplished , especially over the last year , " her official statement read			2
" i believe that at this time i can be more effective in a decisive role to help elect other true public servants to office -- from the nation 's governors to congressional seats and the presidency			2
" in other words , she can continue to influence national politics without having to be responsible for actually making a decision			2
she can criticize with a broad brush without the burden of contextualizing her statements with detailed , alternate solutions			0
she 's like a performance artist whose opinions are rarely second - guessed , whose tongue is rarely censored			2
she 's rich and famous and essentially has no one to answer to			0
her persona is so mesmerizing that her daughter @entity75 , a mother at 18 , gets paid to talk about abstinence			0
we should all be as dumb as @entity10			1
seriously , why would she stop doing what she is doing to seek a thankless job , that pays poorly for the work that it requires ? why turn her back on a public life with little accountability to campaign for a public life in which every decision will be scrutinized			1
@entity7 swatted a fly on television one day back in 2009			0
the next day , @entity89 issued a statement asking him to be more humane to animals			0
why would anyone leave a world of hunting moose to enter a world in which killing a fly is worthy of a press release ? it just does n't make sense			0
@entity10 's critics will say she did n't run because she knew she would lose			1
i say she did n't run because of the chance she would win			0
@entity10 has been around the political scene enough to know it 's a whole lot easier flirting with running for president of the @entity108 than it is being president of the @entity108			1
that 's especially true today , thanks in part to her			0
you have a better chance of seeing a herd of unicorns grazing in front of the @entity119 than drama - free bipartisanship in the halls of @entity122			0
@entity7 's under fire for a slumping @entity108 economy as if he pointed it south or as if the rest of the planet is on solid financial footing			1
but @entity10 , who prides herself on being in touch with the heartland , knows @entity108 are typically not interested in those kind of sausage - making details			1
they just want to eat			0
so despite the fact it took decades for the country to create the environment that allowed millions of jobs to be ushered out the door , the honeymoon for a new face to turn everything around will be extremely short			0
in fact , whoever is elected president in the fall of 2012 will probably be raked across the coals for the high unemployment rate by spring of 2013			1
this is why @entity10 probably decided not to run for president months ago -- she was smart enough to know that while she can move the needle and copies of her book , the economy is a whole other beast			1
and dumping @entity153 under the guise of " not putting @entity153 through that " -- as she said in her resignation speech as governor -- worked on the state level , @entity10 would certainly lose every supporter she has if she tried to walk away from the @entity160 in similar fashion			1
when you 're loved by so many unconditionally , why risk being hated by everyone for no reason at all ? it just does n't make sense			0
bashing @entity10 's intellect may be a hobby for some people , but in saying no to the @entity160 , she showed once and for all , she 's no fool			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity173 : after @entity8 's loss , many assumed @entity10 would run in 2012
he says @entity10 's decision not to run for president is a smart move
whoever wins in 2012 will likely face a weak economy , and will take the blame , he says
@entity173 : @entity10 will still have a *platform* for her views and can live the life she wants
