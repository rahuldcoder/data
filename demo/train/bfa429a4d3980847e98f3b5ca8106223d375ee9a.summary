-- call it " occupy @entity2			1
" or , perhaps , " @entity2			0
" hoping to capitalize on frustrations with the social networking giant , not to mention some of the anti-corporate sentiment bubbling up on @entity7 and beyond , entrepreneurs have launched an upstart site called @entity9			1
the @entity11 , @entity12 - based startup wants to be everything that @entity2 and rival @entity14 are not -- and it has the manifesto and sassy @entity18 video to prove it			1
" i could n't wait to tell my story			0
i could n't believe that all this was free , " says an actress in the video , strutting through @entity23 city streets in an off - the - shoulder t - shirt with the words " @entity27 " scrawled on it			0
" but i never knew that i 'd be part of some damn puppet show -- that you thought you could own me			0
well , you ca n't own me ! " later , she confronts a guy in a @entity14 t - shirt and another hoodie - wearing character with a striking resemblance to @entity2 ceo @entity38			1
the video is part of a series of hype - building efforts , along with cryptic news releases promising a " secret project " and " social revolution , " that preceded tuesday 's limited launch			1
opened for invite - only beta testing on tuesday , @entity9 says it will offer an alternative to the privacy concerns some people have about using @entity2 or @entity53 's new rival network			1
@entity2 and @entity53 both collect information about users to tailor advertising to them			1
privacy concerns have cropped up over various features @entity2 has rolled out -- from mobile check - ins to integration with other websites that can make a user 's online behavior more public if settings are n't tweaked			2
@entity9 promises that , under its terms of use , all content will remain the property of the user			2
after signing up , an app lets users transfer photos and other info from @entity2 to the new site			1
" we worked hard for more than three years to research people 's needs and present them with a solution that will empower them , " @entity9 ceo and founder @entity76 said on the company 's website			0
" our mission is to emancipate social media and unleash people 's extraordinary potential			0
our -- not so covert -- mission is to spark a social revolution			0
" @entity76 said she had the idea for the site when her son wanted to join @entity2 and she read what she called the site 's oppressive terms of use			2
according to @entity100 , the site is bankrolled with about $ 2.5 million in investments from venture capitalists			0
and its business model for fighting the corporate social - media giants ? corporate sponsorships			2
the site will let users either pick a participating business ( presumably one they like ) to " sponsor " their page or pay a $ 2 annual fee for the service			0
through much of wednesday , after tech blogs began reporting on it , pulling up the @entity9 site delivered an " over capacity " message			2
@entity9 is n't the first startup that has hoped to capitalize on @entity121 sentiment			0
last spring , @entity122 raised $ 200,000 on crowd - funding site @entity124 to develop a decentralized networking site			1
but more than a year and a half later , only an unfinished alpha version has been rolled out and , last month , developers sent out a plea for more money to people who have already signed up			0
the question , of course , is whether there 's any appetite for yet another social networking platform in a landscape dominated by @entity2 , with its 800 million users , and to a lesser extent , @entity139			1
even @entity53 has struggled to pull users away from @entity2 where , despite complaints , users have appeared willing to deal with occasional privacy concerns in return for a convenient online hangout populated by all their friends			1
but if even a small percentage of those users choose to abandon ship for the " revolution , " it may be enough for @entity9 to declare victory .			0

new " @entity9 " social networking site lets users own their content
@entity12 - based startup wants to be everything @entity2 and @entity14 are not
video promoting the site calls @entity2 and @entity53 " *greedy* giants "
the question is whether users will leave for a site with fewer *fellow* users
