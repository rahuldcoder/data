-- broadcaster @entity2 ' patchwork skin has being losing pigment for 17 years			1
he 's gotten used to the constant stares when his work makeup is off ; he does n't even mind being asked about his varying skin tones			1
@entity2 laughs when he recalls one of his 6 - year - old daughter 's friends telling him he looked like a cow			0
after @entity2 explained he had vitiligo , the boy asked if they could play @entity14			1
" it 's not really the ignorance , " @entity2 said about the lack of awareness surrounding vitiligo			1
" it 's the malicious ignorance			0
" he remembers playing a " visual tennis match " with a man in his office			0
the man would stare at @entity2 , then as soon as @entity2 looked at him , the man looked away			0
they volleyed back and forth until @entity2 told him , " it 's ok if you want to look			0
" he went through what he calls an " angry spotted - guy " period when he would give menacing looks to those who stared at him			0
" eventually i said , ' that 's not me ' and would do the opposite , " he said			0
" i 'd give them the million - dollar smile that got me into my work in the first place and turn it into a conversation rather than a spectacle			1
" what 's vitiligo ? june 25 marks @entity41 , which is aimed at raising awareness about the incurable disease			1
@entity44 affects roughly 100 million people worldwide , according to the @entity46			1
it 's not contagious or fatal , but scientists do n't know exactly what causes it			1
" the body acts as if it 's allergic to its pigment cells , " said dr. @entity51 , a professor and dermatologist at @entity53			1
the pigment cells , also known as melanocytes , die or stop producing melanin , leaving patches of colorless skin all over a person 's body			1
@entity44 does n't discriminate , affecting people of all skin colors , but it is most noticeable in people with darker skin			1
@entity68 probably had the most well - known case of vitiligo ; rumor has it @entity68 wore a single glove to hide some of the splotches on his hand			1
@entity2 said he also , for a time , wore a single glove while reporting stories to cover his symptoms			0
though there is no cure for vitiligo , there are many treatment options that vary in effectiveness and cost			1
topical creams and ointments can repigment the skin , but @entity51 said this process can take years			1
laser treatments , which target affected skin areas with light therapy , can produce results in just a few treatments			1
these treatments work best in dark - skinned people and on the face			1
there are also some surgical treatments , " but sometimes the healing is not uniform so it can look like there 's scarring , " @entity51 said			0
vitiligo patients often struggle for years to find something that works for them			2
@entity51 says one of his colleagues at @entity105 has done great work in mapping the causes of vitiligo in the immune system			2
@entity51 believes better treatments will be available in the next decade or so that target the roots of the disease			2
getting past the stigma @entity2 wore makeup on his face anytime he was out of the house for nearly four years until he was no longer able to hide his vitiligo , he said			2
being a tv personality , he worried that he would lose his job if his bosses and co-workers found out about his condition			0
eventually he had to reveal it , and to his relief , it was n't an issue			2
" my bosses here at the time were always very supportive , " he said			0
" the conflict was within			0
" he now goes without makeup when he 's not working , but he still wears makeup on camera because his vitiligo is so visible he feels it distracts from the stories he reports			2
@entity44 is n't physically painful , but @entity51 emphasized it 's not strictly a cosmetic condition either			1
imagine every time you meet someone you have a disorder clearly on your face , " he said			0
" it 's really a psychological disorder			0
" @entity144 , who works with the @entity145 , said he 's watched his pigment disappear since he was 6			2
it started on his legs , then spread to his hands , face and neck			0
" it 's not as bad as on dark - skinned people , but still , kids see everything , " @entity144 said			2
like @entity2 , he senses that his vitiligo makes people uncomfortable -- on subways or elevators , strangers purposely avoid looking at the spots			1
@entity144 says he grew up with few resources to help him understand the condition or how to treat it			0
he helped found the @entity46 in 2010 and now works full - time to provide resources to medical professionals and those with the condition			0
@entity2 has written a book , " @entity170 , " and often speaks about his experience with vitiligo			2
he met one woman and her brother at a support group he started in @entity176 , which he says was the first vitiligo support group in the @entity178			2
the woman 's brother told @entity2 she had n't left the house in months because of her insecurities with the disease			1
" she said ' i do n't know how you do it , ' " @entity2 said			0
" there are lots suffering in silence , and i hope to be their voice			0
" @entity0 anchor battles her skin and wins			0
