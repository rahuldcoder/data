" it 's insulting when they say we 're going to disenfranchise the @entity2 , " @entity0 said of the law that requires voters to present an @entity10 such as a driver 's license , passport , utility bill or birth certificate to vote			1
the suggestion , @entity0 said , is " because we 're @entity2 we 're inept to get an @entity10			1
