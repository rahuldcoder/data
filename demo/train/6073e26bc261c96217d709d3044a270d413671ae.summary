@entity0 , @entity1 -- when the cell phone rang , the words " private number " flashed on the screen			0
@entity7 knew who was calling			1
the threatening , mysterious voice on the other end of the line had hounded her for almost four months			2
but this phone call had a starkly sinister tone			0
the man said something he 'd never said before			0
he was coming to pick up the 21 - year - old police chief at the station			1
" some people " wanted to see her , he said			0
the same day -- march 1 -- her mother spotted strange cars driving past the family 's home			0
@entity7 knew it was only a matter of time before they closed in			1
she called her husband and told him to grab their 1 - year - old son			0
four months after headlines around the world heralded her as the " bravest woman in @entity34 , " @entity7 plotted a hasty escape across a remote border crossing in @entity1			1
terrified of being tortured or killed , she fled the country without packing a suitcase			0
with her parents , sisters , husband and son , @entity7 crossed a footbridge into the @entity43 and asked for asylum			1
" i came here for the security my country can not provide for me , " she told @entity2 in a recent interview			0
" the fear will never go away			2
what i experienced is a fear that will last a lifetime			1
" a few days after she left @entity34 , @entity7 learned her mother 's house had been ransacked			1
she is hiding in the @entity43 while she awaits a ruling in her asylum case , and agreed to speak with @entity2 in @entity0 , @entity1			0
the asylum process is a lengthy legal road that could take up to three years , @entity0 attorney @entity59 said , and there 's no guarantee @entity43 authorities will grant the request			2
but @entity59 said one thing is certain : going back to @entity34 would be a death sentence			0
" i have no doubt she will be killed , " said @entity59 , who calls @entity7 " the @entity66 of @entity34			1
" " she is a trophy for the cartels			0
she represented the average person saying , ' no more , ' " he said			1
last october , @entity7 took a job no one wanted			1
she became police chief in the small @entity34 border town of @entity77			1
the previous police chief had been murdered			1
drug cartel assassins cut off his head			0
nationwide , the @entity34 government says there have been more than 34,600 drug - related deaths since president @entity84 began a crackdown on cartels in december 2006			0
@entity77 , located only about 35 miles away from @entity87 , is in a region that has seen some of the bloodiest conflict , as rival cartels fight over smuggling routes into the @entity43			1
the idealistic criminology student 's rise to police chief in one of @entity34 's most violent areas thrust @entity7 into the international spotlight			1
news reporters from around the world came to @entity77 , a town of only 3,000 people , to tell the story of the woman who dreamed to make a difference			1
" we had a beautiful idea			0
that 's why i accepted the job , " @entity7 said			1
" we wanted to re-establish people 's confidence in the police			2
" but just weeks into her new job , the threatening phone calls started , @entity7 said			1
at first , the man on the phone tried to convince her to work for both sides			0
to many public officials in @entity34 , it is a familiar offer , commonly referred to as " plata o plomo " ( silver or lead ) -- a not - so - subtle demand to accept the drug cartel 's bribes , or be on the receiving end of bullets			0
@entity7 refused the offers for months			1
knowing she could not take on the drug cartels with her tiny police force , her mission at the police department was focusing on prevention			2
she hired 13 female police officers			2
they refused to carry weapons and the young police chief never used body guards , unlike many other public officials in @entity34			1
" yes , there is fear , " @entity7 told @entity2 shortly after she started the job			1
" it 's like all human beings			0
there will always be fear , but what we want to achieve in our municipality is tranquility and security			2
" her vision was training the police force to focus on pushing children to stay in school and helping single mothers find steady - paying jobs			2
it was a lucrative offer in a town full of women widowed by the drug war , where many families were scrambling to survive			2
@entity7 hoped the same circumstances that made so many young people fall prey to drug cartels ' offers of making easy money would bolster her police force 's success			1
" we were helping the people they ( the cartels ) were recruiting from , " @entity7 said			1
" i do n't think they liked that			0
we were trying to help them make a better life			0
" but perhaps naively , @entity7 said , she did n't expect to be run out of her hometown by the narco underworld			1
" i thought we made it clear to the drug cartels , we were going to be focused on social issues , " said @entity7			2
" we were n't going to attack them			0
that was the job of the state and federal police			2
" but the threats kept coming			0
eventually , @entity7 became so frightened that she asked her father to drive her to work			2
now , she fights back tears as she acknowledges that she can never return to the only place she 's ever lived -- a violent , corrupt world where many of her friends and family remain			0
" my whole life was in @entity34 , " @entity7 said			2
" i hope @entity34 becomes what it once was , a safe , fun place with life			0
" @entity7 is devastated that she ca n't go home , and disappointed she could n't finish her three - year term as police chief of the small town where she was born and raised			1
but still , she 's proud of her accomplishments			0
" we at least made a difference , gave people a little hope , " she said .			0

@entity7 says threats forced her to leave , gave her " fear that will last a lifetime "
she was police chief for four months in the border town of @entity77
her idealism drew international attention
