-- you might think the @entity2 was debating a bill about the politically influential @entity5 brothers over the last two days -- various @entity7 senators criticized them more than 20 times on the floor as they decried the influence of money in politics			1
" we 've witnessed the @entity5 brothers trying to buy @entity17 -- untold millions hoping to get a government that will serve them and make them more money , " senate majority leader @entity13 , @entity14 , said tuesday			1
" how many individual donations does it take to get the same time to present your case as the @entity4 ' spending , say , $ 3 million ? " asked sen. @entity21 , @entity22			1
what 's at stake in the 2014 midterms ? but the debate , which resumed wednesday , is on a proposed constitutional amendment allowing broader regulation of campaign finance and reversing the @entity35 's ruling permitting unlimited election spending by businesses			1
after several years of attacks by various @entity7 , allies of the billionaires @entity40 and @entity5 , who had in past years rarely publicly contest critics , are now fighting back against criticism aimed at them			1
and they 're trying to going on offense			1
who are the @entity5 brothers ? " it is imperative we speak out , that i speak out ... to set the record straight , " @entity47 , senior vice president and general counsel for @entity49 , told @entity0			1
the brothers ' business is centered on @entity49 , a major privately held conglomerate of companies producing fuel , paper , chemicals , electronics and fertilizer products			1
it employs 60,000 people in the @entity17 opinion : the truth about the @entity5 agenda several of the politically active organizations affiliated with the @entity67 , such as @entity68 , @entity69 , are major players on the @entity72 side			1
these nonprofit groups are controversial because they do n't have to disclose the names of their donors or the amounts of their gifts because they are classified as tax - exempt			2
how much the @entity67 themselves have given to them is unknown			2
it has been estimated these groups , which are some of @entity72 ' biggest boosters , could spend $ 290 million on television ads this year			2
according to a recent study from the nonprofit @entity84 , a group of six entities linked to the @entity67 aired 43,900 tv ads this election cycle -- nearly one out of every 10 spots -- signifying their prominence			2
@entity47 said how these groups operate is similar to how more liberal - oriented ones do , highlighting an organization called the @entity93 , which supports major groups in the progressive movement			2
" we are not going to back down , " @entity47 said			0
" i want to make sure people understand the hypocrisy by the @entity7			0
" " i respect their rights not to disclose , " @entity47 added			0
" the @entity93 and many of the groups supported by it also do n't have to disclose their donors because of how they are organized through the tax code			0
one difference , however , is the alliance does not directly give money to @entity7 - aligned groups it supports , including the @entity111 , @entity112 and the @entity113			0
a requirement of alliance membership , however , includes giving at least $ 200,000 to entities it supports			0
a chart being circulated on @entity119 among conservatives detailing the reach of the @entity93 was provided to @entity0 by a conservative activist involved in campaign strategy			1
according to the alliance 's spring investment booklet , first reported by @entity129 , the 21 groups at the core of its portfolio intend to spend $ 200 million this year to help support candidates and agenda priorities			0
the alliance estimated that $ 39 million of that would come from alliance donors , with the rest coming from other supporters			0
" they are spending more			1
they are doing more , " @entity47 told @entity0 speaking of some of the groups on the left supported by the @entity93 , such as @entity141 , which advocates on the makeup of appellate courts , and pushed for changes in @entity2 filibuster rules regarding judicial nominations			0
he said he does n't " think it is going to stop any time soon			0
" @entity149 , president of the @entity93 , disputed that assertion			0
" while we appreciate the @entity4 ' backhanded compliments that our network is better coordinated and more effective , the real difference is this : @entity93 donors will probably always be outspent by our counterparts on the right , but we are having a greater impact because our vision aligns with @entity17 values , " @entity149 said in a statement to @entity0			0
" @entity163 ) members are wealthy individuals and families who are trying to end the corrupting influence of money in the world and advance a world in which one person 's vote counts for more than their bank account			0
" organized labor launches " @entity175 " campaign as @entity176 nears -- and the @entity7 attacks on the @entity67 surely intensify -- @entity47 , who has granted interviews to several major media outlets this week , including the @entity180 and @entity0 , promised to talk to as many people as possible to spread his message about the hypocrisy he sees coming from the left			1
@entity0 political producer @entity185 contributed to this report .			2

a debate over *restrictions* on campaign spending turns into a debate about the @entity5 brothers
@entity40 and @entity5 have contributed millions to conservative causes
a @entity5 *spokesman* says they 're doing the same things that the *opposition* is
