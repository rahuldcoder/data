-- the @entity2 company @entity1 claims it has found the wreckage of a plane in the @entity5			1
the company is not saying that what they found is missing @entity8 , but it is urging official searchers to take a look			1
so far , @entity12 officials say they are investigating the credibility of the claim , while @entity2 searchers and a satellite company say they are confident that the plane is in a different area			1
what is @entity1 ? @entity1 specializes in geophysical surveys			1
the company 's technology has been used to find oil and gas , groundwater , uranium , even diamonds			2
the technology the company uses was originally created to search for nuclear , biological and chemical weaponry under the ocean or beneath the earth in bunkers , said @entity33 , the company 's director			2
" subsurface exploration has never been so precise -- we detect the nuclei of targeted substances , " the company says on its website			2
in addition to finding natural resources , the company has also used its resources to located submerged structures , including ships and aircraft			2
what technology is the company using ? according to an @entity2 newspaper account , @entity1 makes use of former @entity53 defense technology that has since been demilitarized			1
it analyzes super-weak electromagnetic fields captured by airborne multispectral images			0
" and what we do is we look at the nuclei of an atom , copper or nickel or iron			0
and so we knew we had the tools to search for the plane , " @entity33 said			0
for their search of @entity8 , the company began by looking for aluminum , which makes up about 70 % of the @entity68 , @entity33 said			2
once it got a hit for aluminum , it looked for other metals such as titanium , copper , steel , nickel , iron and chromium , he said			0
the result is a set of images that show what could be the parts of an intact plane			0
where is this site ? @entity33 declined to give the precise coordinates for @entity1 's find , but said it was about 120 miles ( 190 kilometers ) south of @entity90 in the @entity5			1
the search officials do have the exact location , he said			0
the current official search area is in the southern @entity94 , and is being coordinated by the @entity2			1
the site where @entity1 says it found the wreckage is several thousand miles away in an area that was ruled out weeks ago			1
@entity33 said his company began searching that area at a time when search efforts were in the @entity5			1
the search moved on , but his team sent their findings to officials repeatedly , he said			0
did officials ignore the company 's findings ? according to @entity1 , yes , its e-mails and phone calls to the official searchers went unanswered			1
that is one of the factors that pushed the company to release its findings publicly			2
@entity33 says he did not want to share the findings publicly at first , but it was possibly the only way to get heard			0
" we 're a large group of scientists , and we were being ignored , and we thought we had a moral obligation to get our findings to the authorities , " he said			0
the strategy appears to have worked , according to @entity33			0
on the same day he released the findings , @entity12 officials reached out and listened to a 1Â½ - hour technical presentation by his team			0
@entity12 acting transportation minister @entity128 said @entity12 " is working with its international partners to assess the credibility of this information			0
" @entity2 's @entity133 , which is leading the multinational search , dismissed the claim			1
the officials are " satisfied " with data that show the plane likely is in the southern @entity94 , and not in the @entity5			1
@entity0 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
