three numbers to keep in mind tuesday night as president @entity2 delivers his @entity4 address : six , 30 and 43			1
six as in the number of seats @entity7 need to gain this november to take control of the @entity9			1
30 : the historical average of @entity12 seats gained by the other party -- in this case the @entity7 -- in a two - term president 's " six - year itch " midterm election			1
and 43 % , of course , is @entity2 's job approval rating -- a reminder that his political standing is weak , though up slightly from its recent low point , as he stands before a closely divided @entity23 -- and country -- to lay out his agenda for year six of his presidency			1
" one of the greatest powers a president has is the power to set the agenda , " said veteran @entity28 strategist and wordsmith @entity27 , a close adviser to former president @entity31			0
" he ( @entity2 ) will use that power to great effect in the @entity4			1
" here 's how we see the @entity4 another @entity41 veteran disagreed , arguing this president is too weakened and the 2014 campaign landscape too troublesome to seize the initiative			2
" @entity4 means nothing , " this @entity45 said , speaking only on condition of anonymity			0
" re-read last year 's address			1
how relevant was it last year in terms of how 2013 turned out ? " in fact , @entity2 failed to get any of his top 2013 @entity4 priorities through @entity23			1
@entity23 ignored his calls for a new jobs program , for new gun controls and for sweeping immigration reform			0
because of that , the 2014 speech is viewed by strategists in both parties as part of a defining test : can @entity2 rebuild his standing enough to force action on some of his priorities , or will 2014 instead be remembered as another frustrating year of gridlock and the gateway to " lame duck " status ? to that end , many see this speech -- this wish list -- as potentially his last chance for significant action			1
8 memorable @entity4 moments " at this stage of a presidency , a @entity4 address can not be expected to have much , if any , consequence in terms of public opinion , " said leading @entity7 pollster @entity78			1
despite all the attention , @entity78 called the speech " an ephemeral event that is perhaps a short - term focus of the ultimate @entity89 policy insiders			0
" as always , the @entity4 is a policy address , a chance for the president to lay out his wish list to the @entity23 and the @entity95 people			1
but it is always a political stage as well , a dramatic nationally televised theater for the president to frame his argument			0
this year , even as he asks @entity23 to act on economic and other initiatives , president @entity2 will distance himself from an unpopular @entity23 and promise to use executive powers to implement some of his priorities			1
the stakes are enormous : as the president delivers his speech , the odds -- and the early election year data -- suggest @entity7 will not only keep their @entity12 majority but also have a good chance to capture control of the @entity9			1
how would complete @entity7 control of @entity23 alter the final two years of the @entity2 presidency ? it is a debate worth having , yet one that can wait a bit , as we first test whether the president has better luck with @entity23 in 2014 than he did in 2013 , and whether he can bend the political climate back more in his favor			1
@entity124 : @entity2 playing a weak hand at @entity4 which is where those numbers come in			1
the @entity12 says its no. 1 political goal this year is protecting the @entity28 majority in the @entity9			1
yet that goal -- blocking republicans from a net six - seat gain -- could significantly complicate the president 's policy agenda			0
several of the most vulnerable @entity9 @entity28 incumbents are from states @entity2 lost badly in 2012 : @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 to name three			1
those and other @entity28 are opposed to some things the president wants -- like new gun controls -- and in favor of ideas the @entity12 is against , including modifications to the president 's health care law			2
@entity150 : six ways to fight inequality @entity27 acknowledges the tough political environment facing the president			0
but he says he can navigate it with a smartly crafted 2014 @entity4 wish list			0
" how can he help red - state democrats running in places where he lost badly ? " @entity27 said			0
" by raising issues that play well in places he does n't			0
so you will hear a lot about middle - class economics : raising the minimum wage , extending unemployment insurance , pay equity and workplace fairness for working women , greater access to child care for working moms , pre-k for young kids and college aid for young adults			0
" the @entity12 @entity7 majority opposes most of the president 's ideas , though there have been some discussions testing whether compromises can be reached on the minimum wage , unemployment insurance and , from time to time , even immigration policy			1
the historical average for a two - term president 's party in this sixth year midterm is a loss of 30 @entity12 seats			2
even the most optimistic @entity7 view that as unlikely , given the shrinking number of competitive @entity12 districts			2
but @entity7 flexibility in policy discussions could depend on their own november midterm calculations , and at the moment top party strategists predict @entity7 gains in the high single digits on the @entity12 side			2
@entity7 say @entity2 has a lot of explaining to do " they will oppose his popular economic agenda at their own political peril , " @entity27 said , holding out hope the president would have an opportunity either to score policy successes or bend the political momentum back in his favor			2
the 43 % number is the one worth watching as the year unfolds -- midterm elections are shaped most by the president 's standing			0
if @entity2 can climb closer to 50 % , @entity28 chances improve significantly			0
if he slips closer to 40 % or below , then a @entity7 takeover of the @entity9 becomes more and more likely			2
a little history : in 2006 , president @entity217 had an identical 43 % job approval rating at the time of his @entity4 address			0
there was little fear of the president in @entity23 then , in either party , and as a result little of his agenda was enacted -- immigration and @entity229 changes were among the goals @entity217 laid out			0
come november 2006 , republicans lost 30 @entity12 seats , and their majority			0
7 things you did n't know about the @entity4 @entity31 , on the other hand , had a 59 % approval rating to begin his sixth year in office , and @entity239 was at 64 % around his 1986 @entity4			2
@entity28 defied the historical averages in the @entity31 " six - year itch " election ; republicans actually lost five @entity12 seats , and the @entity9 balance of power was unchanged			1
in 1986 , then - majority @entity28 made only modest gains in the @entity12 ( plus five seats ) , but did pick up eight @entity9 seats to take control of that chamber			2
outside of @entity89 , observers like @entity252 @entity7 activist @entity251 see an opportunity if the president " acknowledge ( d ) at the outset that overwhelmingly @entity95 share a common belief -- @entity89 does not work			0
he should acknowledge that both parties share that blame ; both are responsible			0
" @entity251 's advice ? " he needs to listen to the mood of this country and understand that folks do not want to hear a partisan harangue but rather want a strong message of leadership and cooperation from the man they elected to do just that			0
" and @entity251 's election - year @entity4 prediction : " he will do nothing of this sort			1
" @entity2 to raise minimum wage for federal contractors			0

@entity2 failed to get any of his 2013 @entity4 priorities through @entity23
many see this year 's speech as potentially his last chance for significant action
early election data shows @entity7 keeping @entity12 majorities , with good chance to win @entity9
