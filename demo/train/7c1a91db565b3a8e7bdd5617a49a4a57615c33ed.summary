@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 said thursday that " the scale and the scope " of his economic plan is right , turning up the heat on critics he said were hawking " phony arguments " and " false theories of the past " to chip away at the bill 's programs			1
president @entity3 said if a stimulus bill is n't passed the economy will continue to get worse			1
" do n't come to the table with the same tired arguments and worn ideas that helped to create this crisis , " the president said at the @entity19 @entity18 ' annual retreat in @entity0			1
" we 're not going to get relief by turning back to the very same policies that , for the last eight years , doubled the national debt and threw our economy into a tailspin , " he said			1
" we ca n't embrace the losing formula that says only tax cuts will work for every problem we face , that ignores critical challenges like our addiction to foreign oil , or the soaring cost of health care , or failing schools and crumbling bridges and roads and levees			1
" i do n't care whether you 're driving a hybrid or an suv -- if you 're headed for a cliff , you 've got to change direction			2
" the @entity18 welcomed the president with frequent interruptions for applause as he took on criticisms of the bill			1
@entity3 said he valued " the constructive criticism and healthy debate that 's taking place around this package , " but added that speedy passage of the bill was essential			1
" we 're not moving quickly because we 're trying to jam something down people 's throats , " he said			1
" we 're moving quickly because if we do n't , the economy 's going to keep getting worse			1
" @entity3 rejected calls for more tax cuts and significant slashing of the bill 's more than $ 800 billion price tag , and said complaints the package was a spending bill rather than a stimulus bill were off base			1
" what do you think a stimulus bill is ? " he said			2
" that 's the point			2
" to critics who argue that the government should n't be spending billions with a large and growing deficit , @entity3 said , " i found this national debt doubled , wrapped in a big bow waiting for me as i stepped into the @entity80			1
" the @entity82 people called for change in november , he said , " and that 's what we 're going to deliver			1
" " they did not send us here to get bogged down with the same old delay , the same old distractions , the same talking points , the same cable chatter , " he said			0
" they did not vote for the false theories of the past , and they did n't vote for phony arguments and petty politics , and they did not vote for the status quo			0
" @entity3 told his fellow @entity18 that they have " the capacity to do great things " on behalf of the @entity82 people , " but we are going to have to do it by not thinking about ourselves			1
" " it starts with this economic recovery plan , " he said			0
" and soon , we will take on big issues like addressing the foreclosure problem , passing a budget , tackling our fiscal problems , fixing our financial regulation and securing our country			0
" but , he stressed , the battle over the stimulus bill is not " an abstract debate			2
" " if we do not move swiftly to sign [ the act ] into law , an economy that is already in crisis will be faced with catastrophe , " he said			1
" this is not my assessment			0
this is not @entity121 's assessment			2
this is the assessment of the best economists in the country			0
this is the assessment of some of the former advisers of some of the same folks who are making these criticisms right now			0
" " this is not a game , " he said			0
" this is not a contest for who 's in power and who 's up and who 's down			2
" it 's time , he said , to " set aside the gamesmanship in this town and get something done			2
" behind closed doors after his speech , @entity3 fielded a handful of questions from @entity19 democrats			1
asked about @entity150 , @entity3 pointed to a number of reviews under way -- including ones by his national security team and by the @entity156 -- of @entity82 strategy in @entity150			1
the @entity82 can not win there by military means alone , @entity3 said			1
he stressed the need to make sure that @entity150 does not become a safe haven for terrorists			0
the president highlighted the importance of diplomatic efforts in @entity166 as well			0
on the subject of fiscal discipline , @entity3 referred to the economic stimulus package , getting credit going again so small businesses can get loans , stemming home foreclosures with next expenditure of the @entity175 , and the executive compensation limits his administration set this week for businesses that accept taxpayer bailouts			1
asked whether he would lift the ban on stem cell research , the president promised to sign an executive order to do so			0
@entity3 said he wants to coordinate with @entity19 and @entity185 leadership to craft an executive order - based on science , fact and reason -- strong enough to avoid a quick reversal			1
@entity3 's comments impressed rep. @entity192 , @entity193			1
the president " said he 'd rather do what 's right and serve one term than just do what 's politically good and be a mediocre president and get to serve two terms , " @entity192 said			2
@entity192 , a fiscal conservative , said he did n't support every program in the @entity19 bill			0
" we could n't explain some of them , " he said			0
for instance , " how does giving out condoms put people back to work ? " but @entity192 criticized republicans who focused on only a small fraction of the stimulus bill , calling it " chump change			2
" he acknowledged that although a stimulus package might not work , he said @entity214 needs to act or risk " total collapse " of the economy			2
@entity19 majority leader @entity217 of @entity218 praised republicans who voted with @entity18 and said they showed true bipartisanship			0
but he railed against the @entity219 leadership , which told its members to vote against the original stimulus bill			0
" now they seem to be fired up and ready to say ' no , ' @entity217 said			0
" we hope that they will change their minds			0
" @entity219 have blasted numerous measures in the $ 819 billion stimulus package that the @entity19 passed last week , such as funding for veterans in the @entity232 and sod on the @entity234			0
such provisions have nothing to do with stimulating the economy , @entity219 say			0
@entity217 acknowledged a need for compromise on some points important to the @entity242 leadership , but he declined to specify what he 'd be willing to sacrifice to get the bill passed			0
@entity2 's @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			0
