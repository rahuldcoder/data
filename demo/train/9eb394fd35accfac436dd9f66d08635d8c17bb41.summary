@entity1 's ambassador to the @entity20 estimated monday that the death toll was about 2,000			1
but @entity29 stressed the number of casualties is uncertain			2
" i think the honest answer is that we do n't know , " he told reporters			2

@entity120 said imposition of a no - fly zone is under consideration , but @entity117 said doing so would be " an extraordinarily complex operation			0
" a top @entity20 general said tuesday that any effort to establish a no - fly zone over the country would include eliminating @entity1 's air defenses			1
it would be " challenging , " @entity131 leader gen. @entity130 told the @entity133			0
in western @entity1 , @entity91 said , there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents			1
he noted " allegations of extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions and torture			0
" though more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition , @entity4 's supporters " appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country , chiefly @entity0 , " he said			1
he warned of " serious indications " that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages			0

@entity91 called for immediate action by the international community			0
" time is of the essence , " he said			0
" thousands of lives are at stake			0

some said they had been threatened with death			0
one man said @entity1 soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $ 500 from him			1
when he told them he did n't have it , they said , " die then " and threw him into the street			0
@entity163 authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees			0
volunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds			0
" there is nothing for them on that side , " a policeman turned volunteer said from the @entity163 side of the border			0
he was one of many @entity163 donating their time to take food , water and supplies to the border			0
many said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving			0
meanwhile , more parts of the regime have broken off , joining calls for @entity4 to halt the violence			0
in @entity211 , the @entity1 @entity210 said it was siding with the opposition , condemning what it called " all acts of murder and terror " taking place in @entity1			1
the military situation on the ground was complex : forces loyal to @entity4 tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled , an opposition leader in the town told @entity2 tuesday			1
the source said @entity114 troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked @entity230 from east and west at nightfall monday , but did not capture the town			0

the officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution , but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas @entity4 has lost			0
@entity230 was calm tuesday , but @entity4 's troops remained nearby , the opposition leader and another source in the town said			1
@entity2 is not naming them to protect their safety			0
@entity238 was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on tuesday was stable , said @entity259 , who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council			1
pro-gadhafi forces are stationed in the @entity266 college about 15 kilometers ( nine miles ) outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall , he said			0
the forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city , but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and " to terrorize the people " by opening fire on them			0
at least two farmers were killed monday when these forces shot at their vehicle , @entity277 said			0
still , some semblance of normalcy was visible tuesday , when some banks had reopened in @entity238 and people were able to withdraw money or get loans , he said			1
food supplies were ample , he said , but medical goods were scarce			0

some residents told @entity2 they want to protest but fear being killed			0
@entity299 , the leader 's 38 - year - old son who has spoken on behalf of the regime during the protests , told @entity2 his talks with the opposition are in " chaos " because the opposition is divided , with no clear leaders			1
many @entity1 have rejected the younger @entity4 's remarks during the uprising			1
but @entity20 officials made similar comments about the rebel forces			1
a @entity20 official who wished to remain nameless because the official was not authorized to speak on the record said it 's " unclear who the leaders in the opposition are and that makes it difficult " for the @entity20 to provide assistance			1
" the intelligence community is aggressively pursing information on the ground , " said the official , who added that the @entity323 has had a presence in the country for some time			0
" i think it remains to be seen how effectively military leaders who have defected from @entity4 's forces can organize the opposition in the country , " said @entity29			1
" we are watching that unfold			0
" over the past two weeks , government forces have repeatedly clashed with demonstrators and rebel forces , fired on crowds and at times shot indiscriminately at people in the streets , numerous witnesses have told @entity2			0
the elder @entity4 made no public appearances tuesday , but he appeared out of touch on monday , denying having used force against his people and even denying the existence of the protests			0
" no demonstration at all in the streets , " the 68 - year - old ruler told @entity351 and the @entity352 in a joint interview in @entity0			0
" they love me , all my people with me , they love me all			0
they will die to protect me , my people , " said @entity4 , who has controlled @entity1 for nearly 42 years			1
but @entity1 's deputy u.n. ambassador @entity359 disagreed			1
" i do n't believe that even his family loves him at this moment , " said @entity359 , who has joined the rebel movement in calling for @entity4 to step down			1
" i think no one loves him at all			2
i think the whole @entity1 people hate him now			1
with all the bloodshed , all the killing ... he 's certainly out of his mind			2
" @entity2 's @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 , @entity375 , @entity376 , @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 and @entity380 contributed to this report			2
