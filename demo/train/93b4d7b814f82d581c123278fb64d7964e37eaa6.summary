-- you know that a news story has broken through , as we like to say in the journalism business , when @entity5 and @entity6 start playing it for laughs			0
in the last few weeks , the dynamic duo of @entity10 has had a field day with the subject of super pacs , those fundraising machines that can raise unlimited donations to fund political ads , provided that they are not officially affiliated with a specific candidate			1
when @entity5 launched his mock run for " @entity20 of @entity21 , " @entity6 came on his show to announce that he would head up the " definitely not coordinated with @entity23 , " swearing that it would have no ties to the friend whose hand he was holding on the set			0
it 's become an easy talking point that this will be the most expensive presidential race in history , and that super pacs could tip the outcome			1
but in a special in depth series of reports , @entity0 will take a hard look at that conventional wisdom -- exploring what super pacs are , what they do , who funds them , and how much power they really have			1
these special reports will air daily this week across all our prime - time and daytime television shows -- including " @entity45 with @entity46 , " " @entity47 , @entity48 , " " @entity49 , " " @entity50 " and " @entity51 " -- and across all our digital platforms			2
@entity53 vs. the little guy : why do you donate ? we will go behind the scenes at @entity57 , @entity58 's conservative pac that helped launched the trend ( and the conspiracy theories )			0
we 'll profile @entity61 , the @entity62 billionaire who wrote a $ 5 million check to a pac that waged a nasty air war against @entity65 in @entity21 , helping to pave the way for @entity68 's stunning primary victory on saturday			0
we 'll air an investigation into how super pacs have outmaneuvered a bewildering obstacle course of campaign finance regulations , and given rise to calls for a whole new maze of do 's and don'ts			1
at the same time , we 'll try to put some much - needed context around a subject that has become grist for knee - jerk partisan rhetoric			0
we 'll report on how @entity80 -- definitely not coordinated with president @entity81 ! -- are also playing the super pac game			2
( we 'll also profile some " heavy hitters " who will be openly supporting the president in 2012 and others who have turned their back on him since 2008			0
) we 'll analyze the controversial " @entity89 " ruling by the @entity90 that sanctioned unlimited corporate and union donations to nonaffiliated pacs , showing how it eliminated some troublesome inequities in the previous financing rules while adding new complexities			2
we will also look at how much money you need nowadays to run for office at the local , congressional and @entity101 levels , and at how much politicians stand to make personally while in office and once they leave			0
as @entity0 's team of political reporters and analysts decamps from @entity21 to cover the @entity109 primary this week , they will assess the impact that money has -- and has n't -- had in this electoral cycle so far			1
how much did it determine who threw their hat into the @entity118 ring in the first place and who stayed away ? how different would things be now if @entity65 and the ( definitely not coordinated ) @entity23 run by his former aides had n't had millions to savage @entity123 with negatives ads in @entity125 , or if @entity61 had n't put up his $ 5 million to tear down @entity65 in @entity21 ? and could money help alter the dynamic of the @entity118 primary contest yet again in @entity109 , given the staggering costs of organizing across such a large state and buying political ads in so many expensive local media markets ? for all the hyperventilation about super pacs , we 'll also examine all the ways in which the narrative of this campaign shows that money still is n't everything in politics : the flameout of @entity143 's deep - pocketed campaign , the staying power of @entity146 's grass - roots movement , the number of times that the " free media " of press coverage have shifted the momentum overnight , from the latest debate to the personal scandal du jour			1
and on @entity0 , we will solicit @entity155 videos from scores of ordinary citizens across @entity48 who have donated $ 50 or less to a political campaign this year and who want to deliver a simple message : this is what i want for my money ! for here at @entity0 , our aim is n't to take sides or tell you what to think			1
it 's to give you the news and knowledge you need to make up your own mind -- and the confidence to make your own voice heard .			0

in an @entity179 series of reports this week , @entity0 explores super pacs
@entity0 will assess the impact that money has -- and has n't -- had in this electoral cycle
we 'll look at what it costs to launch a campaign and how much you could make if you win
