-- when people across the world tune in to the opening ceremony of the @entity5 on friday , regular tv programming will be set aside for pageantry and pomp			1
amid all the attention to the " @entity12 " controversy about @entity11 's uniforms , little has been written about their design			1
but if numerous online slide shows ranking the best and worst of the opening ceremonies uniforms are any indication , the design is what we 're most interested in			2
opinion : why not make @entity22 uniforms in @entity23 ? @entity24 did not always wear uniforms in the @entity22 , and the @entity26 did not adopt a cohesive look until about 1920			2
today , however , with huge worldwide audiences and markets at stake , the uniform is a calculated part of each nation 's global image			1
the colors , patterns , silhouettes , lines and shapes of each nation 's uniform form a statement about its identity			1
@entity26 designers , for example , have frequently used white cowboy hats in their ensembles			0
strike a pose : high style meets high performance at @entity5 designed by @entity57 , @entity11 's 2012 opening ceremony uniforms feature berets and navy , brass - buttoned , double - breasted blazers for the men that -- even without chevrons , medals or epaulettes -- draw clear inspiration from the dress uniforms of the @entity62 and @entity63			1
should the appropriation of military style concern us ? almost all @entity22 uniforms we see today derive from religious or military forms of apparel			1
military apparel migrated to civilian life centuries ago , when veterans realized uniforms invited attributions of reliability , discipline and heroism and when various civil institutions used them as a means of regulating groups of people			2
men 's clothing strongly has been influenced by military looks , and the fashion industry markets " military chic " to women as well			2
@entity26 's love affair with military looks is especially intense and enduring			2
and unlike the @entity89 , when military uniforms were appropriated in anti-war protests , today 's military looks are part of a sartorial status quo that subtly affirms a pro-soldier , pro-military message			2
we know the athletes are not real warriors , of course , but clothing sends powerful messages			0
fashion critics long have charged that military fashions are a problem because they aestheticize war and divorce clothes from their true functions and origins			1
we ought to be wary of efforts to make any aspect of war desirable			0
considering that the @entity26 spends more on defense than the next 10 nations combined , some would argue that dressing the @entity115 like members of the armed forces during the biggest television event of the year is an arrogant or impolitic choice			0
skeptics might counter that @entity122 's opening ceremony outfits are militaristic , too			1
but @entity122 's are more clearly sportswear , and in color , pattern and tone , their look is joyful and lighthearted			0
and @entity122 is n't a global military power			0
for most @entity26 , however , the military style of the 2012 the uniforms will raise little concern because we have been encouraged to ignore the countless ways in which military culture is integrated into our society			1
fashion designers promote military styles as cutting edge , but usually refute the notion that the military aesthetic has anything to do with real war			0
glitzy @entity143 marketing campaigns , military - backed @entity145 films and first - person shooter video games elevate the cultural status of uniformed troops and encourage us to identify with them			0
all of these things help maintain a pro-military citizenry			0
the 2012 @entity22 uniforms are another in a long series of salutes to and affirmations of the @entity26 military			1
they are a product of an inherited , imperial history of clothing , of our particular war - fighting history and of the " support the troops " trope so common in 21st century war rhetoric			0
readers : forget uniforms , @entity115 would bet better off ' naked ' whether we 're comfortable with it or not , the military uniform of @entity11 is at least as @entity26 as white cowboy hats			1
but there are other choices			0
historically , roughly half of the @entity26 opening ceremonies uniforms have been inspired by sportswear , including the excellent styles in the @entity179			0
maybe it 's time to get more creative			0
in the next @entity22 , how about getting @entity181 to design a uniform that is radically different ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : in @entity22 , uniform is a calculated part of each nation 's global image
@entity185 : @entity11 's 2012 opening ceremony uniforms draw from military style
critics charge that military fashions are a problem because they aestheticize war , he says
@entity185 : how about getting @entity181 to design our uniform for the next @entity22 ?
