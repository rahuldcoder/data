-- millions of " @entity2 " fans are feeling sadness , outrage , and , sure , some perverse excitement after watching sunday 's episode titled " @entity7			1
" but for @entity2 author @entity10 , such reactions to " the @entity9 " are nothing new			1
@entity10 has been receiving exclamatory emails about the disastrous @entity13 union for more than a decade , ever since he published his @entity16 saga 's third novel , @entity9			1
below , the author reveals why @entity17 had to die , gives his reaction to upset readers and spills the scene 's horrifying real - life inspiration			1
@entity0 : how early in the process of writing the book series did you know you were gon na kill off @entity17 and @entity26 ? @entity10 : i knew it almost from the beginning			1
not the first day , but very soon			1
i 've said in many interviews that i like my fiction to be unpredictable			1
i like there to be considerable suspense			1
i killed @entity34 in the first book and it shocked a lot of people			1
i killed @entity34 because everybody thinks he 's the hero and that , sure , he 's going to get into trouble , but then he 'll somehow get out of it			1
the next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father			1
and everybody is going to expect that			1
so immediately [ killing @entity17 ] became the next thing i had to do			1
since @entity16 so often subverts reader expectations and avoids traditional fantasy storytelling structures , should fans have any real hope that this tale will have a happy ending ? as @entity58 recently said on @entity2 , " if you think this has a happy ending , you have n't been paying attention			1
" i 've stated numerous times that i anticipate a bittersweet ending			1
@entity0 : what sort of reactions have you received from readers over the years about the scene ? extreme			1
that was the hardest scene i 've ever had to write			1
it 's two - thirds of the way through the book , but i skipped over it when i came to it			1
so the entire book was done and there was still that one chapter left			1
it was like murdering two of your children			1
i try to make the readers feel they 've lived the events of the book			1
just as you grieve if a friend is killed , you should grieve if a fictional character is killed			1
if somebody dies and you just go get more popcorn , it 's a superficial experience is n't it ? @entity0 : why do you think it has such a powerful reaction ? @entity17 was n't one of your " viewpoint characters " in the books and @entity26 was n't really a beloved personality			1
[ long pause ] that 's an interesting question			1
i do n't know if i have a good answer			1
maybe the way i did it			1
there 's a certain amount of foreboding leading up to it			1
it comes out of left field			2
it 's at a wedding feast			2
@entity17 has made his peace and you think the worst is over			1
then it comes out of nowhere			2
there 's also secondary characters killed			2
then outside hundreds of @entity116 people are killed			2
it 's not just two people			2
to me , that @entity17 and @entity26 are family makes it worse			1
and @entity26 has suffered so much and lost so many people around her , and she actually thinks she 's lost more than she really has ( since she does n't know for sure that @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 are alive )			2
she also has the moment there to plead			2
there 's also her murdering the hostage			2
he 's not a son that @entity133 particularly values			2
* so in the end her bluff is empty			2
there 's a certain power to that too			2
@entity0 : i 'm pretty sure i know the answer to this , but : have you ever regretted the scene ? @entity10 : no. not as a writer			1
it 's probably the most powerful scene in the books			1
it cost me some readers , but gained me many more			2
it 's going to be hard for me to watch it [ on the show ]			2
it 's going to be a tough night			2
because i love these characters too			2
and in a tv show you get to know the actors			2
you 're also ending that relationship with an actor that you have affection for			0
@entity161 and @entity162 have done an amazing job			0
@entity0 : what do you say to readers who are upset about the scene ? it depends on what they say			1
what can you say to someone who says they 'll never read your book again ? people read books for different reasons			0
and some of my former readers have said their life is hard , their mother is sick , their dog died , and they read fiction to escape			0
they do n't want to get hit in the mouth with something horrible			0
and you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair			0
we all want that at times			0
there 's a certain vicarious release to that			0
so i 'm not dismissive of people who want that			0
but that 's not the kind of fiction i write , in most cases			1
it 's certainly not what @entity16 is			0
it tries to be more realistic about what life is			0
it has joy , but it also had pain and fear			0
i think the best fiction captures life in all its light and darkness			0
one of my favorite elements of the scene is you introduce this idea of " salt and bread			1
" we accept that as readers â € ” okay , in this fantasy world , people do n't harm each other once they eat a host 's bread and salt in their home			0
then you break your own rule			0
it 's like you 're smacking the reader upside the head for being so dense â € ” " of course they 're not going to follow that silly rule all the time ! " it was stolen from history			0
hospitality laws were real in @entity246 society			0
a host and guest were not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies			0
by violating that law , the phrase is , they " condemn themselves for all time			0
" @entity0 : what about the @entity9 itself ? is that based on history too ? the @entity9 is based on a couple real events from @entity261 history			0
one was a case called @entity263			0
the king of @entity261 was fighting the @entity266 clan			0
he reached out to make peace			0
he offered the young @entity266 safe passage			0
he came to @entity269 and had a great feast			0
then at the end of the feast , [ the king 's men ] started pounding on a single drum			0
they brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the @entity266 and revealed it was the head of a black boar â € ” the symbol of death			0
and as soon as he saw it , he knew what it meant			0
they dragged them out and put them to death in the courtyard			0
the larger instance was the @entity290			0
@entity291 stayed with the @entity293 clan overnight and the laws of hospitality supposedly applied			0
but the @entity293 arose and started butchering every @entity291 they could get their hands on			0
no matter how much i make up , there 's stuff in history that 's just as bad , or worse			0
