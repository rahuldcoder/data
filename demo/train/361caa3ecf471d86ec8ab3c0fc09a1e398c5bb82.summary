president @entity0 says that the last @entity3 troops will leave @entity4 at the end of 2016			1
this happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down @entity3 's post- 9/11 wars			0
but is it a wise policy ? short answer : of course not			0
one only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in @entity19 after the withdrawal of @entity3 troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an @entity4 without some kind of residual @entity3 presence			1
without @entity3 forces in the country , there is a strong possibility @entity4 could host a reinvigorated @entity32 allied to a reinvigorated @entity33			1
needless to say , this would be a disaster for @entity4			0
but it would also be quite damaging to @entity3 interests to have some kind of resurgent @entity33 in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks			0
it would also be disastrous for the @entity43 , should it win the presidency in 2016 , to be the party that " lost " @entity4			0
after all , the @entity43 is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the @entity49 and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual @entity3 presence in @entity53 would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the @entity4 - @entity57 border region against @entity3 interests			1
an easy way for potential @entity43 presidential candidates such as @entity61 to distinguish their national security policies from @entity0 's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long - term @entity3 military presence in @entity4 and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an @entity19 - style outcome there			1
similarly , as the @entity49 starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign , potential candidates such as @entity70 can distinguish themselves from the isolationist @entity73 wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long - term presence in @entity4			0
this @entity3 military presence in @entity4 does n't have to be a large , nor does it need to play a combat role , but @entity3 troops should remain in @entity4 to advise the @entity4 army and provide intelligence support			1
such a long - term commitment of several thousand @entity3 troops is exactly the kind of force that the @entity0 administration was forced to deploy to @entity19 during the past six months following @entity87 's lightning advances			1
selling such a long - term @entity3 military presence in @entity4 would be pushing against an open door with that nation 's government			1
consider that within 24 hours of being installed , the new @entity4 government signed the basing agreement that allows @entity3 troops to stay in @entity4 until december 2016			1
consider also that the @entity4 government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the @entity3 lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term @entity3 military presence			2
consider also that many @entity4 see a relatively small , but long - term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability			0
it is also not in @entity57 's interests for @entity4 to fall to the @entity32 or be thrust into another civil war			0
the @entity57 have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the @entity32 to flourish on their own soil , most recently in the @entity32 attack last month on the army school in @entity110 that killed 132 children			0
it is in @entity57 's own interest that the @entity4 army is able to fight effectively against the @entity32 , which is more likely if they continue to have @entity3 advisers at their side			2
other regional powers such as the @entity118 worry about @entity120 separatists establishing themselves on @entity122 @entity121 are similarly worried about @entity124 terrorist groups located in @entity4 and so will not stand in the way of a small long - term @entity3 military presence in @entity4 as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country			2
keeping a relatively small , predominantly @entity131 , presence in @entity4 to continue to train the @entity4 army past december 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both @entity4 and @entity3			2
both the @entity43 and @entity49 parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign .			0

@entity139 says it would be a serious mistake to pull all @entity3 forces from @entity4
it would invite the kind of chaos we *'ve* seen in @entity19 with the rise of @entity87
