@entity0 -- @entity2 left the @entity4 presidential campaign with a mixed legacy and a campaign deep in debt			1
the former speaker was left for political dead last year after his top campaign advisers quit over a disagreement on the direction of the campaign and its financial structure			1
but he came roaring back in late 2011 -- due in part to a @entity4 electorate that was not sold on @entity18 's candidacy			0
it is the past few months , though , for which he may be most remembered -- for staying in the race for too long , rather than for the big ideas he espoused on the campaign trail			1
" he has not made a good case for his name after this primary is over , " said @entity25 , a @entity1 contributor who served as president @entity29 's spokesman			0
" and that 's a shame , because @entity2 's done a lot for the @entity4 , but graciousness is part of politics			0
you just have to know when your time has come to walk off the stage			0
" for most , that time would have been after his @entity43 strategy failed , when he failed to win the @entity46 and @entity47 primaries after coming out on top of the @entity50 and @entity51 primaries			1
on wednesday , @entity52 suspended his campaign and pledged to be an " active citizen " and to continue to work on behalf of " @entity55 exceptionalism , " energy independence and health care reform			2
in throwing his support to @entity18 , @entity52 seemed to put aside differences he and other conservatives have with the presumptive nominee and look instead to the general election			2
" you know , this is not a choice between @entity18 and @entity68 , this is a choice between @entity18 and the most radical leftist president in @entity55 history , " @entity52 said			2
after limping along for weeks , @entity52 's campaign ended last week after a disappointing last stand in @entity74 , one of five states that went for @entity18 that day			1
campaign sources said a day later that @entity52 would end his campaign this week			2
@entity79 , editorial director of @entity80 and a @entity1 contributor , said the campaign 's impact on @entity52 's legacy will be mixed			1
" on the one hand , his ascent was a reminder that he remains one of the most skilled provocateurs in @entity55 politics			0
the fact that he was able to emerge as a serious contender , more than a decade after he last was a major player in @entity4 politics , was a testament to his skill at framing issues and shaping debate , " @entity79 said			0
" on the other hand , the campaign was also a reminder of @entity52 's weakness , including a self - confidence that tips over into hubris and a lack of discipline			1
and while @entity52 reaffirmed his identity as a politician who believes in big ideas , that image is more lasting than any of the specific ideas he proposed			2
" @entity115 of @entity52 's agenda will be part of the @entity4 campaign going forward , @entity79 said			1
" he wanted colonizing the moon to be a symbol of thinking big and outside the box ; instead it became a symbol of grandiosity and impractical thinking			0
after this campaign , as before it , @entity52 will always symbolize some of both			2
" campaign on the rocks early @entity52 formally announced his bid for the nomination last may , only to see it almost crash the next month when a half - dozen staffers , including the senior leadership , left the campaign			1
among the gripes from the departed staffers was that it was difficult to schedule campaign events or spend the time needed to raise money to fuel the campaign			0
in addition , there were complaints that @entity52 's wife , @entity146 , had veto power over all scheduling requests			1
while his staffers felt @entity52 should be hitting the trail , he and @entity146 embarked on a two - week luxury cruise in the @entity153 that for some in the campaign was the last straw			1
two of @entity52 's top staffers with ties to @entity161 gov. @entity160 bolted for the @entity160 campaign in june , and @entity52 's campaign was presumed dead just as it was getting started			1
his campaign languished over the summer and into the fall as conservatives test - drove a series of anyone - but - @entity18 candidates : first @entity170 , then @entity160 , then @entity171			0
as his rivals rose and fell , @entity52 turned in strong performances in @entity4 debates -- which earned him a second look from those who were longing for an alternative to @entity18 , whose conservative convictions they questioned			0
by december , polls had made gingrich the front - runner with a double - digit lead over @entity18			0
but @entity18 , his supporters and @entity52 opponents went on the attack -- calling his consulting firm 's work for the conservative - despised federal mortgage giant @entity189 " lobbying " and re-airing dirty laundry from his previous four decades in government			2
after lackluster showings in @entity194 and @entity195 , @entity52 made a stand in friendlier @entity50 , with the help of a super pac funded by casino magnate @entity199 which went on the attack against @entity18			1
@entity52 scored a double - digit win			2
that was arguably @entity52 's high - water mark			1
@entity206 results stop momentum @entity18 's better - funded campaign , aided by friendly super pacs , crushed @entity52 in @entity206 and stopped his momentum			1
@entity52 focused his campaign on the @entity50 and @entity212			1
he won @entity51 , which he represented in @entity213 for 20 years , but he could n't pick up @entity214			0
he went on to lose @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity215 , which all went to @entity216			0
as @entity52 and @entity216 continued to split the conservative vote , calls got louder for the former speaker to drop out and make it a two - man race between @entity216 and @entity18			2
hearing the calls , @entity52 instead suggested that @entity216 drop out and questioned the former @entity225 senator 's qualifications			2
and then as @entity216 surged , @entity52 suggested that he and @entity216 form an alliance to " tag - team " @entity18 and derail his run to the nomination			0
despite all this , @entity52 did accomplish something few have , @entity79 said			0
" with this campaign , @entity52 established himself as someone who has been a serious force in @entity4 politics in five different decades , a pretty remarkable accomplishment			2
" @entity52 's five decades in government began when the then - college professor was elected to @entity213 in the late 1970s			1
he rode the @entity241 into the speaker 's chair in the mid 1990s -- a pledge to the @entity55 people to institute sweeping changes if the @entity4 took over the majority in @entity213			0
when republicans took over the @entity248 in 1994 -- the first time in four decades -- @entity52 was chosen as the new speaker			1
@entity52 challenged president @entity250 's @entity248 as congressional @entity4 pushed government cuts to help balance the budget			1
both sides dug in and there were two government shutdowns -- but the shutdowns backfired on @entity52 , and @entity4 came out the political losers			2
@entity52 led efforts to impeach @entity250 over an investigation of his infidelities with @entity248 intern @entity261 , but @entity250 was acquitted			1
it was later revealed the @entity52 was having an affair with a congressional staffer as he was leading the charge against @entity250			0
dogged by ethics questions he was also dogged by ethics issues brought by @entity269			0
he voluntarily turned in a $ 4.5 million book advance after critics questioned its appropriateness			0
and in 1997 , @entity52 agreed to pay $ 300,000 to the @entity248 to reimburse the cost of an investigation into whether he used tax - exempt funds to promote @entity4 causes			1
he was not found guilty of those charges , but was reprimanded by the @entity248 for giving what was considered misleading information			0
republicans kept control of the @entity248 for a third consecutive term in the 1998 elections , but won fewer seats than expected			0
he resigned as speaker and left @entity213 the next year			0
over the next decade , @entity52 mounted a comeback , expounding on the lecture circuit and through think tanks on how to reform government and society -- ranging from creating a new social security system based on what a person contributes , to completely revamping the country 's energy policy , to replacing the @entity298 with a new @entity299			2
he was also a prolific fundraiser for conservative candidates and causes			0
his visibility was elevated when he joined @entity304 as a contributor , which gave him a national platform to comment on the events of the day and promote a number of books he has written on subjects ranging from the @entity55 political scene to @entity68			0
his @entity304 contract was suspended when he announced his bid for the @entity248			0
@entity52 leaves the trail with his campaign $ 4.3 million in debt , according to @entity319 filings			1
a @entity4 strategist said that @entity52 's run reflected how badly the party wanted a big thinker in the @entity248			1
" republicans wanted an ideas guy like @entity2 to be president so badly that at times we even turned to @entity2 , a fatally flawed candidate , " said @entity324 , a @entity1 contributor who advised @entity18 's campaign in 2008			1
@entity324 sees @entity52 's legacy as like @entity332 ' : " he helped lead his party to the promised land , but he did n't get there himself			1
" @entity1 's @entity336 , @entity337 and @entity338 contributed to this report .			0
