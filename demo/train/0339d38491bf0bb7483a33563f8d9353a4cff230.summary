@entity1 groups urging sen. @entity3 to run for president in 2016 are kicking off their @entity6 organizing efforts with a rally on saturday in @entity8			1
@entity11 and @entity12 , two liberal groups urging the progressive senator to run , are dispatching grassroots organizers to the first - in - the - nation primary state this week with the goal of encouraging local volunteers , politicians and activists to help convince @entity19 she needs to run for president			1
" our folks on the ground are going to reach out to the really strong activist community that exists in @entity6 , " said @entity21 , @entity12 's spokesman			2
" we want to show @entity3 that if she decided to get into the race , there is a strong grassroots army ready to do everything a candidate needs to run a competitive race in the @entity6			2
" saturday will make the start of these efforts			2
leaders from @entity12 , @entity11 and other progressive come together for their first meeting in @entity6 , with the goal of charting next steps in convincing @entity19 to run			1
those steps are likely to include opening offices across the state and dispatching more organizers in the coming months			2
the " @entity44 " efforts , which launched late last year , have so far picked up over 200,000 supporters across the country			0
while they are n't alone -- groups like super @entity49 for @entity19 have been organizing around a possible @entity19 run since early last year -- the coalition of @entity11 and @entity12 has been some of the most organized work around the senator			1
that said , the efforts have so far not moved the @entity57 senator to make a run at the presidency and , in some respects , @entity19 has moved further away from a run			1
in an interview published by @entity63 on tuesday , @entity19 was asked by former @entity65 chairman @entity64 whether if she will run for president			1
" no , " the @entity57 senator flatly said			0
that is new , given the senator has repeatedly knocked down presidential speculation by simply saying , " i am not running for president			0
" the denial is in present tense , meaning @entity19 was n't running for president at this moment			1
when some reporters pressed her on this , @entity19 would just repeat , " i am not running for president			1
" if she does decide to run , though , she would n't be the first politician to change their mind on a presidential bid			0
@entity19 outlined her liberal economic agenda earlier this month in a campaign - style speech that electrified liberal and labor organizers in the audience			2
" for more than 30 years , too many politicians in @entity1 have made deliberate choices that favored those with money and power , " she told the @entity84 audience			0
" and the consequence is that instead of an economy that works well for everyone , @entity91 now has an economy that works well for about 10 percent of the people			0
" related : @entity84 president trumpets @entity19 , calls for @entity97 to pick sides on labor issues in 2015 speeches like that , @entity21 said , have made the liberal organizers more upbeat about their plans			1
their view is that if more people saw @entity19 speak , they would be convinced to support her			0
" we have watched very , very closely , " the organizer said of @entity19 's speeches			0
" what you saw there was a senator and frankly a potential presidential candidate speaking out for million of @entity91 who are struggling to get by and laying out a popular progressive economic message for the country			0
" he concluded , " that is the kind of speech a presidential candidate might make			0
