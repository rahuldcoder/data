" if we need to make changes as a result of what happened on friday to improve the system , we will not hesitate to do so , " @entity96 said			0
" we need to be looking at everything ... from the people that we employ through our contractors all the way through all the processes that we use -- how they have access to our facilities and what kind of monitoring takes place within those facilities			0
that 's all on the table , " he said			0
@entity96 told @entity1 that background checks on @entity9 had not identified any potential problems , and so he wants investigators to look into that vetting process , too			2
" are there things that we need to do differently ? immediately , it 's more eyes , more resources and more frequent check - ins with facilities , but over the long term , if there are things that we identify that we should change , we 're certainly going to change them , " the administrator said			0

after the fire , air traffic controllers initially had to transfer flight data manually rather than by computer , said @entity164 , spokesman for the @entity165			1
@entity166 said the fire damaged the telecom line that transfers flight plans from the airlines to the busy @entity32 control tower and then to the @entity39 control center			0
airlines had to fax flight plans to the control tower , he said			0
because so much information had to be manually transferred , two controllers were needed for each position			0
the effects of the fire were immediate			0
@entity32 is a hub for @entity180 and other major carriers			0
when controllers stop flights scheduled to land or depart from there , it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air - traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would - be passengers			2
the @entity26 said it is bringing in extra technicians to replace the damaged communications network in the building			2
" @entity194 will be working around the clock to install equipment , run cable and restore network connections at the facility , " the @entity26 said			2
