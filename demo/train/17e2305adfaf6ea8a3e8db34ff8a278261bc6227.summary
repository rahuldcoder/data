-- he 's one of the leading movers and shakers in the tennis world -- and he has set his sights on world domination			2
@entity8 ( @entity8 ) chairman @entity7 believes tennis has never been in better health , with spectator numbers booming and new players bursting through to challenge established crowd - pullers @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
that fan interest was evident at @entity20 's @entity19 this month as crowds of up to 17,000 packed the venue to watch the world 's top eight do battle in the @entity24			0
after next year 's edition , the event could be on the move as @entity7 and his colleagues look to bring live tennis to more fans worldwide			1
" we are one of the few sports that does have a truly global footprint -- it 's played globally , the interest is global , " the 49 - year - old @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity32			2
" you look at our top stars now and they have almost transcended their sport and become global icons			0
" the challenge now for @entity7 is to discover if there 's any part of the world that has n't fallen in love with tennis			1
" we 've got to look at our own business and try to extend the boundaries of where we can get into new markets , new territories , new audiences -- we 've just got to explore everything , " added @entity7 , who is approaching the end of his first year as @entity8 chairman			1
" what we did in @entity20 with the @entity24 was to try and attract an audience that maybe had never seen tennis before			2
" to see it live is very different from seeing it on television , and being indoors highlights the drama and the dynamism of these top players			2
" we wanted to put something on that was very different to @entity71 in order to attract this new audience , " said @entity7 referring to the grass grand slam , which emphasizes a more traditional approach to the game			1
a former player who has been involved in tennis for the past three decades , @entity7 believes interest in the game in @entity78 , both on and off the court , is surging , with the emergence of @entity82 as @entity84 's first - ever top 10 male player a key factor			1
" i think it 's just the beginning in @entity78 , " says the @entity8 chairman			1
" the calibre of men 's tennis is so strong -- the depth is just extraordinary -- that i think it would be successful in almost any region now , but when you have that domestic player it adds the wow factor			0
" @entity82 is very aware of that			0
he is a young kid , he is a lovely lad ... but that level of expectation on his shoulders , it 's a whole country looking at him , that 's pretty tough			0
" @entity7 's enthusiasm for growing tennis is based on a belief that he took over at an opportune moment -- " i inherited the game in probably the best health it 's ever been , " he says -- and a fascination with what lies ahead			1
" we 've got this mixture of the old guard of players and the young guns coming up , so on the court our product is the most exciting it 's ever been for years , " he explains			1
" we are doing an internal review of the business , but last year we had record crowds , and this year we are going to beat that record again			0
" it 's not just crowds that are on the up			0
according to @entity7 , television audiences for tennis are increasing , " digital has gone through the roof , " while the sport has grown commercially by 200 % since 2009			1
the @entity8 chairman is particularly intrigued by the potential changing of the guard -- what happens when @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are displaced from the top of the tree ? but he does n't see that as something to worry about , arguing the field is now so strong that other players will step in to provide box - office appeal			1
" we talk about the young guns coming in , and there are so many of them , but the old guard are n't going down easily , " says @entity7			1
" @entity15 is there and that 's after people had written him off a couple of years ago			0
" lots of people talk doom and gloom about how tennis is going to be finished [ when the current big four finish their careers ] , but i heard that when i grew up in the @entity161 and @entity162 era			0
" everyone said it would never be the same again , but then along comes an @entity165 , along comes a @entity166			0
" and the secret of these players ' appeal ? " @entity172 is a very simple business model -- it 's about caring who wins over someone else , and that 's all it is , " @entity7 explains			2
" if you do n't care , it 's not that interesting			0
if you know a bit more about their lives , i think that helps as well -- you buy in to them as a person			0
" if his vision of the future for tennis is correct , people will soon be doing just that all over the world .			2
