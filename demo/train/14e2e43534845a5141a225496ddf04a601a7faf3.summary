-- it was just after 5 a.m. on a cold november morning in 2011 when @entity2 , a 68 - year - old @entity3 with a severe heart condition , accidentally set off a medical alert pendant			1
an ambulance was dispatched to @entity8 's @entity7 , @entity9 , apartment , though police who respond to such calls as a matter of routine arrived ahead of the emergency medical workers			1
within the hour , @entity8 , who is black , lay dying -- from two rounds fired into his upper body by a white police officer			1
what led to the shooting of @entity8 is the subject of a grand jury hearing underway this month , and a matter of heated debate between the @entity7 @entity26 and @entity8 's family and friends			1
police say @entity8 came at them with a butcher knife when they broke down the door after he refused to open it ; the family claims the elderly @entity8 was unarmed , and that he told police through the closed door that he did not need any assistance			1
in wake of the case of @entity41 , the unarmed , black 17 - year - old who was shot and killed in @entity42 , @entity43 , by a neighborhood watch volunteer , the @entity8 case has gained national interest -- and national media attention			1
more than 206,000 people have signed an online petition demanding " justice for @entity2 , " with many signatories drawing similarities between the case and that of @entity41			1
the petition , started by @entity8 's son , @entity55 , calls for @entity57 district attorney @entity56 to charge the officers involved in the shooting with murder and civil rights violations			1
" i am sorry for your loss			0
an outrage of the magnitude of @entity41 , " @entity64 of @entity65 , @entity66 , wrote on the petition			2
much of the controversy surrounds audio and video recordings made in the minutes before the november 19 shooting			1
the medical alert device recorded much of the conversation between police and @entity8 , according to @entity2 , who said authorities played the audio and video for the family in the aftermath of the shooting			1
" you hear one of the officers use expletive and said that he did n't give an @entity85 used the n - word , " he said			0
law enforcement sources confirmed to @entity0 's @entity88 that racial slurs are clearly heard on the audio tape			0
@entity8 's niece , @entity91 , who lived next door , said she heard police banging on her uncle 's door that morning			1
@entity91 , who has been called to testify before the grand jury , said she told police that her uncle accidentally set off his medical alert device and that they should allow his family to talk to him , to calm him down			1
" i continued to hear my uncle begging and pleading to please leave him alone , " @entity91 told @entity88			0
" i just keep hearing my uncle respond ' please leave me alone , go away			0
i did n't call you			0
i do n't need your help			0
' " according to a police report , the officers contend @entity8 put a hatchet through a gap in the front door as officers were trying to pry it open			1
a video tape recorded by a surveillance camera in the hallway outside the apartment , and another recorded by a camera mounted on a @entity116 -- both shown to the family by the district attorney -- show that he is unarmed , @entity8 's son said			1
neither video show the shooting			2
the video from the @entity116 cut out after it was used			0
police contend they attempted to subdue @entity8 first with non-lethal force			1
" the officers first used an electronic @entity116 , which was discharged , hit the victim , and had no effect			0
while the officers were retreating , the officers then used a bean bag shotgun , " said @entity128 , a @entity7 police spokesman			0
when that failed to stop @entity8 , an officer opened fire			2
the officer has been identified as @entity136			0
@entity128 said his office is cooperating with a grand jury investigation , but would not say whether @entity136 continues to be on patrol			0
@entity136 's lawyers say he is a decorated officer who followed procedures			0
" we trust that the grand jury will rightfully determine that officer @entity136 's actions , while perhaps not understandable or acceptable to the family members , attorneys and other emissaries of the @entity8 family , were justified under our laws , " @entity136 's attorney @entity143 told @entity0 in a written statement			2
an autopsy report , obtained by @entity0 , shows the gunshots hit @entity8 in the side of the arm , indicating he either was not facing the officers or had turned away			2
@entity57 is an affluent suburb north of @entity157 , though @entity8 lived in a one - bedroom apartment in a public housing project in @entity7 -- a commercial hub of roughly 60,000			2
" i think that what happened that night is that mr. @entity2 happened to live in public housing and we had police officers who gave him a command to open the door and when he did n't acknowledge their command , really became very agitated and angry because he was defying what they asked him to do , " @entity8 attorney @entity168 said on " @entity169			1
" " they forgot that they were there to deal with a medical emergency			0
you have here a 68 - year - old man who has served this country in @entity177 for six years , and a 20 - year retired member of the @entity179 for @entity57 who died , but did n't have to die			0
" the @entity8 have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the police department			2
the shooting death also prompted @entity57 residents to start a " @entity184 , " which calls on the police department to publicize how and when its officers may use deadly force			2
@entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
