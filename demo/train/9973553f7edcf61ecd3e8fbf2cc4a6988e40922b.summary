@entity0 -- the @entity2 turned aside friday a gay rights group 's request to temporarily suspend enforcement of the controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on gays in the military			1
the justices issued a brief order allowing the policy to remain in effect temporarily , until the full appeals process is completed			1
the @entity14 had filed an emergency request with the nation 's highest court to reverse the 9th @entity18 decision allowing the military to continue with " do n't ask , do n't tell " while the government appeals a lower court ruling that the law is unconstitutional			1
the appeals court , in @entity25 , @entity26 , is debating the constitutionality of barring openly gay and lesbian people from service in the @entity31 armed forces			1
until the larger questions are decided , that court had allowed the current enforcement policy to remain in place , prompting the time - sensitive appeal to the high court			1
the justices were , at this stage , being asked to rule only on the narrow enforcement issue			0
they are likely to tackle the constitutional questions after the appeals court issues its ruling , if @entity45 or the @entity46 does not act first to repeal the current law			1
" @entity14 are disappointed that the @entity2 decided to maintain the status quo ... but we are not surprised , " @entity14 executive director @entity48 said in a written statement			1
" we are committed to pursuing every avenue in the fight against this failed and unconstitutional policy			2
" @entity56 spokesman col. @entity55 said the @entity56 " believes the decision upholding the stay was appropriate			0
" the high court 's two - paragraph order noted that justice @entity61 did not participate in the decision			0
as solicitor general in the @entity64 before joining the high court in august , @entity61 had been involved in preparing initial briefs in the case			0
in september , @entity26 @entity31 district judge @entity68 declared the military 's ban on openly gay troops to be unconstitutional			2
she later granted an injunction barring enforcement of the policy			2
the @entity64 requested a temporary stay of that ruling , which was denied by @entity77 but granted by the appeals court			1
the appeals court later overturned the district court 's injunction			2
the appeals judges also noted that legislation pending before @entity45 to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot			2
the @entity85 has already passed a repeal provision , and the @entity87 may consider it as part of a broader defense authorization bill when it returns for a lame duck session in mid-november			0
the appeals court is set to hear oral arguments in the case next february			2
the losing side would probably ask the @entity2 to step in once again , but the justices have the discretion not to accept the case for review			0
president @entity98 wants to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" he reached an agreement with defense secretary @entity100 and adm. @entity101 , the chairman of the @entity103 , on a process that includes a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian troops serving alongside straight colleagues			2
the three men would then have to certify the repeal			0
gay rights groups say the policy violates the due process and first amendment rights of military members			1
in their appeal , the @entity14 said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal is unacceptable and would cause " irreparable harm			1
" the government presented " no evidence to support a finding that open service by gay and lesbian individuals harmed the military 's interests , and ... both civilian and military leaders admitted that @entity131 actually impairs military interests , " the appeal said			0
" deference to military judgment here tips the scales against a stay , rather than in favor of one , " it says			0
but the @entity98 administration , supported by @entity56 officials , argued that suspending the 17 - year - old policy and forcing the military to immediately change course while the case is being appealed would cause problems during a time of war			1
" the military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years , particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas , " the government said in its high court brief			1
the case puts the administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal , but filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned			0
the legislation before @entity45 includes the process for repeal agreed to with @entity100 and @entity101			0
in response to the court case , @entity100 recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under " do n't ask , do n't tell " by ordering that it be done only by the secretaries of the @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172			0
in a memo written to the heads of all the military services , @entity100 said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding " do n't ask , do n't tell " law			1
since @entity100 made the change , no service member has been discharged , according to @entity56 spokesman @entity182			0
@entity1 's @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report			0

@entity98 officials want the policy repealed , but oppose a court ruling to end it
@entity14 want enforcement of " do n't ask , do n't tell " suspended
the policy on gays in the military remains in effect until the appeals process is complete
a lower court has found the law unconstitutional
