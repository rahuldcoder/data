@entity0 -- @entity4 president @entity3 's plan to expand the military campaign against @entity7 terrorists into @entity8 , and to boost @entity4 backing for rebels fighting @entity8 's president @entity11 , represents a grave escalation that risks dragging the @entity4 and its allies into an open - ended regional war			1
in his televized speech to the nation on wednesday evening , @entity3 argued his proposed strategy of extended air strikes and use of local ground forces ( but not @entity4 combat troops ) against the extremists also known as @entity23 and the @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity8 was fundamentally different from past @entity27 policies that led the @entity4 to fight two @entity29 ground wars in as many decades			1
but @entity3 , as he has shown repeatedly since 2008 , is a reluctant warrior with no particular expertise in armed conflict			2
no doubt @entity33 felt that he , too , understood the risks when he started sending @entity4 advisors to @entity36 in the early 1960s			2
like @entity37 , he may be starting a fight he can not finish , which will run on and on for untold years			0
@entity3 , who came to office wearing the mantle of a man of peace and agent of change , has ultimately proved little different in this respect from predecessors such as @entity47 and @entity48			2
his tone on television was nationalistic and bombastic			0
@entity4 primacy , he said , was " the one constant in an uncertain world			2
" he continued : " our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden			0
but as @entity4 , we welcome our responsibility to lead			2
" in @entity3 's case this sounds slightly disingenuous			1
facing a rising , ignorant right - wing clamor about his alleged weakness and indecision in world affairs , the @entity3 of the " @entity61 " era has slowly and unwillingly been transformed into @entity66			2
in 2008 @entity3 promised an end to the wars in @entity25 and @entity69 , a new deal with the @entity72 world , a reset in relations with @entity75 , and real - time nuclear disarmament			1
six years later , his plans mostly lie in ruins , shot down like an unsuspecting aircraft over eastern @entity80 , and he is in danger of going backwards			0
" i 've spent four - and - a - half years working to end wars , not to start them , " @entity3 said last year , explaining his decision not to punish @entity11 for his chemical weapons attacks			1
now , in apparent response to his @entity87 critics , to public outrage over the beheadings of two @entity4 journalists , and with one eye on november 's mid-term congressional elections , @entity3 is stoking a generational conflict			1
it has the potential to further inflame @entity8 's civil war , draw in neighboring countries such as @entity98 and @entity99 and allies such as @entity101 and @entity102 , and provoke the very @entity7 threat to the @entity4 mainland and @entity105 that @entity3 admits does not currently exist			1
@entity3 's strategy , as set out wednesday , is full of holes			1
attacking @entity7 strongholds inside @entity8 will be portrayed by the @entity11 regime as vindication of its long - standing claim that the real fight there is against jihadists and terrorists , not a legitimate civilian opposition			1
@entity3 is gambling on the notoriously fractious @entity118 becoming a much more effective force than it has to date , and on @entity121 's willingness to underwrite it with up to $ 500 million in additional funds			2
@entity124 , on the other hand , may choose to oppose @entity4 intervention -- and he has the aircraft and the air defense systems to do so			2
what will @entity3 do if and when an @entity4 airman is shot down and captured by the @entity8 army ? @entity102 has already expressed reservations about getting involved in combat in @entity8 , as distinct from @entity25			1
there are also familiar questions about the legality of any such action , which will likely be raised by @entity75 , @entity11 's ally , or others at the @entity139			0
ground wars , if they are won at all , are invariably won on the ground , not in the air			1
recent proof of that contention may be found in @entity69 ( 2001 onwards ) @entity25 ( 2003 ) and @entity146 ( 2011 )			0
but @entity3 's forces will comprise , initially at least , an untested , rag - tag combination of @entity25 army troops ( who were sent fleeing by @entity7 during its spring offensive around @entity151 ) , @entity153 peshmerga , @entity8 rebels , @entity156 militias and , possibly , moderate @entity158 tribal groups			1
the fact that @entity3 has sent 1,100 @entity4 servicemen and women back to @entity25 to facilitate the airstrikes and help train local forces , and will now send an additional 475 , is not reassuring			1
they will likely be too few to make a definitive difference			0
so , as @entity168 showed , the call for more and larger reinforcements may not be long in coming			0
@entity3 is relying heavily on the new multi-ethnic government in @entity170 to unite the fractured country behind the effort against @entity7			1
he sent @entity173 there this week to stiffen its resolve			0
leaders such as @entity178 , @entity101 's prime minister , have made their involvement in air strikes contingent on a coherent and effective approach from @entity170			0
but @entity25 's new prime minister , @entity183 , a @entity156 like his predecessor , @entity184 , is not a miracle worker			0
the country is deeply divided along party , religious and geographic lines			0
the @entity153 regional government in @entity191 , the current good guys in the eyes of the @entity194 , has used the @entity7 crisis to cement its claim to de facto independence ( while seizing additional territory around @entity199 )			0
although a new national government has been agreed , the @entity153 ' secessionist agenda is fundamentally at odds with @entity170 's objectives			0
the @entity158 remain rightly suspicious of what power - sharing promises may mean in practice			0
there is no convincing sign as yet that they will launch a mooted @entity210 , taking on @entity7 in the way they took on @entity213 in 2007 under the tutelage of general @entity215			0
the @entity158 fear is that once the dust settles they will be sidelined by the @entity156 majority once again			0
another key part of @entity3 's strategy -- regional coalition - building -- is unimpressive to date			1
president @entity223 showed how strong alliances can be built , in the run up to the first @entity226 in 1991 , when he brought in @entity229 armies alongside @entity4 and @entity105 troops			0
in contrast , the @entity235 " core coalition " announced by @entity3 last week at the @entity237 summit in @entity238 contained not a single @entity229 country and only one neighbor , @entity98			0
@entity99 , which has tacitly supported @entity4 strikes against @entity7 in @entity25 , may take a different view of attacks in the territory of its ally , @entity11 -- and set to work to counter them			2
if it does , this in turn could adversely affect delicate nuclear negotiations between @entity250 and the @entity194 that reach a climax in november			0
more recruits to @entity3 's forces army are promised when the @entity254 meets later this month			1
without overt and practical backing from @entity256 , other @entity257 , and for example , @entity259 and @entity98 , @entity3 's bombing campaign to deny @entity7 safe haven may begin to look , to @entity262 everywhere , like another deeply objectionable intervention by the western powers in the @entity29			1
could @entity3 achieve the impossible and actually create sympathy for @entity7 ? given his shaky strategy and his performance to date , nothing can be ruled out			1
analysis : @entity3 speech a do - over on ' no strategy ' comment round - up : did @entity3 sell his @entity7 strategy ?			1

@entity277 : @entity3 's plan to expand military campaign against @entity7 risks open - ended war
campaign could inflame @entity8 's civil war , and provoke @entity7 threat to @entity4 mainland - @entity277
ground wars , if they are won at all , are won on ground , not in air - he adds
