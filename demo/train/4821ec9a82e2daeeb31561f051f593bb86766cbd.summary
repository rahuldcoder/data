-- i 've just returned from a visit to @entity3 with the global health and development organization @entity6 to better understand the challenges facing health workers in the developing world			1
the outbreak of @entity11 only underscores the dire need for trained health workers -- a global shortage of nearly 7.2 million health workers , according to the @entity16			1
about half of the spending on health care in @entity20 goes to private providers and care can be unregulated and quality inconsistent			1
during my week on the ground , however , i met @entity6 community health workers , nurses , doctors and business owners who deliver controlled and quality health care across @entity3			1
@entity6 has ensured quality care by applying proven commercial franchising strategies -- think @entity32 or @entity33 -- to health care			1
@entity6 operates a franchise network that spans 31 countries and serves 10 million people every year			1
in @entity3 , the franchise is called @entity39			1
@entity40 , a @entity39 community health worker , goes out into the community every day and educates women about family planning and other health issues			2
@entity40 then refers these women back to the neighborhood @entity46 located right in the village she serves			0
i joined @entity40 for a session she organized at a modest apartment building with a few rooms separated by concrete walls and colorful fabric curtains			0
when i climbed the stairs to the front porch , about a dozen women with babies who were seated on straw mats greeted me			0
@entity40 began to talk with them about their contraception options , and they had lots of questions for her			0
the most vocal was a gregarious woman named @entity66			0
@entity66 had used condoms and pills to space her births , but when @entity39 began offering longer - term methods like implants , she switched			0
the implant prevents pregnancy for up to three years , and she shared with us how it was a great weight off her shoulders			0
she told the group that she wanted to be able to plan her family size , so she and her husband could save for the future			0
@entity40 reiterated that for women like @entity66 , access to family planning is a key to health and economic stability			2
according to a report by the @entity87 and @entity88 , returns on investment in contraception can be recouped four times or more by reducing the need for public spending on social services			0
this is something @entity40 knows well -- before she ended the session , she gave out vouchers to our new friends for a consultation at their local @entity39 clinic			2
after the session , we walked back to the clinic together and @entity40 introduced me to dr. @entity105 -- the clinic owner and care provider			1
he 's the kind of doctor anyone would want : one with a gentle bedside manner who cares deeply for the community he serves			0
we talked about the clinic , his needs and the number of clients he sees -- up to 200 per day			2
dr. @entity105 said what he most needed was better business management skills			2
he was most appreciative about that component of @entity6 's franchise model -- the ongoing training he and his staff receive			1
this helps him retain employees -- a major problem in developing countries underscored by this most recent epidemic -- and maintain a standard of care his clients can trust			2
the @entity39 franchise incorporates 260 private health facilities across 16 regions in @entity3			1
@entity6 establishes the quality standards that clinics in the network , like dr. @entity105 's , must meet			1
and prices for products and services are set based on people 's ability and willingness to pay			0
with this structure , the health facilities can reach the very poor with free services and those who can afford to pay something with reduced fees			0
it 's working and clients are happy with the services they receive			0
according to @entity6 's study of the @entity152 , the client retention rate is 81 %			1
from 2009 to 2011 , @entity39 health workers provided 45,000 iuds and 14,000 implants to women who wanted a long - lasting method of contraception -- which equals 143,000 years of protection from unintended pregnanc y for @entity3 couples			1
this innovative model takes an unregulated sector with varying degrees of quality and standardizes the level of care			1
it provides the vital infrastructure necessary for a woman like @entity66 to take care of herself and her family , and a doctor and business owner like @entity105 to earn a decent living			2
as we left , i asked dr. @entity105 if his future plans included opening a few more clinics			0
he smiled , and simply said , " that 's my dream			0

@entity180 : @entity11 underscores the need for trained health workers in @entity20
@entity180 : care can be inconsistent , so @entity6 developed a " franchise " model for clinics
@entity180 went to @entity3 to observe quality , controlled health care in clinic franchise
she says the innovative model standardizes the level of care and business practices
