-- with gold prices officially in a bear market , investors must ask themselves if this is the time to buy ? i remember a gold bug telling me at the beginning of the gold bull market , around 2010 , that gold would hit $ 2000 , guaranteed			1
gold prices hit $ 1,888.70 in august 2011 and with monday 's big drop , it 's now more than 20 % off of that , even with tuesday 's slight bounce			1
why ? it depends on who you ask			0
some say it 's the slowing of the @entity22 economy			2
some say it 's a slowdown in actual physical gold sales in the crucial @entity27 market			1
there is even a worry that @entity31 governments , from tiny @entity32 to far bigger @entity33 , might flood the market by selling off state - owned gold to raise funds			2
the only reason to speculate on the big price fall is if you care which way gold prices are heading now			2
all commodities are weakening at the moment ; from oil to silver			1
but gold is supposed to have that extra luster			0
it 's a safe haven investment after all			1
it 's a hedge against inflation			1
and are n't we still in the midst of an economic crisis ? not if you look at share prices			0
in fact , analysts say people who are selling gold ( or , more accurately , gold futures contracts since few people take delivery of physical gold if it 's only an investment ) are using the money to buy shares			1
stocks with dividends give investors the chance to make a bit of money no matter what the market is doing			0
so , gold is not sexy anymore			0
if more people , or governments , decide to get out of gold , it will only go lower			2
of course it has a long way to fall to get back to 1980s and 1990s when gold was under $ 500			0
then it took off during the bubble years of the new century , only to gain even more traction as the much of the western world plunged into economic crisis			0
now , it 's a time of high unemployment , recession and austerity			0
funny that gold is also suffering , while stocks hit record or multi-year highs			0
when will investors move money out of stocks and back into gold ? or will it take a steep drop in gold , similar to oil in the 2008 , to bring investors back into the market ?			1

gold is considered a a safe haven asset and acts as a hedge against inflation
