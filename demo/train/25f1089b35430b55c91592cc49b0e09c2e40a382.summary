it 's january , the busiest month of the year for most gyms			1
typically , by february or march , many people lose focus and stop hitting the gym			1
this year is going to be different -- at least for the six lucky @entity1 viewers selected to be part of the 2015 @entity9 team			1
each participant will be getting a road bike ( with all the necessary accessories ) , a wet suit and a gym membership to prepare them to race alongside dr. @entity15 in the @entity16 on september 20			1
as they train for their first triathlon with support from fitness and nutrition coaches , they 'll blog , tweet and share their workouts online			1
you 'll watch and get to cheer them on as they get ready to swim a half - mile in the ocean , bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the @entity29			1
and we hope this year 's @entity32 team will inspire you to make your health a priority			1
if our past @entity9 team members are any indication , you 'll be happy you did			1
meet this year 's team : having a training partner is critical to the success of any life - changing program			1
many past @entity9 team members have trained along with their spouses , partners , friends and family , all with great results			1
this year , we decided to pick a husband and wife duo -- @entity52 and @entity53 -- to be part of the challenge			1
she spends much of her day talking to women about maintaining healthy lifestyles , eating well and staying healthy throughout pregnancy			1
but @entity52 admits she has a long way to go toward practicing what she preaches			1
" as a busy mom and working full time , it 's just impossible to lose this weight , " she says			2
" but i feel like it 's really important to set the standard and to be a good role model for those patients			2
" when she and @entity71 met , they were both in much better shape , but life got in the way			2
@entity52 's father passed away from cancer			2
then they had a child , which torpedoed several of their healthy habits			2
@entity71 says he wants them both to get in better shape , so they can be good role models for their 3 - year - old daughter , @entity86			2
" we 're ready to hit the reset button and start over , get our lives back , be more productive and have more energy , " he says			2
" and be a happier couple , " @entity52 chimes in			2
" i think it 's really strained our relationship			2
" @entity71 's also looking forward to being able to do " the worm " with the same finesse he had back in college			2
at 67 , @entity98 is the oldest person to have ever joined our team , but looking at her , you 'd never believe she was a day over 50			1
the semiretired psychiatric nurse says having a busy career and raising two children caused her to overlook her own health and fitness			1
it was n't until last year when someone at her local gym talked her into doing a mud run that her " inner athlete " came out			0
" i completed it , and i had a ball , " @entity112 says			0
" i want to bring that enthusiasm to the @entity9			1
" working out at a gym several days a week has already helped her keep those " pesky senior citizen aches " at bay			0
training for a triathlon , she says she hopes to be in the best shape of her life			1
" i 'm a triathlete in my mind			0
... i want to make it a reality , " she says			0
@entity126 , 34 , says he is ready to shed the weight he 's carried around his whole life and help change attitudes in the @entity132 - @entity131 community where he grew up			0
at 300 pounds and suffering from type 2 diabetes , this attorney says , " enough is enough			0
" he 's hoping the @entity1 program will help give him a shot at making changes that stick			1
but his reasons also go deeper			0
" i 'm not going to make it past 40 if i do n't really focus on losing weight and taking care of myself , " @entity140 says			0
" my culture has a very ingrained commitment to taking care of our elders , and if i ca n't take care of myself , how can i take care of them ? " @entity152 , 35 , says there 's no secret to how she ballooned to more than 250 pounds , but she did have a lot of fun doing it			0
" i do n't have a down - on - my - luck story , " @entity152 says			0
" i got fat the old - fashioned way -- a lot of eating , a lot of drinking and no exercise			0
" last year , she decided that she had had more than enough fun getting out of shape -- now it was time to put in some hard work to get back into shape			0
at 34 , she took her first swim lessons -- the initial step toward her goal of becoming an ironman			0
she began rowing and running as well , and this year , she says she will prove to friends , family and her community that anything is possible with hard work and determination			0
at 44 , @entity180 has been in school a lot of years -- first in college , then grad school and now working on his doctorate at @entity186			0
through it all , his weight has been up and down ; now , at more than 300 pounds , he 's ready to make a change			0
" i have spent my life in service to others -- encouraging urban high school students to apply , attend and graduate college , and convening a number of activities helping minorities and people of color get involved in civic life , " @entity180 says			0
" however , over the years , i have not been able to really work on my own health and nutrition goals			1
" he says he 's looking toward the @entity205 challenge to help him set and achieve those goals , and overcome a family history of high blood pressure			0
" i look to learn so many things about myself in the process -- my strengths and challenges and how i can approach them going forward in life			0
