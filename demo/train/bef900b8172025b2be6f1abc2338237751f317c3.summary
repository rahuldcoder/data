-- ever since it was discovered in 2004 , graphene has been hailed as a natural wonder of the materials world destined to transform our lives in the 21st century			1
@entity7 's amazing properties excite and confound in equal measure			2
how can something one million times thinner than a human hair be 300 times stronger than steel and 1,000 times more conductive than silicon ? @entity13 asked the head of @entity16 's graphene research department , @entity14 , to explain why graphene is such a special material and what we can expect it to do for us in the future			1
@entity0 : what is graphene ? @entity14 ( @entity23 ) : graphene is a one - atom thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice			1
this special atomic arrangement gives graphene truly unique properties			2
for example electrical currents in graphene move faster than in any other material we know of			1
watch : the secret to making better batteries @entity37 can also move in graphene very fast and it is the best thermal conductor that we have			2
on top of this , graphene is the thinnest material in the world as well as the strongest , much stronger than steel and , of course , much lighter			1
finally , because it is only one atom thick , it is perfectly transparent and flexible			0
@entity0 : what applications will it have ? @entity23 : the very first application where graphene is going to be used is probably as a replacement for ( the relatively expensive metal ) indium selenide in solar cells			1
after that , i think we will see a new array of communication devices that do n't just use graphene but which also use other two - dimensional materials			1
products such as cell phones will be integrated into the likes of the clothes , pieces of paper and in windows			0
another direction is transparent displays			0
basically we are going to have electronic displays embedded almost everywhere , in the windows , in our glasses , in the walls , everywhere			0
to do this we need very thin materials that are also transparent and graphene could be that material			1
@entity0 : when will products containing graphene be available ? @entity23 : it depends on the specific application			2
i believe that the use of graphene in solar cells , displays and so on is probably going to be in the marketplace in a couple of years			2
more complex applications such as computers or cell phones will probably take longer , maybe within five and ten years			2
@entity0 : what challenges remain for researchers ? @entity23 : one important challenge facing graphene is the way the material is developed			1
graphene was isolated for the first time using the @entity102 technique ( where ever thinner strips are peeled off a block of graphite using sticky tape ) and the quantities we can make in large areas still lag behind this method			1
there has been a lot of work to try and enhance the manufacturability of graphene and there are a few techniques that look very promising but they are not completely mature yet			0
the second challenge is that graphene is a material that is only one atom thick			1
anything that you do to it is going to impact its properties			0
we still need to understand better how to fabricate graphene devices and how to be gentle enough not to ( break ) the formula			0
@entity0 : are production methods improving ? recently , @entity128 has demonstrated a single layer of graphene which is 30 inches in diameter			0
so in just a few years we have gone from micro-meter sized flakes all the way to 30 inches			0
the ambition is that one day graphene will be fabricated in the same way that you print newspapers -- in a roll to roll process using the same kind of equipment			0
this will change the entire economics of the electronics industry			0
@entity0 : are there any other materials like graphene ? @entity23 : @entity7 was the first two - dimensional material to be discovered , but it is not the only one			1
now there are more than 10 materials that are all two - dimensional with complimentary properties that could be integrated with graphene to provide extra functionality			1
@entity156 for example is also one - atom thick and instead of being a conductor it is an insulator ( of heat ) , the best insulator we know			0
if you go to three atoms thick we have another material called molybdenum disulfide which is a semi-conductor , like silicon , but lighter and stronger			1
these materials can then be combined in order to fabricate completely new material structures that do n't exist in nature			0
i think that that is a very powerful proposition			0
@entity0 : when will graphene - based products hit main street ? @entity23 : if you look at how long it traditionally takes new materials to make an impact in the market , it typically takes around 20 years			1
we need to be patient but things seem to be moving faster than with other materials			0
i think the next couple of years will see quite significant improvements in the growth techniques and synthesis of two - dimensional materials			1
at a basic research level we are going to see an emphasis on trying to understand what happens when you stack these materials one on top of the other			0
that is going to enable a lot of new understanding which will enable completely new devices			0
i am completely convinced that graphene is going to end up changing our lives			2
exactly how , i do n't know and i do n't think anyone can know for sure but there is nothing thinner , stronger or more suitable to conduct electricity and that has to be useful for many important things .			2

graphene is the world 's first two - dimensional material to be discovered
no material is stronger , thinner or more conductive than graphene
