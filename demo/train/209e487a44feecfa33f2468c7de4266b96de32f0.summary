-- typical solar power plants stop working when the sun sets , but a new one in southern @entity3 , called @entity4 , can stay awake all night			1
" during the day we capture the energy of the sun and we store that energy into a tank , " said @entity6 , a mechanical engineer who helped put @entity4 into operation			2
" then , whenever we want , regardless if it is day or night , we convert that energy into electricity			2
" located just outside the quaint village of @entity17 ­ a , @entity4 bills itself as the world 's first commercial - scale concentrated solar power plant ( @entity22 ) that uses molten salts receiver technology			1
2,650 large mirrors called heliostats direct the suns rays to a receiver at the top of @entity4 's 450 - feet tower that shines like a beacon during the day			0
the stored energy can generate electricity for 15 hours without the sun shining and according to @entity6 the plant can provide @entity35 of power , enough for a town of about 100,000 people			1
from the receiver the salts are heated to enormous temperatures ; around 250 to 300 degrees celsius when it 's considered relatively cool , but when the molten liquid is pumped up the tower to soak up the sun 's heat directed to the receiver , the temperatures exceed 500 degrees @entity47			2
those energy - storing salts are a combination of 60 % sodium nitrate and 40 % potassium nitrate and are so hot that they are always in a liquid form			2
according to @entity6 each pound or kilogram of molten salt is able to store up to three times the amount of energy that can be stored in oil , an energy - store that is used at other @entity22 power plants			1
at twilight , the plants heliostats are rotated into a horizontal position , as if to get a night 's rest , but the remainder of this solar plant keeps working			1
when the salts cool , they release energy that is used to produce steam , which turns turbines and generates electricity that is transferred to a general grid hookup at the plant			1
the $ 325 million plant began production last may and is a joint venture , between the @entity3 engineering and construction firm @entity79 that owns 60 % and investment partners from @entity84 's @entity83 energy company			1
the official inauguration is set for october 4 , due to be led by @entity3 's @entity86 and @entity84 crown prince sheikh @entity87			0
by the end of 2012 @entity4 expect to reach 70 % of full capacity			0
that , says the owners , is a rate of producing electricity comparable to conventional power plants and a rate they hope will make the plant very competitive			0
however this plant , and @entity3 's solar industry , still gets government price subsidies for the electricity it sells			1
" our vision is that those subsidies will disappear soon , " @entity6 said			0
" by constructing plants we are reducing the cost			0
at the same time , the gas prices , the oil prices , we are sure that they will go up , so there will be a certain time that we do n't need any subsidy at all			0
" @entity111 ca n't say exactly when , but he 's sure this commercial - scale solar plant providing electricity around the clock will help .			0

solar power plant that can operate at night is first of its kind
uses molten salts to store energy captured during daylight
can run for 15 hours without need for sunshine
power plant in southern @entity3 can produce energy for 100,000 people
