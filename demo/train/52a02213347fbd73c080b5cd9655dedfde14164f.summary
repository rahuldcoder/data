-- the @entity1 , the @entity2 terrorist group that wreaked havoc in @entity4 in the 1980s , has admitted defeat and seeks to negotiate an end to its war with the government , one of the group 's top leaders told a nongovernmental organization			1
reporters working for @entity14 on wednesday published a far - ranging interview with " comrade @entity16 , " who said his real name is @entity19 , though the government has disputed that			1
at its peak , the @entity1 spread terror in the country through a bombing campaign that targeted buildings and infrastructure such as electricity towers			0
throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the government fought a campaign that greatly reduced the capacity of the terrorist group , but it made a resurgence in recent years			1
but the government has responded forcefully to the resurgent @entity1 , and the leader said that the time for armed conflict is over			1
the @entity1 has been defeated , @entity16 said			1
" yes , that 's a fact			0
we are not going to deny it , " he said			0
the insurgents have not given up their ideology , he said , but in practice , a war with the government is no longer an option			1
what the group wants is to negotiate with the government a deal that would result in members ' laying down their arms in exchange for the release of prisoners			1
" we do n't have the smallest intention to brandish the weapons of war , of armed conflict			0
sincerely ... we want a political solution ; we want this to end , but through the methods of a negotiation , " he told the reporters for the @entity14 , known as the @entity65 , the initials for its name in @entity68			0
. @entity16 suggested a truce as a first step toward demobilization , and suggested a group like the @entity75 or the church to act as a mediator with the government			1
since as early as 2003 , the @entity1 has sent feelers out to several @entity4 administrations in an effort to begin negotiations , he said			2
in recent months , the group has invited the government of president @entity85 to enter into talks			2
but the answer the terrorists have been met with -- unconditional surrender , laying down of arms , and coordinates for stockpiles -- is untenable , @entity16 said			1
the government even offered him reward money for turning himself in , so that he could leave the country after he disbands the group , he said			2
" by principle , i can not accept that , " he said			0
for the @entity1 , its leader remains @entity100 , who has been imprisoned since 1992 and is serving a life sentence			0
any truce that does not include his freedom would be a " betrayal , " @entity16 said			2
no concrete steps have materialized with @entity85 's government , but the terrorist leader has not given up hope , he said			1
the group 's intentions are for a lasting peace , @entity16 told the @entity65 interviewers , but it was n't clear that meant forever			1
" by principle we are @entity117			0
we believe that the only way to change a capitalist system is with a socialist system			0
but that is not possible at the moment			0
and if it 's not possible , what corresponds in this moment is to end " the armed conflict , he said			0
the " moment , " one presumes , could change			0
indeed , @entity16 said he believes that class struggle will continue , though the war will not			1
for now , the group 's ideological fight will be political , he said , noting that it meant accepting , to a degree , participation within the confines of a democratic system that @entity1 opposes			1
" that is the political trend we have as a nation , ( and ) as @entity4 , we have to accept it , " he told the @entity65			2
do n't expect the @entity1 to field candidates for @entity141 , @entity16 said , but there exists the possibility that other political organizations , representing its views , could participate in the system			2
according to him , the one thing that 's definite for now is that " there will not be any type of attacks			0
" @entity4 with memories of the turbulent ' 80s will no doubt take that guarantee with skepticism .			0

" @entity16 , " a leader of the @entity4 terrorist group , says it 's lost long war
the @entity2 group wants to negotiate with the government , he says
the government has *rejected* anything short of complete surrender
