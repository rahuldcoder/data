-- the family of @entity2 , the 10 - year - old girl whose quest for a lung transplant prompted a change in national transplant policy , said thursday her first biopsy shows no rejection of her donor lungs			1
@entity2 , who was born with cystic fibrosis , had the lung transplant june 12 and is still unable to talk because of tubes in her throat			1
but in a video shared by her family thursday -- the first one since her surgery -- @entity2 waves and mouths " hi " and " i love you " to her mother , sitting off camera			2
the family said @entity2 had surgery wednesday to fix her diaphragm to support her new lungs			2
the biopsy was taken during the operation , they said			0
" @entity2 had a nice , stable night , " the family wrote on a @entity32 page set up for @entity2			0
" her pain is increased , but they seem to be able to manage it			0
overall she seems relieved the surgery is over , sitting waiting yesterday made her very anxious			0
" the diaphragm surgery was @entity2 's fourth in less than a month			1
shortly after her lung transplant june 12 , the donated lungs failed , and @entity2 had emergency surgery to put her on a bypass machine that took over the work of the lungs			1
@entity2 received a new set of lungs three days later			2
her family explained later that the first set of lungs was in poor condition when @entity2 received them , but they decided to proceed with the surgery because " @entity2 was out of time to wait			1
" the second set of lungs was infected with pneumonia , but again the family went ahead with the transplant because " they were @entity2 's best and only hope			1
" since then , the family says , her lungs have improved with each day and continue to work better and better			0
@entity2 was on the transplant list for children 's lungs for 18 months			1
she was n't able to qualify for adult lungs because she was too young ; the agency that oversees transplants , the @entity68 and @entity70 , had a policy that children only 12 or older could be prioritized for adult organs			0
the family petitioned @entity76 secretary @entity75 to change the rules so @entity2 could qualify for adult lungs			1
they argued the rule was unfair , and several lawmakers also asked @entity75 to act			0
on june 5 , the @entity82 asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block @entity75 from having the organ network apply the rule			0
the judge granted the injunction and ordered @entity75 to direct the network to waive the rule in @entity2 's case			2
the family said they never asked that @entity2 be placed in front of anyone on the transplant list who was in a more serious condition			0
days later , the organ network approved a change to their policy to allow lung transplant programs to request additional priority for younger transplant candidates			1
the change is effective for a year , when it must be approved by the board of directors .			0
