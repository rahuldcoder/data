@entity0 is not renowned for its golfers , or its golf clubs			1
most of its population of 170 million can not afford to play a sport that is , in most countries around the world , the domain of the moneyed classes			2
golf is , however , a measure of a society 's aspirations -- and one @entity0 province is aiming high with a development that could mark it as an international destination			1
" an up - to - date standard golf course becomes relevant in an economy like ours in @entity0 , that is growing rapidly , " @entity19 's governor @entity18 told @entity20			1
" we now see a new emerging middle class , what they used to call the yuppie class			0
the yuppie generation is here , and they play golf			2
if @entity33 has something to offer , and they come to @entity33 , then the people in @entity33 benefit from that expenditure			0
" in the 18th century , @entity19 's capital @entity33 was at the center of the african slave trade , with over a million people shipped across the @entity39 from its ports			1
it now describes itself as the " @entity41 , " due to its lush surrounding rainforest and the picturesque @entity43 that borders the east of the city			2
and in the middle of this jungle , in an old rubber plantation , its government has committed $ 200 million to develop a golf complex that will help boost the region 's economic growth			1
" this is part of a wider development , including a conference center , hotel down on the river and some housing , " says @entity53 , a golf architect with @entity54 , @entity55 & @entity53 , the firm overseeing the design and construction of the course			2
" the vision from the governor was to create an international destination for @entity0			1
we 're starting the golf course off in an old rubber plantation			2
we do n't try to clear the whole forest ; we selectively clear the golfing corridor			0
" what we 're trying to do is create a golf course that will look like it 's been here for a long time			1
" environmental impact ? however , some environmentalists are concerned that the construction of golf courses in @entity19 could be damaging to the tropical rainforests that stretch through the region			1
they are home to endangered species such as the @entity85 , and conservation groups believe the natural beauty of the region should be the focus of development , not sport			2
" this state has something that is unique , " says @entity91 , co-founder of the @entity92 , a non-profit trust which seeks to protect wildlife			0
" we have a forest that no other place in the country has , and we should be very careful that our development goals do not in any way harm the resource that makes it a paradise			0
" the @entity19 forestry commission describes the region as the " environmental capital of @entity0 " on its website			1
" we pride ourselves as a biodiversity hotspot , and we want to maintain that , " commission ceo @entity109 told @entity20			0
" our development should be based very seriously on the niche that we have , which is the rainforest			2
" growing the game there are only about 200,000 golfers in @entity0 , an oil - rich nation which has high levels of poverty			1
there is just one 18 - hole golf course in @entity19 , and it is far from a luxury resort -- with its putting greens made of dirt , not grass			1
@entity53 arranged for golf 's main ruling body , the @entity127 , to donate 20 sets of clubs after hearing that kids hit balls around with sticks			1
its club pro @entity134 , who started out as a caddy for one of the members , partly relies on funds from a mentor to be able to play in @entity0 's few tournaments			1
" most of the big players in @entity0 get help from sponsors , " he said			1
across the state border in @entity148 , @entity146 is the home of @entity150 -- a much more upmarket golf club managed by global sports group @entity152			0
it stages amateur and pro events run under its own initiative as there is no official tour structure in @entity0			2
" there are not as many tournaments as we would like , perhaps 10 per annum , " a golf professional named @entity160 told @entity20			0
his colleague @entity164 added : " we need teachers to concentrate on bringing these young boys who will take over from us , because most of the time they concentrate on playing events			0
" @entity0 golf needs an overhaul the grassroots up to the top , says @entity150 's general manager @entity174			1
" we need to get the @entity175 of @entity0 stronger , " he told @entity20			2
" we need to get the @entity176 organized			0
every other amateur body of golf around the world controls the amateur golf -- here there is no control			0
" future generations in the capital @entity185 , home to 17 million people , there is a new premier golf development called @entity188 " when you look at the trajectory of growth of golf as a sport in @entity0 , i think for many years to come will outstrip supply , " says managing director @entity189			1
" as more facilities like this , which are of championship standard , come up then it becomes an easier sell for corporates to get involved in the project			0
" also in @entity185 , the established @entity204 golf club is leading the way in creating new generations of golfers			0
it started a juniors program four years ago which has led to graduates playing in overseas events			0
" the most important thing is to catch many children , so that they are interested and we can improve the quality of membership in golf , " says its club captain @entity212			0
@entity19 's government has already moved to encourage more youngsters to take up the sport			1
" i 've given approval for them to recruit new coaches at the existing facility , " @entity18 said			0
" we 've introduced programs for training in golf at our secondary schools and i believe that it is catching on			0
we believe it is important we build a culture of golf			0

@entity0 's @entity19 government is investing $ 200 million in a golf resort
it wants to *attract* tourists and help the game grow in the region
there are concerns @entity0 's tropical rainforest will suffer
golf is *struggling* to establish itself in the oil - rich nation , which has high poverty
