-- commercial development of the @entity3 's natural resources has so far been near to impossible , but transportation throughout the inhospitable region may soon be revolutionized			1
@entity7 - based airship company @entity6 and @entity9 airline @entity8 , say they have signed an agreement with hopes of establishing a partnership to develop new air freight service across the @entity3 region			1
together they are hoping to deliver standard cargo containers via @entity9 to regions with little infrastructure , such as @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and northern @entity21			1
" it 's a project representing the future of solving the problems of today , " @entity6 ' ceo @entity22 told @entity0			2
" the distribution in the @entity27 as it is right now is inefficient and not logical			0
" managing director with @entity8 , @entity29 , said in a press release that he believes @entity6 will help transform @entity3 transportation forever			1
" we are pleased to begin a partnership with @entity34 and jointly explore the expanding market opportunities in @entity20 , @entity9 , and surrounding @entity37 territories , " @entity29 stated			1
the future of airships @entity6 is developing a new cargo airship , the @entity34 -- a hybrid dirigible combining elements of regular " lighter - than - air " ( @entity45 ) craft and traditional fixed - wing planes			1
as opposed to existing airship designs , this vehicle can control its own buoyancy and is therefore capable of true vertical take - off and landing without requiring external ballast exchange			0
this eliminates the need for a runway , airfields and ground crew , which helps sidestep infrastructure development costs			2
the company , based in @entity59 , had test flights with the @entity61 in september and are now building full - sized prototypes			0
the aim is to have the first vehicle flying by 2016 , and the initial fleet of 24 vehicles up and running by 2020			0
the rigid - hulled dirigible measures 169 meters in length , and has a payload of 66 tonnes ( with plans for a 250 tonne version ) , a cruising speed of up to 120 knots , and a range of 3,100 nautical miles			0
one of the @entity34 's biggest advantages is that it offers significant fuel savings since it runs on regular diesel , rather than expensive aviation fuel which can be tough to get hold of in more inaccessible regions			1
the primary focus will be logistical , moving cargo , troops and disaster relief supplies into remote and inhospitable terrain			2
but the company says that there may also be other uses for the technology in the future , like " floating hotels " to " sky yachts for millionaires			0
" global game - changers @entity22 says he hopes the relationship with @entity8 will benefit both partners			2
" they are a very innovative airline			0
someday they will be our partner ; they know the area , and we will be able to do some unique deliveries , " the @entity100 - born engineer says			0
" it can be everything from delivering the oil rigs to @entity20 to bringing milk from @entity111 to a @entity21 @entity3 post			2
" not only could @entity8 and @entity34 be global game - changers of how air freight services are operated -- the partnership could potentially transform @entity9 into an important business and aviation hub			1
" you can imagine that if @entity9 becomes the base for the @entity3 distribution system , you are creating a new industry in @entity9 , which means new jobs and business opportunities , " said @entity22			1
" it would be a high - tech industry			0
the @entity34 has a green footprint and could provide a normal lifestyle to those living in remote areas			1
we could be creating a whole new understanding of what the @entity3 is			0

@entity6 and @entity8 are to team up to develop new air freight service across the @entity3
@entity6 ' new cargo airship , the @entity34 , requires no runway and can access remote terrains
the two companies want to deliver standard cargo containers via @entity9 to regions with little infrastructure
