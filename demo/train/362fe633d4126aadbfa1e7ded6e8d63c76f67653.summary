-- at a time when the budgets for sci - fi films are , like the universe itself , expanding at an astronomical rate , @entity1 decides to go small			0
the franchise 's third entry shrinks back from the baroque , byzantine space opera of 2004 's " @entity12 , " placing @entity14 's interstellar criminal in a story that 's more similar in scope to the series ' first film , the smart and stylish " @entity19 " ( 2000 )			1
abandoned on a sere , hostile planet , the laconic antihero subsists off the meager landscape like a muscle - bound @entity24 until an ensemble of bounty hunters and soldiers ( including " @entity29 's " @entity30 ) arrive looking to put his head â € ” with those superpowered , see - in - the - dark eyes â € ” in a box			1
@entity1 , co-written and directed by @entity34 , scavenges a variety of genres for parts , morphing over the course of its run time from survival story to slasher film ( as @entity1 hunts his hunters one by one ) to a climactic @entity45 siege by slithery , slavering creatures			0
@entity34 succeeds in staging moments both tense and funny , but they 're fewer and farther between than one would hope , and the dialogue is served up with a heaping helping of cheese , especially when delivered in @entity14 's low - frequency growl			0
still , by aiming more for suspense than bombast , the modest intentions of this threequel make its failures appear more modest as well			0
