@entity0 -- @entity2 returns to @entity0 on monday after a monthlong summer break to jump right into debate and votes on a resolution giving president @entity7 the authorization to strike @entity9			1
how this all will unfold over the coming week is far from certain , but here 's how things could play out : monday the @entity13 and @entity14 are in session at 2 p.m. senate majority leader @entity16 is expected to take the first procedural steps to overcome an anticipated filibuster over whether to officially take up the @entity9 resolution			1
@entity20 sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , who filibustered @entity23 's confirmation as @entity25 director earlier this year to protest @entity7 's drone policy , told @entity27 on sunday that he was weighing his options on how to stall the resolution			0
@entity30 : @entity7 is losing support on @entity32 @entity7 will give a preview of his address to the nation when he does a round of interviews with major tv and cable outlets			0
@entity1 's @entity40 will report on his interview with the president on " @entity43 " at 6 p.m. et. @entity44 : @entity7 faces big hurdle convincing public on @entity9 all @entity13 members get an intelligence briefing from secretary of state @entity49 , secretary of defense @entity50 , national security adviser @entity52 , @entity54 chairman @entity53 and director of national intelligence @entity55 at 5 p.m. et. @entity57 will also brief members of the @entity59			0
tuesday debate expected in the @entity14			1
@entity7 goes to @entity32 to meet with @entity61 on @entity9			0

@entity49 , @entity79 and other administration officials will brief all members of the @entity14			0
@entity82 : this is not @entity84 or @entity85 after that ? what follows could be dictated by complicated parliamentary rules , the legislative strategy of supporters and opponents and other unforeseen variables that could influence the timeline of the debate			1
it 's not clear how long the debate could last , but at some point @entity16 would move to end it if he thinks he has the necessary 60 votes			1
that could be the most significant vote of the week , because if it passes , it would send a strong signal that the resolution would ultimately succeed because final passage requires only a 51 - vote simple majority			1
