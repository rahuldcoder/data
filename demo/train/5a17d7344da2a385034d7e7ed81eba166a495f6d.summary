-- @entity4 hot dog eating record holders @entity2 and @entity5 " @entity10 " @entity1 engaged in a pre-meet stare down friday as they weighed in for the annual @entity9 hot dog eating contest			1
but for the first time , @entity2 -- who two years ago ate 68 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes -- and @entity1 -- the top female eater , with 41 hot dogs and buns -- will not compete directly at @entity17			2
in a move to increase the contest 's fame , @entity18 's is sponsoring separate male and female competitions , in effect setting the plate for @entity1 , a @entity25 manager who reigns supreme among female hot dog eaters , to finally capture her own championship belt			1
it is pink , unlike the men 's mustard yellow belt , to promote @entity32 , another event sponsor			2
male and female contestants will vie for equal purses of $ 20,000			1
the annual display of conspicuous consumption is a marketing marvel that captivates the media and has propelled @entity40 to seven consecutive years of higher revenues and profits			1
during its most recent fiscal year , @entity18 's sold about 453 million hot dogs , a 93 % increase during the seven - year span , giving it bragging rights as the no. 1 selling beef hot dog at retail outlets across the @entity53			1
the company , which is public , has seen its shares rise three-fold during the same period			0
" this is one of the greatest marketing stunts ever , ever put forth in the @entity53 , " proclaimed @entity56 , president and chief operating officer of @entity40			1
" it 's been a great marketing strategy for us			2
" so great the @entity9 hot dog eating contest and more than a dozen qualifying matches around @entity65 comprise the majority of @entity40 marketing budget			1
the company airs no television commercials			0
the hot dog eating contest is a natural for @entity18 's , which first opened by the fun - filled amusement park 96 years ago			1
in the late 1970s the contest was just another @entity17 sideshow , thought up by pr stunt man @entity76			2
@entity56 , a young @entity18 's employee in 1977 , remembers creating the competition with @entity78 in front of the @entity17 restaurant			1
" we waited for a couple of fat guys to walk by			0
we asked if they wanted to eat hot dogs in a contest			2
we ran a quick little contest and the whole object was to get a photo in the @entity91 , " recalled @entity56			0
@entity78 's protégé , @entity92 , his brother @entity93 and partner @entity94 are the marketing mavens who have brought competitive eating -- or gastric - centered sports , as they like to call it -- into the modern era			2
the marketers introduced the coveted mustard yellow championship belt , arranged for @entity104 to telecast the competition live , built up the rivalry between former champion @entity107 and current champ @entity2 , and have promoted the " eaters " as professional athletes			0
" it 's absolutely a sport and it has the attendance of a sport , and these guys are athletes for sure , " claimed @entity93			0
practicing what they preach , the @entity116 have packaged @entity18 's hot dog eating competitions , as well as other disciplines including oysters , hamburgers , cheese steak , baby back ribs , buffalo wings , gyros , jalapenos , asparagus , meatballs , sweet corn , catfish and corned beef into a league : @entity134			1
" the @entity134 circuit goes on all year and hits all kinds of towns , markets and various foreign shores , " said @entity93 , who said he believes his marketing technique breaks through the clutter of traditional advertising and public relations			0
" there 's so many things you can make competitive , compelling , and then use those as a platform for all these brands looking for eyeballs			0
" this year 's lead stunt for the @entity116 is an effort to create a rivalry between the @entity53 and @entity154 by bringing @entity154 eaters to @entity17 for the @entity9 contest , just when @entity18 's happens to be embarking on a major expansion in @entity154			1
the company recently concluded a deal with a franchisee who plans to open 80 @entity40 outlets in @entity154			1
" they represent a potential threat to our possession of the mustard belt , " warned @entity92			0
" @entity154 is expanding and rising as a political and global power , economic and otherwise			2
if they take the belt it 's going to hit us right where we breathe			0
they are going to be eating our lunch , literally			0
" champion @entity2 appeared to take @entity93 's claim seriously			0
at friday 's weigh - in he confronted one of the @entity154 eaters , asking , " how many are you going to eat ? " " i hope 20 , " came the response			1
a clearly relieved @entity2 then offered sportsmanlike encouragement , " next year you 'll eat more			0
" the record holder then confessed he could use some tough competition			0
" if someone 's not pushing me it 's hard , " he said			0
it appears unlikely @entity2 will have that motivation at the big table in @entity17			0
while the @entity18 's competition is under way in @entity192 , @entity2 's chief nemesis @entity107 plans to stage his own hot dog eating performance at a bar in @entity196			1
he was banned from the @entity18 's event last year after a contract dispute and then arrested after trying to jump onto the @entity17 stage , generating even more publicity for the eating contest and for @entity40 .			1

annual @entity9 eating contest increases sales for @entity40
this year the contest splits into male and female divisions
contest adds competitors from @entity154 , where @entity18 's franchises are opening
