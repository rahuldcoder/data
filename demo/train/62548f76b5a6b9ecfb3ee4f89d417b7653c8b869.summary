-- residents of the @entity3 voted overwhelmingly to remain a @entity4 , an official said late monday			1
the question put to voters was : " do you wish the @entity3 to retain their current political status as an @entity4 of the @entity9 ? " more than 99 % of voters said yes , according to @entity10 , public relations manager for the @entity3 government			1
just three people voted no. @entity13 was 92 %			1
" speaks for itself , i think , " @entity14 said about the vote			0
monday marked the final day of a two - day referendum on the disputed @entity3 , which @entity18 call @entity3			1
" my vote is yes			0
... i believe we are like other people in the world , and we are entitled to determine our own future			0
... i think it 's dreadful that someone like @entity18 should be trying to deny us that , " @entity26 , a member of the @entity27 , said before results were announced			2
" they obviously do n't care what their own people think , but worldwide , everybody has the right to determine their own future and why should we not be the same ? " pictures at the polls showed some residents of the islands draped in @entity41 flags as they cast their votes			0
cars displayed banners that said " we 're @entity4 and proud			2
" a parade honoring @entity4 heritage marked the start of voting sunday			2
the referendum was supported by the @entity4 government			2
but the @entity50 in @entity51 said friday that the referendum had no legitimacy , characterizing it as " a further attempt by the @entity4 to manipulate the question of the @entity3			1
" because the area around the @entity3 is the subject of a sovereignty dispute , it argues , " the @entity9 has no right to alter the legal status of these territories , not even under the guise of a hypothetical ' referendum			1
' " renewed tensions the two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then - military government in @entity18 landed troops on the islands			1
@entity18 put its death toll from the conflict at around 645			0
@entity9 says its civil and military losses amounted to 255			0
for more than a year , renewed rhetoric between @entity18 and the @entity9 over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch , with both sides accusing each other of colonialism			1
prince @entity82 's military deployment to the islands last year further fueled tensions , drawing sharp criticism from @entity18 officials			1
in january , @entity18 president @entity87 wrote an open letter , published in the @entity4 press , calling on @entity9 to hand back the islands and accusing it of blatant colonialism			1
" the @entity18 on the @entity3 were expelled by the @entity93 and the @entity9 subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule , " she wrote			1
" since then , @entity9 , the colonial power , has refused to return the territories to the @entity18 , thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity			1
" she cited a 1965 @entity103 resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and has called on the @entity4 to abide by the resolution			2
the @entity4 government accuses @entity109 of trying to coerce residents into becoming part of @entity18 through intimidation of those involved in fishing and oil exploration , and efforts to isolate the remote islands even further by limiting access by sea			1
@entity4 officials have rejected @entity122 's call for negotiations , saying the people of the @entity3 have chosen to be @entity4 and " have a right to self - determination as enshrined in the @entity127			1
" " there are three parties to this debate , not just two as @entity18 likes to pretend			0
the islanders ca n't just be written out of history , " read a statement from the @entity132			0
" as such , there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the @entity3 unless and until such time as the islanders so wish			2
" residents react located in the @entity144 , about 480 kilometers ( 298 miles ) east of the tip of @entity143 , the @entity3 have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources , including lucrative fisheries and a growing oil drilling industry			1
the islands , which raise their own taxes but rely on the @entity9 for defense and foreign policy , are one of 14 @entity4 and have been under @entity4 rule since 1833			1
more than 2,500 people from more than 60 nations live and work there , according to the government website , as well as forces stationed at the @entity4 military 's @entity160			0
many @entity3 residents are of @entity4 origin			1
about 1,600 voters from the @entity3 were eligible to vote in the referendum , officials said			2
before results were announced , @entity26 said she did n't think the vote would put an end to @entity18 's renewed bid for control of the islands			2
" they 've been saying for ages that they have no intention of recognizing it , whatever the outcome , which i find interesting because they 've been going to horrendous lengths around the world to try and discredit it , " @entity26 said			0
for @entity18 , she said , the islands are a " political football " used to distract @entity18 from problems at home			2
on its official website , the @entity3 government rejects as false the @entity18 government claim that a civilian population was expelled by @entity9 in 1833 and argues for the inhabitants ' right to choose their path			1
" we are not an implanted population , " the government says			0
" our community has been formed through voluntary immigration and settlement over the course of nearly 200 years			0
... we are no more an implanted population than are the various populations of @entity143 whose ancestors arrived as immigrants from @entity205 -- we arrived here as part of the same process and pattern of migration			0
" the islands are economically self - sufficient , the government says , except for the cost of defense needed as a result of " the claim made by an aggressive neighbour			0
" " the @entity3 are a peaceful , hard - working and resilient people			0
our society is thriving and forward - looking			0
all we ask is to be left in peace to choose our own future , and responsibly develop our home for our children and generations to come , " the government says			0
