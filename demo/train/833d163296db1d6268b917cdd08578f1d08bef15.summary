@entity0 , @entity1 -- a young boy sits in his bedroom staring up at the poster of @entity6 hanging on the wall			0
like most kids in @entity9 , a small town in the heart of @entity11 , he is a big fan of the martial arts supremo , frequenting the local cinema which almost exclusively shows @entity15 karate movies or @entity17 films			1
other times the young boy immerses himself in a world of literature reading work from acclaimed writers like @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			0
and while outwardly he may still appear to be a child , the die has been cast			0
" i knew i wanted to be a writer from when i was six , " @entity28 tells @entity2			1
" my dad took me to the local library , i was five or six and i just fell in love with the books			0
" some three decades later and @entity28 has become a celebrated novelist and playwright who most recently moved behind the camera to try his hand at directing			1
a task he seems well suited for after receiving critical acclaim for his directorial feature film debut , " @entity44 , " based on @entity42 's much - loved novel of the same name and starring @entity47 stars @entity45 and @entity48			1
" what really particularly attracted me to ' @entity44 ' was that ... there were these characters -- middle , upper - middle - class characters , educated characters , @entity11 characters -- who i suppose had been seen in quite a few novels set in @entity58 , written by @entity58 , but they had never been seen in any movie set in @entity58 , " says @entity28			1
" i felt it was a great opportunity to bring these people to the big screen , " he adds			0
" i was really fed up of going to the cinema and watching a movie about @entity58 and all you saw were them as victims without any say over their own destiny , " explains @entity28			1
" they just seemed to live this passive existence but that was redeemed only by gifts from @entity73			0
" i felt like i could do a better job than [ others ] had and so i decided that i had to take the plunge and direct			0
" from writer to director talented and ambitious , @entity28 left @entity11 at 22 after studying drama at @entity80 with two novels he 'd written in his luggage			1
" i actually came [ to @entity0 ] because i 'd been invited to a theater festival ... within weeks , i had a publisher , not just in the @entity85 but in @entity86 and in @entity87 and in @entity88 , " he recalls			1
" then i got offered a job to be the literary editor of a weekly @entity11 newspaper in @entity0 so i had actually come with absolutely no intention of staying			1
" shortly after his arrival to the @entity85 , his work was published and he received his first commission from the @entity96 where he was catapulted into arts			1
just three years later -- his career flourishing in playhouses up and down the country -- @entity28 wrote a screenplay which was picked up by the @entity102 , who attached a young up and coming director to it			2
" working with @entity106 was a game changer , " recalls @entity28			2
" i was n't that interested at the time in actually directing anything but i watched @entity106 ... it was a joy working with him , " he adds			0
" i then started directing theater because i think , subconsciously , i was preparing to get into film ... i kept thinking i can do this , i can do this better			0
" behind the camera it was @entity28 's empathy for storytelling -- a trait he has held all his life -- that spurred him to take " @entity44 " and begin a six - year production process from adaptation to the big screen			1
upon completion of his debut film , @entity28 was approached by @entity126 's @entity125 to direct " @entity130 , " a popular tv series aimed at educating viewers on hiv / aids			2
set in @entity132 , the eight - part series follows a group of young people trying to live normal lives as hiv / aids becomes more prevalent in their world			0
@entity28 says this was a project he simply could n't say no to			2
" @entity11 has , depending on which authorities you listen to , between 3.4 million and 4.3 million people suffering from hiv / aids , " says the director			2
" but when you go to @entity11 and talk to anyone about this epidemic , people will tell you , ' we do n't have a problem ' -- there 's a culture of complete denial and i felt it was important for us to do the series to get people talking , " he adds			2
" we also knew from the tv - watching habits of @entity11 , the likelihood was that this 15 - year - old kid was watching it and so was their parent and probably their grandparents ... you 'd have several generations actually having this conversation and that 's exactly what happened			1
" for @entity28 , this is what it all comes down to -- telling stories that matter whether it is on stage or screen			0
" i like telling stories but if telling stories actually has a positive effect on how people live their lives , the better			0
