but since the former @entity11 football coach is being treated with chemotherapy as he battles lung cancer , doctors have decided to keep him in the hospital			1
the source did not say which @entity15 , who turns 85 later this month , is in or how long he is expected to stay there			2
@entity3 lost his job as the @entity20 coach last month amid criticism that he had n't done more when a sexual assault allegation surfaced regarding his longtime defensive coordinator , @entity23			1
according to a biography on a @entity11 website , @entity3 was born december 21 , 1926 , in @entity26 , @entity27 , and attended @entity28			2
he joined the @entity11 football program after graduating college in 1960 , taking over as the team 's head coach in 1966			1
in late october , a @entity11 win over @entity34 -- the 409th in his head coaching career -- propelled @entity3 past @entity38 's legendary former coach @entity37 for the most in @entity40 history			1
a week later , @entity23 -- who coached at @entity11 for 23 years and remained a presence on campus after his retirement in 1999 -- was arrested and charged with 40 counts tied to allegations over a 14 - year period			0
ten additional charges were levied this month			0
an investigative grand jury 's summary of testimony claimed that @entity23 engaged in fondling , oral sex and anal sex with young boys			0

@entity60 and @entity62 , a university vice president , were both charged with one count of felony perjury and one count of failure to report abuse allegations			0
@entity3 was n't charged , saying he did his duty by referring the allegations to his superior , according to the grand jury report			0
but criticism quickly mounted , and @entity11 trustees dismissed @entity3 and school president @entity73 -- who initially backed @entity60 and @entity74 -- days after @entity23 's arrest			1
