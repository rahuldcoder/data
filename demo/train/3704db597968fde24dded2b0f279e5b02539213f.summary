-- during summer , @entity1 seems more fixated on the teen dollar than ever , but every once in a while , a movie comes along to prove that older audiences have n't been forgotten entirely			2
often enough , that movie stars @entity6 , and here she is again with " @entity7 , " a funny , outwardly modest comedy that manages to feel utterly novel by focusing on the sexual and emotional needs of an older woman			1
the promotional campaign pushes the raunch as if this were a @entity16 production			2
you can hardly blame the marketing guys for that ( even if the tv spots do give away the movie 's kicker ) , but it 's a gross misrepresentation of an expertly written , sensitively handled movie with two wonderful actors grabbing the chance to show something honest about a relationship gone stale			2
@entity29 is @entity30 , a crusty accountant who spends his evenings falling asleep in front of his golf shows but does n't see anything wrong with a marriage that has worked quite efficiently for 31 years			1
@entity6 's @entity36 is no feminist , and you would n't call her liberated either , but she ca n't stand the loneliness any longer			1
her husband has n't touched her in years , they sleep in separate rooms , and they do n't talk really , much less kiss			2
summoning all the reserves she has left , she insists on intensive couple therapy , a week in @entity46 with dr. @entity47 ( @entity48 )			1
reluctantly but pragmatically , @entity30 goes along , grouching and grizzling every step of the way			0
a good deal of the movie plays out on the couch , and @entity29 gets the lion 's share of the laughs just by virtue of his orneriness and evident discomfort sharing intimacies with a stranger			1
two strangers , really , because his wife does n't have a clue about feelings he 's barely admitted to himself			0
@entity29 has played his crankiness for comic effect often enough over the years , but director @entity68 ( " @entity69 " ) keeps the actors rooted in naturalism , not caricature , and it 's exciting to see @entity29 respond with a performance of discipline and subtlety			1
when he does turn that frown upside down , it 's pure joy , and we finally appreciate what @entity36 must have seen in this selfish bully			0
if we 're honest , @entity6 's also been known to overplay comedy , and yes , she does have to nibble on a banana in one of the movie 's more predictable turns , but at heart this is a lovely portrait of repressed housewife and mother finding the courage to put everything on the line late in life			1
you find yourself gazing at her face for fleeting inflections of optimism , excitement and melancholy			0
@entity48 , you should know , plays his part absolutely straight ; it 's the definition of a supporting performance			1
the writing is sharp enough that the humor does n't need to be forced			0
even in these sexually candid times , there 's still a residual squeamishness where sexagenarian sexuality is concerned			0
screenwriter @entity109 is a producer on " @entity110			1
" in her first produced film script , she strikes a fine balance between comedy and pathos and between the separate but related estrangements that have crept up on husband and wife over the years			0
can such things be cured in a week of counseling and carefully choreographed " sexercises ? " the movie is romantic enough to have us believe it , in part by making it clear that love requires real effort -- and faith -- as well as wine and roses			0
streep fans , i think you 're going to enjoy this one			0
