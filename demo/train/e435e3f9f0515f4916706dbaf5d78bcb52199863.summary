it 's possible the doctor will testify , said @entity56 , an attorney who represented @entity11 earlier in the case			1

" the doctor was first charged in january 2011			0
the case has drawn national attention and sharp criticism from anti-abortion activists			0
but that does n't mean it sets a precedent , @entity1 legal analyst @entity151 said			0
" the testimony in this case was so graphic and so horrific			0
it was described literally as a house of horrors taking place in this @entity0 clinic , " @entity151 said			0
" so i think that most objective observers will say that ultimately this will be an isolated case , hopefully , and that it 's simply a case where prosecutors had to act			2
it had nothing to do with being pro- or anti-abortion			0
" after monday 's verdict , the leader of one anti-abortion group said justice had been served			1
" even as we celebrate this verdict , we honor and mourn as well those among our nation 's weakest children who did not receive ' their day in court ' -- and we must remember that @entity11 is not an outlier within the abortion industry , " @entity174 , president of @entity175 , said in a written statement			1
" we can not allow these ' guilty ' verdicts , welcome as they are , to make us complacent when it comes to the continuing abuses happening even now in abortion facilities throughout our nation			0
" more restrictions on abortions will lead to more cases like the @entity87 , not fewer , abortion rights advocates argue			0
" we thought we had said goodbye to back - alley abortionists , " said @entity195 , head of the @entity196 at the @entity197			0
" legal access to abortion helps counteract " predators " who " prey on vulnerable women , " @entity195 said			0
