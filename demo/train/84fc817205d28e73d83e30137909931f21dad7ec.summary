-- when @entity2 received the letter from her doctor with the results of her recent mammogram , she opened it tentatively , afraid of what it might say			2
her mother and grandmother had both had breast cancer , and she did n't want to suffer the same fate			1
she was relieved , then , when she read this sentence : " we are pleased to inform you that the results of your recent breast imaging examination on 04/16/2009 are normal			2
" a year later , during her annual visit to her gynecologist , @entity2 's relief turned to shock			0
" my doctor felt a lump , and it was so big , she asked me if i 'd gotten implants , " @entity2 , 39 , remembers			0
" i said no , i do n't have implants , and she had me feel it			0
the whole top of my breast was hard			2
" the lump was cancer and it was large -- between 6 and 9 centimeters -- and the disease had already spread to her spine			2
@entity2 says her breast surgeon told her the tumor was probably there when she 'd had the mammogram the year before			1
@entity2 wondered how the mammogram might have missed a tumor so large			2
months later , when she saw the report from the radiologist who 'd read the mammogram , she got her answer			1
toward the end of the report , the radiologist made this note : " the breasts are extremely dense , which lowers the sensitivity of mammography			1
" in layman 's terms , this meant @entity2 's breast tissue was so thick with fibrous tissue and milk ducts that it was hard to see any cancers that might be there			2
" think of the breast as the sky , " explains dr. @entity64 , the chief of breast imaging at the @entity66			2
" on a clear day , you can see objects in the sky			0
but when a breast is dense , it 's like a foggy day			1
there are objects in the sky , but you ca n't see them			0
" one woman 's breast cancer milestones not only is it hard to see cancers on a mammogram of a dense breast ; just having dense tissue makes you more likely to get breast cancer , @entity64 adds			1
" i wish i had known all this before , " @entity2 says			0
" this was a very important piece of information			0
" unfortunately , @entity2 's story is n't unusual , says @entity90 , spokeswoman for the @entity91 , a group of young breast cancer patients and survivors			1
" we hear about situations like this all the time , " @entity90 says			0
" mammograms are not a perfect screening tool -- far from it -- but for young women especially , they are often not helpful at all			0
" here 's how to know when a mammogram might not be enough for you			0
if you have a strong family history of breast cancer , get an mri			1
the @entity107 recommends that women with a strong family history of breast cancer get an mri and a mammogram			1
the group also recommends @entity113 ( in addition to mammograms ) for women with a @entity118 gene mutation , or for women whose parent , brother , sister or child has a brca gene mutation			2
@entity64 also recommends getting a digital mammogram , as they are more accurate than a film mammogram			0
if your insurance company wo n't pay for it , you can appeal the decision , noting the recommendation to get one from your doctor and from the @entity107			0
if you do n't have insurance , contact the @entity136 and @entity137 , the @entity138 and your local chapter of the @entity140 for help finding free or low - cost screening			0
get a copy of your mammogram report			1
as @entity2 learned , a letter saying your mammogram is normal is n't always enough			0
ask either your gynecologist or the radiologist who performed the mammogram for a copy of the actual report , and then check it to see if there 's a notation about the density of your breasts			1
if you have dense breasts , consider having an ultrasound or @entity113 the @entity159 recommends that women with dense breast tissue get an mri			1
the @entity107 says that for women with dense breasts , getting either a mammogram and an ultrasound or getting a mammogram and an mri can be more effective than getting a mammogram alone			1
again , if your insurance company wo n't pay for an ultrasound or an mri , appeal the decision , noting your doctor 's recommendation to have one plus the information above			2
look for your bi-rads score			0
your radiology report should include a @entity176 score , which indicates how likely you are to have breast cancer			1
a " 1 " on this scale means your mammogram showed no cancer , and a " 5 " means the mammogram is highly suspicious for cancer			2
" often , a radiologist letter might say everything is fine , when in fact the @entity176 score might suggest coming back sooner or being followed more closely , " @entity90 says			0
usually , a woman never meets the person who reads her mammograms , but you certainly can try			0
" i no longer leave my mammograms without speaking to the radiologist personally , " says @entity90 , whose breast cancer was diagnosed when she was 28			1
" i ask the doctor to come out and tell me to my face that everything is fine			0
" @entity2 , who 's being treated for her cancer , says it 's still not clear to her why her doctors failed to recommend she have an mri despite her dense breasts and her family history			1
she says her radiologist and her gynecologist knew that her mother , grandmother , aunt , great - aunt and cousin had had breast cancer			1
in addition , her other grandmother had ovarian cancer , which is genetically linked to breast cancer			1
she now wishes she 'd asked more questions and used another method of breast cancer detection : her hands			1
" that 's how my cousin found her breast cancer -- she 's an advocate now and even made a video about it , " @entity2 says			1
" in my 20s , i was vigilant about doing my breast exams , but i 'd fallen out of the routine , " she says			0
" there 's a tendency to forget that we have a tool right at our disposal			0
" @entity0 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

if breast cancer runs in your family , get a mammogram and an @entity113
consider getting an ultrasound or an mri if your breasts are considered dense
ask the person who performed the mammogram for a copy of the radiology report
