the most expensive is @entity20 , where a basic night out could cost you $ 121			1
at the other end of the scale is the @entity24 city of @entity25 , where the same night out would run to just $ 23			0
with the exception of @entity29 , @entity27 cities tended to be cheaper , whereas @entity31 cities were more expensive places for wooing your partner			0
@entity35 , a @entity17 strategist , told @entity36 the @entity16 is " a proxy for the cost of living without taking real estate costs directly in there			1
" the @entity16 has been calculated since 2012			2
this year 's date may have gotten a little less romantic , though : last year 's index included the price of a bouquet of roses			0
