@entity1 photographer @entity0 , who leaked pictures of bloody @entity4 bombing suspect @entity3 , has retired , saying thursday on @entity6 's " @entity5 " that he has no regrets			1
" the way i see it , @entity12 , " the retired sergeant said to @entity6 's @entity9 , " there 's no way i could n't do it			0
" @entity0 's retirement comes after a brief suspension , a transfer to a remote overnight patrol job and a negotiated settlement in which he gave up five days of vacation pay , he said thursday			2
the 25 - year police veteran leaked photos of the surviving bombing suspect emerging from the boat where he had been hiding from a massive manhunt after the marathon bombings , which killed three people and injured at least 264			1
he was one of countless @entity31 - area residents stunned and angry about a @entity33 cover photo of @entity3 , taken from one of @entity3 's social media accounts , that @entity0 and others thought depicted the suspect in a glamorous light			1
the image shows @entity3 with long , curly hair , a mustache and goatee , gazing into the camera			0
in contrast with the @entity33 photo , which some said looked like a picture of a young rock star , @entity0 said his photographs showed " the true image of terror			1
" in the images , which he leaked to @entity31 magazine , @entity3 is shown dazed and bloody , a police sharpshooter 's laser sight trained on his forehead			1
" that was the reality , " @entity0 said			2
" the image of that guy in the boat was the true image of terror , not the one that was fluffed and buffed for the cover of @entity33			1
" he and his attorney , @entity63 , rejected claims that the leak could have harmed the legal case against @entity3 , who faces two federal charges in connection with the bombings			0
@entity0 was not acting as a crime scene photographer , and his photographs were never part of the criminal case , they said			2
" sgt. @entity0 would never have done anything to jeopardize that case , " @entity63 said			1
in july , @entity0 , 48 , was suspended with pay for one day for the leak			0
a month later , he was transferred from his job as a tactical photographer at state police headquarters to a rural patrol job working the overnight shift			0
at the time , state police officials said the transfer was not a demotion or a punishment			0
thursday , @entity0 said he does n't hold anything against the department			1
" they had to do something , " he said			0
" i have nothing but high respect for the @entity1 and the men and women i 've worked with for 25 years , " he said			0
@entity0 said thursday he does n't know what he 'll do next .			2

sgt. @entity0 says he does n't regret leaking photos of a @entity31 bombing suspect
photos , not *controversial* @entity33 cover , *revealed* " the true image of terror , " he says
@entity0 , a 25 - year police veteran , says he does n't know what his next move is
