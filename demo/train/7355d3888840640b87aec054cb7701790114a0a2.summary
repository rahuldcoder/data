@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 this week condemned @entity5 's " unnecessary escalation " of tensions between the two nations over disputed islets known as @entity9 in @entity5 and @entity9 in @entity3			1
he was referring to two incidents in january when @entity5 frigates reportedly locked weapons radar onto a @entity3 vessel and a helicopter , a claim @entity5 denies			1
once fire - control radar is locked on , a missile can be fired at the designated target , generating obvious risks of miscalculation			0
at best this is a militarized game of tag but one that could , at its worst , spark wider hostilities			1
when @entity3 indicated that its jets might fire tracer bullets to warn off @entity5 aircraft , a @entity5 general responded that @entity3 should refrain from doing so , as this would be taken as an act of war			1
in this context , there is good reason to be concerned that @entity33 is sleepwalking its way towards war			0
on february 6 , @entity2 told the country 's parliament , known as the @entity38 , " the incident is dangerous conduct that could have led to an unforeseeable situation			2
it is extremely regrettable that @entity5 carried out such a one - sided , provocative act when signs are emerging for dialogue			1
" he added , " i ask the @entity5 side to return to the spirit of mutually beneficial , strategic relations and prevent the recurrence of an incident like this			1
i strongly ask them for restraint so that the situation will not escalate further			0
" the probing has escalated in 2013 as both sides have scrambled jets and patrol boats shadow each other			2
given the perilous state of bilateral relations , and recent efforts at fence - mending , why the radar - rattling ? and why did @entity2 only go public with his concern a week after the latest incident ? the @entity66 initially seemed curiously unprepared for @entity2 's allegations , deflecting questions and suggesting reporters ask the relevant agencies involved			2
but the spokeswomen did say that @entity3 should stop conducting " illegal activities , " meaning the deployment of @entity3 ships and jet aircraft in the disputed seas and airspace around the @entity9			1
@entity5 's @entity78 pugnaciously dismissed @entity2 's allegations as a " self - directed and self - acted farce , " staged in preparation for his visit to @entity82 later this month			1
@entity2 is known to seek closer security cooperation with the @entity84 and has stated that he intends to revise the @entity85 to ease constraints on the @entity3 military			2
it is not clear how @entity2 could exploit the incident to sway the @entity91 administration since it does n't reveal anything about @entity5 that @entity82 does n't already know and worry about			1
the radar incident may indeed play into @entity2 's hands , reminding @entity3 that they live in a dangerous neighborhood			1
but given @entity99 's missile and nuclear testing program , it 's safe to say they already know that			0
the @entity3 media reaction has been predictably outraged , but the @entity104 did point out that @entity5 's actions signal frustration with the @entity3 government 's intransigent position of denying that there even is a territorial dispute			1
@entity3 knows from experience how frustrating this can be as @entity113 also maintains there is no territorial dispute regarding what @entity3 calls the @entity117 , near @entity118			2
when former premier @entity120 recently visited @entity5 , he caused a stir at home when he acknowledged that there is a territorial dispute , prompting the defense minister to call him a traitor			2
so is this merely a case of @entity2 hyping the dangers poised by @entity5 to advance his agenda of constitutional revision ? or is @entity5 upping the ante in a calculated risk ? probably a bit of both			2
revising @entity3 's peace constitution is controversial with voters and @entity2 is eager to gain control of the @entity138 in summer elections			2
since @entity2 has a lock on security issues , focusing on the @entity5 threat has its uses			2
equally , @entity144 is keen to remind @entity0 that this problem will not go away and that it will continue to press its claim to sovereignty and is willing to take disproportionate risks to pressure @entity3 into at last acknowledging there is a dispute			1
in january , a succession of prominent @entity3 politicians visited @entity5 , signaling a thaw in relations			1
@entity155 , head of @entity156 , @entity2 's ruling coalition partner , delivered a letter from @entity2 to @entity159 chairman @entity158			0
@entity158 responded quite positively to @entity2 's call for improving relations and a summit			0
his comments led to a brief toning down of fiery rhetoric in @entity5			2
the incidents also follow @entity5 's efforts to involve the @entity167 in the dispute to determine the validity of its claim that the islands are a natural extension of its continental shelf			1
the radar - rattling also raises questions about who gave the orders or whether the frigate captains were acting at their own discretion			0
@entity182 images notwithstanding , this incident underscores the reality that there are various state actors in @entity5 with varying agendas			1
the problem is that the island dispute has become highly politicized in @entity5 and the genie of nationalism limits room for maneuver			0
emotions run high and in such a context the current dead - end policy is the path of least resistance			0
is @entity33 heading toward war just as @entity199 did a century ago ? there are also parallels with @entity3 's withdrawal from the @entity203 80 years ago in february 1933 over censure of its occupation of @entity206 and subsequent aggression throughout @entity33 until its defeat in 1945			0
@entity5 suffered more than any other country from this rampage			0
like @entity5 today , @entity3 felt that the international status quo was biased and denying what it deemed its legitimate aspirations			1
it decided to modify that status quo by force of arms			0
history does n't repeat itself , but @entity217 reminds us that it sometimes rhymes			0
in 1913 and 1933 , there was a rational expectation that cooler heads would prevail and governments would come to their senses			0
@entity33 in 2013 may not be sliding towards war and @entity5 and @entity3 understand how mutually beneficial relations have been , and how much they risk losing , but we also know the folly of assuming risk away			1
leadership transitions generate risk because new leaders need to project strength , a need that complicates the compromises necessary to lower bilateral tensions			0
the zigzagging of diplomacy and confrontation on display highlights that re-shelving the sovereignty issue and managing this dispute wo n't be easy			0
the increased diplomatic activity is a good sign , and should urgently focus on hammering out a code of conduct in the disputed seas and airspace that can help prevent armed miscalculations			1
both nations have already agreed to establish an emergency hotline and it 's now time to get that connected			0
let 's hope that the various lessons of 1913 and 1933 are absorbed by all the relevant parties , including @entity82 , and @entity33 's two leading nations wake up before a nightmare descends			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			0

@entity5 - @entity3 tensions escalated after incident between respective *navies*
@entity264 : this is a militarized game of tag that could spark wider hostilities
both sides continue to press their claim over the @entity9 / @entity9 islands
code of conduct in disputed seas could prevent armed miscalculations
