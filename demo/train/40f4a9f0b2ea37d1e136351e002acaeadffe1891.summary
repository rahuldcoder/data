@entity0 -- a former middle - school student who was strip - searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her @entity7 appeal thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety			1
@entity12 leaves the @entity7 in april			1
she was 13 when she was strip - searched			2
@entity12 was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs			1
no medication was found , and she later sued			1
the justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued			1
the larger issue of whether a campus setting traditionally gives schools greater authority over students suspected of illegal activity than police are allowed was not addressed fully by the divided court			2
" @entity30 's subjective expectation of privacy against such a search is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing , frightening and humiliating , " wrote justice @entity36 for the majority , likely his last opinion before he steps down from the bench next week			0
but reflecting the divisiveness over the issue , @entity36 said , " we think these differences of opinion from our own are substantial enough to require immunity for the school officials in this case			1
" whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court			0
" i 'm pretty excited that they agreed with me , they see that it was wrong for the school to do that , " @entity52 said from her @entity53 , @entity54 , home after the ruling was announced			1
" i 'm pretty certain that it 's so far less likely to happen again " to other students			0
@entity52 was an eighth - grade honor student in 2003 , with no history of disciplinary problems at @entity66 , about 127 miles from @entity67 , @entity68			1
during an investigation into pills found at the school , a student told the vice principal that @entity52 had given her prescription - strength 400 - milligram ibuprofen pills			1
the school had a near - zero - tolerance policy for all prescription and over-the - counter medication , including the ibuprofen , without prior written permission			1
@entity52 was pulled from class by vice principal @entity83 , escorted to an office and confronted with the evidence			2
the girl denied the accusations			0
a search of @entity52 's backpack found nothing			1
a strip search was conducted by @entity83 's assistant and a school nurse , both females			2
@entity52 was ordered to strip to her underwear and to pull on the elastic of the underwear , so any hidden pills might fall out , according to court records			2
" the strip search was the most humiliating experience i have ever had , " @entity52 said in an affidavit			1
" i held my head down so that they could not see that i was about to cry			0
" @entity36 said @entity83 initially had " sufficient suspicion " to justify searching the girl 's backpack and outer clothing			0
but when no contraband was found , the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear			1
with the help of the @entity113 , @entity52 and her family sued , and a federal appeals court in @entity117 ruled against the school , calling the search " traumatizing " and illegal			1
that court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug - and crime - free classroom			0
the @entity7 found little agreement on key issues			0
justices @entity127 and @entity129 agreed that the search was illegal but would have also made individual officials liable for damages by @entity52			1
" @entity83 's treatment of @entity52 was abusive , and it was not reasonable for him to believe that the law permitted it , " said @entity129 , who was especially forceful during oral arguments in april , criticizing the school 's actions			1
but justice @entity139 took the opposite view : that administrators deserved immunity and that the search was permissible			2
" preservation of order , discipline and safety in public schools is simply not the domain of the @entity150 , " he said			0
" and , common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative			0
" in 1985 , the high court allowed the search of a student 's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes			2
such a search was permitted if there were " reasonable " grounds for believing that it would turn up evidence and when the search was not " excessively intrusive			0
" opinions in 1995 and 2001 allowed schools to conduct random drug testing of high school athletes and those participating in other extracurricular activities			0
the court was being asked to clarify the extent of student rights involving searches and the discretion of officials regarding those they have responsibility over			0
@entity179 , an @entity113 attorney who represented @entity52 , applauded the decision			2
" when parents send their kids to school , they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials , " @entity179 said			1
but school administrators said the ruling does not make their jobs any easier			2
" the home medicine cabinet now poses a serious threat to students , who may take those medications for abusive purposes , " said @entity191 , general counsel for the @entity192			0
" that 's a problem schools are trying to stem			0
" " how they determine now whether the drug is dangerous , whether it 's not dangerous -- that kind of clarity and that kind of guidance , the court did not give us			0
" @entity52 , now 19 , said she has never gotten over her experience			1
" before it happened , i loved school , loved everything about it			0
you know , i had a @entity213 , honor roll , and now , well , afterwards i never wanted to go to school again			0
" she is attending college			0
the case is @entity218 no. 1 v. @entity52 ( 08 - 479 ) .			2

@entity12 was 13 when administrators suspected she was carrying drugs
no medication was found , and she later sued
justices : search was unreasonable , but individual school officials ca *n't* be sued
@entity52 , now 19 , has said she has never gotten over her experience
