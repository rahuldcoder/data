@entity0 , @entity1 -- what if you could buy a smartphone that would last you for the rest of your life ? this is the dream of @entity10 designer @entity9 , whose ' @entity9 ' concept has captured the public imagination and received celebrity endorsement from the most unexpected quarters			1
@entity9 is a radical cell phone idea that aims to dramatically reduce global electronic waste ( ' e-waste ' ) by offering users the opportunity to upgrade parts -- or bloks -- of their cell phone rather than having to replace the entire device			1
@entity9 says that he came up with @entity9 as a response to the accelerating pace of technological waste : " i do n't like the direction electronics are heading			0
they get more disposable and get a shorter life with every model			0
this gives a lot of e-waste			1
" the environmental campaign organisation @entity34 estimates that global e-waste now amounts to between 20 and 50 million tons a year			1
put into perspective , they say that quantity of waste , loaded onto container trains , would stretch all the way around the world			0
speaking at the cleanup 2013 conference in @entity44 , professor @entity45 , director of the @entity47 at @entity48 , described the growing problem of e-waste as a " timebomb			1
" " [ it ] is the world 's fastest growing waste stream , rising by 3 to 5 % every year , " said @entity45			2
the @entity9 concept aims to decrease e-waste by offering consumers the opportunity to replace individual components of their phone , while retaining the device 's basic frame			1
once constructed , @entity9 hopes that the @entity9 handset will be built from components that can be ' clicked ' together like @entity62			1
each component will have its own function e.g. bluetooth , @entity65 , battery , or camera			0
when a component stops working or needs to be upgraded , it can be quickly replaced with a new ' blok '			0
in theory , @entity9 believes that choosing separate components could enable users to personalize their cell phone to their own specifications , adding an improved camera , increased storage or a larger battery			0
" the idea is to set up a platform which , if used correctly , can reduce the amount of waste significantly , " @entity9 says			2
at present , @entity9 is still a long way from reaching the market -- indeed its inventor has n't even asked for any money to begin developing it			0
for now , @entity87 has simply been gathering support for the concept through the " crowd - speaking " platform @entity90			2
at the time of writing , the @entity9 concept video has received more than 12 million views on @entity97 and been shared on social networks more than 650,000 times			1
the project has also received support from the actor @entity101 and television correspondent @entity102			0
the @entity9 concept is not without its critics			1
some argue that making a device that can more easily be upgraded will increase e-waste rather than reducing it			1
others suggest that it would be impossible to build a functional smartphone in a modular way			2
@entity9 says that at the very least his campaign has shown that there is an appetite for an environmentally friendly cell phone and that even though the concept was only officially launched a week ago " we are already having conversations with some serious players			2
" @entity120 , a @entity121 spokesperson for @entity34 , says that the interest in @entity9 may be useful in underlining the growing prooblem of e-waste : " hopefully the popularity of the @entity9 concept will spark more action from the major manufacturers			1
it should not be beyond the innovative phone companies to make products that are upgradable and designed to last			0
" read more : technology of tomorrow @entity132 , the inventor of the cell phone , told @entity2 that while the @entity9 concept is ' well - meaning ' he suspects it will never become a reality : " the main reason that the @entity9 will not hit the market is it will cost more , be bigger and heavier , and be less reliable ... by the time it could be brought to market , the problem that engendered it will be gone			2
" @entity141 , co-founder of the ' ethically - conscious online retailer ' @entity143 says he thinks @entity9 is an excellent concept , but agrees with @entity132 that it will be difficult to produce : " @entity9 seems such an obvious idea that it makes you wonder why no one has ever taken this approach before ... however it faces two significant challenges - one technical and one cultural , " @entity141 says			2
" to reduce cost and increase battery life as much of the phone functionality as possible is crammed on to a single piece of silicon ... so the technical challenge is meeting the current battery life and size requirements if we are going to benefit from easy upgrades			1
" and culturally ? well we want the lightest phone with longest battery life			0
the @entity9 is likely to have to compromise on that and we will have to change our expectations and our thinking			0
" " however , " @entity141 says " creating a phone that feeds our appetite for upgrades without having to throw away the whole phone would seem to make great sense			0
" @entity171 contributed to this article			0

*phonebloks* concept aims to reduce global e-waste
the invention will ' click together ' like @entity62
global e-waste amounts to between 20 and 50 million tonnes a year
critics argue that modular phones could increase e-waste rather than reducing it
