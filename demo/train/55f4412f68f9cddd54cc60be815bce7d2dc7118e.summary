-- four days after @entity2 was kneed in the back , @entity1 face the real possibility of being booted out of their own @entity5 when they take on @entity8 in the semifinal at @entity10 on tuesday			1
the hosts will have to manage without their star striker after he sustained a fractured vertebra in the 2 - 1 quarterfinal win over @entity15 in @entity16			1
it 's not just in attack that @entity1 have problems -- captain and key defender @entity21 is suspended after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament in the same match , and an appeal was rejected by @entity26			1
@entity2 's injury is a huge blow to the hosts who , under coach @entity30 are looking to reach the final for the first time in 12 years in their hunt for a sixth world crown			1
wild celebrations following friday 's win became more muted when news filtered through that @entity2 -- scorer of four goals in five matches in @entity1 's campaign -- would play no further part in the tournament			1
" it 's like we have lost today , " a female @entity47 fan in @entity48 told @entity0 after hearing of the seriousness of @entity2 's injury			2
" it 's terrible , terrible			0
but let 's go on			0
" @entity55 also came flooding in from fans and arch rivals -- old and new			0
" it concerns not only the @entity47 people but all of us who love football , " @entity59 legend @entity58 told the @entity62 - based @entity61 tv network			0
" it was his @entity5 , in his country			2
" the @entity70 's current playmaker @entity69 also responded , posting a message for his @entity73 teammate on his @entity75 page			0
" @entity2 , i hope you recover very soon , friend ! " @entity69 wrote , while @entity8 midfielder @entity78 tweeted : " @entity2 , i am unhappy			1
" such is the fevered speculation surrounding @entity2 there were even suggestions the @entity73 star could play if he had painkilling injections or underwent emergency surgery			2
that speculation was quickly put to rest by the @entity47 @entity86 monday , who said such treatment would not happen as it would endanger @entity2 's future career			2
dreams of a miraculous return were perhaps fueled by @entity1 's obvious reliance on their stricken star			2
the 22 - year - old talisman has scored 35 goals in 54 international appearances -- three more than the combined totals of the squad 's other forwards -- @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 -- have managed in total in matches for the @entity1			1
" @entity1 are too dependent on @entity2 , " former @entity1 midfielder @entity106 told @entity0 following the group stages			1
" if @entity2 plays well , @entity1 plays well			1
if he does n't , nobody can do his job			0
it 's like @entity112 with @entity113			0
" a member of @entity1 's last @entity5 - winning squad in 2002 , @entity106 also queried whether the current side have the experience to sustain their challenge			1
" when you wear a @entity47 shirt you are under pressure even now when you play in your country			0
i think the players need to know how to deal with that , " he said			0
" all of the players have a lot of experience in @entity129 competition but not in the national team and in the @entity5 -- for a lot of them this is their first @entity5			2
" @entity1 's winning captain in 1970 , @entity133 , struck a more positive note ahead of the @entity8 clash when he recalled the impact @entity137 made when he deputized for the injured @entity138 52 years ago			1
" in the 1962 @entity5 , we lost @entity138 , " @entity133 told @entity139			2
" maybe someone will wake up and become the @entity137 of 1962			0
" another @entity47 great , former midfielder @entity142 , hopes a @entity143 @entity1 can prosper if @entity30 deploys more " combative " midfielders			2
" in my mind , fast players like @entity146 and @entity147 need to be considered ... " @entity142 wrote in @entity150 newspaper @entity149 on sunday			0
" above all , the @entity47 players have the chance to draw energy from @entity2 's sacrifice ... they need to leave their souls on the pitch as a tribute for this kid whose dreams have been shattered because of one horrific tackle , " @entity142 concluded			2
three - time champions @entity8 come into tuesday 's crunch match buoyed by a typically robust 1 - 0 win over @entity165 in the quarterfinals			1
@entity168 's side are seeking a first @entity5 win in 24 years after narrow misses in the last three tournaments			2
in 2002 , @entity8 were runners up to @entity1 -- the only @entity5 meeting between the teams -- before losing at the semifinal stage to eventual winners @entity176 and @entity178 in 2006 and 2010 respectively			1
a hugely experienced squad -- five players have 100 caps or more -- must quietly fancy their chances against an under - strength @entity1			1
not that anyone is saying that publicly			0
" we 're all sad that @entity2 ca n't play , it 's always better when the opponent has all their best players on the pitch , " @entity8 midfielder @entity185 told @entity26			1
" it 'll bring the ( @entity1 ) team together and they 'll want to win the title for him			0
" @entity185 also pointed to the pedigree of @entity1 's coaching team -- noting both @entity30 and technical director @entity198 have previously managed @entity1 to victory ( in 2002 and 1994 respectively ) -- and that home advantage should n't be underestimated			0
" their coaches have a lot of experience of this kind of situation			0
it 's an honor and a challenge to play against the hosts , but it have would be better to play @entity1 in the final , " @entity185 said			1
" it does n't matter how much experience you have , to play the hosts in this football - crazy country , i mean that in a positive sense , is something special			0
" the task of officiating this clash of two @entity5 titans has been handed to @entity222			0
players from both sides will be hoping that he is alert to all incidents -- the 40 - year - old @entity227 failed to spot @entity229 's bite on defender @entity230 when @entity231 played @entity176 in the group stages last month			1
referring to @entity234 's leniency in officiating @entity1 's win over @entity15 -- only two @entity47 were booked by the @entity237 referee despite the @entity1 's 31 fouls -- @entity185 urged @entity222 to be watchful			1
" the @entity47 here are n't the magicians of old , the team has changed and so has their playing style , " said the @entity240 midfielder			0
" hard challenges are definitely are part of their game , it 's something we have to be careful of and the referee too			0
