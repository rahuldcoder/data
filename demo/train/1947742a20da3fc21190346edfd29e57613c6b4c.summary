-- one recent afternoon , @entity1 was helping her younger sister , @entity2 , with her math homework			2
@entity1 , 23 , is not only the eldest of three siblings , but for the past nine years she has also been their parent			2
the @entity5 , including @entity1 , @entity2 , 15 and @entity6 , 18 , are orphans			2
" my parents are gone			1
for me , this is the only family i have left , " @entity1 said from their home in @entity9 , @entity10			2
their father , @entity12 , died 13 years ago in @entity14			1
unable to find a job in her home country to support her children , their mother , @entity15 , decided to move the family to the @entity21 , where she had a sister living in @entity23			1
but @entity15 was struck by a car and killed in february 2005			2
she was 36 years old and @entity1 was 14			2
the children went to live at their aunt 's home , but the situation was less than ideal			1
" it was chaotic , " @entity1 says			2
" they had four kids of their own and it was three of us			2
a couple supporting all those kids ... it was very stressful for them			0
" @entity1 began taking odd jobs to support the family			0
as soon as she turned 18 , she decided to move out of her aunt 's house with her two siblings			0
she became a parent and breadwinner even though she was barely making enough money to pay for food , rent and school			0
" she 's become a second mother and she took on responsibilities she did n't need to , to take care of us , " @entity2 says through tears			0
in addition to living alone and being barely able to survive on what @entity1 made , the @entity5 also faced another challenge : they were undocumented			1
under the law , the @entity58 fell into a category known as " unaccompanied minors , " meaning undocumented immigrant children who have no parents or guardians in the @entity21			1
the number of unaccompanied minors in the country has tripled in the past five years , government statistics show			1
last year , the @entity21 @entity69 took more than 24,481 into custody , compared with 8,041 in 2008			1
the vast majority in 2012 came from @entity14 ( 13,974 ) , but some came from places as far away as @entity74 ( 23 ) , @entity75 ( 16 ) and @entity76 ( 16 )			1
immigration attorney @entity77 says these statistics , compiled by the @entity69 , may be only a fraction of the total			1
" obviously , that 's just the children who are apprehended crossing the border ; new arrivals in theory , so nationwide , who knows how many we have that were n't undetected , that crossed without detention ? " @entity77 , who works at @entity23 's @entity91 , took the case of the @entity5 to court			1
" we asked that the children be found deprived , under state law , and that she ( @entity1 ) be named their guardian			1
with that order the youngest two children were eligible to apply for special immigrant juvenile status and a green card			1
" but what happens to children of undocumented immigrants when their parents or legal guardians die or are somehow missing or unavailable to care for their children ? what happens to unaccompanied minors who enter the country illegally and get caught by immigration authorities ? the @entity112 , under the @entity111 , turns these children over to the custody of the @entity115 within 48 hours of their detention			1
through the @entity118 , @entity115 cares for the children through a network of providers that offer foster care , group homes , shelters and residential treatment centers			1
the average stay in the system is 45 days and , according to @entity115 , 88 % of children are released to relatives already living in the @entity21			1
for now , the @entity5 can stay together			0
@entity1 is focusing on the younger siblings ' welfare and making sure they stay in school and take advantage of the opportunities this country offers			0
" she 's going to school and i know she expects us to go to school and she 's made that possible by doing all these legal things , " @entity2 says			0
@entity1 is majoring in accounting at @entity141 and working at an accountant 's office to support her siblings			0
" family comes first , so that 's the way i was raised that before anything else you have to take care of your family , " she says			0
" so i think that was the main thing			0
now that my parents are gone i have to take care of my family because that 's the only thing i have left			2
" the fight is not over			0
@entity1 's fate depends on a bill for young immigrants known as " the @entity161			0
" but the legislation , officially known as @entity161 , has failed to pass multiple times in @entity164			0
@entity1 , however , says she wants to stay " positive			0
" that 's the only hope she has of keeping the family together			0
and she 's embracing that hope .			0

most undocumented immigrant children without parents in the @entity21 came from @entity14
the official statistics may represent just a fraction of the total number
when apprehended , such children go into a network of *caregivers*
