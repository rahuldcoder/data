-- it 's football training , but not as we know it			2
@entity4 champions @entity3 are boldly going where no club has gone before with the " @entity7 " , a soccer training machine powered by a smart phone			1
winners of the @entity12 title in each of the last two seasons , @entity3 has unveiled the 14 - meter cage which is the brainchild of @entity17 - based designer @entity16			1
once inside the " @entity7 " , a player is fed balls by eight different machines , having to find one of the 72 panels - - lit by a flashing green light -- which make up the space - age contraption before receiving another ball			1
@entity3 hope the device , which can also be operated using a tablet , will improve a player 's technique , spatial awareness and peripheral vision			1
intensity not that @entity3 requires much improvement			2
@entity35 's team sits fourth in the @entity4 top flight and is being heavily tipped for @entity38 success after excelling in a @entity40 group containing @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 , with the @entity46 club 's manager @entity44 viewing them as candidates to win the tournament			1
@entity35 has instilled in @entity3 a non-stop adventurous style of football and the " @entity7 " is the next step in their pursuit of excellence			1
" it ´ s as if you are surrounded by 10 colleagues who are there only to serve you balls , " said @entity3 's @entity55 youngster @entity54 after a session inside the cage			1
" in the course of normal training that level of intensity just is not possible			2
the ´ footbonaut ´ allows you to work on any weaknesses and ensures that you play at pace but with precision			0
" @entity16 claims that after 15 minutes in the cage a player " will have received and passed on as many balls as he would in a normal week of training			1
" repetition and intensity are crucial if you want to conquer a particular skill , whether that be playing football , tennis or learning the piano			0
" perfect tool @entity3 's success in recent years and the performances of players like striker @entity87 and midfielder @entity88 have attracted admiring glances from a host of top clubs			1
@entity93 's @entity92 and @entity94 of @entity95 have both been developed by @entity3 in recent years before being sold on to @entity96 and @entity41 respectively			2
@entity97 is currently on loan at @entity99			0
and former @entity100 coach @entity35 hopes the " @entity7 " can help @entity3 maintain their stellar standards			1
" it is the perfect tool to improve ball - handling skills , " said the 45 - year - old			1
" it demands precise skills used at speed in a physically tough environment			2
it ´ s quite a package ! " echoing @entity35 's excitement , @entity3 's chief scout @entity111 is interested by the cage 's potential to analyze player development			1
" we can closely monitor a player ´ s development with data gleaned from the machine , " said @entity111			0
" there is no reason why a player can not translate the actions practised in this environment onto the actual playing field			0
" caution but @entity127 coach @entity126 , who works with the @entity128 in @entity129 -- the gulf kingdom which will host the @entity131 -- struck a note of caution			0
" one of the major features of high performance is focused attention and that can be trained through this device , " @entity126 told @entity0			0
" brain research tells us that optimal learning requires that skill training must be embedded in the natural environment of an activity			0
this is not the case ( with ' @entity7 ' )			2
" the fact the player must react to a sound is not matching the reality of a game when a player reacts to visual information			0
" and @entity126 questioned the position of the player in the cage			2
" the fact the performing player always stays in the central position is also a disadvantage			0
in a game he has to move and search for the best position to receive the ball			0
" i am also curious to know how one - footed or technically less skilled players are going to react tn the ' @entity7 '			1
for me you need to prepare a player for this kind of resource			0
" @entity126 also raised concerns over the grueling physical workout which the cage gives a player			2
" using sweating as a parameter is not a good approach , " he said			0
" too often coaches think that high intensity delivers high performance			0
brain research tells us that if energy is low , learning will go down			0
" so , while the " @entity7 " is one small step for @entity3 , it could take a giant leap for the device to become a fixture at training grounds across the world .			1

@entity4 champions @entity3 pioneer the use of " space age " training
the " @entity7 " is a 14 - meter cage which delivers balls to a player by eight machines
the player must then pass to one of 72 panels which is signaled by a flashing green light
" it is the perfect tool to improve ball - handling skills , " says @entity3 coach @entity35
