-- sure @entity1 can make the @entity2 vanish in front of a live audience , but what can he do with an @entity6 ? in a @entity12 video posted by " salarymagician , " @entity7 -- who identifies himself as a magician at the beginning of the video -- incorporates the @entity6 in his sidewalk magic act , which just happens to take place in front of an @entity17			1
i 'm not sure what 's more impressive : how well he knows his way around an @entity6 , or how entertaining his magic tricks are			1
different versions of the @entity12 video have already been viewed more than 700,000 times			0
it does n't really matter that many of @entity7 's tricks probably would n't be possible without long sleeves and quick hands -- at one point he takes too long to pull a piece of cheese out of his sleeve			0
he redeems himself twice over when he makes a live dove appear in his hand moments after showing a video of it on the @entity6 screen			1
another highpoint of @entity7 's act is when he pretends to pour a glass of milk onto his @entity6			2
despite the fact that the contents of the glass are clearly staying put , it appears as though the milk has filled the virtual glass on the screen			0
is this really magic ? probably not , but it looks pretty darn cool			0
another cool , yet subtle , part of the video is when @entity7 covers his face with the @entity6			1
his moving face appears on the screen , but he 's wearing glasses			0
when he removes the @entity6 , the same glasses are on his face			2
we should have seen this coming			0
@entity62 ceo @entity61 deemed the @entity6 " a truly magical and revolutionary product " when he unveiled the tablet - style computer in january			1
