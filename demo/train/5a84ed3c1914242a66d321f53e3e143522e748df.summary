-- since president @entity2 seems to be a reflective soul , he must be reflecting on the irony of his latest predicament : as the man who came into office promising to change everything and who instead seems to have let much of what he promised to fix only get worse			1
first , the good news : slowly but surely , the economy is coming back			1
and that 's no small feat , given where it was in 2009			1
then , everything else : the constitutional scholar , civil libertarian and antiwar activist ca n't seem to wake up each day without some basic challenge to his political ecology			2
the confirmed presence of chemical weapons in @entity25 now makes some sort of escalation there inevitable , just as the war in @entity30 winds down			0
( more military support for the rebels ? no - fly zone ? ) the newbie senator who railed against president @entity36 's " warrantless wiretaps " is now defending his own version of government for - your - own - safety intrusion			1
( " no one is listening to your telephone calls			0
" ) he gives a speech defending drone strikes ; he answers questions about the @entity48 's dragnet surveillance of media outlets in its leak investigations			1
he might be forgiven for asking himself @entity52 's infamous vice presidential debate questions : who am i ? and what am i doing here ? @entity0 poll : @entity2 numbers plunge into generation gap now all he has to do is answer them			1
the president has -- rightly -- called for a public debate about the proper balance between national security and privacy			1
but the debate ca n't happen without him			1
in fact , he needs to lead it			2
that 's what presidents are supposed to do when the country is having a national conversation			2
it 's part of the job description			2
in the @entity79 controversy , we 've heard from the leaker , the director of the @entity79 , the director of national intelligence , the members of the intelligence committees			0
we heard a bit from the president , who seems to be saying , in effect , that " i 'm glad you guys are talking about this , because we are going to have to make some tough choices as a society			2
" here 's what we know : the president entered office skeptical of the very programs he is now defending			1
but after vetting them and adding some additional protections , he now thinks they are important , even integral , to our self - defense			0
all of which makes sense to me personally			0
but it 's hard to categorically decide something ( especially when it affects you ) without some more information			2
and if you 're asking people to decide that big brother - ism in some form is ok -- and to trust that you are doing the right thing -- you 've got to give them something to work with			0
remember when @entity36 said " i hope the @entity114 people trust me " ? it turned out they did n't			1
@entity2 bristles at suggestion he 's shifted on snooping in fact , the public 's view of the @entity2 administration 's handling of civil liberties is beginning to eerily resemble what the public thought about @entity36 : forty - three percent in a new @entity0 / @entity128 poll say the administration has gone too far in restricting some civil liberties in order to fight terrorism			1
in 2006 , 39 % thought @entity36 had gone too far			1
that 's the same @entity36 that then - sen. @entity2 excoriated for the " warrantless wiretaps " in 2006			1
but the worst news for the president is that he seems , at least right now , to be losing the benefit - of - the - doubt factor he has enjoyed because people think he 's an honest guy who tries to do the right thing			1
the latest @entity0 / @entity128 polling shows that while 49 % of @entity114 consider the president to be " honest and trustworthy , " that 's down 9 points -- in one month			1
and his approval rating has fallen 8 points to just 45 %			0
the unkindest drop , fueling the entire downward trend , comes from @entity2 's stalwarts , younger voters			1
a huge 17 - point decline among the under - 30 set has got to be some sort of wake - up call			0
now , i know this president does n't like some parts of his job			2
he does n't much like schmoozing members of @entity160 , despite his recent share - a - meal plan with assorted @entity163 types			0
he does n't like the @entity164 - style strong - arming , either			0
he does n't much like the messy lawmaking process in which personal relationships can often mean the difference between getting what you want and getting nothing at all			0
and he does n't ever like to be pushed			0
no - drama @entity2 , remember ? but he does like speeches			1
he likes writing them , redrafting them , pondering them			0
he likes giving them , too -- because he 's good at it			2
the @entity114 people need some quality time here			0
an interview or two , sure			0
declassify some information about thwarted terror attacks that can be shared without compromising intelligence			0
let @entity114 in on the real secret they 're puzzling : how this president has been affected by what he has seen from the @entity187			2
some may buy it ; some may not			0
but letting us in on this secret is just part of the job			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1
