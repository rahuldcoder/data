-- i believe in remakes			0
" @entity4 , " " @entity3 , " " @entity5 " ... each version was a classic in its own time			0
and despite the fact that the recently announced " @entity11 " remake -- most likely -- wo n't hold a candle to the 1987 dance flick , i 'm optimistic			1
with all the buzz surrounding " @entity11 " 2.0 , which will be directed by the original film 's choreographer , @entity16 , it 's easy to forget that this is n't the first reboot			1
in 2004 , " @entity11 : @entity20 " was released			1
and this brings me to my confession : i really liked " @entity20			1
" before you skip down to the comments section and unleash fury , i am aware that " @entity20 " is n't nearly as good as " @entity11			1
" @entity26 and @entity27 do n't even look like @entity28 and @entity30 's understudies			2
but if you take it for what it is , a dance movie with its own spin on a classic storyline , it 's really an enjoyable flick			2
plus , there are some pretty funny scenes -- whether or not they were intended to be comical , i 'm not sure			0
" @entity20 " worked because it did n't try to introduce us to a new baby , a new @entity43 , or even a present day @entity45 resort			1
it took what i have officially dubbed the " @entity49 " approach : same story , different movie			0
" @entity49 , " starring @entity56 and @entity57 , hit theaters just six months after @entity53 and @entity54 's " @entity55			2
" both films featured two friends attempting to engage in a casual , sexual relationship			0
of course , in " @entity11 's " case , 17 years went by before another film adopted the plotline			1
like the original , " @entity20 " is a period piece , of sorts -- it takes place during the late 1950s during the @entity69			1
at the beginning of the film , @entity70 ( @entity27 ) has just moved to @entity73 with her family			2
there she meets @entity76 ( @entity26 ) , a bus boy and talented @entity78 dancer who teaches her some moves			0
just replace a few @entity81 's performances with a @entity78 ballroom competition , and substitute " ( i 've had ) @entity83 " for @entity84 " and you can probably fill in the rest			0
also , i 'm a sucker for movie montages			0
there 's nothing better than watching a series of events play out while simultaneously listening to a catchy track			0
in the case of " @entity20 , " about halfway through the movie , scenes of the couple rehearsing their moves on a rooftop and at the beach are backed by @entity101 and @entity104 's " dance like this			1
" they even have their own , less challenging , version of @entity28 and @entity108 's dramatic lift			0
here 's my point : the movie was n't trying to be the next " @entity11			1
" it was simply recycling a winning formula			0
in the interest of full disclosure , " @entity20 " absolutely bombed at the box office			2
with a budget of $ 25 million , it only grossed about $ 14 million nationally			1
it could have been the relatively unknown cast			0
@entity119 , @entity26 had a budding career in @entity121 before channeling @entity28 in 2004			0
@entity122 and @entity123 appeared in the film as @entity70 's conservative parents			2
maybe people felt protective of " @entity11 , " and chose to rebel against a film that dared to mooch off its name			1
with so many fans already up in arms over @entity16 's impending update -- countless groups opposing the flick have popped up on @entity135 this week -- it will be interesting to see if people make it to the box office			1
i know i will .			0

i have a confession to a make : i enjoyed 2004 's " @entity11 : @entity20 "
with a budget of $ 25 million , " @entity20 " only grossed about $ 14 million nationally
the remake will be directed by the original film 's choreographer , @entity16
