@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 on friday firmly rejected president @entity5 's call for an approximate return to the borders that existed before the 1967 @entity9 war , telling the @entity11 leader that such a move is impossible in light of current security concerns and demographic realities			1
the two leaders pledged to work together , however , in the pursuit of a comprehensive @entity3 - @entity19 peace agreement			2
i want peace , " @entity2 said while meeting with @entity5 at the @entity21			1
but " a peace based on illusions will crash eventually on the rocks of @entity9 reality , " he said			0
" obviously there are some differences between us in the precise formulations and language , and that 's going to happen between friends , " @entity5 said			0
" but what we are in complete accord about is that a true peace can only occur if the ultimate resolution allows @entity3 to defend itself against threats , and that @entity3 's security will remain paramount in @entity11 evaluations of any prospective peace deal			0
" both men stressed that the presence of the militant group @entity44 in a @entity19 government would be extremely problematic for future peace talks			2
the @entity11 and @entity3 consider @entity44 a terrorist group			0
@entity19 leader @entity51 " has to decide if he negotiates or keeps his pact with @entity44 , or makes peace with @entity3 , " @entity2 said			1
" i hope he makes the choice -- the right choice -- in choosing peace with @entity3			0
" but @entity51 ' spokesman said it was @entity2 who was derailing the peace process			0
" these statements are an official declaration that he is not ready for true peace based on justice and international resolutions , " presidential spokesman @entity57 told the @entity59 news agency			0
@entity57 said the @entity19 government independent and has " nothing to do with @entity68 or @entity44			0
what @entity2 is saying are excuses to avoid sitting at the negotiating table , " he said			0
@entity5 's call thursday for an approximate return to the 1967 borders , which made official a long - held but rarely stated @entity11 position , has increased tension between the two longstanding allies at a moment of turbulent change in the @entity81 world			1
@entity3 seized the @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 during the 1967 war			2
the @entity85 has since been returned to @entity87			0
@entity3 annexed the @entity84 in 1981 , a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by @entity90 , which still claims the land			0
@entity44 now controls @entity83 , while the more moderate @entity19 group @entity68 administers the @entity82 , site of a growing number of @entity3 settlements			2
ultimately , the @entity19 are aiming to unite @entity83 and the @entity82 under the authority of a new state			0
the @entity3 government has repeatedly said , among other things , that peace talks with the @entity19 can not seriously proceed without firmer security guarantees and a clear recognition of the jewish state 's right to exist			2
@entity5 said thursday that the borders of @entity3 and a @entity19 state " should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps , so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states			1
" his position largely agreed with the @entity19 negotiating stance on border issues in the staggering peace process , now stalled by disputes over @entity3 settlements in the @entity82 and the role of @entity44 in the @entity19 leadership			2
at the same time , @entity5 reiterated unwavering @entity11 support for @entity3 's security thursday , and he endorsed certain negotiating positions of @entity2 's government , including an incremental handover of security responsibilities by @entity3 when conditions on the ground allow it			1
he also said a future @entity19 state would have to remain " nonmilitarized			1
" @entity5 sought to undercut momentum for a declaration of @entity19 statehood at the @entity131 in september , warning that " symbolic actions to isolate @entity3 ( at the @entity131 ) wo n't create an independent state			1
" the president said he recognizes that two " wrenching and emotional issues " remain unresolved : the future status of @entity136 , which is claimed by both sides , and the fate of @entity19 refugees who claim @entity3 as their homeland			1
@entity2 , considered hawkish on security matters , reacted coolly to the president 's speech			0
he has argued that the 1967 borders are now " indefensible " for @entity3 , and noted that major population centers are located beyond those lines			1
@entity44 also rejected the terms outlined in the speech , calling them " empty of concrete significance			0
" @entity3 , meanwhile , announced the approval thursday of new projects to build 1,500 housing units in @entity155 and @entity156 , which are outside the 1967 borders			1
the projects had previously received initial approval , said @entity158 , an @entity159 spokesman			0
@entity3 officials said before friday 's meeting that @entity2 intended to use the occasion not only to stress his opposition to a restoration of the 1967 lines , but also to seek specifics on the type of security guarantees envisioned by the president , including the assertion that a @entity19 state would remain nonmilitarized			1
@entity2 also wanted @entity5 to clarify his stance on both @entity44 and the so - called " right of return " for @entity19 families who left @entity3 after the state 's founding in 1948			1
@entity3 has repeatedly warned that it can not allow those families to return without sacrificing its identity as a jewish state			2
@entity2 made clear after friday 's meeting that the families of the 1948 refugees can not settle within @entity3 's borders			1
while @entity2 and other conservative members of the @entity3 government have been critical of @entity5 in the wake of thursday 's speech , the president also has defenders within the @entity189 , @entity3 's parliament			1
@entity190 , an opposition leader and former foreign minister , applauded @entity5 's call for a two - state solution			2
" an @entity11 president that supports a two - state solution represents the @entity3 interest and is not anti-israeli , " @entity190 said			2
" president @entity5 's call to start negotiations represents @entity3 's interests			1
" also , the group known as the @entity203 -- which includes the @entity131 , @entity204 , the @entity205 and the @entity11 -- issued a statement friday offering its " strong support " for @entity5 's " vision of @entity3 - @entity19 peace			1
" the @entity21 has been heavily focused on @entity9 issues this week			0
@entity5 met with @entity212 's @entity211 on tuesday and will address the @entity213 , an influential @entity214 lobbying group , on sunday			0
@entity1 's @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
