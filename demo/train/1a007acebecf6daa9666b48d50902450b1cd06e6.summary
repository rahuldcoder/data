-- @entity2 shivers at the memory of a childhood visit to @entity5 , the @entity6 resort which is preparing to stage the first @entity8 @entity7 this week			1
" there was snow and rain , and it was three degrees , really cold , " the @entity8 @entity10 racer tells @entity0			1
" i had to use double gloves to drive ! " i was 10 - years - old and it was my first ever karting race			1
i was very nervous -- but still i managed to win			0
" that maiden competitive victory on the snowy streets of @entity5 a decade ago was a landmark event for the ambitious youngster			2
it may just have planted the icy streak of competitiveness which has earned kvyat the coveted job of replacing @entity25 at @entity26 next season			1
the 20 - year - old will follow in the four - time world champion 's footsteps by graduating from junior team @entity31 after just a single full season learning the ropes			1
" they know what kind of driver i am , " @entity2 told the media in @entity35 , where he was named as @entity25 's successor			1
" i will do my best to prove them right			0
" with his aura of cool confidence , it 's easy to forget that @entity45 is still a rookie racer in the realms of @entity10			1
those within the sport 's inner circles -- as well as his new boss @entity48 - have been impressed with his ability to adapt to circuit conditions and his baseline speed			2
the young @entity8 qualified eighth on his debut in @entity57 and crossed the line ninth , a career - best finish he also claimed in @entity61 and @entity62			1
" i did n't have any problems adapting myself to any of the special conditions , let 's say , " @entity2 explains			1
" i managed to find my pace straight away without losing time			0
it 's true that when i am comfortable with a car i can take the maximum out of it			2
" when asked in the summer if he wanted @entity25 's job leading the senior @entity26 team , @entity2 laughed before adding , " i do n't know			1
" we do know @entity26 is a top team for the world championship ... " @entity2 's future pairing with @entity76 -- the man he replaced at @entity31 this season -- will be an intriguing partnership			1
from the outside the duo look like chalk and cheese			0
@entity76 is the smiley , practical joker with @entity45 the stick - thin straight man			2
the @entity8 is said to be so focused on his ambitions in @entity10 that he does n't even have time for a girlfriend , surely a rarity among @entity10 's leading men			1
@entity45 definitely has a cool head on his young shoulders and refuses to believe any of the hype bubbling around him			0
" obviously you should n't let emotions drive you too much , " he says			2
" i think being calm always helps			0
" you still have to be happy with what you 've done and always keep pushing for whatever it is ( you want )			0
" if it will come it will come , or it will not come			0
" coming round the corner very soon is another lifetime landmark for the boy who grew up in @entity107 , a city he describes as " industrial but nice			0
" on sunday , @entity109 will become the first homegrown racer to contest a @entity8 gp , the newest addition to the sport 's peripatetic calendar			1
" i 'm really happy to be going back , " says @entity2 , who moved to @entity114 when he was 12 to fuel his racing ambitions			2
" the place means so much to me and obviously i hope to give the crowd something to cheer about			0
" it 's important to have a flag on your heart and in your soul and for me that 's the @entity8 flag			1
" @entity8 has had to wait a long time for motorsport to come in from the cold -- 100 years in fact			2
the last @entity8 @entity7 was held in @entity127 in 1914 before the outbreak of @entity129 and the @entity8 civil war pushed motorsport off the national agenda			1
there have been attempts to add @entity8 to the world championship calendar since the late 1970s but it was the @entity136 -- the most expensive in history -- that was to prove the catalyst for a @entity8 race			1
" we got help from the @entity145 , " @entity8 @entity10 television presenter and commentator @entity141 explains to @entity0			1
" it was decided a race track would be would be part of the @entity149			0
" without that the circuit in @entity5 would never have been built			2
president @entity151 himself signed with @entity154 [ @entity153 , the sport 's commercial rights holder ] four years ago			0
" the 2014 @entity145 and @entity157 and the 2018 soccer @entity158 are headline events for @entity8 but @entity10 is still a relatively small sport in a country with a population of 146 million citizens			1
@entity141 , who is the face of motorsport on @entity8 state broadcaster @entity166 , says this season each grand prix reaches an average of around two million viewers			2
" it is not immensely popular , " he says			0
" it 's not ice hockey or the @entity145			0
it 's not such a big story for the government as the @entity158			0
" i hope that changes			0
i 've sacrificed 23 years of my life trying to change the perception			0
every bloody sunday i work on it ! " but the national grand prix is a national grand prix and there is a little bit of pride			0
" if one guy begins to win everything , like @entity189 or @entity190 did , he really can change the perception			0
" @entity45 is n't a household name yet in @entity8			2
the most famous driver is , as in most countries around the world , seven - time world champion @entity189			1
with a future as a @entity26 driver secured , the 20 - year - old surely must believe he has a chance of becoming @entity8 's first title winner ? " i do n't get caught thinking about it too much , " says @entity2 with his poker - face in place			1
" i do my job , i do my best and if my best is enough for it ... of course , it would be nice			0
" he pauses and then , letting his guard down a little , he confides : " i am living for this			0

@entity2 will drive at sunday 's inaugural @entity8 @entity7 in @entity5
the 20 - year - old @entity8 's second ever driver in the @entity10
the @entity31 racer will replace @entity25 as a @entity26 driver in 2015
he tells @entity0 he is " living " to one day be an @entity10 world champion
