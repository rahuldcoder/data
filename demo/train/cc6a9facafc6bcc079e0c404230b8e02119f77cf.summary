@entity0 -- every one of the 3,000 students at @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5 , has met with a guidance counselor and come up with individual goals that include plans for graduating high school and beyond			2
" i 'm surprised by how invested the students have gotten in creating the goals for themselves , " said guidance counselor @entity10			0
while students at @entity3 have thought about their future , many high school students have not , and leave high school unprepared for adult life			0
that transition from secondary school to employability is the focus of a new report released by the @entity23 that advocates a shift in the way the @entity26 looks at college degrees			1
" it is long past time that we broaden the range of high - quality pathways that we offer to our young people , beginning in high school , " according to the pathways to @entity37 report			1
it says that in the @entity26 , too much emphasis is placed on attending and graduating from a four - year college as the only path for success			1
while 47 million new jobs are projected to be created in the @entity26 by 2018 , only a third of those will require a bachelor 's degree or higher , according to the report			1
thirty percent of those new jobs will require an associate 's degree or a post-secondary occupational certificate			0
" in our view , the @entity26 system would be greatly strengthened if the pathways to all major occupations were clearly delineated from the beginning of high school , " the report says			1
this would let students and their parents clearly see what courses of study and other experiences would " best position them to gain access to that field , " the report adds			1
also , the report advocates a larger role for future employers by linking classroom learning to actual jobs through paid internships , and providing more access to jobs related to the students ' field of study while they are still in school			1
the report recommends that future employers work with educators to design programs of study for students			2
" our goal should be that beginning no later than middle school , all students should have access to this system of employer involvement and assistance , " according to the report			2
" unless we are willing to provide more flexibility and choice in the last two years of high school , and more opportunities for students to pursue program options that link work and learning , we will continue to lose far too many young people along the path to graduation , " says @entity96 , who heads the @entity97 at @entity23			2
traditionally , @entity26 students receive career advice from middle and high school guidance counselors , but the report points out that under the current system , the average ratio of students to counselors is 500 to 1			1
the counselors at @entity3 feel extremely lucky to have a ratio of 151 students to one guidance counselor			0
the high school restructured its administration for the 2010 - 2011 school year and added an additional five counselors to its staff of twelve			0
" the lower ratio means the counselors are having access to students in ways we have n't been able to before , " according to @entity131 , the director of secondary school counseling there			0
the additional staff allows them to have more interaction with the students			0
" it 's a different type of feel when you are talking about customizing and personalizing education for each and every child , " said @entity131 .			0
