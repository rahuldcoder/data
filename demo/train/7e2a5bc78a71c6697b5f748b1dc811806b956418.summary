-- motivation is a tricky thing			1
we need it in every aspect of our lives : to get up in the morning and go to work , to start ( and finish ) that 10 - page paper , to do laundry after a long day			1
yet the motivation to get healthy often eludes us			1
it hides in the form of excuses -- excuses for why we ca n't go to the gym or cook a healthy meal , why we ca n't get enough sleep or make time for ourselves			2
often we lack motivation because we lack inspiration			2
