@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity3 has ordered two reviews of whether the military justice system is properly dispensing punishments and suitably protecting sexual assault victims , the @entity2 said tuesday			1
the reviews were prompted by outrage from members of @entity11 over a case involving an air force officer found guilty last year in military court of sexual assault who was later cleared of the charges by his top commander			1
the judge presiding over the court - martial at @entity22 in @entity23 of lt. col. @entity24 sentenced him to a year in prison and kicked him out of the service			1
air force lt. gen. @entity28 , @entity24 's top commander in @entity29 , was the convening authority for the court - martial and reviewed the final case and sentence			1
@entity28 overturned the decision , throwing out the charges and clearing @entity24 's military record			0
he was reinstated in the @entity37 earlier this year			0
@entity38 said @entity28 reviewed the case over a three - week period and used his authority under @entity41 of the @entity42			2
" he concluded that the entire body of evidence was insufficient to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt , " @entity38 said in a letter to sen. @entity44 , a @entity46 @entity45 who has been an outspoken critic of @entity28 's decision			0
" i believe this case does raise a significant question whether it is necessary or appropriate to place the convening authority in the position of having the responsibility to review the findings and sentence of a court - martial , " @entity38 added			1
@entity2 officials told @entity1 last week that is rare for charges to be dismissed in this manner			0
@entity65 law says the commander 's decision is final and can not be overturned by the service secretary or the secretary of defense , @entity38 told @entity44			1
but @entity38 said that he would review the legal authorization and ordered @entity37 secretary @entity72 and @entity2 acting general counsel @entity73 to review the case			1
@entity38 asked that the review " assess whether all aspects of the ( code of military justice ) were correctly applied and to make recommendations on how the convening authority 's decision in this case could be more transparent , " @entity2 spokesman @entity75 told reporters at a briefing			1
@entity75 said the report to @entity38 is due march 20			0
in a second and broader review , @entity38 ordered @entity73 to examine military law covering the actions of the convening authority and to see whether changes should be made			2
that assessment is due a week later			0
" eliminating sexual assault in the military is one of his top priorities , " @entity75 said about @entity38 's commitment to members of @entity11 and military leaders			2
" sexual assault is a serious crime that has no place in the department and he will not tolerate it , " @entity75 added			0
" any member of the military that is convicted of sexual assault -- no matter his rank or position -- must be held appropriately accountable			0
" separately , a bipartisan proposal in the @entity111 would strip military commanders of the unilateral power to overturn convictions or lessen sentences handed down by judges and juries at courts - martial			1
" it is time to right an egregious wrong in our military justice system			2
the fact that one person can overturn a punishment determined by a judge or jury flies in the face of justice			0
we need a military justice system for the 21st century			2
the one we have now is primitive and is reminiscent of a time when punishments were decided by an autocrat , not by a judge or jury , " said rep. @entity132 , a @entity46 @entity45			0
