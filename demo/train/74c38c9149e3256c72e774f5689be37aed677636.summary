-- here 's what @entity2 expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery : two titanium rods , a bone graft , 17 screws in her vertebrae , eight hours in the operating room , and a week 's stay in the hospital to recover			1
here 's what she did n't expect on top of all that : sharing a hospital room with a feverish 6 - year - old and contracting a nasty bacterial infection her mother says nearly killed her			1
" she got so weak she could n't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom -- i had to carry her , " says her mother , @entity23			0
" for about 48 hours , i did n't think we 'd have @entity2 with us much longer			1
" because of the infection she picked up at the hospital , @entity2 , who was 19 at the time , dropped from 120 to 90 pounds			1
the bacterium that made her so sick is called @entity32 , and according to a study out this week , it 's more common than ever among hospitalized children in the @entity35 , and children who get it are more likely to die or require surgery			1
the study found @entity40 difficile infections in hospitalized children went up 15 % per year from 1997 , when there were 3,565 infections , to 2006 , when there were 7,779 infections			2
the study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006 , of whom 21,274 , or 0.2 % , had @entity32 , as the bacteria are commonly called			1
the study was published this week in the @entity51			2
" this is huge , and really concerning , " says dr. @entity52 , director of the @entity54 research group at @entity55			0
what 's really disturbing , he says , is that these children did n't have to get sick			2
" most of these infections are preventable , " he added			0
@entity2 's story @entity2 was a healthy 19 - year - old avid soccer and volleyball player when she went into a @entity65 hospital in august 2008 for surgery to correct her scoliosis , or curvature of the spine			1
the surgery was successful , and she was discharged six days later doing well , except for a low - grade fever			0
a few days after she returned home to @entity73 , a suburb of @entity65 , @entity2 took a turn for the worse when the incisions on her back opened up and she began to feel weak			1
her mother called the doctor , and he told her to bring @entity2 back to the hospital			1
doctors found @entity2 had an infection -- not @entity32 , but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up			1
" when i woke up from that surgery i thought that was it , i was done , but they told me i 'd be having another surgery in 48 hours , " she remembers			0
" and then i had to have another one , and then another one			0
" @entity2 and her parents did n't know it , but her situation was the perfect storm for a c. diff infection			1
she was taking massive doses of intravenous antibiotics , which kill the good bacteria in the gut , and @entity32 thrives in the absence of good bacteria			1
" i was throwing up all the time , and was so weak that one day i just blacked out in my hospital bed , " she remembers			2
the antibiotic @entity103 cleared up the @entity32 , but by that time it had ravaged her intestines			1
" it took six months for me to eat normally again , " she remembers			0
" there 's no excuse " across the country in @entity111 , @entity108 of @entity109 has fixed its @entity32 problem			1
three years ago , the hospital had 5.3 @entity115 diff infections for every 1,000 hospital admissions , and in the past three years it 's had none at all , according to dr. @entity118 , epidemiologist for the hospital			2
" it 's frustrating , because some hospitals say there 's nothing they can do about their @entity115 diff rates , " he says			0
" but that 's no excuse			0
they could do a lot of things			0
" based on @entity108 's success , here are some things parents can do to protect their children from @entity32 when they 're in the hospital			1
for more information on preventing other types of hospital infections , see information from @entity140 and the @entity141 to reduce infection deaths			1
give your child yogurt at @entity147 , patients at high risk of @entity32 are given yogurt because it helps restore the good bacteria in the gut that in turn help fight off bad bacteria			1
if your hospital does n't offer yogurt , @entity118 suggests that you bring it in yourself and that one serving a day is enough to help protect your child			1
if a child ca n't eat , he can take probiotic supplements containing lactobacillus			0
for babies , breast milk helps protect against @entity115 diff infections			2
know the signs of @entity115 diff infection if your child has watery diarrhea , fever , abdominal pain , fast breathing , or is extremely sleepy , ask your doctor if it could be a c. diff infection			2
" it 's not any one symptom , but the whole picture that 's important , " @entity52 says			0
" if as a parent your gut tells you your child just is n't normal , there 's likely truth in that			0
" he adds that parents sometimes notice signs of infection before doctors or nurses			1
" parents are with their kids all the time , " he says			0
" and nurses are by the bedside for 12 hours			0
as the attending physician , i actually have the least amount of time with the patient			0
clean everything @entity32 spreads when someone touches the feces of an infected person , and then touches someone else , or touches a surface , such as a doorknob , that someone else will later touch			2
at @entity147 , officials credit much of their success against the bacteria to a thorough cleaning of every room , even making sure to change the mop head between rooms			0
@entity118 recommends bringing your own disinfectant wipes and cleaning commonly touched surfaces , such as bedrails			0
the @entity141 to reduce @entity212 has more information on how routine cleaning by hospital staff might not be enough to control @entity32			1
ask for a private room @entity23 says they 'll never know how @entity2 got sick , but they wonder if she got it from a feverish little girl who shared a room with @entity2 during both her first and second hospital stays			1
the @entity223 recommends that a patient with @entity32 have his or her own room			2
if you 're concerned your child 's roommate is ill -- or that your child is ill -- you can ask to be separated			0
make sure hospital staff wears glove , gowns after @entity2 was moved into her own room , her parents were told to wear gowns to cover their clothing and prevent the spread of their daughter 's infection to themselves and others			1
they noticed , however , that doctors and nurses did not wear gowns when visiting their daughter			2
" there should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff , " @entity52 says			0
" if there is a difference , it 's likely the staff is being noncompliant			0
" if you see doctors and nurses are n't gowning up or washing their hands , tell them , @entity52 advises			2
" as a parent i know we worry we 're going to piss off the doctor if we ask too many questions , " he says			0
" but the reality is it 's your child 's life on the line , so it 's worth taking a risk			0
