the law passed at the height of @entity3 's civil rights movement , when citizens in parts of the country were fighting each other and sometimes authorities over how skin color impacts a person 's place in a democracy			1
now , its present and future are in doubt after the @entity18 's 5 - 4 decision tuesday that key parts of the @entity20 are no longer valid			1
the prevailing opinion leaves it to a divided @entity23 to revise the law , so that it 's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices			1
the main reason for the ruling , chief justice @entity31 explained , was that " our country has changed " for the better			1
deplorable conditions that spurred @entity23 five decades ago to require certain parts of the @entity3 to " preclear " changes to voting laws " no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions			1
" the formula that @entity23 enacted as recently as 2006 , to determine which areas are covered by the act , has " no logical relation to the present day , " @entity31 wrote in the majority opinion			1
" while any racial discrimination in voting is too much , @entity23 must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy the problem speaks to the current conditions , " he said			2
read the ruling officials hailed the decision in places such as @entity54 and @entity55 , @entity56 , which raised the case when it sued the federal government			2
but president @entity59 did not , nor did civil rights leaders			2
@entity61 is one of them			1
born to sharecroppers in @entity56 in 1940 , he became a leader in the civil rights movement , working with the rev. @entity66 and others			2
in march 1965 , he led hundreds protesting voting rights in @entity56 when they were confronted by @entity56 authorities after crossing the @entity71 in @entity54 -- an incident that became known as " @entity73			1
" long a @entity3 representative from @entity75 , @entity61 said what happened then is relevant now , and he claimed " numerous attempts to impede voting rights " nationwide still need to be addressed			1
to him , the high court decision -- which he said " stuck a dagger into the heart of the @entity20 " -- is personal			1
" these men never stood in unmovable lines , " said @entity61 of the justices , referring to voter registration ques that never moved			1
" they were never denied the right to participate in the democratic process			2
they were never beaten , jailed , run off their farms or fired from their jobs			0
" no one they knew died simply trying to register to vote			0
they are not the victims of gerrymandering or contemporary unjust schemes to maneuver them out of their constitutional rights			0
" what the ruling says tuesday 's ruling does n't change the fact it 's still illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting			0
but it does change how some governments have been singled out			0
unlike the rest of the nation , these municipalities , counties and states have had to get the federal government 's approval first before they made any changes to their voting laws and regulations			0
civil rights groups say the @entity20 -- specifically @entity120 , the mechanism for the special treatment for some locales -- has been an important tool in protecting minority voters from governments with a history of setting unfair barriers to the polls			1
@entity61 recalled some tuesday , such as devious " literacy tests " or asking people to figure " the number of jelly beans in a jar			1
" " my own father , my own mother , my grandparents could not register to vote simply because of the color of their skin , " he told @entity135			0
in her dissenting opinion , justice @entity141 pointed out that @entity23 passed the latest installment of the @entity20 with " overwhelming bipartisan support , " saying the representatives legitimately exercised their constitutional powers in doing so			1
" the sad irony of today 's decision lies in ( the court 's ) utter failure to grasp why the ( law ) has proven effective , " @entity141 wrote			1
opinion : how segregation got busted but her view did n't rule the day			0
instead , the ruling decision overturned critical aspects of the law			2
specifically , section 4 -- the formula the federal government uses to determine which states and counties are subject to continued oversight -- was struck down			0
@entity31 said that formula , which was devised in 1972 and later reauthorized by @entity23 , is outdated and unworkable			1
that means @entity120 effectively can not be enforced			0
it relies heavily on the coverage formula to determine which governments must still run any changes by the @entity170			0
in his ruling opinion , @entity31 faulted @entity23 for not updating " the coverage formula " last decade to reflect changing times			1
" its failure leaves us today with no choice but to declare @entity159 unconstitutional , " he wrote			2
" the formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance			0
" as @entity31 noted , this does n't make discrimination against voters legal , all of a sudden			1
but it does lift a key barrier to authorities in some states to make changes independently			2
@entity192 attorney general @entity191 , for one , announced tuesday that after the decision " the state 's voter id law will take effect immediately ( and ) redistricting maps passed by the @entity198 may also take effect without approval from the federal government			1
" " that basically gives a green light to these nine @entity206 states and a handful of other jurisdictions to change the law any way they want and basically say to the @entity170 , ' catch me if you can , ' " explained @entity135 senior legal analyst @entity202			2
" it looks like these @entity206 states are going to start making changes			0
and we 'll see how that 's going to affect the right to vote in the relatively near future			0
" should every state , county be treated the same ? the @entity59 administration points out some governments have gotten out of @entity120 under the now old rules			1
for example , 31 cities and counties and @entity227 successfully petitioned to be exempt from the preclearance requirements in recent years , though the rest of the state remains under federal oversight			2
the law had been working in preventing " discriminatory voting changes , " attorney general @entity233 said			1
specifically , he mentioned how it blocked @entity192 from adopting a new congressional redistricting map that would have " discriminated against @entity239 voters			1
" @entity233 also said the @entity20 changed how @entity240 will implement a law requiring photo identification before being allowed to vote			1
those changes , he said , protected black voters who would have been " disproportionately " affected			0
@entity59 characterized tuesday 's ruling as a " setback , " even as he vowed his " administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process			0
" voting discrimination , he said , still exists , and the decision " upsets decades of well - established practices that help make sure voting is fair			0
" others offered even stronger language			0
sen. @entity257 of @entity258 called tuesday 's decision a " devastating blow for civil rights and voting rights ; " @entity258 gov. @entity263 described it as " deeply troubling ; " and @entity266 president @entity265 called the decision " outrageous , " because it makes minority voters " more vulnerable to the flood of attacks we have seen in recent years			0
" rep. @entity276 , chairwoman of the @entity277 -- in a statement that included remarks from the heads of @entity239 and @entity275 groups in @entity23 -- slammed the high court for its choice " to ignore " reports that " racial discrimination in voting districts continues to exist			1
" but the sentiments were markedly different in @entity56 , where gov. @entity283 said the decision " reflects how conditions have improved			0
" " the justices correctly acknowledged that the covered jurisdictions should no longer be punished by the federal government for conditions that existed over 40 years ago , " said @entity286 , the county attorney for @entity55 , where 11 % of residents are african - american compared to 28 % statewide			2
" @entity293 is an altogether different place than it was in 1965			2
" @entity294 , a conservative and director of the @entity296 , said tuesday he 's happy that no government is now singled out			0
" this decision restores an important constitutional order to our system of government , " he said			0
" and that requires that all 50 states and every jurisdiction have the laws applied equally to them			0
" veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost			0
