does 2013 actually deserve that title ? among video - game enthusiasts , the year was nearly consumed by the official announcement , subsequent speculation about , and ultimate release of @entity8 's @entity7 and @entity11 's @entity10 home consoles			1
controversy and questions from gamers followed each long - awaited console until their arrival in homes began in november			0
both clearly sparked lots of interest			0
@entity8 is reporting 2.1 million in global @entity7 sales , while @entity11 says it 's sold more than 2 million @entity21			1
both are poised to hit large , but slightly different audiences			1
@entity8 is going after the hardcore , dedicated gamer while @entity11 is positioning their device as an entertainment hub for the whole family			0
either way , both are expected to do very well and create a huge demand for games and other content well into 2014			0
@entity34 , who led the next - generation charge in 2012 with the @entity37 , spent much of the year concentrating on developing games for their new console			0
battling a soft reception for the @entity37 , the company released a wide range of games for hardcore players as well as casual , family - friendly titles , including a return of the always - popular @entity47 in the new " @entity48			0
" their handheld console , the @entity49 , continued to be a boon for the company			2
it 's regularly the company 's best - selling platform , and the release of " @entity54 " for the device ushered in a new chapter in the long - running franchise			2
they also added to their handheld stable with the @entity60 , a portable console designed for children			0
more durable and without the 3d effect , the @entity60 was developed for the rough - and - tumble life of a kid			0
they were n't the only ones with a new entry in the portable market			0
the @entity69 , released in july , tries bridge pc gaming and portable gaming			2
it can be used as a pc game controller , uses an @entity75 - based mobile platform and has access to the @entity77 as well as @entity69 's own @entity78			2
technology advancements are creating more detailed , more responsive , and better quality games for the mobile gaming audience			1
a new @entity83 64 - bit processing chip released in september had developers saying phone games are getting closer to console quality			1
and analysts are bullish on the future of mobile gaming , predicting revenues to reach $ 13.2 billion by the end of 2013 and nearly double in the next two year			1
established pc and console game makers ( @entity95 and @entity96 to name just two ) pushed into the mobile market aggressively in 2013 , making games for the casual as well as the dedicated gamer			1
mobile games were n't the only winners in 2013			1
the massive release of @entity104 helped propel consumer spending on gaming to $ 3.45 billion in the third quarter of the year , the best quarter since 2011 , according to the @entity108			1
however , it was n't all peaches and cream for the gaming industry in 2013			1
despite a flood of money to some titles , some big - name game companies found themselves on the outside			0
@entity118 , a company that created the very popular " @entity120 " series and held the @entity122 license , finally broke apart in february with many of its properties being bought up by other companies			0
@entity126 , a major powerhouse in social platform gaming , began shutting down some games , laying off personnel , closing offices and reported losing nearly half its user base from the previous year			1
despite the hiring of former @entity11 executive @entity135 as @entity126 's new ceo , many top executives also left the company			1
the landscape of gaming is definitely in flux			2
the development of new technology is expanding the reach of quality games to more players			0
female gamers and parents playing with their kids are growing in numbers and game makers are working on games to reflect that more diverse audience			0
and with the expansion of the audience comes greater acceptance of the gaming experience in our culture			2
so if you think 2013 was the @entity1 , just wait until 2014 .			2
