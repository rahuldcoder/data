the videos of the executions have pointed to @entity48 airstrikes against @entity4 forces in @entity43 as the motivation			2

" @entity1 's wife said her husband , a father of two , was only trying to do good in @entity8			1
" @entity1 is a peaceful , selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the @entity3 to drive in a convoy all the way to @entity8 with his @entity69 colleagues and friends to help those most in need , " she said in the statement			1
she expressed concern that his captors were n't answering her calls for his release			2

" whatever your grievance with @entity48 or @entity3 foreign policy , executing this man is not the answer , " said @entity114 , a judge on the @entity115 in @entity116			0
" we ask you to adhere to the @entity125 ruling on this matter and release him immediately and unconditionally			0
" the only non-muslim @entity1 was making his fourth trip to @entity8 with an aid convoy when he was abducted			1
while part of the convoy stopped at the @entity133 border , @entity1 -- the only non-muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into @entity8 with a 10 - person advance party			1
in video shot on that day , he explained part of his rationale for answering the call to help			0
" it 's all worthwhile when you see what is needed actually gets where it needs to go , " he said , before hugging a colleague			0

dr. @entity147 , a volunteer doctor who stayed behind the main part of the convoy at the @entity133 border , said they got a phone call saying @entity1 had been taken by masked gunmen			2
" this was something that we thought was just a temporary measure , with him being a non-muslim and being visibly @entity22 , " she told @entity158			0
the other members of the convoy thought " that they would just question him further and then they would let him go , " she said			0
but amid clashes between @entity4 and rival rebel factions in the area , that did n't happen			2
' he is not to blame ' now , @entity113 - @entity167 says she has a message for the people holding @entity1			1
" as your sister in @entity113 , i would implore you and beg of you : please spare the life of this innocent man , " she said			0

in @entity1 's hard - scrabble hometown of @entity207 in northern @entity22 , well - wishers have tied yellow ribbons to lampposts and street signs			1
