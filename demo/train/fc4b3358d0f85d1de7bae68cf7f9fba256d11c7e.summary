-- @entity2 's petite frame should fool nobody -- she 's a weightlifting warrior			1
if the 19 - year - old is n't employing her immense physical strength to lift more than 120 kilograms -- easily double her own weight -- she 's smiting @entity9 trolls who are foolish enough to take her on			1
" i suppose there is the stereotype that women who lift weights are butch , " she told @entity0 's human to @entity13 about the online attacks she has faced			1
" or my favorite one is lesbians , which is a ridiculous kind of thing to say because i do n't understand how lifting weights could make you a lesbian			1
but anyway , it 's not me who thinks these things			2
" @entity2 may stand at just five foot three inches tall but tenacity courses through her veins , evident by a debut performance at the @entity33 that cemented her status as @entity36 's preeminent weightlifter			1
she equated the noise that greeted her @entity39 record lift of 121 kg in the 58 kg category to the tumult that was lavished upon one of her favorite bands , @entity43 , at one of their @entity47 gigs			1
and though that cacophony saluted her strength , mental fortitude has been just as valuable in her battle to convince people that lifting weights was her destiny -- even her mum and dad			2
" at first everybody was like ' what are you doing ? ' when i told them i had started weightlifting , even my parents actually , " she said			2
" it was n't the fact that they thought it was like a ' boy 's sport , ' it was the fact they were paying for me to do gymnastics and i was spending all my time in the weights gym ! so they were n't best pleased			2
but then i think my dad came in first and saw me lifting			0
" i think i was only doing high pulls , so from the floor to about ( shoulder height ) on about 60 kilos and just being curious about it i think my dad picked it up when no - one was looking and his face went white as a sheet			2
" he was n't quite himself the whole way home and i overheard him say to my @entity89 , ' i 've just seen what she 's lifting ! ' " if her dad was shocked then , he 'll surely be flabbergasted by now			0
@entity2 has gone to conquer a multitude of @entity39 records since taking up the sport , in her two chosen disciplines : the snatch and the clean and jerk			1
in 2010 , at 16 , she became the first @entity98 to win a medal at the @entity100 , taking home the bronze , and added silver at the @entity104 the following year before hitting the big stage at @entity33			1
her experience in @entity107 for the @entity108 gives an indication of the dedication her sport requires			0
" i think i had , in the past couple of days prior to that , just an egg and a glass of water -- this is the extreme measures we have to go to in order to cut weight for our category , " she said			0
" it was boiling hot and i felt i was going to die			0
but had i been on form i probably could have won			0
@entity125 was n't bad , i 'm hoping to go back next year ( in @entity126 , @entity127 ) and get the gold			2
" @entity2 had always set her heart on appearing in the @entity33 , but by the time she was 12 , she 'd grown to realize it would n't be in the field of gymnastics -- her first love			1
her coach planted a seed that she might have a far better chance of making it to the @entity33 if she swapped the high bars for the dumbbells			1
and despite the switch perplexing her family and friends at first , the idea stuck			0
" i was powerful but not very graceful so i would never have made it as a gymnast , " @entity2 said			1
" i was always good at tumbling and stuff but i could never get to grips with beam bars -- i was terrified of stuff like that			0
" they needed a girl for the weightlifting club to take part in a competition to make up a full team so i gave it a go and i took to it quite quickly			0
" junior @entity39 records had been tumbling throughout her teens but it was the limelight of @entity33 that thrust her into the public consciousness			1
though not yet 20 , @entity2 radiates the twin characteristics that delight @entity39 sports fans --- a mixture of bulldog and underdog			1
@entity170 , driven , plucky and resilient , her makeup formed a potent cocktail that legions of followers in in the @entity39 found irresistible			1
but as is often the case with high - profile sporting stars , her achievements at the @entity100 drew sniping in some quarters on social media sites			1
if they had n't realized while watching her delight the partisan home crowd , the trolls soon found out that @entity2 is not one to take a backwards step			1
" doing a sport like this i think you 're going to get a bit of stick but i 'm quite good at handling that kind of thing , " she said			0
" i 'm really competitive and i like to win arguments			0
i never let things slide so i just have to take them up on it and say ' well , why am i a lesbian ? why am i butch ? ' all this kind of stuff			2
" they never have a real answer for it so until someone proves that it 's going to change me or the way i am , i am going to keep doing it			0
" respected and admired for her display at the @entity100 , finishing 12th in the overall competition , she was also lauded for the head - on way she tackled her detractors			1
and her profile was such that many people have been in touch to ask how they can get into the sport			0
so how does she look back on the experience of competing in her hometown @entity33 ? " it was crazy , " she said			1
" i still ca n't really put into words how i feel about it			0
again i think i was really nervous , i did n't have the best competition			0
" i got the @entity39 record in clean and jerk which was good			1
and i just really enjoyed competing in front of a home crowd			2
" it was terrifying and nerve - racking ; i think i experienced every emotion available to mankind			2
it was a once in a lifetime experience and i would do it all again if i could			0
" that is a distinct possibility if her progress continues to climb			0
and @entity2 says she 'll be better prepared to deal with the size of the occasion when thrust into the cauldron of @entity233 competition again			1
" in the future i think i 'm going to have to use that as a learning curve , " she adds			0
" take what i did wrong from that experience , maybe be better prepared , and do n't put myself through hell a couple of days before			0
" i 've got the experience of competing on a major stage under my belt now ; i ca n't really use nerves as an excuse anymore			2
" i 've been there and done it , it 's not going to be such a fear of the unknown			0
it 'll be , ' i 've been here before , i know what i 'm doing , i know what to do			0

@entity39 weightlifter @entity2 *fulfilled* a dream by competing in @entity33

she has fought stereotypes of weightlifters who are called " butch " or " lesbians "
@entity2 says the noise that greeted her display in @entity268 was similar to a rock *concert*
