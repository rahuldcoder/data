-- @entity1 : the president said @entity3 is a national security priority			1
how are you responding to that ? @entity6 : well , it is a national security priority			2
i 'd be happy to explain why			2
but let me speak to how we 're responding to it			2
we 're responding to -- i actually held a roundtable months ago because i -- a very bright staff officer on the @entity12 staff came to me and said this is different			2
it 's different because it 's urbanized , it 's different because it 's a third strain of the disease			1
it 's different before of the fragility of the infrastructure , of the governments in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
and so we brought in a panel of experts and we started talking about how this could evolve			2
and we did some parallel planning			2
that 's what we do , right , we plan			1
so @entity36 , general @entity35 began planning for what we could do to empower and enable civil authority			2
you know , this is not a mil -- it 's not a military threat			1
but the military has some pretty unique capabilities to deal with all kinds of issues			1
we can provide command and control , that is to say , a central location with communications and computers and bandwidth that can help people see the situation			2
we 've got the finest logistics infrastructure in the world			2
so we 've got a command and control headquarters in @entity59			2
we 've got an -- an intermediate logistics staging base in -- in @entity61 , @entity62			2
we 're building a training center in @entity59			1
now , you might say , why are you building a training center ? that 's another thing we do very well , we run good boot camps			1
so we 're going to run a boot camp for health care workers coming from all over the world , using the @entity72 program of instruction , to give those health care workers confidence that they know what they 're up against and how to follow the proper medical protocols when they 're in the hot zone			1
we actually are not going to play soldiers , sailors , airmen , marines , coast guardsmen in contact with patients , but we 're putting an architecture around them that will allow the health care workers to do what they 've got to do			2
related : get up to speed on the @entity3 outbreak @entity91 : so how are you going to protect the @entity94 military troops that are there and prevent them from bringing this home ? @entity6 : yes , that 's a great question			1
and we 're going to -- first of all , we 're not going to wait until they 're there			2
so we also know how to train			0
and so we 've got a -- we 've got a system of training events prior to deployment , during deployment and during deployment , we tier them in terms of the -- the risk that they may be in contact with somebody with @entity3			1
so the logistician sitting in @entity62 is highly unlikely to be in contact with anyone from -- from @entity26 , @entity27 or @entity25			0
so they 're in a lower risk category			0
and we manage them differently			0
those in a high risk category , we manage them better			0
when they get ready to come back , there will be a period of observation before they come back			0
and then when they come back , there will be a 20 wait -- a 21 day period of observation when they 're back here			0
now , here 's what sets us apart			1
most everybody else self - monitors , right ? there 's nothing self - monitor about the way the military treats our soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines , coast guards			1
we 'll be -- we have a chain of command			0
there are some staff sergeants , some 32 - year - old mean as a snake staff sergeant who every day is going to look his soldiers -- i 'll use soldiers , but it 's the other services , too -- in the eye and make sure that they 're not in any way exhibiting symptoms related to @entity3			1
and so we will use the chain of command to monitor , supervise monitoring from the time they leave until the time they come back and beyond when they come back to make sure we 're giving our -- our -- our young men and women the best possible chance to protect themselves and also avoid the -- to avoid but not eliminate entirely the possibility that they would bring something back			0
related : @entity94 troops assisting in @entity3 response may be quarantined @entity91 : big picture , i 'm just going to throw it out there			1
@entity6 : yes ? @entity91 : with this @entity3 situation and -- and all the major gaps in the system that we 've seen , even the @entity178 director said that the agency should have taken control of that @entity186 hospital , what does that tell you about the @entity94 ' -- the @entity94 ' capability to respond to a bioterror attack ? @entity6 : well , we -- this wo n't surprise you , that we , through @entity195 , @entity195 , we have a command in the continental @entity94 , it sits in @entity197 , @entity198			1
its mission is to support the home -- well , it has a defensive mission to the homeland related to long - range aviation , to missiles and rockets and -- but it also has a very important mission to provide direct support to civil authority			0
and we have a contingency plan for managing pandemics , that is , things that would begin to exceed the capability of a particular community or a state even to deal with it			1
and we update it periodically			0
and this is one of those cases where we 're -- we 're dusting it off			0
we 're very closely in contact with all -- @entity220 , the @entity221 , the @entity178 , the @entity222 for the stuff going on overseas			0
we are in the planning business and we 're deeply into it with regard to this			0
but it 's very much a mission assigned to civil authority			1
@entity91 : so what do you say to all the @entity94 that are looking at this @entity3 situation and are in absolute panic ? @entity6 : well , i say a couple of things			1
one , the -- @entity3 is a , to use a sports metaphor , this needs to be an away game			1
and that 's why the @entity94 military is involved			1
we want to keep this -- we want to help international health organizations , service organizations and non-governmental organizations			1
we want to help them keep this in isolation inside of those three countries			0
but there is a risk that if we -- if we , collectively , the international community , failed to keep it isolated , that -- that it could become actually -- you 've heard all the experts			1
i do n't need to compete with them for , you know , to sound like i slept at a @entity261 last night			0
but i have studied this thing			0
and there is a risk that it -- that the -- the rate of reproduction , the -- the ability of one patient to affect first two and then four and then eight and then it becomes exponential			0
so we 've -- we 've really got to be aggressive about the isolation and treatment matters that we 're taking up			0
inside the homeland , again , we 're in support of those			0
but i can promise you that the @entity94 military will do its part , with civil authorities , to keep this thing from coming to our homeland			0
and then inside of the @entity94 , we 've got to count on the civil organizations that are responsible for health care			0
@entity91 : are you , @entity282 , worried about @entity3 here in the @entity94 ? @entity6 : i 've been worried about @entity3 globally for about 90 days			1
and i have had some on my staff that were probably a little more worried than i was even a few weeks or months before that			0
@entity91 : why ? @entity6 : i 'm worried about it because it -- because we know so little about it			0
you know , you 'll hear different people describe whether it could become airborne			0
i mean if you bring two , you know , two , uh , doctors who happen to have that specialty into a room , one will say , no , there 's no way it will ever become airborne , but it could mutate so it would be harder to discover			1
it actually disguises itself in the body , which is what makes it so dangerous and has that incubation period of about 21 days			0
another doctor will say , well , if it continues to mutate at the rate it 's mutating and if we go from 20,000 infected to 100,000 , the population might allow it the opportunity to mutate and become airborne			1
and then it will be an extraordinarily serious problem			0
i do n't know who 's right			1
i do n't want to take chance , so i 'm taking it very seriously .			0

the @entity320 is updating it 's plan for an *emergency* pandemic
the @entity320 is creating a training center and " boot camp " for international @entity3 responders
it is *preferable* to deal with @entity3 as an " away game , " according to @entity282
