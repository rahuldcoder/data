-- there was barely time for the pea to stop spinning as the final whistle blew on the @entity4 season before club owners started the next phase of their insatiable quest for improved fortunes			0
@entity9 took less than 24 hours to dispense with the services of @entity12 coach @entity11 , while @entity13 managed to wait just a little longer before sacking @entity14			1
the dismissals take the number of @entity4 managers sacked in the course of the 2013 - 2014 season to 12 , with @entity21 manager @entity20 also in danger of losing his job			2
tuesday was also the day when many expected @entity25 to give a concrete update on his chances of joining @entity28 , but the man who will step down as @entity31 coach after the forthcoming @entity32 was non-committal			0
" i 'm here as @entity39 national team coach , not the future @entity28 coach , " @entity33 told reporters at the training camp in @entity36 , before refusing to be drawn further on the subject			0
the @entity39 has been widely tipped to take charge at @entity42 , after a tumultuous season in which @entity44 finished as interim manager following the dismissal of @entity47			2
even though @entity14 left @entity48 with the best win percentage ( 59 % ) of any @entity13 manager in the @entity4 , he paid the price for failing to keep his emotions in check and to take @entity13 into the @entity54			1
@entity55 was manager for the first half of the season so @entity14 can not take all the blame yet he did finish the season 10 points off the @entity54 places , having taken charge when the gap was half that tally			1
" we appointed @entity14 mid-season as someone who knew both the players and the club , " said @entity13 owner @entity64 in a statement			1
" we agreed an 18 - month contract with a break clause at the end of the season and we have now exercised that option			0
" overseeing sunday 's 3 - 0 defeat of @entity77 , which enabled @entity13 to finish sixth , @entity14 did at least ensure a fourth consecutive season of @entity80 football , worth around $ 14 million to the club			1
that falls short of the @entity54 football that owner @entity64 so desperately wants to see , both for its prestige and riches			0
in addition to the $ 42 million guaranteed by television money , clubs can also profit by squeezing every last ounce out of their commercial partners given the greater exposure afforded by being part of @entity96 football 's greatest club competition			0
@entity99 manager @entity98 is favorite to replace @entity14 and if the @entity100 can lift the @entity99 to eighth , can he be the man to take @entity13 back to the @entity54 for the first time since 2010/11 ? such a return would be particularly welcome , especially with the new television deal guaranteeing @entity105 clubs at least $ 67 million when it comes into play for the 2015/16 season			1
while such sums seem suitably seductive , they are not far off the amount that clubs earn just by staying in the @entity4			0
take @entity9 's neighbors and rivals @entity113 , who were pulling in the @entity4 pay packed until their relegation in 2012			2
during the 2011 - 12 season , the club made a profit of $ 9.7 million but one year later , they had lost $ 50 million -- a figure that would have been worse had it not been for the first parachute payment ( $ 27m of $ 81m ) that clubs receive after relegation from the @entity4			0
it 's a reminder to @entity9 , who finished the season just one place above the relegation zone , of the importance of getting their next appointment right , following a season in which both @entity11 and predecessor @entity131 were pushed out .			1

@entity13 dismiss manager @entity14
@entity99 coach @entity98 is favorite to take charge of @entity13
@entity137 dismissal comes shortly after @entity9 part ways with @entity11
