president @entity0 on wednesday outlined a foreign policy vision of " might doing right , " arguing that modern pragmatism requires both a strong military and the diplomatic tools of alliances and sanctions to exert influence and provide global leadership			1
he told graduating cadets at the @entity10 at @entity10 that after the nation 's " long season of war and divisions about how to move forward , " they now would represent @entity15 with the duty " not only to protect our country , but to do what is right and just			2
" under fire from the political right for what critics call diminishing @entity15 global influence , @entity0 offered a robust defense of his foreign policy as the pragmatic and most effective expression of @entity15 's leadership role in the world			1
" i believe in @entity15 exceptionalism with every fiber of my being , " he said , referring to a tenet of conservative ideology			0
" but what makes us exceptional is not flouting international norms and the rule of law ; it 's our willingness to affirm them through our actions , " @entity0 said in arguing that true leadership involves not only having the world 's most powerful military , but in doing the right thing			1
" @entity15 must always lead on the world stage , " @entity0 said , and the military " always will be the backbone of that leadership , " but @entity15 military action " can not be the only -- or even primary -- component of our leadership in every instance			1
" in a direct jab at his detractors , the president said those " who suggest that @entity15 is in decline , or has seen its global leadership slip away , are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics			1
" one of the most strident critics , @entity62 sen. @entity62 of @entity63 , responded wednesday by telling @entity64 that @entity15 remained mighty but @entity0 has failed to follow through on threats such as his " red line " for @entity15 military strikes if the @entity69 government used chemical weapons			1
" we are unreliable , and all our allies and our enemies believe that , " said @entity62 , who lost to @entity0 in the 2008 presidential election			1
to @entity77 , the former @entity78 leader who served as @entity0 's @entity80 peace envoy , the president " made a persuasive case to the reality that we can not intervene militarily everywhere			1
" however , @entity77 said the @entity15 should have done more to help the @entity69 opposition without sending @entity15 troops			0
read the president 's speech in a sign of the sentiments of the cadets and those attending their commencement ceremony , @entity0 got big applause when he noted they were the first @entity10 graduates in more than a decade unlikely to be stationed in a war zone			2
since he took office , @entity0 noted , @entity15 had ended the @entity96 war and was preparing to end the @entity98 conflict , decimated @entity100 's leadership in the border region between @entity102 and @entity98 , and eliminated @entity103			1
now it was time to shift foreign policy to combat a continuing terrorist threat that " no longer comes from a centralized @entity100 leadership , " but from " decentralized @entity100 affiliates and extremists , with agendas focused in the countries where they operate			0
" " this lessens the possibility of large - scale 9/11 - style attacks against the homeland , but heightens the danger of @entity15 personnel overseas being attacked , as we saw in @entity124 , " @entity0 said in reference to the 2012 assault that killed four @entity15 at a @entity15 compound in @entity116			2
" it heightens the danger to less defensible targets , as we saw in a shopping mall in @entity131 , " he said of the attack last year in @entity126			0
" so we have to develop a strategy that matches this diffuse threat ; one that expands our reach without sending forces that stretch our military thin , or stir up local resentments			0
" @entity0 also spoke of his personal burden as a wartime leader , saying he was " haunted " by the dead and wounded among troops he ordered to @entity98			0
" i would betray my duty to you , and to the country we love , if i sent you into harm 's way simply because i saw a problem somewhere in the world that needed to be fixed , or because i was worried about critics who think military intervention is the only way for @entity15 to avoid looking weak , " he told the graduating cadets			1
returning to a theme he 's visited throughout his presidency , @entity0 said he would continue to push for closing the terrorist detention facility at @entity157 " because @entity15 values and legal traditions do n't permit the indefinite detention of people beyond our borders			1
" overall , @entity0 said , " @entity15 has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world , " and he contended that " those who argue otherwise -- who suggest that @entity15 is in decline , or has seen its global leadership slip away -- are either misreading history or engaged in partisan politics			1
" " the question we face -- the question each of you will face -- is not whether @entity15 will lead , but how we will lead , not just to secure our peace and prosperity , but also extend peace and prosperity around the globe , " @entity0 told the cadets			2
the president 's speech came a day after he spelled out a plan that would leave nearly 10,000 troops in @entity98 at year 's end but essentially end the broader @entity15 military commitment there by the end of 2016			1
" we can not only responsibly end our war in @entity98 and achieve the objectives that took us to war in the first place , we 'll also be able to begin a new chapter in the story of @entity15 leadership around the world , " @entity0 said in the @entity188 on tuesday			1
@entity98 president @entity197 welcomed @entity0 's announcement of planned troop levels , saying in a statement posted wednesday on his official website that his government was " grateful to the international community for its assistance and remains confident " in the ability of the expanded and @entity207 - trained @entity98 forces to protect the country and its people			2
5 foreign policy headaches for @entity0 although @entity0 enjoyed high - profile foreign - policy successes at the beginning of his time in office , including the military mission to find and kill @entity103 , he 's come under harsh criticism recently for what opponents say is a passive approach abroad			1
they cite his record in @entity69 , where he backed away from airstrikes after president @entity224 's regime was reported to have used chemical weapons on citizens			0
@entity227 balked at approving the military force , leaving @entity0 to instead negotiate a deal that would remove the chemical stockpiles from @entity224 's control but keep @entity224 himself in power amid an ongoing civil war			2
while the administration has provided non-lethal aid to the @entity69 opposition , it has stopped short of supplying weapons and ammunition called for by @entity62 and other critics			2
in his speech , @entity0 said there was no military solution to the @entity69 civil war , and added that he will " work with @entity227 to ramp up support for those in the @entity69 opposition who offer the best alternative to terrorists and a brutal dictator			2
" national security adviser @entity251 told @entity64 that sending weapons and ammunition to @entity69 opposition groups would need " the authority and blessing of @entity227			0
" earlier , secretary of state @entity257 defended @entity15 policy for @entity69 , including the deal struck to get chemical weapons out of the country			0
speaking to @entity64 's " @entity262 , " he said he found it difficult to believe that critics would have preferred a military strike and hurting the @entity224 regime temporarily			0
he said that 92 % of @entity69 's chemical weapons have been removed , and the other 8 % are under control , waiting to be removed			0
" it 's remarkable to me that people simply want to refuse to accept that we 're better off getting all of the weapons out than striking for one or two days and doing damage to some of them , " @entity257 said			0
@entity62 argued that the result of the administration 's response meant that @entity69 president @entity224 consolidated his grip on power , @entity282 fighters and @entity284 's @entity283 were helping him out , @entity285 was increasing support for his regime and the war has become " a regional conflict and a tragedy of monumental proportions for which we will pay a heavy price in years to come			2
" critics of @entity0 's foreign policy also have said the president 's clear assertion that military force is off the table in @entity300 sends the wrong message to other countries -- namely @entity303 -- that have their own territorial disputes with neighbor states			1
the @entity15 and its allies have imposed economic sanctions on @entity285 for its incursion into @entity300 , though that step has n't done much to quiet the arguments coming from @entity0 's detractors			1
on wednesday , @entity0 reiterated his policy that the @entity15 will used military force , " unilaterally if necessary , " when its people are threatened , its livelihood is at stake or allies are in danger , but he said the threshold was higher when global issues " do not pose a direct threat " to the nation			1
" in such circumstances , we should not go it alone , " he said			0
" instead , we must mobilize allies and partners to take collective action			0
we have to broaden our tools to include diplomacy and development ; sanctions , isolation ; appeals to international law and -- if just , necessary , and effective -- multilateral military action			0
" such a collective approach " is more likely to succeed , more likely to be sustained , and less likely to lead to costly mistakes , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 last spoke broadly about his foreign policy during a trip to @entity340 in april , defending himself against those who say his policy lacks a discernible direction			0
" you hit singles ; you hit doubles ; every once in a while we may be able to hit a home run , " @entity0 said in @entity343 , lashing out at those who argue for greater use of military force in conflicts abroad			0
" why is it that everyone is so eager to use military force ? " he asked then			0
" after we have just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and our budget			0
and what is it exactly that these critics would have accomplished ? " according to aides , @entity0 's @entity10 speech kicks off a broader foreign policy push that will carry into his upcoming trip to @entity365 that includes a @entity367 summit in @entity368 and a visit to @entity370 , designed to reassure @entity372 allies after @entity285 's intervention in @entity300 .			1
