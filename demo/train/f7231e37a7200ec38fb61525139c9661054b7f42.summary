@entity0 -- radiation from airport body scanners penetrates organs beneath the skin but at low doses that meet national standards , according to a study by @entity10 's @entity9			1
but the study 's author , professor @entity11 , said the research does not answer the biggest question on travelers ' minds : are scanners safe ? she said more independent research is needed			1
the @entity10 study subjected government and vendor data to sophisticated computer modeling to estimate the radiation doses travelers receive when they are scanned by backscatter machines , one of two types of imagers used to detect weapons at security checkpoints			1
the @entity31 has maintained that the machines are safe , exposing travelers to about the same radiation they receive by flying about two minutes at cruising altitude			1
a passenger would have to receive more than 17,000 screenings in a year -- about 47 screenings a day , 365 days a year -- to exceed government standards , the @entity31 says			2
the @entity10 study says that the backscatter dose is " comparable " to one minute of exposure to cosmic radiation and considerably lower than radiation levels of other x-ray procedures , such as a mammogram			1
but it balks at calling the exposures safe , saying cosmic and backscatter radiation are different and that both the risks and benefits of backscatter need to be quantified			1
experts : body scanning ' woefully inadequate ' abroad @entity54 , a @entity55 , professor of biochemistry and biophysics , is against the @entity31 's use of backscatter technology			1
he criticized the @entity10 report , saying it was based on @entity31 data instead of independent testing of machines			1
" it 's a valid criticism , " responded @entity11			0
" i think that 's valid , and we put that criticism ( in the paper )			0
but that 's how research is			0
it 's not the whole enchilada			0
it 's one step ; not the whole step			0
" " i think it 's very important to have independent studies , " she said			2
@entity11 said that she goes through backscatter x-ray machines , but " i do n't feel comfortable putting my kids through them			2
" " that 's because in the medical imaging community , it 's always stressed that the ( radiation ) dosage should be as low as possible			2
and in this case , the lowest possible is not going through them			0
there 's an alternative technology out there , " she said			0
two options are millimeter wave machines , which use radio waves , and physical pat - downs			0
the @entity10 paper will be published in the june issue of @entity98 , an international journal of medical physics research and practice , produced by the @entity101			0
the research was conducted by @entity10 student @entity103 with @entity11 's assistance			0
a @entity31 spokesman said the agency was aware of the @entity10 study but had not yet done a thorough analysis of it .			1

the @entity31 maintains the machines are safe
the backscatter dose is " comparable " to one minute of exposure to cosmic radiation
a critic *complains* the study was based on @entity31 data instead of independent testing
