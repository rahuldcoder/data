@entity0 was 10 years old when she first began dieting			1
she had no idea she would be wrestling with her eating habits for the next three decades			2
in 2012 , after years of alternating between dieting and splurging , @entity0 had gone from " chubby little girl " to a morbidly obese woman			1
the 5 - foot - 2 paralegal from @entity10 , @entity11 , weighed 363 pounds			2
she had quit going to amusement parks and concerts because she could n't fit in the seats or walk without knee pain , and she could n't get in her car without losing her breath			2
on airplanes , she had to fly first class and still use a seat belt extender because she was too big for coach seats			2
she took showers because she could n't lift her body out of the bathtub anymore			2
@entity0 's doctor told her that her cholesterol was so bad " that i was going to have a heart attack within 10 years if i did n't change my ways			1
" besides the physical toll , her self - worth was shot			2
" i spent 30 years of my life thinking that if i could just lose this weight , then my life could begin , then i 'd make the cheerleading squad , then i could take that vacation , then i would meet the man of my dreams , etc. , " said @entity0			1
" i never felt like i was enough			2
" @entity0 , now 41 , attributes much of her weight gain to dieting at such a young age			1
" it taught me that deprivation was the only way to lose weight , and that food was bad , " she said			1
" i thought i was fatter than i actually was , and i never developed ( a healthy ) self - esteem			2
" she felt helpless , knowing her life was at risk but not knowing how to change			2
august 3 , 2012 , marked the start of her new life			2
that night , she was at a dinner for her sister 's birthday , " pigging out on the fattiest foods possible , " when her sister mentioned she had joined @entity55 and was having success with it			0
@entity0 joined @entity55 the next morning with her best friend and never looked back			1
through the company 's points system , she learned how to create a balanced meal			0
she found the system was n't as restrictive as many other diets and allowed her to enjoy foods like steak as long as they were eaten in moderation			0
@entity0 stopped eating fast food and gave up soda			1
she began to appreciate -- and eventually , to love -- fruits and vegetables			0
most importantly , she eliminated a lot of guilt by realizing that eating something unhealthy did n't equal failure			0
" in the past , if i ate what i considered non-diet food , i thought i had ruined everything , and i would quit whatever diet i was on , " @entity0 said			1
" now i know that i can still occasionally splurge , attend celebrations , go to restaurants ... because i have learned how to choose something healthy anywhere i go			0
" she would go on to lose 150 pounds			1
in the first couple of months , @entity0 's low - density lipoprotein , or @entity86 , cholesterol dropped 37 points as she made more positive changes to her eating habits and began to spend more time in the gym			1
this health change was a major landmark in preventing the heart attack that her doctor had presented as a very real threat			1
but @entity0 was not done making changes			1
from the very beginning , becoming physically strong was just as important to @entity0 as losing a lot of weight			1
in january 2014 , she made a @entity101 's resolution to go to the gym every day for a year			1
she has stayed faithful so far			0
" even if i 'm out of town i make sure to go before i leave or i rush back to get in my workout before midnight , " she said			0
" @entity0 has fitness equipment at home that she uses as well : a punching bag , an ab lounger , hand weights , kettlebells and workout dvds			1
she tries to get in about five miles of cardio every day , as well as upper and lower body weight exercises			1
she has recently discovered a passion for weightlifting and bench pressing			0
" i am very proud of my muscles , " she said			1
" i stare at them all the time			0
" @entity0 's boyfriend , @entity119 , has been her biggest cheerleader			1
he said she 's always been beautiful , but she " now has a million different smiles , each one more beautiful than the last			0
" she weighs 213 pounds and is down to a size 12			0
her ultimate goal is to weigh " 150 pounds of muscle			0
" although @entity0 has changed most dramatically on the outside , she likes to acknowledge the internal changes as well			1
" i am not afraid of what people think of me			0
i am not afraid of social situations , " she said			0
" basically , i am not afraid			0
" she said her newfound self - confidence has really helped her focus on the importance of even the smallest moment			0
" when the weekend comes , i 'm up with the birds and ready to get out of the house and make every moment count , instead of lying in bed with no energy , watching tv and eating			0
" @entity0 decided to create a @entity140 page called " @entity141 with @entity142 " to both inspire others and to keep herself accountable for achieving her weight loss goals			1
" i have had the pleasure of meeting the strongest people that i 've ever known , " she said			0
" they have embraced me every step of my journey and allowed me to inspire and motivate them to start their own weight loss journeys			2
" initially , @entity0 said she challenged her followers to work out with her every day for a month , and more than 300 people joined her in accomplishing that goal			1
" now i have a challenge group with thousands of women , and a few good men , who are all ' down with @entity142 ' and excited for every new challenge that i give them , " she said			0
" we have made weight loss fun			2
" she said it 's an amazing feeling to be the one doing the inspiring and motivating , when two years ago , " all i wanted to do was hide in a corner and cry			0
" " my struggle with obesity is the one thing in life that i always failed at , " she said			0
" to become an inspiration at your greatest failure , that is priceless			0

@entity0 started to lose weight to prevent a heart attack
she works out at the gym daily and inspires others to do the same
" i am very proud of my muscles , " she says
