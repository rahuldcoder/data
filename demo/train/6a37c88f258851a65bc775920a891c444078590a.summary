if the federal government shuts down starting tuesday because of a bitter partisan battle over the new health care law , more people say congressional @entity4 rather than president @entity5 would be responsible , according to a new national survey			1
a @entity9 / @entity8 poll released monday morning , hours before funding for the government is scheduled to run out , also indicates that most @entity12 think @entity4 in @entity13 are acting like spoiled children in this fiscal fight , with the public divided on whether the president is acting like a spoiled child or a responsible adult			1
and six in 10 questioned in the survey say they want @entity13 to approve a budget agreement to avoid a government shutdown , and if it happens , most people say a shutdown would be a bad thing for the country			1
the poll 's release comes one day after the @entity4 - dominated @entity30 approved a spending plan to fund the government that would delay the @entity33 , better known as @entity33 , for a year , and repeal its tax on medical devices			1
10 ways a shutdown would affect daily life that measure now heads back to @entity40 later monday , where the @entity42 majority has said any changes to the health care law would be a deal - killer			2
if no deal is reached on a temporary funding measure , a government shutdown would kick in at 12:01 a.m. et tuesday			2
according to the poll , which was conducted friday through sunday , 46 % say they would blame congressional @entity4 for a government shutdown , with 36 % saying the president would be more responsible and 13 % pointing fingers at both the @entity4 in @entity13 and @entity5			1
" the number who would hold congressional republicans responsible has gone down by 5 points since early september , and the number who would blame @entity5 is up 3 points in that same time , " said @entity9 polling director @entity55			2
" those changes came among most demographic groups			0
" the @entity9 poll is similar to a @entity68 / @entity67 survey released late last week that indicated 44 % blaming congressional @entity4 and 35 % pointing fingers at the president			1
two other polls conducted in the past week and a half , from @entity73 and @entity75 / @entity74 , showed a much closer margin but their questions mentioned @entity4 in general rather than the @entity4 in @entity13			0
while most @entity42 questioned in the @entity9 poll would predictably blame congressional @entity4 and most republicans questioned would point fingers at the president , independents were divided on which side they would blame			1
in a separate question , 49 % of all people in the poll say that @entity5 is acting like a responsible adult in this budget battle , with 47 % describing him as a spoiled child			2
while that 's nothing to brag about , it 's better than @entity13			0
read the entire @entity9 / @entity8 poll according to the poll , 58 % say congressional democrats are acting like spoiled children , with that number rising to 69 % for the @entity4 in @entity13			1
only one in four say congressional republicans are acting like responsible adults			0
some 68 % say a shutdown for a few days would be a bad thing for the country , with that number rising to nearly eight in 10 for a shutdown lasting a few weeks			2
six in 10 questioned in the @entity9 survey say that it is more important for @entity13 to avoid a shutdown than to make major changes to the new health care law , with only a third saying it is more important for lawmakers to prevent major provisions in the new health care law from taking effect by cutting the funds needed to implement them			1
( note : when @entity9 began interviews for this poll on friday evening , the @entity40 had just stripped out of its bill the @entity30 @entity4 measure to defund the health care law			1
what the @entity30 passed this weekend does n't specifically call for a defunding of @entity33 -- instead it delays its implementation for a year -- but the repeal on medical devices would cut key funding for the law			0
) the drive to overthrow the health care law , which was passed in 2010 when @entity42 controlled both houses of @entity13 , is being fueled by @entity4 lawmakers voted into office the past two elections with the strong support of tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives			0
" a majority of @entity4 think that blocking @entity33 is more important than approving a budget agreement , " said @entity55			1
" so do tea party supporters , regardless of their partisan affiliation			0
" " who 's driving this strategy : 40 to 50 of the most conservative members of the @entity30 , and four or five of the most conservative members of the @entity40 , " says @entity9 chief national correspondent @entity139			0
" fifty - six percent of tea party supporters say it 's a good thing to shut down the government			0
these are the folks those most conservative members of @entity13 are listening to			0
those lawmakers think back home they 're on safe ground even though nationally shutting down the government is a non-starter			0
" the poll indicates that @entity33 is not popular , with 57 % saying they oppose the law , up 3 points from may , and 38 % saying they support the measure , down five points from may			1
but only about four in 10 oppose it because it is too liberal , with about one in 10 saying they do n't like the law because it is not liberal enough			0
if you add the 38 % who favor the law to the 11 % to oppose the law because it 's not liberal enough , you get 49 % , compared with the 39 % who say they oppose the law because it 's too liberal			0
the poll was conducted for @entity9 by @entity8 september 27 - 29 , with 803 adults nationwide questioned by telephone			1
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points			0
the questions where do you stand ? add your thoughts in the comments below : @entity179 : if the federal government shuts down , do you think that @entity5 or the @entity4 in @entity13 would be more responsible for that ? @entity179 : do you think @entity5 has acted mostly like a responsible adult or mostly like a spoiled child during the recent debate over the federal budget ? @entity179 : do you think the @entity4 in @entity13 have acted mostly like responsible adults or mostly like spoiled children during the recent debate over the federal budget ? @entity179 : do you think the @entity42 in @entity13 have acted mostly like responsible adults or mostly like spoiled children during the recent debate over the federal budget ? a political game of chicken as shutdown looms @entity30 @entity4 : @entity40 is running out the clock architect of the brink : meet the man behind the looming shutdown			2
