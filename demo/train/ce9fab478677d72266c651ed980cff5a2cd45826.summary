" let the sunshine , let the sunshine in ...			0
" my wife @entity2 blurted into a song this week , as she gazed eastwards through the window of our apartment in downtown @entity8			1
the old tune from the @entity10 show " hair " seemed apt. this is the fourth consecutive morning that we woke up staring at a grey haze			0
it 's another bad - air day in @entity8			1
but you can feel -- and even taste -- the grit floating in the air			2
the @entity20 has set healthy level of @entity22 at 25 micrograms , while @entity8 considers a 300 reading as " @entity24 " and 500 as " hazardous			1
" last weekend , however , it breached 700 ! " i 'm getting itchy , " complained my daughter @entity27 , 22 , visiting us from @entity30			0
" i could feel it at the back of my throat			0
" longtime expatriate residents in the @entity36 capital jokingly call it the " @entity8 tickle , " a nagging cough that takes a long time to shrug off			1
@entity8 adopts emergency measures for hazardous pollution air pollution is a major problem in @entity36 because of the country 's rapid pace of industrialization , reliance on coal power , explosive growth in car ownership and the sometimes disregard for environmental laws			1
it is now paying the price of rapid development			0
in 2007 , @entity36 overtook the @entity56 as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , according to @entity36 's @entity60			1
it is also the no. 1 source of carbon emission worldwide , state - run @entity64 reported recently			1
added to this , the @entity65 says 20 of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are in @entity36			1
health is the big casualty			1
almost 400,000 premature deaths are recorded in @entity36 each year , with the majority related to pollution , according to the @entity65 's " @entity74 in @entity36 , " a report based on official @entity36 figures			1
a growing number of individuals and institutions are looking to find last - gasp solutions			2
the government has already shut down high - polluting factories , built new subway lines , and allocated state subsidies to reduce the cost of public transport			2
@entity8 bans vehicles from the road one day a week to reduce heavy traffic and vehicle emissions			2
it also imports natural gas from other provinces to rely less on coal for heating and cooking			0
as part of a long - term solution , @entity36 researchers are producing prototypes of solar and electric cars to replace gas - fueled vehicles			1
so far , these measures have not produced consistently blue skies and clean air			2
@entity107 activists complain that even though government regulations have improved , laws are often ignored			0
one of @entity8 's big problems has been the city 's geography , as it is surrounded by mountains shaped like a horseshoe			1
when pollution blows in from the heavily industrial neighboring towns and cities , it builds up and , in windless days , gets trapped over the capital			2
off - the - charts pollution in @entity36 in fact , this is not the first time bad air has bedeviled @entity8			1
i remember one day last year when the @entity56 embassy 's air monitoring system reported the pollution level as " crazy bad			1
" what can we @entity8 residents do about it ? wear face masks ? unless you use heavy - duty ones , i am told , they do not really make much difference			1
turn on air - purifiers full blast ? we 've never used one at home , although my friends swear they help			2
" the truth is there is n't a lot people can do about ambient air pollution , " said @entity143 , an environment and energy specialist at the @entity146 , a @entity56 based think tank			1
" @entity151 air pollution is not nearly as large a health risk as more immediate forms of air pollution			1
tobacco is a much larger killer , and indoor air pollution from poorly ventilated wood and coal fires has traditionally been a much larger killer in the developing world			1
@entity163 restaurants and bars can have levels as high as these recent air pollution numbers			1
" i know a few expat friends who have decided to relocate out of @entity8 and were mainly turned off by its bad air			1
" what did you think of @entity8 ? " i asked @entity173 , who lived and worked in @entity8 for nearly seven years before relocating to @entity174 last year			2
" mostly liked it , save for the @entity176 ( censorship ) and pollution , " he said			2
meantime , some residents have resorted to humor and sarcasm online to vent their frustration			0
" i love my city , but i refuse to be a human vacuum cleaner , " netizens re-tweeted on @entity187 , @entity36 's microblogging social media			1
" we want clean air , and we want to breathe freely			0
" others posted pictures wearing face masks of various shapes and designs			0
a page of @entity196 featured a section covered with haze , with a note saying the headlines have been obscured by a massive smog			0
" click on it , and it will clear up			0
" once it cleared it , the title read : " we live in a " toxic gas			0
' " " do n't worry , " @entity207 posted on my @entity209 page			0
" smokers are inhaling worst air than this			0
and they did not die immediately ! " is this now the new " normal " ? @entity143 , who lived in @entity8 for 14 years , does not think so			2
" this is a confluence of bad events , " she assured me			0
" pollution is definitely a problem			0
it has n't gone away , but there is no reason to believe an extreme reading is anything other than an extreme			0
" there seems to be no quick solution			0
" this is complex and takes time , but the work has begun , " @entity143 added			0
" it took cities like @entity232 and @entity233 almost half a century to get from really dirty air to pretty clean air , and @entity233 has never actually fully met @entity237 standards , which have become tougher with new information			0
" five days after what some have dubbed @entity8 's " air - mageddon , " the sunshine has reappeared , and the air has actually turned relatively clear			1
my daughter points out that @entity232 and @entity233 have confronted pollution as well			0
as long as the @entity36 recognize it is a problem , they will eventually be able to strike a balance between a clean environment and a thriving economy			2
" @entity252 has dispersed some of the smog , although my chest remains heavy and my throat is still itchy .			0
