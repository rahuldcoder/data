-- @entity1 , the latest star of @entity3 's " the bachelor , " has gone from stud to dud faster than he could hand out his final rose			1
the former pro soccer player and first @entity7 " in series history was initially adored by the show 's fan base , who saw @entity1 , 32 , as a sweet , romantic single father searching for " everlasting love			1
" his appearance on the 18th season of " the bachelor , " which debuted in january , was so hyped that @entity3 dubbed the month " @entity1 - uary " in his honor			1
but even before monday night 's season finale and surprising " after the @entity18 " post-finale special , @entity1 was being called " the worst ' bachelor ' ever " -- which is saying a lot , because this franchise has had some doozies			1
( see : @entity23 , @entity24 ) so how did @entity1 pull off such a rapid downfall ? in six easy steps : 1			1
made controversial comments about marriage and sexuality by the third episode , @entity1 was already losing viewers			1
the reality star , who 'd previously appeared on @entity3 's " @entity33 , " was asked at a network party whether he thought it would be " good at some point to have a gay or bisexual bachelor			0
" @entity1 then gave a long response that included statements like , " i do n't think it is a good example for kids to watch that on tv , " and , " there 's this thing about gay people			2
... they 're more pervert in a sense			0
" we should note that @entity1 , who 's lived in @entity50 , does have a language barrier , and when he apologized for offending anyone he said that he 'd chosen the wrong words			2
whether his true meaning was lost in translation or not , the comments left a cloud over the rest of the season			2
caused one woman to accuse him of being a ' narcissist ' and an ' a * * * ole ' after the scandal over his views on sexuality , @entity1 plowed ahead through his options on " @entity67			1
" by the time he narrowed the 27 women vying to be his next bride to the final few , at least one of the contestants , @entity72 , could n't stand him			0
after spending time in " the fantasy suite " with @entity1 , @entity72 said she " could not wait " to get out of the show			1
" i saw a side to him that i did n't really like , " she said during that episode			0
" there 's a difference between being honest and being an a * * * ole			0
" later , @entity72 explained that she was " turned off " by him and his " borderline narcissistic " perspective			0
watching the ambivalence some of the contestants developed for @entity1 -- including from @entity84 , another contestant who decided that he was n't what she was looking for in a mate -- did n't help the athlete win any " best ' bachelor ' " awards			2
caused another woman to cry his interactions with the women on the show only went downhill , as one of the final two ladies , @entity95 , accused @entity1 of saying an overtly sexual comment to her when the cameras stopped rolling during a helicopter ride			1
" as the helicopter 's landing , we have a rare moment together with no cameras , nobody there with us and @entity1 leaned over and whispered something to me , " @entity95 said			2
" he chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear			2
it was insulting , it was offensive and it just made me feel awful			0
" to make matters worse , @entity95 is also the same woman who broke down in tears after @entity1 told her he regretted a late - night swim session with her			1
although she made it into the final two , @entity1 did n't propose to @entity95 -- and then commented aloud how glad he was that he did n't			1
did n't propose during the final show we already know what happened to @entity95 , but the other final woman , @entity121 , " won " this season only by a technicality			1
@entity1 picked out an engagement ring but then refused to put it on her finger because he was n't " 100 % sure " he wanted to propose			1
( the ring is now reportedly with " bachelor " producers			0
refused to say the ' l ' word similarly , @entity1 was just as evasive about his relationship with @entity121 on monday 's " after the @entity18 " special			1
when " bachelor " host @entity132 asked him directly whether he was in love with @entity121 , @entity1 replied , " i 'm not going to answer that question			2
" his potential future fiance , at least , is n't bothered by his inability to express his devotion verbally			0
" it 's not that he does n't tell me -- it 's like in his actions , " @entity121 said			0
" i know that he does ( love me )			0
i know that he cares about me a lot			0
" viewers at home do n't know that , though			2
as tv without @entity149 put it , " congrats to # @entity152 for the most horrifically strange and uncomfortable @entity153 in franchise history			0
got celebrities to hate him " omg i want to stab this narcissistic idiot ... @entity159 , " @entity158 tweeted on monday			0
" i hate this a * * * @entity161 ! ! ! he is a jerk ! ! ! ! straight up ! ! " @entity163 agreed , chiming in , " is n't he a disappointment ? " to " bachelor " fans , apparently so .			0

@entity1 has had a rapid downfall as " @entity67 "
it began with *homophobic* comments and then *spiraled* with his *behavior* on the show
his refusal to propose or say the " l " word to the woman he chose has *enraged* viewers
