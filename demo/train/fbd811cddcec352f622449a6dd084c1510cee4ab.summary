@entity0 -- members of @entity3 focused on the @entity6 's soldier - performance review and promotion process wednesday , questioning the chief investigators behind a @entity9 report examining november 's shootings at @entity11 , @entity12			1
" this guy was a walking time bomb , " said rep. @entity13 , @entity14 , referring to maj. @entity15 , an @entity6 psychiatrist and the alleged shooter in a rampage that killed 13 people and wounded 43			1
@entity13 and other members of the @entity22 questioned @entity23 , former @entity6 secretary ; and retired @entity26 adm. @entity25 , who explained their review of the shooting			1
committee members asked about issues surrounding the incident , including protection for soldiers on base , emergency response policies and efforts to recognize soldiers exhibiting erratic , radical or violent behavior			2
but many on the committee wanted to know specifically about the @entity6 's performance evaluation process , including whether performance reviews are watered down in an attempt to shift problem employees elsewhere			1
" i am particularly concerned about the system of officer evaluation in the @entity6 and other services , " said committee chairman @entity46 , @entity48			1
" the performance reports ... must accurately reflect the strengths and weaknesses of officers			2
problems must not be passed from one assignment to another			0
" @entity15 was promoted to the rank of major in may despite weak performance reviews and reports that he was becoming increasingly radical			1
@entity13 acknowledged that one of the most difficult things about being a manager is firing or demoting employees and dealing with subsequent legal issues			0
" it does n't make any of us feel good , " she said			0
" we tend to move them on			0
" @entity13 said including poor performance reviews in a soldier 's file can have far - reaching implications , and managers often consider " how much you can damage the career of someone who has made the military their career			1
" like other committee members , she asked the panel about military constituents who have sought psychological help , only to have their careers negatively affected by doing so			2
" i wish to goodness that i was not constrained from talking about this , " he said , referring to the classified parts of the report he was n't allowed to discuss publicly			0
@entity15 's commanders " were responsible for developing him and educating him and training him in the field of medicine , and as an officer in the @entity6			1
our impression -- and the words in our report are as straightforward as we can say them -- it needed work			0
" @entity23 , who is also a former secretary of veterans affairs , sympathized with the difficulties commanders face when writing performance reviews			2
he described what basically amounts to a fine line between " damaging careers with hasty judgments , " or conversely , simply passing off a sub-par employee			0
he said there 's " tension " for commanders regarding when to act on information versus when not to , and what should be passed along versus what should n't be			0
but , he said , " evaluations make a difference , and we ca n't do the job of leading or protecting against threats if honest evaluations are not done by those who have the duty , the information , and the authority to do so			0
