-- it was only a year and a half ago that a phenomenon swept the globe and made basketball fans a little , well , " @entity5			0
" remember that ? back then , @entity7 had a historic run that led the @entity9 on a winning streak , dubbed " @entity11			1
" crowds fell for the feel - good story of an overlooked bench - warmer who slept on friends ' sofas to take a shot in the @entity19			1
a new documentary takes a look at the life of @entity7 before the madness			1
" @entity11 , " out in select theaters october 4 , offers a glimpse of @entity7 's road to stardom : he was a standout basketball player in summer leagues , competed in a tightly contested high school state championship and faced racial epithets as an @entity33 athlete before landing , undrafted , in the professional league			1
from the documentary , it 's clear the 25 - year - old @entity7 was used to being an underdog , and overcame his share of challenges with a deep faith and persistent spirit			1
" i 'm always trying to have a good time , joking around , goofy , " he said			0
" i think i try not to take anything really too seriously			0
" in this edited conversation , @entity0 spoke to @entity7 , now with the @entity46 , about how his faith sustains him , what he learned from his months in the brightest spotlight and how he responds to racism			1
@entity0 : what did you learn from @entity11 ? @entity7 : i learned a lot of things			1
i learned ... about how fame and success , worldly success , are great , but they are empty in a lot of different ways , and i think i learned that emptiness through @entity11			1
i also learned you know , how fun it can be and i remember how fun it was to play basketball and to play at that level and to play with my teammates			0
that was definitely a lifelong memory as well			0
@entity0 : when some think of professional sports , there 's obviously the hard work and teamwork , but it also has a reputation for hype and kind of bragging rights			1
it 's a contrast to the characteristics of humility taught in @entity81			2
how do you balance the two roles as a competitive player , and a faithful @entity85 ? @entity7 : i think there 's definitely a delicate balance that you need to be aware of , but i think at the end of the day , you can be confident in your own abilities and you can understand this is what i 'm good at , this is what has gotten me here			1
but at the same time you can also understand that it 's a team game and that no one man is above another person and there 's still a way you need to treat your coaches and teammates , your opponents , the fans , the refs : being able to have a humble demeanor and be able to treat everyone with respect			2
i think there are certain players who , when they become really good , they look down on other people			0
and there are certain players , when they are really good , they bring and elevate the level of their teammates and their entire team and they bring everybody up with them			0
@entity0 : speaking of building a life @entity118 has called you to live , what were some of your go - to scriptures , stories or prayers that helped you through difficult moments ? @entity7 : through difficult moments i 'd say @entity125 5:3 - 5 and @entity125 8:28 talk about just being able to deal with really tough situations in life and being able to have peace beyond circumstances			1
and i think in terms of just playing basketball in my career , i think the story of @entity135 walking on water really jumps out to me -- how , when his eyes were focused on @entity138 , he was able to walk on water , but the minute the waves came and the wind came and he got distracted , he lost his footing			0
that kind of represents the distractions of the world , and i think the good part of the story is @entity138 reaches down and picks him up , and i think that 's very indicative of our relationship , and our life on earth			2
@entity0 : you 've spoke about the racism you faced as a top basketball player being overlooked kind of at every instance of your career			0
how do you respond to it now , versus when you were younger ? @entity7 : when i was younger , i let it affect me , i let it boil inside of me			2
and now i just kind of just brush it off			0
i 'm used to it , you know , and when someone 's not racist or when i do n't have to deal with racism , it 's actually a pleasant surprise , i 'm like , " oh , wow , that 's really cool			2
" so , it 's just something that i 've learned to embrace -- like this is just the world that we live in , and it 's ok			2
i think everybody has their preconceptions and that 's ok			0
and i think that just as long as we 're constantly evolving in terms of our understanding and our perspective , as long as we do that , i think we 're on the right path			0
@entity0 : what did you think you would do if you did n't play professional basketball ? do you ever think about life after the @entity19 and what that looks like ? @entity7 : afterward , i probably want to do some type of @entity192 , or do some type of nonprofit work			1
that 's probably what i 'd be doing if i was n't playing basketball right now .			0
