-- get your brain ready for a game show that requires no knowledge of trivia or prices -- just curiosity			1
@entity8 is premiering monday night a new series called " @entity10 , " a fun , smart show that , in a nontraditional way , teaches you how your mind works			1
" my hope is that people come out of it in awe of themselves , " said host @entity16 , formerly a presenter on @entity18			1
each episode zooms in on a different aspect of how our brains work , in areas such as focus , fear , motion and persuasion			1
during each half - hour program , viewers engage in several games that show how our brains might not be operating the way we expect			1
experts in various fields of cognition join in to explain what 's going on			1
through perceptual experiments , interactive games and illusions , the show is able to , in a sense , " hack your brain , " @entity16 said			1
you might think that everything you see is like high - definition tv , that you perceive the world around you in perfect detail			1
but the truth is that the attentional spotlight of your brain is only about the size of your thumbnail ; about 1/1000th of your field of view			1
as @entity16 says on the show : it 's as if your attention is a spotlight , and you can only shine it on one thing at a time			1
this is your brain on music your brain fills in the rest on its own , in order to save energy , so everything around you does n't immediately jump out and demand focus			2
perhaps you have noticed , for instance , that while commuting to work you are thinking about all sorts of things that do n't involve being in the car , train or bus that you ride every day			2
your brain has already stored a model of your environment , so you might not notice something unusual right next to you			2
that 's called inattentional blindness			2
" the brain creates these mental models of the world so that you can function , but the consequence is that it makes you less present , so we do n't notice what 's around us on a regular basis , " @entity16 said			2
" we 're blind to what surrounds us			2
" @entity90 , a performer and expert in deception , takes advantage of that fact when playing card tricks and engaging in other trickery on the show			1
you might think of this as " misdirection , " but @entity90 says in a video on the show 's website that he likes to think of it as " managing attention			2
" in one episode , he gets many volunteers to look through a deck of cards for the card they started with			1
actually , the card is on @entity90 ' head , but they 're so focused on the task that they do n't immediately notice			1
" even backstage , he 's able to weave my attention in any direction that he wants , " @entity16 said			2
top brain scientist is ' philosopher at heart ' another game makes use of the relatively poor peripheral vision that we all have			1
there 's a giant x in the middle of the screen and two cheerleaders on either side of it			0
if you keep your eyes focused on the @entity125 , can you tell which one of the cheerleaders is actually a man wearing a skirt and a wig ? it 's a lot harder than you might think			0
the show is particularly relevant now , given recent movements toward advancing brain science , @entity16 said			0
earlier this month , president @entity142 announced a $ 100 million initiative called @entity144 , or @entity144			0
it " aims to help researchers find new ways to treat , cure and even prevent brain disorders , such as alzheimer 's disease , epilepsy and traumatic brain injury , " the @entity145 said in a release			0
another major brain research initiative is called the @entity154 , based in @entity155			0
scientists at the @entity154 are using supercomputers to simulate the way the brain works in order to understand it better			0
@entity161 at the @entity162 in @entity163 is leading this effort			0
in january , the @entity165 awarded this international effort about € 1 billion ( $ 1.3 billion )			0
the show 's executive producer , @entity167 , said he wanted to make a game show where the viewer would also be contestants			0
he wanted it to be a " science show without the 's - word			0
' " of course , the " s - word " is " science			0
" @entity167 said he was personally amazed by the episode on fear , in which the show explores how the stress we feel in modern life about things like an overflowing e-mail inbox are derivative of fear			0
the fear response is something that evolved in humans , and dates back to when our primitive ancestors had to be on high alert in case of animal attacks			0
" our brain wants us to feel stress in situations that are uncomfortable , " @entity167 said			0
" that 's its way of putting you on alert			0
" what 's different now , of course , is that in modern life , the stress response is being triggered dozens of times a day , which is n't healthy , he said			0
" @entity10 " premieres at 9 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. et / pt monday on the @entity8			1
you can learn more about " @entity10 , " play games and watch additional videos on the show 's website .			1

" @entity10 " *incorporates* *optical* illusions and perceptual tricks
your peripheral vision is probably weaker than you think
card tricks can take advantage of your small attentional spotlight
