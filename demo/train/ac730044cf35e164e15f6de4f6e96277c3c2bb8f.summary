editor 's note : @entity2 is managing director of the @entity4 at the @entity5 , a think tank that promotes thought from across the ideological spectrum			1
he has worked for @entity7 , former @entity9 gov. @entity8 and former @entity11 gov. @entity10			0
@entity2 says @entity12 has to justify its bailout while @entity14 is getting more without tough scrutiny			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- there was good news and bad news in the recent filings @entity22 and @entity23 made with the federal officials overseeing their multibillion - dollar rescue			2
the good news was that , if the federal government can see its way clear to adding another $ 21 billion or so to the more than $ 17.4 billion they received in bridge loans in december -- including a cool $ 7 billion by the end of march to forestall their insolvency -- the companies are confident that they will be able to retool , return to profitability and repay the money provided them			1
the bad news : it wo n't happen until late in president @entity40 's first term , if at all , and in the meantime they will eliminate at least 50,000 jobs this year alone , close even more plants than previously announced and discontinue several of their most recognizable lines of cars			2
if you think keeping the automakers afloat for another few years is expensive , you wo n't believe how much it would cost to let them fail			2
in the same report , @entity23 ceo @entity52 put the price tag for the feds should his company file for bankruptcy at $ 100 billion			0
such is the through - the - looking - glass nature of bailout economics , circa 2009			0
of course , even @entity52 's worst case scenario is a pittance compared to the more than $ 600 billion that will eventually flow to @entity14 through the @entity64 ( @entity64 )			1
which begs the question of why , after four months and nearly $ 400 billion in capital from the @entity69 , we have still not seen anything remotely resembling the detailed disclosures and strategic planning required of the automakers from the banks that have received @entity64 funds ? for that matter , should n't the state and local governments that stand to receive hundreds of billions of dollars under the recently enacted economic stimulus bill have to submit something , anything , that would explain how they intend to use this money , what their spending will do to speed and sustain the nation 's overall recovery and what they will do to wean themselves from this emergency aid once the crisis has passed ? small nonprofits and community organizations that receive federal grants will tell you that the paperwork and scrutiny that comes with even the most modest federal award is often so exhaustive as to nullify the benefits of the grant			1
not so , apparently , if your request is in the billions			0
perhaps the secret to avoiding the withering glances of bean - counting bureaucrats is to ask for serious cash from @entity107			0
how do we square the double standard in reporting required of @entity22 and @entity23 , whose combined request is in the range of $ 40 billion , with the inability of even a pit bull like @entity118 @entity117 chairman @entity116 , @entity11 , to get answers as to exactly where and to what end the @entity64 money has gone ? it may be that the situation on @entity14 is so complex , and the stakes so high , that lawmakers themselves have little confidence in their abilities to map a successful recovery for the industry , so they are relying on the sheer magnitude of their spending and the ingenuity of those left standing on @entity14 to work their market magic and revive the economy			1
the idea of a single " @entity137 " to oversee the rebuilding of the auto industry is now out the window , replaced by a task force led by treasury secretary @entity142 and @entity144 director @entity143 , two of the most over-extended men in the history of @entity118 government			1
but it 's still easier for @entity16 to imagine that they can manage @entity22 and @entity23 back onto the road to viability than that anything short of massive infusions of vaguely traceable capital will unfreeze the credit markets and restore financial stability			0
in the meantime , the automakers await word on the acceptability of their plans to dramatically reduce production and add tens of thousands of new @entity118 to the ranks of the unemployed			0
forty billion just does n't go as far as it used to			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : auto companies are planning job cuts and plant closings
he says they were required to give detailed plans in return for bailout money
@entity2 : @entity14 firms getting much more money from federal government
he says the bankers have n't been required to provide their *restructuring* plan
