he was a big boy			0
a very , very big boy			0
in fact , the @entity3 dinosaur unveiled thursday was one of the biggest -- if not the biggest -- land animal ever to grace the @entity7			1
experts estimate that back in its day -- the upper @entity11 period , approximately 77 million years ago -- this giant measured 85 feet long and weighed about 65 tons			1
no wonder , then , paleontologists picked a first name that breaks down to " fear nothing			0
" ( the second name honors benefactor and tech entrepreneur @entity16			0
) you would n't be scared , either , if you towered over every creature in sight , could smash most anything with your whip - like tail and could smoosh most anything with your colossal feet			1
" @entity3 was astoundingly huge , " said @entity24 , the lead author of the report published in @entity26 , as quoted on his school @entity28 's website			1
" it weighed as much as a dozen african elephants or more than seven @entity31			1
" the fossilized remains of this @entity33 were unearthed recently in @entity35 's southwestern @entity34			1
8 places for fantastic fossil finds and to think the massive dinosaur pieced together by @entity24 's team was still growing up , according to expert analysis			1
it 's hard to say how much bigger this or other @entity43 may have gotten had it fully matured			0
nor , without a time machine , can one quickly determine whether this new species was bigger than fellow titanosaurs such as the similarly gargantuan @entity48			1
that 's mostly because other finds like these are relatively incomplete , forcing paleontologists to make estimates based off a bone or two here and there			0
" titanosaurs are a remarkable group of dinosaurs , with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale or more , " said @entity57 , a @entity59 scholar who was part of the team , in the @entity28 piece			1
" but the biggest dinosaurs have remained a mystery because , in almost all cases , their fossils are very incomplete			0
" not so with the new @entity33 specimen , which is another big reason -- big being the operative word for everything about this creature -- it 's so special			2
those who excavated the sometimes snow - covered terrain not far from @entity81 were able to locate more than 70 % of the @entity33 ' bones , including part of a jaw			2
compare that to maybe 3 % to 27 % for other dinosaur finds of its kind			2
@entity24 characterized the discovery as " by far the best example we have of any of the most giant creatures to ever walk the planet			1
" as heavy as 14 elephants , as long as 2 tractor trailers : meet mr. @entity96 and it 's not like the scientists unearthed little chicken bones			2
a picture @entity24 posted to @entity101 showed a woman next to one of @entity33 ' scapulas , or shoulder blades , both roughly the same size			0
its humerus , or upper arm , bone was taller than the @entity28 professor			0
a neck vertebra measured about 3 feet in diameter			2
all these things -- from fossils of large bones to a single tooth , from part of a jaw to toes and a claw -- coupled with digital technology could help to learn a great deal about the @entity33 and other titanosaurs ' lived in their era , beyond the fact it had a 37 - foot - long neck and 30 - foot - long tail			1
one thing that it would have had to do , to get this big , is eat			0
( and it was all plants , proving your mom right that veggies can make you big and strong			0
) @entity24 thinks the @entity33 must have had " a life - long obsession with eating , " perhaps spending all its waking existence chomping leaves from giant tree after giant tree			1
he said , " every day is about taking in enough calories to nourish this house - sized body			2
" treasure trove of prehistoric animal remains discovered			0

@entity3 , a dinosaur species , was recently discovered in @entity34
experts estimate the specimen was 85 feet long ( with a 30 - foot tail ) , weighed 65 tons
paleontologist : this is the " best example we have of any of the most giant creatures "
