-- the rebel battalions and commanders battling @entity6 president @entity5 's regime are signing a " code of conduct " pledging to refrain from torture and other human rights abuses , an opposition group said wednesday			1
more than two dozen @entity12 officials have signed the documents , just days after an uproar over reports that a unit called the @entity17 claimed responsibility for executing pro-regime members of the @entity21 clan in @entity22 , the opposition @entity10 said			1
@entity23 , the @entity10 english - language spokeswoman , said some of the content in the code had been in development for months by human rights experts and the @entity10 and @entity12			1
but the work was accelerated in the wake of the executions last week , she said			1
the @entity5 regime has been widely condemned for torture and other human rights abuses			1
but as the rebel army has evolved , reports have surfaced of mistreatment by rebel fighters as well , including @entity0 's own reporting on a rebel - run prison last week			1
the reported executions last week highlighted fears that rebels are intent on revenge killings and sectarian retribution			2
" as the ranks of the @entity12 expand and its brave fighters fight a national , multi-front battle , there has become a need for rules to govern their work			2
these rules must combine the spirit of the national duty they carry out today in facing the aggressor , @entity5 and his regime , and moving towards the regime 's ouster and the interests of justice and military discipline , " the @entity10 said			2
