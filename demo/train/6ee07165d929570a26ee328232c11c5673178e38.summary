-- if you were to ask my friends back in high school , they would probably say i was one of the lucky ones			0
i had a face most people at least considered attractive , maybe even beautiful			1
and for much of my life i had an hourglass figure			0
@entity11 wrote " @entity12 : one @entity16 , " ' @entity15 's wife " and " daughter			1
" but as 40 approached and my figure , um , filled out , i would look in the mirror and no longer see myself as sexy			0
then one night that changed			0
i was at a meeting in a small town with a group of young women who were reading from my most recent book , a memoir that discussed my history of depression and surviving abuse			1
after the gathering ended , one of the women approached me			1
she told me that while she was growing up , she had been told to shut up so often she just did it automatically			0
it felt good to hear someone give voice to how she felt inside , she said			0
we talked about all the things that kept us silent and shut down			0
she promised to speak out more from that day on			0
as she walked away , something came over me : i felt ignited , energized ... yes , beautiful			1
@entity0 : 34 low - cost , make - you - smile ideas and the more i thought about that woman and our conversation , the more i realized that it was n't just those instances of bonding or appreciation at public readings that triggered my inner glow ; it was my own solitary engagement with language			1
what makes you feel beautiful ? writing requires us to take the world on more slowly , to notice its harshness as well as its richness			1
writing reduces the chaos in my mind			2
as the gospel song says , it orders my steps and makes me feel in control of myself and therefore appreciative of the world			1
@entity0 : keep your mind and body in top condition women do n't get enough credit for the amount of self we invest in our work			2
in the last year , watching some of the most talented women i know being laid off has been tough			2
knowing that the work they loved -- whether in finance , real estate , or writing -- may be gone forever has been downright devastating , and their grief over this loss is boundless			1
" i feel like nothing , like i just want to disappear , " said one brilliant friend			2
" losing my job is like the worst breakup i 've ever been through , " said another			2
in the midst of this carnage , i 've clung ever tighter to my work -- not so much to the money - making part of it , which ebbs and flows ( mostly ebbs , lately ) , but to the basic joy i 've always taken in words ; that at least does n't go anywhere			0
@entity0 : how to worry less for so long i had measured my beauty ( and , really , my worth ) by my dress size			1
and , hey , i would love , i mean love , to be a size 6 again			0
still , every time i give a lecture or teach a workshop and touch someone -- or write a page and reach a deeper part of myself -- i feel so useful and relevant			0
it translates to a more profound feeling of beauty than the rush i once got from someone admiring my breast size			1
i like superficial praise as much as the next person , but at 40 the love finally had to go deeper , did n't it ? get a free trial issue of @entity116 ! copyright Â© 2009 @entity118 all rights reserved .			0

author notes how many women are *emotionally* devastated by job loss
@entity11 used to measure beauty , self worth by her dress size
now she 's realized her own solitary writing makes her feel beautiful
and says touching others through her words is a more profound beauty
