-- two weeks after the disappearance of @entity2 , finding it remains a global search - and - rescue effort			1
the bulk of the attention is on the southern @entity6 , where a commercial satellite photographed objects that @entity10 authorities say could be related to the search			1
authorities have called the find the best lead yet on where the missing plane might be , and it has prompted a massive search in the area more than 1,500 miles ( 2,400 kilometers ) southwest of @entity10			1
so far , they have turned up nothing			0
what 's the very latest ? @entity10 officials say six planes were continuing the search saturday after nothing was found in the area friday			1
@entity25 's @entity24 published what it said was part of a transcript of the final communications between the @entity31 flight cockpit and air traffic controllers			2
it shows only routine technical chatter			0
@entity0 has not independently verified that the transcript is genuine			0
the ceo of @entity31 confirmed that the plane was carrying lithium - ion batteries			1
and authorities said they 're aware of a news report that the plane 's pilot placed a cell phone call shortly before the flight departed			1
what 's the significance of the phone call ? there may not be any , but in a mystery as big as this one , investigators will check out any lead to see if it 's important			1
and what about the batteries ? lithium - ion batteries are the type commonly used in laptops and cell phones , and have been known to explode , although it is a rare occurrence			2
a fire attributed to lithium - ion batteries caused the fatal 2010 crash of a @entity63 cargo plane in @entity64			1
lithium - ion batteries used to power components in @entity68 aircraft were also implicated in a series of fires affecting that plane			1
so , in theory , a cargo of the batteries could have caused a fire that led @entity2 to crash			1
but @entity31 ceo @entity77 told reporters the batteries were routine cargo			2
" they are not declared dangerous goods , " he said , adding that they were " some small batteries , not big batteries			1
" it 's been two days since we saw the satellite photos of floating objects			1
why have n't searchers found anything ? the area being searched is enormous and remote			2
aircraft can stay over the scene just two hours before having to return to base			0
and given that the objects spotted on satellite could have drifted hundreds of miles since they were photographed sunday , or maybe have even sunk by now , finding them is n't a simple proposition			1
@entity99 is sending surveillance planes , more merchant ships are on the way , and @entity10 , @entity25 , @entity103 and @entity104 are all sending ships to the area -- a remote region far from commercial shipping and air lanes			1
is it possible that the plane would have gone that far ? investigators think so			2
they concluded the plane flew for hours after disappearing from radar , and calculated a pair of arcs running north and south from the @entity117 for likely locations			2
based on those trajectories , the amount of fuel on board and other factors , experts believe the plane could have made it to the southern @entity6			1
when will we know whether the objects are from the missing flight ? maybe never			2
searchers might miss them , or they might have sunk by now			0
but even if they do find the objects , the process of determining whether they 're from the missing flight could still be lengthy			2
" we have to locate it , confirm that it belongs to the aircraft , recover it and then bring it a long way back to @entity10 , so that could take some time , " said @entity135 , general manager of emergency response for the @entity137 , could pieces of the plane still be floating ? probably not any big pieces , according to @entity148 , the @entity149 's former director of accident investigation			1
but pieces of lightweight debris , such as life jackets and seat cushions , can float for days after an aircraft strikes the water , he said			0
if it 's not the plane , what else could it be ? almost anything big and buoyant			1
the objects were spotted in a part of the @entity6 known for swirling currents called gyres that can trap all sorts of floating debris			1
among the leading contenders for what the objects might be , assuming they 're not part of flight 370 : shipping containers that fell off a passing cargo vessel			0
there are reasons to doubt that theory , however			0
the area is n't near commercial shipping lanes , and the larger object , at an estimated 79 feet ( 24 meters ) , would seem to be nearly twice as long as a standard shipping container			0
if it is the plane , would its location tell us anything about what happened on that flight ? if it really is the wreckage of the @entity68 777 - 200 , its far southern location would provide investigators with precious clues into what terrible events unfolded to result in the disappearance and loss of the airliner , according to @entity195 , editor - in - chief of @entity196 and a commercial jet - rated pilot			1
" the location would suggest a few very important parameters			0
the spot where searchers have found hoped - for clues is , based on the location information provided by the @entity10 government , nearly 4,000 miles from where the airliner made its unexpected and as yet unexplained turn to the west , " @entity195 wrote			2
the first obvious clue is that the airplane flew for many hours			0
what do the satellite images show ? two indistinct objects , one about 79 feet ( 24 meters ) in length and the other about 16 feet ( 5 meters ) long			2
though they do n't look like much to the untrained observer , @entity10 intelligence imagery experts who looked at the pictures saw enough to pass them along to the maritime safety agency , @entity135 said			2
" those who are expert indicate they are credible sightings			0
and the indication to me is of objects that are reasonable size and are probably awash with water , bobbing up and down out of the surface , " he said			0
how old are the images ? they were taken by commercial satellite imaging company @entity231 on sunday			0
why did we first hear about them on thursday , then ? basically , the @entity10 say , it 's because the @entity6 is a very big place			1
the maritime safety authority said it took four days for the images to reach it " due to the volume of imagery being searched and the detailed process of analysis that followed			0
" who is running the search ? the @entity10 are in charge of the search in their area of responsibility , which includes a large area of the southern @entity6 off @entity10 's west coast			1
@entity104 remains in overall control of the search			0
how did they know to look in this area ? investigators analyzing satellite pings sent by the plane concluded it was traveling along one of two arcs away from the @entity117			2
@entity264 officials have said they believe the plane most likely traveled south and crashed into the @entity6			1
searchers narrowed the area of interest by calculating the most likely locations based on time in the air , fuel usage and other factors			0
it 's already been 14 days			0
are we running out of time to find this plane ? the locator beacons attached to flight data recorders are designed to ping for at least 30 days , but will probably keep going at full strength up to five days longer , said @entity280 , president of @entity281 , the @entity282 company that believes it made @entity2 's beacons			1
" our predictive models and lab tests show 33 - 35 days of output before we drop below the minimal values , " @entity280 told @entity0			0
" depending on the age of the battery , it could continue pinging for a few days longer			0
" pinging is one thing			0
finding the pings is another			0
not only is the area being searched vast , it is deep -- up to 13,000 feet in many places			0
given that the pingers can be detected from no more than about two miles away , they could be hard to hear if they 're on the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean			0
layers of different water temperatures could also make it tough to pick up the sound of the beacons , experts say			0
live : latest updates on the missing @entity31 jetliner what can we tell from fresh lead ? if this is the debris of @entity2 , what happens next ? difficulties may hamper flight 370 search opinion : search for @entity2 highlights need for trust , unity in @entity323 @entity0 's @entity324 contributed to this report .			1

new : six planes continue search in remote @entity6
so far no sign of objects seen by satellite
what was up with pilot 's call , and were batteries aboard the plane dangerous ?
@entity10 officials have said the objects could be from @entity2
