@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you are a young person living in @entity5 right now , it can be pretty confusing knowing what to believe : is it a hopeful place or is it trapped in a vicious cycle ? is it the site of the world 's fastest growing economies , or is it a place where more than 200 schoolgirls are kidnapped and held captive for two weeks with no hope of recovery ? on the one hand , much more than half of the employable young population is out of a job and there are many caught in wars and rumors of wars , from @entity26 's two sides to the @entity27			1
but on the other , there 's growth and palpable excitement : @entity5 is the continent to watch ; investment is pouring in for technology and a whole range of businesses both new and traditional , many countries boast impressive @entity36 ; democracy is solidifying , and with it free speech and citizen engagement , a flourishing sense of enterprise and a groundswell of creativity			2
there is no greater symbol of this confusion than @entity1 at this exact moment			2
on the one hand , we are the focus of the world , with our gdp rebased and our economy enjoying something of a rebirth ; and yet on the other , we are the focus of the world , with bombs tearing through our nation 's capital , and girls abducted in broad daylight by domestic terrorists			0
with the @entity64 coming to @entity65 this week , i see myself frenziedly planning alongside other @entity66 across @entity0 , @entity65 and @entity67 to welcome the world to our country and to show its vast potential , looking forward to the sessions and the panels focused on inclusive growth and job creation			1
at the same time i sit on the board of @entity77 is enough @entity1 , which is passionately , angrily demanding that the world cancels the @entity64 on @entity5 to send a message to our lethargic president that he must find the 234 girls who have been missing for 18 days , and stop the violence that has taken the lives of over 1,500 in the north of @entity1 this year			1
how can i be excited about going to @entity65 next week for the @entity64 when a bomb just went off in the city 's center ? should i tweet # @entity88 , or # @entity89 ? talk about schizophrenia			1
i find myself confused , pulled in both directions			0
yet i find both imperatives compelling , almost inevitable			0
i believe this is the most urgent challenge for young people like me , growing up in a time of great flux			0
the world has so much faith in young @entity5 at the moment -- and with good reason ; see what we 've done with technology , the creative industries and civil society , for instance -- urging and willing us to fulfill the promise that is in abundance amongst us , to become the " turning point generation			0
" but if only the world understood how frustrating it can be to have hope in the future of @entity1 when its power sector remains comatose , corrupt ministers collude with the legislature , people die in stadiums while jostling for jobs , and governments strangle small businesses with multiple taxation and out - of - touch policies			1
we have the important duty to maintain hope , keep up the excitement ; channel the energy and take advantage of the opportunities that exist around us			1
but at the same time , we must maintain perspective , and avoid burying our heads in the sand ; we must demand better governance and speak with clarity and integrity about the failings of our leaders in government and the private sector			2
our eyes must be fixed on the stars , but our feet must stand firmly on the ground			1
it is a delicate balance , but we have no choice			0
we must play the hand our continent has dealt us			0
we have no choice .			0
