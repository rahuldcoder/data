-- @entity1 came to a standstill when a gunman killed a soldier outside a war memorial in @entity6 -- then stormed into parliament , sending lawmakers hiding behind barricaded doors			1
the incident has raised a concern : how secure is the nation 's seat of power			1
a patchwork of jurisdictions unlike in the @entity18 where the @entity20 police is responsible for security at the @entity20 , four different agencies are charged with ensuring the safety of various parts of the parliament building in @entity1			1
the @entity25 -- the national police force -- covers the parliament grounds while a @entity29 security detail is in charge of buildings under the @entity29 jurisdiction			2
a @entity34 security detail is responsible for one area of the building while the @entity37 keeps an eye on the surrounding streets			2
this could make communication a major challenge			0
two years ago , @entity1 's auditor general issued a report recommending a unified security force			1
it was n't acted upon			0
communication breakdown ? authorities investigating wednesday 's attack will likely look at why the security agencies at the parliament did not tighten security after @entity6 police received a 911 call at nearby @entity55			2
it is there that @entity58 killed @entity59 , a reservist guarding a tomb for the country 's fallen , injured two others and then headed for the parliament			2
@entity64 , a former deputy prime minister , said it 's too early to make conclusions on whether there was a communication breakdown			0
" in order to assess whether there was a failure of the security or whether it was inadequate , we need to know more about what happened , " @entity64 told the @entity70 newspaper			0
" but if this is linked to religious extremism , we 've significantly changed the security game in @entity1			1
" easy access visitors have to go through metal detectors , but once they go through one set , they have easy access to most parliamentary offices			0
it 's unclear how the gunman got past the metal detectors and into the building			1
" somebody who decides that they want to rush the building can walk up ... and then rush into the building before anybody can really effectively do anything , " lawmaker @entity90 told @entity0 partner network @entity91			0
he would like to see the security checkpoints moved to the " edges of the parliamentary precinct , so that when people enter onto the grounds itself , they 've already been screened			0
" intensified security in the past two decades , @entity1 has intensified security in government buildings after a man drove a bus into @entity110 in 1989			1
in 2009 , environmental protesters made it to the top of two buildings			0
each incidents led to calls for more security restrictions			0
a delicate balance still , lawmakers are loathe to see draconian measures imposed that will limit public access in favor of greater security			1
" i just think what 's really important to remember from this is that @entity110 is an incredible public place that 's open for people to play football and come and protest and sit and have their lunches , do their yoga , " @entity125 told @entity91 .			2

the nation 's seat of power has various layers of security jurisdictions
@entity1 is *grappling* with finding a balance between security and public access to the building
in the past two decades , it has intensified security in government buildings
