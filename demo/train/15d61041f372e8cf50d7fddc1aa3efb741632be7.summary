i need to continue to breathe art , the air that is in @entity0 , to walk in my city , to walk in my streets			1

" it 's something so special			0
@entity2 : do you think that the architecture , the surroundings , inspire you ? @entity4 : sure , because to live in @entity0 means to breathe art and my collection , my fashion , why it 's so unusual , so colorful			1
my dream , maybe because of my family of course , was to be a painter			0
i chose in one moment the direction of textiles ; from textiles i went to fashion ; but for me , i make one fashion show , it is like making one art exhibition			1
i would like the people that buy my clothes to understand that for me it 's one small piece of art. @entity2 : have you seen @entity0 change since you were young ? @entity4 : everything has changed , all over the world			1
i believe @entity0 has changed less than many other cities because we are more conservative , we try to keep everything that is fantastic , everything that is unbelievable , in @entity0			1
in the next 1000 years we need to take care about the beauty and the fantastic things that are in @entity0			1
@entity2 : what are your favorite colors ? @entity4 : it depends on my mood			1
sometimes it depends on where i am , sometimes i adore and love red , sometimes the yellow when i am in the country because the yellow that is with the green and around me i say , " @entity127 !

i like to appreciate how nature is born again			0
see @entity4 's @entity168 farmhouse @entity2 : where else do you like to go ? @entity4 : i am a helicopter pilot			1
something that gives me pleasure sometimes is taking my helicopter to go high , 2000 meter , 6000 feet , to go there and feel like a bird			2
in this moment i feel free			2
i feel in this world and life we 've lost our freedom , maybe because we are too confused about the politics , maybe confused about the television that washes your brain			0
i love to be there flying			2
to feel that in the moment i move my clutch i feel like i move my wings			0

@entity0 is beautiful like it is			1

@entity2 : you 're famous for having collections that celebrate women			2

i love to speak about feminism : i love to speak about a woman with a lot of personality			0
a woman that loves to show you how intelligent she is			0
maybe i am the only man in the world who says the woman is stronger than the man , the woman has more personality in the world than the man , because the woman is my muse			0
i do n't have one muse			0
all the women are my muse			0
