-- after just two days of closed - door negotiations , the leaders who had gathered at the @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , announced no agreement was reached on the @entity2 chair 's proposal to improve whale conservation			1
@entity10 did not support the proposal , but we had hoped governments would change it to become an agreement to end whaling , not a recipe for continuing it			2
it is particularly disappointing to me , because my professional commitment to end the whale hunt in my country of @entity24 -- which led to the exposure of an embezzlement scandal at the heart of the whaling industry -- has come at significant personal cost			1
the investigation i conducted with my colleague , @entity31 , led to our arrests in front of banks of media outlets who had been told about it in advance			1
the homes of @entity10 office and staff members were raided			0
seventy - five police officers were deployed to handcuff two peaceful activists			0
we were held without charge for 23 days ; questioned for up to 10 hours a day while tied to chairs and without a lawyer present			1
we are now out on bail awaiting verdict and sentencing , expected in early september			0
if i can risk my future to bring the fraudulent @entity56 hunt to an end , if whaling whistle - blowers are prepared to risk their lives to expose the corruption , how can it be that the @entity2 has yet again failed to take the political risk to pressure my government to end the scientific whaling sham ? since the @entity2 's moratorium on commercial whaling came into force in 1986 , @entity24 has continued to hunt whales under the guise of " scientific research , " making a mockery of the moratorium			1
by claiming that slaughtering thousands of whales , in waters designated a whale sanctuary no less , is a scientific experiment needed to understand whales , @entity24 has violated the spirit and intention of the moratorium as well as the @entity75			1
@entity76 and @entity77 have simply ignored the moratorium			1
those two nations , together with @entity24 , have killed more than 30,000 whales since then			1
i have always opposed my country 's hunt , which is why i decided to join @entity10			0
while it may be an emotionally charged political issue outside @entity24 , domestically it barely causes a political ripple			2
in 2006 , @entity10 decided to focus the bulk of its anti-whaling campaign in @entity24 to bring the issue home			2
wholly funded by @entity56 taxpayers , the whaling program has produced no peer - reviewed scientific research and has been repeatedly told by the @entity2 that the so - called research is not needed or wanted			1
all it has produced is a massive bill for the taxpayers and tons of surplus whale meat that the @entity56 public does not want to eat			0
it has also produced endless rumors and allegations of corruption and mismanagement			0
two years ago , following a tip from three former whalers turned whistle - blowers , my colleagues at @entity24 and i began a public interest investigation and discovered that indeed , corruption runs deep			1
all three whalers claimed that whale meat was routinely embezzled , with the full knowledge of government and whaling fleet operator officials			0
@entity10 eventually intercepted one of nearly 100 suspicious boxes coming off the ships			0
although its contents were labeled as cardboard , 23.5 kilograms of prime whale meat were inside , destined for a private address			0
on may 15 , 2008 , we handed over the box to the authorities , with additional evidence of the crime			0
initially the @entity127 district prosecutor began to investigate			0
but we were eventually charged with trespass and theft of the whale meat , valued at nearly 60,000 yen ( about $ 550 at the time )			0
we face from 18 months up to 10 years in jail for exposing the truth behind an industry that is financially , morally and scientifically bankrupt			2
the @entity136 's @entity135 on @entity137 has ruled that our human rights have been breached and the prosecution is politically motivated			0
the @entity140 has expressed her concern about our case			0
@entity144 , @entity145 , two @entity147 laureates , countless international legal experts , politicians and more than half a million individuals have raised their voices in opposition to the prosecution			0
we will be tried and sentenced in september , more than two years after we first exposed the corruption			0
but the scandal does not end there			0
just last week , more allegations emerged that @entity24 engages in vote - buying and bribery to keep its whaling fleet in the water			1
and yet , the @entity2 continues to close its doors and ears to the reality of @entity24 's commercial whaling			1
i came to @entity4 in the hope that this , the @entity167 , could mean an end to all commercial whaling , but i leave knowing that governments are only interested in taking strong public positions on whales but not in taking action to save them , not even behind closed doors			2
@entity177 and @entity31 's political prosecution is a clear sign that @entity24 has no intention of easily letting go of its debt - ridden whaling program			1
there are too many vested interests inside the government			0
what is more disappointing is that those vested interests have gone unchallenged by the @entity2 , the body set up to conserve whales			1
it may be surprising that in this day and age , and given the huge public interest in the issue , conversations about saving whales are held in secret			2
but the truth is that @entity24 's whaling program relies on secrecy and corruption to stay afloat			1
after two years of negotiations , this year 's meeting could have been an opportunity for the @entity2 to actually move forward and end the status quo			2
but its collective failure means that 24 years after the establishment of the moratorium on commercial whaling , @entity24 , @entity76 and @entity77 will continue again to hunt whales with impunity			1
i challenge the commission to throw open its doors and shine a spotlight on the corruption that is so evident , investigate all the allegations affecting the @entity2 that have been laid clearly before it on numerous occasions and realize that it is not only @entity24 's international reputation that has been tainted by the failure in @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity223 , colleague face charges after finding corruption in @entity24 's whaling industry
@entity223 : he and @entity31 were held , questioned , often taped to chairs , for 23 days
@entity223 says @entity24 uses guise of " scientific research " to slaughter whales
@entity223 : as @entity2 does nothing , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity24 kill 30,000 whales
