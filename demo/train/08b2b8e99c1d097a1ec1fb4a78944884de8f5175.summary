@entity1 , @entity0 -- relatives of a former @entity4 jailed in @entity5 for allegedly spying for the @entity6 say they are pleading with the leaders of the @entity8 to show mercy and set @entity10 free			1
" i just want to ask president ( @entity15 ) @entity14 and the supreme leader @entity16 , these two are our only hope			0
these two can bring @entity10 home , " pleaded @entity18 , @entity10 's mother			1
" we just want ( him ) to come home , i think one year is enough			0
if you want to punish us , if you want to punish @entity10 , for whatever reason he is there , just one year is enough			2
please let him come home , " his mother added			2
with reluctance and much apprehension , the @entity10 family opened their home to @entity2 and sat down for an exclusive interview , their first since @entity10 was arrested on august 29 , 2011			1
" the struggle is the lack of communication , " said @entity33 , @entity10 's sister , " going from talking to someone daily , weekly , and visiting on holidays to absolutely nothing and not knowing what 's going on			1
" @entity10 , 29 , was born in @entity41 , and was raised in @entity42 and @entity0			2
his family described him as an all - american guy with a yearning to travel and a love of languages			0
they said he is an outgoing , athletic individual who joined the military to help his family financially and a man who is proud of his service in @entity52			0
mother of accused @entity55 spy says @entity5 charges are false his family says he wanted to learn more about his culture and heritage			1
this was his first trip to @entity5 and he was looking forward to visiting with relatives , especially the maternal grandmother who helped raise him			2
but after two weeks in @entity5 , @entity10 was arrested , and his family says he was not charged with anything for months			1
but in december of last year @entity10 's parents say they were shocked to see a video broadcast on @entity5 tv showing their son confessing to espionage			1
in the edited and highly produced video , @entity10 utters his name in @entity72 speaks in @entity73 describing his work as a @entity4 and seeming to confirm the allegations of the @entity5 government that he was an @entity5 - @entity55 working as a @entity6 agent			1
" they forced him to do that			0
that 's not true , " said @entity10 's mother , referring to the alleged confession			1
" they knew he was a military ( soldier ) because he told the @entity90 he was in the military , " she adds , explaining that her son checked with @entity5 authorities in the @entity55 before making the trip			2
" he 's not a spy , he 's not working for the @entity6 , we know that , we are sure , absolutely , " @entity18 said			0
the @entity94 also denies @entity10 was spying for the @entity55 government and calls this case a gross miscarriage of justice			2
" we never thought he should have been arrested			0
we 've been trying , because he 's a dual @entity55 - @entity5 national , we 've been trying to get access to him since he was originally locked up , " said @entity94 spokesperson @entity99			2
" the @entity5 have never allowed us to go to see him			2
" @entity10 's mother has traveled to @entity5 three times and has been granted limited visits			1
she described her son as disheartened and completely confused as to why he was arrested			0
" he is skinny , pale , like a chalk , his face was like chalk			0
hair was shaved , had a beard , he walked like this and the feet was together he walked like a robot , " she said			0
" he could n't stop crying and he was ( saying ) ' i do n't know why i 'm here , ' @entity113			0
" the @entity114 say their son now has a government - approved lawyer in @entity5 although contact with him has been sporadic			0
a lower court in @entity5 sentenced @entity10 to death in january , but the nation 's @entity121 annulled that sentence less than two months later and ordered a retrial			1
the lower court previously had convicted @entity10 of " working for an enemy country , " as well as membership in the @entity6			0
the @entity127 now believe their son will be granted a retrial , but no date has been set and the family says they have very little information about the legal process			0
for @entity10 's twin sister , @entity135 , the worry and the waiting have been all too overwhelming			1
she read from a card he wrote her on their joint birthday last year , before he went to @entity5 : " ' ( @entity144 ) ime has passed but one thing has n't changed and that 's the bond i share with my twin sister			1
i will never be alone no matter where i am			0
' " at night i just think about him ; i feel so helpless			2
i feel like i ca n't do anything			0
just please , bring him home , " she pleaded , hoping @entity5 leaders will hear her			1
@entity152 , @entity10 's father , said he believes the best chance they have of bringing @entity10 home soon is appealing to the @entity5 leaders directly			1
" it 's going to take some cooperation from @entity5 leaders , " he said			1
" the leadership needs to show some leniency and some cooperation in helping out a crying mother and sister and a father who loves his son dearly			0
" i miss @entity10 very much , " he said			0
can @entity5 and @entity55 be friends ? @entity2 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			1
