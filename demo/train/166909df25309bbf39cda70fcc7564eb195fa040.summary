-- in the last few months @entity1 have found themselves in a cyber no - man 's land			1
many are reporting international websites and online services , including @entity6 and @entity7 , are often blocked and circumvention tools effectively squashed , making it difficult to communicate with anyone outside the country			1
national websites are still easily accessed , but as internet speeds slow to a crawl , many of the country 's netizens are finding access to even the most rudimentary urls barred -- including those belonging to banks and local businesses			1
with the country 's presidential election less than two weeks away , many experts find the timing of the latest apparent restrictions significant			1
" every time you get close to an important event , like the election , the internet goes down , " says @entity27 , co-director of @entity29 - based organization @entity28 , which provides tools for @entity1 to circumvent government filters			1
@entity37 explains @entity1 elections before the 2009 elections , he notes , the regime appeared to focus mainly on censoring foreign news and social media sites			2
@entity1 easily bypassed these controls using @entity45 software , which makes it look like users are accessing sites from a separate country			1
lately , he says , it seems the government has become more sophisticated with its filters			2
since march , vpns have been blocked , making it harder for @entity1 to access foreign urls			1
in addition , encrypted international websites , such as @entity58 and any site with " https " in front of its address , have been made so painstakingly slow that they are virtually unusable			2
the idea , says @entity27 , is to push users to adopt the higher - speed national internet network , which some have dubbed the " halal internet " -- halal meaning permissible under @entity72 law			0
it acts essentially as a giant intranet allowing the authorities more power to monitor web activity and restrict access to websites			0
lately @entity80 has been awash with grievances from @entity1 who bemoan the various implications of the new blocks			2
some have complained of increased workloads , friction with employers and general impositions to their everyday professional lives			0
those that have managed to access the site ( much fewer of late , says @entity27 ) frequently use it as an outlet to share circumvention tips , and vent their frustration			0
tweets are often punctuated with # filternet -- the nickname many have given to the state 's cyber blocks			2

" keep in mind that i 'm an expert , and can usually find a workaround			0
i 'd imagine it 's a much bigger number for others , " he says			0
he adds that the apparent state blocks have put a strain on his company 's relationship with clients , as stalled access to email has made it difficult to keep up a timely communication			1
" we 're a software company , so we really rely on the internet			2
these restrictions have made our clients very unhappy			0
we have n't lost one yet , but who knows ? " according to @entity103 , the filters are not as sophisticated as they could be and even the most rudimentary local sites -- such as those related to banks -- occasionally find themselves blocked			0
" our company uses internet banking services , and the finance department has had difficulty paying staff , " he says			2
@entity140 , an @entity141 researcher who has been mapping the emergence of @entity1 's national network , notes that often , those affected are n't necessarily anti-regime			1
" what you see in social media is frustration and desperation , " says @entity140			0
" people are saying , ' look , i 'm not political			0
i 'm just a student trying to submit my @entity152 thesis to my professor , and i ca n't , because my @entity6 does n't work '			0
there 's a real human toll that 's hard to asses based on economics			0
" read more : @entity1 's cartoonist find new lines of expression according to @entity27 , since 2009 , @entity161 have been required to report " forbidden " content to the authorities under the @entity164			1
in addition , accessing blocked sites was criminalized , so that any @entity1 reading or disseminating material the government deems inflammatory could face penalties			1
@entity140 notes there has been a considerable rise in malware and phishing attempts directed at anyone deemed anti-regime , and while he can not prove it , he suspects the @entity1 authorities are the ones responsible			1
he recalls receiving an email that tried to lure him into divulging his @entity6 username and password			0
" i set up a fake account to see what would happen , and within 24 hours , someone tried to log in and download all my emails , then sent out an email to my contacts trying to trick them into downloading the malware , " he says			0
the purpose , he suspects , is to give authorities information			0
@entity0 reached out to the @entity1 authorities to comment on the claimed use of malware , internet blocks and phishing attacks but received no reply			1
last week the @entity141 @entity196 said that it will allow the export to @entity1 of " certain services , software and hardware incident to personal communication in @entity1			1
" " as the @entity1 government attempts to silence its people by cutting off their communication with each other and the rest of the world , the @entity141 will continue to take action to help the @entity1 people exercise their universal human rights , including the right to freedom of expression , " it was announced in a press statement on may 31			1
@entity140 is n't optimistic the filters will lift , as they 've done in the past			0
" you might see a slight relaxation of controls after the elections are over -- some of the throttling , which is really distressful , might let up -- but the sites that are blocked will remain blocked			2
now that the state sees it can get away with it , these filters are here to stay			0

in the lead up to @entity1 's election , the state has made the internet nearly unusable for many of its **citizens**
usually @entity1 use vpn software to bypass government controls , but lately , these too have been blocked
some fear the government is *unleashing* malware and phishing software to *spy* on @entity1 **citizens**
@entity141 government announced it will allow export of services to allow @entity1 people greater freedom on communication
