-- @entity1 took line honors in the @entity4 @entity3 to @entity6 classic wednesday but faces an anxious wait to have the victory confirmed after an official protest by the race committee			1
@entity12 's super maxi crossed the finish line in the @entity15 capital with a three minutes seven second advantage over five - time winner @entity17 , one of the closest finishes in the race 's history			1
but the moment of glory at @entity25 was short - lived as a representative of the committee immediately notified him of the protest			1

" this is assessed to breach ( rule ) 41 by soliciting help from an outside source , " read a statement on the official race website			1
the protest hearing will be held by the @entity49 at the @entity50 at 10.00 local time thursday			1

there is an @entity31 chopper pilot that is a nominated witness			0
" i am very sorry about this event , i can assure you			0
unfortunately , that has stopped our celebration here , as the result comes provisional until the protest is heard tomorrow , " he said			2
@entity54 went on to pay tribute to @entity1 for their " magnificent sailing " in this race and also @entity17 skipper @entity12 claimed the conversation with the tv crew had just been " a question of are they alright and have they lost any mainsails " following rough conditions on the first night which saw a number of boats retire			1
" we respect the fact that there 's laws in racing ... and we will of course go in and oblige that , and we 're confident that the outcome will confirm our ( win ) , " @entity12 told gathered reporters			0

@entity1 took the lead for the first time on tuesday night after the pair had broken away from the rest of the 88 - strong fleet from the start in @entity132 on @entity133			1
light winds and the traditional difficult run to the finish on the @entity137 left the outcome in doubt to the very end , even before the protest			2
