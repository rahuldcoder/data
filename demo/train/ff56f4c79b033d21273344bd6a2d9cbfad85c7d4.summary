@entity0 , @entity1 -- the scene of sheer devastation left by powerful tsunami waves looked sadly familiar : trucks slammed into houses , uprooted trees and downed power lines soaked in muddy water , while time stood still inside abandoned homes with unmade beds and scattered stuffed toys			1
it was the eerie combination of sounds that stood out as i surveyed a deserted village on this chilly wednesday morning : rustling of dangling tin sheets in gusty wind , my own breathing behind a face mask and the constant beeping of my @entity25 counter			2
my colleagues and i had just entered the 20 - kilometer exclusion zone , a radius @entity1 authorities drew around the @entity30 power plant and ordered some 78,000 residents evacuated in the early days of the crisis , now the worst nuclear accident since @entity34			1
the march 11 twin disasters of a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and the ensuing tsunami in northeastern @entity1 have resulted in the plant belching radioactive particles into the surrounding environment			1
driving for two hours on winding highways from the @entity30 train station , we had passed through rural @entity1 's alternating scenes of snow - covered mountains and green valleys in full bloom -- until we reached a checkpoint with a big " no - entry " sign and flashing red lights			1
a friendly police officer , however , waved us through , after emphasizing the need to don face masks despite the relatively low reading on radiation			2
our shoes tightly wrapped in paper booties , we finally stepped onto the soil inside the so - called hot zone , some 18 kilometers north of the stricken nuclear plant			1
with parts of the ground still wet from days of rain , we avoided murky puddles to minimize the risk of cross-contamination			2
the numbers on our @entity25 counters fluctuated while the alarms -- with base level set low -- kept going off			2
still , we faced no danger of being exposed to anything that would harm human health			0
cars zipped by occasionally as residents were allowed in to check on homes and businesses , but the only other sign of life appeared to be farm animals -- a few cows , horses and chickens -- left behind that have grown gaunt			0
we noticed a lone young man in a blue jacket and jeans standing by a large pool of muddy water			0
declining to reveal his name , the 34 - year - old farmer told us , before the tsunami hit , the pool was a fertile rice field that his family had tilled for 150 years			1
" i have lost my work and my home , " he said , adding he had come back to retrieve some personal belongings			0
" and i am scared about my health			0
" he said he does n't trust government officials who say risks from radiation are low for local residents			0
his father wants to return , but he has other plans for the future			0
" i may have to face the prospect of leaving my father behind and live faraway from here to start a family , " he said			0
we wished the young farmer good luck and did n't linger long inside the exclusion zone as it started drizzling from the gloomy sky			1
as we exited the checkpoint , a news headline flashed on my phone : " @entity1 to enforce nuclear evacuation zone			1
" after removing face masks and paper booties , we drove past a line of shuttered storefronts and stopped at the centuries - old @entity127 temple just outside the 20 - kilometer perimeter			1
sweeping its immaculately kept ground -- complete with a sand garden and a fish pond -- was @entity133 , a 58 - year - old @entity134 monk who offers a rare sanctuary to a community ravaged by a succession of disasters			1
the government had advised residents between the 20 - and 30 - kilometer zones to move away or remain indoors			1
" religion is not something distant , it stays next to you , " @entity133 explained his decision to stay after seeing hundreds of bodies of tsunami victims cremated at the local funeral home without a proper @entity134 ritual			2
" i hope people understand that death is not the end of one 's life , but a revolving step where lives meet again			0
" lighting a candle in the temple 's main hall where eight boxes of cremated remains lay on a table , @entity133 chanted prayers for the dead			0
but it 's the tough and cheerful nature of the locals , he said , that has given him the best hope even as the nuclear fallout continues to unfold			2
" we will rebuild , " he said			0
" i 'm confident about that because we had done the same after the second world war			0
