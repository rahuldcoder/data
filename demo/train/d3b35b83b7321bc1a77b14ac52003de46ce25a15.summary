@entity7 : you voted him best director in our @entity12 poll walking away with 15 percent of your votes , @entity7 's hard - hitting documentary style , quickfire editing , fondness for @entity21 backdrops and rapport with @entity23 make him your top director			1
born on november 17 , 1942 , as a child @entity7 struggled with his health			1
the movies -- along with the church -- became a haven for him			2
" when i was a kid i had terrible asthma -- i did n't go out at all , " he told @entity0 at a masterclass at the 2007 @entity35			0
" i was out on the streets , yes , but i was not athletic in any way and so the movie theatre was a refuge			0
" his love for the silver screen led him to devote his free time to watching movies wherever he could -- at the cinema and on tv at home			0
" i do n't think i was ever happier than when i was alone in our 2 , 3 - room tenement apartment on @entity49 , " he recalls			0
" my mother and father were at work , my brother was at work			0
i would come home from school in the afternoon and on television would be ' @entity58 ' by @entity59 , ' @entity60 ' by @entity61 , @entity62 ... i would be doing little drawings of them like my own movies			0
and i never stopped doing that			0
" even so , @entity7 almost did n't make it into the movies			1
born into the devoutly religious @entity70 community of @entity71 on @entity21 's @entity72 and a devout @entity70 , he studied for the priesthood , almost joining the seminary before his passion for filmmaking took his talents elsewhere			2
" the ritual of the @entity79 is important to me			0
i found it fascinating ; i found it moving ; i still find it fascinating , " he said			0
he entered @entity83 in 1960 as an undergraduate , where he was taught to make films about what he knew -- his own life			2
he was also very influenced by the cinema verit√© movement and the fly - on - the - wall documentary style that was just beginning to emerge at the time			0
this influence would show up again and again in his student films , and later in " @entity9 , " " @entity8 " and " @entity94			1
" despite coming from a poor background and not having access to 8mm cameras like many of his university peers , @entity7 dove into film with a passion and was soon a star pupil			1
head and shoulders above his classmates , he won every award and scholarship going			2
when @entity7 ( known to his friends as @entity7 ) @entity7 arrived in @entity109 in 1971 he was an unknown			1
he hung out with other young actors and directors , among them @entity113 and @entity114 , all hustling for their big break			0
@entity7 had made films before , notably a no - budget effort , " who 's that knocking at my door ? " with a young @entity120			1
but it was with " @entity94 " that @entity7 got his big break			1
" @entity8 " followed three years later , while 1980 's " @entity9 " probably saw @entity23 's finest performance under @entity7			1
iconic and violent , 1990 's " @entity124 " featured top - drawer performances from @entity7 favorites , @entity23 , @entity127 and @entity128 , while " casino " ( 1995 ) drew heavily on its predecessor , with a good measure of extra violence and an @entity134 - nominated performance from @entity135			1
more recently , " @entity140 " paired @entity7 with @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139			1
but it was 2006 's " @entity10 , " a remake of @entity144 film " @entity143 " starring @entity137 alongside @entity145 and @entity146 , that broke the @entity134 drought for @entity7 , at last winning him his gold statuette			1
when @entity0 asked him at the 2007 @entity149 what makes a great director , @entity7 said that it is something he finds hard to pin down			1
" it 's very hard to make these value judgments , " he said			2
" i think one key element in good and great is to have something to say , a voice			0
" but he added that skill in telling a visual story plays a large part			0
" there are directors , filmmakers who simply ( and it 's not simple at all ) know how to put things in the frame , " he explained			2
" they know how to keep a story going , fast and in such a way that and make it entertaining			0
it may not say much but there 's a technical skill that 's overwhelmingly difficult to master			2
" that 's a skill @entity7 has by the bucketload -- and one he revels in			1
" the designing of the shots is something that i enjoy a lot , " he told @entity0 at @entity175			0
" it 's the biggest challenge ... when i design and edit a sequence , when i know a shot is going to go from shot a to b to @entity184 and then i 'll intercut shot c with b and @entity187 -- i get very excited about that , " he revealed			2
but his favorite part of filming remains the editing process			0
" @entity192 takes me back to being alone and drawing pictures , " he explained			0
but his love for the edit suite caused friction early on in his career			0
" i had to live in @entity109 between 1970 and 1981 in order to get to make film and be introduced to the people who allowed me to make films , " he revealed , " but i found that i had difficulty sometimes with the way some excellent editors resented the director in the editing room			2
" @entity7 is famous for his partnerships with leading actors , most notably @entity23 and , more recently , @entity137			1
shunned by the @entity210 for years , @entity7 finally snapped up his elusive best director @entity134 for " @entity10 " in 2006			1
following his 2005 rockumentary on @entity213 , he has just completed " @entity214 , " a documentary following the career of the @entity217			0

@entity7 topped the @entity12 's " @entity13 " poll
his *lauded* films *include* " @entity94 , " " @entity8 , " " @entity124 "
