@entity1 , @entity0 -- bowing to eight days of protests , @entity0 president @entity3 said tuesday he will not seek office again in elections scheduled for september , but vowed to stay in the country and finish his term			1
the concession , the largest the embattled president has made so far , was remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades			2
but it was unclear whether the offer would do anything to calm opposition groups and protesters who have called for @entity21 's immediate resignation			1
" my first responsibility now is to restore the stability and security of the homeland , to achieve a peaceful transition of power in an environment that will protect @entity0 and @entity0 and which will allow for the responsibility to be given to whoever the people elect in the forthcoming elections , " @entity3 said in a televised address tuesday night			1
the announcement rang flat in @entity1 's @entity34 , where thousands of protesters erupted in chants of " down with @entity3 ! " and " the people want the president to be judged ! " following his announcement			1
some waved shoes in the air -- a deep insult in the @entity46 world -- and said they would continue their demonstrations until @entity3 quits outright			1
@entity48 , the @entity49 winner who has become a leading opposition figure , said @entity3 's decision was " an act of deception " that would only " extend the agony			1
" " whoever gave him that advice gave him absolutely the wrong advice , " @entity48 said			0
however , @entity61 secretary - general @entity60 , a former @entity0 foreign minister , said demonstrators should weigh what @entity3 has said before responding			1
" i 'm aware that there are certain currents in @entity0 that will not see that as satisfactory and they need more , " @entity60 , a possible presidential contender himself , told @entity2			2
but , he added , " i believe that there is something new that has been offered			0
" @entity3 has led @entity0 for nearly 30 years since the 1981 assassination of his predecessor , @entity73 , aided by an emergency decree that has allowed him to rule with an iron fist			1
but following demonstrations that have only grown in the past week , the 82 - year - old former air force general told his people tuesday night , " i have spent enough time serving @entity0			2
" i will pursue the transfer of power in a way that will fulfill the people 's demands , and that this new government will fulfill the people 's demands and their hopes for political , economic and social progress , " he said			2
tuesday 's turnout in @entity1 , @entity91 and other cities came despite efforts by the government to suspend rail service and cut off mobile phone and internet networks , and in spite of the mounting hardships facing @entity0			1
banks and schools have been shuttered during the demonstrations , teller machine screens are dark and gas stations have run out of fuel			0
long lines snaked around bakeries and supermarkets as shops began to ration how much food customers could buy			0
in @entity91 , protesters clashed with supporters of @entity3 , leaving 12 people injured , said @entity114 , a member of an opposition group			1
the military was called in to restore calm			0
@entity118 , a protester , said he was hit in the head by a stick during the clash			2
" we do n't want him ( @entity3 )			2
we are staying here until we die , " he said			0
@entity3 's announcement capped a day in which anti-government demonstrators stood shoulder - to - shoulder in @entity34 for a " march of millions			1
" it comes less than three weeks after a wave of protests that forced @entity133 's longtime strongman to flee to @entity134 in mid-january			2
protesters last week taunted , " @entity3 , @entity134 is waiting for you			1
" but despite calls for him to leave the country , the aging leader vowed tuesday that " this dear country is my country ... and i will die on its land			0
" opposition leader @entity142 called the speech " very depressing			1
" @entity142 said @entity3 was already expected to step down at the end of his term -- but he is believed to be maneuvering to have his son , @entity146 , succeed him			2
" he did not at any point in his speech reject the possibility that his son could run for president , " said @entity142 , who spent three years in prison after challenging @entity3 in @entity0 's first multiparty presidential election in 2005			1
he said the protesters in @entity34 " are angrier than ever " after the address			0
@entity158 , deputy chairman of the officially banned @entity159 , said @entity3 's speech was built around emotional appeals to his decades of military service and the presidency			1
" after 30 years during which corruption and diminishing the strategic role of @entity0 in the region became the norm , i do not feel it is time to appeal for people 's emotion , " @entity158 said			1
" we should say ' thank you ' to him , ' and get out			0
' " in @entity174 , president @entity173 said he spoke with @entity3 soon after he announced he would not seek re-election			1
@entity173 called for an orderly transition in @entity0 that , he said , should be meaningful , peaceful and must begin now			1
the @entity178 president stressed the @entity0 people will be the ones to determine their own leaders and destiny			1
in @entity1 , the @entity178 ambassador to @entity0 , @entity186 , met tuesday with @entity48 and will be speaking with leaders of other political movements , a senior @entity184 official said			2
the official cautioned that @entity186 's talks with @entity48 does n't mean the @entity178 favors him			0
as in @entity133 , the protests have been fueled by economic woes , including a dramatic rise in the cost of living coupled with high unemployment			0
despite the government 's food subsidies , people are struggling , with an estimated 40 % of the country living in poverty			0
the majority of @entity0 's population -- and the vast majority of its unemployed -- is under 30 , and many protesters are young men looking for economic opportunities and a better life			1
as the demonstrations grew , @entity3 fired his cabinet and ordered newly appointed vice president @entity208 to hold talks on political reform with opposition leaders			1
and on monday , the military -- the foundation of the modern @entity0 state -- announced it would not open fire on peaceful protesters			1
" i think it 's all over with once the army makes that announcement , " said @entity217 , a @entity218 historian at the @entity219			0
@entity217 said he had expected the regime to endure the crisis with the support of the military , but that the military appears to have " cut @entity3 loose			2
" @entity226 , a @entity227 professor and @entity229 analyst , said the military may have anchored the government but , " at some point , they are going to have to make a decision about protecting the institution beyond the man			0
" and @entity236 , a @entity237 professor and @entity239 analyst , said @entity3 's invocation of his years of service was " almost pathetic			1
" " i believe the crowd was discovering its power as @entity3 was discovering his own weakness and the vulnerability of his own regime , " @entity236 said			2
now , " no one believes his promises , and now no one really believes his threats			0
" the demonstrations had turned ugly last friday , when thousands of riot and plainclothes police used brutal force to crack down on people on the streets			0
unconfirmed reports suggest up to 300 people may have been killed during the protests , @entity262 @entity261 said tuesday			0
@entity263 has reported 80 deaths from two hospitals in @entity1 , 36 in @entity91 and 13 in @entity266			2
@entity2 has not been able to independently confirm the death toll			0
but since the weekend , the army has replaced police as the enforcers of security , and the gatherings have been largely peaceful			0
in recent days , protests inspired by the @entity133 outcome have spread to @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278			0
calls for political reform prompted @entity277 's @entity281 tuesday to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister , and a @entity285 page urged similar demonstrations in @entity287			0
@entity288 , director of @entity218 studies at @entity291 's @entity290 , said the @entity46 world is facing a " wave " of unrest sparked by the @entity133 revolt			0
" if it were not for @entity133 , none of this would be happening at this time or in this way , " @entity288 said			0
@entity2 's @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 and journalist @entity310 contributed to this report			0
