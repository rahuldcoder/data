@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity1 , water flows uphill toward money and power			1
that 's a well - known maxim out here , especially in the @entity9 - ready @entity8 -- that forgotten stretch of @entity1 that grows 40 % of @entity12 fruits , nuts and other table foods			1
meet a few people and it 's easy to see why			1
there 's @entity18 , 56 , whose garden hose started spitting out sand , not water , about this time last year ; or @entity24 ± a , a 70 - year - old former farm worker who stores water in buckets in the back of a rusty yellow pickup truck because her well is busted and there 's no reliable public system for her to hook up to ; she uses that nonpotable water to wash dishes , take showers and " flush " the toilet ; or @entity37 , 48 , who , like many here , makes a distinction between " water , " which is the stuff that comes from her tap , and which is usually too polluted to drink , and " drinking water , " which is the stuff she buys in plastic bottles			1
" we 're in the @entity12			1
we should be able to turn on that water and drink out of it , " @entity37 told me , standing by her kitchen sink , which has a five - gallon water jug next to it for cooking			2
" we ca n't ... it 's discriminatory , racist			1
" this is the invisible @entity1 -- the " other @entity1			1
" a place of pickup trucks and pesticides			0
it 's the same @entity1 @entity59 chronicled in " @entity60 , " the epic book about " @entity62 " who left the @entity64 during the @entity9 and fled to farms here			1
some of them are still around			0
on tuesday , i went to the town of @entity69 ( nickname : " @entity71 " ) ; and the unincorporated town of @entity73			0
there , i met @entity75 , whose family came to this supposed promised land from @entity78 and @entity79 when the dust storms made life back there unbearable			0
and it 's the @entity1 that 's going to be the subject of my next project in the @entity86 series			1
i 'm fascinated by this forgotten valley and a major river , the @entity89 , that cuts through it			1
the advocacy group @entity91 recently named the @entity89 the " most endangered " river in the country			1
to figure out why , i 'm setting off on a three - week journey to try to kayak and walk along its path			1
i 'm doing so because i want to understand the river and the people who depend on it -- beyond the screaming headlines about drought - year @entity1 politics			1
i want to get to know this river , at a river 's pace , on a river 's terms			1
i started the journey on tuesday by going on a tour of the @entity8 with the @entity109 in @entity110 , @entity1			1
i did that because i wanted to understand how and why water matters to people here			0
i found out it 's everything			2
yet there 's not nearly enough to go around			2
those who do have water have to deal with pollution from nitrate , which is linked to blue baby syndrome , kidney disease and other maladies			0
some blame farmers for slurping up groundwater with virtually no regulatory oversight from the state			0
farm advocates say there 's not enough river water for them , in part because of regulations to protect rare fish			1
they say they 're pulling groundwater to survive , too			0
i 'm going to withhold judgment for now , but i plan to wade deeper into these and many other environmental and social issues on my trip down the @entity89			1
the adventure down the river starts for real on wednesday			1
i 'm going to hike up to the untouched headwaters , high in the @entity143			1
i 'm hoping to end beneath the @entity144 in early july			0
that 's assuming i do n't get lost or die of heat exhaustion			2
you can follow the journey on @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			0
or , to make it easier , there 's a page on @entity2 that will collect all that stuff for you			2
i 'll be using the hashtag # endangeredriver			0
i could ramble on about my plans , but you 'll get to hear all about them in the coming weeks			0
for now , let me leave you with this : water is such a deeply personal topic out here in @entity1 that @entity165 , the wife of the man whose hose started sputtering sand , told me she has two recurring dreams about it			1
both are about a river , but they 're slightly different			2
@entity173 : the water is clean and pure			0
someone is struggling to swim , but @entity18 is able to grab this anonymous person and pull him or her out to safety			0
@entity179 : the river is polluted , which makes it not unlike the water that comes out of her tap			2
she and her husband use a $ 900 water filter / robot ( it looks like a miniature version of @entity190 from @entity191 ) to remove the nitrates from the water that comes out of their sink			0
they both work on fruit orchards , picking crops in the 100 - degree heat , paid by the weight , and making about $ 26,000 , together , per year			0
in that second dream , again , the person in the river is drowning			2
she tries to help but ca n't			0
she wakes up to a life where she and her husband would have no water at home if it were n't for the generosity of @entity75 , their neighbor , who gives them water from his well			0
they 're all worried his well could go dry , too			0
there are potential fixes for all this , and state programs that are trying to bring safe water to more people in the @entity8 and elsewhere			0
but there 's just not enough water to go around			2
so water continues to flow uphill			0
and , if more 's not done , it 's looking like the future .			2

@entity232 is starting a project on @entity1 's @entity89 and watershed
