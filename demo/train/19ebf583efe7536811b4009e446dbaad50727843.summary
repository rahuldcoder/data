-- that the road from revolution to a new @entity3 is arduous and twisting comes as no surprise			1
but few expected that today , one month from presidential elections , @entity3 would be moving toward more repression and less accountability than under the deposed dictator @entity10			1
@entity3 's crackdown on human - rights organizations , the prosecution and sentencing of the comic actor @entity16 and the notorious imposition of @entity18 28 , which removes the basic rights of citizens to challenge anything about the upcoming presidential election , create a trifecta of repression			1
blood is being spilled on @entity27 's streets once again , with up to 20 dead and counting , plus scores wounded by thugs attacking protesters outside the @entity31			0
the @entity32 of @entity33 ( @entity34 ) is consolidating its power			0
with the leading human rights organizations -- @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , the @entity42 and the @entity43 -- facing prosecution , oversight of the elections will be minimal at best			0
the government is eroding the power of civil society to help build a truly democratic @entity3			2
clashes in @entity3 turn deadly and the @entity50 government is complicit in some of these changes for the worse			1
the @entity50 mistakenly believed that the " carrot " of granting @entity34 carte blanche -- waiving the human - rights condition to deliver $ 1.3 billion in military goods -- would more likely ensure cooperation than applying the " stick " of withholding military aid			1
after pocketing the military aid , the @entity3 government allowed @entity50 under indictment to leave the country			1
then it redoubled its persecution of the @entity3 working for human rights ngos , threatening them with the serious charge of espionage			2
so far , the assumption that once the @entity50 were airlifted out of @entity27 , the @entity3 employees left behind would be , in the words of @entity71 , head of @entity39 's @entity27 office , " forgotten by the international community , " has proved to be true			1
" this sends the wrong message -- that the @entity50 cares only about its own self - interest , " @entity71 said in a recent interview in @entity75			2
" this is about much more than me and my staff ; it is a fight for the future of civil society in @entity3			2
without civil society , how can you have a healthy transition to democracy ? " @entity71 's harrowing tales of being held in the " cage " in the courtroom in @entity27 for five hours , where she read @entity91 , and of being led out of the building through a cell full of inmates in a failed attempt to intimidate her indicate that the authorities have every intention of going through with the trial of the @entity3 staff members of the five human rights organizations			2
recently making the rounds in @entity75 , @entity71 met with universal concern about the fate she and 14 other defendants would face standing trial			0
no one wants the brave @entity108 , or her colleagues , to be martyrs , but neither their safety in @entity3 nor immunity from being scapegoated can be guaranteed			2
unless the @entity3 authorities can not be persuaded to drop the case , civil society in @entity3 will be dealt a serious blow			0
two years ago , president @entity116 uttered these words in @entity27 : " i do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things : the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed ; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice ; government that is transparent and does n't steal from the people ; the freedom to live as you choose			0
those are not just @entity50 ideas , they are human rights , and that is why we will support them everywhere			2
" now , a revolution and a tumultuous aftermath later , those words ring hollow , as the @entity50 policy of supporting military dictators in @entity3 continues unabated			1
@entity3 feel anxious that the presidential elections will be run under @entity18 28 , part of @entity34 's @entity145 of march 2011			0
accordingly , election results issued by the @entity147 are immutable			0
in other words , if a citizen observes and even captures on film , electoral fraud , he or she has no right to question the result			0
as @entity34 safeguards its power , hard - line islamists seek to control @entity3 's narrative , tightening the noose around the neck of the @entity3 people			1
the unthinkable occurred last month when @entity16 , @entity3 's most beloved actor , was convicted of " insulting @entity163 " with his films			0
since the @entity10 era , fundamentalists have targeted artists , but the @entity16 case sets a new standard for censorship			0
instead of dismissing the case , as was the custom with past " offending @entity163 " charges , the judge convicted @entity16 and sentenced him to three months in prison			0
@entity16 may win on appeal , but now all @entity3 filmmakers have been put on notice that they may be subjected to the nebulous charge of " offending @entity163			0
" add to that the scores who have been convicted for " crimes " of expression in films , books and blogs			0
@entity3 's voices , newly energized since the revolution , are steadily being silenced			0
where can ordinary @entity3 look for support ? the @entity50 should be their prime defender			1
with its unconditional support of @entity34 , however , the @entity50 has forfeited the trust and respect of the @entity3 people			1
it is not too late for the @entity50 to put the real yearning of the @entity3 people for dignity , justice , opportunity and democracy ahead of the false stability of the @entity32 of @entity33			1
it is not too late to support the @entity3 people and to demand an end to violence against protesters , protection of @entity207 and free , fair and accountable elections			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 and @entity212 .			1

@entity211 , @entity212 : ahead of vote , @entity3 moving toward repression again
they say military cracking down on rights *groups* , making new election laws and arrests
they say @entity50 gave aid hoping it would buy cooperation from military ; it has *emboldened* it
writers : @entity50 forfeited trust of @entity3 people by allying with military ; it must change approach
