a former prosecutor who declined to bring charges against @entity2 a decade ago said wednesday that he wishes he could 've nailed the comedian on an allegation that he drugged and molested a woman at his @entity7 home			1
@entity8 also told @entity9 that he believed @entity2 -- a beloved figure who , with his wit and boyish smile , has charmed audiences as a family - friendly stand - up comic , the voice of @entity11 , the host of " @entity13 " and the star of a wildly popular eponymous sitcom -- lied to authorities			1
in january 2004 , @entity24 , then a 31 - year - old staffer for the women 's basketball team at @entity28 , @entity2 's alma mater , was at the comedian 's @entity29 , @entity7 , home when @entity2 provided her medication that made her dizzy , she alleged the following year			1
she later woke up to find her bra undone and her clothes in disarray , she further alleged to police in her home province of @entity38 in january 2005			0
@entity2 's attorney in the case , @entity41 , called the allegations " utterly preposterous " and " plainly bizarre " at the time , yet in a civil filing , @entity24 's lawyers said they had found 13 " @entity46 " with similar stories			1
@entity2 settled the civil suit in 2006			1
the terms of the settlement were not disclosed , but when journalist and publicist @entity52 came forward with another similar story this weekend , @entity2 attorney @entity51 denied her claim and others ' , labeling them " decade - old , discredited allegations			1
" @entity51 later amended that statement to say he was n't referring to @entity24 , who resolved her differences " to the mutual satisfaction of mr. @entity2 and ms. @entity24 years ago			1
" ' i could n't check her blood ' @entity8 , who was the district attorney for @entity64 , @entity7 , when @entity65 came forward in 2005 , now tells @entity9 he thought @entity24 was credible , and he thought @entity2 was evasive in his interview with prosecutors			1
@entity8 , whose assistants interviewed @entity2 , said he felt the comedian was setting up a defense that @entity24 was at his house on her own volition and that anything occurring between them was consensual			1
" back then , the desire on our part to move forward was pretty strong , " he said			0
" the problem with the case was she waited a year until she told police about it			2
" this left @entity8 no way to corroborate @entity65 's allegations , he said			2
he could n't check her blood , urine , hair or fingernails for traces of drugs , he could n't obtain hair or fiber for analysis , and he could n't obtain a warrant to search @entity2 's home for evidence			2
" i had a theory that @entity2 had drugged the woman using something to make her sleepy and to make her defenseless or unable to recall what happened , but because of the delay , i could n't check her blood , " he said			1
of @entity2 's interview with prosecutors , @entity8 said , " i thought he was lying			2
i thought he was evasive , and i thought that those things would be of value if i had another piece ( of evidence ) to go forward with			0
" the case would have come down to she said , he said , and while @entity8 felt strongly that @entity24 was telling the truth , her statements alone were not going to be enough to convict @entity2 , the ex-prosecutor said			1
" did i think he probably did something inappropriate ? yes			0
did i think that i could prove it beyond a reasonable doubt based on available , credible and admissible evidence ? no , i did n't , " he said			0
@entity8 released a statement on his office 's website in 2005 , saying that he found that " insufficient credible and admissible evidence exists upon which any charge against mr. @entity2 could be sustained beyond a reasonable doubt			2
" @entity24 's attorney filed the civil suit two weeks later			2
latest in line of accusations @entity8 's account comes a day after former supermodel @entity132 became the latest of a handful of women to accuse the 77 - year - old comic of sexual assault publicly			1
she told " @entity142 " that @entity2 raped her in 1982 after giving her a pill and a glass of red wine during a dinner in @entity141			0
" the last thing i remember was @entity2 in a patchwork robe , dropping his robe and getting on top of me			0
and i remember a lot of pain , " she said			0
@entity132 did not return a telephone call from @entity9 seeking comment , but @entity2 has repeatedly said previous allegations are untrue			1
he has never been prosecuted			0
his attorney , @entity152 , addressed @entity132 's allegations specifically in a statement , calling them a " fabricated lie " and saying they contradicted what she wrote in her autobiography and what she said during a 2002 @entity160 interview			0
since 2005 , several women have come forward with remarkably similar stories about being drugged and sexually assaulted by the comedian			0
this year , the accusations resurfaced , and earlier this month , a seemingly harmless post on @entity2 's @entity168 account turned them into a social media storm			2
after the accusations gained steam again , one of his accusers , @entity171 , turned to the public once more with an article in the @entity177 and interviews with @entity9			0
@entity179 alleged she was drugged , then raped , though she said she never saw drugs			0
" i woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes , " she said			0
on saturday , @entity183 broadcast an awkward interview with @entity2 in which he did n't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the accusations			1
@entity183 host @entity187 filled the airtime by saying @entity2 was just " shaking his head no. "			0

" i had a theory that @entity2 had drugged the woman , " ex-prosecutor tells @entity9
@entity2 settled a lawsuit with @entity24 in 2006 ; terms not disclosed
@entity24 waited a year to report crime , so prosecutor could n't corroborate story
@entity2 has repeatedly said allegations against him of sexual assault are untrue
