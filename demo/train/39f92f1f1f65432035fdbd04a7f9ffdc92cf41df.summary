-- with the election getting nearer , @entity2 's few , proudly open conservatives have been heating up the rhetoric			0
some have been quietly campaigning in a way that dodges the headlines			0
@entity9 , for example , endorsed @entity10 early in the campaign , an act as refreshing as it is sadly redundant			0
but most of the news reports have been dominated by the antediluvian antics of some pretty aged ( and by now probably unemployable ) actors			0
@entity17 lambasted the president for trying to get gays into the scouts and @entity21 says history might have turned out better if the @entity23 had won the @entity24			1
@entity25 rushed to the defense of @entity28 's mom after she sent a letter to her local newspaper calling @entity31 , " a liberal who supports the killing of unborn babies and same - sex marriage			2
" the modern @entity38 celebrity ideal , it seems , is all man			1
he could be a retired action movie star , likely to wear a cowboy hat , almost certainly smokes cigars and typically inhabits a political position to the @entity45 's right			1
there 's nothing necessarily wrong with any of things , except that the public pronouncements from these modern representatives less suggest someone who happens to be a big fan of @entity53 than someone who is undergoing the male menopause			0
when the @entity57 started in 2003 , @entity56 actually called the @entity58 and volunteered			0
he was surprised when an aide told him , " sorry , @entity56 , you 're too old to enlist			0
" today 's @entity61 might come from outside the mainstream of the movie industry , but it was n't always this way			1
during the 1944 presidential election , @entity66 threw a gala for @entity38 candidate @entity69 that featured elephants , bands and a-list stars like @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
when @entity77 hit @entity2 in the 1950s , the industry became more pronouncedly conservative			2
actor @entity78 was elected as a @entity38 senator from @entity80 in 1964 , and @entity81 entered the governor 's mansion in 1966			1
@entity85 , elected in 1968 , had movie tastes emblematic of @entity87 conservatism : according to historian @entity88 , he publicly denounced cussing in films and walked out of " @entity90 " halfway through because he thought it was anti-american			1
when he threw a re-election booster for his @entity2 backers in 1972 , one guest described it as " a cocktail party at the @entity96			2
" the invitation list might not have changed much from 1944 , but it was still impressive : @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 of these people were former @entity107 and the dress code was formal , not @entity17 denim			1
the president told his staff that they should offer " the very best brands of scotch and bourbon , not the ordinary stuff we 've used in the past			2
" this was one of the last occasions when a @entity38 @entity2 crowd was used to communicate sophistication rather than rebelliousness ; @entity85 was trying to cement an image as godfather of the nation			1
but the president also understood that as liberalism became more fashionable among the young , so conservatism was gaining momentum as a counter-cultural force of its own			0
that 's why @entity85 invited @entity101 ( aka @entity134 ) to be a delegate at that year 's @entity38 convention , while the movie introducing the president was narrated by @entity138			1
@entity85 was the first @entity38 president to tap into the electoral appeal of the cowboy star as the faded mascot of the silent majority , the gentleman of the rugged @entity144 who got by fine without welfare and who shot bad guys when he had to			1
it had a commercial appeal , too			0
that 's why in the 1970s , while @entity2 as an institution culturally drifted to the left , the movie industry also churned out movies that played upon suburban paranoia about crime , like " @entity158 " and " @entity159			0
" in short , an actor is n't just an actor , but a brand carefully built and marketed to sell movies			0
those brands can be found on both the left and right			0
in contemporary @entity2 , @entity166 has taken the archetype of an angry man burdened by liberal compassion to extremes , launching a tirade at @entity172 against " the whole ... world " for abandoning @entity175			2
likewise , @entity177 's perpetual threat to run for mayor of @entity179 or @entity181 's reinvention as a gay icon demonstrates that political branding can give actors an appeal beyond tv and movies			2
branding is n't a straightjacket for some , however			0
when @entity101 made " @entity191 " in 2008 , some critics took it to be a classic example of the " red state movie			0
" it was full of messages about family , crime and self - reliance			0
but when @entity101 made the " @entity201 " ad for the @entity200 , some @entity38 complained his tight - lipped , rugged style was being used to promote @entity31 's policies			1
on the whole , @entity2 conservatism has adapted to suit the culture warrior style of the tea party			1
first comes the market , then comes the brand			0
hence , if celebrity republicans seem outrageously reactionary , it 's an indicator of where the @entity38 and its base have moved and what it looks for in its screen idols			2
the party of @entity69 or @entity85 , men who basically spoke for the social establishments of their day , has now become something more populist and more rooted in working - class anger			1
sometimes , the men and women who are the advertisements for that brand can become consumed by the image and evolve into a pastiche of it			0
is there not something slightly absurd about the vain , aged machismo of @entity233 2 , a movie about violent septuagenarian mercenaries ? most of the @entity38 stars look like they could n't withstand a vigorous game of bridge at the @entity241 retirement home			1
the interesting question is how easily the anti-establishment antics of @entity17 or @entity21 sit with the preppy elitism of @entity245 , which is aimed more at the independent voter market			1
the answer is that they do n't , and that 's just one more problem that @entity245 has to overcome in november			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

@entity256 : conservative celeb ideal today is manly - man action hero , right of tea party
he says in past @entity38 drew mainstream stars ; today they get self - styled angry populists
he says since @entity85 , @entity38 has tapped into faded - cowboy - star - as - silent - majority branding
@entity254 : will likes of @entity21 , @entity17 help @entity245 win independents ? not likely
