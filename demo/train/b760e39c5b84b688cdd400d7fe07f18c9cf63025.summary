@entity0 -- a soldier being examined for possible post-traumatic stress disorder buys a gun off base and fails to register it with a commander , as required			1
now spc. @entity8 is dead , along with three others , in the second major shooting at @entity11 in less than five years			1
changes implemented after the 2009 massacre in which maj. @entity16 killed 13 people and injured dozens resulted in a better response by military police to wednesday 's incident at the sprawling @entity23 military base , @entity13 chief of staff gen. @entity12 told a @entity25 panel			1
however , few immediate answers emerged about how the military can prevent someone undergoing psychiatric evaluation from illegally bringing a firearm on base			1
it is one of several recurring security questions involving military bases , particularly @entity11 , the nation 's largest army base and scene of the 2009 attack as well as the 2011 arrest of an @entity13 private who tried to build a bomb to blow up troops stationed there			1
" something went wrong " " as we watched some of the events unfold yesterday , we saw some of the benefits and gains made out of that first @entity11 experience , " army secretary @entity47 told the @entity48 on thursday			1
" but something happened , something went wrong , and we need to know what that was			0
" the problem is not limited to @entity11			1
last year , a gunman with access to the @entity61 in the nation 's capital killed 12 people before police shot him to death			0
steps taken in response to the 2009 @entity11 shootings included creating a kind of " neighborhood watch " to teach the @entity13 community to recognize and report suspicious behavior , as well as plans to educate commanders on signs of workplace violence , and an enhanced 911 system			1
@entity11 shooting spree @entity12 said training for how to respond to a live shooter situation , including alert procedures , helped prevent wednesday 's violence from being " much , much worse			1
" a resident at the base , @entity86 , said authorities check identification and other things , but overall , " there has n't been a whole lot of extra protection on base " in the aftermath of the 2009 killings			1
after wednesday 's latest @entity11 shootings , military and security analysts distinguished between the specific issue of security at the @entity13 base and the broader debate over federal and state gun control laws			1
@entity8 legally purchased a .45 caliber handgun at a gun store in @entity107 , where @entity11 is located , sources told @entity1			1
he then took the weapon onto the base , which violated military regulations because he did n't register it there			2
two issues involved those are two distinct steps -- one involving background checks of people seeking to buy firearms and the other about security protocols at the base where more than 50,000 people live and work each day , noted former @entity122 assistant director @entity121 , @entity1 's law enforcement analyst			1
" this is not a @entity124 penitentiary , " @entity121 said of @entity11			2
" they 're not going to search every car , every trunk , pat down every person going through there			0
it 's a working city			0
" he also noted the base includes soldiers preparing for combat deployment , meaning " you have an extra percentage of the population that are trained to kill , if you will			2
" @entity11 shooter was @entity141 vet " so this is to be expected , " @entity121 said			2
" we do n't want it to happen and we say we 're going to do everything to stop it from happening , but we 're just fooling ourselves			0
it 's not going to be completely eliminated			0
there 's not everything you can do to completely stop this on military bases or in any other city for that matter			2
" @entity107 mayor @entity154 shared that opinion , telling @entity1 that " there 's no way that we could be ... 100 % certain that someone does n't have a gun at @entity11			1
" " that 's logistically impossible , " @entity154 added			1
a 1993 ban on private weapons at military bases got expanded at @entity11 following the @entity16 killings , making @entity8 's possession of his handgun on the base illegal			1
in response to wednesday 's shootings , which also injured 16 people including three critically , @entity172 rep. @entity172 of @entity23 called for ending the restrictions			2
let soldiers carry weapons on bases ? " this is the third mass shooting on a military base in five years , and it 's because our trained soldiers are n't allowed to carry defensive weapons , " @entity172 said			1
" anti-gun activists have turned our military bases into soft targets for killers			2
" @entity12 , however , said thursday that the armed military police and other base security personnel provided enough protection			1
" although we carry arms quite regularly overseas when we we 're deployed on a regular basis , i believe back here in the @entity124 , it 's more appropriate that we leave it to that , " he said in response to a question from @entity193 sen. @entity192 of @entity194			0
@entity193 rep. @entity202 earlier told @entity1 that his military experience showed the benefit of preventing ordinary soldiers from having firearms on base			2
" you have a situation where in a barracks on saturday night , you may have arguments , fights , " @entity202 said , adding that military brass should talk to " the sergeants , the @entity210 , the officers and people on the ground " about the effect that access to firearms could have on regular order and discipline before making any change			2
again , a female cop is a hero at @entity11 @entity202 and others called instead for better screening of possible mental illness among troops , a major issue for the military dealing with the impact of the @entity141 and @entity233 wars			1
@entity8 had a history of depression , anxiety and other psychiatric disorders , and was receiving treatment and taking antidepressants , according to military officials			0
" at the end of the day , it 's not going to be about the gun necessarily , it 's going to be about the soldier and the care that he should have gotten that he was n't getting , or somebody knew , " said retired @entity13 lt. gen. @entity241			2
" at the bottom , there 's a sergeant that knows that there 's something wrong with that soldier , that he needed more help			0
at the bottom of this , there 's a captain that knows			0
" continuity of care @entity1 military analyst @entity263 , a retired major general , noted that @entity8 had been transferred from another military base to @entity11 two months ago , which broke the continuity of any care he received for his mental issues			1
" you would n't have done that with a soldier who was undergoing some other type of physical , visible ailment			0
you would have left that young soldier where he or she was , " @entity263 said , adding that " i think that is a part of this process that needs to be evaluated as well			0
" @entity12 said the @entity13 does " quite significant screening today , but it does n't mean it 's right and it does n't mean we ca n't improve it			0
" " we have to constantly evaluate this , " he told the @entity25 panel			0
" this is something that we are going to have to deal with for a very long period of time , and that 's the consequence of 13 years of war			0
" what is it about @entity11 ? the broader issue of @entity124 gun laws raises more volatile and irreconcilable differences			1
" this is yet another story , a person with psychiatric problems walking into a gun shop and being able to obtain a weapon and ammunition and go shoot who he wants , " @entity121 said			0
" there 's no indication of any political will to change that situation , so we 'll just have to deal with it as it comes			0
" to emphasize his point , he noted how proposals for tougher gun laws failed to pass @entity311 after the 2012 killings in @entity313 of 20 first - graders and six educators by a 20 - year - old man with known mental health issues who had access to family firearms			1
" if a massacre of children does n't change situations like that , this certainly wo n't , " @entity121 said			0
gun control debate however , @entity326 rep. @entity326 of @entity23 called the state 's current system of background checks adequate , and @entity154 , the @entity107 mayor , warned that increasing restrictions could cause unintended consequences			0
" if we impose restrictions on the ability to carry or get a concealed handgun permit because someone is starting to seek help for problems they have , that could serve as a disincentive and keep people from seeking treatment , " @entity154 told @entity1			0
a @entity1 / @entity347 poll in november , as the first anniversary of the @entity313 school shootings approached , showed the nation evenly split on the issue			0
in @entity0 , house speaker @entity350 told reporters on thursday that " there 's no question that those with mental health issues should be prevented from owning weapons or being able to purchase weapons			2
" he touted funding for pilot programs studying the matter in legislation passed by @entity311 , calling the issue something " we need to continue to look at to find a way to keep weapons out of the hands of people who should not have them			0
" @entity1 's @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 and @entity371 contributed to this report .			0

a soldier examined for mental issues buys a gun and opens fire
the shootings raise issues of military base security and broader gun controls
changes made after a 2009 massacre at @entity11 helped , but not enough
" logistically impossible " to check everyone at @entity11 for guns
