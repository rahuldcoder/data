@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 was en route to his store , @entity9 's , on thursday when his son called from the shop and said , " @entity4 , there 's a fire			1
there 's a lot of smoke coming in			2
" @entity6 was n't concerned at first about his shop in @entity16			1
the fire was down the beach , not much of a threat			1
he did n't count on a 20 - to 25 - mph wind carrying the flames four blocks up the boardwalk from neighboring @entity0 , consuming a massive swath of the pathway freshly rebuilt after @entity27 struck last year			1
@entity27 hammered @entity9 's , and @entity6 had reopened his doors on july 3 , just in time for @entity30 celebrations			1
he was looking forward to keeping the store open another weekend , he said			2
@entity6 had n't seen the damage to his store when he spoke to @entity2 on friday , but he got close enough to see firefighters spraying water cannons through the side door of the store , packed with clothes and beach sundries			1
" i 'm sure that 's all messed up			2
i 'm just worried to see if the roof is intact			2
that 's the new front door , the 30 - foot steel door we put up in the front			2
so , we 'll see what 's going on , " he said , adding that on the bright side , " at least i 'm healthy and nobody got hurt			2
" the boardwalk was reparable after @entity27 wrecked it in october , but it took hundreds of firefighters nine hours to get the fire under control by thursday night			1
about 100 firefighters were still on the scene early friday , handling various hot spots and mopping up , said @entity61 fire administrator @entity60			2
there were no civilian injuries and " one , maybe two very , very minor firefighter injuries , " he said			1
gov. @entity65 said during a news conference that there are reports that two or three police officers suffered head injuries after falling off a fire vehicle			1
" they 've been taken to a trauma unit , and as soon as we have more information on them , we 'll share that with you , " he said			2
dozens of businesses were destroyed in the fire , @entity65 said			1
officials earlier noted that other structures were damaged when winds carried embers from the ice cream shop where they believe the fire started up the boardwalk to a nearby condominium complex , pier and an arcade , city and county officials said			1
those later blazes were contained			2
there was a firefighter convention in @entity98 , 90 miles south , at the time , so roughly 400 firefighters from 30 towns -- many of them volunteer units -- were able to respond , said @entity16 mayor @entity102			0
had they not been nearby , the damage could have extended beyond six blocks of boardwalk in @entity0 and two blocks in @entity16 , he said , estimating that reconstruction costs will reach the millions			0
" we 're just so grateful for what these gentlemen do every single day , putting their lives on the line to save life and property , in other communities , not just their own , " @entity102 said			0
upon first seeing the damage thursday , @entity65 said , " i feel like i want to throw up			1
" he added , " after all the effort and time and resources that we 've put in to help the folks in @entity0 and @entity16 rebuild			0
to see this going on ... is just unthinkable			0
" the @entity16 boardwalk was in the public eye shortly after @entity27 blew its famous @entity128 roller coaster into the water last year			1
the coaster was removed from the ocean in may , shortly before the boardwalk reopened for business			0
on thursday , firefighters ripped out the boardwalk at @entity136 in time to create a fire line that saved much of @entity16 from the fate that imperiled neighboring @entity0			0
they dug a 20 - foot trench where the street met the boardwalk to keep the brisk winds from further spreading the flames , @entity65 said thursday			1
" the destruction south of @entity136 , it 's complete , " he said			0
town officials plan to meet with business owners and help them rebuild , said @entity150 administrator @entity149			0
@entity102 added that the town will also assess the damage			0
" if there 's a silver lining , we just built it			0
we know what we 're doing , " the mayor said			0
" we 'll get it back up			0
" @entity6 's son , @entity161 , probably summed up the sentiments of business owners affected by the fire when he said he was distraught " after walking up here after @entity27 and seeing homes , buildings , everything just flooded , torn -- everything with sand			1
and all of a sudden , everyone rebuilds , and not even a year later , it all burns			0
" his father , though , said the response to @entity27 gave him optimism			1
" i 'm not ever going to get used to it , but i 've dealt with it before			0
i did n't have that kind of hopeless feeling i had after the storm , " he said			0
" now i know that things can be done and we 'll get back together and get it open			0
" authorities are not sure what caused the fire , but @entity149 said it started at @entity188 shop on the @entity189 about 2:15 p.m. @entity149 was at a meeting at town offices across the street when it began			1
the fire escalated to six alarms shortly before 4 p.m. et. @entity27 destroyed the @entity196 , which had been partially reopened this summer			1
the storm also damaged local water systems , and firefighters struggled with the supply thursday , @entity65 said			1
they had to tap into @entity203 seawater to extinguish the flames			0
@entity2 's @entity205 reported from @entity0 and @entity206 wrote from @entity207			0
@entity2 's @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
