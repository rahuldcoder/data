-- when @entity3 got a text from a friend asking him if he was one of the two men shown in @entity8 - released photos of @entity10 bombing suspects , his reply was short and light : lol			1
other messages from the teenager followed , including " you better not text me " and " come to my room and take whatever you want , " according to an @entity8 affidavit released wednesday			1
his friend took the texts as jokes , as if @entity3 found humor in the mere idea that he could be responsible for such horror			1
but when @entity26 showed one of their mutual friends that last text , the friend was n't laughing			0
" he believed he would never see @entity3 alive again , " the affidavit said of @entity33			1
what @entity26 , @entity33 and another friend , @entity34 , did next is the subject of a detailed , sometimes complex @entity8 affidavit released on wednesday			1
that document lays out the federal case as to why the three young men , like their friend @entity3 , are now in federal custody			1
read the criminal complaint the charges levied wednesday do not accuse the three friends of having any involvement in the april 15 attack			2
lawyers for two of the men insist that their clients are cooperating and deny any such role			0
did they suspect @entity3 could be responsible for such bloodshed ? according to @entity33 's account in the affidavit , while they were eating together about a month before the bombing , @entity3 told them he knew how to make a bomb			1
less clear , and more critical to their case , was when they concluded @entity3 was possibly involved in the @entity10 attacks , and what they did afterward			1
and were their actions -- both in tossing a backpack belonging to @entity3 and how they dealt with federal investigators -- criminal ? that may be decided by a jury , unless the charges are dropped or plea agreements are reached			1
suspect 's friends face years in prison if convicted what is known is that the four young men -- @entity3 , @entity80 , @entity26 and @entity33 -- enrolled in fall 2011 at the @entity81 and became friends			1
@entity26 and @entity33 were in the @entity83 on student visas from @entity85 , and spoke @entity86 as did @entity3			2
@entity34 , a high school classmate of @entity3 , called @entity87 , @entity88 , his home , as did @entity3			2
they hung out together , went out together -- including to @entity91 's @entity90 , as a 2012 photo with @entity26 , @entity33 and @entity3 showed			2
@entity26 told investigators that he 'd gotten to know @entity3 's family and had repeatedly gone to his home when the family lived in @entity87			1
and they spent time together after the deadly @entity98 blasts			0
two days after that attack , on april 17 , @entity26 told law enforcement officers that he drove to @entity3 's dormitory room on the campus of their southern @entity88 school and texted to his friend to come down to meet him			1
@entity3 -- who had noticeably shorter hair at the time , @entity26 recalled -- came down , the two chatted , and that was that			2
@entity3 spent that night , until around midnight , at the @entity111 apartment of @entity33			2
the next afternoon , @entity33 went to class on campus and got a ride home from @entity3 , the federal affidavit states			1
that happened not long before 5 p.m. , when the @entity8 released its first photos of the two @entity10 bombing suspects			1
one wore a dark baseball cap , a light collarless shirt and a dark - colored jacket			0
the other had a hooded sweatshirt , black jacket and a white baseball cap turned backward			0
sources : @entity128 spoke to widow after photos released it was the latter suspect that caught @entity34 ' eye			2
and it also got the attention of @entity26 , when he got home that night and turned on the tv			0
could that be @entity3 ? the night of thursday , april 18 , authorities say that @entity3 and @entity128 were on the run -- allegedly responsible for killing a @entity142 police officer , carjacking a @entity143 , then tossing explosives and trading gunfire with authorities on a high - speed chase through @entity10 suburbs			1
@entity3 's friends were active that night as well , some 60 miles south			1
while the three 19 - year - olds offered slightly different details and time frames , a common chain of events emerges from their remarks to investigators as laid out in the @entity8 affidavit			0
at some point , they exchanged texts about the " news " and agreed to meet at @entity3 's dorm room in @entity162			1
@entity3 's roommate let them in , saying @entity3 had left a few hours earlier , according to @entity26			1
it was around then that @entity33 says that @entity26 showed them a text message from @entity3 that they could take whatever they needed from his room -- which @entity33 interpreted as meaning he 'd never be back			2
while watching a movie , one or more of them spotted a backpack			0
@entity34 -- who at first denied to investigators ever going to the dorm room , then later changed his story , the affidavit states -- said @entity26 found it when he " went through ( @entity3 's ) belongings			1
" inside , @entity34 noticed about seven tubular fireworks , each between 6 to 8 inches long			0
the fireworks ' powder had been taken out			2
that was n't all they found			0
@entity26 also came across a jar of @entity187 that he thought @entity3 used " to make bombs , " according to the affidavit			2
by then , the same document states , @entity26 knew @entity3 was involved in the @entity98 bombing -- a judgment that his lawyer , @entity193 , disputed wednesday , saying " his first inkling came much later			1
" who are @entity33 , @entity26 and @entity34 ? whatever their rationale -- be it to help a friend or cover up for him -- the three men left with the backpack			0
@entity26 said he took @entity3 's laptop computer too , because he felt @entity3 's roommate might get suspicious if they left with the backpack alone , the affidavit states			1
they all ended up at @entity26 's and @entity33 's @entity111 apartment			0
there they saw the news coverage on the bombings , wallpapered with photos of the two suspects			2
@entity26 and @entity33 " started to freak out , because it became clear from a @entity0 report that we were watching that ( @entity3 ) was one of the @entity98 bombers , " @entity34 told investigators			0
the @entity87 resident said he did n't understand much of what @entity26 and @entity33 said afterward because they talked mostly in @entity86			0
at some point though -- @entity26 said it was later that night , @entity33 thought it was early the following morning -- @entity3 's backpack was put in a black garbage bag , lugged outside , and thrown in a dumpster			1
this came after all three friends talked about what to do first , according to the affidavit			0
@entity34 ' response , for instance , to @entity26 : " do what you have to do			0
" a garbage truck emptied that dumpster that friday -- the same day that @entity3 was finally captured , hurting from apparent gunshot wounds to his head , neck and legs and hand , in the back of a boat parked in a @entity248 , @entity88 , backyard			0
his friends were n't far behind in following him into federal custody			0
after 10 hours of questioning that friday , @entity26 and @entity33 were detained the next day on alleged visa violations , according to @entity193			0
six days later , the backpack they 'd thrown away was found -- this time in a @entity111 landfil			0
@entity256 was an assortment of fireworks , a jar of @entity187 and a homework assignment sheet from the @entity81 , among other items			0
and on wednesday , @entity26 , @entity33 and @entity34 were in court accused of covering up for their friend , and hampering an investigation into the bloody attacks that jarred a city and a nation			0
