-- with the 10th anniversary of 9/11 just weeks away , the rebuilding of the @entity2 in @entity3 goes on round the clock -- reshaping the skyline			1
as one construction crane lifts steel beams atop @entity10 -- the skyscraper taking the place of the @entity2 -- another simultaneously delivers loads of concrete a few floors below			1
the steel frame can be seen from miles around now rising stoically above lower @entity16			0
hundreds upon hundreds of construction workers below scurry about like little ants			0
they 're putting the finishing touches on the @entity21 , building the new transportation hub and erecting 4 @entity2 , another impressive office tower at the site			1
the redevelopment of the site is taking place at a fast pace ; @entity10 rises at the rate of one floor per week			2
it 's expected to be 80 stories tall when people gather on the plaza for the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that destroyed the buildings and took the lives of 2,753 people			2
" it is a towering building and it 's a building of towering strength , " said @entity40 , executive director of the @entity41 & @entity42 , which owns the site and oversees the construction			2
the new 1 @entity2 will fill the void in the skyline left behind when the @entity2 collapsed			1
" i think it balances the @entity3 skyline , " @entity40 said			0
" the glass that it 's sheathed in will be so bright and the mast going to 1,776 feet , i think , will be the point of reference for the entire region for the next hundred years			2
" @entity61 , @entity60 to be at 9/11 anniversary ceremony , @entity59 mayor says while the building is taking the place of the @entity2 , only time will tell whether it will be a fitting substitute for the monoliths that anchored lower @entity16 for the better part of three decades			1
those two buildings were more than just concrete , steel and glass to so many people across the country , and especially to @entity3			0
" when the @entity2 were gone i felt disoriented in the city for a long time , " said @entity75 , an architectural photographer with a degree in @entity77			1
he started taking pictures of the @entity2 from just about every angle imaginable in the late 1970s			1
some of those photographs appear in his self - published book titled @entity2			1
" i started photographing the @entity85 and i saw distant views from the @entity85 where the @entity2 were there , " said @entity84			1
" then , i photographed @entity16 as part of a project			0
... the @entity2 became very present in those pictures			1
" it was hard not to include the towers			0
@entity84 would see them as he drove toward the city on the @entity95			1
there was the view from @entity98 of the buildings rising above the @entity3 skyline way off in the distance			0
but he most liked the glimpses that he would catch of the @entity2 rising between smaller buildings as he looked downtown on many of the city 's streets			1
" the buildings were really signposts			0
if you came out of the subway anywhere in the city and you were a little bit disoriented at first you could always look one way or the other and see the @entity2 , " @entity84 said			1
" it was almost like a needle of a compass for me			0
" he called the destruction of towers " a kind of civic vandalism on an epic scale			0
" fire truck lowered into @entity21 in honor of its lost crew on september 11 , 2001 , @entity84 found himself in @entity131 helplessly watching on tv as the @entity2 came down			1
" it was gut - wrenching			2
i did n't even realize it until then that i had such a personal relationship with these buildings			0
i realized that i had been photographing them for much of my adult life			0
" he returned to @entity3 as soon as flights resumed and he quickly made his way to lower @entity16 to see the destruction for himself			0
he had his camera in hand but he found it difficult to take pictures			0
the days and weeks that followed were filled with depression , anxiety and many sleepless nights for @entity84			2
what 's your 9/11 story ? share it with @entity155 as he spoke in the shadow of 1 @entity2 , the building grew taller by the minute			1
" i 'm not unhappy to see these buildings going up , " said @entity84			2
" i 'm not sure in the end whether it 's the right thing			0
i do n't think anybody knows whether re-creating the @entity2 is what should have happened or not			2
" at first , he agreed with most people that something needed to go up in the place of the @entity2 to once again anchor the city			1
" i was pretty certain that we needed to do that ; there needed to be a very tall building with a spire downtown			0
" but @entity84 's feelings have evolved over time			1
" i think i am in a wait - and - ee attitude right now			0
i want to see what this building , which is about two - thirds of the way up now , i want to see how it really functions on the skyline			0
" @entity182 part of ' rising : rebuilding @entity183 ' the destruction of the @entity2 left behind a tremendous scar in the city 's skyline and in the psyche of @entity3			1
@entity84 thinks 1 @entity2 has the potential to heal that scar			1
i do n't think it 's a sure thing , " @entity84 said			1
" i do n't think building buildings is ever a sure thing -- how it 's going to work out in a city , especially a complex city like this one			2
" but he is happy to see something new taking shape in lower @entity16			0
@entity84 said after 9/11 , " the city moved forward and one way to move forward is to build			1
that 's what @entity3 has always been about -- not dwelling in the past and moving on			0
i 'm not sure the rest of the country is ready to move on but i think @entity3 is			0
" @entity84 is taking pictures of @entity208 as it rise above @entity183			1
he sees it as a continuation of his work photographing the @entity2			2
but he 's not sure the building can ever be a substitute for what once stood on the site			0
@entity219 group wants to stop @entity2 cross			2

photographer @entity75 started taking pictures of the @entity2 in the late 1970s
@entity84 's photographs appear in his self - published book " @entity2 "
@entity84 : " when the @entity2 were gone i felt disoriented in the city for a long time "
