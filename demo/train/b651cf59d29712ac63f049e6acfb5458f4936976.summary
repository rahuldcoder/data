-- with tuesday 's recall vote , taxpayers in @entity2 affirmed gov. @entity5 's reforms and put an end to the state 's unholy alliance between big government and big labor			1
the reign of entrenched public sector unions may be over and a new era of self - governing fiscal responsibility beginning			0
the importance of @entity5 's victory can not be understated			2
this is , after all , @entity2 -- the birthplace of the @entity18 and the first state to permit collective bargaining			1
not since @entity21 in 1984 has @entity2 voted @entity22 , and in 2008 , @entity23 took the state by a whopping 14 points			1
analysis : @entity2 now tougher for @entity23 , but still uphill climb for @entity27 and yet @entity5 won by seven points tuesday , becoming the first governor in @entity31 history to survive a recall election			1
lt. gov. @entity33 also beat the recall			0
the @entity2 saga ends close to where it began : a sobering defeat for organized labor and a stunning victory for fiscal conservatives			1
@entity5 took office in 2011 facing a $ 3.6 billion budget hole			2
he had few options at his disposal to balance the budget : raise taxes , make draconian cuts or go after the sweetheart public employee pension and health care plans			0
he bravely chose the latter , requiring public employees to pay 5 % of their salaries toward their pensions ( they paid virtually nothing before ) and 12.6 % of their health care premiums ( less than what private and federal employees pay )			0
furthermore , he ended collective bargaining except for wages and made automatic union dues optional			1
@entity5 's @entity2 win big blow to unions , smaller one to @entity23 before @entity5 's reforms , @entity2 state employees enjoyed salary and benefits that were about 28 % higher than comparable private sector workers , according to a new study from the @entity71			1
even after his much decried reforms , @entity2 public employees ' total compensation is still about 22 % greater -- $ 81,637 versus $ 67,068 -- than similar private sector workers			2
yet how were @entity5 's proposals received ? democratic state senators fled to @entity78 to avoid votes ; up to 100,000 protesters stormed the state @entity81 in @entity83 , climbing through windows and trashing the building ; teachers handed out fake doctors ' notes to skip school and protest , some even bringing their students with them ; signs and fliers compared @entity5 to @entity95 ; a @entity97 state senator cursed out a @entity22 lawmaker ; and lastly , @entity97 initiated recall elections on state senators , the lieutenant governor and @entity5			1
in the end , @entity97 have little , if anything , to show for it			0
that 's because @entity5 's reforms have done everything he promised			0
he recouped the state 's budget shortfall without raising taxes			2
school districts that enacted his reforms were able to meet budgets without firing teachers , enlarging class sizes or cutting programs			0
in fact , some even reported budget surpluses			0
property taxes fell for the first time in 13 years , and @entity5 cited figures that showed @entity2 has added 35,000 jobs since he took office			1
the public sector union machine , once a colossus of @entity97 power , looks weak in the wake of @entity5 's triumph			0
with mandatory union dues now extinct , union membership has withered in @entity2			0
@entity18 's local 24 in @entity83 has seen its ranks drop from 22,300 to 7,100 , while @entity18 's statewide membership has been cut in half			0
in short , @entity5 has broken the long running cycle of handoffs and paybacks between union leadership and state politicians			2
where is the @entity141 outrage ? in 2007 , then - sen. @entity23 promised , " ( @entity147 ) f @entity31 workers are being denied their right to organize when i 'm in the @entity150 , i will put on a comfortable pair of shoes and i will walk on that picket line with you as president of the @entity31			1
" in february 2011 , president @entity23 called @entity5 's proposals an " assault " on unions			2
but less than two years later , @entity23 would n't set foot in @entity2 before the recall			1
his endorsement of @entity157 came via @entity158 , hardly instilling confidence in the @entity97 cause			0
public sector unions were left out in the @entity2 cold			0
on the other hand , the untold story of the @entity2 saga may be the resurgence of the tea party			1
local tea party groups , like the @entity170 tea party , and national groups , such as @entity172 , have hosted dozens of rallies for @entity5 , recruiting volunteers from around the country and pouring in campaign donations in unparalleled numbers			1
any rumors of a tea party demise have been short - lived			1
come november , @entity2 will be the conservative rallying cry			0
fittingly , the @entity183 fight song may very well be the anthem : on , @entity2 ! on , @entity2 ! plunge right through that line ! run the ball clear down the field , a touchdown sure this time ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity193 : recall vote a huge victory for conservatives , tea party
he says @entity2 gov. @entity5 faced *multibillion* - *dollar* budget deficit
@entity191 says cutting worker benefits erased deficit , lowered taxes , helped state *economy*
he says @entity23 did n't fulfill *vow* to stand with workers who lost collective bargaining on benefits
