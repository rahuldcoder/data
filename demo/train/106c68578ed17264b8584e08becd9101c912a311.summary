he claimed he informed his wife at the time and asked for her forgiveness			2
the couple was criticized by some activists for not revealing the affair prior to his presidential bid , as the news could have damaged @entity22 chances if it became publicly known during a general election campaign in which @entity3 was the party 's standard bearer			2
" this was our private matter , and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well , " @entity1 said			1

" it 's really hard to use a word like forgiveness but we found a new of interacting with one another that is healthy -- and i think for the kids -- and really easy for us , which is great , " she said			2
