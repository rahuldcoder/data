-- not since that cranky old lady asked " where 's the beef ? " has a fast food chain had an ad as funny as the @entity7 cows begging people to " @entity7			1
" and when i moved to @entity10 , where the franchise company is based , i did			2
then i found out the company was funneling portions of its proceeds to fight gay rights			1
now i 'm back to eating chicken , and not chikin			0
this is the @entity18 at work -- freedom of speech meets freedom of expression			1
@entity24 's mayor @entity23 , @entity26 's @entity25 and a handful of other mayors threatening to ban @entity7 because of anti-gay marriage remarks made by its president , @entity30 ? not so much			1
are you demonstrating at @entity7 this week ? such a position may sound noble			1
it may be coming from a good place in the officials ' hearts			0
but thankfully it is unconstitutional			0
the last thing anyone , liberal or conservative , should want is local government censoring what a private citizen can say by way of withholding permits and licenses			0
with the exception of a few examples , such as falsely yelling fire in a crowded space , freedom of speech is n't contingent upon what a person says			2
so members of the @entity56 can legally rally and spew hate about black people			2
@entity59 can protest and say terrible things about a soldier during his funeral			0
and @entity63 can say whatever he wants about gay people			1
that 's the @entity18 at work			1
you know what else is constitutional ? @entity23 and @entity25 making out with each other in protest			0
in response to @entity63 's remarks -- and the fact @entity7 has donated millions to organizations that fight gay rights -- the @entity76 is organizing a same - sex kiss - in to be held at @entity7 restaurants across the country friday			1
i 'm not sure if @entity23 and the others are free that day , but unlike their talk of banning the franchise , their participation in the lip lock is totally legal			0
it 's an unconventional protest for sure , one that lends itself to great video , funny interviews and front page stories with women kissing and the word " chicks " somewhere in the headline			2
if you 're thinking of joining in , may i suggest making out before eating a chikin sandwich			0
kiss - ins are so much more enjoyable when protesters have fresh breath			0
opinion : @entity7 and free speech perhaps more entertaining than the kisses will be seeing how @entity107 's management handles the situation			1
having the ceo ramble on about gay people bringing @entity112 's wrath down upon the nation is a pr nightmare , but it 's manageable			1
video of staff kicking people out of its restaurants for being gay -- and let 's face it , if straight people are kissing and get to stay , that 's exactly what it will be -- well , that just opens the franchise up for a more significant financial backlash			1
boycotts , like freedom of speech , are constitutional			0
perhaps sensing that could be the next step in this debacle , the company recently issued a statement on its @entity149 page that read in part , " the @entity7 culture and service tradition in our restaurants is to treat every person with honor , dignity and respect --- regardless of their belief , race , creed , sexual orientation or gender			2
" this echoes remarks made by @entity63 last year when he was asked about the company 's donations to anti-gay groups			0
back then he said " we 're not anti-anybody			0
our mission is to create raving fans			0
" well , he 's got people raving , but i do n't think this is what he had in mind			1
@entity166 mayor @entity165 said he " could not agree more with the mayors in terms of their positions , and i could n't disagree more with @entity7 and their position , and if it 's appropriate for us to take a hard stand and say , ' you 're not welcomed , ' we 'll consider it			1
" again , that 's not necessarily the @entity18 at work , but it does sound like another pair of high - profile lips are eligible for friday 's kiss - in			1
to be fair , @entity63 does have a lot of supporters who are choosing to eat mor chikin			0
my take : @entity7 - a controversy reveals religious liberty under threat @entity188 recently live tweeted during a @entity7 visit , @entity187 was photographed this weekend with a bag of chikin and @entity192 declared this upcoming wednesday as " @entity193			2
" this is what the forefathers had in mind when they composed the @entity18 : liberals making out during lunch and conservatives stuffing their face with chikin in the name of @entity204			2
@entity112 , i love this country			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : i was a @entity7 fan until i heard of its stance on gay rights
he says the @entity18 does n't allow mayors to ban @entity7 based on its president 's views
the @entity18 does permit people to *peacefully* protest , he says
