-- it is the world 's rarest whale and one of its rarest mammals			1
almost a thing of legend , scientists have never seen a spade - toothed beaked whale alive and , until recently , only had limited skeletal evidence they existed			1
so rare is the species that when a pair of dead whales washed up on a @entity15 beach in late 2010 , scientists did n't even know what they had			1
but now they do ... and they 're a bit giddy			0
" it was a bit like finding the holy grail , " said @entity20 , the collection manager of marine mammals at the @entity23 @entity23			0
he 's one of the co-authors of a paper published this week in the journal " @entity30 " documenting the discovery			0
another co-author , @entity31 with the @entity32 at the @entity33 , made the discovery in 2011 while testing tissue samples from the whales with colleague @entity36			2
" when she showed me the result we were both a bit stunned , " @entity37 said			0
" we re-ran the sample again to make sure , even though the dna clearly showed it was a spade - toothed beaked whale			1
" the results were stunning because only three partial specimens of the species were known to exist -- two collected in @entity15 in 1872 and in the 1950s and a third found on @entity48 off the coast of @entity50 in 1986			1
the spade - toothed beaked whale looks similar to a large black , white and gray dolphin with its long pointed snout			1
scientists believe they grow to be about 17 feet long			2
adult males have large exposed teeth as the name suggests			0
mistaken for a @entity61 's beaked whale after their discovery , the adult female and juvenile male were buried near where they were found on @entity66			1
scientists were anxious to recover the remains and did in early 2012			1
" we now have collected the only complete specimen in the world of this rarest of whales , " @entity20 said			2
" sadly the head of the adult female had washed away through beach erosion			1
" still , the recovery of the remains is a bonanza for scientists who study cetaceans			2
" yes , the discovery is indeed most exciting , " said geology professor @entity80 , who studies the evolution of whales and dolphins at @entity84 but who was not involved in the research			0
" now we have an idea of the appearance and size of the species			0
" its lifestyle and habits are another story -- not surprising for a species researchers have never seen alive			0
scientists can only guess based on what they know about other beaked whales , which are often boat - shy , spend little time at the surface and dive to depths of 6,600 feet ( about 2,000 meters ) , according to @entity20			1
they probably dine on squid			0
yet , scientists are excited by the challenge			0
" this is the species of whale that we know the least about in the world , " @entity37 said			2
" it has never been seen before , as far as we know , and for the first time we have an idea of what it looks like			0

the spade - toothed beaked whale is rarest of whales
scientists only had partial skeletal remains of the species before
an adult female and juvenile male washed up on a @entity15 beach in 2010
only *months* later did researches know what they had
