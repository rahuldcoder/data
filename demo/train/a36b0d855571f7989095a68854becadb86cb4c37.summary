-- the happiest day in @entity2 's life -- next to the day his daughter was born -- was march 5 , 2013			2
when his phone rang , he looked down and saw the 301 area code			2
it must be the @entity8 , he thought			1
he did n't know anyone else in @entity10			2
indeed , dr. @entity11 was calling to say that after five months of waiting , @entity2 's 12 - year - old daughter @entity12 had been accepted into a clinical trial at @entity8 headquarters in @entity15 , @entity10			1
she could begin the week of september 30			1
@entity2 thanked the doctor and hung up the phone			2
" baby , hopefully we can get you a cure now , " he said as he hugged and kissed his daughter			0
@entity12 has neurofibromatosis , a rare genetic disorder			0
countless tumors in various parts of her body tangle around her nerves and grow into her soft tissue			0
one tumor the size of a grapefruit crushed her esophagus and her carotid artery when she was 4 years old			0
another tumor collapsed a lobe of her right lung			0
the growths are starting to cut off sensation to her right arm and left leg ; soon she will lose function of them entirely			0
she 's on four different pain medications , including two types of morphine			1
@entity12 has had two surgeries and 24 rounds of radiation			0
the tumors have continued to grow			0
she underwent medical experiments to use the drugs thalidomide and @entity53			0
doctors have told @entity2 his daughter will likely die before her 20th birthday			1
" this @entity8 trial is her last hope , " @entity2 said			1
the @entity61 boarded a plane monday from their home in @entity64 , @entity65 , to head to @entity15			0
but during the trip -- even as they checked in at the @entity67 at @entity8 -- they were n't feeling hopeful that @entity12 would be able to start taking the experimental drug , called hydrogen sulfate , on friday as scheduled			1
hydrogen sulfate , or @entity71 , has been tested in adults and children with cancer			1
@entity8 doctors think it might be able to prevent benign tumors like @entity12 's from growing , or at least shrink the tumors and slow down their growth			1
@entity2 feared the government shutdown would keep @entity12 from being able to start the study at all			1
@entity12 is one of about 200 new patients , including some 30 children , who come every week to the @entity83 in @entity15 , @entity10 , to begin clinical trials			1
these patients are being told they will have to wait until the government starts up again to start their trials , according to @entity8 spokesman @entity88			1
taking care of @entity12 , as well as her disabled grandmother , is a full - time job for @entity2 , a single father			0
an @entity93 veteran , he 's used to hard work and trying times , but as he waited monday , tuesday and wednesday for word from the doctors , he grew more and more worried -- and angry			2
on wednesday he tweeted , " # governmentshutdown needs 2 end # now hurting sick people			0
have the # @entity101 come here to apologize to my young daughter & others			0
" " finally we 're here and our government ca n't get its act together , " he told @entity0			1
then at 3 p.m. wednesday , there was a turnaround			0
for reasons that are unclear , @entity12 's doctors said she would be able to start taking the hydrogen sulfate on friday as scheduled			1
no one knows how many other new patients like @entity12 also managed to get into their @entity8 studies despite the government shutdown			1
" if a child or adult patient is in desperate need for treatment , those people will be handled in a different manner , " @entity88 said , " and will more than likely be seen by physicians or nurses at the @entity83			2
" while relieved that his daughter can start the trial , @entity2 worries about the kids who wo n't be able to			1
there are the other patients , like @entity12 , who were supposed to start this week at the @entity83 , and if the shutdown continues , another 200 patients every week will face the same dilemma			1
even though @entity12 's been lucky , the shutdown has still made her trip more difficult			2
with 75 % of @entity8 's employees on furlough , the testing takes much longer than it should			1
an eye doctor 's appointment this week , for example , should have taken one hour , but lasted more than three			2
exhausted and in pain , @entity12 had to take a dose of morphine to get through it			0
and then another setback , this one unrelated to the shutdown : doctors found a new tumor in @entity12 's eye			1
this medical complication means she might not be able to get the drug friday as planned			2
@entity2 said he knows what he would do if he could talk to members of @entity155 in person			0
" i 'd put my daughter in their face and i 'd say , ' why are you putting politics above my daughter 's life , or any other child 's life ? ' " he said			0
" this is not a game			0
" @entity12 said her message to @entity155 would be much shorter			0
" @entity0 's @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this piece .			0

some 200 new patients , including 30 children , start a clinical trial at @entity8 every week
with the government shutdown , these patients are being told they will have to wait to begin
@entity181 will be *allowed* to receive treatment , doctors say , on friday
