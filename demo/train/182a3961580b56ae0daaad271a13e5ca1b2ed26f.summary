you 've been told for years that popping a multivitamin every day might help you live longer			1
but the daily multi habit has been getting a bit of bad press lately			2
vitamins can help provide key nutrients for individuals whose diets are low on fruits and veggies			2
first , @entity11 , a watchdog of the supplement industry , found that more than half of the 21 multis it tested had too much ( or too little ) of certain vitamins -- or had been contaminated with dangerous substances such as lead			1
then a controversial paper from researchers in @entity20 and other @entity22 countries , published in the @entity23 , made the claim that taking vitamins may actually shorten your life			2
what 's the real story ? @entity30 talked to leading nutrition experts at @entity33 and @entity34 universities to find out and to get some answers on this and other confusing info about vitamins			0
are multivitamins safe ? vitamins have been recommended for years because they help you get key nutrients if your diet 's low on fruits and veggies -- and may even help prevent cancer and heart disease			0
and it 's unlikely that one critical paper ( speculating that vitamin supplements might upset your body 's natural healing process and boost your risk of death ) will change that			0
@entity57 : your vitamin cheat sheet longtime vitamin experts at @entity34 and the @entity60 at @entity61 continue to say multis are n't dangerous and the paper 's findings are wrong			1
the paper analyzed previous studies , including many with people who were sick before taking vitamins , so there 's a good chance vitamins were n't responsible for shortening their lives			1
experts say the paper also ignored two major studies that found vitamins reduced the risk of death			1
at the same time , the study from @entity11 shows that you ca n't assume just any vitamin is safe			1
because there are no uniform manufacturing rules for supplements , a multi may not contain what the bottle claims , could be contaminated with something from the manufacturing plant , or might have tainted ingredients			0
@entity57 : 20 antioxidant powerhouses your best bet : avoid the vitamins singled out by @entity11 , and stick with mainstream names such as @entity95 's , which were found to be free of impurities and accurately labeled			1
also , check vitamin bottles for the @entity98 ( @entity98 ) , @entity99 ( @entity99 ) , or @entity11 ( @entity11 ) seals			1
the @entity98 and @entity99 are nonprofit groups that verify whether companies offer contamination - free products and use good manufacturing practices			1
not every brand has the seals -- some do n't want to submit to testing -- but those that do ( @entity107 and @entity108 made carry the @entity98 seal , for instance ) are reliable			1
how much should i spend to get the biggest benefits ? @entity113 is n't a sign of quality			1
in fact , some of the priciest vitamins -- like @entity118 in the @entity119 and @entity120 , which cost more than $ 39.95 per bottle -- failed the @entity124 tests			0
a mainstream brand such as one - a - day women 's is $ 8.99 for a bottle of 100 tablets at @entity129 , about 9 cents per day			1
how do i find the right multi for me ? in your childbearing years , make sure your multi has 400 micrograms ( mcg ) of folic acid , which helps make and maintain new cells			0
and pregnant women should take a vitamin with 600 mcg of folic acid daily ; this nutrient also reduces the incidence of neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida			1
a premenopausal woman should look for a multivitamin with iron to replace the iron lost during menstruation			1
menopausal women should go without the iron			1
" too much iron may raise the risk of heart disease , " says @entity151 , ph.d. , professor of nutrition and epidemiology at @entity155			2
@entity57 : a new way to " pop " your vitamins if you 're taking a prescription , check with your doctor about risky interactions			1
( @entity166 , for instance , may be a problem if you 're taking a blood thinner			0
) if you 're a cancer patient , you should ask your doctor about risks before taking vitamins			2
" cancer cells need vitamins to grow , too , " @entity151 says			0
plus , some vitamins can interfere with chemotherapy			0
what 's the best way to avoid that queasy feeling after taking a multi ? " consider switching brands , " @entity151 suggests			0
@entity181 is the best way to determine which brands wo n't break down poorly in your stomach and lead to irritation			2
also , take your multi with food because your body needs some fat ( or lipids ) to absorb some of the individual vitamins			0
the delivery method ( pill , liquid , gummy bear ) makes no difference			0
but vitamins in liquid form may degrade more quickly on the shelf			0
how much of each vitamin should my multi have ? the amount per serving numbers on the label should match the government 's @entity206 ( @entity206 )			0
it 's ok if they 're higher as long as they do n't exceed the tolerable upper limit ( @entity212 )			2
( to find the @entity213 and @entity214 , go to @entity216 / links			0
) while most vitamins are listed in milligrams ( mg ) or micrograms ( mcg ) , the label may use @entity219 ( international units ) for vitamins a , @entity222 , and @entity166 the @entity213 are 2,300 @entity219 for vitamin a , 200 for @entity222 , and 22 for @entity166 what about the label 's % @entity226 column ? look at it with a skeptical eye : those numbers have n't been updated since 1968			2
