-- @entity2 's embattled government will get at least 10 fighter jets from @entity4 -- and they want more , @entity4 state media reports -- moves that come amid rocky diplomatic efforts to peacefully end the @entity10 nation 's bloody civil war			1
a source involved in @entity4 's defense complex told the official @entity14 news agency friday that @entity4 will sell @entity2 president @entity16 's government @entity18 fighter jets to fulfill a " contract ... concluded long ago			1
" a @entity2 delegation in @entity21 is pressing for even more jets , with @entity24 executive @entity23 telling @entity4 's state - run @entity26 's news that his company and these @entity2 authorities are talking about the " details and time frame of a possible contact			1
" such discussions come on the heels of the @entity35 's decision to end its @entity2 arms embargo			1
that move was seen as opening the door for @entity40 nations to help rebel fighters militarily , though it may give @entity4 more wiggle room to back its longtime ally , @entity16			1
it 's not clear how weapons , fighter jets and ammunition flowing into @entity2 will affect the fighting there , much less the heretofore unsuccessful attempts to forge a negotiated settlement			1
about 80,000 people have been killed since the start of hostilities more than two years ago , @entity54 president @entity53 said earlier this month			2
another 1.5 million or more people have fled the country			0
in addition to the fighter jets , @entity4 reportedly sold six s - 300 air defense systems to @entity2 under a 2010 contract			1
asked thursday about these and other arms sales , @entity16 said it is " not our policy to talk publicly about military issues in terms of what we possess or what we receive			0
" blast in @entity75 neighborhood kills 8 " as far as @entity4 is concerned , the contracts have nothing to do with the crisis , " he told @entity77 's @entity76 , according to a transcript from @entity2 's official @entity80 news service			1
" we have negotiated with them on different kinds of weapons for years , and @entity4 is committed to honoring these contracts			1
" @entity21 , however , has said such deliveries would conform with international law and has denied supplying @entity2 with weapons that can be used against civilians			1
@entity93 secretary of state @entity92 described any transfer of s - 300s to the region as " not helpful			2
" " whether it 's an old contract or not , it has a profoundly negative impact on the balance of interests and the stability of the region , and it does put @entity103 at risk , " he said			2
@entity92 added that halting the bloodshed peacefully should be everyone 's first priority			0
" the best chance to save @entity2 ( and ) for a future @entity2 that represents all @entity2 people and moves beyond this massacre , devastation , killing , sectarian violence ... is through a peaceful resolution that comes about in an organized way , " he said friday at a joint news conference in @entity109 with @entity111 foreign minister @entity110			1
" in @entity121 , we will test who is serious			0
are the @entity4 serious pushing to that ? i believe they are			1
( but ) it is not helpful to have a lot of other ammunition , other supplies overtly going in			0
" @entity2 arms embargo : why more weapons to @entity2 is a mistake conference on crisis planned for @entity135 he was referring to an international conference on the crisis slated for @entity135			1
the plans are being worked out , but @entity16 predicted it will take place in june			0
" we have announced a couple of days ago that we agree in principle to attend , " he said			0
but the @entity2 leader made clear that his position may change , and @entity75 ' delegation may withdraw , if certain conditions are imposed			1
" so the idea of the conference , of a meeting , in principle is a good one , " he told @entity76			0
" we will have to wait and see			0
" the @entity152 , the main rebel umbrella group , has demanded @entity16 step aside in order for it to take part in the talks , which were originally scheduled for this month			0
" it is difficult to continue when @entity2 are constantly being hammered by the @entity16 regime with the help of outside forces , " @entity157 , acting chairman of the @entity152 , said in a statement			1
he cited the siege of @entity164 and attacks on @entity166 , a suburb of @entity75 , as well as what he said was an " invasion " by @entity172 militia members in support of @entity16			0
@entity174 said it 's too early to discuss whether or not he 'll run again for president in the 2014 election			0
he 'd do so if " there is a need and public desire " for him to stay on , but wo n't " if i feel that the @entity2 people do not want me to lead them			2
" the @entity2 president his only condition is that anything agreed to address the crisis should not be binding until @entity2 approve it through a popular referendum			1
" either side can propose anything , but nothing can be implemented without the approval of the @entity2 people			2
and as long as we are the legitimate representatives of the people , we have nothing to fear , " the @entity2 leader said			2
