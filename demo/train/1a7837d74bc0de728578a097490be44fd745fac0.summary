@entity0 -- does part of social media 's future lie in the past ? it 's a question that 's nagging some of the biggest names in the industry as they turn their attention to the swelling digital archives many of us have created online			1
one of @entity14 's recent overhauls saw the addition of a timeline to help users build a chronological narrative of their lives			1
@entity20 , co-founder of photo sharing site @entity21 , said this week he wants to give his users better access to their older images			1
but as we increasingly rely on digital services as a repository for our life stories , is there any guarantee that we will be able to access them in years to come ? multibillion dollar businesses such as @entity14 and @entity34 might seem like rock solid cornerstones of the internet at the moment , but fortunes change and leviathans can and do go out of business			0
and a scroll through the fine print of most social media sites ' terms reveals no mention of an obligation to safeguard our data			1
with such a large question mark hanging over the tech industry , it was only a matter of time before someone smelled a business opportunity			0
one of those people is @entity56 , ceo of @entity57 , a service that allows users to archive images , documents and other data			1
@entity56 made headlines at tech conference @entity64 this week when he revealed that @entity57 has 34 million users , of whom 1.4 million are paying customers -- up sharply from the 25 million users and 1 million paying customers he had announced in may			1
three - quarters of these new users are coming from mobile devices , he said			0
already sitting on a $ 1 billion valuation , @entity56 's site -- often described as an " external brain " -- does n't look like it has any immediate worries for the future			1
there 's even talk of an @entity81 in the next few years			0
but @entity56 believes that he can encourage even more people to park their data with @entity57 if he can remove any question of doubt about his company 's long - term destiny			1
to this end , he plans to later this year introduce a legally binding promise that guarantees users 100 years of access to their files -- not that his customers will be around that long			0
this involves setting up a protected fund that , in the event of @entity57 being taken over or shut down , will pay to maintain its data banks			1
" we want people to have to believe that @entity57 will be around for 100 years , " @entity56 told @entity1			1
" as soon as 10 years go by when it has n't been in anyone 's economic interest to keep your data , you can almost be guaranteed you wo n't be able to get it back			2
but as long as it 's economical viable , it 'll remain alive			0
" eliminating this doubt makes smart business sense			0
some data services have endured a rocky ride because of fluctuating faith in their prospects			2
in 2010 , social bookmarking service @entity114 experienced a sharp user exodus after @entity117 announced it was selling off the site			2
@entity114 still exists today and may continue to thrive long into the future			0
but online - archiving services must establish trust with their users to endure , said @entity123 , founder of rival bookmarker @entity124			2
" an archive needs to have a credible plan for offering the same basic feature set over a time scale of decades , " @entity123 told the @entity126 conference in @entity127 earlier this year			2
in a world where computers and storage solutions are constantly evolving , such plans face hurdles			0
" the main technology challenge is what format will be available in 100 years ? " says @entity56			2
" it 's like people who had eight - track tapes of their favorite music from 30 years ago			0
who 's going to know how to play a cd in 10 or 20 years ? " there 's no magical technology solution -- it 's not like we have a file format that someone will be able to read in 100 years , " he added			0
" so we have to make it worth someone 's time to convert the data into whatever the newest format is			2
" @entity56 says his company is taking cues from the @entity157 , a private organization that is examining ways to preserve data for centuries as part of its broader efforts to promote debate over humankind 's distant legacy			1
" they 're planning for thousands of years , " he said			0
of course , no one knows exactly what the @entity169 will look like a century from now			0
but @entity56 , and @entity57 , are trying .			1

services such as @entity57 allow users to archive images , documents and other data
@entity57 hopes to be around a century from now , even if social media sites are not
