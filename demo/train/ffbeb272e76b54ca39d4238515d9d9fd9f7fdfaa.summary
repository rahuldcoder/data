@entity0 is tweeting that " we should not be importing to our homeland			0
" an @entity5 congressman is worried that refugee children from @entity7 could pose a public health risk with " @entity2 circulating			1
" and the @entity10 - sphere is filled with people asking " how can we bring these patients to @entity7 , " complaining that " we do n't have enough problems in @entity7 ! let 's import @entity2 patients ! " and speculating that treating them here is " highly irresponsible			1
" but the actual possibility of catching @entity2 is incredibly remote			1
it 's a terrifying disease for sure			0
it typically kills 90 % of the people who get it , and this most recent outbreak is the largest in history			2
but you do n't need to panic , experts say , and you definitely do n't have to worry about the two @entity28 @entity2 patients who are being treated in @entity29			1
here are five reasons why : 1			0
@entity2 is an incredibly fragile virus			1
it does not fly through the air with the greatest of ease			0
it can not be transmitted through a cough or sneeze			0
it does n't move easily from human to human like the common cold			0
@entity2 is aggressively infectious , so people who are infected are highly likely to get sick			1
but it 's not highly contagious			1
" the ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood , secretions or other body fluids of ill people and indirect contact -- for example , with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids , " said @entity41 , deputy director of the @entity43 's @entity42 and @entity44			1
that 's why health care providers who work in countries without proper protective gear can get it			0
that 's also why people preparing bodies for burial have gotten it			2
we know how it works			0
although there is no vaccine and no cure , the one real advantage we have with @entity2 is that doctors know how to control it			1
@entity2 is n't " some mystical pathogen ( with ) some bizarre mode of transmission , " said @entity78 , who oversees the special isolation unit that is treating the patients at @entity81			1
common - sense hygiene can stop its spread			0
" @entity2 is a virus that can be stopped and not spread in hospitals			1
the stakes are higher , but it 's easily inactivated with typical hospital disinfectants , " said @entity43 director @entity85			0
what to know about @entity2 3			2
we have the resources to contain it			0
the two @entity28 patients with @entity2 were flown to the @entity28 in a plane outfitted with an isolation pod			1
they are being kept in isolation at the @entity81 hospital with a specialized containment ward , one of four in the country			0
in the containment ward , the vents are specialized			0
there 's an intercom and plate glass that separates patients from visitors so they do n't come into direct contact			2
there 's a strict protocol on everyone and everything that goes into and out of the patient 's room			0
health care workers wear protective suits			0
but any major medical center could really take care of an @entity2 patient , said @entity119 , an expert on infectious diseases at @entity122 's @entity121			1
most icus have isolation rooms that are used for patients suspected to have tuberculosis , @entity127 , @entity129 respiratory syndrome or another infectious disease			2
@entity119 said that not much would be different for an @entity2 patient , though more stringent precautions might be taken to ensure that health care workers are following all protocols			2
our medical staff is ready			0
" we have been training for this , " @entity78 said of preparations for the two @entity28 @entity2 patients			1
these doctors know how to handle @entity2 and will use an abundance of caution when working with an infected person			1
medical workers across the country have also been told to watch out for @entity2 symptoms and question patients who have recently traveled to @entity149			1
they are trained to recognize @entity2 cases and can quarantine them early , keeping others from coming into contact with an infected person 's bodily fluids while the disease runs its course			1
9 questions about this new @entity2 drug 5			2
at @entity163 airports in the @entity2 - affected region , passengers are being closely screened			2
health experts are watching for people with high fevers			0
those who have a temperature are removed and monitored while doctors test their blood for @entity2			1
when passengers arrive at the airport , they are required to wash their hands in a chlorinated solution			0
customs agents and passport inspectors are also wearing surgical gloves when interacting with passengers			0
" there is always the possibility that someone with an infectious disease can enter the @entity28 , " @entity43 spokeswoman @entity178 said monday			1
" the public health concern is whether it would spread and , if so , how quickly			0
' " what is the risk of catching @entity2 on a plane ? at @entity28 airports , trained federal agents also watch for sick passengers			1
border patrol is asking about potential exposure			0
if someone is sick , agents can remove them and keep them in the special isolation units kept at many @entity28 airports until the @entity43 arrives to ask further questions			2
overall , health experts say , the threat to @entity28 remains relatively small			2
in the past decade , five people have entered the @entity28 known to have a viral hemorrhagic fever , including a case in march of a @entity204 man diagnosed with @entity206 fever after traveling to @entity149			1
no one else contracted the disease .			0

@entity2 is aggressively infectious ; it is not highly contagious
doctors know how it spreads and can keep contamination down
doctors have trained for years on how to handle these patients
in past decade , five people known to have viral hemorrhagic fever have entered @entity28
