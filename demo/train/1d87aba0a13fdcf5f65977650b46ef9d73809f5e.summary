@entity0 -- to this day , @entity2 recalls the shame she once felt for her great - uncle			1
@entity5 was convicted of transporting a white woman across state lines for " immoral purposes			1
" " i could see from the expression on my mother 's face that it pained her to tell me about him , " she recalled , " but it was n't just her			2
the shame was there for all the members of my family			2
" @entity21 's great - uncle , @entity5 , shocked the nation in 1908 by becoming the first @entity25 - @entity24 world heavyweight champion			1
yet the boxer was arrested not long afterward for taking a white woman across state lines for " immoral " purposes			1
that case fell apart and the woman later became his wife , but then investigators charged him with a similar offense involving a woman he had dated years earlier			1
an all - white jury 's decision to convict him in that case has come to be widely viewed as a symbol of racial injustice			2
now @entity21 is working with sen. @entity41 and others to try to clear her great - uncle 's name			2
@entity41 wants the @entity46 to pass a resolution urging president @entity48 to grant @entity5 a presidential pardon			1
it would represent a final vindication for @entity21 , a 53 - year - old seamstress in @entity52 who now views her great - uncle with pride			0
her parents did n't tell her until she was 12 that she was related to @entity5 , even though she saw his photo at school during lessons on black history			1
" i remember seeing his picture on the wall of my sixth - grade classroom in @entity52 in 1966 , " @entity21 said in a voice tinged with sadness			0
" it was up there next to pictures of @entity71 and @entity72 as part of a black history week my teacher put together			0
i did n't have the first clue who the man was			0
my parents did n't want me to know			0
" her parents , she said , were trying to protect her from a legacy of racial injustice at a time when the country had yet to emerge from the long shadow of segregation			0
@entity21 was stunned when she learned her great - uncle 's story			0
less than five years after winning the heavyweight title , @entity5 was convicted for violating the @entity90 , which outlawed the transportation of women across state lines for " immoral " purposes			1
@entity5 was black and the woman was white -- enough to get even a champion imprisoned in early 20th century @entity24			1
@entity98 lawyers decried it as a " crime against nature " for him to have a sexual relationship with a white woman			1
judge @entity103 , later to become the first commissioner of @entity105 , set @entity5 's bail at $ 30,000 -- the equivalent of more than $ 660,000 today			1
when a bail bondsman showed up , @entity103 jailed him , too , according to an account that filmmaker @entity110 relays in his documentary , " unforgivable blackness : the @entity113 of @entity5			1
" an all - white jury convicted @entity5 in less than two hours			1
" mr. @entity5 was perhaps persecuted as an individual , but ... it was his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the intermarriage of whites and blacks , " one of the prosecutors later said			1
@entity5 's real crime , in the eyes of many , was committed three years earlier , when he successfully defended his boxing title against @entity127 , a white boxer who came to be called the " @entity128 " because many white fans saw him as the best chance to wrest back a boxing title from the @entity25 - @entity24 champ			1
@entity127 , a former heavyweight champion , had come out of retirement intending to reclaim a title that many @entity24 believed @entity5 had no right to in the first place			1
@entity5 beat @entity127 on july 4 , 1910 , before a stunned , almost entirely white crowd in @entity138 , @entity139			1
more than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured			0
so when they " could n't beat him in the ring , the white power establishment decided to beat him in the courts , " @entity110 said in his documentary			2
@entity5 fled to @entity150 in 1913 while free on appeal			1
but after years of fights overseas -- including the eventual loss of his title in @entity155 , @entity156 , in 1915 -- @entity5 came home			1
he turned himself over to @entity24 authorities at the @entity160 border in 1920 and served ten months in prison			0
he died in a car wreck in 1946			0
" back then , if you were black and you were told that you did something wrong , you really had no recourse , " said @entity21			0
" you just accepted what was done because black people were basically powerless and voiceless			0
@entity5 may have been a rich boxer , but he could n't fight the system			1
" today , in a very different @entity24 , @entity21 's family is seeking justice			0
they 've teamed up with @entity110 , @entity41 and rep. @entity173 , a @entity175 @entity174 , to urge the nation 's first @entity25 - @entity24 president to grant @entity5 a rare posthumous pardon			1
@entity41 and @entity173 introduced resolutions calling for a presidential pardon in 2005 and last year			2
the @entity181 passed it , but the @entity46 did not			0
the @entity181 declined to comment when asked @entity48 's views on a possible pardon for @entity5			1
@entity41 , who says he made a mistake by once voting against a federal holiday for the rev. @entity187 , sees the pardon as a way to right an old wrong			2
" the @entity5 case is an ignominious stain on our nation 's history , " he said on the @entity46 floor this month , while introducing a new version of the resolution			1
" rectifying this injustice is long overdue			0
[ the resolution recognizes ] the unjustness of what transpired , and sheds light on the achievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice			0
@entity5 ... deserved much better than a racially motivated conviction			1
" @entity173 , himself a former boxer , said in a written statement that @entity5 was a trailblazer who became " a victim of the times			2
" for @entity21 , the proposed pardon is also personal			2
it 's about wiping the slate clean for future generations of her family			0
" my mother used to say @entity5 was defiant , " she remembered			2
" no disrespect , momma , but he was being his own man			0
and i 'm so proud of him			0
to think -- of all the families in the world , @entity227 gave him to us			0
" @entity21 has made sure her four children know the story of the country 's first black heavyweight champion			2
" they love him , " she said			0
" especially my oldest son			0
he was a bit of a pugilist in high school			0
he got into his fair share of scraps			0
i think we know where he got that trait			0
" @entity21 says she 'll go to @entity0 if @entity48 issues a pardon			1
with a bit of laughter , she promises to give a gracious , eloquent speech thanking him			0
with or without a pardon , she emphasizes , the stigma and the shame are gone			2
today , @entity5 's family feels only pride .			2
