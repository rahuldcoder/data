the @entity4 spy @entity2 may routinely get himself out of dangerous situations with skill and charm , but his body may be suffering all the while because of his drinking habits			1
@entity4 researchers predict he could die from alcohol - related causes , such as liver damage , by age 56			1
scientists wanted to examine just how much alcohol the famous fictional secret agent consumes , and what effect that could have on his health			0
they published a study , led by @entity22 of the emergency department of @entity24 , in the @entity27 's @entity26 edition , which features a variety of offbeat research papers			0
researchers found @entity2 's weekly alcohol consumption totaled 92 units a week , which is more than four times what doctors recommend			1
a real person would not be able to carry out such complicated tasks and function as well as @entity2 does while maintaining such habits , they conclude			2
a unit of alcohol is defined as 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure ethanol in the @entity4			0
for some perspective on that , a bottle of wine is nine units , and a pint of beer is three , according to this study			0
the finding of 92 units a week could actually be the low end of the truth , as studies have shown that " people generally underestimate their alcohol consumption by about 30 % , " the study said , noting other research has demonstrated that health surveys do n't account for about half of all alcohol sold			2
in other words , @entity2 may be drinking much more than the large quantities portrayed in the books			2
" we advise an immediate referral for further assessment and treatment , " the study authors wrote , as well as " a reduction in alcohol to safe levels			2
" 10 hotels featured in @entity2 movies two study authors analyzed all 14 original @entity2 books by @entity76 , focusing on the number of days on which alcohol - related events were described			1
but each of them only read half the books , representing a shortcoming of the study , which was conducted in " the study authors ' homes , in a comfy chair			0
" they found that in " from @entity88 with @entity89 , " on the third day of the story , @entity2 drank about 50 units of alcohol -- the highest daily consumption in the collection of stories			1
it also appears that the spy 's alcohol intake dropped around the middle of his career , but then picked back up gradually toward the end			0
" this consistent but variable lifetime drinking pattern has been reported in patients with alcoholic liver disease , " study authors wrote			0
note that researchers did not analyze the @entity2 films , only the books , so the precise level of alcoholism that @entity2 portrays on the big screen is an open question			1
@entity2 50th anniversary coverage about 2.5 million deaths worldwide are attributable to alcohol use , the study said			1
the cause of alcohol - related death is most often injury , liver cirrhosis , poisoning and malignancy			0
a real person who drank as much as @entity2 , more than 60 grams of alcohol per day , would be in the highest risk group for malignancies , depression , hypertension and cirrhosis and could also suffer sexual dysfunction			1
early death would be likely for the spy as a result of such rampant alcohol consumption , researchers said			2
@entity76 , the author who created the @entity2 character , and frequently drank and smoked tobacco , died at age 56 of heart disease			1
" we suspect that @entity2 's life expectancy would be similar , " the researchers wrote			1
alcoholism may even be responsible for @entity2 's famous catchphrase " vodka martini -- shaken , not stirred			2
" this may have health - related implications , too			0
study authors posit that if @entity2 's alcohol consumption in the books is so chronic and excessive , he may be suffering from an alcohol - induced tremor			1
chronic exposure to alcohol can damage a part of the brain called the cerebellum , which can lead to a tremor			0
this suggests -- and of course , this is only speculation -- that perhaps @entity2 ca n't actually stir his drinks			0
@entity2 submarine car sells for $ 920,000 is @entity2 the man with the golden liver ? " in @entity168 he drinks over 39 units before engaging in a high - speed car chase , losing control , and spending 14 days in hospital , " study authors wrote			1
" we hope that this was a salutatory lesson			0
" and yet , @entity2 kept drinking in subsequent novels			2
there 's plenty of opportunity for another installment : " from @entity180			0

study looked at 14 @entity2 novels
about 2.5 million deaths worldwide are attributable to alcohol use
researchers project @entity2 could die at age 56 because of alcohol use
