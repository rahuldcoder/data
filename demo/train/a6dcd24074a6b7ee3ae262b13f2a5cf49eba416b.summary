star @entity2 linebacker @entity1 -- just 43 years old when he took his own life last may -- suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a neurodegenerative brain disease that can follow multiple hits to the head , the @entity0 said thursday			1
questions of @entity10 came up immediately after @entity1 's body was found , with a handgun nearby , in the bedroom of his home in @entity15 , @entity16			1
@entity10 can result in @entity17 's - like symptoms such as dementia , memory loss , aggression and depression , but it can be diagnosed only after death			1
in a statement issued thursday , @entity1 's family said , " while the @entity0 's findings have provided a measure of comfort , we remain heartbroken that @entity1 is no longer with us , and are deeply saddened to receive confirmation that he suffered from such a debilitating condition			1
" @entity1 was a loving father , teammate and committed member of his community , " the statement continued			2
" that is how we will always remember him			0
" seau 's death adds to dark legacy of championship team @entity1 's family donated his brain to the @entity0 for research , and thursday the @entity0 released a statement saying " abnormalities were found that are consistent with a form of ( @entity10 )			1
" according to the pathology report from the @entity0 , five researchers -- two @entity0 neuropathologists and three independent experts -- examined slides of @entity1 's brain and all confirmed that there were signs consistent with @entity10			1
none of the researchers was aware of the identity of the brain when initially looking at it			0
in a recent study , researchers found @entity10 in 34 of 35 deceased @entity2 players whose brains were donated by family members			1
dr. @entity65 , the director of neuropathology at @entity67 and a co-author of that study , says the @entity10 diagnosis in the @entity1 case was not unexpected			1
" from what i 've read about the symptoms ( @entity1 ) was experiencing the last couple of years -- the ones relayed by the family -- it is not surprising to me that he had this disease , " said @entity65 , who was not involved in the @entity1 case			1
" it does n't sound like it was early @entity10 , that it was becoming quite widespread in the brain			1
and he was young at the time of death			0
it is another sad day to see another fairly well - established case of @entity10			1
" a brain with @entity10 is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau			1
under a microscope , tau appears as brown tangles similar to dementia			0
however , the @entity95 study showed this progressive , tau protein array in football players much too young for a dementia diagnosis , which typically occurs in people in their 70s or 80s			0
opinion : seau was hurting , and did n't know how to say it what may be a surprise to some is that @entity1 was never diagnosed with a concussion in all the years he played football			2
that points to the bigger mysteries of the disease that scientists such as dr. @entity113 , the co-director of the @entity114 , hope to someday solve			0
" it is not unprecedented that he did n't have a concussion history			0
that 's part of the problem in figuring this out , " @entity113 said			0
" it seemed logical at first that it would be people with multiple concussions that would be at risk of @entity10			2
as we 've learned more , it was surprising that some of those at risk for @entity10 were players who did not have a history of concussion			2
" seau was one of a string of high - profile @entity2 players -- along with @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 -- who took their own lives and were later diagnosed with @entity10			1
not everyone who is exposed to repeated head trauma would develop the disease , experts say			0
" based on what we know thus far , i think we have to assume that the @entity150 risk factor we have is the degree or extent of exposure , " @entity113 said			0
" and if anyone had high exposure , if there was anyone you 'd worry about , it 'd be @entity1			2
he played for 30 years			0
he played youth football , college football , for 20 years in the @entity2			2
" the @entity2 responded to the announcement of @entity1 's diagnosis with a statement saying , " we appreciate the @entity167 's cooperation with the @entity0			1
the finding underscores the recognized need for additional research to accelerate a fuller understanding of @entity10			2
" the @entity172 issued a statement calling on @entity174 to review the issues of health and safety in football , mentioning the $ 100 million it set aside of player funds for medical research during the term of the current collective bargaining agreement			0
the @entity172 also said it has asked the league for independent sideline concussion experts , the certification and credentialing of professional football medical staff and better worker 's compensation			0
" the only way we can improve the safety of players , restore the confidence of our fans and secure the future of our game is to insist on the same quality of medical care , informed consent and ethical standards that we expect for ourselves and for our family members , " the statement said .			0
