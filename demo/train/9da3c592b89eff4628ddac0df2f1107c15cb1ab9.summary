the cost of fighting climate change will only climb if industrialized nations do n't take steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , the @entity3 ' panel on the matter warned sunday in its wrap - up report			1
in its " synthesis report , " the @entity9 said that the hundreds of authors involved in the study were even more certain than before that the planet is warming and humans are the cause			1
" if left unchecked , climate change will increase the likelihood of severe , pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems , " the report said			1
@entity3 @entity21 ban ki - moon told reporters that action must come soon			1
time is not on our side , " he said			1
the report said there are solutions to keeping the rise in temperatures from crossing a 2 - degree celsius increase , the goal of many governments			1
" it is technically feasible to transition to a low - carbon economy , " said @entity37 , the co-chairman of @entity38 " but what is lacking are appropriate policies and institutions			2
the longer we wait to take action , the more it will cost to adapt and mitigate climate change			2
" previously the group has said that about half of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age has been produced since 1990			2
on the current path , global average temperatures could go up anywhere from 3.7 to 4.8 degrees c ( 6.7 to 8.6 f ) over pre-industrial levels by 2100			1
according to the @entity9 , to stay below a 2 - degree c increase , greenhouse gas emissions need to fall as much as 70 % around the world by 2050 and to zero by 2100			1
@entity62 secretary of state @entity61 said the report is " another canary in the coal mine " and added that " ambitious , decisive and immediate action " is needed			1
" we have that opportunity , and the choice is in our hands , " @entity67 , chairman of the group , said in the report			1
@entity74 , a weather forecaster and a founder of the @entity76 , said climate change is " not happening			2
" " there is no significant man - made global warming now			2
there has n't been any in the past , and there 's no reason to expect any in the future , " @entity74 told @entity85 's " @entity84			2
" @entity74 said governments pay scientists to study the issue and researchers reach expected conclusions in order to continue to receive funding			0
therefore the large percentage of climate scientists who agree there is climate change is a " manipulated figure , " he said			0
" they do n't have any choice , " added @entity74 , who said he is a skeptic , not a denier			0
" if you 're going to get the money , you have got to support their position			0
" but @entity107 , ceo of the @entity76 , said @entity74 's opinion is at odds with the channel 's stance , which he said has been " unwavering " since 2007			0
the @entity76 's statement says that the @entity113 is indeed warming and cites " strong evidence that the majority of the warming over the past century is a result of human activities			0
" @entity76 distances itself from a founder " the science is really clear , and i do n't like our brand being associated with something that 's not scientifically based , " @entity107 told " @entity84 , " adding that @entity74 has n't been associated with the channel in decades			0
the chief scientist at the @entity127 's @entity126 said the @entity9 report gives governments the science to help make policy decisions			1
@entity132 added that supercomputing will also advance the science			0
" by doing this we can provide a solid evidence base to ensure @entity127 investment decisions , and our future prosperity , remain resilient to future climate risk , " she said in a written statement			0
the report did n't estimate a price for global changes			2
" @entity146 finds that mitigation cost estimates vary , but that global economic growth would not be strongly affected , " it said			0
@entity149 said it is a myth that fixing climate change will be expensive			0
inaction will have large financial and societal costs , he said			0
he pointed to renewable energy and increased efficiency as two ways to address the issue			0
the @entity9 said the report is based on 30,000 scientific papers studied by about 830 authors and 2,000 reviewers			1
the reports from the @entity9 are aimed at guiding world leaders as the @entity3 attempts to work out a new treaty to limit emissions			1
@entity166 will host the next major international climate summit , scheduled to start november 30 , 2015			0
previous rounds of talks have been strained by disputes between the biggest emitters -- @entity173 , the @entity62 and @entity174 countries -- and poorer countries whose populations could see the worst impacts first .			1

@entity3 @entity21 says time is running out for world leaders to lead
report is " another canary in the coal mine , " @entity62 secretary of state @entity61 says
@entity3 calls for the *elimination* of greenhouse gas emissions by 2100
@entity9 says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing temperature rises
