-- @entity1 lifted state of emergency laws wednesday that had allowed for a crackdown on political leaders and journalists , but at the same time continued its crackdown on the country 's major @entity9 political opposition movement and stifled the latest street protests			1
it filed charges against four top opposition leaders in a move that could weaken the country 's @entity17 party , according to two opposition sources			1
this came as @entity21 appealed for dialogue , saying that talks with opposition groups are scheduled to begin in july			1
the lifting of the emergency laws , imposed in mid-march , is thought to be an effort to signal an end to months of civil unrest stemming from the @entity30 , a wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in @entity32 and have since roiled several countries in the @entity34 and @entity35 , including @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity1			1
but the announcement by the country 's @entity40 followed one from the justice ministry the day before warning against " any type of activities that could affect the security or harm the national peace and safety			2
" meanwhile , protesters gathered across @entity1 , in locations including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , according to @entity58 , a prominent @entity1 human rights activist			2
@entity58 said peaceful protesters were attacked by security forces with tear gas and rubber bullets , causing injuries but no deaths			0
the demonstrations were dispersed soon after they started , he said			0
the country is set to hold parliamentary elections in september , filling seats vacated by members of @entity17 , which left parliament in protest over the crackdown			1
the military prosecutor in @entity1 on tuesday summoned four top @entity17 leaders and presented them with charges that could result in prison terms , the two opposition sources told @entity0			1
the sources did n't know what the charges were			2
it is not clear whether those opposition leaders will be permitted to take part in the september elections			1
if someone faces charges , they ca n't run for election or travel out of the country			2
the four are sheikh @entity90 , @entity17 's leader , @entity92 , the leader of @entity17 's parliament bloc , @entity94 , who once was deputy leader of that bloc , and another lawmaker whose identity was not available			2
two other @entity17 members had already been detained and another is out of the country			1
one of the two is @entity103			0
@entity1 said he is being detained based on evidence provided to the courts , but one of his relatives told @entity0 that family members are not aware of any charges against @entity103			1
protesters initially took to the streets of @entity112 , the capital , to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy			0
but some have called for the removal of the royal family that has led the @entity120 state since the 18th century			0
young members of the country 's @entity9 majority have staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination , unemployment and corruption , issues they say the country 's @entity130 rulers have done little to address			0
the government has since come under intense criticism by human rights groups over its detentions			0
also last week , @entity1 said it had released 515 detainees imprisoned since the state of emergency went into effect			1
it is unclear how many people were in custody			0
last week , the @entity142 pulled its human rights officer from the @entity144 in @entity1 after he became the target of a harassment campaign that senior @entity142 officials say appears to have been fanned by some hard - line members of the government			2
@entity152 was for months the subject of threats and anti-semitic slurs on a pro-government website and in state - sanctioned newspapers , the officials said			0
@entity152 was scheduled to leave the country this summer , as his tour of duty was coming to a close			0
but senior @entity142 officials said the embassy sent him home several weeks early over concern for his safety .			0
