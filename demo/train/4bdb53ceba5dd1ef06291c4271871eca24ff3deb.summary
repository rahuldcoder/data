@entity0 -- on the northern edge of this war - torn country , barely 100 meters from the @entity3 border , thousands of desperate @entity0 slept in the dirt			1
they were hard to spot at first , hidden among ancient olive groves			2
but as the sun rose , bodies stirred beneath filthy blankets , next to pitiable shelters of plastic sheets strung up between olive trees			1
children began scavenging in surrounding fields for twigs to use for cooking fires			0
women lined up next to a water tank pumping milky , chalky water presumed to have given many residents of this make - shift camp diarrhea			0
a month ago , there was no camp here			0
but now rebels from a local @entity29 group that slept in a tent with the words " police office " spray - painted on it estimated there were between 5,500 and 6,000 people living here , with more arriving every day			2
more : @entity37 marks highest daily death toll " i came here because my house was destroyed , " said @entity39 , an @entity40 - speaking 30 - year - old man who said he used to manage a @entity42 restaurant in @entity43			0
" i never imagined in all my life to come here and live under the olive trees			0
" many of the residents told similar stories of rockets and airstrikes pummeling their villages and towns , forcing them to flee their homes			0
@entity57 sat on a plastic mat under a tree holding his 2 - year - old daughter , @entity60			0
long , wide scars stretched across her chest , still pink from the explosion last month that left her badly burned			0
" i do n't know what exploded , whether it was a rocket or a bomb , " @entity57 said			2
the blast destroyed his home in the battleground city of @entity43 , in a flashpoint neighborhood called @entity73			0
when a reporter asked " how are you ? " in @entity77 to @entity60 , she did n't respond			2
@entity57 explained that the explosion left the little girl deaf			0
in his other arm , he held @entity60 's one - and - a - half - month old brother , whose face was covered with insect bites			2
" he 's being bitten by mosquitoes , and he has diarrhea and fever , " @entity57 said , adding that he and his family of eight had already spent more than two weeks waiting here by the border for the @entity3 to let them in			1
" every day that we stay here we come closer to dying			0
" for more than a year , @entity3 maintained what it described as an " open door policy " for @entity0 refugees fleeing their government 's military assaults			1
@entity3 border guards met families who escaped to the border fence with vans and buses that transported them to camps that foreign dignitaries have frequently described as clean , well - managed and orderly			1
more : witness says scores killed in massacre south of @entity107 but over the last month , the refugee population in @entity3 has swelled to more than 87,000 people , prompting @entity110 to at least partially shut its " open door " policy as the @entity3 government struggles to build more camps			1
" our speed of constructing camps ... can not compete with the pace of the violence of the @entity124 regime against its own people , " said @entity3 foreign ministry spokesman @entity115 , in a phone interview with @entity1			1
" there is no policy change , " another @entity3 official insisted , speaking on condition of anonymity			1
" we intend to continue this policy of open door as long as we can			0
the thing is , our capabilities are being strained			0
" " we 've started to extend humanitarian aid , food , medicine , to the zero point on the border , " the official added			1
" that 's the best we can do at the moment			2
" there were signs of food distribution and delivery of basic supplies at the olive orchard camp			0
but no international aid organizations appeared to have a presence here			0
as parents have watched their children succumb to disease due to the filthy conditions , tempers have periodically flared			1
" i 'm ready to beg ( @entity3 prime minister @entity160 ) @entity160 to help us , " said a man dressed in a track suit who called himself @entity159			1
he showed a laminated card that identified him as an @entity29 fighter			0
but @entity159 explained he quit the rebel movement after his wife was killed by a government airstrike last month			0
now the former rebel was trying to transport his surviving children to safety in @entity3			1
an hour later , @entity159 led a procession of about 100 men and boys past piles of burning garbage , to the barbed wire border fence			2
there , under the eyes of @entity3 gendarme officers watching from a guard tower that overlooked the camp , the refugees held a futile protest , begging the @entity3 to let them in			1
" @entity160 , @entity160 , today we sleep in @entity3 , " the crowd chanted			1
more : report details @entity0 children 's horror stories " we want to send a message to the leaders of the @entity192 world , of the @entity194 world , they abandoned us , " @entity159 yelled			1
" and the first one who let us down was @entity196			0
" as the crowd chanted , a lone @entity3 municipal employee worked a few meters away on the @entity3 side of the fence , spreading mortar onto a recently constructed cinder block wall			1
in the @entity0 village below the camp , hundreds of other displaced families had taken shelter in schools and a village mosque			1
there were new arrivals every day			0
a pickup truck loaded with at least 30 people and their belongings rolled up outside of one of the schools wednesday			2
a woman who only gave the name @entity216 said this was n't the first time her family vacated their homes in the village of @entity222 , near the city of @entity224			2
" we fled our homes many times before to neighboring villages , " she said , still sitting in the back of the loaded truck			2
" but now we ca n't stay there ... the situation is very , very bad			1
@entity232 and bombs , falling day and night			0
" @entity216 's family also wanted to go to @entity3			1
since @entity3 authorities were only allowing a few hundred refugees to enter every day , some @entity0 resorted to desperate tactics to escape their country			1
under the cover of pre-dawn darkness , a family of at least 10 stood quietly in fields not far from the @entity3 border fence			1
with a signal from a smuggler , they then walked single - file toward the border , carrying suitcases and bags on their heads			2
the family then began crawling , one by one , through the barbed wire fence			0
suddenly , flashlights flared in the darkness			0
a squad of @entity3 gendarme soldiers ran along the fence toward the refugees , bellowing at the top of their lungs			1
moments later , the family members came stumbling back to @entity0 , still clutching their suitcases			1
for now , there would be no escape			0
