@entity0 -- a year ago , @entity2 announced the @entity3 , the next generation of its massively popular gaming system that incorporates a handheld controller with its own video screen into play with the more traditional @entity3 console			1
on tuesday , at the world 's largest video - game gathering , the company was still explaining it -- and not sparing any superlatives in doing so			2
" it changes your gaming			0
it changes how you interact with your gaming friends			0
and it changes the way you enjoy your tv , " said @entity19 , president and ceo of @entity2			2
" it 's not just intuitive , not just accessible to everyone , but it stands to revolutionize your living room			0
" having showcased the @entity3 hardware at last year 's @entity29 , the focus at tuesday 's @entity2 event was on games : 23 of them , to be exact			1
they ranged from " @entity35 , " the inevitable arrival of @entity2 's most enduring and beloved character , to " @entity34 : @entity38 , " a new take on the popular action franchise			1
but while the titles were plentiful , the real focus was on how the @entity3 will make them different			1
at the forefront is what the company is calling " asymmetric game play			0
" what that means is that a player using the system 's new handheld controller -- it looks like a tablet computer , with a screen and buttons -- can share the same game with other players who are using traditional keypads			1
but that player 's objectives and experience will be different than the others			0
" the player with the game pad takes on a special role , " said @entity64 , the developer of " @entity65 , " a game that will combine characters and settings from 12 @entity2 titles into one " greatest hits " game			1
" it 's playing the same game world as the other players , but with a different perspective , different information and a completely different role			2
" in one of those mini-games , " @entity85 , " up to four players using traditional controllers play as ghost hunters , while another with one of the new game pads is the ghost			0
the " ghost " sees more than the other players on the pad 's video screen and plays against the others			2
in turning to @entity64 to create " @entity65 , " the company is hoping to answer any lingering questions about whether the @entity3 is simply a handheld gaming device attached to a @entity3			1
he developed " @entity101 , " the game the company credits with most clearly and easily showcasing what the @entity3 could do when it was released six years ago			1
" for @entity3 , ' @entity65 ' does the same thing , " @entity19 said			0
" play it , and you begin to understand			0
" the game will be released at the same time as the @entity3 this holiday season , @entity19 said			1
no price for the system has been announced			0
the @entity2 event marked the second straight day that one of the three major gaming console makers used the big stage of @entity29 to focus on " second screen " gaming			0
on monday , @entity113 unveiled its @entity115 system , which lets players use their tablets or smartphones in conjunction with its @entity120			0
other titles announced for the system included " @entity123 , " a new version of the exercise program that has sold more than 43 million copies ; " sing , " a karaoke game that lets players user the new game pad to read lyrics ; and , in a nod to hard - core gamers , " @entity133 , " the latest in the acclaimed role playing - game series			1
on its @entity138 feed , game creator @entity135 noted that the title represents its debut on the @entity3 and that the game will be available when the @entity3 launches			1
but " @entity133 " and " @entity34 " were n't enough to please some hard - core gamers , many of whom are down on @entity2 for what they see as its focus on games geared toward a more casual , family - friendly audience			1
" i 'm not really sure what @entity2 wants to be ... , " said @entity150 , host of @entity152 's x-play			2
" @entity2 has abandoned the core gaming audience even though they like to pretend they 're not			0
" for the handheld @entity158 , the company announced upcoming titles , including " @entity160 : @entity161 " and " @entity162 : @entity163			2

@entity2 rolls out 23 titles for the upcoming @entity3
system 's handheld game pad offers different perspectives
new " @entity35 , " " @entity34 " and " @entity133 " titles are *planned*
@entity3 is expected to be released this holiday season
