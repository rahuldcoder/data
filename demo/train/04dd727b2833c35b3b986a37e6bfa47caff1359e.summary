@entity6 has signed a $ 550 million contract for the delivery of three dozen such planes , @entity14 said			2
still , it was not clear whether the official was saying @entity6 would discontinue the delivery of all arms , or whether it was stopping just the supply of " new weapons			1
" the report seemed to leave open the possibility that @entity6 could continue to deliver some arms to @entity8 under existing contracts			1
the move could be a major blow to @entity8 president @entity38 , who is fighting to stay in control after more than a year of popular protests and a brutal government crackdown			2
@entity6 has been the long - time principal supplier of arms to @entity8 since the days when it was the @entity44			1

@entity48 secretary of state @entity47 said last month the continued supply of arms from @entity6 has strengthened @entity38 's regime , despite denials by @entity6 president @entity53 that any munitions it was providing to @entity8 were being used against its own people			1
also last month , a shipment of refurbished @entity6 helicopters headed for @entity8 had to turn around and return to @entity6 after its @entity60 insurance company dropped coverage on the ship carrying the helicopters			2
news of the suspended shipments comes the same day the joint @entity68 - @entity67 envoy to @entity8 said @entity38 has agreed on " an approach " to ending the bloodshed in @entity8			1
@entity71 made the statement after meeting with @entity38 in @entity73			2
he then flew to @entity74 for meetings with @entity77 leaders about the @entity8 conflict			2
@entity71 gave no details of the " approach " @entity38 agreed to but said he vowed to share it with the " armed opposition			1
" @entity71 also said @entity38 " reassured me of the government 's commitment " to @entity71 's six - point peace plan , brokered in march , which has done nothing to stop the deadly violence			1
@entity8 said the two men discussed a recent gathering of world leaders in @entity91 , @entity92 , aimed at taking steps to bring peace to @entity8 , " with emphasis on the need for dialogue to be among @entity8 and led by @entity8 " -- a phrase emphasizing @entity8 's resistance to foreign intervention of any sort in the conflict			0
later , @entity71 announced he was in @entity74 " to discuss the situation in @entity8 " and " to see how we can work together to help settle the situation			1
" @entity77 's state - run @entity106 said he planned to " hold talks with senior officials			0
" even as @entity71 was in @entity8 , @entity38 's regime reported it had conducted live - fire training exercises that simulated a defense against foreign attacks			1
throughout the 16 - month uprising , the regime has blamed violence on armed terrorist groups involving people from outside @entity8			2
at least 41 people were killed monday as the @entity8 regime continued its crackdown , according to the @entity122 opposition group			2
it said at least 60 people were killed in fighting sunday			0
monday 's violence included house - to - house raids and arrests in @entity128 and " very intense shelling " in @entity130 , with helicopters flying overhead , the @entity122 said			0
eighteen of the deaths were in @entity133 , the @entity122 said			0
gruesome video from the town of @entity136 in @entity133 showed blood - soaked bodies being dumped onto pickup trucks amid apparent destruction			0
a man is heard yelling , " @entity143 " ( " @entity144 is great " ) and calling the dead " victims of the indiscriminate shelling			0
" as with so many other videos that have emerged from the conflict , it was impossible to know the full story behind the images			0
heavy gunfire also erupted monday in the northern @entity151 state of @entity154 near the border with @entity8 , the official @entity151 news agency reported			1
a number of shells fell inside @entity151 territory , it said			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of violence as @entity8 has severely limited the access of international journalists			0
@entity8 state - run tv , meanwhile , broadcast what it called " confessions of four terrorists who admitted to committing murder , rape , abduction and robbery , in addition to smuggling weapons and gunmen , in @entity130 ' countryside			2
" the so - called confessions aired sunday , state - run news agency @entity176 reported monday			1
it said one of the terrorists " started off by being part of a group that attempted to incite people to protest , and his job was to transport protesters from mosques to squares in the town of @entity187			0
" @entity176 reported that on monday , authorities " clashed with an armed terrorist group " on the outskirts of @entity192			0
the @entity68 says more than 10,000 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in the violence in @entity8			0
opposition groups give an even higher figure			0
the violence erupted in march 2011 when @entity8 forces launched a brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrations , part of the @entity203 that swept through several countries			0
while members of the @entity206 , which includes the @entity48 , have called for an end to the violence and for @entity38 to step aside , efforts to adopt a resolution that would allow for aid to the rebels have been blocked by @entity6 and @entity213 , key @entity8 trade partners			1
