-- april 14 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity12 , @entity13 : in honor of @entity16 , i 'm here with @entity0 's library team ...			1
@entity12 , @entity13 : today 's show goes out to all of our @entity0 librarians and to all of you librarians and media specialists out there			1
now , let 's get to the headlines			1
first up : @entity29 @entity30 : first up , president @entity31 announces the details of his plan to lower the country 's deficit			1
it includes a mixture of spending cuts and tax increases			0
the @entity40 says the president 's plan will cut the deficit by $ 4 trillion over the next 12 years			1
@entity44 have outlined their own plan			1
it would cut about the same amount from the deficit , but in very different ways			1
@entity44 leaders have criticized the president 's plan , especially the idea of increasing government revenue by raising taxes on wealthy @entity55			1
house speaker @entity57 says the government does n't have a revenue problem , it has a spending problem			0
during his speech yesterday , president @entity31 said he does n't expect everyone to agree , but he does hope they can find a way to work together			1
@entity55 president @entity31 : i do n't expect the details in any final agreement to look exactly like the approach i laid out today			1
this is a democracy ; it 's not how things work			2
i 'm eager to hear other ideas from all ends of the political spectrum			0
and though i 'm sure the criticism of what i 've said here today will be fierce in some quarters , and my critique of the @entity40 @entity44 approach has been strong , @entity55 deserve and will demand that we all make an effort to bridge our differences and find common ground			1
is this legit ? @entity84 , @entity13 : is this legit ? the @entity89 word " fauna " refers to a region 's plant life			1
not true ! " @entity93 " refers to a region 's natural plant life while " fauna " refers to animal life			1
@entity94 @entity30 : there 's a new report out looking at the status of the fauna from the @entity55 @entity5 region			1
one year after the devastating @entity102 oil spill , the @entity100 classifies the coast 's wetlands as " poor			2
" some of the problems were around before the spill : erosion , storms			0
but the spill -- the worst in @entity55 history -- made the situation worse			1
according to the report , around 3,000 miles of coast were contaminated by oil			0
and even the clean - up efforts can cause damage			0
as for the animals that call the area home , sea turtles and bluefin tuna were some of the species that were hit pretty hard			0
they were both given a condition of " poor			0
" it 's not all bad news , though			1
@entity127 pelicans and dolphins in the @entity5 both have a " good " status			1
and the report says shrimp are recovering fairly well , too			0
gas prices & politics @entity30 : drive past a gas station and you might just wince			1
gas prices are high , and they keep going up ! the national average for a gallon of regular unleaded was $ 3.81 yesterday			1
that is an increase of 24 percent from the start of this year			2
@entity143 is going to explain what 's behind the rising prices and their impact on the political world			1
( begin video ) @entity149 , @entity0 correspondent : @entity151 , from @entity152 to @entity153 to @entity154 , consumers are getting socked by high gas prices			1
@entity156 : $ 4.19 a gallon , that 's ridiculous			2
@entity160 : i have to drive , and they do n't pay mileage			0
so , it 's really , really sticking me			2
@entity156 : you know , they 're getting all the bailouts and the breaks , and we 're getting squeezed			0
@entity156 : it 's @entity171 , so it 's even worse			2
@entity173 : why are oil prices shooting upward now ? the fighting in @entity176 is one contributing factor			2
fears of unrest spreading to other countries in the @entity181 , including @entity182 , also has markets on edge			0
and , economists say , factoring in speculation and an increase in demand from countries like @entity190			2
higher gas prices hit consumers where it hurts most : discretionary spending			1
@entity196 , economics professor , @entity198 : consumers really feel a pinch			0
they are limited in their discretion because they have to pay their mortgage , they have to pay their utilities			0
so , to pay higher gas prices , they go out to dinner less , they go to movies less , they buy fewer clothes			1
the amount of money that most consumers have to work with is very limited			0
@entity173 : gas prices are expected to continue to rise through the spring			1
the spike in prices is not just a pocketbook issue , it 's also a political one			1
@entity215 , @entity216 : there is not a lot of evidence that anything that political leaders are doing in the short term has as much impact on gas prices as market trends or long - term energy policy			1
but that does n't stop politicians of both parties from pointing the finger at each other			0
@entity173 : the issue is already playing out like a campaign ad			0
@entity44 are blaming president @entity31			1
democrats pushing back , pointing to @entity44 ' cozy ties with the oil and gas industry			2
( @entity237 ) teens and music @entity30 : you 've probably heard this before : music is one of those things that can define a generation			0
but new research suggests that the music you 're listening to might also define your state of mind			0
this study looked at teens who listen to a lot of music			0
by a lot , we mean four to five hours a day			0
and the research says those teens may be at a higher risk for depression			0
scientists also looked into other forms of media			0
teens who read more have a lower risk of depression			0
and tv does n't seem to have much of an effect			0
the study 's author recognized that some teens might use music for comfort			2
so , it raises the question : do people listen to more music when they 're sad ? or can listening to a lot of music lead you to be sad ? @entity278 @entity30 : you know this is something we 're talking about on our blog at @entity283			0
when we get a story like this one , that 's really about you , we want to know what you think			2
when you 're feeling down , do you find that listening to music is more helpful or harmful ? put some thought into it , let us know your opinions			2
this day in history @entity30 : it 's april 14th , and on this day in history : in 1828 , after more than two decades of work , @entity294 published the first edition of his @entity55 dictionary			1
in 1865 , president @entity298 was shot by @entity299 while attending a play at @entity301			2
@entity298 died the following morning			0
and in 1986 , the @entity55 launched air strikes against @entity176			1
this was in response to @entity176 supporting terrorism against @entity55 troops and citizens			1
before we go @entity30 : another event happened on this day in history back in 1910 : president @entity311 threw out the first ball at the @entity314 ' home opener			2
with that flick of the wrist , he started the tradition of presidents tossing out the first pitch			0
some of them threw from the stands , some from the mound			0
as we look back at this century - old tradition before we go today , see how many of these presidential pitchers you can recognize			2
( begin video ) [ @entity328 ; @entity329 ] ( @entity237 ) goodbye @entity30 : i pitched the idea of getting in a few throws here in the studio , but my producer balked at the idea			0
so instead , we 'll toss it to your teachers and strike up another edition of @entity0 tomorrow			0
hope y'all have a great day .			0
