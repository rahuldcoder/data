-- winter - weary residents in the @entity2 are bracing for yet another blow this week , compliments of a system that spent sunday pounding those in and around @entity7 with high winds and heavy snow			1
the @entity11 capital had already gotten over 8 inches of snow by 5:30 p.m. mt ( 7:30 p.m. et )			1
the snow socked the city 's main airport , where more than 200 of 1,500 flights had been canceled and other travelers faced average delays of more than 4 hours on sunday night , according to the @entity19			1
even more snow had fallen in other places , including 19 inches in @entity22 , about 70 miles southwest of @entity7			1
by sunday night , the worst was over for much of @entity11 , though not for points east , which are expected to be hammered to start the workweek			1
that includes several @entity2 , which are already reeling from a dizzying few days of harsh winter weather			1
last thursday , for instance , a storm dumped up to 22 inches of snow on parts of @entity32			1
two days later , @entity33 said her street in @entity35 , @entity32 , still had n't been plowed , making it impossible for her to take her husband to his doctor 's appointments or visit her son at the hospital			2
" if we have an emergency or a fire , the rescue ca n't come down here			0
so what are we to do , " @entity33 told @entity0 affiliate @entity46			0
" ... it just does n't make any sense			0
" she got some relief when plow trucks finally hit the roads around her home later saturday , but it wo n't last long			2
that city is expecting 9 to 15 inches of snow monday night into tuesday			1
forecasters have upped their predictions for the amount of snow expected in northwest @entity61 to 8 to 10 inches , with 15 inches in spots			1
this may be a shock to some , given that temperatures in places reached the mid- 60s on sunday			2
" may see 4 - 6 foot drifts ! " wrote @entity68 meteorologist @entity67 on @entity69			2
" @entity71 is beyond discouraged ! " such forecasts raised alarms throughout the @entity2 , leading to crowded stores as residents prepared for the storm			1
@entity77 , an entrepreneur and blogger in @entity79 , @entity80 , was one of them			0
writing on @entity69 , she said she made out well in her preparations			0
" the snow has everyone stocking up on groceries , " she said			2
" fresh produce is basically gone but i got the last gallon of chocolate milk			0
i call it a win			0
" record - setting february @entity91 set a february 21 record of 9 inches of snow , 4 more inches than the amount that fell the same date in 2010			1
monday might bring 6 to 10 more inches , forecasters said			1
@entity99 is approaching its february snowfall record of 20.7 inches , set in 1960			2
the state of @entity32 is also still digging out in many places			0
@entity103 saw its second - highest storm snowfall total on record last week with 14.2 inches over two days , the @entity68 said			2
the town of @entity107 in the state 's middle lay under a 22 - inch layer of white by the time the storm roared by			0
silver lining the snowstorm turned out to be a welcome one to many @entity115 and many others throughout the @entity2 , who have been suffering a drought for a third straight year			1
@entity32 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity80 and a host of other farm - heavy states have seen crop losses as a result			1
the @entity126 expects those conditions to continue into april , but near - record levels of snowfall will ease the problem and could help the drought end faster			0
" it snows so infrequently here			0
now we 've been in a really bad drought for several years ; really , really hot summers and just no moisture			0
so we 're thrilled to see snow or ice -- whatever moisture we can get , " @entity103 resident @entity137 said			0
ranchers embraced the storm , even though bitter cold snow can be deadly during calving season			0
@entity144 , a @entity32 rancher from @entity145 and the immediate past president of the @entity147 , said the storm caused more work for him because he had to bring his calves inside to warm them up			0
but he called the snowstorm a blessing for bringing good moisture to the winter wheat			0
rain , flooding the issue in @entity156 while millions will see snow -- including @entity158 , where 3 to 5 inches of snow and sleet are expected tuesday -- rain may rule for the next few days in parts of the @entity156			1
@entity163 , @entity164 , on the @entity165 , had overcast skies and a temperature of 68 degrees at 5 p.m. ct sunday			0
but within a few hours and through monday night , residents there can expect heavy rains and wind gusts as strong as 30 mph			1
the rain is part of a band affecting five @entity177 states where flash flood watches are in effect from monday afternoon through tuesday morning			1
some areas from @entity181 to @entity182 could see up to 4 inches of rain			2
@entity0 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
