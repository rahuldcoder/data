-- going to a restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing experience			2
but for @entity4 , there was one thing that was guaranteed to stress her out : seeing " @entity6 " misspelled on the menu			2
" it would just drive me ballistic , " @entity4 said			2
after years of practice , she 's learning to relax			2
" now , i just shrug it off			2
i still notice it , but it does n't drive me crazy like it used to			2
" many of us have a tendency to notice bad grammar and misspellings , as evidenced in the gallery above			1
but for copy editors , the people who read and edit stories for grammar , style and substance , fixing errors is their job			1
in honor of @entity28 , we sat down with @entity4 , one of the funniest grammar gatekeepers on the copy desk			1
she has been a copy editor for 15 years , six of which she 's spent at @entity0 in @entity32			1
the interview has been edited for clarity and brevity			2
@entity0 : what made you want to become a copy editor ? @entity4 : i wanted to be a writer first , actually , but i took a reporting class in college and hated it			1
i did n't like going up to people , saying , " your house just burned down			2
how did it feel ? " at the same time , i was taking an editing class			2
it came easily , i enjoyed it , and it seemed like fun			0
@entity0 : what are the most common errors you come across in your job ? @entity4 : where to start ? it 's probably punctuation errors , specifically comma errors with independent and dependent clauses			1
spell check means most people usually do n't make spelling errors unless they just do n't pay any attention at all			1
most people get verb tenses correct			0
and capitalization ... people love to capitalize things they should n't			0
@entity0 : what are your biggest grammar pet peeves ? @entity4 : misuse of the em dash when you should have a colon instead drives me crazy ! and i really hate the word " probe , " just in general			1
i have a bunch , but those are my two main ones			0
i 'm constantly taking em dashes out of stories			0
learn the colon ! there are proper ways to use a colon			0
i shake my fist at you			0
@entity0 : could you ever be close friends with someone who makes lots of grammatical mistakes ? @entity4 : i used to date somebody who did , back in college			0
he was as bad a writer as you could get			0
i used to type his papers for him and edit as i was going			0
you learn to live past it , i guess			0
@entity0 : have you ever made a mistake ? what 's your most memorable one ? @entity4 : oh , @entity101 , i 've made so many			1
that 's the nature of the business			0
when i was in @entity105 ( on the copy desk of the local newspaper ) , there was a month where i just made one after another			1
it 's your job not to do those things			1
i 've put incorrect information into stories			1
it kills you every time you do it , too			0
luckily , none of them has been libelous or gotten me called up to the publisher			0
@entity0 : what 's the best grammar fail you 've seen ? extra points if it made you laugh			1
@entity4 : where they misspell the team name on a jersey			0
those always crack me up			0
it 's not a grammar fail ; it 's more of a spelling fail			1
@entity0 : the grammar rule that must never be broken is _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @entity4 : you can make an argument that , within reason , you can break almost any grammar rule			1
you learn over the years that it 's ok to break the rules			0
it 's all in how you were taught			0
you go by what this story says to you			0
if this story splits an infinitive but it works , then i would split the infinitive ! how the story sounds is sometimes more important than being totally adherent to every grammar rule			1
@entity0 : how will you be celebrating @entity28 ? @entity4 : every day is grammar day when you 're a copy editor			1
is grammar really important to you ? what 's your biggest grammar pet peeve ? all grammarians are welcome to discuss this in the comments below .			1

@entity28 is celebrated on march 4
for copy editors , *spotting* errors and correcting them is their job
what are the best grammar and spelling fails you 've seen ?
