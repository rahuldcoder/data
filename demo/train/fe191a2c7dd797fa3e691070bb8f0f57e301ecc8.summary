-- few things are ever certain in the murky world of post-soviet politics , but the balance of evidence as it stands points overwhelmingly towards @entity8 separatists as the perpetrators of thursday 's missile attack that caused the death of 298 people on board @entity13 17			1
if this becomes the settled conclusion of the governments around the world once all the facts are known , the consequences for @entity16 are likely to be severe			1
throughout his time as @entity24 leader , @entity16 has been adept at exploiting divisions within the international community ; playing governments off against each other and sensing when the reluctance of certain countries to act would provide him with greater freedom of maneuver			1
so far he has just about managed to get away with annexing @entity34 and destabilizing eastern @entity35			0
@entity37 , unwilling to disrupt economic ties , has played a crucial role in limiting the scope of @entity41 sanctions and @entity16 has been able to draw on reserves of good will in the developing world to overcome the threat of full international isolation			1
@entity47 puts all of that in jeopardy			1
the thing that will worry @entity16 most is that so many of the victims were from the @entity52 , including more than half from the @entity54 alone			1
the @entity54 are relentless at using @entity52 channels to challenge those deemed to have harmed their interests -- just ask the @entity59			0
the start of @entity59 's @entity52 accession negotiations was single - handedly blocked by the @entity54 until @entity62 finally handed over general @entity63 to the @entity65 war crimes tribunal in 2011			0
@entity63 was held responsible for humiliating @entity54 peacekeepers during the @entity68 massacre sixteen years earlier			0
jet downing a ' game - changer ' in world relations with @entity24 with 193 of its own citizens among the dead , we can expect the @entity54 to demand @entity76 solidarity in the form of a much tougher response to the crisis			1
this will make it increasingly difficult for @entity37 to hold the line against the extension of sanctions			0
the overwhelming view among @entity52 leaders will be that the fighting in eastern @entity35 must now be brought to a definitive end and that @entity24 bears primary responsibility for the fact that it has continued so long			1
this narrows dramatically the gap between @entity76 and @entity94 perspectives on the situation and creates the potential for a much more united @entity41 policy towards @entity24			1
a second troubling factor for @entity16 is that the @entity35 crisis has now touched the developing world in a serious way for the first time			2
until yesterday it had been seen as a struggle between @entity24 and the @entity41 , with latent suspicion of the @entity41 among many emerging nations creating sympathy for @entity24 actions , if not actual approval			2
a major objective of @entity16 's @entity112 diplomacy has been to capitalize on that sympathy in order to increase his options and reduce @entity24 's reliance on the @entity41			1
he hastily concluded a gas deal with @entity117 and made a big play of his involvement in the recent @entity121 summit			0
the death of so many @entity123 and @entity124 on @entity125 leaves him with a lot of explaining to do			0
sensing that he was losing the military initiative to a newly emboldened @entity35 government , @entity16 had spent much of the last week preparing the way for a major escalation of @entity24 involvement in eastern @entity35			1
@entity24 forces had become much more directly involved in the fighting and allegations that @entity35 forces had fired missiles across the @entity24 border were intended to create a pretext for intervention			2
because of this disaster he now finds himself on the back foot once again			0
instead of being able to claim that he has been dragged reluctantly into the fighting , he now looks like the aggressor			0
@entity94 's ambassador to the @entity145 , @entity144 , could not have been clearer in apportioning blame in her speech at the @entity148 friday : " @entity24 can end this war			1
@entity24 must end this war			2
" the result is likely to be a @entity41 ultimatum to @entity24 to comply with its previous commitments to rein in the separatists and deliver them to the negotiating table			1
if @entity16 refuses , the consequences could be twofold			1
the first is that the @entity35 government would be given a much freer hand to continue and complete its " anti-terror " operations against @entity8 forces			2
the second would be a further tightening of @entity41 sanctions			0
if these included a shift to the long threatened " sector sanctions " covering whole industries , the impact could be severe at a time when the @entity24 economy is already looking extremely vulnerable			2
having maintained the tactical initiative for most of the last four months , @entity16 suddenly faces an uncomfortable dilemma			1
failure to co-operate in de-escalating the crisis invites the risk of deeper international isolation and real economic pain			0
but abandoning the separatists mean a loss of political leverage over @entity35 and an even bigger loss of face at home			0
on a purely domestic level , @entity16 has done well out of the crisis so far			2
popularity ratings that were collapsing two years ago are once more at near record levels			0
but he has achieved this by unleashing nationalist passions he does n't entirely control			0
whatever course he chooses , it is unlikely that his leadership will emerge unscathed			0

evidence points to @entity8 separatists as perpetrators of the attack that downed @entity47
if this becomes a settled conclusion , consequences for @entity24 's @entity16 are *significant*
@entity16 has been adept at exploiting divisions within the international community
the @entity47 crash leaves him with an uncomfortable dilemma , likely to damage his leadership
