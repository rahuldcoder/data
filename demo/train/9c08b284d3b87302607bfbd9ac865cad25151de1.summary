-- small cars on the @entity3 market are gaining traction with consumers , but some new models have more work to do to catch the @entity8 , designated by a respected safety group as an industry leader			1
the 2013 two - and four - door @entity11 turned in a " good " performance -- the highest score -- in a new type of tough front crash test earlier this year to earn the highest accolade from the @entity17			1
four other cars , including the @entity19 from @entity20 and the @entity21 , more recently posted acceptable ratings in the same @entity17 test			1
but that was good enough for them to earn top overall status as well from the organization , even though the @entity8 did better			2
but three models , including the @entity29 produced by @entity30 , and the @entity31 , posted marginal results and fell short of the loftiest rating for comprehensive safety , which also factors in results from other @entity17 front , side , rollover and rear crash tests			1
the @entity41 and two other vehicles made by @entity43 fared poorly in the test			2
a premium on fuel efficiency with half of the 12 tested models qualifying for @entity17 best performance -- called @entity53 -- consumers have more vetted choices when weighing safety , the group said			1
automakers trying to meet government and consumer demands for better fuel efficiency have in recent years jump - started production of small cars			1
buyers have responded positively , especially to @entity3 manufacturers , which for years relied on sales of gas - guzzling suvs and pickups			0
car companies designed models to perform better in the latest frontal and other tough crash tests , but some still need to address concerns			0
" manufacturers need to focus on the whole package , " said @entity72 , the @entity17 's chief research officer			0
" that means a strong occupant compartment that resists the kinds of intrusion we see in a frontal crash like this , safety belts that prevent a driver from pitching too far forward and side curtain airbags to cushion a head at risk of hitting the dashboard or window frame			0
" the latest institute test measured vehicle strength and occupant protection when only a quarter of a car 's front end hits a tree , a pole , or another vehicle at 40 mph			0
the collision occurs outside the structural areas of the vehicle designed to manage crash energy			0
this increases the risk of severe damage to the car and possible injury to the driver and passengers , the insurance group said			1
the test is also important for testing seat belts and air bags and measuring how well vehicle designs prevent injuries to feet and lower legs , according to the @entity17			0
@entity117 aces its first crash test automakers respond to test results the redesigned two - and four - door @entity8 posted " good " or top marks in the so - called overlap front crash test			1
that equaled the performance of some larger cars , which makes the result more impressive for @entity8			2
@entity127 , @entity21 , @entity128 -- all new this year -- and the @entity129 all posted acceptable ratings			0
the 2013 @entity29 , @entity31 and @entity131 scored marginally , while the @entity41 , the @entity132 and @entity133 turned in poor marks			1
" the small cars with marginal or poor ratings had some of the same structural and restraint system issues as other models we 've tested , " @entity72 said			1
" in the worst cases , safety cages collapsed , driver airbags moved sideways with unstable steering columns and the ( test ) dummy 's head hit the instrument panel			0
@entity149 curtain airbags did n't deploy or did n't provide enough forward coverage to make a difference			0
all of this adds up to marginal or poor protection in a small overlap crash			2
" automakers take special note of the @entity17 trials because the group is backed by the insurance industry			2
the federal government conducts separate crash tests and posts its own safety ratings			1
it does not perform the overlap test , however			0
@entity17 said the models with marginal or poor scores in the latest test are regular recipients of the group 's second - highest rating for overall safety -- @entity53			1
@entity43 said in a statement that it would " carefully evaluate " the @entity17 testing but notes that all of its cars sold in the @entity3 meet or exceed federal safety standards			2
" maximizing occupant protection is complex and involves a diverse range of variables , and @entity43 is proud of its strong safety record and the integrity of its products , " the statement said , noting that the @entity17 test " goes well beyond " government requirements			2
@entity41 also said that it would review the results of latest testing " as we seek opportunities for improvement			0
" @entity31 said in a statement that it is " passionately committed to building the safest vehicles available to the public and has already begun to incorporate this latest knowledge into the design and engineering of our cars going forward			1
" @entity30 also noted variables unique to each vehicle that are required to perform well in safety tests			0
" we are aggressively working to incorporate these into our models -- including our small cars like the @entity206 and @entity29 -- where technically feasible , " @entity30 said in a statement			1
@entity17 plans to run the overlap test on minicars next			0
@entity0 's @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 posts highest score in new front - crash test by insurance group
@entity21 , @entity19 marginal in test , but match @entity8 for overall safety
@entity29 , @entity31 *lag* , but still considered safe vehicles
