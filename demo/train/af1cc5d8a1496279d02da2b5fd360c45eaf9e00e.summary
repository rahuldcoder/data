@entity0 -- @entity2 marked the beginning of a two - day referendum as @entity5 went to the polls tuesday for the second time in 13 months to reshape their country 's future			1
in all , 11 people died tuesday in events relating to the referendum , @entity10 , head of the emergency unit at the ministry of health , told @entity1			1
two died of natural causes , while nine deaths " are suspected to be criminal , " he said			1
clashes were reported in several provinces			2
at least four were killed in @entity20 and one in @entity22 in clashes between supporters of the @entity25 and security			2
violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for " yes " votes inside or near polling stations and preventing @entity33 voters from reaching polling stations in parts of @entity36 , which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of @entity41 groups			1
but @entity42 , the executive director of the @entity43 , told state - run @entity44 , " so far , there have n't been any reports of fraudulent activities and the referendum is being conducted in a very calm and fair atmosphere			2
" on monday , @entity42 told @entity51 that the nearly 53 million eligible voters were divided among more than 30,000 committees and would be supervised by more than 13,000 judges			2
the violence began even before polls opened at 9 a.m. , when a bomb exploded near a @entity0 courthouse			0
no one was hurt , security officials said			0
despite the explosion , @entity5 waited in long lines to cast their ballots			1
" this will not scare us , " said @entity64 , a teacher who lives near the court			0
" in half an hour , i will go to my poll station and cast my ballot			0
" opinion : @entity36 mess ? blame @entity72 marred by violence tuesday 's deaths were but the latest twist in three years of political upheaval marked by two presidential departures and hundreds of deaths			1
tuesday 's referendum -- the first national vote since the ouster of the democratically elected president @entity82 -- is about changing the constitution to ban religious parties and give more power to the military			1
if the draft is passed , elections should follow			2
a deep political divide is evident between supporters of the interim military government and defenders of @entity82			1
protesters near the @entity0 court held aloft a poster of @entity5 army chief gen. @entity96 and chanted , " people want the execution of the @entity25 " and the " army and people are one hand			1
" in an incident outside a @entity0 school being used as a polling station , @entity1 witnessed three uniformed soldiers dragging a man into the school yard			0
the man was followed by about six people pointing fingers at him and accusing him of being a member of the @entity25			0
one of the soldiers slapped the man twice in the face , then struck him in his back			0
as the man cowered , several police officers arrived and dragged the man toward a corner , where they set upon him			0
as soon as @entity1 correspondent @entity120 began to record cell phone video of the incident , several of the civilians attempted to block his view , and one of the plainclothes officers ordered him to show his identification -- his permanent press credential and his referendum credential -- and took them both			0
as @entity120 continued to work , the soldier who had slapped the man asked to see the video -- which was nothing more than a jumble of blurred images -- then asked him to delete it			0
because " it was just shaky blur , " @entity120 said , he complied			0
after about an hour , the plainclothes policeman returned his credentials			0
one of the soldiers told @entity1 that they were trying to protect the man from being beaten by police			0
another journalist told @entity1 he had asked the man if that was true , and the man said it was not			0
at that point , the policeman intervened and shooed the journalist away			0
constitutional changes @entity5 voted on the last constitution in december 2012 , while @entity82 was still in power			1
but that constitution was suspended after the military deposed him in july			1
the latest proposal differs from the last constitution in several ways			2
some say the draft constitution would mean improved human rights and freedom of expression			1
the new version explicitly states that women are equal to men and allows them to hold official and judicial posts , @entity51 said			0
the new articles would also give parliament the right to impeach the president in the event of a breach of the provisions of the constitution , @entity51 said			2
other new articles would criminalize torture , discrimination and arbitrary forced displacement			0
critics say the latest draft would give too much power to the military without any civilian oversight			1
for example , the draft gives tremendous leeway to the army to try civilians in military courts -- something many @entity5 have opposed for years			1
military rule popular with @entity5 , study finds what 's behind @entity36 's turmoil @entity82 's opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values , but @entity82 's supporters say that the military has now returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler @entity199 , who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011			1
hundreds died in clashes between @entity5 security forces and @entity82 supporters in the weeks that followed his ouster			1
many in the @entity25 hold @entity96 , as the military chief , responsible for the bloodshed			2
in a statement issued amid the crisis , @entity96 said , " @entity36 has room for everybody , and we are keen to save every drop of @entity5 blood			1
" he added , " the @entity5 people are free to choose whoever to govern them , while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice			1
" @entity82 has been in detention since july and faces charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012			0
the protests were over the constitution that @entity82 shepherded into effect			2
@entity1 's @entity120 reported from @entity0 ; @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 reported from @entity237			2
@entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 also contributed to this report .			0
