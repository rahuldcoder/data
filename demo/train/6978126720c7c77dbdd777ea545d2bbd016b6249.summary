-- in a recent interview on @entity2 in @entity3 , rep. @entity4 , the state 's only congressman , offered this unhelpful tidbit : " my father had a ranch ; we used to have 50 - 60 wet --- - to pick tomatoes			1
it takes two people to pick the same tomatoes now			0
it 's all done by machine			2
" there it is -- the equivalent of what @entity21 used to call " the secret word			2
" it 's a word that is so offensive that i wo n't say or write it in the long form -- although many people do so freely , which is a problem			1
just as @entity29 have been conditioned to refer to the " n - word " as a sanitized alternative to the filthy and hurtful long - form version , so we too should start referring to the " w - word " when describing that ethnic slur used to describe @entity37 immigrants who came here , shall we say , without proper documents			1
i started this crusade in april 2007 with a column for @entity0			0
in it , i pointed out that the w - word is used with reckless abandon by right - wing cable talk show hosts but also left - wing journalists and celebrities			1
i could n't imagine these folks using the long form of the n - word even if they were merely repeating what someone else had said			1
yet they did not hesitate to use the w - word			1
this tells us at least two things			0
one , for many @entity29 , the w - word is n't as ugly or offensive as the n - word			1
and two , in the minds of the uninformed , @entity60 and @entity61 in the @entity62 do n't have the same legacy of racism , discrimination and mistreatment that affected african - americans			1
the experiences are n't identical , of course			2
but given that @entity60 in states such as @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 endured @entity76 - style segregation , job discrimination , inferior public schools , lynchings and hate crimes and repression by racist law enforcement organizations , there are similarities			2
liberals could n't wait to pounce on @entity4 's remarks , spreading the word ( literally ) and making sure the media knew that -- gasp ! -- a @entity89 congressman had referred to @entity37 immigrants using the w - word			1
for @entity93 , who are used to getting @entity96 votes without having to earn them and want to keep it that way by pointing out how bad @entity89 are , it was like @entity100 in springtime			0
it did n't help the @entity89 that @entity4 was clueless about what he done wrong			1
after the first round of criticism , the lawmaker tried to brush off the controversy by saying only that he had " used a term that was commonly used during my days growing up on a farm in @entity72 " and that he " meant no disrespect			0
i grew up around farms in @entity72			0
and , i can tell you , that term is all about disrespect			0
after fellow @entity89 blasted @entity4 for his comments and demanded that he apologize , the congressman swallowed his pride			1
in a statement , @entity4 wrote : " i apologize for the insensitive term i used during an interview in @entity124 , @entity3			1
there was no malice in my heart or intent to offend ; it was a poor choice of words			0
that word , and the negative attitudes that come with it , should be left in the 20th century , and i 'm sorry that this has shifted our focus away from comprehensive immigration reform			2
" if @entity4 's comments did shift the focus , it was n't for long			1
over the weekend , business groups and organized labor signaled a major breakthrough on the road to comprehensive immigration reform when they announced they had finally struck a deal on guest worker visas , a major obstacle			0
all that remains now is for the @entity149 's " @entity148 " to unveil their bipartisan legislation by their april 8 deadline			2
i 'm glad to see republicans jumped on @entity4 for his comments			1
but where is this outrage when other @entity89 lawmakers flirt with ethnic demagoguery ? and what about @entity93 ? they were in such a hurry to condemn @entity4 for using the w - word that they missed the fact that they were repeating the word over and over again , which suggests either that they 're tone deaf or that they were n't as offended as they pretended to be			1
what we learn is that while leadership on matters of race and ethnicity is hard to find in either party , political opportunism is alive and well			1
@entity29 are not good when it comes to condemning the loaded language of race and ethnicity			2
and we 're not sincere			0
it 's part of an overall breakdown in civility in our society and how dismissive we have become of anyone who raises concern			2
we 're too mean , too childish , too petty and too personal			0
just look at the shameful way that @entity191 commentator @entity190 recently lit into dr. @entity192 , a pediatric neurosurgeon and black conservative who has been critical of president @entity194			0
@entity190 all but called @entity192 an @entity195 , insisting that this accomplished individual who spoke his mind was @entity89 ' token " black friend " because he helps white people " assuage their guilt			0
" it 's never a good idea for one person of color to assess the authenticity of another -- especially if it 's just for ratings			2
@entity192 likewise stepped in it when he offered his opinion on gay marriage by drawing comparisons that were harsh and inappropriate			0
during a recent interview on @entity214 , he said this : " well , my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman			0
it 's a well - established , fundamental pillar of society and no group , be they gays , be they @entity225 , be they people who believe in bestiality			1
it does n't matter what they are			0
they do n't get to change the definition			0
" insisting that marriage be defined in a certain way is fine			0
equating same - sex marriage with behavior that society has declared deviant and criminal is not			0
it turns out that elected officials are n't the only ones who sometimes cross the line with their words and should apologize for it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity250 : rep. @entity4 used an ethnic slur to describe @entity37 immigrants
@entity250 : the " w - word " is just as offensive as the " n - word " and yet it 's still being used
he says political opportunism is alive and well as liberals pounced on @entity4
@entity250 : politicians are n't the only ones who cross the line in using loaded terms
