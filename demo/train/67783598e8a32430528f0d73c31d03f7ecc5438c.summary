@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was 2 a.m. on a stormy summer morning			1
as the thunder rumbled in the sky , we were led out of a sprawling terminal building through a narrow side door and down a staircase into the pouring rain			0
a waiting bus quickly filled up with soaked passengers dragging carry - on luggage			2
after a short ride across the dark tarmac followed by another storm - battered trek , we finally entered the freezing cabin of an @entity21 330 jetliner			2
smiling @entity23 flight attendants welcomed us on board , greeting us as if we were excited vacationers about to take off for our dream destination , instead of frustrated , tired and grumpy passengers			1
as we settled into our randomly assigned new seats , things turned eerily quiet			0
half of the plane -- the original passengers booked onto the airline 's 8 p.m. flight -- seemed to have long fallen asleep during their agonizing wait , while the other half -- those of us re-booked from a canceled 7 p.m. flight and moved onto this one -- were too exhausted to make a sound			1
the arrival of a second busload of drenched passengers was followed by a lengthy , silent wait on board -- with no updates from the cockpit			2
it was almost 3 a.m. when the pilot announced our impending departure thanks to improving weather			0
our plane finally roared into the starless skies at 3:08 a.m. -- more than eight hours after the scheduled departure time printed on my air ticket			1
hopeful start all signs pointed to a smooth journey when i checked in for flight @entity61 to @entity63 on a recent tuesday evening at the bustling @entity64 in @entity0 , a southern @entity1 metropolis long known as @entity0 in the @entity66 due to its former spelling -- which also explains the airport code @entity69			1
keenly aware of the country 's notorious flight delays , i kept checking a popular flight - tracking app geared toward air travelers in @entity1 installed on my phone			1
its information echoed that of the check - in agent : inbound aircraft had already arrived and weather conditions looked good at both origin and destination airports			2
more promisingly , the app 's algorithm put the probability of an on - time departure at 90 % -- " what a lucky break , " i thought , for a flight whose average delay had been 108 minutes in the past month			1
looking forward to a late night reunion with old friends over street snacks in @entity63 after an easy two - hour hop , i arrived at @entity95 shortly before the 6:20 p.m. boarding time			1
across the tarmac in the distance , a cluster of tower cranes dominated the horizon			0
an even bigger new terminal is under construction and slated to open in 2016 at @entity1 's second - busiest airport , which saw more than 50 million fliers pass through its existing terminal last year			1
massive growth decades of breakneck economic development have brought exponential commercial aviation growth , quickly propelling @entity1 to the no. 2 position in the global flight market , trailing only the @entity111			1
but all the shiny terminals and airplanes aside , @entity1 's reputation among frequent fliers continues to sink thanks to the country 's abysmal on - time performance , with the busiest hubs in @entity121 , @entity63 and -- to a lesser degree -- @entity0 often competing for the title of the world 's most delayed airport			1
meanwhile , nothing happened as our scheduled boarding time came and went			2
as our 7 p.m. departure time approached , some passengers started gathering around the counter to inquire about the flight status -- and only then did we hear the most dreaded of all @entity1 airport phrases : " air traffic restrictions			1
" it 's an all - purpose , vague term that can mean anything from bad weather to radar malfunctions , which may lead to less efficient aircraft movements ordered by @entity1 's already overly cautious controllers			1
lately , however , it 's apparently meant only one thing : military drills			2
military priority the @entity1 air force controls the vast majority of the country 's increasingly crowded airspace , leaving only narrow corridors for commercial airliners to take off , land and navigate -- and even those passages can be closed with little advance warning when the military conducts exercises			1
hundreds of flights to and from eastern @entity1 -- including @entity63 -- were canceled or severely delayed for days in late july during a wave of air drills			1
amid a huge public backlash , the military declared an early end to its exercises while blaming summer thunderstorms for most of the flight disruptions			2
back at my gate , an hour passed when ground staff mumbled something to a few passengers near the counter -- and just like that , boarding commenced			0
by 8:15 p.m. everyone had been seated on the aircraft			0
stretching my legs from the coveted exit row seat , i secretly congratulated myself for taking a slightly delayed flight that could still overcome its historically dismal performance			1
my hopes were dashed within minutes			0
soon after i promised a flight attendant i 'd help her evacuate the plane in the event of an emergency , the purser broke the bad news over the public address system : everyone has to deplane as the pilot failed to obtain a departure slot due to continuing air traffic restrictions			1
amid much grumbling and groaning , we returned to the gate area where the monitor still showed an " on time " departure			0
by now my flight - tracking app had warned me of delays for my flight as well as the next -- also last -- @entity1 @entity202 flight to @entity63 with no estimated new departure times			1
as the busy terminal slowly turned empty and shops began to close , our two gate agents -- speaking little @entity207 -- remained clueless about the flight status , much to the chagrin of @entity211 passengers on the flight , who appeared to be at a total loss			0
take two tensions were somewhat deflated when the agents started handing out food			0
a bottle of water , a pack of digestive crackers and a can of " eight - treasure porridge " bought the agents some peace and quiet as frustrated passengers ate and drank			0
boarding started abruptly at 10:20 p.m. and completed swiftly for the second time			0
i sensed a collective sigh of relief as the airplane started taxiing -- but it soon stopped and the wait resumed			0
as we sat on the tarmac , the cabin staff sounded less optimistic about the flight leaving the airport			0
then , lightning flashed and rain started falling			0
an hour after we boarded the plane for the second time , the pilot finally broke his total silence : " ladies and gentlemen , we are going back to the gate because of weather			0
" the cabin exploded with expletives , while my app alerted me about the cancellation of the flight			0
back in the deserted terminal , the only airline representative around explained that the last @entity1 @entity202 flight to @entity63 -- though badly delayed -- still had a chance of taking off and the carrier could accommodate all passengers wishing to continue their travel on that flight			1
" you 're such a liar ! " yelled a man in a black t - shirt , pointing his finger at the agent			0
" where 's your conscience ? look at all the kids and elderly stranded here ! " pounding the counter with his hand , another middle - aged man wearing glasses and a blue shirt demanded financial compensation			2
when the agent refused , the man barked : " you call your boss now ! call him in front of all of us now ! " in between his outbursts , the man also chastised fellow travelers for not answering his battle cry : " how do you expect to be compensated without banding together and making a scene ? each of us is entitled to at least 200 yuan ( $ 32 ) ! " irate passengers the mutiny of our flight was relatively subdued by @entity1 standards			1
in recent years state media has recorded numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers after flight delays or cancellations , ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees			0
surprisingly , in the name of preserving " social harmony , " @entity1 police often turn a blind eye to such egregious behavior that would certainly land the offenders in jail in many other countries			2
as the man with glasses carried on with his fight , he continued to express his disappointment at the onlookers : " you guys are too weak to defend your rights ! " most of us " weaklings " simply wanted to fly to @entity63 as soon as possible			0
when several agents eventually arrived after rebooking us on @entity316 , the final @entity63 - bound flight of the day and our last hope , we took the new boarding passes -- and walked past the " fighters " and into the rain			2
at the break of dawn , we landed at @entity63 's @entity325 airport and , as promised , checked luggage from our canceled flight promptly appeared on the conveyer belt			2
moving past the long line at the taxi stand outside the terminal without a single cab in sight , i walked straight to the subway station as the first train pulled in at 5:35 a.m. " maybe i can grab some delicious soupy dumplings for breakfast with a few friends before they head to work , " i thought as the train raced downtown .			0
