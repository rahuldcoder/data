-- it all started on my second date with @entity4			2
it was 1997 and on a whim we went into @entity8 to see the ball drop on @entity10 in @entity11			2
the closest we could get was @entity12 and @entity13			0
that 's pretty far away , but we could still see the glittering ball touching the sky			1
he was 19 , i was 17			0
for him , i was his childhood dream girl : i 'm tall , have curly brown hair and i play cello , so i was the real - life version of @entity23 's character in " ghostbusters " ( his favorite movie )			1
to me , he was smart , doting and hilarious			0
on what had to be the coldest night in the history of the ball drop , we shivered next to each other waiting patiently , with a few thousand spectators , to get one year closer to the millennium			0
at midnight , the ball dropped and the crowd erupted			0
we looked at each other in anticipation and we kissed			0
literally , behind us in @entity40 fireworks set the sky ablaze to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the five boroughs constituting @entity44			0
and when the heck did that saxophone player show up playing " @entity47 " ? we took this only - in - the - movies moment as a sign from the universe that we were meant to be together			1
there was one problem : @entity4 is half - black			1
i am white , half - @entity54 in fact			1
in the back of my mind , i knew @entity4 's race would pose a problem for my family			1
not to get explicit , but racial epithets were common in my house			0
my dad emigrated from @entity64 in the early 1970s and worked in construction			1
the culture on the job , coupled with his solid self - righteousness and @entity69 thinking , led to an intense hatred of anything " different			1
" the n - word , the c - word , the other c - word , the g - word , the s - word -- they all echoed in my house regularly			1
my mom , who moved to @entity44 from @entity78 , was indifferent on race but was n't about to challenge my dad 's way of thinking			1
how did i come out of this house without being a racist ? that i ca n't answer			0
race was n't an issue for me			0
i grew up in @entity87 and was exposed to all races when i was young			0
when i met @entity4 , it sounds corny , but i never saw a color -- i just saw @entity4			1
fast - forward to senior prom : i decided this would be the time for my parents to meet the guy i 'd been dating			1
i looked stunning in my red - sequined @entity98 ball gown , and @entity4 was dapper in a tux and top hat			1
we had already , by that point , said we loved each other and knew this was something special			0
i thought that introducing him to my parents in a public place where my dad could n't freak out was the way to go			1
the conversation in the parking lot at the prom literally went like this : " @entity114 , this is @entity4			1
" @entity116 to meet you , @entity4			0
" " @entity116 to meet you , sir			0
" " ok , have a good time			0
" then my dad walked away			1
@entity4 and i danced through the night and left the next day for the customary fun weekend to the @entity119 with my classmates			0
i returned home a day later			0
saying a nuclear bomb went off in my family would not begin to describe what happened			0
he had stewed while i was away , waiting to unleash his fury			0
i was led to the basement to receive the lecture of my life			1
no way was his daughter going to date a black man			1
" do you want to be a big mama ... barefoot and pregnant for the rest of your life ? do you want a bunch of black babies ? " he screamed			1
" you 're going to throw your life away on that n --- -- ? " full coverage : " @entity141 " : kids on race " those are just some of the lines i remember			1
it went on for hours , and he said a lot more , but i had shut my brain off after the first few minutes			0
in my mind , i was just dating @entity4			2
in my dad 's mind , my life was over			1
the fallout continued for months			0
my dad refused to talk to me or co-sign my school loan papers for college			2
i was kicked out of the house on more than one occasion			0
@entity4 felt helpless , livid at being judged by a handshake and his skin color , but he knew it did n't have anything to do with him			0
it was all in my dad 's head			1
from what i 'd heard about @entity4 's parents , it sounded like we were on track to repeat history			2
@entity4 's mom , a white woman from @entity173 , had a troubled relationship with her own father as a result of her dating @entity4 's dad , a black man from @entity179			1
i was grateful that she let me hide out in her apartment and served as my refuge , and she stayed out of the drama			0
we had to figure this out on our own			0
all the fighting never changed my feelings for @entity4 , and i never considered breaking up with him to appease my family			0
i knew @entity4 was " the one , " and i was n't about to let my racist father get in the way of my happiness			0
for the next eight years , i dated @entity4 in secret			2
my dad did n't know a thing			2
it did n't matter since we barely talked			0
my mom had an inkling , but i did n't tell her much			0
@entity4 and i had milestones , we went to friends ' weddings , became honorary aunts and uncles			0
we even moved in together , and for years my parents were none the wiser			2
by 2006 , i was well into my job at @entity0			0
my colleagues knew what was going on and encouraged me to talk to my dad again , this time as a strong adult woman who was succeeding in a career and no longer financially dependent on my parents			2
it was eating me up inside that i had to pretend that a huge part of my life did n't exist			2
i took my parents to lunch , hoping again that there would be safety in a public space			0
sometime before the @entity216 © e , i explained that i was still dating the same man who was rejected so ferociously nearly 10 years earlier			1
i told my dad i understood he was trying to protect his daughter , but he should have trusted me to make the right decision for myself			2
i said i could n't pretend i was n't with @entity4 , we wanted to get married , and to be a part of my life , they had to accept it			2
" do you love him ? and does he love you ? " my dad asked cautiously			1
he 's my soul mate , " i answered			2
after eight years of tears and anxiety , my dad conceded			1
i sometimes wonder why my dad had a change of heart , because all discussion on the matter ended that day			1
i do n't think he had one " aha " moment , but maybe it just took years of rolling it over in his head and realizing that his preconceived notions of what would happen to me if i dated @entity4 were wrong			2
i was neither a " big mama " ( what does that even mean ? ) or barefoot , pregnant or destitute			0
i was solidly in my adult life and happy in love			1
@entity4 and i were married on august 4 , 2007			0
my dad walked me down the aisle it 's been 14 years since the roller coaster started			1
it almost seems like the lying , the hurt and the drama happened to someone else			0
@entity4 is my family , my other half , the love of my life			1
he 's just as much a member of the family as anyone else			2
@entity4 visits my parents often , and my dad sometimes calls him just to chat			2
sometimes my dad will jokingly refer to him as " chocolate milk " or " @entity256 , " maybe as way of relieving some tension around the intense hatred he had once possessed			2
we even took a family trip to my dad 's childhood home in @entity64			1
i think my dad was secretly thrilled to have @entity4 to share his stories of walking for miles as a 5 - year - old to see my grandmother in the hospital , or throwing a cat on a horse 's back just to watch both animals squeal			1
slowly , my dad shared the family myths and stories with my husband and we grew closer			1
as we get ready to start our own family , i think about how i will explain this all to my future child ( or children -- that 's still up for discussion ) about what we went through to be together			2
cheesy as it sounds , i think i 'll tell them that love really conquers all , and time , with a dash of patience , heals many wounds			2
i 'll teach them that change is always possible , even when you think it 's not			1
and i 'd emphasize that forgiveness for someone else 's misperception does n't have to come from an apology , but can be a way of allowing yourself to deal with a situation that is out of your control			1
and i 'll make sure not to censor anything , because they deserve to know how we found a way to break through hatred to find acceptance			0
