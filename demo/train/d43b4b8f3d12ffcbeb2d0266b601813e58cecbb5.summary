-- faced with the threat of arrest , fans of an @entity3 soccer club defied police sunday by chanting an anti-semitic term which they claim to have appropriated in a positive manner			1
a section of @entity11 supporters chanted " @entity25 " and " we 'll sing what we want " at the home @entity13 match against @entity17 rival @entity15 -- a fixture which last season saw one of the visiting fans banned for life for performing a @entity24 - style salute			1
just one man was arrested this time , the @entity28 @entity27 reported , as he was taken aside by police at halftime and held on suspicion of committing a public order offense in the @entity33 at @entity34			0
@entity11 fans greeted their players ' entrance onto the pitch with their customary " @entity40 " greeting , @entity41 reported , and sang " @entity43 , he 's a @entity44 " for the club 's former @entity15 striker			1
while last season some @entity15 fans chanted " @entity54 is coming for you " and mimicked the sound of gas chambers , this time they responded to the call of " @entity51 " with humor , replying with " racists ! racists " according to @entity41			2
@entity11 's fanbase has a large @entity59 contingent , and they originally called themselves " @entity25 " in response to anti-semitic abuse from rival supporters			1
however , the use of sensitive words has sparked intense debate -- police said before the match they would arrest any offenders , but @entity28 prime minister @entity69 defended the @entity11 fans ' chanting			1
" there 's a difference between @entity11 fans self - describing themselves as @entity51 and someone calling someone a @entity51 as an insult , " @entity69 told the @entity28 - based @entity73 newspaper			2
" you have to be motivated by hate			0
hate speech should be prosecuted -- but only when it 's motivated by hate			0
" but @entity69 's views have been dismissed as " ludicrous " by @entity83 , a group which prides itself on " promoting fairness , justice and equality within all sports			0
" @entity88 , a spokesperson for the group and a member of the @entity90 , says the attempt by @entity11 fans to suggest they have reclaimed the word " is an insult to anybody 's intelligence			2
" while @entity11 's fans may have seemingly won this battle with the police , on the pitch the club 's title hopes were hit by a 3 - 0 defeat -- @entity11 ' first home reverse this season			1
@entity107 international defender @entity106 scored the @entity15 ' first away goal of the 2013 - 14 campaign before @entity110 and @entity111 , with a solo breakaway , moved their club out of the bottom three			0
@entity11 dropped to sixth place , three points adrift of north @entity17 rival @entity117 -- which returned to the top on goal difference above @entity120 after being held 1 - 1 by @entity121			1
@entity122 headed a first - half opener , but @entity124 -- criticized in midweek by manager @entity126 after being seen smoking outside a nightclub -- rescued @entity117 with a deflected 63rd - minute equalizer			0
@entity129 , the fourth @entity17 club in action sunday , claimed third place with a 3 - 1 victory at @entity133 thanks to late goals from substitutes @entity135 and @entity137			2
@entity138 had put the @entity139 ahead in the fourth minute after combining with striker @entity140 , but @entity141 gave @entity133 hope with a second - half equalizer			0
@entity144 moved into the top four after a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity147 , with a goal in either half from winger @entity150 and substitute @entity151 .			0
