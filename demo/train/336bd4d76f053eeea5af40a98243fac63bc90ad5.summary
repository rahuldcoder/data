@entity0 -- thousands of young men shouting , driving in pick - up trucks and taking control of the streets of @entity6 was , only a few years ago , a reason to flee			1
they are scenes reminiscent of the 14 - year civil war that devastated @entity0 and left an estimated 250,000 people dead			2
but today , these young men and women are thronging the streets of the capital in excitement - supporting their preferred candidates in the last day of campaigning in the nation 's elections			2
the front - runner : the first @entity20 female president , grandmother of three and newly - awarded winner of the @entity22			1
but what president @entity23 really wants is to win re-election for a second term in office			0
" just to consolidate the gains , preserve the peace , to keep bringing the development - we 've put in the fundamentals , the foundation - the possibility to reach our accelerated growth and development , fix our infrastructure , the potential and chances are so high , " she said			0
but president @entity23 has already broken one major promise - that she would not run for a second term			1
and many @entity0 believe she has not fulfilled many of her first term campaign promises - with up to 80 % of @entity0 unemployed and a majority living without basic necessities such as water and electricity			0
and there has been plenty of campaigning going on for tuesday 's election , some of it a little unorthodox - i saw one car handing out money to crowds as it drove through town ! the main opposition party - the @entity60 - is drawing big crowds with their popular @entity63 candidate , @entity0 's most famous international football star - @entity62			1
" madame @entity23 - all the promises she made , she has never kept them - and the people are ready , you can see the excitement - that they 're ready for a change , " he said			1
forty percent of @entity0 are under the age of 14 and many believe that , at 72 , president @entity23 is out of touch with the needs of the average @entity0			1
" i promise them a good life , a life that is affordable			0
i want to see @entity0 not suffering and to have light and water and healthcare , " @entity62 added			2
desirable , but difficult promises to keep for any incoming administration in a country where many buildings in the capital are still riddled with bullet holes			0
the voters themselves are split : " the process she started - we need a person who will finish that peaceful process , " one said			0
while another said : " she promised and she did n't do it - she promised and she never delivered			0
