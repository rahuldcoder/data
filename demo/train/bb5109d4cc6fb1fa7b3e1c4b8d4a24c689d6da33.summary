the hubble space telescope peers hundreds , thousands , millions of light - years into the universe to study novas , quasars and nebulas			2
but weeks ago , it pulled its focus way in close -- to just light - minutes away -- to view a rare and beautiful spectacle at the planet @entity11			1
three big moons crossed past it at the same time , casting their shadows onto @entity11 's swirling surface			1
from the perspective of people theoretically standing on @entity11 , it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once , astronomers said			1
in the last 15 years , this has happened only twice , the @entity21 said			1
" the next one will be 2032 , " said astronomer @entity22			0
so , @entity23 shot photos rapid fire to capture the rare conjunction in late january			1
and @entity21 published them thursday , along with a short fast - motion video animation			0
there was no great scientific gain in @entity23 taking the snaps			1
the moons and their crossings have been examined plenty and are well - known			2
" we felt that there are images which have aesthetic value above and beyond their scientific value , " said astronomer @entity35			1
it was a gift of beauty to the public			1
@entity11 is a sort of mini-solar system inside our solar system			2
it 's the largest body after the sun. and like the sun , it comprises a lot of helium and hydrogen gas , but it does n't have enough mass to burst into the intense nuclear fusion that makes the sun a fireball , @entity46 says			2
it has many satellites , including 62 moons , and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing @entity63 constantly			2
but only four of them are highly visible standouts			0
they are @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
the four moons are called the @entity72 satellites , because @entity75 astronomer @entity73 discovered them in 1610 , when he pointed his telescope skyward , forever changing human perception of our place in the cosmos			0
many of today 's hobby telescopes are much stronger than his , so anyone can easily follow in his footsteps and cast the same gaze			0
and many did , when the three moons passed , posting their recordings of the triple moon transit on @entity90			0
the moons spin around @entity11 at different speeds ; their orbits vary in duration from two to 17 days , so having them line up together to zip across the side of @entity11 pointed our way is special			1
@entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity69 put on the show without @entity68 , which was too far off to the side to make it into the group photo			0
@entity67 is in the spotlight of space explorers , because they think there may be life in the fluid water underneath its surface of solid ice			0
if it is found there , this would be the first discovery of life in our solar system aside from that on @entity63 .			0

three of @entity11 's four great moons crossed its sunny side in january
that 's rare ; it has happened only twice in the last 15 years
@entity23 's images are *primarily* for aesthetic purposes , a gift to the public
