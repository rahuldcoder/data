-- for @entity3 hosts who want to keep tabs on their homes , a full home security system might be overkill			1
they 're expensive , and live cameras and motion detectors invade guests ' privacy			0
so how do they make sure guests keep the volume down , are n't smoking inside and do n't ransack their home ? a new device called @entity17 combines microphones with environmental sensors to detect anything out of the ordinary in your home while you are away			1
a broken window while you 're at work , the sound of your teenagers throwing a raging party , @entity29 sneaking an unauthorized after - dinner cigar			0
" they want to have peace of mind and know that everything is fine , but they do n't want or need full security systems , " said @entity31 , co-founder of @entity32 , the start - up that makes @entity17			1
small , round and plastic , @entity17 looks like a traditional smoke alarm crossed with a speaker			1
sounds are matched with data from the other sensors to figure out what might have happened -- a loud crash followed by a drop in temperature might mean a window was broken			1
it hears when an existing smoke detector goes off and sends an alert , though it 's not certified as an official smoke detector on its own			2
it has a microphone that can detect sounds outside that the human ear could pick up			2
environmental sensors pick up temperature ; the particle sensor can tell what 's in the air			2
when @entity17 detects any notable changes , it sends an alert to the owner 's smartphone			1
the mobile app also shows a timeline of all events , so someone can quickly scroll through the day to see when people were in the home			0
all the computation takes place on the device ; there is no live - streaming audio , no way to eavesdrop on your home and no overwhelming amount of data to sort through			0
@entity31 worked in the @entity86 at @entity87 for seven years , where he helped build prototypes for early , experimental product ideas			1
he left the company last year to start form with co-founders @entity91 , @entity93 and @entity94 ¶ f. together , they wanted to create a new genre of smart - home device			0
the original idea started with @entity3 hosts , but it 's for anyone who wants a lightweight security option for their home or office			1
it 's meant for anyone who does n't need a complex security system , or who is n't comfortable with images from inside their home being stored on the cloud			1
@entity113 - connected cameras like @entity114 are a popular alternative to full security systems , but images and videos stored in the cloud can be vulnerable to hackers			0
for example , a @entity122 website is hosting hacked streams of strangers ' video cameras			0
@entity17 does n't store audio information , processing it all directly on the device			2
form has raised $ 150,000 on @entity129 and is working with a manufacturer in @entity131 on the first production run , though it has tested early prototype devices			0
early next year , the @entity136 - based company will ship the device to its first pilot customer , a management company that rents offices for short periods			0
form hopes to test it with a hotel soon after that , and make it available to consumers by next summer for around $ 100 each			0
tech companies including @entity87 and @entity148 , and traditional home stores like @entity150 's and @entity151 , are all pushing smart - home products as the next big thing			1
@entity31 saw that big companies were taking existing products like thermostats and refrigerators and adding @entity113			2
" we felt there was a need for something that was simple , " said @entity31			2
" and we do n't have to make products that are in the same mold			0

@entity17 is a new kind of home security *gadget* that listens *constantly* for unusual sounds
it can pick up a window breaking or loud talking and send an alert to a smartphone
co-founder @entity31 spent 7 years in @entity87 's @entity86
