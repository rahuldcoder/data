-- on a bright @entity4 afternoon in far - west @entity5 , i steer myself along a high - desert , two - lane highway , tufts of dried - up tumbleweed thistle packed like snow against barbed - wire fences			1
the sky above opens up its cobalt tent ; the space beneath stretches as far as an ocean			1
rugged landscapes and wide - open spaces inspire artists and visitors in @entity5			1
@entity18 90 leads me through the @entity19 and ocotillo - and - cactus flats to @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , a string of three @entity4 towns just 60 miles apart			1
here they live as siblings in a remote , starkly beautiful landscape as mysterious to me as @entity29			2
" driving from @entity31 , we often joke , ' who would put a town out here ? and who would live in it ? ' " says @entity21 wood artist @entity34			1
" and we realize , well , us			2
" far - off inspiration it 's hard to believe inspiration can come in so far - off and austere a place , but it 's all around you			2
@entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 sit along @entity18 90 like hitching posts			1
on first glance , the three are all @entity46 of another era			2
@entity21 's one blinking red light ; the @entity49 and @entity50 ; @entity23 's three blocks of storefronts facing the railroad			1
but i visit in search of the defining quality that draws people 400 miles west of @entity58 to live and to visit			1
i 'm looking for the real towns , what makes them so alluring and freeing , to " slow down and see , " as @entity34 describes			1
as one @entity64 transplant to @entity21 tells me , " good things come with space			1
" vintage and vogue @entity34 introduces himself on my first night in @entity21 at the opening of a gas - station - turned - folk - art - gallery called @entity69			1
the two rooms of @entity69 glow in the pitch - black stillness of the nearly 2,000 - person town			2
inside , the scene teems with locals , some who look like @entity74 , some like @entity76 hipsters , all toasting yet another gallery émigré			2
@entity34 , who moved to the @entity4 eight years ago , wears a canvas @entity81 jacket and black designer eyeglasses , a stylish mix of rancher and @entity86 seen all over @entity21			1
" out here you can just breathe , " he says , referring to the whole @entity4 , where @entity5 leans toward the @entity88 and @entity89 reaches back			1
" that constant push to do is gone			2
and instantly at night , there are a million stars			0
in the openness you suddenly feel creative			0
" @entity97 : @entity98 true cowboys ride bikes in @entity21 , vintage bicycles replace horses			1
@entity34 himself owns more than 10 throwback schwinns and @entity105			0
after a night 's sleep at the @entity109 , a motor court revamped with minimalist looks ( and record players ) , i rise early and pedal through town on a hotel bike			2
i pass the high school , the silver water tower , and the pinkish 1886 @entity118 courthouse -- all signs of @entity4 normalcy			0
large cherry red letters mark one gorgeous white building -- @entity123 -- near @entity124 's , a sleek @entity126 cafe , and down from the hacienda - like @entity127			0
i stop near the single flashing signal by @entity130 and @entity131 , where @entity133 programs mix with station manager @entity135 's local news and interviews			0
@entity137 late morning , the @entity137 , an aluminum - body gourmet lunch truck , rolls into town and parks near the tracks , where honey - colored benches and tables sit under the farmers market pavilion			1
@entity145 the dog roams around while folks buy @entity149 dishes from the @entity137 , manned by a friendly couple , @entity151 and @entity152			0
savoring open space from my chickpea @entity157 basket , it 's off to the @entity158 , a former army base filled with art installations by @entity123 and his contemporaries			2
@entity123 , whose work has had tremendous influence on modern sculpture , began buying land south of @entity21 and buildings in town in the 1970s for preservation purposes as well as his own use			1
he savored @entity21 's open space			1
high desert inspiration of the highway town trio , @entity22 is the busy one , where outliers visit for dry cleaning , a pharmacy , an @entity177 pickup station or the largest grocery			1
@entity22 's thriving liberal arts university @entity179 looks down on the town , which , like its neighbor communities , lives at nearly mile - high elevation			1
sweet aromas in the mountain - fresh air pull locals to @entity187 's @entity186 , where folks pass the paper over homemade cinnamon rolls			0
even as a passerby , i get warm looks that say pull up a chair			0
@entity97 : @entity195 @entity197 ' it rattle a block down @entity200 at @entity201 , the spirited @entity198 greets me at the door , as colorfully dressed as the walls in her place			0
" you do n't come to @entity22 for a mall fix , " @entity205 , a nine - year employee , says			1
" but we can make it rattle if we need to			0
" in a town of painted murals -- i see several driving from @entity201 to the @entity50 -- alpineers draw from the same creative wellspring as do its sister towns			1
listen to the music as the sun curves to its peak , @entity22 steals a few hours from winter , and guitar - maker @entity219 wipes a bead of sweat off his brow			1
living on 10 acres just south of town , his workshop window faces uninterrupted miles of native grasses and wispy clouds			2
his completed instruments , shiny and perfect , hang inside			0
you 'd swear laser - guided machines made the guitars			0
jackrabbits can talk back in town , comic strip artist @entity235 opens his small studio with pleasure			2
" @entity145 , " his cartoon ode to the ecology of the vast @entity4 wilderness , stars kangaroo rats , jackrabbits and coyotes			0
" it 's such an emphatic region , " the quiet man says			0
" as an artist , you really respond to it			0
" guided by biologists from @entity258 and @entity259 , interpreters from @entity254 and his own wandering eye , @entity252 's more than 40 " @entity145 " online episodes bring art and the landscape side - by - side			0
long way home in the couple of days i 've spent traveling around these three towns , i 've found the rolling drive between places to be quite calming			2
@entity205 at @entity201 said i would			0
" this is a healing place , " she says , " because people have time			0
" from @entity22 , i tune into @entity272 : 93.5 , the region 's community station , letting the midday classical hour play sound track to the passing miles of sage brush , desert willow and limestone rises			1
welcome to @entity23 thirty miles flash by as a cello player finishes a piece that sounds like strings singing through the radio			1
@entity23 ( population 455 ) is by far the smallest of the three			1
for days , people in @entity21 and @entity22 have mentioned two mainstays in @entity23 over and over : the @entity289 and photographer @entity290			1
@entity97 : @entity291 worth a thousand words " the landscape is like a relative now , " @entity290 tells me , lounging on a leather chair in his highway photo gallery			2
window - size , silver gelatin prints of his " 800,000 - acre backyard , " as he calls @entity4 , hang in the serene , wood - planked room			0
@entity290 lights up when i ask about the vistas surrounding us , where the onetime @entity289 cook has spent 20 years documenting the region			0
" when i first go back , i usually start on old @entity308 , " he says about his journeys from @entity23 into the rough country			1
he describes a flashing creek photographed by moonlight on a 30 - minute exposure , much the way @entity313 shot @entity314 ; floating through the @entity315 ; and how he hikes to spots by dusk so he can wake up there			0
" i could shoot this area forever			0
" whispering memories this brief moment with @entity290 is telling			0
the photographer 's eyes drift off			0
and he 's gone away somewhere miles from this room			0
his 60,000 photos of the @entity4 must carry countless memories , unspoken things that act as muse and healer both			2
i find myself remembering this as night falls over @entity23			1
a fire crackles in my @entity333 , while the fountain in the courtyard slowly begins succumbing to a sinking chill			0
outside , i stand in the cold , looking up over the adobe walls at a sky full of stars , believing these places have whispered to me as well			0
