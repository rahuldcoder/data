-- viking raiders once landed on @entity3 soil to change the face of the nation -- and 1200 years later a group of muscly @entity7 gained further ground in the @entity10 's sporting invasion of the @entity11			1
the victorious @entity7 landed another blow for @entity13 sunday as the team staged an exciting 34 - 27 victory over the @entity16 in @entity17			1
the team 's 28 - year - old star running back @entity20 and @entity21 scored two touchdowns apiece			0
it was an important first win of the season for the @entity7 but the entertaining game could have even greater significance for the @entity10 's hopes of establishing a @entity29 franchise			1
a regular season game was first played in @entity17 in 2007 but , for the first time this season , two games were scheduled on the opposite side of the @entity34			1
next month the @entity35 face the @entity36			0
both @entity10 games at @entity38 sold out within hours			1
organizers of the @entity10 's @entity17 foray stirred the fever further saturday as they held a block party for an estimated half a million fans on the streets of central @entity17 tailgate yearning " it is a sign that the game is growing globally , " @entity10 commissioner @entity47 told @entity48 earlier this year			1
" i think the message is clear			0
there are passionate fans who love the @entity10 in the @entity3			1
" there were also plenty of domestic fans who were happy to travel to @entity17 to support their teams			1
" i love it , " @entity60 from @entity16 , who now lives in @entity61 , told @entity0			2
" it 's a really good idea			0
" it gets the @entity16 brand out there internationally as a big team			2
" @entity67 from @entity68 added : " i love the pub atmosphere in @entity17			2
although @entity71 culture is the tailgate , which i 'm not seeing here ! " perhaps not every facet of the @entity13 experience can so easily translate to @entity3 shores where soccer , rugby and cricket hold sway as the most popular spectator sports			0
but that is not deterring the @entity10 from pressing on with its mission to gain new ground in @entity84			2
american football is just that , an @entity71 sport , but if the sport can successfully " go global " that presents the @entity10 with new markets and new business opportunities			2
profit not a priority " this is an investment and we are trying to grow something , " @entity91 , managing director of @entity10 @entity3 , told @entity0			2
" we are not concerned about profit yet			0
" but for the last two years our games have broken merchandise records for @entity38 for all events -- and that includes pop concerts			1
" developing the @entity10 in @entity17 , or any @entity29 franchise for that matter , does not come without its problems			1
" there are multiple challenges , " @entity105 's @entity10 writer @entity104 , who was at the game in @entity17 , explained to @entity0			1
" travel would scare off a lot of potential free agents , it could be hard for a team to be competitive just because of that			0
" the tax [ in the @entity3 ] is another issue , 45 % is the top tax bracket			0
that is something that , again , could scare off players from coming over			0
" it also comes down to the fan base being large enough			0
you can fill @entity38 with 80,000 people once , twice this year , but can you do that for 10 games a year ? i think that 's the one of the many unknowns			1
" if you put a team in @entity17 , i do n't think it would be difficult to make a profit			2
" but what do you do when [ they ] have to play 10 games in the @entity136 ? how do you get them to travel ? do any of the visiting fans travel at all ? that 's an entirely different sort of issue			2
" troublesome travels @entity142 , who made the journey from @entity17 to @entity68 , was also skeptical about the reality that @entity10 could become a regular fixture in @entity17			1
" the time zones and travel present a serious issue , " he told @entity0			0
" to have a global sport that 's weekly is troublesome			0
if you break it up into something that is less frequent than weekly and that allows for serious travel then it makes sense			0
" [ a @entity17 franchise ] is a great idea , the @entity10 would make a ton of money out of it			1
i just have n't figured out how it could work ! " the man in charge of the game , @entity161 , is also juggling the numbers to work out how to develop the game away from @entity71 shores			0
" what is the next step ? do we move to three games , are there other ways to grow the game in the @entity3 ? " he said			0
" this is a market where we need to be more active and to grow our game			0
" for now , @entity20 -- who had never been outside the @entity136 before his trip to @entity17 -- and his fellow @entity7 raiders can feel satisfied with winning the game , as well as perhaps inching the @entity10 a little closer to a permanent place on sport 's @entity29 map .			1

the @entity10 returned to @entity17 for first of two games at @entity38 this season
@entity7 *defeated* @entity16 34 - 27 in *thrilling* game
@entity10 organizers want to *continue* to invest in @entity29 games
but fans and experts alike warn there are many *logistical* problems still to be *resolved*
