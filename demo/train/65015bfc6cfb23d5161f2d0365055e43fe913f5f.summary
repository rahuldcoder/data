-- attention white @entity1 : your days of running things are over			2
you have jumped the shark			0
but there 's no need to feel bad for @entity7			1
they 've had an amazing run			1
every single president in our nation 's history , except for @entity14 -- a @entity15 -- and @entity16 , has been a white @entity17			1
except for a handful of exceptions , for over 200 years the presidential nominees of both major political parties have been @entity7			1
@entity22 had almost as many victories in a row as the @entity25			0
look at this year 's presidential tickets : a @entity28 , an @entity29 , and two @entity30			0
even some of the keynote speakers at the @entity34 and @entity35 conventions were not @entity7			1
the @entity35 featured @entity39 - @entity38 catholic @entity36 and the @entity34 tapped @entity41 - @entity40 , @entity42			1
times are so bleak for @entity7 that there 's not a single one on the @entity45			1
likewise , in @entity47 , the percentage of @entity17 fell from 74 percent in 1961 to a slim majority of 55 percent today			1
neither the current @entity49 ( @entity50 : @entity15 ) nor the @entity52 majority leader ( @entity51 : @entity28 ) is wasp			0
i 'm sincerely not gloating			0
and my jibes are in jest			0
but what i 'm happy about is that our two major political parties are increasingly reflecting the new face of @entity40			1
the demographics of our nation are changing and , by 2042 , minorities are expected to become the majority in the @entity40 objectively , the delegates at this year 's @entity34 convention were far more diverse			1
the @entity35 convention looked more like the early bird dinner crowd at the @entity68			0
opinion : in @entity71 , candidates are salesmen trying to close the deal however , in the @entity35 's defense , a party that is 90 % white , they have started to slowly showcase minorities , such as sen. @entity76 and @entity77			2
they are well aware that if they do n't , the @entity35 will go the way of the @entity82			0
there 's little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates			0
and we will likely see in the not too distant future a president who is @entity41 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 or @entity92			2
( that screaming sound you might have heard was @entity95 shrieking in horror at the idea of a @entity92 - @entity40 president			1
) this is a testament to our nation			0
we are by our very nature progressive			0
it may take years , or even decades , to see change , but we always march forward , not back			0
so , how did we get to where we are today where the white @entity17 establishment seems to be losing power ? well , it 's kind of complicated ( as these things tend to be )			1
there are tons of reasons			0
but one important factor that has contributed to today 's political landscape is changing voting rights laws			1
back in the days when our nation was founded , only white men who owned land could vote			2
that means rich white men with money get to control the political system			1
( i know some of you are thinking : how is that different than today ? ) in our first presidential election in 1789 , no women , no blacks , no poor white men , and in many states neither @entity30 nor @entity90 , were permitted to vote			2
over time , some states abandoned the requirement of land ownership so that poor white men could vote			2
and the religious restrictions were also lifted so that @entity137 were able to vote			0
opinion : democrats and @entity35 need a plan to keep @entity40 dream alive however , it was n't until after 1870 , when the 15th amendment was ratified , that black @entity40 citizens were finally guaranteed the right to vote			2
( although poll taxes , literacy laws and other measures were still employed in some states to disenfranchise black voters			2
) and it took all the way to 1920 -- more than 100 years after our first president was elected -- that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th amendment to our @entity159			2
enfranchising voters of all backgrounds has led to the opening up of our democratic process			0
minorities no longer just voted -- they became active in politics			0
and they did n't just show up at political meetings -- over time they sought elective offices			0
and some of them won			0
with each success , they inspire even more minorities of every race , ethnicity and religion to become active in our political system			1
so @entity7 , you 've had your great run			1
and there is no doubt that another white @entity17 will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the @entity183			1
but until that day comes , you can console yourself knowing that a white @entity17 male is one of the most exciting athletes in our nation today : @entity188			1
( of course , he is the back up to @entity190			0
) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

every president except for @entity196 and @entity16 has been a white @entity17
@entity193 : @entity7 have had an amazing run , but times have changed
he says political parties are increasingly reflecting the new face of @entity40
@entity193 : changing voting rights laws have made our political system more democratic
