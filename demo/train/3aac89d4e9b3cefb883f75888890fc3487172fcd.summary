-- last summer , @entity1 did n't want to go outside , or even open the door			2
she did n't want anyone to see she had lost her hair during breast cancer treatment			1
@entity1 , 39 , said she found strength from the support of her husband and children , and through an organization called @entity11 , a support network for @entity13 with cancer based in @entity15			1
at support meetings , she met other women who had lost their hair in cancer treatment and realized she was not alone			1
" they were going through the same , " said @entity1 , who moved to the @entity20 from @entity21 12 years ago and now lives in @entity22 , @entity23			2
" i say : they 're ok			0
it 's only the hair			0
it 's going to go grow back			0
" some @entity28 breast cancer survivors such as @entity1 have found comfort and assistance from organizations geared toward @entity28			1
@entity32 and other groups are trying to address needs such as breaking language barriers , paying for treatment and finding support from others going through similar challenges			1
@entity1 said she did n't know how she could have paid for treatment without @entity32			1
it introduced her to a @entity23 state program that covered her surgery , chemotherapy and radiation			0
" i may be not talking to you , " she said			0
" i do n't know			0
i do n't think i could have made it without all the help			0
" what the statistics say @entity51 remains a major health problem among @entity28 , but statistics show they are at a surprising advantage compared with some other ethnic groups			1
researchers are trying to figure out why			0
in the @entity20 , the death rate from all cancers among @entity28 is about 129 per 100,000 people per year , compared with 191 per 100,000 for whites and 239 per 100,000 for african - americans / blacks , according to the @entity63			1
breast cancer incidence and mortality specifically are also lower among @entity28 than whites or blacks , according to the @entity67			1
the figures are puzzling , given that @entity28 have a lower socioeconomic status on average than whites			1
data from the @entity73 suggests the typical @entity75 household had $ 6,325 in wealth in 2009 , while the typical white household had $ 113,149			1
even more curiously , a 2013 study in the @entity79 in @entity80 found that , among @entity28 in @entity82 , mortality rates for several cancers , including breast cancer , tend to be lower among those with more socioeconomic deprivation			1
a low mortality rate does not correspond with low socioeconomic status in whites and african - americans , the study found			1
more research needs to be done to confirm these findings			0
the phenomenon associating hispanics with better health outcomes despite lower average income and education rates is called the " hispanic paradox			1
" a possible explanation for this trend is that smoking is much less common among @entity28 than non-hispanic whites or african - americans , according to the @entity105			1
another theory is that people who immigrate to the @entity20 tend to be healthier than those who stayed in their home countries			0
it 's also possible that some who get sick return to their home countries			0
mentally ill @entity13 struggle to seek help despite slightly better statistical odds of not getting cancer than whites or blacks , @entity28 are not immune to these conditions , and breast cancer kills more @entity75 women than any other cancer			1
more often in hispanics than whites , breast cancer is detected at an advanced stage , according to the @entity67			1
a 2013 study in the journal @entity126 focusing on young women with breast cancer , ages 15 to 39 , found that the time between diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer differed significantly depending on the ethnicity of the participants			1
researchers found that about 15 % of @entity75 and @entity134 - @entity20 women waited more than six weeks for treatment , compared with 8 % of @entity137 white women			1
longer waiting periods are linked to shorter survival time , the study found			0
dr. @entity141 , breast oncologist at @entity143 in @entity144 , said she believes that access to health care is partly responsible for the later detection of breast cancer in @entity75 women			1
" if people have no health insurance , doing a test for something you do n't even have , it 's really at the bottom of the list , " she said			0
there are also , she said , " probably cultural reasons in which we may have more difficulty dealing with this and seeking medical attention			0
" what survivors say research is ongoing to narrow down the best ways to improve the quality of life among @entity75 breast cancer survivors and their caregivers			1
@entity32 is participating in a research project led by @entity170 at @entity171 to figure out the best approaches			0
the issues that tend to arise among @entity75 women who have breast cancer are n't unique to @entity28 , and it is impossible to generalize across individuals ; there are also many cultures that fall under terms such as " @entity75 " and " @entity28			1
" nonetheless , @entity180 and researchers have picked up on some themes that often arise			0
" breast cancer is n't always talked about in @entity28 families , " @entity170 said			1
" in some of these families , when you mention cancer it 's considered synonymous with death			1
" some survivors @entity170 has spoken with did n't tell their families about the cancer diagnosis until they had to start chemotherapy , because they did n't want to worry them			1
" for some of the women , when they did start talking about cancer , they were really pleasantly surprised at the amount of support and information that they received , " @entity170 said			1
for women whose first language is @entity204 , translation may be an issue			0
they may have a hard time finding a physician with whom they feel comfortable , and who can adequately explain treatment options and procedures			2
when family members step in to translate to doctors , some women hold back important details			0
for instance , one woman @entity180 met did n't tell her doctor about the problems with sexual functioning she was having during treatment , because her daughter was translating for her			2
let 's talk about sex ... and cancer in her study , @entity170 will be testing an intervention in which survivors and caregivers share their concerns separately , in different groups , led by a facilitator , and then everyone comes together to talk about the topic			2
when tried on a smaller scale , " ( facilitators ) delivered information separately to the survivors and caregivers ; it seemed that each group could open up further and talk about their own specific needs , " @entity170 said			0
getting help another community organization supporting @entity75 breast cancer patients is called @entity246 in @entity247 , @entity248			1
a comadre is a " non-biological close female kinship " in " the @entity75 / @entity28 extended family unit , " the website explains			1
this group was founded by six survivors and director @entity255 , who is also an assistant professor for research at the @entity258 @entity257			0
the organization works with women in a nonclinical setting , giving them resources and support during their breast cancer treatment			1
a grant from the @entity266 helped jump - start @entity246 a @entity267 in 2003			0
the organization offers support groups and classes in @entity204 and @entity273 , one - on - one support and financial assistance			2
comadre a @entity267 is trying to get out positive messages about screening and break down some of the cultural barriers			2
for instance , many women put the needs of the rest of their family before their own			0
" we need to be there for children and grandchildren ; it 's important we get in there and get those mammograms , " @entity255 said			0
@entity288 , a co-founder of @entity246 , had breast cancer in her mid- 40s			2
at the time , she had recently lost her mother to pancreatic cancer			2
the support group she tried did n't resonate with her ; she could n't connect with the women there , who had different backgrounds and life stories from her own			0
" not knowing the resources in the community , i had to basically support myself because i did n't know what the outcome was going to be , " @entity288 said			2
now she goes with women with recent diagnoses to their initial appointments for chemotherapy , radiation and surgery to help them navigate the system			0
helping patients navigate health care system some women are private about their struggle with cancer , so much so they do n't want to sit around other women who have it			2
@entity288 knows of one woman who moved because she did n't want anyone in her town to know she had cancer			2
when she learned about @entity11 , @entity1 immediately liked the idea of finding support in other women who also had cancer , but she held back at first in telling her parents in @entity21 until doctors were sure of what it was			2
" i did n't want my mom to get sad because she 's over there and i 'm here , " she said			0
" i did n't want to worry them			0
i took time to tell them			0
" clear of cancer , @entity1 is currently a @entity332 instructor through @entity11 , and loves teaching			2
the women in this organization have a lot of need , she said			0
they are , she said , her " sister survivors			0

@entity28 have a lower cancer incidence and mortality than whites and blacks
this phenomenon is part of what is called the " hispanic paradox "
financial and *linguistic* barriers in the @entity75 community can hinder treatment
