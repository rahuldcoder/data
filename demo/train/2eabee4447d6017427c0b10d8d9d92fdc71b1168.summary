@entity0 -- if a country 's standing can be measured by its sporting ambitions , then @entity3 's status as a superpower is once again on the rise			1
its big - spending football league is attracting top international stars , and the next few years will see it host major sporting spectacles for the first time since the @entity15 - era regime staged the 1980 @entity16 that were notoriously boycotted by the @entity17			2
and ahead of the @entity18 in @entity19 and the 2018 soccer @entity20 , one of @entity3 's prominent athletes has put aside her sporting dreams to concentrate on contributing to the politics of the @entity26			1
@entity27 was one of @entity3 's seemingly never ending line of top female tennis players when she burst onto the scene as a 17 - year - old in 2004			1
a junior finalist at @entity33 the previous year , she stunned compatriot and world no. 3 @entity34 at the @entity38 and went on to reach a career - high fifth in the rankings , winning eight tournaments and almost $ 4 million on the @entity42			2
however , she has now turned to politics after sliding outside the top 150 following a combination of injuries and illness			2
" i would like to develop youth sport			2
i was a sportsman myself so i know about problems in sport , " the 24 - year - old told @entity1			1
" i would like youth sport in our country to be affordable to people from all social classes			2
we have to give the same access to sport for kids from poor families			0
ideally , my goal is to get the majority involved in sport activities ... sport should come to every family			0
" @entity27 has chosen the fringe " @entity66 " as she stands for @entity3 's lower parliament in the december 4 elections , with parties needing 7 % of the total vote to earn seats			1
former top - ranked men 's tennis player @entity72 will also be standing , seeking one of 450 places			1
and they 'll both be hoping to join fellow sports figures @entity77 and @entity79 in the @entity80 after the two former @entity16 champion gymnasts won respective elections in 2007 formed in 2008 from the ashes of three other parties , @entity66 has positioned itself as " anti-old guard " and dismissed the relevancy of former president @entity87 and other longtime political stalwarts who have stood for decades			1
" it 's a challenge for me			0
i have joined @entity66 because it 's a young party with fresh ideas , " @entity27 said			1
" i was invited to join it when ( @entity93 ) @entity92 was in it			0
but even now all the basic ideas that the @entity66 stands for have n't changed and i share the program and idea of the party			1
" billionaire businessman @entity92 stepped down in september after a few months as party leader , dismissing @entity66 as a " puppet party " of the @entity26			1
it is an accusation @entity102 -- a reporter for @entity105 newspaper @entity104 and the first @entity107 journalist to be expelled from @entity3 since the end of the @entity109 in 2011 -- supports			1
" @entity3 was a quasi-democracy under @entity111 in the 1990s			2
but over the last decade - plus under @entity87 there has been a restoration of the classic authoritarian model , with the squashing of independent tv , proper elections , and opposition forces , " @entity102 , the author of " @entity119 : how one reporter became the enemy of a brutal new @entity3 , " told @entity1			1
" today 's @entity3 does have political ' parties , ' like @entity66			1
but they are not parties in the real sense -- their role is simply decorative , to create the illusion of voter choice and to legitimize decisions taken behind closed doors in the @entity26			2
" there 's a long tradition in @entity3 of getting sportsmen and women to stand for parties : they help to enthuse a weary and cynical electorate			1
" prime minister @entity87 has announced that next year he intends to again stand for president , a position he held for two consecutive terms -- the maximum allowed -- before endorsing the campaign of his 2008 successor @entity143			0
while her fellow @entity66 candidate @entity144 has listed @entity87 among the @entity3 establishment " we have had enough of , " @entity27 said the 59 - year - old -- who is a strong supporter of sport -- is popular with the people			1
" the real opposition is a constructive one that has something to offer to authorities [ other than ] beautiful election campaign slogans			0
i guess the @entity66 is able to become a constructive opponent , " she said			2
" as for the next president , @entity87 is really significantly supported by @entity3			2
if he is elected he will take the real steps for further development of the state and improving lifestyle for citizens , which is a good thing			0
the main thing is to keep on moving			0
" @entity27 said sport is an important part of becoming a healthy nation , and acknowledged that improvements need to be made before the big events in 2014 and 2018			1
" first we should develop the infrastructure -- build new stadiums , hotels , additional railway service and air travel , " she said			0
" we have to provide our guests and citizens with the highest level of security service			0
we must not lose face			0
big sport forums like this will definitely increase interest in sport and will contribute to the promotion of healthy lifestyles			0
" on the other hand it will make our authorities move and develop the infrastructure of territories where these competitions will take place , attract new investment into our country			0
" @entity27 has struggled to maintain the peak levels of 2007 , when she reached the @entity38 semifinals and was also part of @entity3 's successful @entity199 team , but she has not closed the door on her tennis career			1
" this year was really a tough one for me			0
there were several traumas and i decided to take care and restore my health , " she said			0
" it does n't mean that i 'm over with my sport career			0
i just took a pause for an unknown period of time			0
so all my goals now are related with this party project			0
