-- many people thought that the massacre of 20 young school children and six educators by a gunman wielding an assault weapon would change the terms of the debate over firearms regulation			1
it appears that they were wrong			2
not only does it now seem that @entity12 will not reinstate the assault weapons ban , but it also appears unlikely to place restrictions on the size of magazines so as to reduce the number of bullets that can be fired before reloading is required			1
for opponents of these measures , such a result would be vindication of what they argue is the absolute right to bear arms set forth in the @entity27			1
such arguments ignore the fact that in its 2008 decision recognizing that the @entity27 created a personal right to bear arms unrelated to serving in a militia , the @entity30 also recognized the permissibility of " reasonable " restrictions on that right , including potentially prohibiting carrying " dangerous and unusual weapons			1
" for others , however , a legislative outcome that includes neither an assault weapons ban nor restrictions on magazines is just more of the same -- a powerful lobby using aggressive tactics to persuade @entity12 to ignore majority support for these measures			1
i must say , however , that if this turns out to be the result , i will be sad but hardly shocked			0
gun bill filibuster ? in 1978 , while serving as the @entity54 official overseeing the @entity55 , we proposed regulations that would have created a centralized database of firearms transactions ( which would not have included the names of individual retail purchasers )			1
the purpose of such a database was to allow speedier tracing of firearms used in crimes and to allow the @entity55 to analyze the flow of firearms to particular dealers , which would suggest which dealers were diverting firearms to the illegal market			0
even though these proposals would have had no effect on anyone 's right to own any firearm , the @entity72 mounted a campaign against them , and @entity12 voted to prohibit any such database from ever being established , a prohibition that remains in effect today			1
during the debate over these regulations , i heard from some members of @entity12 that while the proposals made sense , politics precluded them from expressing support			1
thirty years later , it seems little has changed			0
so given this state of play , what should be the focus of those who believe that added regulations of firearms would help save lives ? despite emotions , little happens legislatively after mass shootings obviously , a first step is to continue to make the case for an assault weapons ban and limitations on the size of magazines			0
the issue , after all , should be not whether such steps avoid all mass shootings , but whether they could save some lives			0
would it not have been worth it even if some of those murdered in @entity112 could have survived because the shooter did not have an assault weapon ? but there are other things that can and should be done : 1			0
we need to work to ensure that @entity12 at least finally creates a system of universal background checks for all firearms purchasers			1
many people believe such a system exists today ; it does not			2
along with such a system , we need to improve the databases used in connection with such checks			1
focus should be placed on what is happening in particular states			0
for example , states such as @entity131 and @entity132 have made meaningful changes in gun laws in response to the spate of recent mass shootings , and other states have meaningful restrictions on firearms possession			2
it is true , however , that attitudes toward guns are different in different regions of the country			0
if certain states choose to have fewer firearms regulations , those choices should not be allowed to interfere with the policy decisions of those states that decide that a safer society requires more firearms regulations and fewer guns on the streets			0
yet this is precisely what happens now where guns sold in low - or no - regulation states end up on the streets of those cities and states with far stricter regulation			2
thus , we need -- as is being proposed -- to toughen the laws on " straw man " purchases and firearms trafficking and to make it a federal crime to transport a gun into a state where possession of that gun would be illegal			2
congressionally imposed restrictions placed on @entity55 's ability to enforce existing laws should be removed			0
this includes ending the ban on the creation of a centralized firearms transaction database , but also ending restrictions like the ban on @entity55 's ability to require gun dealers to conduct annual inventories to determine whether firearms have been lost or stolen			2
( unfortunately we are instead seeing moves to make these kinds of restrictions permanent			0
) opponents of new firearms regulations often argue that existing laws should be enforced before we pass new ones			0
unfortunately , @entity12 is too often pressed to impose rules that make such enforcement less effective			1
opinion : more gun mayhem , and yet we wait for action in the end , a sensible approach to gun violence would , among other non-law enforcement steps , include prohibitions directed at assault - type weapons , more regulation of handguns , less regulation of traditional long guns and working to make sure that federal , state and local law enforcement have the tools to enforce the laws relating to firearms			2
unfortunately , logic does not always operate when the topic is guns			0
