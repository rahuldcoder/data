dueling official @entity2 responses to tuesday 's @entity3 meant to highlight the party 's alternate vision for the nation instead underscored the @entity2 's deep divide on immigration reform			1
one , given in @entity9 by @entity11 rep. @entity10 , asked the president to " cooperate " with congressional @entity2 to make immigration reform happen			1
" we should also work through the appropriate channels to create permanent solutions for our immigration system , to secure our borders , modernize legal immigration , and strengthen our economy , " @entity10 said in @entity9			2
" in the past , the president has expressed support for ideas like these			0
now we ask him to cooperate with us to get it done			0
" the other , delivered in @entity26 by @entity28 sen. @entity27 , made no mention of reform			1
she gave a folksy pitch for @entity2 proposals to improve the economy , overhaul the tax code and open up new trade markets abroad			2
while @entity10 and @entity27 were the two officially - sanctioned @entity2 responses , a cacophony of republicans spanning the ideological spectrum gave their own rebuttals throughout the night			1
@entity41 @entity2 had said @entity10 would be delivering a @entity9 translation of @entity27 's speech in a press release that went out last week , but by wednesday morning , that note had been deleted from the release			1
@entity10 told @entity47 he requested a copy of @entity27 's prepared remarks and revised them to reflect his own priorities , and that @entity51 had okayed his version of the speech			2
" i did not get any pushback whatsoever , " he said			0
the freshman @entity41 @entity2 said it was " a shame that @entity56 would try to criticize us for each of us having our own priorities and ideas and making them known			0
" " i think leadership should be commended for encouraging those it selects to talk about their lives , their priorities and their vision , " he said			0
but the clash between the two speeches reflects the broader struggle within the party to expand its appeal beyond base conservatives and into untapped demographic groups , particularly minorities			1
with @entity79 's @entity78 population growing exponentially , @entity2 leaders have openly admitted they wo n't be able to compete on the national stage if they ca n't figure out how to narrow @entity56 ' advantage with that voting bloc			0
@entity84 @entity2 sen. @entity83 , who has expressed interest in a presidential bid , told @entity0 last month that it would be " difficult , if not impossible " for the @entity2 to win the @entity41 in 2016 without passing immigration reform			1
many in the party 's right flank , however , remain staunchly opposed to any reform proposals that include a pathway to citizenship for immigrants here illegally , which conservatives decry as " amnesty			0
" @entity27 herself was a loud opponent of a pathway to citizenship during her campaign , and said she would 've opposed the 2013 @entity105 reform bill for that reason			0
@entity10 , meanwhile , supported that bill during his campaign and bucked @entity2 on a pair of amendments meant to block president @entity112 's executive action on amnesty last week , voting against them			2
but both @entity2 hail from competitive swing states , and represent voting blocs that could be key to the @entity2 's hopes of winning the @entity41 in 2016			0
their disconnect on the immigration reform issue suggests the party still has a ways to go in bridging the gulf between the two .			1

@entity28 sen. @entity27 and @entity11 rep. @entity10 gave *divergent* sotu responses for the @entity2
@entity10 mentioned immigration reform as a priority , while @entity27 did n't mention it at all
the disconnect reflects a broader struggle within the @entity2 to appease its base while reaching out to minority voters
