-- there was a time when the @entity3 was strictly for @entity4			2
it was an alliance between @entity6 and twice born followers of the @entity8 , all firmly opposed to mass @entity10 immigration from @entity11			2
the nativism of the @entity3 drove @entity13 into the welcoming arms of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity18			1
but this year 's @entity3 front - runners are a @entity20 and two @entity13 -- @entity21 ( a cradle of @entity24 descent ) and @entity25 ( a convert )			1
roughly one - quarter of @entity3 primary voters are @entity10			1
notable catholic @entity3 leaders include @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
six out of nine justices of the @entity35 are @entity13 , and five of them are @entity3			1
the @entity3 is undergoing a quiet process of @entity38			0
it 's one of the reasons why this year 's race has focused so much on social issues -- and sex			1
@entity3 outreach to @entity13 began in the early 1970s , when @entity45 tried to entice blue - collar " white ethnics " to the @entity3 by taking a tough stand on abortion			1
@entity45 told members of his staff he was tempted to convert to @entity10 himself , but was worried it would be seen as cheap politics : " they would say there goes @entity45 trying to win the @entity10 vote			0
... " @entity45 genuinely admired the @entity10 intellectual tradition and its ability to provide reasonable arguments to defend conservative values at a time when they were undergoing widespread reappraisal			2
that certainly made the @entity13 an invaluable partner during the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s			0
when the @entity68 was established in 1979 to oppose things like abortion and homosexual rights , its evangelical founders did their best to include @entity13			2
despite the organization 's reputation for being the political voice box of televangelists and peddlers of the apocalypse , by the mid ' 80s it drew a third of its funding from @entity10 donors			2
leaders like @entity83 and @entity84 consciously used the @entity68 ( and , later , the @entity85 ) as an exercise in ecumenical coalition building			0
@entity83 and @entity84 were fans of @entity89 and his resilient anti-communism			0
but they also recognized , like @entity45 , that the @entity13 had a vast intellectual heritage that could be drawn upon when fighting the liberals			0
for example , when debating abortion , evangelicals had hitherto tended to rely on @entity97 to make their case			0
@entity13 , on the other hand , had been integrating the concept of " human rights " into their theology since the 1890s			2
under @entity10 influence , the pro-life movement evolved from a zealous , theology - heavy rationale to one more couched in the language of human dignity and personhood			1
by 2000 , catholic social teaching was a core component of the @entity3 's " compassionate conservatism " agenda			1
@entity114 targeted religious @entity13 on behalf of @entity115 , while the president made a big play of his social traditionalism			1
in the 2004 election , @entity33 beat @entity120 among @entity13 , despite the fact that @entity120 described himself as a faithful @entity10 who never went anywhere without his rosary beads			1
crucially , @entity33 's victory among @entity13 was made possible by his margin of support among those who attend @entity128 regularly			2
catholics who said they rarely went to church plumped for @entity120			0
the election heralded a new split within the politics of the communion , between religious and ethnic @entity13			0
indeed , it could be argued that just as @entity3 @entity136 have become a little more catholic in their outlook , so conservative @entity13 have become a little more @entity136 in theirs			1
@entity21 is part of the @entity89 generation of @entity13 who reject most of the liberalism that swept the church in the 1960s			0
he is a member of a suburban church in @entity145 , @entity146 , that ( unusually , nowadays ) offers a @entity128 each sunday with a @entity148 chant sung by a professional choir			0
the church has a " garden for the unborn " and has boasted as worshipers the director of the @entity151 , the head of the @entity152 and justice @entity153			0
@entity21 is also an outspoken admirer of @entity157 , the founder of the conservative lay organization @entity158			0
@entity158 encourages among its members a work ethic and an effort to " live like a saint " that is strikingly similar to the values and mores of @entity168 's @entity167 settlers			0
@entity21 's political theology has thus moved him so sharply to the right that it 's sometimes difficult to culturally identify him as a @entity10			1
in a march 18 survey , less than half of @entity3 @entity13 actually knew the candidate was himself a @entity10			1
that might be one of the reasons why @entity21 consistently loses to @entity177 among @entity13 in primaries , even during his landmark victories in the @entity180			2
in contrast , he does very well among evangelicals			0
we might speculate that what is emerging is an alliance between ultra-conservative @entity13 and tea party evangelicals			1
its politics might be antediluvian , but it 's an ecumenical breakthrough and a cultural revolution at the grass - roots level			0
the coalition 's mix of catholic moral teaching and evangelical fervor has oriented the 2012 @entity3 race toward fierce social conservatism			1
during the debate over @entity201 's contraception mandate , it was the @entity10 conservative leadership who provided the moral objection , but the evangelicals who produced most of the popular opposition to it			1
and it is evangelical support that has elevated @entity21 to his current status in the race			0
with its ability to shift the agenda and win primaries , the emerging @entity10 / evangelical political theology is the most striking conservative innovation of this turbulent campaign season			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			0

@entity219 : the @entity3 party was once *dominated* by *protestants*
he says @entity13 and @entity10 theology now play a key role in the @entity3
@entity219 : conservative catholics have led the party 's social issues *conversation*
he says social issues play a key role in primaries , *due* to catholic - evangelical alliance
