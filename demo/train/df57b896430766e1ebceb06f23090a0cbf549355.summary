-- @entity1 is demanding that documentary filmmaker @entity3 hand over footage of the movie he made about five men who were wrongfully imprisoned and later exonerated for the rape of a woman in @entity9			1
the demand is part of the city 's attempt to defend itself against multi-million dollar federal lawsuits filed by some of the " the @entity16 , " as the exonerated men had come to be known			1
lawyers for @entity1 filed a subpoena demanding @entity3 and his production company , @entity21 , give them the unpublished interviews and unreleased footage not used in the documentary , which premiered at the @entity25 in may			1
" the plaintiffs ' interviews go to the heart of the case and can not be obtained elsewhere , " said @entity26 , a city attorney			1
but @entity3 , along with his daughter , @entity32 , and her husband @entity33 , who co-wrote and produced the film , say they plan to fight			2
" i 'm sorry to say we saw this coming , " said @entity3			0
" @entity39 shield laws are very specific			0
we are journalists , and that 's what this is			1
" @entity3 was referring to state laws designed to protect journalists from having to compromise their sources			0
the filmmaker says he finds irony in the city 's request for the footage because he says he and his crew had been trying to get city officials in front of the camera for interviews for years , but to no avail			1
" we made every attempt , we practically begged to talk to prosecutors and police , " he said			1
the shield law should not protect @entity61 and his collaborators because they have shown many times that they were advocates and not journalists , city officials say			1
for example , @entity32 worked for two years in the law firm of one of the plaintiffs ' attorneys and @entity3 wrote to mayor @entity71 in 2009 , urging him to settle the case , writing the plaintiffs had " suffered without just cause , " the @entity1 law office says			1
" mr. @entity3 and his daughter have publicly sided with the plaintiffs and their families , who are seeking hundreds of millions from @entity1 , " said @entity26 , " the movie has crossed from documentary to pure advocacy			1
under such circumstances , no reasonable person could have expected us to participate in their project			0
" @entity3 , an emmy - award winning filmmaker , disagrees			1
" we did n't make an advocacy film ; we made a film about the facts of the case and that is these men were wrongly convicted , and had years of their lives stolen , " @entity3 said			2
" one of the things that was stolen from these men was their humanity			0
in the media they were turned into wild beasts , a wolf pack , and we wanted to return their humanity			0
we 'd have been happy to do the same to others involved , if prosecutors and police had returned our calls for interviews			0
" the racially charged @entity16 case dates back to 1989			1
on april 19 of that year , a 28 - year - old white @entity108 investment banker was jogging through @entity9 when she was brutally assaulted , raped and left for dead			2
that same night a group of black and @entity111 boys had been in the park , throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people , " wilding " as it was called in the media at the time			2
2003 : @entity9 jogger speaks out in the ensuing months , the investigation lead to the arrest of five of the boys			0
they were charged and convicted			0
to many it seemed like an open and shut case			2
four of the young men had given taped confessions , and despite defense claims the confessions were coerced , the prosecutors , police , and what seemed like much of the @entity129 public deemed them guilty			0
@entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 were convicted and sentenced to prison			0
in 2002 , three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms , one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when @entity134 , a serial rapist and murderer , confessed to the crime and said he acted alone			0
dna analysis later determined that @entity150 did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys ' trials did not match			0
@entity155 , the @entity156 district attorney at the time , ordered a new investigation and , on his recommendation , a judge vacated the convictions			0
legal expert say the city may have a case			1
" the evidence exists , the tapes and footage exists , and these people are suing the city , so you can see why the city would want to use them , " said @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity164			2
@entity164 : case shows injustice can happen			2

@entity1 's demand stems from an attempt to defend against lawsuits
the filmmaker says he is fighting the city 's request
the so - called @entity16 case dates back to 1989
