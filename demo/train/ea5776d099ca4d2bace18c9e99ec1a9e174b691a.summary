-- @entity1 friday began hosting live streams			1
but do n't go looking for how to get your basement version of @entity5 on the internet just yet : for now , this power is reserved for pre-approved " trusted partners , " not for the kitten - on - the - keyboard masses			2
@entity1 is n't saying just how many live casters it will enable from day one but that it intends " to provide thousands of partners with the capability to live stream from their channels in the months ahead			1
" it 's clear from the new @entity18 page that there is more than enough to get the ball rolling with quantity and variety			0
an especially nice touch ? you can add an upcoming live stream to your calendar			2
@entity1 has hosted a small number of " event " live streams , but this is the first time it is getting into territory pioneered by such players as @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
unlike these services , however , there is no mobile functionality for @entity1 streamers yet , so nothing will come from smartphones or tablets			1
limiting participants , requiring a certain kind of encoder and keeping it out of the mobile space are all part of what @entity49 says in an attempt to ensure a level of quality			0
but it will also help minimize the chances of " @entity57 moments " for a service which , despite the vast volume of material it accepts and hosts , still studiously tries to keep nsfw material off its site			0
