-- how free are you to say what you think and what you believe ? how free are you to hear the views of others , of those who challenge widely held beliefs or dare to criticize the powerful ? upon the answer to that question lies the essence and the soul of democracy			1
that 's why today we have more conclusive evidence that democracy is faltering in @entity16 and why we see alarming signs that the revolution in @entity19 may lead not toward , but away from , the democratic path			1
it 's also why we have reason to feel encouraged about the prospects for change in @entity25 ( formerly known as @entity25 ) and why we know that , despite populist claims , democracy in places such as @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 -- the country that offered asylum to @entity34 ' @entity33 -- is either dead , dying or suffering a serious illness			1
and it 's why we know that @entity38 has not a shred of democratic rule			2
when @entity16 authorities decided to throw the book at three punk - rock performers from the provocatively named group @entity45 , the issue was always democracy or , rather , lack of it			1
prosecutors charged the three -- @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 -- with hooliganism and religious incitement after they staged their iconoclastic show earlier this year in @entity56			2
the three burst onto the altar of the city 's @entity58 , wearing their trademark face covers and brightly colored balaclavas , and spent 40 seconds chanting their song " @entity69 , @entity70 , " which later became part of their @entity66 hit " @entity68			2
" the performance was meant to shock			0
but , more than anything , it was an act of protest			0
like others in @entity16 , they were taking on the increasingly authoritative rule of president @entity78			1
and , in this case , they wanted to draw attention , they said , to the church 's growing role in politics			2
normally , the disruptive show would have received a fine , charges of disturbing the peace or disrupting a religious service			2
but in today 's @entity16 , you can not take on the president without serious consequences			1
the women of @entity45 gained notoriety partly for the name of their group and their colorful antics			1
but their case is only the most highly publicized of a number of terrible abuses of the law against critics of the president			2
@entity104 , one of the most popular of @entity78 's detractors , has been charged with embezzlement on what many people believe are trumped up charges			1
@entity111 critic @entity110 remains in a @entity113 prison , where he has been since 2005 after daring to challenge @entity78 's authority			1
countless @entity16 journalists have died mysterious deaths , as have anti-corruption crusaders , such as @entity118			1
opposition leader @entity119 , the former chess champion , has come under physical attack attacking the opposition , imprisoning one 's critics is one way to tighten one 's hold on power			1
but there is no better way to maintain the perception of democracy than by controlling what the people -- the voters -- are allowed to hear and read and think			2
that 's why restricting freedom of expression , especially media freedoms , is the favorite sport of authoritarian governments that want to preserve the appearance of democratic legitimacy			2
winning an election could confer democratic legitimacy			0
but what happens when the opposition does n't have access to the media ? what happens when journalists are not free to criticize the government ? that 's when democracy dies , even if it lives in a zombie state , with leaders elected by voters with access only to views in support of the regime or where the president 's critics are smeared , ridiculed and maligned , as happens in far too many places			1
in @entity19 , which has its first elected president , there is evidence of a move to stifle criticism and bring a single point of view to the public			1
when the newspaper @entity172 ran a list of accusations against the @entity175 , from whose ranks president @entity176 rose , authorities removed every issue from the stands			0
the paper 's editor , @entity180 , is one of several journalists charged with insulting the president			2
@entity180 says the @entity175 wants to " silence any opposition to their policies			0
" the @entity187 , dominated by @entity189 legislators , just hand - picked 50 newspaper editors for state - owned publications			0
@entity176 named a @entity175 activist , @entity192 , as information minister , adding to fears among many journalists that @entity196 will gain control of the media			0
in @entity30 , the country whose democratically elected president has embraced @entity34 's @entity33 , a self - described champion of freedom of expression , journalists say president @entity205 has launched a campaign of fear and intimidation to stifle criticism			1
@entity30 's mind - boggling media law prohibits reports and even editorials that " have a bearing , in favor of or against a specific candidate , proposal , option , electoral preference or political thesis			1
" the @entity220 calls it " coerced pre-emption " and says it adds to a program of smear campaigns and defamation laws aimed at producing self - censorship			0
self - censorship , of course , is the ultimate desired result			0
when the government does n't have to imprison or harass its critics anymore because no one dares criticize it , then democracy is only skin deep , no matter how free elections appear			1
then , few dare to criticize the government , and voters are exposed to glowing reviews of their leader 's prowess and wisdom			0
it 's easy to win elections that way			0
@entity30 is following the model put in place by @entity29 , where president @entity248 imposed the law on @entity250 in @entity251 and @entity252 , complete with multimillion dollar fines and shutting down of outlets that run afoul of the government			1
to keep a patina of democratic freedom , some opposition is allowed to function , but the playing field is sharply tilted			0
those tactics are much more subtle than @entity28 's , where the government has thrown scores of journalists in prison			0
the regime has not only imprisoned and tortured journalists , it has also shut down newspapers , blocked websites and jammed satellite signals			0
the government now says it plans to stop using the internet by 2013 because it is " untrustworthy			0
" sadly , restrictions on freedom of expression , one of the most fundamental of all human rights , are much more widespread than most people realize			0
according to @entity279 , a human rights advocacy group , only 14.5 % of the world 's people live in places with true media freedom			0
the encouraging news in all of this is that the efforts of authoritarian regimes to silence their critics highlight the power of words , the power of free expression and the importance even they place on having democratic legitimacy			0
that remains a powerful incentive for advocates of democracy to keep up their fight			1
if they lose the battle to pry open the flow of ideas , they will lose the struggle for democracy , because even when a president is elected , if the people are not free to criticize him and his policies , then democracy is a mirage -- and so is freedom			1

@entity321 : @entity16 , @entity19 , other " populist " states show faltering democracy in stifled speech
she says @entity45 *sentence* and jailing of @entity78 critics are recent examples
she says @entity30 , @entity29 , @entity19 use laws , intimidation to " coercively pre-empt " criticism
@entity336 : democracy real only if it allows the powerful flow of ideas ; without that , it 's a mirage
