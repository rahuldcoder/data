-- @entity2 's @entity1 , inhabited by some 30 @entity4 tribes , has long been a lawless land that serves as a buffer between @entity2 and @entity7			1
but it is now drawing comparisons to the ungoverned tribal regions of @entity13 as networks of @entity4 tribes , @entity1 's criminal elements and radical islamists have begun to capitalize on @entity2 's post-revolution security vacuum by increasingly engaging in drug and arms smuggling , human trafficking and terrorism			1
the escalating lawlessness in the @entity1 risks turning the region into a powder keg			0
@entity2 's domestic power struggle has implications for all nations in the region			1
post-arab @entity29 instability has increased @entity7 's concerns about its own security , concerns that will probably grow no matter who is in charge in @entity35			2
as a member of the @entity38 , i am concerned about the threat that @entity41 's nuclear program poses to @entity7			0
however , instability in the @entity1 is also a growing threat to @entity7 and @entity2 's security			1
the @entity7 - @entity2 peace treaty , which has provided security and balanced tensions in the region since 1978 , is at risk			1
human trafficking in the @entity1 has become a human rights nightmare			1
while leading a congressional delegation visit to @entity7 and @entity2 this summer , i learned about the steady and growing flow of @entity55 migrants from @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 who are desperate to get to @entity7 and @entity59 in search of economic opportunity			2
but these migrants are increasingly waylaid in the @entity1 desert by @entity4 tribes , for whom hostage - taking has become a flourishing business			0
while a few years ago a migrant might be ransomed for $ 3,000 , the going price today is more than 10 times that amount			0
thousands of refugees are being held captive and subjected to torture , forced labor and rape , while those who can not pay for their release are often murdered			0
the @entity1 powder keg nearly exploded in august after @entity77 militants in @entity1 attacked near the southern @entity7 city of @entity79 , killing and wounding @entity7 soldiers and civilians			0
while pursuing the attackers , @entity7 forces killed several @entity2 security guards , which then sparked attacks on the @entity7 embassy in @entity35 and led to @entity2 demands for an end to the peace treaty			2
@entity7 has stepped up its military deployment on its side of the border			0
we have also seen recent attacks on and abductions of members of the @entity97 , whose important peacekeeping mission -- established by treaty protocol -- will be increasingly difficult to accomplish amid unraveling security on the peninsula			0
recently , southern @entity7 has seen rocket attacks from the @entity1 , as well as an attack by militants who crossed from the @entity1 into @entity7 and opened fire on @entity7 civilians			0
while @entity7 is building a barrier along part of the @entity1 border , that can not stop all attacks , and one deadly rocket fired from the @entity1 could be enough to kill the peace treaty altogether and ignite a regional war			2
it is critical that we engage the @entity7 and @entity2 in joint discussions on security in the @entity1 and on preserving the @entity97 ' mission			1
the @entity2 military should be urged to reinforce checkpoints on the borders between mainland @entity2 and the @entity1 in order to stop the flow of arms and crack down on human trafficking			1
@entity2 's new government must respect the country 's commitments to combat human trafficking under international conventions as well as domestic law			1
corruption is a big obstacle to these common - sense solutions			0
but a renewed focus on bolstering the long - term economic prospects of the peninsula could begin to address the underlying problems			1
highlighting the @entity1 's human rights horrors could also be a focus of the @entity143 administration 's @entity141 , which is intended to encourage robust multilateral efforts to prevent and respond to atrocities , something that should bring all nations together			1
ultimately , however , a new @entity2 government needs to understand that a lawless @entity1 only undermines @entity2 interests			2
the administration must make clear to all in the region , but especially to the @entity2 , that they have a common interest in preserving the peace			0

@entity2 's @entity1 is becoming more lawless , sen. @entity156 says
instability there *jeopardizes* the *34* - year - old peace between @entity2 and @entity7 , he says
@entity156 : human trafficking in the @entity1 has become a human rights nightmare
bolstering the @entity1 's long - term economic prospects could begin to help , @entity156 says
