@entity0 -- despite mounting pressure from @entity4 colleagues to resign over the sexting scandal that dominated the headlines this week , embattled rep. @entity7 insists he 's staying in office			1
among other things , the @entity10 congressman can point to a @entity13 poll released thursday showing that a majority of registered voters in his district -- 56 % -- do n't believe he should step down			1
only 33 % believe he should go			0
assuming @entity7 stays , the question now becomes whether the @entity21 ethics panel will heed @entity4 leader @entity23 's call for an investigation of the case			1
it involves whether @entity7 used government resources in sending lewd photos and sexual - tinged messages in his online communications with several women , and his series of lies when news of what he was doing became public			2
the known facts so far do n't suggest any criminal violations by @entity7 , said @entity38 , a @entity39 law professor , in an interview thursday with @entity1			1
all of @entity7 's sexting appeared to be with adults , while prosecution usually focuses on people transmitting pornographic materials to children , @entity38 noted			1
in addition , @entity7 never called for a federal investigation of the case and therefore avoided one of the biggest dangers of prosecution -- lying to federal investigators , @entity38 said			1
" i think that the odds are ... that he wo n't be criminally charged , " he said			0
on the other hand , a congressional investigation by the @entity57 , formerly known as the @entity58 , could be a costly and politically charged process lasting for months and perhaps years			0
@entity38 noted that the ethics panel has a reputation for being " toothless , " and he questioned the wisdom of prosecuting a legislator for a private act , saying it opened the door to future investigations based on lifestyle or other non-legal issues			0
however , @entity38 noted that @entity21 rules prohibit conduct that discredits the chamber , and that @entity7 's most obvious misconduct appeared to be lying publically by initially claiming his @entity75 account had been hacked by someone who posted a lewd photo to a 21 - year - old college student in @entity79			1
@entity7 later admitted he sent the photo			2
@entity23 asked for the ethics committee to investigate in order to pressure @entity7 to resign , according to @entity4 sources			1
her letter to the top @entity85 and @entity86 on the @entity21 ethics panel noted that @entity7 had " disclosed conduct which he described as inappropriate			1
" " an investigation by the @entity91 to determine whether the @entity92 have been violated is warranted , " @entity23 said in the letter			2
as pressure built for some indication about the @entity91 's intentions , the panel 's @entity85 chairman and ranking @entity4 member issued a statement this week underscoring their duty to impartiality and confidentiality			2
the statement made no mention of @entity7			0
" if and when an investigation is appropriate in any matter , the @entity58 will carry out its responsibilities pursuant to our rules and with the utmost integrity and fairness , " said the statement from @entity105			0
@entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115 , @entity116			0
" pursuant to our rules of confidentiality , we will not have any further comment at this time			0
" to @entity122 , a lawyer who formerly served as @entity21 general counsel and has participated in ethics committee investigations , the request by @entity23 for an investigation made no sense			1
there was no criminal violation , @entity122 said , and focusing on @entity7 's case will set an undesirable precedent			1
" why these @entity4 think it 's a good idea to turn internet peccadilloes into ethics violations , i do n't understand , " @entity122 told @entity1			1
" the world is using these devices , and they 're going to be sinking their own boats when they do it			0
" the prospect of months of expensive legal wrangling over his private life was supposed to persuade @entity7 to step down in order to end the sensational news headlines that @entity4 say are distracting from their messaging on @entity146 reform and other issues			1
now that @entity7 appears likely to stay in office , it is unclear whether the ethics panel will decide to launch an investigation			1
no specific ethics rules deal with social media such as @entity75 , which is one of the forms of online communications involved in the @entity7 case			2
while lying to evade detection would be considered inappropriate , it is not a violation likely to bring significant punishment			0
@entity162 , a political analyst for the @entity163 , said @entity23 's call for an ethics investigation was necessary for both procedural and political reasons			1
" @entity7 's actions raise clear questions about whether he used government resources for his shenanigans , " @entity162 told @entity1 , and @entity23 's request also sent " a clear signal of disapproval of the leadership			1
" " it stands in stark contrast with the muted response @entity183 and @entity21 @entity85 leaders had to @entity185 's confessions , and to the allegations against @entity187 , " @entity162 's e-mail said of cases involving sexual misconduct and other alleged violations by @entity85 legislators			2
" if @entity7 stays , it is clear that it will be without much backing in any fashion , public or private , from his @entity4 colleagues , " @entity162 said in the e-mail			1
@entity7 has said he welcomed the investigation , which could go in a number of directions			2
the committee could find that the congressman , however repugnant his actions , did nothing to violate @entity21 rules			2
or it could find that he damaged the reputation of the @entity21 and recommend a fine and possibly a reprimand			0
more seriously , @entity7 could be censured			0
the most serious penalty would be expulsion , something rarely recommended			0
at most , @entity7 is likely going to receive a letter admonishing him for his behavior , predicted @entity210 , executive director of @entity211 in @entity0			0
" the best you 've got ( so far ) is that his behavior does n't reflect credibly on the @entity21			2
but that 's a pretty vague charge , and ( the ethics committee does n't ) use that every time a politician lies			2
otherwise they 'd be pretty busy			0
" @entity210 noted that @entity21 rules allow for use of government property such as phones for personal purposes as long as an extra cost is not incurred by taxpayers			0
both democrats and @entity85 will feel a degree of " discomfort " dealing with @entity7 's case , @entity210 said			1
there is a " real danger to saying sexual misconduct is something the committee 's going to investigate , " she noted , raising the specter of possible sexual improprieties on the part of other members			0
theoretically , the ethics committee is supposed to act as a non-partisan judicial body , she added			0
but it 's impossible to completely eliminate political considerations from the committee 's deliberations			0
@entity7 's fellow @entity10 @entity86 , rep. @entity243 , was censured by the @entity21 last december after being found guilty on 11 counts of violating @entity21 rules , including a failure to pay taxes on a vacation home and improperly using his office to raise money for an educational center bearing his name			1
@entity4 support for @entity243 , a former chairman of the powerful tax law - writing @entity254 , eroded over time due to a steady stream of new allegations of misconduct and , according to some observers , a poor response to investigators			0
" if the scandal deepens with additional revelations , the pressure on @entity7 to resign will increase , " said @entity262 , a @entity263 political scientist			1
@entity1 's @entity267 contributed to this report			0
