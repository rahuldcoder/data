the first week of a lawsuit seeking to reform @entity2 's stop - and - frisk policy featured emotional accounts from men who say police stopped them for no reason and @entity8 officers who say mandated quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops			1
the federal class - action lawsuit , @entity12 , claims police routinely stop minority men without a legal reason			1
it was filed in 2008			2
officer @entity17 , an eight - year veteran of the @entity8 who works in the @entity19 , testified tuesday that he was told at a daily roll call that he had to log at least five stop - and - frisks , make one arrest and write 20 tickets each month , according to @entity25 affiliate @entity24			1
" they said , ' you do it or you are going to become a @entity30 deliveryman , ' " @entity17 said			2
" i started recording it because i could not believe what i was hearing			0
" @entity8 report : most of those ' stopped and frisked ' are minorities the practice in which police stop , question and frisk people they consider suspicious has been widely criticized , but the police department says it is used to deter crime			1
according to the @entity43 , the @entity8 logged its 5 millionth stop - and - frisk under mayor @entity45 last week			1
@entity19 police officer @entity46 also taped discussions with supervisors during the daily roll call starting in 2010			1
both officers said it was during these roll calls that their supervisors would urge them and their fellow officers to write more summonses , make stop - and - frisk stops and make arrests			1
in the recordings , which were played in court by the plaintiffs ' lawyers , supervising officers can be heard saying they want " more 250s , " referring to the form that officers fill out when they conduct a stop , question and frisk			1
" if you do n't want to be on a foot post , get a collar ( an arrest ) , " supervisors also said in a recording played on thursday			1
lawyers for the city dismissed the talk of quotas			1
during cross-examination they pointed to the fact that police supervisors suggested @entity17 and other officers might be slacking off on the job			1
in a recording @entity46 made in february 2013 , an inspector can be heard talking about stop - and - frisks , saying that officers need to stop " the right people at the right time in the right location			1
" later in the recording , @entity46 and his superior have a conversation about @entity91 , a notoriously high - crime area in the south @entity19 that the inspector says has had many problems with robberies and grand larcenies			2
he continues to say , " the problem was what ? male blacks			2
and i told you that at roll call , and i have no problem telling you this : male blacks 14 to 20			1
" city attorneys say that officers operate within the law , going where the crime is , and that crime happens to be higher in minority neighborhoods			1
department deputy chief @entity110 testified friday that when he was overseeing the 75th precinct in @entity112 , he had to set a goal of 10 summonses and one arrest per month because the officers were performing poorly			2
" department managers can and must set performance goals , " @entity110 said			0
while performance goals are legal , under a state law that was revised in 2010 , quotas are not			0
@entity46 , a nine - year police veteran , got choked up when asked why he came forward with the allegations of stop - and - frisk quotas in the @entity8			2
" as a @entity125 walking in the @entity19 , i 've been stopped many times , and it 's not a good feeling , " he said			0
" as an officer , i said i would respect everyone to the best of my abilities			0
i just want to do the right thing			0
" @entity46 said he faced retaliation from his superiors for refusing to meet the quotas			0
" i would have a day off and they 'd give me forced ( overtime ) , " he said to the court			0
" i would get yelled at , get low evaluations , they would deny days off			0
" and after he complained about this alleged treatment to internal affairs , he said fellow officers plastered his locker with stickers of rats			0
earlier in the week , teen witness @entity148 testified that when he was 13 he was illegally stopped , questioned and frisked , according to @entity24			0
" i want to be a voice to fight against the injustices of some of the @entity8 , " @entity148 said			0
@entity152 , 24 , testified that he has been stopped multiple times , once in 2011 while walking to the store to get some milk			0
he said he feared for the safety of his siblings after the officers took his keys and went into his apartment building			0
according to plaintiffs ' attorneys , the lawsuit is not about putting an end to stop - and - frisk , but examines how the police department conducts those stops and whether it stops blacks and @entity169 in violation of the @entity171			1
the @entity172 , a nonprofit civil rights law practice , is arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs			2
the lawsuit seeks to reform stop - and - frisk under the supervision of a court - appointed monitor			2
the lead plaintiff in the case is @entity182 , a medical student who was stopped twice , once in the middle of the afternoon when he was in front of his home in the @entity19 , according to the suit			0
" we need somebody to look over the shoulder of the police department , not in an overly aggressive way , but in a limited way to make sure that this practice is being done in a constitutional fashion , " said plaintiff attorney @entity187			2
city council speaker @entity196 said this week that council members have reached a " broad agreement " on a bill to have an office within the city 's @entity201 that would be allowed to subpoena police officials and documents			1
the trial is expected to last four to six weeks and is scheduled to reconvene on wednesday			0
the outcome will be decided by @entity208 district judge @entity207 .			0

police testify they were ordered to intercept 5 people a month
supervisors can be heard giving orders during recorded roll calls
plaintiffs in lawsuit say blacks , @entity169 *unconstitutionally* singled out
city *maintains* *method* is being used to deter crime
