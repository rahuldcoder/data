when word started spreading last week that @entity3 women -- already some of the most oppressed and restricted in the world -- were being monitored electronically as they left the country , activists were quick to express their outrage			1
" it 's very shameful , " said @entity7 , who became an icon of female empowerment in 2011 after defying the conservative kingdom 's driving ban and encouraging other @entity3 women to do the same			1
@entity14 was one of the first prominent @entity3 to start tweeting about the electronic monitoring issue -- describing the shock experienced by a couple she knew after the husband received a text message alerting him his wife had left @entity3 , even though they were traveling out of the country together			1
what surprised and disturbed them most , @entity14 told @entity25 , was the fact that the husband had not registered with the @entity28 to begin receiving such notifications			0
" it shows how women are still being treated as minors , " added @entity14			0
she went on to explain how , even though a notification system has actually been in place since 2010 , before last week , a male guardian would have had to specifically request the service from the country 's @entity28 before receiving such messages			1
in recent years , much has been made of the fact that @entity3 is the sole remaining country in which women still have not been given the right to drive			1
but restrictions experienced by @entity3 females extend to far more than just getting behind the wheel			2
in the deeply conservative kingdom , a woman is not allowed to go to school , get a job , or even travel outside the country without first obtaining the permission of her male " guardian , " or mahram			2
@entity53 causes dust - up in @entity55 in @entity3 , every woman has a male guardian -- traditionally her father , husband or brother			1
but the country 's guardianship system does n't just apply to women -- underage children , as well as foreign workers , also must be granted permission before being allowed outside the country 's borders			2
in the past few years , the country 's @entity28 has been introducing " e-government " initiatives to simplify tracking of dependents with technology and to make it easier for guardians to allow their dependents to leave the country			0
one such program was introduced in 2010 -- guardians could sign up for a service that would notify them electronically once any of their dependents , be they , wives , children or workers , had left the country			1
the information would be sent out once any of these dependents had their passports scanned and crossed any of the country 's borders			2
it was only over the course of the last week , however , that text messages started getting sent even to men who had n't signed up for this service			0
opinion : @entity93 needed for @entity95 pregnant workers @entity96 , a @entity3 writer and blogger , told @entity25 that the electronic monitoring controversy is a complicated issue that has been somewhat misunderstood -- that this is simply the latest iteration of an antiquated guardianship system @entity3 women have had to live with for far too long			1
" why is it being technologically implemented and being updated ? " asked @entity103			0
" why is it not being phased out ? that 's the real question			0
" and it 's a question that 's been asked more and more in the last several years by activists who say @entity3 's strict guardianship laws only serve to infantilize women and strip them of any freedoms			1
for @entity113 , the electronic monitoring is a serious matter , but one that has overshadowed something far more important : " this ( male guardianship ) system enables exploitation of women -- it 's government - sanctioned exploitation , " said @entity103 , adding how @entity3 laws enable men to exert complete control over their female dependents			1
" it 's a power that 's being used over women , " explained @entity103 , who strongly advocates ending the guardianship system			0
" women are not free			0
no matter how old you are , you 're always a minor			0
it 's almost like slavery			0
" @entity14 , for her part , wondered why there are n't e-government services in place in @entity3 to assist women who are in trouble , " to help women go file complaints against their abusers if their actual guardians wo n't go with them			2
" " women should use this to make some noise , " added @entity14 , " rock the boat , and say enough is enough			0

in @entity3 , every women of any age has a male " guardian "
the government set up an electronic monitoring program in 2010 for women 's travel *abroad*
the guardian could request to be notified if his dependent left the country
but now , men are being notified -- even if they never asked for the information
