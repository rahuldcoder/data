@entity0 -- president @entity2 has invited congressional leaders from both parties to join him in a meeting to discuss what to do in the waning days of the current @entity7 , vowing thursday that it will " not be just a photo - op. " " i want us to talk substantively about how to move the @entity12 people 's agenda forward , " @entity2 said			1
the meeting is set for november 18 , @entity2 said , following elections tuesday in which his @entity15 lost control of the @entity17 and saw its @entity19 majority reduced			1
current members of @entity7 keep their jobs until the end of the year in what 's known as the " lame - duck " session			2
@entity2 said he wants the meeting to discuss the future of the @entity28 - era tax cuts that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year			1
republicans and @entity15 disagree about how to extend them			0
the president calls for extending the lower tax rates for income up to $ 200,000 a year for individuals or $ 250,000 a year for families			0
income above those levels would be taxed at rates from the 1990s , before the tax cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003			1
most republicans oppose letting anyone 's tax rates go up , including the 2 percent of the population that earns income greater than the thresholds proposed by @entity2			2
" we have to act in order to assure that middle - class families do n't see a big tax spike because of how the @entity28 tax cuts have been structured , " @entity2 said			1
" it is very important that we extend those middle - class tax cuts			1
" the president said businesses also needed " certainty " about the future concerning tax rates			0
@entity40 argue that the income levels in @entity2 's proposal would hit too many small business owners and harm job creation			2
potential compromises under discussion would raise the income level for the tax cut extensions to $ 1 million , or temporarily extend all the tax cuts with time limits for higher income levels			1
@entity2 conceded wednesday that his party had taken a " shellacking " from the voters the day before , and the @entity40 leader in the @entity19 has signaled that he wants to roll back what @entity2 's administration and the @entity15 - controlled @entity7 have done instead of working with them to seek compromises on major issues			1
" for the past two years , @entity82 lawmakers chose to ignore the @entity12 people , so on tuesday the @entity12 people chose new lawmakers , " sen. @entity77 , @entity78 , said in a speech thursday to the @entity80			0
" the @entity86 has a choice : they can change course , or they can double down on a vision of government that the @entity12 people have roundly rejected , " @entity88 said			0
in response , @entity86 press secretary @entity94 said thursday that any consensus reached in talks between @entity2 the congressional @entity40 would not give everyone what they wanted			1
@entity94 also said he expected the november 18 meeting to be just the start of discussions , saying : " i anticipate that this is the first of many			0
" @entity2 used his brief statement after a @entity106 meeting to highlight his legislative priorities			0
he urged the upcoming lame - duck @entity7 to approve an arms control agreement with @entity109 , saying it is neither a @entity40 nor a @entity15 issue			1
the @entity19 must approve international treaties for them to take effect			2
" we have negotiated with the @entity109 significant reductions in our nuclear arms " in the new start treaty , @entity2 said			1
that has given the @entity12 leverage in seeking increased pressure against @entity122 's controversial nuclear program , @entity2 argued , because " people have seen that we are serious about taking our responsibilities when it comes to non-proliferation			0
" @entity2 is also planning to meet newly elected governors from both parties , he said			2
he 's invited them to the @entity86 on december 2			0
the meeting will be a " terrific opportunity to hear from them ... about what they 're seeing , what ideas they think @entity0 needs to be paying attention to , " @entity2 said			0
" they 've got very practical problems that they 've got to solve , " he said , praising their " common - sense approach that the @entity12 people are looking for right now			0
" @entity1 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this story .			0
