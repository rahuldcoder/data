-- @entity2 , we are told , is not like @entity3			1
the factors that coalesced to allow for international intervention in the latter do not apply in the former			0
there are clear differences -- in geography , topography , the role of neighboring states , the existence of liberated territory and the posture of the @entity17 -- that mitigate against external intervention			0
the problem with this narrative is that it ignores the most salient factor that should guide our thinking and the international community 's response to events in @entity2 today			2
that 's the ongoing crimes against humanity visited upon the people of @entity2 by the @entity32 regime and the human rights catastrophe that is unfolding before our eyes			1
while many governments repress their populations and respond with violence to public demands for change , what distinguishes the @entity2 case is that all the leading human rights organizations -- @entity44 , @entity45 and the @entity46 -- have unanimously characterized the policies of the @entity2 regime as " crimes against humanity			1
" this means the mafia state the @entity32 family has been running for 42 years belongs in the same moral category as @entity55 's @entity54 and @entity58 's @entity57 generals			2
speaking last week in @entity61 , @entity60 @entity59 affirmed that the " nature and scale of abuses committed by @entity2 forces indicate that crimes against humanity are likely to have been committed since march 2011			1
independent , credible and corroborated accounts indicate that these abuses have taken place as part of a widespread and systematic attack on civilians			0
" furthermore , the breadth and patterns of attacks by military and security forces on civilians and the widespread destruction of homes , hospitals , schools and other civilian infrastructure indicate approval or complicity of the authorities at the highest level			0
" the merciless brutality of the @entity2 regime comes as no surprise			1
a comparison of the human rights records of member states of the @entity91 places @entity2 at the extreme end of a spectrum of repression			1
arguably , only @entity96 's @entity95 was worse			0
while the 1982 massacre in @entity98 is frequently mentioned to highlight the viciousness of the @entity32 regime , less well - known are the horrors of @entity2 's prison system			1
tens of thousands have passed through its doors			0
@entity108 numbers never made it out			0
a @entity45 report on the notorious @entity112 prison describes " deaths under torture " and " summary executions on a massive scale			2
" one former inmate described the place as a " kingdom of death and madness " and emaciated prisoners were compared to " survivors of @entity125 concentration camps			0
" but this was just one jail in a veritable archipelago			0
one day the full story of @entity2 's prison system and internal human rights nightmare under the @entity132 will be told			1
when the truth emerges , it might rival the horrors chronicled in @entity137 's " @entity136			0
" in thinking about how to respond to events in @entity2 today , the colossal scale of human suffering -- past and present -- should be foremost in our minds			1
any discussion of external intervention should be guided by what the @entity2 people actually want from the outside world			1
this requires listening to the @entity2 democratic opposition			2
the opposition is divided on the issue of foreign military intervention , a chasm that is diminishing daily as the atrocities increase			0
until there is a broad consensus , the following nonmilitary steps can be pursued immediately			2
they would be a huge boon of support for the opposition and would be endorsed by all @entity2 democrats : -- officially recognize the @entity163 as the legitimate representative of the @entity2 people			1
-- establish a special @entity165 along the lines of @entity167			0
-- refer the senior leadership of the @entity32 regime to the @entity170			1
-- provide humanitarian air drops of food and medicine to besieged communities			0
-- keep the global spotlight on the @entity32 regime and its atrocities			1
there is a historic struggle for democracy under way in @entity2 today			2
it represents the aspirations of a people to free themselves from the tyranny of one the most brutal regimes the developing world has ever seen			2
claims that the conflict has now turned violent ignore the overarching reality that for most of the past 11 months the protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful , and notwithstanding the emergence of the @entity195 , most of the protests continue to be nonviolent today			0
what is truly amazing about the spread of the @entity198 to @entity2 is not that some people have taken up arms in the face of a brutal crackdown but that is it did n't happen sooner , given @entity32 's crimes against humanity and that violent tactics have n't been adopted by more people			1
the very fact that an indigenous internal struggle for democracy could emerge in one of the worst police states in the @entity91 world and be sustained for so long is both mind - boggling and inspiring			0
the heroic struggle in @entity2 today represents the best of the human spirit			1
it is fundamentally about the most basic political value we take for granted in the @entity222 , the right of a people to self - determination			1
it deserves our full support			0

he says the brutality of @entity32 regime has gone on for decades , aided by torture

@entity234 : in @entity2 , the colossal scale of human suffering should be foremost in our minds
