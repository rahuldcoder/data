@entity0 -- it sounded like a good deal : get a @entity5 birth certificate and stay in the @entity6 , worry - free			1
but federal authorities say the birth certificates were n't legitimate , and the undocumented immigrants trying to get them were n't @entity5			1
now a federal judge in @entity11 has sentenced several people for conspiring to commit immigration fraud			2
the defendants , authorities say , made more than half a million dollars selling forged @entity5 birth certificates to undocumented immigrants and helping them fill out fraudulent @entity6 immigration forms			1
their aim , investigators said , was to exploit a @entity6 law that allows @entity5 immigrants to apply for permanent residence if they 've been in the @entity6 for more than a year			1
authorities arrested @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 last year			2
court documents show that all four have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit immigration fraud			2
new immigration rules help undocumented families court documents provide details about a type of scam that 's becoming increasingly common , immigration lawyers say			1
in one conversation with a confidential informant recorded by investigators , @entity38 demanded thousands of dollars in payment for @entity5 birth certificates and provided advice about how to answer questions from immigration authorities who might ask why he has a @entity49 accent			1
" ' uh , because i work with a lot of @entity49 and i caught it ( the accent ) ... ' " period , " @entity38 said , according to a transcript of the conversation filed in federal court			2
" you are @entity5 ... from today on ... 3:25 in the afternoon you are entering the @entity6 and you are @entity5			1
" @entity38 advised the informant and an undercover officer not to make conversation with officials , and to tell them they arrived " in a raft , " according to the transcript			2
investigators describe @entity38 as the scheme 's ringleader , accusing him of recruiting the others and paying them referral fees for each undocumented immigrant who purchased his services			1
opinion : solve immigration without a quick path to citizenship he " met with numerous illegal aliens and told them that he could assist them in obtaining their residency in the @entity6 by pretending to be @entity5 , " according to a court document filed along with @entity38 's guilty plea agreement last year			1
" to effectuate the fraud , @entity38 posed as an immigration officer to impress the illegal aliens ( and ) also threatened some of the illegal aliens with deportation , " the document said			0
the day authorities arrested him , they found blank @entity5 birth certificates and altered naturalization certificates in his @entity11 home , federal prosecutors said in a memo filed this month			1
in addition to selling fake @entity5 birth certificates , @entity38 also sold fraudulent presidential pardons , prosecutors said			1
@entity38 , of @entity97 , @entity11 , is scheduled to be sentenced later this month			0
prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence him to more than three years in prison			2
" the full extent of @entity38 's fraud remains unknown as his former customers continue to be identified by the government , " prosecutors said			1
" the one conclusion that must be drawn from all the facts is that @entity38 devoted his life , over a period of more than three and a half years , to extracting as much money as possible from his customers and obtaining that money by whatever means necessary			0
" @entity6 district judge @entity114 sentenced @entity115 earlier this month to six months in prison , two years on parole and nine months under house arrest			1
@entity119 was sentenced thursday to four months in prison , two years of parole and 11 months under house arrest			0
and @entity123 was sentenced to a year in prison , three years on parole and nine months under house arrest			0
@entity38 pleaded guilty " and acknowledged he was the organizer , " said @entity128 , an attorney representing @entity38			0
that means he 'll likely receive a higher sentence , @entity128 said			0
attorney @entity131 , who represents @entity119 , declined to comment but referred to a memo he filed in court earlier this month , arguing for a lower sentence			0
the memo argues that @entity119 , 61 , paid @entity38 thousands of dollars for a fraudulent presidential pardon for her son , who had been convicted of a federal drug offense			0
she became involved in the conspiracy " through her efforts to help her son " and her criminal conduct was an " extreme aberration , " @entity131 wrote			0
" her background is one of hard work , dedication to her family and , until this episode , law - abiding , " the memo said			2
attorneys for @entity115 and @entity123 did not respond to requests for comment			0
this type of scam has been happening in @entity11 for years but appears to be on the rise , immigration attorney @entity158 said			0
there are consequences beyond this particular case , according to @entity165 , an immigration attorney in @entity0			0
more and more , she said , authorities are asking her @entity5 clients to prove the validity of their birth certificates -- something , she says , that suggests that this type of fraud is on investigators ' radar			1
@entity178 wrote the story in @entity180 .			0

prosecutors : scammers made *$* *500,000* selling fake @entity5 birth certificates
the scheme aimed to use a @entity6 law that allows @entity5 to apply for residency
" you are @entity5 from today on , " the plot 's alleged ringleader tells one client
