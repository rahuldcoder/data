@entity0 , @entity1 -- their stories were chilling : students at a reform school recounted beatings and sexual assaults at the hands of school administrators and other employees who were supposed to be taking care of them			1
but a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity1			1
results of the investigation , which was conducted by the @entity22 at the request of gov. @entity24 , were released thursday			2
the @entity22 investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago			1
read the @entity22 's final report state attorney @entity30 told the @entity22 he would not pursue any prosecutions in a letter dated february 25			1
" the primary obstacles to bringing criminal cases based on events alleged to have occurred more than 40 years ago are the constitutional rights to a speedy trial and to due process , " @entity30 wrote			1
" @entity1 's statute placing time limitations on prosecutions must also be considered			2
in a nutshell , citizens are protected from being prosecuted for crimes that occurred so long ago that preparing a defense would be difficult or impossible			1
the claims provided here are an example , " he said			0
the allegations against school workers were made by a group of men -- now in their 60s -- who call themselves " the white house boys " after a nondescript white concrete building on the school grounds where they say the beatings and torture were carried out , often with a thick leather strap			1
one member of the group , @entity65 , told @entity2 the outcome of the investigation shows " @entity1 is running with a scam and everybody 's behind it			0
" " @entity22 is whitewashing this thing like you would n't believe , " said @entity65 , who was interviewed by the @entity22 in the investigation			0
@entity65 said he was sent to the school for stealing cars , and went to the " white house " 11 times during his 30 months there , where he suffered unimaginable beatings			1
he remembers them as if they happened yesterday , he said			0
@entity65 said he was forced to lie face - down on a blood - soaked pillow that had small pieces of lip , tongue and skin from the previous boy 's beating			0
he 'd clench the metal bar of the bed as the strap struck him			0
" after that tick , you 'd go ' @entity94 , ' and then you 'd grab that bar , and go ' @entity96 , ' and the spindles of the bed would bounce , and sometimes the bed would come off the ground , " @entity65 told @entity2			0
the @entity22 said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from @entity103 and more than 100 former students and their relatives			1
but the agency acknowledged that most staff members who could have provided information have died			0
the report said there were inconsistent accounts from the men about various incidents , and a forensics examination of the " white house " building found no evidence of any blood			1
most of the former students interviewed during the investigation agreed that a wooden paddle or leather strap was used for punishment , the report said , but there was disagreement about the number of spankings and the severity			1
" there was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring , " the report said			1
" with the passage of over 50 years , no tangible physical evidence was found to either support or refute the allegations of physical or sexual abuse , " it added			1
@entity30 cited another example in his letter , in which a former student said he had been sexually assaulted in a " rape room , " but then admitted he was not sure he had been raped			1
" @entity145 has blunted even the accuser 's memory			1
due process demands that the accused be informed of the charge he is to answer with specificity			0
these claims do not suffice , " @entity30 wrote			0
@entity24 also asked the agency to look into 32 unidentified graves on the school grounds			1
some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses , rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers			1
but the @entity22 investigation announced findings in 2009 that it had accounted for all the students			2
" enough information has been corroborated on who is buried there , " @entity168 , chief of investigations for the @entity22 , said in 2009			0
" we went and identified all of the individuals who perished while in custody			0
" @entity65 said he reacted to the beatings and other events he witnessed by burying the pain inside			0
he also said another boy 's terror has left him wrestling with his own best and worst instincts			0
he said he walked into the school 's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running			2
he wanted to save the boy , @entity65 said , and tried to talk himself into being brave			0
" i said , ' do it ! do it ! do it ! ' " he recalled , his eyes brimming with tears			0
" and then i thought to myself , ' if you do it , they 're gon na put you in there			0
you 're gon na be next			0
' and i walked away			0
" but the @entity22 report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence			2
" they have no evidence , they say , of any deaths ? " @entity65 said angrily			2
" when i told them i came out and saw this black boy in the dryer -- did i witness a death or a goddamn birthday party ? " about 300 of the former reform school students sued former school administrators			1
the lawsuit was recently dismissed			0
" we 're attempting to move forward with a claims bill in the @entity1 state legislature to try and achieve justice for our clients , " said @entity216 , one of the students ' attorneys			1
one of the men named in the original lawsuit is @entity225 , a former reform school administrator , who still lives near the school grounds in @entity19			1
@entity225 refused to cooperate with the @entity22 investigation , the agency 's report said , because his cooperation could result in a criminal prosecution			2
now in his 80s , @entity225 did give a videotaped deposition in the civil case last year			0
he said the boys at the school who misbehaved were " spanked			1
" " @entity238 was a boy beat in my presence , " he said			2
@entity225 's attorney did not respond to @entity2 's calls for comment			2
@entity65 says the @entity22 's report about what happened at the school is wrong , and he wants to do his own investigation			2
" we 're going to get some ground - penetrating radar , and we have guys who will go and find the bodies , " he said .			0
