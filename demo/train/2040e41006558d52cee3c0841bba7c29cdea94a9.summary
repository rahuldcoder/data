@entity0 is recovering from another hazardous health crisis -- a toxic chemical spilled into the @entity3 that poisoned the water supply for hundreds of thousands of residents			1
safety and health advocates are cautiously optimistic things will change following the leakage of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol from a storage tank belonging to a company called @entity13			1
but that appears doubtful based on past experiences			0
pregnant @entity0 women told to drink bottled water " @entity19 , " as it 's known , has a less than stellar record			1
this is the third major accident in just over five years			1
in 2008 , a @entity22 pesticide explosion killed two workers and injured eight others			0
two years later , three consecutive accidents at a @entity27 plant released a deadly nerve agent used in @entity29 , killing one worker			1
the @entity31 investigated and in both cases found that the companies cut critical corners to save money			0
in the @entity22 explosion , the report found multiple " deficiencies " and " critical omissions			0
" in the @entity27 accident , the @entity31 found " numerous safety deficiencies " and " incomplete investigations " of previous near accidents			1
but safety advocates say local and federal officials did little to beef up safety standards and protections			1
" any kind of real reform is not there , " @entity49 , spokeswoman for people concerned about @entity51 , said			0
" our lives are currently in the hands of chemical industry lobbyists			1
" after the most recent incident , the chemical industry said it would consider taking appropriate steps if they are needed			2
the chemical industry in @entity0 is a lot like the coal industry -- large and powerful			1
@entity65 tests at 2 @entity0			1
sites show acceptable chemical levels in water elected officials have been reluctant to take on industries that contribute millions of dollars to political campaigns and also employ tens of thousands of people in the state , which is dependent on these high - risk , high - reward industries			1
@entity77 , an associate professor of political science at @entity79 , said the latest incident raises the same debate that followed past chemical spills -- as well as questions about the erosion of mountains from mining and deadly accidents relating to coal , including the @entity90 explosion of 2010 , whicht killed 29 miners			1
" there 's always a tension between the economic benefits ... and the environmental issues , " he said			0
even @entity96 , who is lobbying for better safety measures for chemical tanks , is sympathetic			1
her father worked for the chemical companies and she acknowledged that it 's a dominant source of livelihood for @entity104			2
" it 's what the economy is dependent upon , " @entity96 said			0
the chemical industry employs more than 27,000 @entity104 and boasts that the average annual wage is $ 78,000			2
the coal industry , which is even more powerful in the state , employs 60,000 people			1
and both the coal and chemical industries fiercely fight additional oversight that they say is too costly			1
on the front page of the @entity119 's website , a banner blares : " let @entity120 hear from @entity121 today			0
@entity120 policies are hurting real people ! " referring to the @entity120			0
and just three days before the chemical spill , the @entity124 responded to proposed safety topics of discussion			1
while the organization said it would support some ideas , it said it is " concerned " that some options would " further complicate an overly complex regulatory system by creating requirements for assessing safer alternatives			0
" what is 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol ? in response to the most recent chemical accident , the chemical industry group said in a statement : " if careful examination suggests that new steps are needed , @entity124 will work with members of @entity145 to ensure any new rules are targeted and minimize unintended consequences			1
" @entity77 said elected officials are most concerned with " keeping the coal industry alive			2
" those tensions are apparent as elected officials are measured in their response , and it crosses party lines			2
in an interview on friday on @entity65 , sen. @entity155 , a @entity156 and a former governor , said he is " not going to cast guilt on anybody			0
" @entity155 said , however , that he would push for legislation that would require inspections of chemical tanks near water			2
in the @entity167 , @entity165 rep. @entity165 , who represents @entity19 and is running for @entity166 , has called for a congressional investigation			0
she said she supports a review by the @entity31			0
but both @entity155 and @entity165 have repeatedly made sure to separate the latest spill from the coal industry , even though the chemical involved is used in that industry			1
" we have the country we have today because of the coal that has been provided , a lot of it from @entity0 , that has given us the life that we have and the wars that we have won and everything that we have taken for granted , " @entity155 told @entity65			1
" the incident that happened with this spill is not related to my view of the @entity120 , of overreaching and not looking at economics and trying to reach a balance in the energy industries , " @entity165 told the @entity181			1
" i see this as a chemical issue , and so the coal issue is secondary			1
" fueling elected officials ' soft approach is a deep distrust of the federal government among @entity194 , who feel forgotten and insignificant to @entity195			0
" the sentiment of the people is probably related to the influence of coal , " @entity77 said , as coal runs successful campaigns against government intrusion			2
the federal government has also failed to protect @entity0 residents from deadly chemical and coal accidents			1
more investigations launched as 180,000 residents still without water in this instance , @entity210 , executive director of the @entity211 , said at least three federal laws , including the @entity214 and the @entity215 , should have provided oversight of the chemical tanks , but that the local @entity218 has n't been on the site since 1991			2
while federal laws are going unenforced , state and county laws are failing to fill in the gaps , she said			0
no local law exists that requires the inspection of above - ground chemical storage tanks			2
and at a second facility owned by @entity13 , inspectors have cited five violations , including for storage and containment			0
now both @entity155 and @entity165 have asked the @entity233 to explain why pregnant women are advised to drink bottled water when drinking restrictions are slowly being lifted for other residents			0
" we are deeply disappointed in the @entity233 for recommending a screening level before receiving all relevant studies and information , which has resulted in confusion , fear and mistrust among @entity247 residents , " they wrote in a letter to the @entity233			0
the state has not fared much better			0
the state admitted it has no response plan for a release of the chemical , the @entity181 reported			1
in the latest incident , seepage from the tank entered the soil , found its way to the @entity3 and then entered a water plant downstream			0
@entity96 said she can still vividly remember the oxygen liquid blast in 1978 , when she was 8 years old , that killed three people			2
in addition to the 2008 and 2010 chemical accidents , @entity96 said there have been many more smaller - scale ones			2
" i am concerned with all the tanks ; there are so many of them , " @entity96 said , saying they are too numerous to even know how many exist in @entity19			0
" you name the chemical and we 've got it			2
" she said she has lived through numerous shelter - in - place orders to protect against chemical accidents			0
more disturbingly , she said there have been accidents when people should have been ordered to stay indoors but were n't , because it 's up to the chemical company to admit and determine the hazard -- a system that allows for little accountability , @entity96 said			0
she is optimistic that things will change this time			1
" i think because so many more people were impacted , the response will be different , " @entity96 said			0
local @entity0 officials are signaling that more oversight is necessary and numerous local and federal investigations have been launched			1
but that deep - seated distrust of government could persist			0
with a trickle , not a flood , water restrictions are ending " a lot of people i 've talked to have said they will never drink their water again , " @entity294 said .			0

the @entity181 area has experienced 3 hazardous material incidents over 5 years
the chemical , coal industries are politically and economically powerful in @entity0
safety , health advocates cautiously optimistic response will be different this time
