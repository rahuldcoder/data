eccentric basketball star @entity1 's bizarre outburst about an @entity3 citizen jailed in @entity4 has drawn widespread criticism , including from the prisoner 's family			1
@entity1 is in @entity4 with other former @entity9 players for a basketball game against a local team that 's due to take place wednesday , the birthday of the country 's leader @entity14			1
@entity1 , 52 , who visited @entity4 three times previously in the past year , describes @entity14 as a beloved friend			1
during an exclusive interview from @entity19 on tuesday , he reacted angrily to a question from @entity21 of @entity23 's " @entity22 " about whether he was planning to ask @entity4 leaders about @entity25 , a @entity3 citizen who was sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp by @entity4 last year on charges he intended to topple the government			1
@entity1 suggested that @entity25 , a @entity30 whose health has deteriorated during his imprisonment , had done something wrong , but did not specify what			1
" do you understand what he did in this country ? " @entity1 asked @entity21			1
" no , no , no , you tell me , you tell me			0
why is he held captive here in this country , why ? " " i would love to speak on this , " @entity1 said , before abruptly switching topic to talk about how his fellow basketball players had left their families behind to come to @entity4 for the exhibition game			1
when celebrity meets brutality prisoner 's family ' appalled ' @entity25 's sister , @entity49 , told @entity50 360 that @entity1 's comments were shocking and outrageous			1
@entity25 , a married father of three , has suffered a series of health problems during his detention and has been transferred from the labor camp to a hospital			2
his mother , @entity57 , who visited in october , told @entity23 that her son was a devout @entity59 who had not understood the system in @entity4			1
@entity4 is officially an atheist state and has said religious activities were among @entity25 's offenses			1
@entity25 's mother tells of heartbreak @entity65 said tuesday she was upset because @entity1 did n't use his relationship with @entity14 to help gain her brother 's release from the hospital			1
" he was in a position to do some good and to help advocate for @entity25 , " she said			2
" he refused to do so			0
but then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against @entity25			2
he clearly does n't know anything about @entity25 , about his case			2
and so we were appalled by that			0
" she said her brother was in @entity4 legally working as a tour operator when he was arrested in november 2012			2
she said she hoped one of the former basketball players would take a chance to ask for amnesty for him			0
" this is n't some game			0
this is about a person 's life , " she said			0
@entity1 ' crossed a line ' @entity90 , a former @entity3 ambassador to the @entity91 , also criticized @entity1 's comments , telling @entity23 he was " disappointed " by the former @entity9 star 's performance			1
" i think @entity1 crossed a line this morning by implying that @entity25 might be guilty , by suggesting that there was a crime , " said @entity90 , who worked to secure the release of an @entity3 held in @entity4 in 1996			1
" there is no crime			0
@entity25 is an @entity3 detainee that 's been there a year in bad health , who deserves to come home			1
" @entity90 , a former @entity104 governor who has visited @entity4 multiple times , said @entity1 " drank a little bit too much of the kool - aid from the @entity4			1
" @entity1 's comments tuesday contrast with a request he made on @entity111 in may for @entity14 to " do me a solid and cut @entity25 loose			1
" @entity1 struck up a friendship with @entity14 last february , when he first traveled to @entity4 with a team of @entity114 for an exhibition game that was watched by @entity14 , who is a basketball fan			1
he has described his series of trips to @entity4 as a " basketball diplomacy " project			2
but @entity3 government officials have said that they have nothing to do with the visits and that attention should be focused on the brutality of @entity14 's regime			2
@entity127 spokesman @entity126 noted that @entity1 is on a private trip and that the @entity3 has called for @entity4 to release @entity25			1
" our views about @entity25 have not changed , " he said			2
" i did not see some of the comments that mr. @entity1 made , but i am not going to dignify that outburst with a response , " @entity126 added			1
" i am simply going to say that we remain gravely concerned about @entity25 's health and continue to urge the @entity4 authorities to grant his amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds			1
" bae from @entity4 prison : please help me ' i love my friend ' in the interview with @entity21 , @entity1 defended the visit to @entity4 , saying it was a " great idea for the world			1
" he became upset when pressed on whether he and the other players should have traveled there , given recent events in the secretive country			0
the trip takes place weeks after @entity4 announced the purge and execution of leader @entity14 's once - powerful uncle , @entity156			1
" i love my friend , " @entity1 said in a reference to @entity14			2
" this is my friend			0
" he praised his companions ' willingness to visit @entity4			2
" you know , you 've got 10 guys here , 10 guys here , that have left their families , they 've left their damn families , to help this country in a sports venture			0
that 's 10 guys , all these guys here , do anyone understand that ? " " we do , " responded @entity21			0
" and we appreciate that and we wish them well with cultural exchange			0
" " no , no , no , no , " @entity1 continued			2
" i do n't give a rat 's ass what the hell you think			0
i 'm saying to you , look at these guys here , look at them ... they dared to do one thing , they came here			0
" ready for ' the abuse ' after @entity1 's outburst , fellow player @entity185 tried to calm the discussion , but @entity1 carried on			1
" you 're the guy behind the mic right now , " he told @entity21			0
" we 're the guys here doing one thing			0
we have to go back to @entity3 and take the abuse			2
do you have to take the abuse ? well , we 're going to take it			0
" @entity1 predicted his efforts and those of his fellow athletes would eventually " open the door " to @entity4			1
@entity185 pointed out that the group comprised not only ex-players , but some 40 other people , including a number of other @entity3			2
@entity185 defended @entity1 , saying the players ' visit was about basketball , not politics			2
" we just hope the results are positive , and we think that they 'll be positive , " he said , noting that the @entity3 had interacted earlier in the day with their @entity4 counterparts , talking through an interpreter			1
@entity4 had invited the @entity3 players as a kind of " cultural exchange " and to " put smiles on people 's faces , " not to influence the country 's leaders , @entity185 said			1
" we are here because it 's about doing great will around the world , " he said			0
' we 're not ambassadors ' @entity185 outlined the charity projects he has been involved in worldwide through his sport , including visiting typhoon victims in @entity224			0
" we 're doing what we do , we play basketball and that 's what we love to do , " @entity185 said			0
" we did not know that it was going to take this type of a negative spin on what we were doing because we 're not politicians , we 're not ambassadors			0
we 're here to do what we 've been doing most of our lives			0
" @entity185 apologized for " the storm that has been created by our presence			0
" but , he added , " we 're not apologizing for doing what we do ... we 're connecting people to basketball and people to people			0
" he cautioned against " playing semantics " when discussing @entity1 's use of the word " friend " in describing his relationship with @entity14			0
" it 's an associate , " he said			0
" you met someone once , and it 's your friend ... you ca n't meet someone once or twice and take that enduring step			0
" @entity185 added that the players were interested only in using basketball as a bridge to cultural exchange			0
" none of these guys are here to talk any sense into any politician , " he said			0
@entity263 , @entity1 's agent for 16 years , told @entity23 on sunday that @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity185 would play against the @entity4 senior national team			1
@entity9 unimpressed the @entity9 distanced itself tuesday from @entity1			1
" @entity1 will be @entity1 , but i think there is a lot at stake here in terms of a ... a very dangerous country , " outgoing @entity9 commissioner @entity276 said on @entity277 with @entity278			1
@entity276 , commissioner for nearly 30 years , said the league has had preliminary discussions in the past with @entity19 about a cultural exchange but he would n't send any players to @entity4 without the ok of the @entity127			1
@entity276 said he believed that these former players agreed to the game for a big payday and did n't think about the political ramifications			0
he said that the league did n't sanction the trip or collaborate with @entity1 's group			2
" sports diplomacy is a wonderful thing , " he said , mentioning that the @entity9 has hosted teams from @entity294 and @entity295			0
" but they should be done in a far more dignified fashion than this particular trip is being carried out			0
" @entity1 , @entity9 old - timers arrive in @entity4 @entity4 : reality vs. the world according to @entity1			1
