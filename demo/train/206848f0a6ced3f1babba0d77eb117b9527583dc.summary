-- though they had perhaps crossed paths several times on campus , it was only when @entity6 was scrolling through images of cute girls online that the one with brunette hair standing in some @entity11 country caught his eye			2
he opened her profile and saw her name was @entity16			0
she was 26 and studying to be a nurse			0
better yet , she lived only a few blocks away			0
with nothing to lose , @entity6 wrote a funny message proclaiming his love for nurses and hit send			0
one walk of four hours with @entity6 's dog , @entity28 , around campus and a date at the library ( that did n't really involve studying ) later , the two @entity24 graduate students applied for a marriage license in @entity33 just 10 days after meeting in person			1
why so soon ? " i think when you know , you know , " @entity16 said			0
while they could have passed each other walking to class , it took @entity41 -- an online dating website exclusively for college students -- to bring them together and officially exchange vows on april 29			1
with countless dating websites such as @entity47 , eharmony.com and okcupid.com , the online dating market is a bit crowded			1
but date my school has inched its way in and formed a niche for students searching for a boyfriend or girlfriend who shares the same educational goals and understands school comes first on the priority list			1
@entity61 , a grad student at @entity24 's @entity62 , has gone on dates to the opera , @entity65 and ice cream shops with guys she met on @entity51			1
" the guys place the same priority on education and the same passion for their careers as i do , " @entity61 said			0
" we 're also at similar places in our lives , being students , which makes it easier to relate			2
" @entity24 students @entity80 and @entity82 started the dating website on campus in november			1
this month , the site launched at 140 more schools nationwide , giving more college students the opportunity to meet their future husbands or wives			1
@entity93 and @entity82 , both recent graduates of the @entity92 , came up with the idea after a girlfriend complained that there was not enough testosterone in the @entity98			2
on the flip side , men in the @entity92 often wished for more women study buddies			0
if potential lovers were n't meeting in the classroom , the university needed a better platform for both sexes to interact			2
the solution : a dating website exclusively for college students			1
with more than 20,000 registered users , the site continues growing and has doubled its members in the past four months			1
some have compared it to @entity116 -- pointing out that the social network was also open to only college students when it began			1
but @entity93 insists @entity51 is not the next @entity116			1
" we expanded in a similar manner that they did initially , but then they opened it up for everybody in the world , " he said			0
" we will never do that			0
" only students or alumni with an active university e-mail account can register on the site			1
from there , users can narrow their searches to students attending specific schools			2
they can go one step further and select to meet only students with majors such as business , art or engineering			2
improving your looks online in its first few months , date my school was only offered to undergraduate and graduate students at 20 schools , including @entity24 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
the site took off at a rapid pace , as 1,300 students at @entity24 signed up in the first week			1
" i think we are responsible for more than half of the dates and meetings between students on campus , " @entity93 said			2
he added that the site is successful because it 's safe , and it works			2
" usually , people have a date within the same day they register , " @entity93 said			2
" if you go to any other dating site , you have to have conversations with other people for weeks before you can be sure it 's safe , that ( the person ) is not a freak			1
" with @entity51 , there 's an initial trust that stems from choosing dates who share common interests and live on campus or attend a nearby school			1
that 's the beauty of @entity51 , says @entity179 , an online dating expert and author of " @entity182			1
" " a student at @entity184 might want to meet someone to date at @entity186 , " she said			0
" now , it 's both technically and geographically possible for them to find love online			0
" college : hookups in , dating out the site fills a void for college students in the online dating world			1
according to @entity179 , about 25 % of match.com users are 30 years or younger , and there 's no guarantee they 're college grads			0
date @entity51 is the only dating site that specifies the user 's alma mater			1
" if somebody really has their heart on meeting somebody from @entity208 , this is a great way to narrow down the search , " @entity179 said			0
while date @entity51 's creators want to distance themselves from @entity116 , @entity179 credits it for lifting the stigma surrounding online dating			1
@entity179 , who tried online dating in 1994 before match.com and eharmony.com existed , explained that people now feel comfortable talking to others and forming relationships online			1
" if it was n't for @entity116 's popularity ... it would n't have allowed online dating to really become what i feel is now social dating , " she said			1
the @entity224 surveyed the number of online daters in 2006			0
results indicated that one in 10 internet users have tried online dating sites			1
online dating tips the number is much higher today , according to @entity93 , but people still avoid online dating because they 're embarrassed or believe dating sites are a waste of time			1
" they think that if they go to a bar , it is still more easy to get a date , " he said			0
but for students who are swamped with hours of studying and lab research , meeting someone at a bar or party is just not that simple when there 's no time to socialize			2
@entity251 , a second - year grad student at @entity24 's @entity252 with a hectic schedule , registered with match.com but stopped after guys she was not interested in contacted her			2
" there was one guy who looked like @entity258 , and i was like , ' oh no , this is not working for me , ' " she said			0
" nothing against @entity258 , but he 's not my type			0
" @entity251 said she 'd be more willing to give @entity262 a go , since she could narrow the search to a student also in an intense grad program who understands she does n't have to time to commit to a serious relationship			0
do n't be offended by online - dating rejection " a lot of people knock it , they just thinks it 's kind of cheesy , but you know what , it 's an option , " @entity6 said			2
before registering on date my school , the 33 - year - old wanted to be in a relationship but was just too busy to go out			0
" it was always just me , the dog and school , " @entity6 admitted			0
he says he has @entity262 to thank for meeting his wife and now helps his friends write profiles because his humorous tone is what attracted @entity16			0
@entity93 and @entity82 , 29 - year - old best friends who have made running @entity290 a full - time job , plan to continue expanding the site across the @entity293 and eventually @entity294 , where @entity82 is from			0
a recent $ 500,000 grant from investors and future business prospects are helping them turn their match - making service into a profitable venture			0
and with the thousands of datable women at their fingertips , you 'd expect the guys to be at the movies every night			0
but @entity93 said they have a strict policy that forbids dating anyone on their site			2
" of course , girls are writing to us all the time , but we try to resist , " he said .			0
