-- on @entity2 , @entity1 lay in a hospital bed and described to her doctor the feeling she 'd been having			1
her heart , she told him , felt like it was in a vise grip			2
@entity11 described the sensation -- which had come and gone for weeks after she had a baby girl -- like being " punched in the chest			1
" yet none of the tests performed on her heart indicated a problem			2
" the doctor turned to me and said , ' seems like she 's ok			2
i think it was just a panic attack , ' " said @entity22 , @entity23 ©			0
" he walked out of the room , was gone four or five minutes and i looked over and she had lost all color in her face			0
" " she says , ' it 's happening again			2
i 'm hurting , ' " @entity22 said			0
" i do n't remember anything after that , " @entity11 , 38 , said recently			1
her doctors suspect that @entity11 's history of high blood pressure caught up with her , causing the left hemisphere of her heart to buckle and tear , starving a large portion of her heart of blood			1
" that whole portion of the heart died , " said dr. @entity41 , an assistant professor of cardiac surgery at @entity43 , where @entity11 was transferred after her heart attack			1
" she was teetering on the edge			0
her heart was n't going to recover			2
" to try to restore blood flow , doctors performed a bypass			0
when that did not work , @entity11 was told she needed a transplant			1
more evidence links calcium supplements to heart attacks but because the wait for a matching donor heart could take months , maybe years , doctors offered a temporary solution : a heart pump to keep her alive in the interim			1
it was as @entity11 lay on the operating room table in april -- under anesthesia , ready to receive the pump , tubes and monitoring lines all in place -- that a miracle happened			1
" we 're prepping for surgery , which means in about 20 minutes i would have made a skin incision , " said @entity41 , one of @entity11 's surgeons			1
" my cell phone rings and it 's the transplant coordinator			1
a donor heart was identified			2
" the operating room staff was stunned			2
" i 've been doing this for about 10 years and this is very rare , a first for me , " @entity41 said			0
" and the timing of it			0
i could have gotten the call after making the incision , which would have made things much more difficult			0
" with @entity11 still under anesthesia , @entity41 went to @entity22 , her @entity86 © , to deliver the news			1
" i told him , the good news is we located a heart , " @entity41 said			2
but there was a catch : " we want to be really sure this heart wo n't be immediately rejected			2
" the odds favored rejection			0
@entity96 had just had baby @entity97 six months earlier , and antibodies still circulating in her blood would almost certainly attack the donor heart			1
but @entity22 said they had prayed for a heart , and he believed this would be a match			2
" i was very excited , holding my breath , " he said			0
he waited several hours while doctors cross-matched a blood sample from @entity11 with the new heart , to find out if implanting it would result in rejection			1
against the odds , tests indicated that @entity11 's body would accept the donor heart			1
later that evening , surgeons implanted the new heart into @entity11			1
" you know like when you 're a kid at @entity119 and could n't wait to see what was under the tree ? " said @entity22 about waiting for @entity11 to wake up so that he could deliver the good news			1
" it 's like that feeling times a thousand			0
" @entity22 was by her side as @entity11 's eyes tentatively blinked open two days after surgery			1
he delivered the news that instead of a pump , she had gotten a new heart			1
" she just looked at me for a minute			0
i said ' you hear me ? ' " said @entity22			0
" she looked at me again , her eyes got real big and she was moving her lips			0
she said , ' no i did n't			0
' i said , ' yes you did			0
' " " i did n't believe him at first , " said @entity11 , who then began reaching around to find the pump console			1
when she could not find it , " that 's when i realized i had a heart			1
" " she looked at me and started crying , " @entity22 said			0
@entity11 had spent a good portion of her daughter 's life in the hospital			1
the new heart , she said , means making up for lost time , getting to know her newborn			0
@entity22 said he owes a debt of gratitude to the organ donor for helping to keep his family intact			0
" they gave me and @entity97 a second chance with @entity96 , " said an emotional @entity22			0
" our little girl gets to grow up with her mama			0
it 's a miracle of life			0

@entity1 had *frequent* heart pains after her baby girl was born
a portion of @entity11 's heart had died , leaving her in *desperate* need for a transplant
while she was on the operating table to get a temporary pump , a new heart became available
