@entity0 -- ok , so @entity3 passed a bill , the president signed it into law and the government 's finally back in business			1
but with all the last - minute press conferencing , speechifying , and endless partisan tweeting , the one thing that was n't extensively discussed was the actual details of the bill			2
since it evolved constantly and was pushed through at the 11th hour , things got a tad confusing			0
here 's are the key points you need to know about the bill that saved the government : @entity22 can keep spending			1
through january 15 this goes down as a ' win ' for president @entity26 and the @entity27			1

9 things we missed during the shutdown " we fought the good fight , we just did n't win , " house speaker @entity36 said on a local radio station			0
now , there 's a little more time for both sides to hash out the bigger issues , like entitlement programs and tax reform			0
but @entity28 have been badly bruised and are n't going to want to walk away empty - handed again			0
so , it 's safe to expect them to regroup , get on the same page , and take a hard line the next time around			0
there 's a little pork in the bill we run out of cash again			1
on february 7 mark your calendars , because we get to have this fight all over again in a few months			1
february 7 is the new date the @entity56 will run out of ways to pay @entity22 's bills			1
this legislation raised the debt ceiling just enough to fund the government for the next few months			0
the two chambers of @entity3 will now have to create a spending plan for the 2014 fiscal year			2
if negotiations break down , we may be in for another round of last - minute debt ceiling shenanigans			0
but what are the odds of that happening , right ? show them the money			2
for healthcare subsidies this was a win for @entity28 , but they are n't exactly doing a group high five			2
conservatives had been pushing for insurance marketplaces to confirm the income of those requesting health care subsidies since the @entity82 scaled back the requirement months ago			1
it 's a pretty small bone to be thrown when you consider their starting point was an effort to totally defund @entity33			1
but hey , a ( small ) win 's a ( small ) win			0
furloughed workers will be getting back pay in an expected move , @entity3 agreed to pay back federal workers whose wages were withheld while the government was shut down			1
remember the @entity97 police officers , some of whom showed up to work out of a sense of duty and put their lives on the line when an erratic driver tore through the streets of @entity0 ? they 'll finally get paid			0
@entity106 , director of the @entity107 , said furloughed workers should expect to return to work thursday			2
of course , in the midst of battling to keep the @entity22 from defaulting , @entity3 took the time to load the 35 - page deal with some choice pork spending			2
but that 's another story			0
