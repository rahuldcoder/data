-- a @entity3 @entity2 militant movement on monday issued a statement claiming responsibility for a devastating trio of bombings that killed 74 people in @entity10 's capital			1
" we wage war against the 6,000 collaborators ; they have received their response , " the statement from @entity12 read in apparent reference to the @entity15 peacekeeping force in @entity3 that @entity10 contributes troops to			1
analyst @entity20 , from @entity22 - based think tank @entity21 , told @entity0 that if @entity12 did carry out the attacks there could be global implications as countries and businesses vie for opportunities across @entity29			1
why is @entity10 important ? @entity20 : historically it 's been important for the export of coffee and fish out of @entity34 , but now oil has been found , @entity10 could become a significant , if not major , oil exporter			1
so there 's much international interest , and not just western			0
the deal that 's been struck with @entity40 looks as if it 'll be farmed out to the @entity42 company @entity41 and the @entity44 state oil company @entity43			0
so these attacks in @entity10 could have global implications for business , be they @entity44 or @entity48			1
will they deter investors ? @entity20 : i think investors will do a stricter risk assessment and practice due diligence			0
they will look at where they think it 's safe for their workers to go and advise them to be careful when socializing at night , but i do n't think it will stop investment at all			0
does @entity10 have a history of violence ? @entity20 : @entity10 has had a low - intensity conflict linked to the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , of @entity67 , but this has been much subdued in recent years			1
there have been recent acts of random terrorism in @entity72 but nothing like that seen last night			0
( @entity76 humanitarian chief @entity75 has described the 20 - year conflict in northern @entity10 between government forces and the @entity66 as the most neglected humanitarian crisis in the world			1
@entity67 has said he wants to rule @entity10 according to the @entity81 but the @entity66 campaign has been marked by brutality , including the abduction of many school children with girls forced to be sex slaves and boys pressed into the guerrilla army			2
) @entity10 is on the @entity90 and is going to play a more global role as @entity92 and other countries want to impose sanctions on countries like @entity96 and @entity97			1
is @entity10 's international role the reason it 's been targeted ? @entity20 : @entity12 are the leading point of inquiry because of its previous threats against @entity10 and because of its contributions to the @entity104 ( @entity104 ) and the presence of the @entity107 training mission in @entity108			1
bomb belt found in @entity10 attacks probe i think @entity10 has been targeted for these bombings because of its activities in @entity3			1
@entity10 is on the @entity90 but it is going to step down at the end of this year			2
so that 's a transitory issue			0
@entity10 certainly sees itself as playing a regional role : president @entity117 was instrumental in pushing for @entity76 sanctions on @entity119 that came into force earlier this year so clearly he has many enemies as well as friends			2
what are the implications of the attacks ? @entity20 : if radical @entity2 group @entity12 is involved , this will be its first attack outside @entity3			1
if this is true the bombings will show it has the capability against soft targets outside @entity3			2
also it 's important to understand @entity3 is n't a monolithic , single state			2
there 's extreme violence in the south of the country but north of @entity108 and in an area called @entity140 it 's been pretty stable			0
in fact in @entity140 recently there 's been an election with what looks like the peaceful transition of the head of state of that area			0
so this is a complicated region for sure			0
is there any possibility of peace in @entity3 ? @entity20 : the @entity154 's policy is to support the transitional government in @entity108 but it only controls a few streets			2
the part of @entity3 around @entity108 and to the south is controlled by @entity12 , who do not recognize the transitional government and want to impose a strict @entity2 code			1
my own personal view is that rather than ignoring @entity12 we should be discussing with them what they want			0
and in that way it 's similar to the situation in @entity171 with the @entity172 ... the debate going there about whether one must engage with them rather than just fight them			0
the country remains very vulnerable and reliant on @entity15 peacekeeping forces and @entity104 , which is what @entity10 is part of , and i think that 's why @entity10 was attacked .			0
