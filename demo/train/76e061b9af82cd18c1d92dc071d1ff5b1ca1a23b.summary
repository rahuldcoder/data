@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 issued an ultimatum thursday to the manufacturer of @entity6 smart phones : allow access to highly encrypted information by august 31 or face a blockage of two popular messaging systems			1
the real - time messaging services have been under scrutiny because the encryptions make it impossible for intelligence agencies to monitor and , thus , @entity1 says , pose a potential national security threat			1
@entity1 wants law enforcement agencies to gain access to the @entity19 and the @entity20			1
" if a technical solution is not provided by 31st august , 2010 , the government will review the position and take steps to block these two services from the network , " a news release said			1
what hangs in the balance is the use of @entity6 for millions in a country with a booming wireless market			2
calls placed by @entity2 to @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , the @entity34 manufacturer of @entity6 , were not immediately returned			2
the @entity1 government has expressed grave security concerns over the use of highly encrypted services			1
some find it hard to believe that the world 's largest democracy is taking such a tough stance			0
but @entity1 also has deep security concerns as one of the most - attacked countries in the world			1
@entity1 was shaken after suspected @entity51 militants attacked @entity52 in november , 2008 , leaving more than 160 people dead			0
in that incident , the government eventually tapped into satellite phone conversations between the terrorists and their handlers , but the attack was already under way			0
@entity61 , a retired @entity1 intelligence agent , said @entity1 would be completely blindsided if terrorists used @entity6 to plot an attack and the devices were inaccessible by the government			1
" so what do you do ? react after the fact ? " @entity61 asked			0
" if you react after the fact , the explosion has taken place or a terrorist act has taken place , 100 people , 150 people have died			0
" who is liable for that ? is @entity6 going to be liable because it was withholding information in a manner of speaking ? so is n't it better to share ? knowledge and information from all sources is necessary , there are no two ways about it			1
" the situation brings up an old debate brought on by new technologies -- the government 's right to know versus consumers ' rights to privacy and free flowing information			2
the decision will have huge ramifications in @entity1 , one of the fastest growing telecommunications markets in the world			0
more than 600 million @entity1 use cellular phones , according to the @entity101 ; 1 million of those are @entity6			1
so the loss for @entity36 is potentially huge in @entity1			0
if it loses some of the services it offers , it could have a harder time attracting customers			0
telecom operators in the country seem to be hedging their bets			0
they 're working up contingency plans , but not really expecting to lose @entity6 services , especially considering that @entity36 was able to make concessions and strike a deal with @entity117 to avoid a ban			2
the @entity119 has also threatened @entity36 with a shutdown of services if access to encrypted information is not granted			1
" we think it will all be worked out , " said @entity124 , chief executive officer of telecom giant @entity126 's @entity1 operations			2
@entity2 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
