" we are focusing on those countries as well in order to ensure that there is no safe haven for @entity11 as we continue to pressure them , continue to push them , and hopefully continue to make the effort to destroy them , not only in @entity38 but throughout the rest of the world			0
" @entity8 is not new territory for @entity11 , according to @entity1 's terrorism analyst @entity68			1

... " the fact that we 're seeing evidence of this already happening in both @entity50 and @entity8 suggests that , @entity80 , the drone program in the tribal areas of @entity38 has been effective , but , @entity83 , you know it 's pushing @entity11 into areas where they 'll build up larger operations			1
