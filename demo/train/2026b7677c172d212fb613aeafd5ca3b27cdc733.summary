-- what do @entity2 leaker @entity1 and a red panda at the @entity4 in @entity5 have in common ? absolutely nothing			1
except that both mysteriously vanished			2
and both were the subjects of high - profile searches -- at least for a little while , in the case of the panda			2
but a little while was all @entity15 needed to engage in a flurry of jokes , including the creation of several parody accounts for @entity20 , the red panda			1
there were a few , tenuous parallels			2
both are relatively young -- @entity20 is 1 , @entity1 is 30			1
and both have connections to @entity28 : red pandas are native to southwestern @entity28 while @entity1 recently traveled to @entity30 , off southeastern @entity28			1
ok , perhaps that last one is a bit of a stretch			2
but social media transcends all boundaries			0
@ @entity36 tweeted , " somewhere , @entity1 is stroking a @entity37 laughing at us all			1
" @ @entity40 posted , " since @entity28 wo n't hold on to @entity1 , we 're going to start releasing panda bears			1
" first reported missing at 8 a.m. monday , @entity20 was finally captured around 2:30 p.m. about a mile away from his enclosure , zoo officials posted to @entity43			1
the zoo had tweeted several facts about @entity20 , warning zoo visitors that he is still a wild animal and would bite if cornered or scared			1
the search began inside the zoo since red pandas are known to be territorial			2
for at least a few hours , @entity20 's whereabouts proved as intriguing to many as @entity1 's			1
@entity1 made news recently for releasing information about secret surveillance programs conducted by the @entity2			1
he initially fled to @entity30			0
@entity57 officials confirmed he had flown to @entity58 over the weekend			0
although @entity60 claims to know his exact location , no one else seems sure			0
his reserved seat aboard a plane to @entity64 was reportedly empty			0
the @entity65 has publicly announced it is seeking to extradite @entity1 on charges of espionage and theft of government property			1
no such announcement was made regarding @entity20			1
" @entity71 : @entity5 engages in another frantic search , " read the headline to the @entity74 post			0
" now @entity77 has a @entity79 ring , @entity1 and a red panda , " tweeted @ @entity76			2
@entity77 has been accused by the owner of the @entity82 of taking his @entity79 ring during a visit			0
although parody accounts have come under fire recently as being unnecessary and lacking humor , @ @entity88 was undeterred			0
" is there bamboo in @entity92 ? " it asked			0
its @entity15 bio also included being a fan of @entity96 journalist @entity95 , who broke the @entity1 story			1
@entity95 , presumably busy with other things , had not tweeted anything panda - related at the time of this writing			0
some tweets appeared to confuse red pandas with the black - and - white giant pandas , also called panda bears			0
red pandas look more like a cross between a raccoon and a small fox			0
both enjoy a good meal of bamboo , however			0
this is n't the first escaped zoo animal to inspire an attention - getting parody account			2
in 2011 @ @entity117 chronicled the seven - day imagined adventures of the escaped snake			0
that account amassed 187,533 followers and still tweets			0
in response to @entity20 's escape it on monday it posted , " i have an alibi ! " the @ @entity127 account thanked its fans on @entity15 and @entity43 for helping recover @entity20			1
no word if @ @entity130 will do the same when @entity1 is officially located .			2

@entity132 went missing from the @entity4
@entity15 *erupts* with jokes about the vanishing acts of @entity1 and @entity20
@entity20 is found about a mile from the zoo ; @entity1 is n't
