he said as recently as two weeks ago that he was considering a presidential run , telling @entity0 's @entity23 that he " probably ( has ) more experience than other people who are running or thinking about running			1
" instead the senator will seek a second term in the @entity17 , where he thinks he can " play the most constructive role			0

" son says @entity29 ' more than likely ' eyeing 2016 run with @entity29 considered a potential frontrunner , the rest of the @entity2 field is eagerly awaiting his decision			1
those perhaps most interested include sen. @entity53 of @entity34 , who was mentored by @entity29 , and other candidates who appeal to moderate @entity2 , like gov. @entity55 of @entity56			1
" i do n't know if i 'd be a good candidate or a bad one , " @entity29 said			1
" i kind of know how a @entity2 can win			0
" @entity58 on the verge of becoming a political phenomenon a renowned neurosurgeon who 's become popular in conservative circles , @entity58 is still climbing up the charts , according to a new @entity0 / @entity64			1
@entity58 came in second place behind @entity19 in the survey , which measure support for potential 2016 contenders			1
@entity58 rose to political fame after publicly chiding the direction the country was going during his remarks at the @entity73 in february 2013			0
president @entity74 was sitting just a few feet away			0
since then , he 's been likened to a rockstar among conservatives , and he 's become the only @entity79 - @entity78 @entity2 expressing interest in a 2016 presidential run			1

but he has a bumpy road ahead			0
@entity98 election law allows candidates to appear on a ballot only once at a time , making it difficult for @entity97 if he also runs for president â € ” a decision he told the @entity108 that he 's about " four to six months " away from making			1
his allies in the state @entity17 tried to help him by passing a bill that tweaks the law , but the measure stalled in the @entity115 - controlled @entity114			0
still , @entity97 has other options , including a possible court challenge or convincing the state @entity2 to change its nominating system in 2016 from a primary to a caucus			2
that way , his name would n't appear on a ballot			0
or , he could just not appear on the ballot at all and forego @entity98 's delegates			0
it 's unclear which direction he 'll take , but expect @entity115 to seize on @entity97 's attempt to run for two offices			1
" where i come from , people think if you ca n't make up your mind on which office you want to run for , then you ai n't fit to serve in either one , " @entity98 house speaker @entity131 told @entity0			1
@entity55 wins high praise from @entity137 's top @entity2 in a bizarre 2016 storyline , gov. @entity55 vetoed a popular bill that would have banned gestation crates that severely limit the mobility of pigs in @entity56			1
while his decision drew strong pushback from animal rights activists and other supporters , the veto kept @entity55 in high standing with gov. @entity149 of @entity137			2
the @entity137 is the nation 's top pork producer			0
@entity149 , who holds significant influence in @entity137 's first - in - the - nation presidential nominating contest , said monday that @entity55 's veto was a " good decision , " adding that he personally lobbied @entity55 to reject the bill			1
@entity55 said he vetoed the bill because it was a " solution in search of a problem " and a " political movement masquerading as substantive policy			0
" but his opponents say the decision was simply a political ploy with 2016 ambitions on his mind			0
democratic state sen. @entity166 , a strong backer of the bill , pledged that the state legislature would attempt to override the veto , according to @entity170			0
one can hardly write about 2016 without mentioning @entity19 and the latest earth - shattering news that his picture perfect hair is -- wait for it -- not always perfectly coiffed			2
the bombshell was revealed by his wife , @entity177 , on @entity178 during @entity179 weekend			0
disheveled or not , he 's still the most favored potential @entity2 contender , carrying 20 % support among @entity2 voters in @entity0 's latest poll , with other names getting 10 % or less			1
he may have said a thousand times in the past two years that he 's not running again , but until someone else emerges as a frontrunner , voters are poised to keep him as their top choice			0
what @entity19 learned running for president : debating is ' sweaty business ' oh , right			2
talking about the emerging field , former house speaker @entity191 , who ran for president in 2012 , did n't rule out the idea of another run			2
