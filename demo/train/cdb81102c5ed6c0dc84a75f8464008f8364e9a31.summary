-- earlier this month , @entity2 governor @entity1 , who is universally known by his nickname @entity1 , claimed victory in @entity6 's presidential election -- though official results have yet to come out			1
@entity1 is a transformative figure -- often referred to as @entity6 's @entity9			1
he 'll be @entity6 's first president from outside of @entity2 's traditional elite , and has already shaken up the routine of @entity6 politics by refusing to promise cabinet seats to other parties in exchange for their support in his election			1
if he is confirmed as the winner then he 'll have received a mandate from the people of @entity6 to deliver both greater and more inclusive economic growth by transforming the country 's unwieldy bureaucracy			0
his opponent , retired general @entity27 , has refused to concede			0
@entity27 has every right to wait for the official tally , due by july 22 , and to challenge the result in the @entity31 , which must rule on any challenges by august 24			0
but @entity1 's lead in the quick counts -- a representative sample of the initial tabulations conducted on polling day at 2,000 polling stations around @entity6 -- seems unassailable			1
barring any subterfuge in the counting or subversion of the judicial process , @entity1 will be sworn in as the seventh president of the @entity6 on october 20			2
lacking experience but while @entity1 's rise could transform @entity6 politics , his agenda when it comes to foreign affairs is much more modest			1
as a former furniture exporter , he has no prior experience in foreign or security affairs			0
perhaps because of that , he has promised to continue many of the policies of incumbent president @entity55 , who came into office with far more experience as an army general educated in the @entity60			0
in @entity55 's first term , @entity6 cemented its position in the @entity63 and led important climate change negotiations in @entity65			0
in his second term , it chaired two important regional meetings , the @entity68 and the @entity69 , at a time of increased friction between @entity72 and @entity74 states			0
yet despite @entity6 's de facto role as a leader of the @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , @entity55 left much of the heavy lifting to his talented foreign ministers , @entity80 and @entity81			2
look for @entity1 to do the same by appointing a @entity83 © @entity82 to the post			0
one area where we may see greater emphasis under the @entity1 administration is @entity6 advocacy of global @entity91 causes			2
during a presidential debate on foreign policy in june , @entity1 announced that he would seek to establish an @entity6 embassy in " @entity96 - controlled territory , " and seek greater recognition for its government abroad			1
smear campaign @entity1 made this promise against the backdrop of an alleged smear campaign against him by shadowy forces connected to his opponent that portrayed him as a @entity105 of @entity72 descent , a description unlikely to help a bid to become the head of state in the world 's most populous muslim - majority nation			0
for the same reason , @entity1 spent the three - day quiet period between the end of the campaign and voting on election day on a pilgrimage to @entity119 , which the @entity6 press covered extensively			2
no one should interpret @entity1 's interest in @entity96 statehood as an indication that @entity6 will aggressively push @entity91 causes , or that @entity1 will make the kind of perorations on these issues that made former @entity130 prime minister @entity129 infamous in the @entity131			1
@entity6 has always quietly advocated for the @entity96 cause			0
establishing an embassy would take that advocacy to a new level , and is in line with a broader global trend toward acceptance of @entity96 statehood before a peace agreement can be concluded with @entity140			2
@entity1 's interest in the @entity142 could prove useful , however , to confronting a growing security challenge as @entity6 jihadists return from fighting in @entity145 and @entity146 , radicalized by their experience and interested in continuing the fight back home			1
@entity6 's foreign ministry estimates at least 50 @entity6 jihadists have gone to fight in @entity145 , leading many analysts to conclude the number is likely much higher			1
if @entity1 can use his greater exertions on behalf of the @entity96 cause to lobby @entity156 governments to help intercept @entity6 fighters returning to the archipelago , and to demonstrate that his government has not ignored the plight of their coreligionists in the @entity142 , he could diminish the risk of violence back home .			1

@entity1 has claimed victory in @entity6 's presidential vote -- though official results have still to come
would be @entity6 's first president from outside of @entity2 's traditional elite
@entity1 has expressed interest in @entity96 statehood during his foreign policy *discussions*
@entity178 : @entity142 interest could be useful in *stemming* flow of @entity6 jihadists there
