it was a rare show of bipartisanship -- president @entity2 , flanked by @entity3 and @entity4 in april , signing into law a bill that would ban insider trading on @entity8			1
the measure , known as the @entity10 , had passed the @entity11 and @entity12 at warp speed			1
" the powerful should n't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else , " the president said at the time			0
lawmakers proclaimed that the bill , officially called the @entity10 , would restore trust in government			1
it also applied new rules to some employees of the executive branch			0
@entity27 : $ 250k spent on one - day event but @entity29 uncovered that the law that members of @entity32 thought they voted for earlier this year is n't exactly as advertised			1
a loophole could still allow family members of some lawmakers to profit from inside information			0
the stock act requires that any trades of $ 1,000 or more made on or after july 3 have to be reported to the @entity11 and @entity12 within 45 days			0
but the @entity11 and @entity12 have two completely different interpretations of that rule			0
in the @entity12 , the @entity41 released one page of guidelines last month ruling that members and their spouses and dependent children all have to file reports after they make stock or securities trades			1
its 14 - page memo notifies @entity11 members and aides covered by the law that their spouses and children are n't covered			1
the @entity56 , which oversees all federal executive branch employees , sided with the @entity11 , informing its employees that their spouses and children do n't need to file these periodic reports			1
both of the lead sponsors of the @entity12 bill did n't realize the discrepancy until @entity29 brought it to their attention			2
@entity67 @entity4 @entity66 , the only @entity4 senator to attend the @entity11 signing ceremony , said he was " obviously very concerned			0
" " say i find out some information , i tell my wife and she goes and trades on it , what 's the difference ? " @entity66 told @entity29			0
@entity66 , who speaks constantly about this bill in his neck - and - neck race for re-election against consumer advocate @entity78 , said the whole point of passing the law was to demonstrate that members of @entity32 were n't held to a different standard			1
" i mean , bottom line , we 're supposed to have that level of transparency and have us be treated like every other member of the @entity89 and bottom line , if we ca n't do it , then -- sorry , if they ca n't do it -- then we should n't be able to do it as well			0
" why wo n't @entity95 release more tax documents ? sen. @entity97 , d - @entity98 , also criticized the @entity11 decision not to include congressional spouses and children			1
" i think it 's wrong , and i think it 's unfortunate because the reality is the whole point of this legislation is we should play by the exact same rules as every other @entity89 citizen , and when all of @entity89 looks at @entity112 , they know it 's broken			2
" " we 're trying to restore just a small measure of confidence through this kind of transparency and accountability , " @entity97 said			0
after @entity29 told @entity66 about the @entity11 interpretation , @entity66 fired off a letter to his @entity4 colleagues in the @entity11 , speaker @entity121 and @entity11 majority leader @entity122			1
" the @entity11 interpretation leaves a loophole and the appearance of an ongoing double standard , " @entity66 said in the letter			2
" it is deeply troubling that the @entity131 and @entity132 would attempt to operate under a substantially weaker interpretation than the @entity12 , " he added , demanding that the @entity11 adopt the @entity12 's view and require all spouses and dependents to begin reporting stock trades			1
chances for an @entity136 comeback why the difference ? @entity138 , a @entity112 ethics attorney and former chief counsel for both the @entity11 and @entity140 , explained that the @entity12 bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children , but when @entity122 's office wrote the @entity11 version , this language was shifted to a different section of the bill			1
the change meant that spouses and dependent children were n't subject to the new reporting requirements			2
" @entity131 recrafted some of the provisions of it and moved some of the provisions around			0
in that process , some of the @entity12 bill that applied to filing of these new reports was moved from one section of the bill to the other , " @entity138 said			0
the @entity164 decided to stick with the spirit of the law that senators originally intended , but the @entity41 went with the letter of the law , which included the loophole not requiring spouses and children to report financial transactions in a timely fashion			2
@entity4 senators block @entity2 job initiative why does it matter ? this so - called " loophole " goes to the heart of what the @entity10 set out to do			2
while there were already laws in place barring members of @entity32 or the executive branch from profiting from nonpublic information that they learn in the course of their duties , it was extremely difficult for those at the @entity192 to enforce those laws			2
the financial disclosure forms @entity11 members and senators were already required to file only come out once a year , making it tough to track any relationship between legislative action and a stock trade			2
that 's why the @entity10 added the rule that after each trade over $ 1,000 a report had to be filed in a timely manner			2
@entity138 stressed the new law provides " more immediacy , more real time so that the public could have more real - time understanding of what their members , of their senior staff and other high government officials were doing with their finances , what kinds of trades were they making			0
" the chairman of the @entity41 , rep. @entity220 , @entity221 , and the ranking @entity222 , @entity89 rep. @entity219 of @entity223 , defended their committee 's interpretation of the law in a written statement to @entity29			0
" as has been noted by outside experts , the office of @entity232 and various @entity11 offices of expertise , including the @entity235 and the office of general counsel , with whom the @entity41 consulted , the plain language of the @entity10 and the @entity230 is unambiguous and beyond dispute and the @entity41 interpreted it correctly			1
" @entity32 dysfunction : who 's to blame ? initially when contacted by @entity29 , @entity122 's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the @entity10			1
but when pressed with the new information uncovered by @entity29 , the majority leader 's office conceded it made changes to the @entity11 bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports			1
@entity122 's spokesman maintains the change was inadvertent , but told @entity29 because of our reporting , they 're now promising to remedy the problem			1
" it was not the intention of the @entity11 to differ with the @entity12 - passed bill with respect to application to spouses and dependent children			1
we did not believe at the time that we had differed from what the @entity12 had done , " spokesman @entity265 told @entity29			0
@entity265 said after learning from @entity29 about the difference , they are now looking at ways to fix it			0
" since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy , we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the @entity131			0
" still , another question is why the @entity11 changed the legislation in the first place			0
a @entity4 leadership source insists there were no sinister motives , that @entity122 and the broader @entity4 leadership made changes after consulting with @entity41 lawyers			0
how they will correct it remains to be seen , but the @entity4 source says however it 's done , it will be made clear spouses and children of @entity11 members and their top aides , as well as the executive branch all carry out the law the way @entity12 sponsors intended .			1
