-- @entity2 's obsession with finding his missing daughter began more than a decade ago , when the mother finally made good on a threat and fled with the daughter from @entity7 to @entity8 , according to him and authorities			1
@entity10 was a month away from turning age 5 , and the visit with her non-custodial mother , @entity13 , was supposed to last only a weekend in april 2002 , as part of a court agreement			1
but that weekend visitation in @entity17 lasted 12 years and finally ended tuesday , when @entity8 and @entity19 authorities said they found the girl and her mother living in seclusion in a small apartment in a town between @entity25 and @entity26			1
the mother will face charges in @entity29 , @entity7 , said @entity30 , an @entity31 assistant special agent in charge in @entity33 , @entity7			1
so much time has passed that @entity2 's daughter is all but grown , now 17 years old			1
moreover , his daughter has been told over the years that her father was " a bad guy " and " a wife beater " -- all false accusations , @entity2 declared			1
but @entity2 never gave up hope			0
he began a website dedicated to his daughter : @entity42 , which offered a $ 20,000 reward			2
he hired a private investigator			0
and he pressed his public campaign so relentlessly that people wondered whether he was going too far			0
" i was @entity47 and the white whale			1
i was not going to survive , " @entity2 said of his pursuit			2
" i 've had people say , " of course , she 's with her mother ; what 's the big deal ? ' " people just do n't understand , " he said			1
" i was accused of overstepping my bounds			0
" a confidential informant on wednesday , @entity2 was euphoric over his daughter 's recovery			1
he learned the news while at the dentist tuesday and had to rinse his mouth			0
the police action resulted in a minor injury to a federal @entity8 police officer who was involved in the arrest of @entity13 , 44 , according to @entity66 , a private investigator retained by @entity2			2
@entity13 was located in @entity8 through information from a confidential informant , @entity66 said			1
but @entity10 has been through so much emotional trauma that she is n't allowed to immediately see her father			2
she 's in solid physical health but has n't been in school for a while , her father said			1
she is now under the care of a clinical psychologist in @entity7			1
" i have n't gotten to see her yet , " @entity2 said wednesday			0
" she 's in pretty bad shape , from my understanding , " he said , becoming tearful			2
" she 's just not ready to see me and my family			2
i hope and pray that 's coming soon , and i ca n't predict it			2
" he described the 12 - year hunt for his daughter as a tormenting odyssey			2
" it 's a long road			2
you do n't know what the outcome is , " @entity2 said			0
" i told myself the hardest thing to learn was that i could have a life while looking for her			0
" when @entity10 is eventually allowed to reunite with her father , she will discover that she has a new family who has heard so much about her but has never met her : @entity2 's new wife and their children			1
" we hope to have her home as soon as possible , " @entity2 said			0
how his daughter was taken from him began on april 19 , 2002 , according to the website dedicated to his once - missing daughter			1
a weekend outing on that day , @entity13 allegedly violated a court - ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with her daughter during a scheduled weekend visit , the @entity31 said in its wanted bulletin for @entity13			1
@entity13 was supposed to return the daughter to her father two days later			1
he was the primary guardian , the @entity31 said			1
the father 's website does n't specify why the relationship between him and @entity13 did n't work out , but the site alleges that @entity13 has a mental illness			1
" @entity13 's court ordered psychological evaluation indicated that she has a well - established personality disorder , and that she is likely to act in her own interest , instead of @entity10 's , " the website charges			2
@entity13 and her attorney could n't be immediately reached for comment wednesday			0
on the day @entity13 was scheduled to return @entity10 , the mother failed to appear at the pickup site , the @entity31 said			1
@entity13 had moved from her residence in north @entity17 and left a false forwarding address , the father 's website said			1
@entity13 did n't even contact work when she disappeared with @entity10 , the webpage said			0
warrants and wanted posters later that month , a @entity7 warrant was issued for @entity132 , accusing her of interference with child custody , and then a federal warrant was issued in may 2002 , charging @entity13 with unlawful flight , authorities said			0
@entity13 even became wanted by the @entity31 , which published a public bulletin describing her as someone who " may walk with a mild limp " and " may have travelled to @entity8 , where she has ties			1
" on his website , @entity2 described her as a thin , petite woman who " typically does not keep a job for more than six months " and " may be likely to take a retail sales job			0
" @entity10 was listed on the @entity31 poster as every bit a little girl : 3 - foot - 6 and 35 pounds , with pierced ears , a mole on her right knee and a small scar on the bridge of her nose			1
see a copy of the @entity31 wanted poster ( @entity156 ) her father described her as a cheerful child who liked " barbies , bugs , dress - up , movies , @entity163 and @entity164			1
" " @entity10 has many friends and a large , loving family in @entity17			0
she is very dearly missed , " the father 's website says			1
the case briefly came to the attention of @entity0 in november 2002 , when host @entity171 of " @entity172 " appeared on the network			0
when @entity174 was told that @entity10 had been missing seven months , he said , " we have a chance of getting her back			0
she was taken by her ... mother , and that little girl we may be able to get back			1
but it 's by pictures ... that 's how we get missing children back , by exposure like this			2
" meanwhile , her father pressed authorities and media outlets about his missing daughter			1
he even posted photo galleries of him and his daughter on the website			0
" this is my school picture			0
my @entity193 says , ' what a big girl , ' " one photo caption says			0
" it 's my fourth birthday			0
who says i 'm not a princess ? " another says			0
trying to hide in @entity8 while his daughter and her mother lived in @entity8 , the girl went by " @entity203 , " the diminutive of @entity205 , one of the several aliases that @entity13 was using , according to the father 's website said			1
the @entity31 also alleged that @entity13 used many aliases			2
despite the use of @entity213 names , the father asserted that his daughter and her mother would not have blended in @entity8 society : @entity216 's @entity213 was " poor , " and their daughter " does not look at all @entity217 , " the father said on his website			1
in fact , @entity10 's middle name is fair			0
" it is unlikely that they could hide in a @entity217 community without standing out , " @entity2 said on his website			0
but @entity10 was repeatedly disguised , right down to her eyebrows and eyelashes , which were dyed , as was her hair , the website said			0
@entity10 's natural blonde hair was colored red and other hues on varying occasions , the father 's website said			2
as friendly and outgoing as the little girl was , the act of being spirited away imposed an emotional toll on her , the website charges			0
" it is reported that she is sometime ( s ) distant and burdened with the secrets she is being made to keep , " the website said			0
" it is reported that @entity10 has lost weight and is suffering physically and psychologically			0
" at one point , @entity13 apparently enrolled her daughter in the preschool @entity251 in @entity252 in @entity25 , and @entity10 reportedly learned how to speak @entity213 " very well " and to read and write the language , the father 's website said			1
a promising moment came for @entity2 when @entity10 and her mother were spotted in @entity25 , on june 13 , 2003			0
it would take 11 more years before authorities finally caught up to @entity10 and her mother			2
what now remains to be seen is how much of her father @entity10 remembers -- and how much of his great hunt for her she 'll come to fathom			0
@entity0 's @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0
