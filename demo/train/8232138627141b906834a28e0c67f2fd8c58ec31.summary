@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 created a website in his bedroom in rural northwestern @entity1 hoping to help people locate free movies online in a more efficient manner			1
from that small start in september 2009 , @entity9 ´ s site , @entity12 , has grown to one of the most popular entertainment sites in @entity15 , attracting 15 million unique monthly users , according to @entity3			1
" it was a hobby , a small thing			0
and it exploded in my hands , " @entity3 tells @entity2			1
but it has also attracted the attention of international media companies armed with lawsuits			1
the success has transformed the unassuming and unkempt 22 - year - old college dropout into something of a cult hero in the @entity29 - speaking world			0
it took weeks of negotiations to get @entity3 to agree to an interview with @entity2 , his first - ever with an international tv news organization			1
" @entity34 has a lot of complications now that were n't thought of in the beginning , like servers and traffic			0
we are now trying to solve them in steps , " @entity3 says			2
visitors to @entity34 can access thousands of titles -- the majority of them big - budget @entity47 productions with @entity29 subtitles -- entirely for free			2
according to @entity3 , @entity34 does n't host the titles itself -- it simply serves as a content clearinghouse			2
" it 's the same concept as @entity55			0
you have a lot of links and indexes , and the user searches for these , and you give them the links , " he says			0
" so really , the legal compromise is on the other sites , not on @entity34 , " @entity3 says			1
but many companies and artists disagree			0
in november , @entity67 and @entity68 - both , like @entity2 , part of @entity71 - took legal action against @entity34 in @entity1			1
@entity67 declined to provide @entity2 with details of its lawsuit against @entity34 , which alleged infringement of @entity67 's intellectual property rights			1
@entity1 asked a judge to block @entity34 from providing access to three of its original series , including the @entity83 - produced " @entity82			0
" the three shows are no longer on the site			0
" it is one of the first judicial decisions in @entity1 and @entity15 , so we are proud to defend the intellectual property laws , we are proud to defend our own productions , and we are proud to defend the assets of our company , " says @entity86 , director of legal affairs for @entity68			1
but it is not only deep - pocketed international studios taking @entity34 to task for providing free content without compensation			1
local @entity15 producers say they are feeling the pinch too			2
" the problem is that all regulations were skipped , and all the control was given directly to the @entity34 users			0
this is damaging to producers , directors , and the entire film industry here , " says @entity106 , president of the @entity107			0
yet , @entity34 is still going strong and gaining more users every day			0
@entity3 says many filmmakers are anxious to have their work available on the site , as it exposes them to a much - wider audience			1
" they end up making more , not less , money , " @entity3 says			2
for millions of @entity128 users , the choice between watching a movie for free in the safety of their own home and leaving the house to spend money on a dvd rental is an easy one			0
" i am not in favor of piracy , but i think sites like @entity34 should exist where you can access free movies			1
but the sites should pay the producers with money they get from advertisements , " says @entity140 , 38 , a @entity34 user in @entity0			0
@entity34 does make " thousands " of dollars in monthly advertising revenue , according to @entity3 , but all the money goes to maintaining the site			1
@entity34 has no employees , only volunteers , but @entity3 concedes that the website could one day make him very rich			1
" right now we are just working hard to improve and continue to be the number 1 option in @entity15 , " he says			2
the key concept that @entity3 and many of @entity34 's users are trying to promote is that major studios need to accept that the paradigm is changing			2
@entity3 points to the music industry as a cautionary tale , and says executives must realize that users will ultimately decide how content is consumed online , and how much they will pay for it			0
" the music industry had the opportunity to legalize all music , and by not doing so , it just grew and then you had like 10 @entity162 , " says @entity3			0
increasing access to technology , and overall lower salaries in the region have also contributed to the @entity15 mindset that content should be free , and it may be too late to change that , according to @entity3			1
" there has been a major change of mind -- and in @entity15 probably most of all -- because services like @entity55 , @entity173 and @entity174 are all free , and the user has started to expect those services for free , " @entity3 says			1
some companies are betting that @entity178 will start paying for movies and tv shows online			0
@entity181 entered the @entity15 market in september offering streaming content for about $ 9 dollars a month			2
like @entity181 , @entity3 says he wants to strike legitimate distribution deals , so that both @entity34 's users and the studios will be happy , but he says it needs to be done with @entity15 tastes in mind			1
" people in @entity15 are already complaining that @entity181 does n't have enough content specifically for them			2
until they do , i do n't think they will be successful , " @entity3 says			0
" @entity194 here just want to be treated as equals to @entity198 consumers			0
