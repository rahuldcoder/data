" in recent weeks , we have had a series of inhuman and despicable acts in different parts of the country that mark an irrational fight fundamentally between two existing criminal groups and their criminal allies , " @entity2 interior minister @entity8 said			1
there are " clear indications , " he said , that a recent surge in violent acts -- including the mutilated remains found sunday in @entity22 state -- stem from a " direct conflict " between the @entity24 and the @entity26 cartels over territory and power			1
@entity8 stressed that the @entity2 government would not retreat from its efforts to crack down on organized crime , which is facing increasing criticism as @entity2 's presidential campaign season heats up			1
