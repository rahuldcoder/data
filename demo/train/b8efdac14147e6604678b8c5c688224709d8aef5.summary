-- @entity1 plundered a hat - trick as @entity3 crushed 10 - man @entity5 4 - 0 on sunday to close the gap on @entity8 leaders @entity9 to just six points and with the @entity3 derby to come next week			1
@entity3 also have a game in hand meaning they could potentially draw level with the four - in - a - row champions if they were to win next weekend 's crunch clash			2
the hosts started in determined mood following @entity9 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity20 on saturday and @entity1 took an @entity22 cross on his chest on three minutes before sending a spectacular overhead bicycle kick just off target			1
but on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest			2
@entity30 dithered on the ball in his own box and @entity33 dispossessed him before trying to go round goalkeeper @entity34			0
there was minimal contact and @entity33 crumpled to the ground but the striker 's last touch had been too heavy and left him no chance of reaching the ball before a back - tracking defender			0
even so , the referee pointed to the spot and showed @entity34 a straight red card			0
substitute goalkeeper @entity47 's first task was to pick the ball out of his net			0
@entity5 battled on gamely , and on 26 minutes @entity50 escaped three defenders on the edge of the @entity3 box to bundle through before firing over on the stretch as @entity55 came across to put him under pressure			1
two minutes later the lead was doubled as @entity58 curled a cross into the near post and @entity33 hooked a brilliant volley over his shoulder and into the top corner			0
@entity1 proved a constant menace and had two early second half chances , flicking the ball over the bar with the first and being denied by @entity47 with the second			2
but 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a @entity73 corner			0
the @entity74 sealed his first @entity3 hat - trick with a rocket into the top corner from outside the area a minute from time			1
meanwhile , @entity79 slumped to their seventh defeat in 10 - games with a 1 - 0 reverse at @entity83 that is sure to increase the pressure on under - fire coach @entity85			1
@entity87 's stunning first - half strike proved to be the only goal of the game as @entity79 turned in a performance lacking energy and confidence which comes on the back of a 3 - 0 hammering at the hands of @entity3 in their last league outing			1
@entity79 dropped to fifth and out of the @entity98 places as both @entity99 and @entity100 overtook them			2
@entity99 moved up to third as on - loan @entity102 striker @entity101 scored his first goals for the club in a 3 - 0 win over @entity107			1
@entity108 opened the scoring on 17 minutes after a scramble at a corner and then @entity101 turned home @entity114 's cross on the stroke of half - time			0
and , on the hour mark , @entity114 turned provider again for @entity101 to head home his second			0
@entity100 could not fully capitalize as they were held 0 - 0 at home by @entity122 but still extended their unbeaten league run to 14 matches .			1

@entity74 @entity1 plundered a hat - trick as @entity3 crushed 10 - man @entity5 4 - 0 in @entity8
the result means @entity3 close the gap on @entity8 leaders and city rivals @entity9 to just six points
@entity79 continue to slide down the table after slumping to a 1 - 0 defeat at @entity83
