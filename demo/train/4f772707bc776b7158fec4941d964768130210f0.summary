two @entity2 hostages , one demand from @entity4 : hand over $ 200 million , or else			1
the else being that the pair will meet the same gruesome fate as other captives held by the terrorist group , others who were shown in @entity4 videos kneeling in orange jumpsuits in front of masked , black - clad men -- just like the @entity2 hostages identified as @entity14 and @entity15 -- shortly before being beheaded			1
in the latest video , a masked man gives the @entity2 government a choice to pay $ 200 million -- the same amount of money prime minister @entity22 recently pledged for those " contending " with @entity4 -- to free the @entity2 men			1
that deal holds for 72 hours , which would seem to mean sometime friday , since the video appeared on social media tuesday			2
another move that theoretically could change things would be if @entity2 's government halts its alliance with those fighting @entity4 , which calls itself the @entity34			1
@entity35 has n't participated in airstrikes aimed at the @entity38 extremist group , though its leaders have supported those who have , as well as the @entity42 government			0
" although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the @entity34 , you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade , " the masked man on the video posted tuesday says , addressing his comments to @entity22			1
but @entity22 , who is visiting the @entity49 , did n't seem about to bargain tuesday			0
he stood by a pledge , made in a speech at the weekend in @entity52 , for funding to help build " human capacities , infrastructure and so on " for those affected by @entity4 ' armed campaign			1
" the pledge aid is very important to the refugees in need and has nothing to do with the @entity64 communities or the radical militants , " the prime minister said			1
" ... we will contribute to the ( region 's ) peace and stability , in cooperation with the global community			2
" as to the @entity4 threat against two of his nation 's citizens , @entity22 called it " unacceptable			1
" " i feel angry about it , " he said			2
" i strongly urge them to immediately release the hostages without harming them			0
" @entity4 has asked for ransoms before , and apparently has been paid them			1
but rarely are such demands made publicly			0
even rarer -- unprecedented , in fact -- is when the militant group puts its captives on video and threatens them , then lets them go			0
instead , @entity4 has made a public show out of its threatening and killings of @entity90 hostages , starting with august 's beheading of @entity93 journalist @entity92			1
others ' killings were similarly recorded and posted online , including @entity93 journalist @entity96 , @entity98 aid worker @entity97 , @entity98 taxi driver @entity99 and @entity93 aid worker @entity100			0
while not participating in ground combat , both the @entity93 and @entity102 have taken an active role in the @entity105 fight with airstrikes and training , arming and otherwise supporting groups -- such as @entity42 's military , @entity111 fighters and moderate @entity113 opposition -- taking on the militants face - to - face			0
that 's not the case for @entity2 , whose @entity118 constitution allows it to use its military only for self - defense			1
but @entity35 is a strong ally with @entity90 powers , such as the @entity93 , that have been singled out by @entity4			1
in his remarks tuesday in @entity126 , @entity22 -- who dealt with another hostage crisis involving @entity64 militants in january 2013 , when 10 @entity2 citizens were caught up in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in @entity133 -- said he had ordered @entity2 officials to do the utmost to try to save the two men			1
at the same time , the prime minister added , " terrorists should not be forgiven , for any reason			1
i criticize ( the taking of hostages ) emphatically			0
" the aim is to safely bring home two men who were in the same war - torn region for very different reasons			0
like @entity92 and @entity96 , @entity147 went there to help tell the story of what was happening in @entity42 and @entity113			0
in recent months , @entity4 militants have managed to take over vast swaths of both countries , ruthlessly going after many in their way who do n't share their extremist interpretation of @entity64			2
the @entity4 video refers to him as " @entity14 , " but on his @entity159 handle -- and a photograph accredited to him -- he 's just called @entity147			1
the freelance journalist reported for various @entity2 news organizations about the situation in the northern @entity113 battleground city of @entity165 , which for weeks has been under siege by @entity4 , and other areas			1
while it 's not known when he was taken captive , @entity169 's last @entity159 post was on october 23			0
the man purportedly shown along with him , @entity171 , is believed to have been captured in @entity113 in august while traveling with rebel fighters , according to the @entity2 news agency @entity173			1
the 42 - year - old claimed to have set up a company in @entity35 providing armed security services and posted videos online of his activities in @entity42 and @entity113			0
but a report by the news agency @entity180 in august portrayed him as a lost soul , who went to the @entity49 searching for a purpose after losing his wife , his business and his home over the previous decade			0
@entity173 reported previously that @entity2 officials in @entity188 had being trying to secure his release , including talking to various groups with possible connections to his captors			2
@entity22 spoke firmly tuesday against the terrorists and their $ 200 million ransom demand			0
what he did not do , however , is rule out the @entity2 government paying ransom or negotiating with its two citizens ' captors			2
like most countries , @entity2 has never advertised that it or @entity2 companies have paid ransom for hostages			2
in fact , @entity2 government officials have at times denied such a practice , and @entity2 is a signatory to a 2013 @entity213 communique that stated , " we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists , and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out			2
" one reason for this policy is that @entity4 and groups like it can use ransoms to fund their bloody campaigns			2
paying ransoms also may give them incentive to take more hostages , thus putting more people at risk			0
and ransoms might not always work , since @entity4 and other hostage takers are n't usually seen as trustworthy			1
still , ruling out ransoms also rules out one peaceful way to free @entity147 and @entity171			0
it 's possible someone else may intervene to negotiate their release , whether out of goodwill or in exchange for something else			0
or troops from a @entity2 ally could launch a raid to get to them , like the unsuccessful one this summer to free @entity92			2
either way , others could play a role in this story before it 's done -- hence @entity22 's comment tuesday that the international community " needs to deal with terrorists without giving in to them			0
" @entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			0

a video shows a masked man standing over two kneeling men in orange jumpsuits
he links the threat against the men to @entity2 's support for the coalition against @entity4
@entity2 's prime minister says he 's angry about the " unacceptable " hostage situation
