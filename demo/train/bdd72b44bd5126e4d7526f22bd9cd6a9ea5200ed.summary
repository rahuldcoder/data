-- @entity0 is now available , and with it comes @entity3 , @entity5 's cloud - based music subscription service			1
for $ 25 a year , @entity3 drops any track you purchase from @entity0 directly into @entity5 's @entity8			1
songs are saved to the cloud automatically , so there 's no need to download the song from @entity14 separately on each of your @entity16			2
@entity3 also takes care of songs that were n't purchased from @entity14			2
the service scans all the songs in your library , and if it finds a match in the @entity27 , you do n't need to upload that song yourself -- instead it uses the @entity32 - free copy that @entity5 already has in @entity14			1
and if it does n't find a version of the song in your library , it 'll upload your version			0
@entity3 is limited to 25,000 songs , and can work with up to 10 different devices			1
@entity3 has been available exclusively for developers since late august , and was supposed to land by the end of october			0
to get @entity3 , just upgrade your @entity0 version to 10.5.1 , click the @entity42 link on the @entity27 page , and sign up using your @entity44 and your favorite credit card			2
depending on the size of your collection , the initial scanning and uploading process could take a few hours			0
registration availability is currently a bit spotty as users flock to download @entity42 , so you may get a message ( like in the screenshot above ) that tells you new @entity3 subscriptions are unavailable , and to check back in an hour or two			0
