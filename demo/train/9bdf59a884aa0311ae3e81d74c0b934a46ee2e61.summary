-- there 's a good chance you 've seen more of @entity4 in magazines or on tv recently			1
with its ice cap and glaciers melting at a rapid rate , the island is at the center of climate change conversation			1
the stories are troubling , but it 's not all bad news for the folks in @entity4			1
you see , the increased attention has helped @entity4			1
its tourism business is , by @entity4 standards , booming			1
" our tourism is still very small , " said @entity22 , a senior consultant at the @entity23			2
" but we 've seen quite an increase in cruise tourism and an incremental increase in land - based visitors			1
" @entity30 said @entity4 gets about 30,000 cruise visitors per year , a four-fold increase in the past decade			1
about 35,000 people fly in for visits			0
it 's a lot for a nation that 's bigger than @entity37 but with a population the size of @entity40 , @entity41			0
most visitors to the island still come from @entity44 ( @entity4 is a self - governing @entity44 territory )			1
but the second - largest group used to be @entity46 , la @entity22 said , and their numbers have been overtaken by people from @entity49			0
only a few come because they want to see the ice cap before it vanishes , they say			0
more than 80 % of the island is covered by it , and the ice is as thick as 14,000 feet in some places , according to the @entity57			2
" @entity4 has been a major concern because there is a lot of ice sitting on land , and it 's melting a lot faster than we thought it was going to , " said @entity59 , director of international climate policy for the @entity60			1
" it 's a big unknown in the system			0
" last year , the book " 100 places to go before they disappear " selected two sites in @entity4 for its list -- the town of @entity75 , to the west , and @entity79 , in the northeast , where there 's an ecosystem research center			1
the book noted that temperatures in @entity4 are substantially higher and said the water around @entity75 no longer has permanent ice cover			2
for the @entity4 tourism bureau , climate change is often a part of the discussion			1
they even devote a page to it on the greenland.com website , where they try to assure potential tourists that melting ice does n't mean there 's nothing to see			2
" while doubt still prevails as to the speed at which the volume of the ice is declining and the complex relationships between causes of temperature increases , " the site reads , " there is one thing that is certain : new ice will continue to be created on the ice sheet , and there will still be enormous amounts of ice to admire in @entity4 for the next many generations			2
it is just a question of how much			0
" @entity30 said that people who come to @entity4 can witness firsthand the results of climate change			1
" you can see how glaciers have been retreating			0
you can see the marks on the sides of the glacier where it used to be and where it is now , " he said			0
" actually being there and being a witness to what is happening to our environment , that has great appeal			0
" @entity59 , whose organization works with tourism boards to promote eco-friendly practices , said places affected by climate change need to plan ahead			1
" many local economies are so dependent on tourism , " she said			0
" forward - looking cities are starting to plan how do you diversify you economy and how do you develop other attractions			0
people can disagree about when the worst consequences of climate change will hit , but we know it 's already happening			1
" the effects of climate change have " put us on the map , " la @entity22 says			1
the challenge now is to convince more people that @entity4 is n't really that far a trip or such a forbidding land			2
but it 's not a destination for everyone , he admits			0
most of the top tourist trips revolve around the ice or wildlife , such as watching polar bears or whales			0
@entity166 , the author of " @entity166 , " calls @entity4 " the ultimate frontier			2
" the weather , while brutally cold in recent winters , can be surprisingly warm in the spring and summer , the top two tourist seasons , la @entity22 said			0
so when you pack your bags , do n't worry , you can even throw in a t - shirt			0
or if the warming trend continues , a few t - shirts .			0

@entity4 is getting more media attention as climate change affects the country
the attention has drawn more tourists to the island , including 30,000 cruise visitors per year
@entity4 tourism *officials* tell visitors there 's still ice to see , but it 's *unclear* how much will remain over time
