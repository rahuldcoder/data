-- women spend every day juggling bosses and birthday parties , dates and diapers , but when was the last time you had a day to do what you want to do , obligation - free ? how about four ? enter @entity10 , a retreat for women to , as they put it , " escape , unwind and reignite your flame ; to renew and re-energize , however you choose to do it			1
" translation : me time			2
it was founded by @entity19 , an @entity20 - winning tv producer , who calls camp her " happy place " and dreams of being a camp director full time			1
@entity25 offers a variety of activities for body , mind and spirit			1
" we go out of our way not to make it spiritual , " @entity19 says , " because there are so many retreats like that			2
it 's all there , but it happens naturally			2
we say it 's a life - changing weekend for some people , but what that is is different for everyone			1
some people do n't even know what they need when they get there			2
" that 's what we hear , ' i did n't even know how badly i needed it			2
' " the camps are held in @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 , @entity55 , with an upcoming session being planned in @entity57 next year			2
the four - day weekend costs $ 975 for all lodging , meals , snacks , alcohol and activities			1
let me get a few things out of the way : i did n't pay to attend			2
i was at camp as reporter invited by the organizer			1
although i loved summer camp as a kid , these days i 'm not what you 'd call a joiner			1
my emotions run deep , but i do n't typically share them with just anybody			1
and i fantasize about chucking my life and living like a hippie , but for now i enjoy both privacy and luxury of all varieties			2
my approach to the weekend was to think of it as a very cool work assignment , and the limited cell reception would give me an excuse not to check e-mail			2
i did n't expect to love it and i certainly did n't expect to be changed by it			2
but then the alchemy of being in nature with a group of amazing women kicks in			1
i met women who loved summer camp as a kid , and wanted to relive the days of youth ; moms who celebrated a milestone birthday away from the stress of daily life and others who just wanted a getaway			1
our days were filled with yoga and fitness , parenting and relationship workshops , life coaching , healthy cooking demonstrations , energy healing , journaling , astrology and palm reading , fashion and style advice , as well as sing - alongs , s'more roasting , a sex toy party and happy hour featuring vodka - soaked gummy worms			1
you 're participating in activities ( or not -- everything is optional ) that push you out of your comfort zone physically and emotionally , and supporting one another in the process			1
before i knew it , all of my defenses melted and gave way to deep bonding			2
in fact , i was so present that , with apologies to my editor , i kinda forgot i was there to write			2
" it was so nice to just be with other women and share our stories , " says @entity136 , 40 , a stay - at - home mother of two from of @entity138 , @entity139			1
" it made me a happier person			2
i felt renewed and like i am not alone			2
" " it was amazing to see strong friendships form after only three days , " says @entity146 , 45 , an entertainment marketing consultant from @entity148 , @entity53			2
" i was more open with sharing feelings than i thought i might be with complete strangers			0
" the idea for @entity25 started in 2001 when @entity19 's friend invited her over for wine and chocolate with four other women , none of whom knew anyone but the hostess			1
" apparently we were all bitching and moaning to her about the same things , " @entity19 recalls			0
" we were working too hard , we were not working out enough , we were all making more money than our men , we were giving our kids too much and not taking anything for ourselves , we were taking care of our aging parents , we were trying to figure out ' what 's this spiritual thing ? ' and if there 's really a god and everything happens for a reason , why the hell am i so miserable ? " because we did n't know each other , it was the theory of sitting next to the stranger on an airplane : we started to talk about things like guilt and relationships and sex and stuff that is normally off - limits in your world			1
it was a place to share common experiences ; to go and dump in a safe space			1
there was unconditional acceptance and no judgment at all			0
" the group 's meetings eventually grew longer , and their lives more intertwined			0
the gatherings were so therapeutic , the women decided to share their stories in the hope that it would have the same effect on others			1
they also organized retreats , originally dubbed @entity206			0
@entity19 refined the program over the years			0
the april @entity25 session i attended was the 19th camp she 's produced , and every camp lineup is different			1
at ours , a reading led by @entity214 , co-author of " @entity215 : the @entity223 for the @entity224 , " found a roomful of mothers laughing for an hour straight in both recognition and relief as they shared stories of their own so - called s -- tty parenting			1
one woman sometimes keeps her kids up past their bedtime so she can sleep late , one lies about dead batteries -- even on toys that do n't run on them -- when she does n't feel like dealing			0
another accidentally left her sleeping infant upstairs when she and her husband went to a movie for the first time after the baby was born			0
" it made me realize there are so many moms out there like me and we are n't s -- tty , but truly great moms who are n't perfect , " @entity146 says			0
" it was highly amusing and it felt good to laugh from the belly , " says @entity245 , 42 , a daycare business owner , from @entity138 , @entity139			0
the centerpiece of the @entity25 experience is the ropes course , which involves traversing an elevated balance beam and swinging off @entity252 - style when you reach the other side , or climbing a 35 - foot telephone poll and jumping off onto a trapeze , @entity257 the " leap of faith			1
" " i loved the ' leap of faith , ' " @entity136 says			1
" it was scary , emotional and invigorating			0
" " we 've got these hot coaches offering encouragement , " @entity19 says			0
" you do n't realize you 're about to be transformed because you just think , i just have to get across that beam or to the top of that pole			1
but when you get to the top , all of a sudden , you 're raw			0
you 're standing looking at the ocean			0
you 're so proud of yourself and ca n't believe you did it			0
" that 's when the coaches start asking you questions : what do you love about your life ? what do you want to leave behind ? what 's not working for you ? what are you afraid of ? " who thinks about that ? ! " @entity19 says			0
" now you 're standing on the top of the world with people on the ground cheering for you			0
there 's something magical that happens from the unconditional support you 're getting from people that 48 hours before you never even knew that bonds everybody instantly			0
everybody is so happy for each other			1
" before @entity10 , i was perfectly content for my thrills with poles to take place at sea level			0
see , i mistook the " leap of faith " for a physical adventure that i was n't particularly interested in , but would be mad at myself for skipping			1
instead , it was an unexpected confrontation with -- and then triumph over -- my limiting beliefs			0
my brain tried every excuse to keep me from reaching the top , all of which basically boiled down to : what if you try and you fail ? it 's a recurring negative thought that has prevented me from taking other risks in my life			0
through sheer force of will that this time be different , and the encouragement from the women below , i reached the top with a new outlook on life : the view is breathtaking , and you 're supported even if you fail			1
" i did the swing and it was fun and all , but the ladies who did the pole brought me to tears every time , " @entity318 says			1
" i felt like i was going through all their emotions with them -- with my feet firmly on the ground -- and fighting for them to overcome whatever challenge they were struggling through			0
" " the leap of faith was a game changer for me , " says @entity331 , a 40 - year - old mother of two			1
" i have never done anything like that before			0
it was a raw fear that i pushed through			0
i felt supported and found a courage that i did n't know existed			0
" of course , @entity19 did			0
" we did n't just pull the experts off the street , " she says			0
" i spent months building this team			0
they 're well - heeled in what they do , but more importantly , i 've been helped personally by them and i just want to share with people the stuff that 's helped me			1
" i 'm a 53 - year - old single mother , workaholic , camp - obsessed person , " she says			1
" i 'm every woman			0
i 'm 10 pounds overweight , i 'm struggling to juggle my life , i want more in the way of money , i want more love , i want to be able to share and have joy every day , i want to have children who contribute to the planet , i want more out of my life			1
" now , at least for one weekend at a time , we can .			0
