@entity0 , @entity1 -- twenty years on from the 100 days of the @entity1 genocide , and many here are still in search of closure			1
in april 1994 hundreds of thousands of @entity8 and moderate @entity9 were murdered by @entity9 militias			1
the @entity1 government has asked that this be a time of reflection and unity , through forgiveness and reconciliation			1
but for many @entity1 the reality of what it actually takes to forgive is one they struggle with every day			1
@entity23 @entity22 is 24 years old			2
his memories of his father , he says , have grown hazy with time			2
" the night he was killed i do n't really remember that since i ca n't even remember where i was , " says @entity22			2
" but after the genocide had ended , i started following up on stories that were informing me on how he died that night			1
" @entity22 's search for answers eventually brought him face - to - face with his father 's killers , and a day he says he feels he 's waited all his life for			1
his father 's killers have promised to help him find the body			1
" i never had a chance to bury my parent as his child in a decent way and i did n't how he was killed , did n't even know how he was buried			2
this became a burden in my heart , " @entity22 tells @entity2			2
as @entity22 talks , a little distance away @entity45 and two other man are digging , @entity45 served 10 years in prison for his crimes during the genocide , among them the murder of @entity22 's father			1
the locale is where , @entity45 believes , the body was buried 20 years ago			2
for victim and perpetrator , coming together to finally bury with dignity those who died has become an act of penance			1
" i confessed and told the truth of what happened so i was released from prison -- when i came out i found the people we had committed crimes against , " @entity45 said			2
" be it the mother of this boy and the boy himself			0
even though i was scared , they also got scared to see me			0
i managed to get close to them though , through other people that helped me to get a better way of reaching them			0
and it happened slowly by slowly			0
" " we came together saying these hands we are using are for all @entity1 -- because these hands destroyed the country , we have to use them to rebuild it			1
" across @entity1 thousands of " genocidaires " as they 're called are still in custody			1
those found guilty of involvement in the genocide can only be released by presidential pardon			1
the last was seven years ago , when 8,000 were released back in to their communities			0
in @entity97 54 - year - old @entity96 waits to hear whether she will be among those set free			0
@entity96 was part of the @entity101 militia , the @entity9 militia intent on wiping out all trace of the @entity8 as she remembers the horrors she inflicted 20 years ago , even she is unable to explain how it happened			1
" i am not proud of it			0
the people i lived with and the people i worked with could never understand why i became an @entity101 , a killer ... every time i think about it , i am crying always			0
" her one hope , she says , is that one day she , too , will be able to eventually seek out those she wronged and play a role in her nation 's healing			0
" the genocide will never fade out -- even to killers or those who participated , like us , that picture , where ( the ) international community has seen you as a killer -- can never go away from you easily , and just say it is over , " says @entity96			1
" but my hope is not for me -- it is for my children and those who are linked to me , that they can never be part of what i went through			0
" as the sun begins to set @entity22 and his father 's killers are still digging and still hoping			2
giving up , @entity22 says , is not an option			0
" i will continue looking for him until i find him			0
whenever they tell me that they suspect where he might be -- i will use all means possible to find him			0
" and when he does , @entity45 will be right by his side , hoping to finally make amends for the horrors he inflicted all those years ago			0
