@entity0 , aka @entity1 , is thinking of leaving @entity2 and perhaps @entity3 because , according to his own reckoning , he is facing tax rates of 62 % or 63 %			1
@entity0 , probably the second - most - famous professional golfer in the world after @entity7 , later backed off from his initial comments about making " drastic changes			2
" reports suggest that @entity0 earned more than $ 60 million in 2012			2
in that sense , he appears to be doing better than the @entity12 , and perhaps you are not all that sympathetic to him			0
the @entity12 ( remember them ? ) paid so little tax			0
in 2011 , @entity15 and @entity16 paid federal taxes of $ 2 million on reported income of $ 14 million , for an effective tax rate of 14 % , all roughly			2
the @entity12 even had to foreswear taking all of their available charitable deductions to make their tax rate seem so high for appearance 's sake			2
it does bear noting that @entity0 is doing something to earn his $ 60 million			2
whoever is paying him that much believes that he is worth it			0
who are we , really , to argue ? @entity0 's instinctive reactions to high tax rates , even if his math may be a bit muddled , are sound and sensible ones			1
@entity7 certainly agrees with him			0
but that is not the problem in the story			0
@entity1 faces such seemingly inescapably high tax rates that he might just pack up his golf bags and leave home			1
@entity15 pays so little tax that he has to ignore the law to pay a higher rate for appearance 's sake			0
how can this be ? the @entity1 paradox has a simple explanation : in @entity3 , we tax work			1
we do not tax capital or wealth much at all			2
indeed , if you have wealth already , taxes are essentially optional under what i call tax planning 101 , the simple advice to buy / borrow / die			1
in step one , you buy assets that rise in value without producing cash , such as growth stocks or real estate			0
in step two , you borrow to finance your lifestyle			0
in step three , you die , and your heirs get your assets , tax free , and with a " stepped up " basis that eliminates all capital gains			0
@entity75 , with a personal fortune estimated at $ 250 million ( his five kids have another $ 100 million ) has figured this out			0
when he pays taxes , at all , he does so at the low capital gains rate			0
he is a wage - earner , albeit a very highly paid one , and he 's going to pay over one - half of his income in taxes if he stays in @entity2			1
we may not be shedding any tears for @entity1 any more than we feel for @entity87 , who recently left @entity88 for @entity89 to escape taxes , or for the @entity91 , who many moons ago left @entity94 and recorded @entity95 from @entity88			1
yet one fact not making news is that it is still the case that the highest marginal tax rates in @entity3 do not fall on the highest incomes , like @entity1 , but on certain of the working poor , many of them single parents , who are being taxed at rates approaching 90 % as they lose benefits attempting to better themselves			1
it 's a " poverty trap " that works just like the severe marriage penalties for the lower - income classes			0
but the working poor do not have the options of going to @entity111 , @entity89 or @entity88			0
@entity1 has a point -- high tax rates create disincentives			1
if the rates are high enough , people react by moving			0
this should not surprise us : @entity3 companies have been fleeing our shores for years , in droves			0
but this should worry us , for two reasons			0
one , the fact that the high incomers do flee jurisdictions , or flee from the productive activity of working , is a bad thing for the @entity3 two , the very risk that the rich and famous might leave , aided by the appearance that some do , holds tax reform hostage			0
we have struggled to raise rates at all on the rich , blocked by the mostly mythical @entity135 as much as by the realities of @entity0 or the @entity91			1
when we do finally raise rates , as we did at the fiscal cliff , we do so on the wrong rich , in the wrong way			0
@entity1 's taxes went up , @entity15 's need not			1
the problem -- and it is the same problem as with @entity15 's taxes -- is that we are taxing the wrong thing , in the wrong way			1
in sum , we tax work , not wealth			1
we should be taxing the act of spending , not the socially beneficial ones of work and savings			1
then we could raise tax rates without fear of ill effects			1
@entity15 's taxes would go up , for he is surely spending more than $ 14 million a year , as by running for president , and we would n't need any special capital gains preference under a consistent spending tax			1
@entity1 's taxes would go down to the extent he saves some of his $ 60 million , helping us all by working and saving			1
when and if @entity0 or his kids spend , we could tax him or them then			2
and if @entity1 is really insisting on both earning and spending $ 60 million a year ? well , i figure he can buy a lot of borscht in @entity89 with that .			2

golf star @entity0 is thinking of leaving @entity2 to avoid paying high taxes
@entity169 : @entity1 has a point -- high tax rates create disincentives
he says the problem is that we tax work , not wealth ; this is is backward
@entity169 : we should be taxing the act of spending , not that of work and savings
