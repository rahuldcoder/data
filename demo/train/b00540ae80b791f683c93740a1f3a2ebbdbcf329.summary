-- on the day that @entity2 announced that he would accept an employment offer from the @entity4 , i had a conversation with a person you would not automatically associate with basketball expertise			1
but it was n't basketball i wanted to ask him about			1
it was the fleeting nature of celebrity -- even of the most incandescent celebrity			1
@entity2 is enjoying that kind of fame right now			1
it seems that you ca n't walk down a city street without hearing someone mention his name			2
but a person 's moment in the sun comes and goes			2
the passions , both good and bad , that a star inspires can cool off in a relatively short span			2
which is an instructive thing to keep in mind at times like these			2
the person with whom i spoke was @entity33 , co-owner of the famous @entity34 on @entity35 in @entity36			2
for generations , the stage has been a part of @entity36 life			1
the triple - decker sandwiches at the stage have traditionally been named for famous men and women			2
the idea is to appeal to customers whose eyes will be drawn to an item on the menu because of the celebrity associated with it			1
so i asked @entity33 about the no. 8 -- the sandwich called the @entity54			2
it features turkey , ham and swiss cheese			2
it was n't always known as the @entity54 , @entity33 said			2
its name was changed in recent years from what it was formerly called			2
diners , it seemed , were no longer quite as attracted to the old name of the no. 8 : the @entity67			1
same with the no. 18 ( turkey , chopped liver , lettuce , tomato , onion )			0
it 's a hit , in large part because of the bigger - than - life @entity36 figure for whom it is named : @entity79			1
the @entity79 sandwich appeals to a new generation of customers who might not feel as strong a connection with what the same triple - decker was called until not so long ago : the @entity86			1
" the clientele changes , " @entity33 told me			0
younger customers come along who might not be as familiar with the old famous names			1
" @entity93 , 60 years ago , was as famous as a person could be in the @entity95			1
he was the first major television star -- magazines and newspapers referred to him as mr. @entity93			1
his tuesday evening broadcasts were so popular that in some cities , restaurants and movie theaters closed their doors on that night because they could n't compete with him			0
the world and all of its rewards were his , and so was the no. 12 at the @entity34 : roast beef , chopped liver , onion			0
no one 's eyes could scan the big menu without stopping at the @entity93			1
but that was long ago			0
the @entity114 has a different name now , one with more cachet : the @entity117			0
" @entity120 " took care of that			0
" the celebrity thing is hard to keep up with , " @entity33 said			1
" it used to be that fame lasted for 30 or 40 years			1
now , it seems to pop up and then it 's gone			0
someone like @entity127 comes along , and everyone is talking about her , and next thing you know you do n't hear her name and everyone 's talking about someone else			0
" for all the hyperbolic verbiage during that @entity2 television special ( " you 're now looking live at the king " ) , for all the incomprehensible financial figures being thrown around about other @entity143 players who recently have agreed to terms ( one , it was said , signed a six - year deal for $ 123 million , another signed a four - year deal for $ 80 million ) , perhaps a small dose of perspective is needed			1
the sports analysts often ask if events like the frantic courtship of @entity2 are a distraction for the various teams involved			1
but of course , that 's what professional sports are : a distraction			0
that 's what the public is buying : a few hours of distraction from the matters in this world that are genuinely troubling , the ones that ca n't always be solved with certainty when the final buzzer sounds			0
the welcome distraction that all of this provides is at the core of its inherent value			0
is it any wonder that the players in the middle of it sometimes can become a little disoriented ? during the @entity182 ' recent @entity181 playoff run to the @entity183 , many fans in the @entity177 in @entity178 , @entity179 , wore the replica jersey of the team 's captain , @entity187 , who turned 22 years old this spring			0
one of the people in the arena wearing a @entity187 jersey was a 47 - year - old fan : @entity193			0
what must it be like for @entity187 , knowing that @entity193 is not only watching him play , but also wearing his jersey ? it all moves along so quickly ; on the day in 1988 that @entity187 was born in @entity200 , @entity201 , the papers carried stories saying that @entity193 had scored 50 points in a playoff victory over the @entity205 on this same stretch of @entity207 where he now sat cheering for @entity187			0
no one could be more famous than @entity2 , this week			1
even the president of the @entity95 was talking about him			0
at the @entity34 in @entity211 , @entity33 had a decision to make			0
" people want to see recognizable names , " he said			1
" names that are popular			1
" for years , the no. 24 ( twin rolls of pastrami and corned beef ) was known as the @entity219			0
then , as the sands of renown shifted , it was changed to the @entity223			0
@entity33 believes that it 's time for the no. 24 to evolve again			0
he is considering various candidates			0
" nothing lasts forever , " he said			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity2 is an incandescent celebrity , with tens of millions *paying* attention
@entity230 notes that even the greatest celebrities eventually become part of *history*
@entity67 , @entity93 , @entity86 once were *household* names
@entity230 notes that for such stars of the past , fame proved fleeting
