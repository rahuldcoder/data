along a winding @entity1 mountain road dotted with inns and restaurants is @entity4 , a place of refuge and site for troubled parents to dump unwanted children			1
the government - run orphanage in eastern @entity1 opened its first baby hatch on june 1 , @entity13 , as a symbolic step to show the country 's commitment to improving child welfare			1
however , it since proved so popular that authorities have had to introduce new rules to limit the number of babies and children being abandoned			1
in just 11 days , 106 children , all with disabilities or medical conditions , were dropped off at the @entity28 facility , according to local state media			1
that is more than the 85 orphans the city accepted the entire previous year			1
in one reported case , a six - year - old girl was pushed out of a car in front of the hatch			1
in her pocket was $ 430 and a piece of paper with her birth date and time written on it , according to state media			0
waiting outside the hatch @entity44 waited outside the hatch on a tuesday afternoon to see how often it was being used			2
the hatch is a small , detached room at the side of the orphanage , equipped with a crib , incubator and air conditioning			2
once the child 's guardian leaves the hatch , the door locks and an alarm sounds , alerting staff to the anonymous drop			2
in the first of two attempted drops , two men walked up to the hatch and started taking photos of a sign with detailed instructions on how to drop off a baby			1
the instructions said that parents should leave a date of birth , as well as details of any medical conditions the child may have			1
it also asked people not to take any equipment from the hatch			2
half an hour later , the same two men pulled up in a silver hatchback with a woman in the back			0
orphanage workers and guards scurried over to the car			0
the woman told them her baby had a congenital heart disease and they had no money to treat her			2
the workers advised the woman to take her baby to the city hospital , which provides free medical services			1
if she could not be treated there , then she could bring the baby back , they said			2
the men quickly got back into the car drove away			0
the second drop , only one hour later , involved a 21 - year - old man from @entity97 , a province in southwestern @entity1 , who walked up the busy road , cradling a baby and a bag of belongings			1
as the man went to the hatch , orphanage staff and guards stood in his way , preventing him from opening the door			1
he walked back defeated , silent and stony - faced			0
when @entity44 caught up to him , he broke down in tears , sobbing as he held his baby closer to his chest			2
his son , dressed in clean clothes and a bonnet , was sleeping			0
the young man said his baby had water on the brain			2
" i just want to leave him there because with the state at least he has hope			0
we 've spent everything , " he said as he wept			0
the man walked back about a half a mile down the road where his uncle had parked after driving him to the hatch			2
when asked why the orphanage would not accept the baby , the staff replied , " he 's not allowed			2
we only accept people from this city			0
" the orphanage staff told the father to travel back to his hometown in @entity97 -- more than 1,000 miles away on the other side of the country -- to drop off his baby			2
new rules imposed the locals - only rule was applied soon after the hatch opened to try to limit numbers			1
now , babies must also be less than one year old , and can only be dropped off between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. a handful of police , orphanage workers and volunteers stand guard at the hatch 24 hours a day , making it increasingly difficult for any parent to abandon a child anonymously			1
the country is divided on the topic of hatches , with many believing that the government is condoning child abandonment and even encouraging it by opening hatches			0
outside the hatch are prominently placed slogans condemning child abandonment , a reminder from the government that the practice is technically illegal , even though the provision of baby hatches amounts to turning a blind eye to that			1
history of @entity1 's hatches the first pilot hatch was introduced in 2011			0
now there are 32 across the country , according to the official @entity177 news agency			0
" we had to find a more humane way to take in abandoned babies , " said dr. @entity178 , one of the founders for @entity1 's child welfare policy and a retired @entity182 official			1
" in reality , children were being thrown into trash cans , on the side of roads , in front of hospitals , or in front of the @entity182 so we had to standardize it and regulate it			0
" according to @entity196 , there were around 712,000 orphans in @entity1 in 2010 , but child welfare groups believe that the number could be in the millions if you account for children in non-government orphanages and foster homes			1
unlike in the 1980s and 90s , when most abandoned babies were girls , now most suffer from a range of disabilities and medical conditions , such as cerebral palsy , down syndrome , congenital heart disease , club feet and cleft lips			1
changing attitudes , improving welfare @entity178 said baby hatches were a step in the right direction for the country , but acknowledged that changing mindsets and improving social welfare would pose a challenge in the years to come			0
" if you do n't give up your child , then nobody will help you , " @entity178 told @entity44			0
" but once you abandon your child , the government must take over			0
" " this is not a good solution			0
instead the government should step forward to subsidize parents and enable them to take care of their children			0
this is a simple truth that is hard to explain to society			0
" according to @entity178 , @entity1 has only 10,000 social workers handling 100,000 abandoned children , a ratio of one social worker to ten orphans			1
in more developed nations , the ratio is normally two social welfare workers to every orphaned child , he said			0
the @entity182 seems to have recognized the problem and has set an ambitious target of increasing the number of social welfare workers to two million by 2015			0
until then , it 's likely the hatches will continue to be used by parents too poor or too overwhelmed to keep their children at home			1
@entity1 's ' baby hatch ' numbers set to increase ' @entity254 ' overwhelmed in southern @entity1 city			1

@entity28 ' baby hatch ' overwhelmed since opening on june 1
over 100 children abandoned , all had disabilities or medical conditions
@entity264 has had to introduce new rules to reduce number of babies , children
babies must now be less than one year old , from the local area
