-- walking through a hushed cemetery at night with only a flashlight to guide your way can be a stirring experience for amateur ghost hunters this @entity7			1
" a lot of paranormal societies use graveyards for training grounds , " said @entity8 , author of more than 20 books on the subject			1
" if you get an @entity18 reading in a graveyard , there is no electricity there , so it has to be coming from some other source			1
" oftentimes , the spirits you may encounter in a cemetery are n't kind or frightening but rather full of grief in this final resting place			1
" oddly enough , a lot of cemeteries are n't that haunted , " said @entity28 , a historian and ghost hunter of 33 years			1
" people haunt where they loved			1
the idea of haunting a cemetery outside of someone who is grieving -- that 's what we 're picking up , the grief of a person , rather than their spirit linked to a site			2
" however , there are still an abundance of spirits roaming their final resting place , he said			2
@entity49 shared what he regards as some of the most haunted cemeteries in @entity53			1
visiting one of these historic sites just may introduce you to someone , or something , waiting on the other side			2
@entity61 cemetery no. 1 , @entity62 @entity64 with history and lore , @entity62 ' above - ground cemeteries have been inspiration for storytellers and authors alike			1
before these elaborate tombs were built , the ground often gave up the recently buried during floods or heavy rains			2
because the city is situated below the water table , burial was not a practical option , and the small cities of above - ground tombs began			2
cemetery no. 1 is perhaps the most famous of @entity62 ' cemeteries			1
visitors have witnessed phantom figures , @entity85 ghosts and yellow fever victims restlessly stalking through the maze of crypts , @entity49 said			2
but perhaps the most well - known spirit is that of @entity90 , the city 's own voodoo queen			1
she is often seen walking the grounds			2
" she haunts her tomb , " @entity49 said			2
" if you go there , take along a piece of chalk , make 3 x 's on her tomb , and if you ask a prayer or request , she will help you get it			2
" after pausing , @entity49 added , " it 's a pretty creepy place			2
i do n't know if i want to be there at night			2
" @entity105 , @entity106 not all cemetery hauntings involve walking through a graveyard at night			2
@entity106 's most famous spirit is really just looking for some company , and a way home			2
the locals call her " @entity114 , " @entity49 said			0
she is seen not only within the cemetery but just outside of the gates			0
if you 're driving through the area , she just may try to hitch a ride			0
over the years , thousands of people have reported a young woman who flags down passing cars for a ride home			0
when they ask for an address , she supplies that of the cemetery			0
often , " @entity134 " vanishes in the car or steps out at the cemetery and fades into darkness , @entity49 said			0
during the ' 30s , a @entity136 woman between the ages of 17 and 22 was on her way back from a dance at the @entity140 when she was killed in a car accident			0
she was buried in @entity114 , and locals believe that this is " @entity134			0
" she is always seen wearing a vintage ball gown and seems incredibly lifelike -- until she vanishes			0
@entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 not only is this cemetery full of @entity146 legends from the silent film era to our recently departed celebrities , @entity49 says it is also full of ghosts			1
and they do n't just come out at night ; you can see @entity146 's ghosts during the day			0
before @entity158 died , he made a habit of visiting hospitals and spending time with children			1
he spoke to one little girl who was going to have an operation and offered her words of encouragement			0
the girl survived her operation and recovered			0
when @entity158 died , she vowed to visit his grave each year and place a red rose on his gravestone			1
she became known as " the lady in black , " and she was quite visible in the ' 30s			0
but when the lady in black died , her ghost carried on the tradition			1
both her and @entity158 's ghosts have been seen by his grave , @entity49 said			1
of course , these are just a couple of the site 's rumored hauntings			1
@entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 once a rollicking silver rush town , @entity183 is now the true embodiment of a ghost town			1
the scenes of incredible violence that took place in its lawless streets still resonate , especially the infamous gunfight at the @entity193 among the @entity194 , the @entity195 and @entity196			0
three of the @entity199 gang were killed in the fight , which only lasted about 30 seconds			0
they now rest in @entity182 , alongside gamblers , smugglers and outlaws , @entity49 said			0
there are dozens of " boot hill " cemeteries across the country , especially the @entity208			1
the name refers to those who " died with their boots on " or in a violent way			0
but @entity183 's cemetery , and the entire town , is considered to be one of the most haunted			1
ghosts of outlaws and the @entity199 gang are often seen in the cemetery , hoping to avenge their death			0
" @entity183 is a true place for ghost hunters to go , " @entity49 said			1
" it is chock full of haunted sites , and the cemetery is but one			1
" @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 the site of one of the deadliest battles in @entity53 history is naturally still haunted by the vestiges of war , where families clashed and broke apart on the battlefield during a staggering three - day campaign			1
the battlefield itself became a burial ground for thousands of men , many of whom were later relocated to proper graves			0
the @entity245 offers a final resting place for all of the men who never made it home			0
shadowy phantom figures in both @entity250 and @entity252 uniforms still pace the battlefield and cemetery			0
but @entity49 notes that one of the most persistent ghosts is really just there to be social			0
in the cemetery , a man is often seen wearing a black hat with a star , symbolic of one of the @entity263 regiments fighting with the @entity264 at @entity227			0
he often tries to converse with tourists and on several occasions has posed with families for photos or takes a photo of family if they request it , @entity49 said			0
during photo development or even on the camera 's screen , the man disappears			0
for an encapsulating haunted experience , @entity49 recommends staying in the @entity276			1
@entity252 snipers hid in the house during the battle , and their ghosts roam the rooms today			0
if you go should you decide to stop by any of these cemeteries and go on your own ghost hunt , @entity49 has a few words of advice			1
remember to be respectful of those who have passed on , and do n't disturb any grave to try to incite a ghost			1
" you should be like a ghost : no one should know you 've even been there , " @entity49 said .			1
