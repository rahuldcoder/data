though some are genre - exclusive , most showcase acts playing everything from bluegrass to hip hop			0
are you prepared to camp ? for festivals like @entity78 and @entity79 , much of the experience is about pitching your tent and camping out for the weekend			1
some camping events do offer luxury cabins or tents in return for higher ticket prices			0
cover story : what is @entity78 ? most festivals provide maps pre-arrival , so you 'll want to know where the camping areas are in relation to the parking and stages			1
if the distance is far , try to keep your gear light or invest in a small pull wagon or cart			0
depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action ( many festivals run 24 hours ) , you 'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages , scattered across the grounds , or both			1
bring the usual camping gear -- tent , sleeping bag , etc. -- and do n't forget a car charger for your phone , laptop and other gadgets			1

are hotels an option ? if you 're attending a festival located in a city or metropolitan area , such as @entity13 in @entity123 , getting a hotel room for the weekend on your own is an option , or you can take advantage of the festival 's package lodging deals			1
learn the local history before you go as with all travel , having a cultural awareness of where you 're going can enrich your festival experience and take you beyond simple enjoyment of the music			1

being clued in on local culture and history will also help if you plan on venturing away during the show to give your ears a rest or want to take a pre- or post-festival excursion to visit nearby attractions			2
stretch your comfort zone one of the best parts about the summer music festival experience is observing the meshing of different cultures and being around new groups of people			1
