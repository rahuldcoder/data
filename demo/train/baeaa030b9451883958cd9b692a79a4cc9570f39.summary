@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was once the kind of guy who might sing a little @entity7 in the shower , or even club - hop with actual @entity7 artists			1
what different times those were for the mayor of @entity0			1
@entity3 was born and raised in @entity13 but long ago built a life in the city symbolic of the country 's rise and crash			1
he was drafted by the @entity19 in 1966 and played with the team for nine seasons			0
after his basketball career ended , he returned to the city to launch an automotive supplier , @entity24			0
he spent 29 years building the business , he said , and by 2008 he thought maybe it was time to retire			0
@entity27 had once supported former mayor @entity28 , but not after @entity28 tumbled deep into scandal that led to his resignation and a jail sentence			2
a small group of friends convinced @entity3 to run , he said , and he won the chance to finish @entity28 's term in 2009			1
later that year , he secured a full term			0
sports , @entity3 said , taught him how to work on a team , to understand skills and weaknesses			1
business showed him how to find and grow talent , how to recognize his own skills and weaknesses			0
none of it could have prepared him to run @entity1 's largest city			2
@entity27 has n't announced yet whether he 'll run for re-election next year			2
" it was in much worse condition than i ever anticipated , " @entity3 said of @entity0			1
" we 're working through the process as i speak , but it 's probably the second most difficult job in this country behind the president			1
" indeed , he 's facing the threat of bankruptcy , stalemates with city council and hard , sometimes raucous talks with @entity0 residents and city workers			1
this summer hecklers riled about city pay cuts shouted him down during a community meeting			0
one day later , @entity3 was calm , too busy to think long about chants and criticism			1
there 's no time for it , he said			2
no time anymore to sing , no time for late nights on the town			0
there 's hardly time to sleep , he said			2
but it does n't change his belief in the city that fills his memory and dominates his thoughts			2
so , @entity2 asked @entity3 : in a city notorious for its troubles , what would you want visitors or residents to see ? here are some of his answers			1
@entity0 's riverfront " we have something that 's distinct from almost any city in the country , " @entity3 says , a view across a waterway and into another country			1
" it 's beautiful , " he said			2
@entity0 's riverfront draws together public space , art and events , especially along the @entity98			1
within a few years , he expects there to be more attractions , commerce and living space along the water			0
it 's the @entity0 , but the city needs to give more people more reasons to get out and walk , he said			1
@entity108 high on @entity27 's list of must - sees for @entity0 is a trip to the @entity108 , a 658,000 - square - foot , 100 - gallery museum founded in 1885			1
its collection features @entity116 , @entity115 , @entity117 , @entity115 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity122 and ancient art , as well as collections of modern and graphic art. " i think the @entity108 is probably renowned worldwide , " @entity3 said			1
earlier this year , metro @entity0 voters went for a property tax increase that will supply the museum with an estimated $ 23 million annually for 10 years			1
the funding is expected to help stabilize the museum 's budget and dodge dramatic cuts to exhibitions , education and hours			2
the museum now offers free admission to residents of the three counties that approved the tax			2
" huge investments had been made in a lot of our cultural institutions , " @entity3 said			1
even as other parts of the city struggled , " i think that 's one thing we 've held on to			2
" @entity147 when @entity3 moved to @entity0 in the 1960s , he came as a basketball player , a celebrity of sorts			1
he slipped right in to the nightlife of the time , and that meant @entity7			0
" the athletes , we always thought we were entertainers , and the entertainers thought they were athletes , " he said			0
" we really got together quite often			0
" @entity157 , the @entity158 , the @entity159 , the @entity160 -- he said he knew them all well			0
" you fell in love with them because they were true entertainers , " he said			0
he 's too busy now to sing , but anybody who comes to town should know that history , he said			2
some of it is kept up at the @entity147 , a music - studio - turned - museum known as @entity171 , @entity116 , founded in 1985			1
" people do n't realize how @entity7 got started , where it got started			0
i mean , it was a little house , " @entity3 said			1
" for all the success they had out of that one little place , people need to see that			0
" @entity0 's @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 -- and @entity19 ? @entity27 is proud to call @entity0 home to four professional sports teams -- the @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity19			1
he loves the energy of a game , the pride teams bring to the city and the crowds in stadiums and restaurants			0
but as an @entity192 who came to @entity0 for basketball , he 'd rather the @entity19 move back to the city from their suburban home , the @entity197			1
he did n't lay out a plan for how to make it happen , but he said it 's a goal			2
" my whole career in basketball was downtown , and i think that 's where it belongs , and i 'll do everything i can to try to get it back downtown , " he said			0
the future " there are several very strong neighborhoods in our city , " he said , the areas around @entity215 and @entity0 's downtown , especially			1
but he 's optimistic about what comes next			0
here 's his prediction for what visitors and residents will see in a decade : " instead of seeing the vast amount of empty land where there 's nobody there , i think we 've got to do some different things			1
urban farming is something we 've been talking about for some time			0
we will probably see some of that			0
" we would see people living out in neighborhoods where there 's only one or two homes			0
we 're not going to see that			0
we 're going to try to convince those people to move so there 's density in all of our neighborhoods , so we can really look out for each other , we can help protect each other , we can bring people and families back together again like it used to be			0
where we care for each other , where we support each other			0
that 's the kind of city i see			0

@entity253 hall of famer @entity3 became @entity0 's mayor in 2009
" it 's probably the second most difficult job in this country behind the president , " @entity3 said
@entity3 offered up five ca n't - miss things in @entity0 for visitors or residents
some spots , like the @entity147 , are already famous ; some he hopes will be
