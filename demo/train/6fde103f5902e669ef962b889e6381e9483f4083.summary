-- a 6 - foot - 4 football player is more than a million times the size of a typical @entity4 bacterium			2
but under the right conditions , that athlete could find himself defenseless against the microscopic bug			0
@entity8 recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up			1
the problem came to the forefront last week with @entity13 player @entity8 , who recently had his second staph infection			1
he is reportedly the sixth player to acquire staph among the @entity13 in five years			1
@entity8 recently said the @entity13 treated him like a " piece of meat " when he was hospitalized for the condition , and he claimed they covered up the cause of his illness			1
after @entity8 spoke out , the organization suspended him for one game , then rescinded the suspension after a settlement with @entity8 over the weekend			2
the @entity13 said in a statement saturday that the team and @entity8 had worked through their differences , and that the team looked forward to his return			1
@entity8 joined the team again monday			2
@entity33 of the @entity34 was revealed to have a staph infection , the @entity32 reported friday			0
@entity37 fans also recently learned that @entity38 , the 7 - foot - 7 center on the basketball team , had a staph infection complication that led to part of his foot being amputated			1
it 's unclear how these high - profile athletes acquired their infections , but locker rooms have been found to habor staph bacteria in previous outbreaks			1
the topic is generating buzz throughout the sports world as more players ' staph cases are revealed			0
hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph , but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings			1
regardless of where these players got their infections , the close quarters of a locker room raise questions about overall risks			0
about 30 percent of people carry staph in their noses without exhibiting symptoms , according to the @entity70			1
experts say @entity72 , or @entity72 , a form of staph resistant to common antibiotics , has become a more prevalent problem in settings such as contact sports that involve skin - to - skin touching			1
most mrsa infections acquired in community settings present themselves as sores or boils and often appear red , swollen , painful or with drainage such as pus , the @entity70 says			1
infections often occur in cuts and abrasions but also on body parts covered in hair , such as the back of the neck , armpit or groin			0
schools , prisons and other crowded environments are particularly known for transmitting @entity72 , said			0
@entity97 , professor of epidemiology at @entity100 's @entity99			0
@entity72 may spread particularly easily among athletes because they have repeated skin - to - skin contact , share items and surfaces that touch skin and have a hard time staying clean , the @entity70 says			1
athletes often get cuts and abrasions ; @entity72 can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection			2
dr. @entity111 , medical director at @entity113 's @entity112 in @entity114 , @entity115 , said that environment plays a role in the spread of @entity72 but that it 's less a factor than coming into contact with a person 's skin			0
" if you have somebody who has an infection -- he has a draining infection -- and he gets some of his pus on a bench , that staph 's going to be there for hours or days before it dries out , " he said			2
" but the higher concentration is going to be on that person 's skin			0
" a second infection in the same person could result from re-exposure or from treatment that did n't get rid of the bacteria colonization , he said			0
@entity72 has been around in hospital settings since the 1970s , but community - associated mrsa was born in the late 1990s , and is now widespread in the community , said @entity70 spokesperson @entity143			1
a report from the @entity70 said that the deaths of four children from @entity72 in @entity150 and @entity151 during the late 1990s " demonstrate the potential severity of community - acquired @entity72 infections			1
" a study on the @entity153 published in the @entity154 in 2003 found that during the 2003 football season , there were eight mrsa infections among five of the 58 @entity153 players			0
to protect against @entity72 , the @entity70 recommends practicing good personal hygiene and taking care of your skin , which includes wearing protective clothing and covering cuts and abrasions with clean , dry bandages			1
also , do not share items that come into contact with your skin , such as towels , razors and ointments			1
put something between your skin and shared equipment -- for example , sit on a towel on a bench			1
@entity97 said she is not directly familiar with @entity8 's situation but understands the dilemma that a team would face if a player contracted a staph infection			2
there could be economic and psychosocial repercussions -- for example , another team might not want to play against that one , she said			0
but in general , other team members should be made aware of the situation so they do not share towels or engage in other behaviors that might transmit the infection			1
still , there is a danger of overreaction , she said			0
in some instances when a child in a public school has died , the whole school panicked and fumigated the facility , she said			0
" it 's a good idea to avoid that level of fear , because it 's costly and it scares people unnecessarily , " she said			0
on thursday , the @entity208 's general manager @entity207 said the team did not alert players to @entity8 's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in " game mode " when @entity8 had a confirmed diagnosis			2
" to come out and talk about that just was going to be another distraction , " @entity207 said on his regular weekly appearance on @entity217 in @entity13 , @entity218			2
" that 's our job , is to limit distractions as much as we can			0
" @entity8 said in a statement released through his publicist , @entity225 of @entity226 , that he had been discouraged from making the issue public			2
" this has nothing to do with football , and this has nothing to with my current contract situation , " he said			0
" this is a health concern			0
" a spokesperson for the @entity13 did not return a request for comment			2
an @entity238 representative said the league has no statement on the issue .			0
