-- from time to time , @entity1 can be seen teetering around a neighborhood drinking hole			0
she flirts with strangers , talks gibberish and sometimes spins in circles for no apparent reason until she falls down			0
in one hand is her liquid of choice -- watered - down orange juice in a sippy cup			0
the 14 - month - old toddler is the sort of barfly who 's at the center of a recurring and heated debate : should parents be allowed to bring their babies and children to bars ? it is a question in @entity24 , @entity25 , that 's fired up online arguments , prompted unofficial protests and made outsiders giggle			1
and while the issue may not be exclusive to that area , it 's the stuff disputes are made of in what @entity1 's dad , @entity32 , calls the kid - heavy " greater stroller zone " of @entity36 and its surrounding neighborhoods			1
single hipsters and others without ( and sometimes with ) kids complain about being asked to watch their language , to not smoke outdoors near strollers and to keep their drunk friends under control so as not to scare the little ones			1
they do n't want to feel pressure to play peekaboo			1
they want to cry over their beers , they say , without having an infant drown them out			0
if anyone is spitting up , they want it to be them			0
" i will get up on the subway for kids			0
i will be tolerant of them kicking the back of my seat while seeing a g - rated movie			1
but let me have my bars , " said @entity62 , 26 , who feels guilty sucking down suds in front of staring 5 - year - olds			1
the adults who bring their offspring to bars , she suggests , are " clinging to their youth			2
" parents , on the other hand , say that as long as they 're responsible and their kids behave , they deserve the right to grab a quick drink with friends			2
and , they might add , in a place like @entity25 -- where the cost of baby sitters can be prohibitive and tight living quarters can make hosting guests at home difficult -- they need places to hang out , too			0
" as a stay - at - home dad , it can be kind of isolating			0
bars , as much as they 're places to drink , they 're places to socialize and meet people , " said @entity1 , 35 , a freelance writer , an editor for the blog @entity88 and the columnist behind the @entity90 in the @entity91			2
" i long for adult contact			0
... i do n't want to be excluded from the adult world			2
" but the divide remains wide in the blogosphere			0
around 150 readers weighed in recently when someone posted on the @entity103 , a neighborhood blog , the simple query : " which bars are child free ? " one writer shared the tale of a drunk father standing at a bar while his beer sloshed on his stroller - strapped kid 's face			1
another poster announced a bar crawl in which " no crawlers " would be allowed			2
the public debate about babies in bars ignited about two years ago when the bar @entity121 , a popular stomping ground , banned strollers from the premises , @entity1 said			1
" at a certain point , owners said , ' hey , enough , ' " he explained			0
" strollers take up a lot of room , especially the nice strollers			2
your average @entity132 is a beast			0
" this ban on buggies in a neighborhood where " kids rule " caused an " uproar , " said @entity140 , the 36 - year - old married -- but not a " breeder , " she insists -- marketing director who is behind the blog f * * * * ed in @entity36			2
" there was n't a march on the street , but there could have been			2
[ @entity121 ] relented under pressure and got rid of the policy			0
" the owner of @entity121 would not talk to @entity0 , but an unnamed bartender -- who mentioned the bar had been issued tickets by the fire department at one point because strollers blocked exits -- confirmed that there is no such policy in place			1
in a part of the city where @entity163 says he sees " a sense of entitlement on both sides , " and where people do n't hold back their opinions -- " this is @entity24 , " he said -- he and his partners at @entity171 instituted a no - kids - after - 5 p.m. rule			1
" we 're a neighborhood gathering place , not a hard - drinking bar , and we 're not jerks about it " said @entity163 , a co-owner and the general manager			0
" but the overwhelming clientele that spends quite a lot of money here ca n't deal with babies			1
" rules like this , simple compromises , do n't bother @entity1 as they might other parents			1
he 's not interested in taking @entity1 out till all hours of the night anyway			0
but when he gets a little stir - crazy in their apartment , he likes to head out to grab a stout with his little girl			0
he 's not taking her to punk dive bars where the music is loud , fights break out and patrons make out or pass out			1
they gravitate to mellow hangouts , and only in the late afternoon or early evening			0
" i 'm not going to keep her out past 7 p.m. when the bar starts filling up , that 's when we head home , " he said			1
" it 's responsible parenting and responsible adult behavior			1
i 'm not knocking back double vodkas while my daughter is stumbling around			1

babies in bars are the subject of heated *discussion* in @entity24 , where strollers rule
singles do n't want to watch their language , behavior ; parents do n't want to be shut out
debate began when bar banned strollers ; policy *overturned* after outcry , blogger says
@entity229 says he 's " not knocking back double vodkas while my daughter is stumbling around "
