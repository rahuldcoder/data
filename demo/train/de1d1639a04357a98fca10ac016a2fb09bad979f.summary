@entity0 -- if the @entity3 followed the @entity5 presidential elections as avidly as the @entity5 stare at the poll ratings of @entity8 and @entity9 , they would know that " @entity10 , " @entity10 the @entity3 , may soon have to say " good bye " to the @entity11			1
the omens are bad and the possible demise of the most pro-american president in our history raises questions about our long and complex transatlantic relations			1
how will @entity5 election be decided ? not that there is so much to worry about			1
@entity10 's potential successor , the @entity22 , may have said that " the enemy is finance , " but he also told the @entity23 that before attending @entity24 , the alma mater of our elite public service , he had traveled to the @entity3 and written a report on the @entity3 fast food industry that foresaw the triumph of @entity30 's in @entity5 a decade later			1
the candidate even admitted a personal weakness for hamburgers -- a strategic cliché @entity3 is welcome to take as a token of transatlantic loyalty			2
but it is not always enough			0
remember @entity40 ? our former president gained real popularity in the @entity3 after telling @entity44 that in his youth he had worked as a soda jerk at a @entity48 hotel , and even dangerously overextended his vacations to date a southern belle who called him " @entity54 " and drove him around in a white @entity53 convertible			1
all this sincere devotion to @entity56 did n't spare him from being reviled later as the commander - in - chief of the " @entity58 " , unwilling to risk blood and treasure in the quest of weapons of mass destruction in @entity63			0
tons of " @entity72 , " the creative rants of @entity65 and @entity66 , even the sad visit to the @entity68 in 2004 of our then ambassador to check officially on the status of @entity5 ( " @entity74 ? " ) are enough proof that our relations can become sour and chaotic overnight			1
but hateful ? no. it 's just ... complicated			0
@entity78 , the man in the middle in 2004 , sincerely thought @entity3 and @entity5 could form a bona fide couple , be it " in therapy for the last 60 years			1
" and if the first rule of therapy is to verbalize , @entity5 has been vocal , to say the least			2
the official @entity5 explanation is that we both have strong and " radiating " cultures			2
the reality is that history has not made us equal			0
and it is sometimes painful			0
it was made worse , and personal , by @entity91 , when presidents @entity92 and @entity93 did n't embrace @entity94 , the only remnant of dignity of a battered country and the only symbolic redemption of a past that included a shaming defeat , a cruel occupation and the moral abyss of collaboration by @entity104 and @entity5 police			1
sure , @entity3 saved us			2
but it is sometimes hard to be saved , especially when your savior does n't seem to take you very seriously			2
no wonder the @entity5 flirted with grandiosity in the 1960s			2
the interior conquest made up for the loss of a colonial empire			0
the social protection , the nuclear show of force , the state - owned companies , the glowing technocratic elite and appeals to the developing world confirmed the victorious march of our " @entity124 " between @entity126 and @entity127			0
it is one of the reasons why , in contrast to most other western countries , the @entity5 conservative parties and its establishment never saw the @entity3 entrepreneurial way of business as a suitable model			1
it was even seen as a little vulgar			0
the change came with @entity10			2
his bourgeois but simple upbringing , his father 's foreign origin made him an unlikely candidate for the elite and all the more sensitive to the growth , creativity and class promotion promised by the @entity3 capitalism and meritocracy			1
he was also the first to suggest a system of affirmative action for the young descendants of immigrants locked in ghettos by decades of neglect and racism			0
but " @entity10 " became less @entity3 after the collapse of the markets in 2008 , less prone to show to @entity5 , as a model , a country where citizens actually demonstrate against government - run healthcare , less inclined to diversity when he needed the extreme right vote for his re-election			1
there was also a disappointment			0
if our president had gotten along much better than @entity40 with @entity66 since 2007 , he had great hopes to bask in the world aura of @entity9 , and even to replace the @entity178 as the closest ally of the @entity3			1
a rational and aloof @entity9 kept the unprecedented @entity5 love fest at bay			1
" the most @entity3 of the two is not who you would think , " a diplomat whispered to me after one of their first meetings , strangely mixing admiration , irony and plain old stereotypes			0
once again , @entity5 seemed to need the big mirror across the @entity195 to shape its identity and solve its anxieties			0
a colleague swore to me that @entity199 's @entity200 for " @entity201 " would offset the loss of our triple - a credit rating			0
in the middle of the @entity208 sex scandal last year , half of the @entity5 sneered at the " @entity209 " and its disgusting @entity210			0
the other half admired a country that would treat a rich and powerful man as badly as the common man			0
but both sides agreed to buy a magazine cover story that asked : " the @entity3 , what do they think of us ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1

possible demise of pro- @entity3 @entity5 president @entity10 raises questions over complex relations
love for @entity3 not always enough to ensure @entity3 *respect* for @entity5 , says @entity221
he says sometimes @entity5 's @entity91 savior , @entity3 , does n't seem to take it very seriously
@entity10 had *vainly* hoped to replace @entity178 as closest ally of @entity3
