-- @entity1 is heading to the @entity2 next week			1
@entity1 , a longtime traveler and author of an upcoming @entity5 book on @entity6 , is not dissuaded by the evacuation of the @entity9 and @entity10 embassies in @entity11 , rumblings of possible @entity14 airstrikes against @entity15 or rioting in @entity17			1
and it 's not because she 's reckless			2
she 's heading to the @entity19 and @entity20 for a month 's stay to report on a book about @entity24 language and culture in the @entity2			1
after her work there , she 'll head to @entity28 for more reporting			2
" they 're totally out of the fray , " @entity1 says			2
" @entity9 tend to think about the @entity2 as all one big country , but each place is distinct and has its own issues			1
" with violence in @entity11 and @entity6 escalating and a new travel warning for @entity11 issued tuesday , nervous @entity9 travelers will likely choose to avoid the entire @entity2 right now			1
however , @entity2 travel experts say that plenty of the region 's diverse destinations are still open for business and welcoming foreign visitors			1
know your tolerance level do n't go if you 're a worrywart and ca n't enjoy your trip			2
knowing there are no guarantees , travelers who get nervous when a car backfires may not enjoy the @entity2			1
" if you want to live life at the fullest , you have to take chances , " says @entity53 founder @entity52 , whether it 's traveling to @entity14 or @entity55 or the @entity56			2
" those who are afraid have to stay home and hope a plane does n't fall on their house			0
" consider a country that 's calm , such as the @entity19 or @entity20 , where travel agent @entity65 continues to send clients			1
" we 're sending lots of clients who switched their plans from @entity6 and still want to go to the desert and have fun , " says @entity65 , president of @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity69			1
" those two destinations are largely unaffected ( from the recent unrest ) or have even benefited from it			0
" in addition to @entity20 , the @entity19 and @entity28 , countries such as @entity80 and @entity14 are relatively safe right now			1
( @entity83 , though not part of the @entity2 , is an @entity84 - speaking nation and suffers from reduced tourism when there are difficulties in the @entity2			1
it is also considered safe for travel			1
) @entity14 is famous for not being loved by its neighbors , which means travelers there can expect a heightened state of security at all times , @entity52 says			1
from the time your bags are checked at the airport to guards checking your car at your hotel , everyone 's senses are heightened			0
that can make travel there safer because everyone knows to call police when he sees a suspicious package or unusual gathering of people			1
" if your guide says do n't go to @entity114 today , do n't be a smart guy and go anyway , " @entity52 says			0
most of the time it 's a false alarm and that 's ok			0
" the payoff of visiting one of the world 's holiest places is worth the heightened security , she says			2
" jews come to see where it all started and @entity127 to feel holy , " she says			0
" i hear the same thing over and over when people come home			0
' i 'm not the same person			0
it was a life - changing experience			0
' it 's worth the little bit of insecurity			0
" safe does n't mean easy whether you 're going to @entity6 to explore the pyramids without competition from other tourists or prefer to talk to locals about the emergence of democracy , @entity1 says it 's possible to avoid that country 's trouble spots			1
traveling there last fall during the uprisings , she found herself sharing the pyramids with a scattering of @entity152 and @entity6 tourists instead of the usual overwhelming crowds			1
" if you want to check out some serious archaeological , ancient stuff , it 's a great opportunity to be in the middle of history , " she says			0
though violent protests continue in @entity6 , @entity1 says most of @entity17 is safe , as long as you do n't get near the demonstrations			1
that means people wanting to travel to @entity17 right now need to know the layout of the city more than those flying directly to @entity166 to see @entity168 's tomb			2
or they need to hire a reputable tour operator who knows where to take them			0
even without unrest , independent travel is a constant negotiation			2
gone are the days when you could walk the streets of @entity17 without concern for your wallet			0
pickpockets are out and about , and @entity1 had a hard time avoiding vendors trying to sell her mini-replicas of alabaster pyramids and books about @entity186			0
" people are always wanting to sell you stuff , and that 's true no matter when you go , " she says			0
that 's why travel agent @entity191 prefers to have control of her guests ' entire travel package from start to finish , knowing they 'll be with guides and drivers she trusts			1
@entity201 , an @entity6 specialist who owns admiral @entity202 in @entity204 , @entity205 , is still booking clients to the @entity2 , alerting them that they 'll see bomb - sniffing dogs at hotels , armed guards and other security measures			1
if you are visiting a conservative religious country or section of the country , be aware of cultural norms and dress modestly			0
do n't be fooled by locals wearing @entity220 - style clothing			0
it may be @entity220 design but still modest in its coverage			0
ask your travel agent about exceptions to the rule for beach resorts			2
" i do tell people from a dress code standard to be respectful of the religion , " @entity201 says			0
" do n't show shoulders and do n't wear short shorts			0
you do n't want the men or women to stare at you			0
" government travel warnings make sure you review and discuss relevant safety warnings with travel providers as you 're booking a trip to the @entity2			1
the @entity240 lists its travel warnings online			2
the @entity242 offers detailed information and advice about threats to traveler safety in the region on its website .			2
