-- @entity1 beat @entity2 in three sets to defend her @entity5 title in @entity5 on sunday in a bizarre match played in sometimes heavy rain and amid the distraction of football fans gathering nearby			1
@entity1 was 6 - 4 4 - 0 down but fought back to take the match into a deciding tiebreak -- after saving a match point at 6 - 5 in the third set			1
by the time the tiebreak came around , the rain was falling heavily , making conditions unplayable , and it even started to rain again when the players returned two hours later to complete the match			1
@entity1 eventually won it 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 7 - 6 ( 5 ) and the two players burst out laughing when they shook hands at the net			1
" it was a crazy match , " @entity1 said			2
" either one of us could have won it			0
there really is no loser			0
" the men 's final between @entity32 and @entity33 was postponed until monday because of the weather -- prompting some fans to throw objects onto the court in disgust			1
nearby , @entity40 and @entity41 fans were gathering for the @entity43 final at the nearby @entity44 , and the final was punctuated by the sound of fireworks going off and police helicopters flying overhead			2
" the match was a joke , it was like playing a football match in the rain , " said @entity2 , who came close to her first title since winning the @entity49 almost a year ago			1
" even when we were sent off court , you had to still concentrate for every second , it was tiring for both players			0
" you could not relax			0
when we came back out , she was the tougher player			0
but i take some positives away			0
it 's getting close to @entity49 and i think i hit the ball well			2
i also moved her around the court well			0
" @entity1 heads to @entity49 with a second clay - court title of the year under her belt			1
not traditionally a threat on the slow surface , the world no. 2 has only lost once on clay in 2012 -- to @entity76			2
" this is a great win for me going into @entity49 , " @entity1 said			1
" it will be nice to have a week off now , after playing three tournaments in the last four weeks			0
i 'll have to time to recover , mentally and physically			0
" @entity1 can complete a career @entity81 if she wins in @entity82 .			2
