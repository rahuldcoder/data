-- a 19 - year - old @entity3 man was charged with capital murder tuesday in the death of an @entity7 man who died after allegedly being beaten by a group of white teens and run over by a truck , authorities said			1
@entity11 , 19 , of @entity12 , @entity3 was also charged by a grand jury with hate - crime enhancement in the murder of @entity16 , said @entity18 district attorney @entity17			1
the indictment alleges that @entity11 killed @entity20 while in the commission of committing felony robbery , @entity17 said in a statement			1
@entity20 's family , however , is asking state and federal officials not to seek the death penalty in the case			1
relatives of @entity20 , who died shortly after receiving his injuries on june 26 , sent a letter with their request to @entity17 , saying the family is opposed to the death penalty partly for religious reasons			2
the indictment against @entity11 alleged @entity20 was targeted because of his race			1
@entity11 's arraignment has yet to be scheduled , @entity17 said			2
federal authorities have joined the local investigation , and both authorities are determining " the appropriate venue for the prosecution of any remaining suspects , " @entity17 's statement said			0
" all options are being considered and with each passing day , more evidence is being gathered , " @entity17 said			0
the death of @entity20 , 48 , occurred early june 26 in @entity49 , allegedly at the hands of white teens who , after a night of partying and drinking , decided to go looking for black people to assault , law enforcement officials have said , quoting one of the suspects in the case			1
watch : incident caught on video @entity20 's death drew national attention after @entity0 first reported it and aired exclusive surveillance video of the killing , captured by a parking lot security camera in a @entity49 suburb			2
@entity17 , the district attorney , has called it " vicious " and a " premeditated hate crime			2
" the @entity70 @entity69 is investigating the death as a possible federal hate crime and assisting local prosecutors			0
the killing has also prompted several large marches and prayer vigils in @entity49 , a city of about 175,000 people			0
a second teen , @entity79 , 18 , was initially charged with murder , but a judge reduced the charge to simple assault because @entity79 was not believed to be driving the vehicle used to kill @entity20			1
however , @entity18 prosecutors have said they plan to seek indictments against @entity79 for murder and a hate crime , and will seek indictments against other teens who were at the scene			1
the district attorney 's office has not officially commented on the family 's request for no death penalty in the case			0
last week , the @entity20 family filed a wrongful death suit against all seven of the white teens alleged to have been present at the beating of @entity20 that immediately preceded him being run over by the truck			1
the @entity103 , a nationally recognized organization based in @entity104 , @entity105 , that opposes racism and intolerance , joined the lawsuit			0
in addition to @entity11 and @entity79 , the lawsuit names five other teens as taking part in the incident : @entity114 of @entity115 ; @entity116 ; and @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 , all of @entity12			2
none of the five has been arrested or charged			0
@entity20 , a line worker at a @entity123 plant , sang in his church choir , according to the family 's attorney , @entity127 leaves behind his partner of 17 years			1
attorneys for @entity11 and @entity79 have not responded to requests for comment from @entity0			0
during a recent bond hearing , @entity11 's attorney told the court he saw nothing to back up the " racial allegations			0
" a civil trial can proceed at the same time as a criminal case , but often the civil case is delayed pending the resolution of a criminal trial			0
while a criminal case is pending , a defendant in a civil case may need to invoke the @entity145			0
authorities believe @entity11 led and instigated the attack , which took place after a night of drinking in largely white @entity149 , outside @entity49			2
the gang of teens climbed into @entity11 's green truck and a white suv and drove 16 miles to the western edge of @entity49			1
they would have seen @entity20 immediately as they exited the highway , officials said			0
he was standing in a hotel parking lot just beyond the exit ramp			0
on the videotape obtained exclusively by @entity0 , the group of teens is seen pulling into the parking lot and stopping where @entity20 is standing , although he is just off camera and not visible			1
the teens can then be seen going back and forth between their cars and @entity20			2
witnesses told authorities this is when @entity20 's beating took place , as the teens yelled racial epithets , including " white power			1
" authorities allege @entity11 and many of the other teens pummeled @entity20 repeatedly as he crumpled to the ground , although this is not visible on the tape			1
after the beating , some of the teens left and others got into the green @entity184 truck			0
at this moment , @entity20 becomes visible on the tape as he staggers into view and walks toward the truck			2
" @entity188 drove the @entity189 out of the parking lot and turned right onto @entity191 , " the lawsuit says			0
" just as @entity11 turned right , his headlights shone directly on @entity20 , who , having been severely beaten , was stumbling in a grassy area near the motel 's entrance			1
@entity11 accelerated , drove onto and over the street curb , and struck @entity20 with the front of the @entity189			1
" shortly afterward , @entity11 allegedly boasted and laughed about the killing , according to statements some of the teens made to detectives			1
" i ran that n --- -- over , " he allegedly said in a phone conversation to the teens in the other car			0
the proceedings of the case are taking place in the @entity18 courthouse , where in 1994 @entity210 was convicted in the notorious killing of civil rights leader @entity212 in 1963			0
@entity214 's @entity213 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
