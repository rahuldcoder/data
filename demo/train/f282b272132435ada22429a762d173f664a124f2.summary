? ride a one - man submersible to the deepest known point in the world 's oceans , before attempting to expand the @entity12 's resource base by backing a new space venture			2
@entity18 , known for writing and directing films like " @entity20 , " " @entity21 , " @entity22 , " has made headlines recently for some science ( non ) fiction projects that wo n't be appearing on the big screen			1
last month the filmmaker plunged more than 35,800 feet to the @entity24 , where he collected samples that will allow scientists to conduct research about the habitat			1
and now he 's apparently involved with @entity29 , along with several other distinguished investors			2
" [ @entity18 ] has more money than you could spend in 100 lifetimes , a lovely wife and family , a huge compound ... a lot of @entity42 , " said @entity31 , a longtime @entity32 publicist and the vice chairman of @entity34			1
" [ he 's ] made the two biggest movies in the entire world			2
after that , it kind of becomes about your dreams			2
it 's wonderful that somebody with these resources follows their dreams			2
" wealthy celebrities like @entity18 have the resources to boldly go where other people have only imagined			1
but there 's more to living out such dreams than a bottomless bank account			2
" ( @entity18 ) has the infrastructure to carry this out , " @entity31 told @entity0			1
" same as someone like ( sir @entity61			0
we 're not just talking about money here			0
" @entity61 , the business tycoon behind the @entity64 , has used his notoriety and wealth to break several world records and purchase land ( including a small island in the @entity70 ) , in addition to his many humanitarian initiatives			0
@entity73 is another celebrity who has been fortunate enough to follow her dreams			0
she opened the @entity75 in 2007			0
@entity73 visited @entity76 in january to congratulate the school 's first graduates			0
there are plenty of people with money who would n't be able to accomplish everything these celebs have accomplished or live out their dreams like @entity18 has , @entity31 said			1
" both ( @entity18 and @entity61 ) are in industries that generate a lot of press , " @entity31 said			1
" they 're both incredibly successful			0
if some @entity91 billionaire did it , it would n't get the same attention			1
but when @entity18 does it , it 's fascinating			1
and it might turn into a tv show			0
... knowing him , he 'll probably figure out a way to make money off [ his underwater exploration ]			1
that 's what a great businessman does			0
" " the thing about @entity18 is , he can get his mind around a project the size of ' avatar ' and keep his cool , " @entity106 wrote in 2009			1
" if it requires the development of untested technology , he takes the time to work on it			0
if he wants to create aliens human enough to be sexy and yet keep them out of the @entity119 ( the repulsion humans feel when robots look a little too realistic ) , he test - drives them			2
" @entity18 is somehow able to create worlds that do n't exist , and explain real events in a way that no one else can , @entity31 said			1
his curiosity and his unlimited resources allow him to do this			0
" and good for him and good for us who get to share in it , " he added			0
" we 're seeing places we 've never seen before [ because of him ] " -- both on and off screen .			0
