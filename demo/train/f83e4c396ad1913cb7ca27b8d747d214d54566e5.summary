-- more than 1,600 people within a 10 - mile stretch of central @entity6 's @entity5 beaches have been stung in the past week by a distinctive species of jellyfish not indigenous to @entity9 , a rescue official said tuesday			1
@entity11 officials said they began flying warning flags at beaches from @entity14 to @entity15 last tuesday , indicating either a medium or high hazard , along with another flag indicating dangerous marine life			1
" from last wednesday to friday , we got about 600 reports			2
saturday to ( tuesday ) , we got another thousand , " chief @entity20 said			2
@entity21 , a scientist at @entity23 's @entity22 , said the jellyfish appear to be what are known as mauve stingers , a species that often blooms in response to small climate cycles like @entity30			1
" the interesting thing about these jellyfish is that they 're very sporadic			1
they occur in heavy numbers , but not every year , " he said			2
@entity21 said the last time he had seen such a widespread outbreak in the @entity38 was more than a decade ago			2
" they 're much more common in the @entity40 , " he said			0
" probably what we 're seeing is a large population bloom in the @entity44 transported by the @entity45 wrapping around the coast of @entity6			1
" all weekend long , countless numbers of jellyfish washed up on shores , standing out against the sand due to their characteristic purplish - reddish hue			1
@entity21 said that although mauve stingers are smaller and much less familiar than the @entity55 man o ' war and cannonball jellyfish that often wash up on @entity6 shores , the ruddy - colored animal can pack a punch			1
" while they might be small , they 're actually pretty potent			1
and unlike the others , these animals actually have stinging cells up on the top of their bells in addition to the stingers on their tentacles , which is uncommon			0
" when stung , mauve stinger victims may see a discoloration on their skin where contact was made , @entity21 said			1
" these guys will leave actual marks on you sometimes			0
it may stay with you for quite some time , but over time it will go away			0
" the stings cause itching , burning and rashes and can sometimes spur an allergic reaction			0
although none of the stings reported in @entity11 was believed to be serious , officials said two people who were stung were taken to hospitals after suffering from respiratory distress			1
it was unclear whether the distress was directly caused by the stings or came from a pre-existing medical condition			0
most victims were being treated by a vinegar solution stocked at the various lifeguard stations			0
despite the abundance of visible jellyfish in the water , many trying to enjoy the @entity96 weekend took their chances -- and suffered the repercussions			2
" we 've already gone through about 25 gallons of vinegar			0
even so , a lot of people did n't go into the water , " @entity20 said			0
" i just want to know when they 're going to leave			0

the jellyfish are *visitors* to central @entity6 's @entity5 beaches
they *congregated* in a 10 - mile stretch off the coast of @entity11
the mauve stinger jellyfish are small but " pretty potent , " scientist says
