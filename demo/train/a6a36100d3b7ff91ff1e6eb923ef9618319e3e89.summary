@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's football team did not make it to the @entity5 this year , but that does not mean the country 's presence has not been felt : the @entity10 giant has cornered the market on perhaps the most unforgettable off - field aspect of the @entity5 -- the vuvuzela			1
ninety percent of the vuvuzelas , the plastic @entity16 trumpet whose loud rasp has become synonymous with the @entity19 , are made in @entity1 , according to the @entity20			1
the @entity1 did it the same way they have done for so many other products : low costs and quick production at factories like the one run by @entity27 just outside the southern @entity1 city of @entity0			1
with a few dozen staff , they make more than 20,000 bugles a day			2
so far this year , they have churned out more than 1 million of them			2
" i 'm very proud that our vuvuzelas made it to @entity5 in @entity16 , especially since we have such a small family factory , " @entity27 said			1
and she is not alone			0
a recent poll in the state media found that more than 60 percent of respondents were proud the " made in @entity1 " vuvuzelas were so popular in @entity16			1
making the trumpets is simple : plastic is melted into a mold and then it sets			1
a small group of women take off the sharp edges to finish off the process			0
@entity27 said it costs about us $ 0.40 to make each vuvuzela			0
but outside the stadiums in @entity53 , the vuvuzelas can sell for up to $ 8			2
despite the markup , not much is coming back to the @entity1 manufacturers			1
@entity27 said she makes just a few cents on each one			0
" although we do n't make a lot of money , i 'm sure we 'll have a good future making these , " she said			0
that 's because @entity27 and all the vuvuzela makers in @entity1 are looking beyond the @entity5			2
domestic orders are starting to come in , including for the @entity64 in @entity65 later this year			1
@entity27 is hoping that the vuvuzela will be the next must have accessory for all sports fans -- maybe the next giant foam finger -- at events like baseball , basketball or rugby			0
while a lot of debate has centered on the loud and droning noise of the vuvuzela , @entity27 has the tact of a business person who knows where the sales are			0
" the vuvuzela is a tradition in @entity16 , it makes a happy sound , " she said .			0
