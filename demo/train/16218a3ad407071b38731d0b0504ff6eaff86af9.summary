@entity1 's tactics in @entity2 are difficult to pin down : the @entity3 categorically denies @entity1 troops are fighting alongside rebels there , or that the sophisticated weaponry being used against @entity2 government forces is supplied by @entity8			1
in fact , there 's mounting evidence of both			0
@entity13 has released compelling satellite imagery -- dismissed by @entity8 -- purporting to show @entity1 forces crossing the @entity2 border			1
last week , the @entity2 military even captured 10 @entity1 paratroopers inside @entity2			1
the @entity3 said the troops had accidentally crossed from @entity1 while patrolling the long , porous border that separates the 2 former @entity22 states			1
but while questions about @entity1 's tactics remain , its strategy has become more clear : the @entity3 appears to have decided to prevent @entity2 turning @entity26 and leaving what @entity1 regards as its sphere of influence			1
that means denying @entity2 membership of @entity32 institutions like the @entity33 , and @entity13			2
what 's more , the @entity3 appears determined to achieve its goal regardless of the cost			0
international sanctions imposed on @entity1 so far have damaged the country 's economy , sending the @entity40 to all - time lows against the @entity43 dollar , but have had little impact on @entity3 policy			1
president @entity46 continues his support of the rebels in @entity2 , even increasing it , according to @entity32 officials			1
and he continues to enjoy soaring popularity , with approval ratings of well over 85 % , according to opinion polls			0
how to stop @entity46 and prevent a descent into all - out war , then , is the central question with which @entity32 officials are now grappling			1
there 's talk of further " costs and consequences " -- the words of president @entity61 -- but there 's division on what further sanctions can achieve			0
taking the @entity66 away from @entity1 , chosen to host the next event in 2018 , is being discussed and may send a powerful symbolic message of isolation to @entity8			1
but few expect it would force the @entity3 to change course			0

@entity13 , the @entity32 military alliance , is meeting this week in @entity77 and will examine what its response to @entity1 should be			2
ahead of the meeting there 's talk of increased military support for @entity2 , and that may yet be delivered ; but direct confrontation with a nuclear - armed @entity1 is regarded by member states , including the @entity33 , as a non-starter			1
it 's simply too risky			0
president @entity46 himself summed it up in a speech to a @entity93 youth camp outside @entity8 last week , voicing what many of his @entity32 counterparts may well be thinking			1
" it 's best not to mess with @entity1 , " he said			0
" let me remind you , we are a nuclear superpower			2
" that just leaves diplomacy , so often the last and best option			0
the good news is that the @entity1 and @entity2 presidents met last week for the first time since june			2
the bad news is that there was only an awkward handshake at the summit in @entity111 , and a refusal by either leader to compromise			0
@entity1 wants a ceasefire to freeze the conflict , and ultimately a federal constitution in @entity2 that would grant @entity1 language official status and @entity1 - speaking areas of the country greater autonomy			2
@entity2 rejects this , fearing it would mean losing effective control of its eastern provinces for good			0
that deadlock will simply have to be broken if this @entity2 crisis is going to end without further bloodshed or territorial losses			0
@entity33 officials say it 's still not too late for @entity1 to end the crisis without losing face			0
but with @entity8 so clearly digging in its heels , it may be the government in @entity134 and its @entity32 backers who , despite the bluster , will be looking to do a face - saving deal			2
