-- in 2005 , @entity1 was one of the rising stars of @entity4 tennis			1
aged just 20 , he recorded a shock win over world no. 9 @entity6 at the @entity8			1
despite being beaten in the second round , the future looked bright for the @entity12 native			2
however , it was to be his last match at a grand slam tournament for seven years as a nightmare series of injuries and operations threatened to end his promising career			1
" i was the no. 2 - ranked junior in the world , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity21			1
" i was hoping to start off with a bang on the @entity24 and have a successful career , whether top 50 , top 10 or top 20			2
" instead , he had to have five surgeries in four years			0
and until recently , his only involvement in tennis was playing on the low - ranking @entity31 and coaching his college team			1
@entity33 exits early at @entity34 as well as elbow and hernia injuries , the root of @entity1 's fitness problems lie with a hip condition which has troubled him since he was a boy			1
" @entity42 is a developmental condition that has to do with the way his hip formed when he was probably nine or 10 years old , " doctor @entity41 told @entity0			2
" there 's an overgrowth around the socket where the femoral head grows out , sort of like the front end of your car being a little out of alignment			0
it leads to some uneven wear inside the hip			2
" what 's remarkable to me he was able to reach such an elite status in the first place			0
he was spending as much time battling his hips as he was his opponent			0
" but now @entity1 is back on the big stage , having made a remarkable comeback			1
on wednesday , the 27 - year - old will play in the second round of a grand slam for the second time in his career			1
learn more about @entity1 's next @entity34 opponent having been awarded a wildcard entry to the @entity34 after winning a challenger tournament in april , @entity1 reached his first @entity24 final at a warmup event in @entity76 last weekend			1
he lost that match , but won his opener at @entity34 on monday against the man who beat him in @entity80 in 2005 , @entity82 's world no. 77 @entity79			1
@entity1 next faces a much tougher test against @entity86 11th seed @entity84 , but his family are just glad to see him back out on the court enjoying himself			1
" i was just so happy for him because that 's what he 'd worked all this time to go back for , " said his father @entity89			0
" now that he 's done that we hope to have a good time in @entity96			0
" we 've watched him play in grand slam matches before ; it 's not the first time			1
i always thought i would one day go to see him play in @entity34			1
" the famous clay - court venue holds special memories for @entity1 , who reached the 2003 @entity34 boys ' final before losing to @entity106 's @entity105 -- who has since enjoyed a steady career and is ranked 21st in the world			1
while players such as @entity111 and @entity112 -- both of whom he beat during that @entity34 run -- were winning titles and climbing the rankings , @entity1 was trying to rescue his fading career			1
" i think @entity117 beat me a couple of times , but i got the better of him a few more times , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" that was right when i was coming back from my first hip surgery			2
" i had no idea i was going to have four more surgeries ... i ca n't remember who he beat , ( @entity128 ) @entity127 and somebody else			2
it definitely gave me some motivation -- maybe if i come back i could have some good results			0
" @entity1 's return gained real momentum in @entity76			1
before losing to defending champion @entity135 in the final , he scored notable wins over former junior rival and world no. 14 @entity140 and @entity143 's former no. 3 @entity141 , a 21 - time title winner on the @entity24			2
" every time you go onto court you want to win , " @entity1 told the @entity24 's official website after his final defeat			1
" i am a competitor , i hate losing			0
but , when you look at the week as a whole , it has been an unbelievable week			0
" i hoped to qualify at the start of the week and win a match or two before going to @entity34			2
i obviously did much better			0
" i think even in the qualifying , i felt as if i was playing pretty well			0
i won my three matches easily and knew i was playing good tennis			0
" @entity1 's compatriot @entity159 , ranked 11th in the world , is pleased to see his former junior rival back competing at the highest level			2
" we are virtually the exact same age , " @entity159 told @entity0			0
" we were born days apart in and played in the juniors , he was hands down one of the best players in the country			0
" he definitely deserves it and he has worked really hard			0
and he has n't let all of these obstacles discourage him			0
" he is still doing what he loves and that is playing tennis -- and he is doing very well			0
you know , without more injuries and if he can stay healthy , i can see him in the top 100			0
