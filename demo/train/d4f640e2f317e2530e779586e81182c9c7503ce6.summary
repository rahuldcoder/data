back at @entity131 is rehearsing the carefully chosen @entity13 songs that will go on her album			1

" which is also yourself , how you think about the music and find which keys are correct			0
" one piece she is particularly inspired by is a poem made famous by @entity145 -- " @entity146 , " by @entity147			0
