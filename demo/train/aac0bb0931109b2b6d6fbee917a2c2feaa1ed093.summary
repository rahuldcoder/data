@entity0 , @entity1 -- life in this embattled country 's second - largest city appeared calm tuesday even as concerns over the plight of refugees grew			1
the calm came as the @entity12 nation 's news agency @entity10 reported that the death toll had risen to 176 , a number that some observers discounted as low			1
a team of @entity18 doctors who visited @entity21 's main hospital estimated the death toll at " several hundred			1
" the streets of the southern city of @entity0 appeared deserted , except for a few pedestrians and army checkpoints			2
stores , warehouses and shops were burned along miles of streets , which were patrolled armed police and soldiers			2
near the airport , the most dangerous part of town , no one could be seen on the streets , which were quiet except for the sounds of sporadic gunfire			2
in @entity21 , about an hour away , journalist @entity39 accompanied @entity1 military through the streets tuesday evening and told @entity2 that the military appeared to have imposed total control in the downtown area			1
explainer : @entity1 's ethnic unrest but , in the outskirts of town , sporadic gunfire and impromptu " checkpoints " continued , he said			1
about two - thirds of the downtown area had been looted and / or burned , with @entity53 - owned buildings appearing to have been the primary targets , he said			1
buildings marked " @entity1 " appeared undamaged , he said			1
in recent days , more than 100,000 ethnic @entity53 have fled the clashes with ethnic @entity1 , streaming into camps in neighboring @entity53 , according to @entity53 's @entity58			1
thousands more have been denied passage into @entity53 because of a lack of resources			1
many were standing on the @entity1 side of a barbed - wire fence			1
three border crossings between @entity1 and @entity53 were open , @entity53 's @entity58 said			1
one , at @entity66 , @entity53 , remained closed			1
the closure came after throngs of people fleeing the violence overwhelmed refugee camps in @entity53			1
working together , the @entity72 and the @entity18 of @entity1 have helped 16 medical facilities caring for more than 1,130 injured people in the past week , the @entity72 said in a statement			1
police said 15 officers have been killed			2
the @entity79 and @entity80 have evacuated 89 people -- including 31 @entity79 and 40 @entity82 -- from @entity0 , the @entity78 said tuesday			0
they were taken to the capital , @entity84 , in the north			0
the @entity79 is providing humanitarian assistance to the impoverished country and evaluating what further help may be needed , including military , a senior @entity79 health official said in @entity92			0
" right now our focus is humanitarian but it remains to be seen exactly what , if any , security assistance @entity1 needs , " said the official , who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue			1
the official said the @entity79 is not considering acting alone to provide any security assistance			0
the @entity79 military said the interim @entity1 government has presented an official request for aid from the @entity79 government beyond the $ 800,000 in humanitarian assistance already provided			1
@entity79 officials were working with the provisional government to determine how best to distribute another $ 200,000 in medical and emergency supplies			0
the clashes are part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former @entity117 republic since 1990 , when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between @entity53 and @entity1 in @entity0			1
it was not clear what sparked the violence , which came weeks after bloody protests removed @entity1 president @entity124 from office			2
but it was clear that tuesday 's calm did not indicate an end to the crisis			0
" this is far from over , " said @entity130 , a spokeswoman for the @entity72 , in a telephone call with @entity2 from @entity132 , @entity133			0
" it 's still extremely volatile			0
the needs are still extremely great			0
" those @entity53 who are most vulnerable are those who have had to remain in @entity1 , many of whom include orphans and the elderly , she said			1
for some , the situation is dire			0
" orphanages are running out of food , " she said			0
mosques and hospitals in @entity21 are receiving large numbers of burn victims and people with gunshot wounds , she said			0
on @entity53 's side of the border , refugees were seeking shelter in parking lots and abandoned buildings , the @entity72 said			2
as demand for water outpaced supply , some refugees were drinking from irrigation ditches , raising concern about outbreaks of diarrhea			2
some analysts have said the clashes stem from resentment from minority @entity53 that they have been under - represented in government positions and fears from ethnic @entity1 that @entity53 in the country will help @entity53 invade @entity1			1
refugees were seeking help at bleak camps on the @entity1 border with @entity53			1
" people are screaming , ' we need food ; we need food , ' to those who are passing by , " @entity177 commissioner @entity176 said			0
but in the refugee camp in @entity185 , there were ample supplies of food , tents , beds , sheets and blankets			0
the vast majority of the camp 's occupants were female			0
they said the males had largely stayed behind to look after their homes			0
the @entity198 said it was sending an emergency team to @entity53 to aid refugees who had crossed the border			2
@entity203 president @entity202 said the group condemns the " continued acts of violence in the @entity1 and notes the need to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance			2
" he said the council was assessing the situation in @entity1 and called for " calm and a return to the rule of law " in the country			2
in @entity0 , that calm did come tuesday			0
but some wondered how long it would last			0
" a pause before the unknown , and it 's not clear if dark or light is ahead , " said relief worker @entity219 said			0
@entity2 's @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
