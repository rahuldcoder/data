-- a 2005 cable by the @entity3 ambassador to @entity4 criticized how the southern @entity7 nation 's government handled the removal of @entity10 people from the @entity11 , according to the document obtained by @entity13 and published thursday by @entity16 's @entity15 newspaper			1
the cable by former ambassador @entity18 described a visit to the government - run @entity10 settlement called @entity22 outside the reserve where hundreds of @entity10 lived after being forced to leave the protected area			1
" it is also clear that people have been dumped in economically absolutely unviable situations without forethought , and without follow - up support , " said the cable bearing @entity18 ' name at the bottom			0
" the lack of imagination displayed on the part of the @entity35 ( government of @entity4 ) is breathtaking			0
" the @entity10 , traditional hunter - gatherers indigenous to arid regions of southern @entity7 including the desert interior of @entity4 , were forced out of the @entity11 by the government in 2002			1
the government said human inhabitants were out of place in a wilderness reserve , but the @entity10 and their advocates argued the government was clearing the way to launch the lucrative mining for diamonds , the country 's economic mainstay			1
on monday , @entity4 's government granted a 25 - year , $ 3 billion mining license to gem diamonds for an area that includes the part of the @entity11 , claimed as indigenous homeland by the @entity10			1
the cable , if authentic , does n't represent the current situation , @entity57 a spokesman for the @entity4 government , said in an e-mailed statement			2
" it is at best a snapshot of one individual 's own initial assessment at a point in time , " he said			0
@entity57 said the government has " engaged in a wide range of economic empowerment initiatives " for those affected by the relocation , including providing livestock , small business mentoring and other services			0
" it has been and remains @entity78 's view that the establishment of @entity22 has increased both the immediate and long - term opportunities for economic and social development of its residents , as is reflected in the village 's ongoing growth , " he said			0
in a separate but related matter , an appeals court in @entity4 will rule as soon as next week on whether @entity10 who have returned to the game reserve have the right to use a water well , known as a borehole , near their settlement			1
last year , justice @entity93 ruled against the @entity10 , saying they could choose to live closer to where water and other essential services were available outside the reserve			2
at an appeals court hearing this week , the lawyer for the @entity10 told the five appellate judges that the @entity10 had a lawful and constitutional right to live in the game reserve			1
in addition , the lawyer , barrister @entity103 , said the nation 's @entity105 allows any legal occupant of land to dig a borehole for domestic use			0
in response , the lawyer for the government told the appellate panel that the government was not obliged to restore resources for the @entity10 in the game reserve			1
the lawyer , @entity118 , said the government provided sufficient water to @entity10 communities outside the reserve			2
" the applicants have eschewed the government 's provision of services in favor of living traditionally in the " game reserve , @entity123 said			2
if the @entity10 chose to live a nomadic life like their ancestors , they should do so as their ancestors did , without government - provided water , he argued			0
according to @entity139 , a @entity16 - based group that advocates for the @entity10 , a 2006 court ruling gave the @entity10 the right to return to their ancestral land , but the government " has done everything it can to make their return impossible , " the group says on its website .			0
