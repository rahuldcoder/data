-- part of the power of social networking is the ability to form communities with like - minded individuals			1
attorney @entity7 is trying to get @entity8 to remove pages for holocaust denial groups such as this one			1
but what happens when those communities are offensive to others ? that issue is at the heart of attempts by a @entity19 , @entity20 , attorney to have social - networking site @entity8 remove pages for @entity24 deniers			1
the @entity26 movement seeks to deny or minimize the @entity24 , in which @entity27 killed about six million @entity28 during @entity29 attorney @entity7 , brother of @entity31 team owner @entity30 , has been trying since last year to have the pages of groups with such names as " holocaust : a @entity36 , " and " @entity24 is a @entity26 " removed from @entity8			1
he pointed out that @entity8 has removed groups based on complaints before and said the site is " setting the subjective standard on what they remove and what they do n't			1
" " there is no @entity46 right to free speech in the private realm , " @entity7 said			2
" this is n't a freedom - of - speech issue			2
@entity8 is free to set the standard that they wish			2
" @entity8 spokesman @entity52 said his company is in agreement with @entity7 that the holocaust - denial pages are offensive and objectionable			1
where the two sides part , @entity52 said , is whether people have the right to discuss such ideas on @entity8			1
" it 's a difficult decision to make			0
we have a lot of internal debate and we bring in experts to talk about it , " @entity52 said			0
" just being offensive or objectionable does n't get it taken off @entity8			1
we want it [ the site ] to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas , including controversial ones			2
" @entity52 said @entity8 has drawn the line with pages or groups that attack an individual or incite or threaten violence			1
@entity52 pointed to the recent removal of the " @entity81 " page , created by residents of the island off the coast of @entity86			0
@entity8 interpreted the page 's advocacy of " cleansing the island of foreigners " as threatening and inciting violence , he said			2
@entity8 receives lots of reports about such pages and actively polices the site , @entity52 said			1
last year @entity8 removed several pages posted by @entity98 neo-nazis after complaints that they encouraged violence against gypsies			1
@entity7 , who is of @entity104 @entity103 descent , has written about his fight to have the holocaust - denial pages removed on his site , the @entity108			1
he said he contacted @entity8 after a conversation with a friend who runs the @entity111 , a group that monitors and tries to eradicate anti-semitic online content			2
the @entity111 , which was successful in removing a @entity8 page for the group " @entity115 is not a country ! delist it from @entity8 as a country , " is outspoken in its own right and sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own			0
in an article on @entity7 's site published during the 2008 presidential campaign , a representative from the @entity111 was quoted as saying that " 99.9 percent of @entity126 hate us			2
" the article went on to quote @entity111 spokesman on the last presidential campaign : " we hope to continue to highlight the issues surrounding [ then - candidate @entity132 's ] terrorist connections as well as his racist and anti-semitic church , which has supported @entity135 and the rev. @entity136			0
" a @entity111 spokesperson named @entity138 , who requested his last name be withheld because his group has received death threats , said thursday he would rather people not focus on those specific quotes for several reasons , including the fact that it was an " informal interview " and @entity30 " would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline			0
" but on the matter of @entity8 and @entity24 deniers , the @entity111 has a clear stance			2
" @entity8 should not provide a platform for hatred , especially as it is against their @entity155 [ terms of service ] , " @entity138 said			0
" holocaust denial is illegal in 13 countries and represents a form of jew hatred and hate speech in general			0
" @entity162 is the @entity163 and holocaust studies at @entity165 and an expert on holocaust denial			0
she said social - networking sites like @entity8 are attractive to deniers			1
" it allows people to find one another , both for good and for bad , " she said			0
" people who are drawn to @entity24 denial tend to be fringe kind of people who might not otherwise be able to find a group , but this way they can find other like - minded people			1
" @entity180 , director of @entity181 for the @entity182 , said the issue of @entity184 and hate speech online is a growing one , partly because of the anonymity the @entity188 offers			0
@entity180 pointed out that @entity8 's @entity189 says that users " will not post content that is hateful , threatening , pornographic , or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence			0
" she said the @entity182 has worked with sites such as @entity196 and @entity197 to encourage them to be " socially responsible corporate citizens			0
" " even though in the @entity205 this kind of hate is protected speech , [ web sites ] do n't have to provide the forum to help spread it , " said @entity180 , whose organization is the @entity201 representative for the @entity202			0
" our position is that if you are going to be providing it , then you have to step up and put in the mechanism for policing it			0
