they reunited over the weekend for the first time since the @entity6 tore apart their family			1
@entity1 , his sister and @entity11 's son started crying immediately on seeing one another , said @entity11 's son , @entity13			1
the family took part in family reunions that began october 30 and will end friday at @entity18 , the two @entity19 ' joint mountain resort in the @entity20			1
many burst into tears at the reunions , which involve 100 people from each side			1
elderly men in suits and women in traditional @entity30 silk hanbok dresses sat at numbered tables in a large restaurant			1
some sat , spoke and exchanged photographs ; others simply looked bewildered as they clutched hands and stared into faces unseen for six decades			1
the relatives have been separated from since the 1950 - 53 @entity6			1
" after a while , my father said they need to stop crying and smile , so the memories of the meeting could be better			1
he said they should say goodbye smiling , not crying			1
it was hard to see that , " @entity13 said			1
@entity11 's father was n't immediately available for comment			1
" we were very happy to meet her and learn about how she had lived , " @entity13 said of his aunt			2
" i felt relieved to hear she had worked as a nurse and later became a doctor , that probably means she had a better life " than many @entity30			2
" still , it broke my hear to see her and think of the difficulties she might have gone through , " @entity11 said			2
" she told us that when the @entity20 family meetings started , she was upset that no one in her family had looked for her , " he said			2
" it was a shock for us to hear she felt that way , " @entity11 said			2
" we did our best to explain to her we thought she had died during the war and that we would have tried to look for her , had we known she was still out there			1
when she left , she said she understood , but i wondered what she really thought and how she really felt			1
" the elder @entity11 had not seen his sister since 1951 , when she was 15 years old			1
he was a police officer during the war and often was away from home			2
when he returned one day , " she was gone			2
i asked where she was and she had been kidnapped [ by @entity30 soldiers ]			2
after that , we did n't know where she was , " @entity11 said			2
" my mother was just waiting for her to get back			2
she could n't go out to look for her			2
even if she wanted , she did n't even know where she could search , " @entity11 added			0
" it was a vague hope			0
she wondered , will it be today ? will it be tomorrow ? she just waited			0
" @entity11 's wife , @entity95 , shared her memories of those traumatic years : " all the family was alive then			0
three generations lived at the house and people waited for her to come back			0
" " but time passed , we were n't able to think			0
there were shootings , bombs , the men went to the army			0
... i did n't even know if my husband was alive			0
" " life was hard then			0
that was how we lived then			0
my brother and my father were also gone			0
everything was taken from us			0
we did n't have food			0
" " there were bombs			0
it was not a proper life			0
we just tried to survive			0
after this , we thought she died			1
we could have never imagined she survived			0
" last year , the @entity125 got word through government channels that his sister was alive , in @entity30			1
no mail , telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the @entity30 border , so the siblings pinned their hopes on the government - sanctioned reunions			1
millions of @entity30 were divided by the war			1
it ended in a truce , but without a formal peace treaty			0
the prickly relationship between the countries has since had periodic conciliatory moves and flare - ups			0
some 80,000 @entity147 have registered with their government to join one of the infrequent reunions , but 40,000 people are thought to have passed away or given up hope , according to the @entity125 's @entity153			1
numbers are unknown in the secretive @entity20			0
