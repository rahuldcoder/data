-- feted as the most talented @entity3 player of his generation , whose tears after their semifinal exit of the @entity7 touched a global audience , @entity1 had it all			1
his working class background and precocious talent drew comparisons with @entity13 , but like the former @entity17 legend , who died in 2005 , the demons of alcohol addiction have taken an ominous toll			0
" alcoholic @entity1 has been experiencing a tough time of late , " said his management agency @entity21 in a statement released to @entity0 on tuesday			1
" he has been asking for help and has willingly been admitted to a treatment center in @entity25			0
he has complex issues that are currently being dealt with by professionals			1
" @entity1 has been extremely touched and overwhelmed by the generous offers of help and support over the past few days			1
he is motivated to fully understand and control his addiction problem under guidance			0
" since his playing career ended in 2004 , @entity1 's life has been on a downward spiral as he has battled both the bottle and compulsive disorders			1
the 45 - year - old has been sectioned three times under @entity41 's @entity40 and made regular trips to rehabilitation clinics			1
barely coherent each time has come promises of a new start , but the grip of addiction manifested itself again last week at a charity event in the @entity51 town of @entity52			0
barely coherent as he answered questions on stage , he broke down in tears in an appearance lasting less than 10 minutes			0
not for the first time , fears for @entity1 's well being were raised by friends and supporters , including @entity62 , a teammate for both @entity63 and @entity64			1
it was @entity62 , who famously signaled to the @entity63 bench in the semifinal against @entity68 at @entity7 after @entity1 had been yellow carded , meaning the heartbreak of missing the final should the team have made it			1
@entity1 's tears of frustration that day formed the basis of @entity76 's concern -- now nearly 23 years later , his fears are over a more serious matter			2
reacting to the latest sorry incident , @entity62 , a respected television presenter , tweeted : " lots of you asking for my thoughts on @entity84 's plight			2
i can only hope he finds peace somehow , but fear those hopes may be forlorn			0
" from outside the game , @entity0 's @entity87 was quick to lend his support to the fallen star			2
great support " anyone who knows @entity1 knows how desperate he is , and has been , to sort himself out			1
he deserves our sympathy , not ridicule			0
# @entity84 , " he wrote on his @entity96 feed			0
@entity62 and @entity87 were reported to have assisted to get @entity1 admitted to the specialist clinic in @entity98 , @entity99 to deal with his alcohol and related problems			1
another close friend , former @entity63 test cricketer @entity102 , helped to get @entity1 on a plane to the @entity25 , as he confirmed in an interview on national radio			1
" i had a chat with ( @entity109 radio dj ) @entity110 and he just asked how we could help him , " @entity102 told @entity106			0
" we knew we just had to get him on this flight , out to @entity98 , we just had to get him on the plane			0
" i called @entity113 and explained the situation , that we had to get him out to @entity98 to get him some help			0
he needs it , and if not , who knows what 's going to happen ? " @entity102 added : " it 's tough			0
mental health issues are a serious , serious subject			0
" but sadly he 's not been able to help himself			0
" so many people rang up yesterday to help @entity1 , like you could never believe , but the truth is he has n't been able to help himself			2
" @entity1 's precocious talent was first recognized by his local club @entity126 , though his troubled upbringing in an area of the north - east city noted for social deprivation , may well have been the basis for his troubled life			1
top talent but the midfielder 's talent on the pitch was undoubted , once taunting opponents by sitting on the ball in the middle of a hotly contested @entity3 top division match			0
turning down an offer from @entity142 's @entity17 , @entity1 signed for @entity64 and made his first of his 57 appearances for @entity63 shortly afterwards			1
then national manager @entity144 famously labeled him as " daft as as brush " because of his unpredictable and compulsive behavior , but had no complaints as @entity1 proved central to @entity63 's @entity7 success			1
@entity144 's predecessor @entity149 first flagged up a wider problem , referring to @entity1 's " refuelling " problems -- a clear reference to his liking for alcohol			1
when @entity156 , @entity1 's club manager at @entity64 , took over the @entity63 team , he had to cope with the infamous " @entity160 " incident in @entity159			1
supposedly preparing there for @entity162 , @entity1 and teammates were pictured in a bar sitting in a chair and having alcoholic drinks poured down their throats			2
after scoring a brilliant individual goal against @entity169 in the tournament , @entity1 lay prone on the @entity172 turf and allowed teammates to spray water in his mouth , mimicking the controversy			2
but eventually the jokes turned sour and off field problems and lack of fitness were cited when @entity180 left him out of @entity63 's squad for the @entity182			2
@entity1 reportedly smashed up his hotel room in response and at the same time was going through a very public divorce from his wife of two years @entity187			1
in two subsequent " bare it all " autobiographies , @entity1 admitted to once striking his wife during an argument , asking for forgiveness			1
fading career after spells at @entity195 in @entity196 and @entity169 's @entity197 , @entity1 saw out his career with @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , a @entity202 club @entity203 and lowly @entity204			2
since retiring , @entity1 has tried a career as a tv pundit , briefly coached a non-league side and played in a number of charity matches , still displaying his formidable skills			1
interspersed have been appearances in @entity41 courts for drunken driving and a drugs offense , but he has narrowly avoided serving a custodial sentence			0
his fall from grace mirrors that of @entity13 , who battled alcohol problems after his glittering career came to an early end			0
@entity221 's @entity13 died of complications arising from an earlier liver transplant eight years ago and @entity224 , the chief of the @entity225 ( @entity225 ) , is worried the same fate could befall @entity1			2
" we just do n't want this to be another @entity13 tragedy , " @entity149 told @entity109 national radio			0
" he does need a big support system , and he 's got it from lots of friends			0
but there is a frustration that when things look to be improving , it all goes off wire			0
" @entity149 also refuted suggestions that the @entity225 had not done enough to help @entity1 .			2
