-- they dedicate their lives to saving others , but as @entity5 spreads worldwide , health care workers must also focus on saving themselves			1
an @entity8 doctor and a @entity10 missionary working with @entity5 victims were the first to bring the deadly virus to the @entity8 when they contracted the virus in @entity15 and were flown home for treatment			1
now , a @entity19 nurse has set a similar milestone , becoming the first person known to have contracted the disease inside the @entity8 she was wearing the proscribed protective gear -- gloves , mask and shield -- while recently caring for @entity15 national @entity27 at a @entity19 hospital			1
while the @entity35 nurse remains in isolation , a nurse in @entity30 who contracted the virus after treating a patient in that country is struggling for her life			1
there are so many caregivers who 've become patients			1
at least 416 health care workers have contracted @entity5 , and at least 233 have died , the @entity41 reports			1
in @entity15 , the worst - affected country , the virus has killed more than 100 medical workers			1
since the @entity5 outbreak began -- the worst the world has seen -- doctors and nurses have described working conditions no one should endure			1
every single move they make in treating a patient must be perfect			2
one slip - up -- a torn glove or the smallest splat of infected fluid that gets on them -- could cost them their lives			0
one provider in @entity63 spoke of waking up every morning with a sore throat from constantly breathing in the fumes from chlorine that must be constantly sprayed to kill the virus that is capable of thriving not just in living organisms but on surfaces for some time if conditions are right			2
health care workers battle not just a disease but rumors among patients in @entity63 that @entity5 is a myth the government is perpetrating			1
in a profession that already demands much emotionally and physically , these caregivers are pushed to the edge in both respects			0
they have lost friends , colleagues and patients			0
all this as they beat back their own understandable paranoia and fear			0
have i done everything correctly ? could i be next ? caregivers ' cry for help last week , @entity91 , an independent international organization that helps victims of tragedies in the world 's most dangerous zones , said that a @entity97 staffer had contracted @entity5			1
the staffer had been working in the @entity99 city of @entity100 and was being sent to @entity101 for treatment			0
@entity91 said it 's repeatedly asked for help from the international community but " to this date , very little has materialized in concrete action on the ground , " its website says			0
the organization 's teams , composed of 3,058 staff working in @entity113 , @entity15 , @entity114 , @entity99 and @entity115 , are seeing " critical gaps in all aspects of the response , including medical care , training of health staff , infection control , contact tracing , epidemiological surveillance , alert and referral systems and community education and mobilization			1
" in september , @entity0 visited @entity129 , @entity15 , where there were only two doctors covering its 85,000 residents and trying to care for @entity5 patients in a 12 - bed facility that was n't even a proper ebola treatment center			1
a nurse inside a @entity138 clinic wore a camera showing his job , revealing that he worked inside a clinic with seemingly unclean conditions			1
patients were lying on stretchers on floors that appear filthy , and there were open buckets lying around with objects and substances in them			0
the situation for caregivers across @entity15 has become so dire that nurses are now are threatening to strike			1
just days ago , @entity0 's cameras captured crowds of caregivers yelling outside @entity15 's largest ebola treatment center in @entity138			1
underscoring the serious consequences of a @entity15 without health care workers , president @entity156 arrived to try to calm the crowd			1
" we 're trying to meet all their needs , and we 'll continue to do that , " she told @entity0 , struggling to be heard above the shouting			0
" i do n't want to strike , " one caregiver said , telling @entity0 that he foresees deaths increasing several thousand-fold if facilities ' conditions do n't improve			0
" but the president has to listen to the massive health care workers out there , " he said			1
" there are angry people			0
you do n't want to have angry people knocking on your doors during this kind of emergency situation			0
" this weekend , the @entity178 detailed horrific conditions at a @entity181 facility where one doctor died from @entity5 and another tested positive for the virus			1
the @entity178 reported : " doctors put on their protective gear in the kitchen			0
there is no incinerator , so a 10 - foot pile of @entity5 - laced garbage and excrement sits in the back yard			1
there is no morgue , so bodies sometimes decay outside , next to where patients sit in white lawn chairs			0
there are no protective hoods for the full - body medical suits , " so caregivers make their own			0
there have also been questions about how tight security is at health care centers			1
in august , @entity0 reported that an ebola treatment facility in @entity138 was overrun by an armed mob who stole mattresses and equipment			0
@entity5 patients fled , local authorities said			1
a legacy of self - sacrifice the mother of modern nursing , @entity215 , suffered for her dedication to treating patients during the @entity219			2
it 's believed that she also contracted a bacterial infection as she treated the wounded , dealing the effects of the illness for much of her life			0
just as @entity215 was revered as a hero , so too was dr. sheik @entity227 , a top doctor from @entity99 who specialized in @entity5			2
he died in late july from the virus			2
he had been overseeing @entity5 treatment at @entity230 , about 185 miles east of @entity99 's capital city , @entity232			2
if @entity227 could get sick , then any other caregiver could , wrote dr. @entity234 from @entity235 , who treated @entity5 patients this summer			1
read more : @entity5 's frontline -- battling fear and the deadly virus even before the @entity5 outbreak , @entity99 had already been suffering from a shortage of doctors , nurses and infrastructure , he said			1
the jobs of health care workers were made all the worse when they attempted to track and monitor the contacts of infected people because roads were difficult to traverse			1
crowded housing made the effort even more difficult , he said			0
yet even with the best medicine in the most modern facilities does not guarantee safety			0
the nurse at @entity256 in @entity19 who has @entity5 had " extensive contact " at the same hospital with an @entity5 patient who died last week , health officials said			1
the woman had on a gown , gloves , mask and a shield when she visited the patient multiple times , they said , but there was a breach in treatment protocol			0
dr. @entity270 , the director of @entity271 , did not detail what that breach might have been			0
but @entity270 did say that merely taking off protective gear is " a major potential area for risk " if not done meticulously , and officials are investigating whether that 's what might have caused the nurse to become infected			0
hours after @entity270 spoke , nurses who are part of the union @entity282 gathered in @entity283 , @entity284 , for their own news conference			0
holding up signs that said " stop blaming nurses			0
stop @entity5 , " they blasted the notion that they would be at fault			2
her voice rising as she spoke , @entity291 , a 20 - year nursing veteran , said that colleagues throughout the @entity8			2
have reported to the union that they are not being adequately trained to recognize and care for @entity5 patients even though they have asked employers for that			1
" they have not given us this information , " she said			0
enormous pressure and risks what does it feel like to know you 're going to treat a patient with a disease that kills 90 % of its victims ? what is it like to have never before dealt with @entity5 , but know that a patient is about to land in your hospital under your care ? " there was no way to fully prepare for the pressure , the national focus , the immensity of being responsible for curing a patient whose deadly disease was at the center of global debate , " wrote @entity316 in the @entity178			1
the infectious disease physician is an assistant medical director for the @entity328 at the @entity329 where she treated @entity8 dr. @entity330			2
@entity330 , who had worked as a missionary in @entity15 , was treated in isolation at the @entity329 in @entity333 and then released after testing negative for the virus			1
she wrote about going through drills and training and about feeling nervous before he arrived			0
she talked with her family about what they might experience from people judging or making comments born of ignorance and fear about the virus			2
she also illuminated the difference between a doctor who able to connect and comfort a patient through touch by placing a hand on an arm			0
establishing that calm and assurance is a vital and human part of being a caregiver			0
but @entity5 takes that from nurses and doctors			2
it is interrupted by bulky gear			0
the key to not getting @entity5 , after all , is to keep those suffering separate from others			2
and yet nurses and doctors continue their work out of practical necessity and because it 's their commitment and passion and because , as @entity316 noted , they are fascinated by how medicine might defeat a virus that 's considered a global threat			0
and for some in @entity63 , it really is a matter of survival			0
" what 's else can we do ? if we do n't do it , who will do it for us ? " one @entity15 nurse told @entity0			1
" so we have to take the risk and care for the patients or else our country will be wiped away			2
