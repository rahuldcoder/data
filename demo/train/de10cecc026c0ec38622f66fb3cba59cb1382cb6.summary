-- @entity1 on monday announced a " premiere " event set for next month in @entity3 , along with a set of cryptic images suggesting new devices for its @entity8 and @entity9 - based lines			1
the event is set for thursday , june 20 , at the @entity13 exhibition center in @entity3			1
the announcement specifically mentions the @entity18 electronics maker 's @entity8 and @entity16 lines			1
@entity8 is the company 's trademark line of @entity22 - based mobile products -- chief among them the @entity25 smartphone , which has emerged as the chief rival to @entity28 's @entity27			1
it also includes the @entity30 tablets and the @entity32 phone			0
@entity16 is the company 's lesser - known @entity9 line			2
the line includes tablets and laptops , but with a focus on mobile , the event could include the launch of a new smartphone running @entity44 's operating system			2
@entity1 's @entity46 phone was unveiled last year and was one of the first devices designed to run the @entity50 operating system			0
its hardware is similar to the popular @entity52 , but the phone failed to make much of an impression on buyers			0
so far , only @entity56 has had much luck capturing sales in the relatively slender portion of the smartphone market owned by @entity44			0
( but analysts say @entity63 devices have moved into third place in the market , passing @entity66 while still trailing @entity22 and @entity28 by a wide margin			0
) the @entity1 event announcement suggests there may be three devices introduced			0
it features three stylized images that appear to be closeups of parts of sleek , shiny electronic gadgets			0
supply - line leaks , and what appeared to be an accidental post on @entity1 's apps page , suggest that a smaller @entity25 smartphone might be one of them			1
a @entity84 site posted images of what appear to be two @entity25 's side - by - side , with one visibly smaller than the other			2
unconfirmed reports have suggested the " @entity91 " would have a 4.3 - inch screen , compared to the 5 - inch screen on the phone released earlier this year			0
on june 20 , the @entity1 event will fall between @entity28 's @entity96 developers conference , which runs june 10 - 14 , and @entity44 's own developers conference , build , which begins june 26			1
the event will be broadcast live on @entity1 's @entity100 account , beginning at 6 p.m. @entity3 time ( 1 p.m. et ) .			1
