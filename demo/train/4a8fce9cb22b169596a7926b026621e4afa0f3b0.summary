president @entity0 says his feelings are n't hurt by @entity2 who do n't want to campaign side - by - side with him because those candidates are " strong allies and supporters of me " when casting votes in @entity8			1
" the bottom line is , though , these are all folks who vote with me			2
they have supported my agenda in @entity8 , " @entity0 said on @entity16 's radio show monday , ticking off measures like a minimum wage increase , equal pay , investments in infrastructure and early childhood education			1
" so , this is n't about my feelings being hurt , " he said			0
" these are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me			0
and i tell them , i said , ' you know what , you do what you need to win			0
i will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn up			0
' " his comments were similar to ones he made at @entity36 earlier this month -- which republicans immediately plugged into campaign ads. those comments , former @entity41 adviser @entity40 said , were a political mistake			2
@entity0 's remarks could harm endangered red - state @entity2 and offer a boost to @entity37 who need to capture six seats to gain control of the @entity48 for the president 's final two years in office .			1
