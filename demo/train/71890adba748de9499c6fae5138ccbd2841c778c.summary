-- the former @entity3 assistant football coach currently awaiting trial on child sex assault charges can visit with some of his grandchildren , a judge ruled monday			1
the decision by judge @entity8 eases some conditions of @entity11 's house arrest , which had forbidden contact with his 11 grandchildren			1
@entity14 , @entity11 's attorney , said the former assistant coach and his family are happy about the ruling			1
" @entity11 , @entity19 , and their entire family are very relieved by and pleased with the court 's decision , " @entity14 said in a written statement			1
@entity11 will be allowed to visit with eight of his grandchildren under parental supervision , @entity8 ruled			0
but another judge in a custody case involving the other three grandchildren should decide whether @entity11 can visit with them , @entity8 ruled			2
the mother of those children has strongly objected to them having contact with @entity11			0
state attorney general @entity32 had blasted @entity11 's request to see his grandchildren , saying in a motion earlier this month that @entity11 was fortunate to be granted house arrest when " he is alleged to have committed 52 sexual offenses			1
" @entity32 also argued that @entity11 should be required to stay indoors during his house arrest because of fears among neighbors and teachers at a nearby elementary school			1
@entity8 denied that request monday , ruling that prosecutors did not present any evidence showing that @entity11 had tried to contact children at the school			2
the state " failed to present any evidence whatsoever that ( @entity11 ) presents a clearly defined threat to any student at the adjoining elementary school simply by being on his deck , " monday 's the ruling says			2
@entity8 also ruled monday that @entity11 would be allowed to have visits from adult friends and to leave his home for meetings with attorneys and private investigators aiding in his defense , provided that a probation coordinator approves			0
" @entity11 is also happy he can now have visitation with long - time friends with the prior approval of the @entity67 and will be able to continue to use the deck to his home to exercise , care for and supervise his dog , @entity71 , when @entity71 is in the yard , " @entity14 said in his statement issued after monday 's ruling			1
@entity11 has been under house arrest since december , when he was charged with sexually abusing young boys over a 15 - year period			0
he has pleaded not guilty to the charges			0
@entity8 has said he is aiming for a may 14 trial for @entity11			0
on monday , the judge denied a prosecution request that jurors be selected from outside the county where the former coach is being prosecuted			0
the allegations against @entity11 led to the firing of @entity3 's heralded head football coach @entity85 only months before he died of complications from lung cancer			2
@entity88 , @entity3 's former athletic director , and @entity90 , a former university vice president who oversaw campus police , have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged 2002 sexual assault of a child			2
both of them have pleaded not guilty			0
on monday an attorney requested that the perjury charge against @entity88 be dropped , arguing that @entity85 's death means prosecutors no longer have a required second witness to support the charge			1
@entity0 's @entity103 and @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
