@entity0 -- @entity3 chairman @entity2 gave voice wednesday to the mistrust between his party and president @entity7 after the president said he was " not going to just wait " on republicans to pass comprehensive immigration reform			1
" i do n't believe a thing he says , " @entity2 said wednesday , when asked by @entity1 's @entity11 about working with the president			1
" all he 's been doing for the last year is lying to @entity15 voters across the country			0
" while both parties said wednesday that they hoped to find common ground , they also signaled imminent conflict			0
@entity7 made it clear that he was still planning to pursue executive action on immigration reform this year			2
the expected next senate majority leader @entity24 and @entity26 speaker @entity25 penned an op - ed in the @entity28 on wednesday laying out their agenda for the next two years -- which includes repealing @entity7 's signature health care law			1
and @entity2 also questioned why @entity31 should compromise with @entity7			1
" after the @entity33 people repudiated the policies of @entity7 and everyone that was connected to him , to now say ' well , what are you guys going to do to compromise with the person the @entity33 people had just repudiated ? ' i think it 's a little bizarre , " @entity2 said			1
in an editorial entitled " now we can get @entity55 going , " @entity25 and @entity43 spent most of their ink touting their legislative agenda and the chance to pass bills that majority leader @entity51 has kept off the @entity53 floor			1
the @entity3 leaders pledged to pass legislation to repeal @entity58 and authorize the @entity60 pipeline -- both measures @entity62 have ardently opposed			2
@entity51 spokesman @entity63 fired back in an email thursday accusing @entity43 of " letting @entity67 [ @entity66 ] @entity65 set the agenda " by vowing to repeal @entity58 and pointed out that the word " compromise " was " conspicuously absent from senator @entity43 's vision for the next @entity55			2
" and after slamming democrats for keeping bills from getting a vote , the pair signaled that @entity3 control of @entity55 will herald a new era of more inclusive governance			0
" we will restore an era in which committees in both the @entity26 and @entity53 conduct meaningful oversight of federal agencies and develop and debate legislation ; and where members of the minority party in both chambers are given the opportunity to participate in the process of governing , " @entity43 and @entity25 wrote			1
the top two republicans in @entity55 also left a key item off their agenda in the editorial : immigration reform			0
the two sides continued to butt heads over the issue on wednesday			0
@entity43 said during a press conference wednesday that executive action from @entity7 would be a " mistake " and would " poison the well			1
" @entity43 also said there " certainly are going to be areas of disagreement " and said @entity7 " has really got a choice			2
" that choice should be to " give the new @entity55 a chance " on immigration reform , said sen. @entity109 , who is considered by many to be the linchpin of any comprehensive deal on immigration			0
" ' at the end of the day the @entity31 would benefit from getting immigration reform off the table , " @entity109 said wednesday on @entity1			0
@entity109 was one of tuesday night 's victors who got a call from @entity7			0
and @entity109 said he told the president to be patient , but also challenged the @entity31 on immigration reform .			0

@entity3 chairman @entity2 said wednesday he does n't ' believe a thing ' @entity7 says
this comes despite *initial* *bipartisan* *overtures* on both sides
but a @entity43 - @entity25 editorial laid out a partisan agenda
