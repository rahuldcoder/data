@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 heavyweight @entity3 kept up his vigorous defense against corruption charges friday in @entity1 's most politically sensitive trial in decades			1
@entity3 's glittering career , in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies , fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder , betrayal and financial skullduggery			1
his high profile and connections among the nation 's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for @entity1 authorities			1
it 's taken more than a year , during which time the @entity4 underwent a major leadership change , to bring him to trial			2
timeline : @entity3 's fall from grace many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a preplanned script , seeing the trial 's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between @entity3 and @entity1 's top leaders			1
but as he often did in his political career , @entity3 has so far stolen the show , mounting a robust attack on the prosecution 's case and ridiculing witnesses ' testimony			1
that has left @entity1 watchers trying to figure out how far he 's veered off script			2
@entity3 calls wife ' insane ' he began his counterattack after the trial opened thursday amid tight security in the eastern city of @entity0			1
he said he had made an earlier confession to party investigators " unwillingly " and described testimony by a former associate as " an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul			2
" he continued his offensive friday , calling his imprisoned wife " insane " after the court was shown video testimony in which she implicated him in a murky property deal in the @entity69			1
@entity3 , 64 , is on trial on charges of bribery , embezzlement and abuse of power			1
journalists from the international news media have n't been allowed inside the courtroom			0
but the court 's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside , attracting more than 350,000 followers on @entity83 , @entity1 's @entity84 - like service			1
@entity2 has n't been able to verify precisely how accurate and comprehensive the court 's version of proceedings has been			1
but many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close , albeit filtered , account			0
@entity91 adjourned for the day friday and will resume at 8:30 a.m. saturday			1
an ' eloquent ' defense " in my view , @entity3 has decided not to cooperate , but not completely			1
because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems , " said @entity95 , a @entity1 expert at the @entity96			0
the prosecutors were " terrible , " @entity95 said , while @entity3 was " clear , focused , articulate and eloquent			2
" his courtroom display appears to have been striking enough to prompt a personal attack against him on the website of the @entity103 , the official @entity4 newspaper			0
" @entity3 's righteous and forceful performance in court makes one marvel at his superb acting and lying skills , " the op - ed article said , citing an unidentified " media personality who attended the trial			1
" " his cunning arguments are only going to prove his extremely poor character and not going to help him evade punishment under law , " the article quoted the person as saying			0
conviction still seen as likely although the effectiveness of @entity3 's performance so far does n't mean the court will acquit him , it may make it tougher for it to mete out a heavy sentence			1
the conviction rate for criminal trials and their appeals in @entity1 -- where the party controls police , prosecution and courts -- stood at 99.9 % in 2010 , a @entity127 report cited the @entity91 as saying			0
" of course he will be convicted , otherwise it would be disastrous , " @entity95 said			0
" but the sentencing now ca n't be very severe because of the nature of the charge and how poorly they 've conducted this trial			0
" it remains to be seen if the prosecutors ' performance improves as the case continues			0
@entity1 leaves nothing to chance for @entity3 ' trial of the century ' flaws revealed much of the fallout from the @entity3 scandal came before the trial opened			2
" the @entity3 case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse , " @entity95 said			2
members of the @entity1 leadership , including president @entity160 , have described corruption as an existential threat to the @entity4			0
but they have so far been reluctant to pursue it too aggressively			0
analysts say that is largely because it is so rampant			0
@entity3 's case might have been a chance to make an example of a senior official			1
but his trial so far suggests that top leaders are unwilling to delve too deeply or punish him too severely			0
" the leadership wants to move forward			0
they want to put it behind them and move onto other issues , " @entity95 said			0
" that strategy , although it 's rational , will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system			0
" a dramatic downfall @entity3 is a princeling , a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence			2
his late father , @entity191 , was a revolutionary contemporary of @entity193 and former leader @entity194			0
over the past three decades , @entity3 rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the @entity198 , the powerful policymaking body of the @entity4			2
a charismatic and urbane politician , @entity3 was credited with a spectacular , albeit brutal , crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of @entity205 , a metropolis in southwestern @entity1			1
but when his deputy , @entity207 , walked into the @entity209 @entity208 in the city of @entity211 in february of last year and told @entity209 diplomats that @entity3 's wife , @entity213 , was an accomplice in a murder case , a glittering political career began to unravel			1
@entity207 's move precipitated @entity3 's political demise			1
soon after news of the events began to emerge , @entity3 was removed from his party posts			2
a court found @entity213 guilty last year of murdering @entity223 businessman @entity222 in a @entity205 hotel room in 2011			0
a family employee , @entity225 , was also convicted in the killing and sentenced to nine years in prison			0
the following month , @entity207 was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends , defection , abuse of power and bribe - taking			0
he received a 15 - year prison sentence			0
dispute over a villa @entity3 's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal			1
authorities have n't said how long it will last			0
but with only part of the charges addressed so far , it appears it could go on for longer than the two days some observers had predicted			0
some of the testimony friday concerned accusations that @entity3 was complicit in a complex deal @entity213 carried out to buy a villa in @entity247 , @entity248			1
a dispute over ownership of the villa resulted in a falling out with @entity222 , @entity213 said			0
in her video testimony , @entity213 said that @entity3 was aware that the purchase of the villa had been funded by @entity254 , a businessman in the northeastern port city of @entity256 , where @entity3 was once mayor			1
but @entity3 contested her accusation that he knew how the villa was paid for and poured scorn on her reliability as a witness			2
" what 's the credibility of @entity213 's testimony ? she has changed , she is insane , and she often tells lies , " he said			1
" she has been under severe pressure from the investigators to turn me in			0
" three indictments under the bribery indictment , prosecutors accuse @entity3 of using his political posts to secure influence for others			1
they say that between 2000 and 2012 , @entity3 , @entity273 and their son , @entity274 , received about 22 million renminbi ( $ 3.6 million ) in bribes from @entity254 and another @entity256 businessman , @entity278			2
the embezzlement charge alleges that @entity3 and @entity213 transferred 5 million renminbi of public money from a construction project in @entity256 to a private account through a law firm in @entity285			2
and the abuse of power indictment relates to @entity3 's actions after he was informed about his wife 's involvement in the killing of @entity222 and @entity207 's attempted defection to the @entity209			1
@entity3 trial : son @entity274 hopes father can ' answer his critics ' @entity2 's @entity296 and @entity297 reported from @entity0			1
@entity300 and @entity301 in @entity285 contributed to this report .			0
