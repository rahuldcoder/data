@entity0 -- the @entity2 endorsed @entity4 sen. @entity3 for the @entity6 presidential nomination over @entity7 and the rest of the @entity6 field , strongly criticizing the former mayor of its home city			1
sens. @entity3 , left , and @entity7 took part in a debate in @entity15 on thursday			1
in endorsements posted on its web site for friday 's editions , the @entity2 also endorsed @entity20 sen. @entity19 for the @entity22 nomination			2
" senator @entity3 of @entity4 is the only @entity6 who promises to end the @entity27 style of governing from and on behalf of a small , angry fringe , " the paper 's editorial board wrote			1
" with a record of working across the aisle to develop sound bipartisan legislation , he would offer a choice to a broader range of @entity35 than the rest of the @entity6 field			2
" the endorsement anticipated readers asking how the @entity20 paper could reject @entity7 , a man it endorsed for re-election in 1997 and praised for his work cleaning up crime in the city and during the time of the september 11 , 2001 attacks			1
" that man is not running for president , " the paper wrote			2
" the @entity7 of 2008 first shamelessly turned the horror of 9/11 into a lucrative business , with a secret client list , then exploited his city 's and the country 's nightmare to promote his presidential campaign , " the paper writes , describing @entity7 as " a narrow , obsessively secretive , vindictive man			1
" @entity7 played down the harsh words , suggesting that the @entity2 has a liberal editorial staff that often disapproved of him			2
" i probably never did anything the @entity2 suggested i do in eight years as mayor of @entity0 , and if i did , i would n't be considered a conservative @entity6 , " @entity7 said during a @entity6 debate thursday night hosted by @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity15			1
" i changed welfare , i changed quality of life , i took on homelessness -- i did all the things that they think makes you mean and i believe show true compassion and true love for people			0
" his was n't the only @entity6 campaign taking that tack			1
an e-mail from the campaign of former @entity80 gov. @entity79 sarcastically noted that @entity3 had been endorsed by " [ t ] hat bastion of conservative advocacy			1
" the editorial was hardly full of praise for @entity3 , despite calling him a " genuine war hero " and a " staunch advocate of campaign finance reform			0
" " mr. @entity3 was one of the first prominent republicans to point out how badly the war in @entity90 was being managed			0
we wish he could now see as clearly past the temporary victories produced by mr. @entity27 's unsustainable escalation , which have not led to any change in @entity90 's murderous political calculus , " it reads			0
" at the least , he owes @entity35 a real idea of how he would win this war , which he says he can do			0
" the paper praised @entity100 's chief rival , sen. @entity99 , but called @entity100 more qualified for the job			1
" it is unfair , especially after seven years of mr. @entity27 's inept leadership , but any @entity105 will face tougher questioning about his or her fitness to be commander in chief , " it reads			0
" mrs. @entity19 has more than cleared that bar , using her years in the @entity111 well to immerse herself in national security issues , and has won the respect of world leaders and many in the @entity35 military			0
" the @entity22 editorial contrasts @entity100 and @entity99 -- calling her " the brilliant if at times harsh - sounding senator from @entity20 " and him " the incandescent if still undefined senator from @entity121			0
" the paper says @entity100 " sometimes overstates the importance of [ her ] resume , " but that upon hearing " her policies and answers for @entity35 's big problems , we are hugely impressed by the depth of her knowledge , by the force of her intellect and by the breadth of , yes , her experience			0
" @entity20 is one of a host of states that will vote during the february 5 super tuesday primaries			0
