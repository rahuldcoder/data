with more planes searching than ever before , @entity4 prime minister @entity3 on sunday expressed optimism the mystery of @entity1 will be solved			1
" we have now had a number of very credible leads , and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope , no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill - fated aircraft , " @entity3 said			1
he spoke at a press conference about objects that have been spotted by satellites about 2,400 kilometers ( 1,500 miles ) off @entity19			2
in one of the great aviation mysteries in history , the airliner carrying 239 people disappeared march 8 after it took off from @entity26 on a flight to @entity28 , @entity29			2
@entity31 investigators believe it was deliberately diverted by someone on board			2
" obviously , the more aircraft we have , the more ships we have , the more confident we are of recovering whatever material is down there , " @entity3 said			2
" and obviously before we can be too specific about what it might be , we do actually need to recover some of this material			2
" the international search for the missing aircraft resumed early sunday near @entity19 , with a @entity45 p - 8 poseidon rejoining the effort , according to a naval spokesman			1
eight planes will search over the @entity49 on sunday , compared to six planes on saturday , said @entity51 , spokeswoman for the @entity52			1
she said that would be the most planes yet			0
planes from the @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity4 and @entity29 will be flying			1
three planes , two civilian aircraft and the p - 8 , were airborne by 7 a.m. @entity19 time ( 7 p.m. et )			0
new @entity29 satellite images " will be taken into consideration " in the search , @entity51 said			1
the @entity64 , grounded for two days to give its crew rest , will likely refocus on an area highlighted in @entity29 satellite images of a large object floating in the area			1
@entity4 - led search teams in the southern @entity49 found no sign of it saturday			1
the intense air and sea search -- which will now employ @entity75 satellites -- entered its third week with no new clues to give families answers about the fate of the passengers and crew			1
the object the @entity29 photographed is 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide ( 74 feet by 43 feet ) , officials said			1
@entity29 said the satellite images showing the " suspected floating object " were captured on march 18			1
as a result of the recently reported satellite sighting approximately 1,500 miles off the coast of @entity19 , plans are underway to acquire imagery within the next few days , @entity75 said saturday			1
the space agency said it will check archives of satellite data and use space - based assets such as the @entity97 - observing - 1 ( @entity96 - 1 ) satellite and the @entity99 camera on the @entity100 to acquire images of possible crash sites			0
the resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet ( 30 meters ) or larger			0
the @entity52 said searchers will take the @entity29 information into consideration as they design their search for sunday			1
the floating object was about 77 miles from where earlier satellite images spotted floating debris			1
at least six search flights were involved saturday , including two private jets			1
though the two civilian jets did not have radar , their role was crucial , authorities said			0
" it is more likely that a pair of eyes are going to identify something floating in the ocean , " @entity4 deputy prime minister @entity120 said			1
indeed , during saturday 's search it was a civil aircraft that reported sighting some small objects floating with the naked eye , including a wooden pallet , @entity52 said			1
these objects were within a radius of 5 kilometers ( 3 miles )			0
a @entity136 @entity135 p - 3 orion was dispatched to the area , but only reported seeing clumps of seaweed , @entity52 said			0
on saturday , the @entity141 merchant ship @entity142 was released from taking part in the search , according to @entity52			1
@entity4 officials thanked the ship 's crew for its " valuable assistance and efforts , " @entity52 said via @entity150			1
@entity1 vanished on march 8 with 239 people aboard destined for @entity28 from @entity26			0
the stated goal of the @entity31 authorities is to narrow the search area , a task that is proving difficult			2
intensified , expanded search the search area expanded sizably on saturday compared to the previous day , thanks in part to the capabilities of the civil jets			1
" operations continue , and today they plan to search an area of approximately 10,500 square nautical miles , " @entity161 said saturday			1
in addition to two @entity29 planes that arrived in @entity4 , @entity28 is sending two more ships to join five already in the southern corridor			1
" two @entity49 aircraft , a @entity170 and a @entity171 , arrived in @entity31 last night to assist with the search , " he said			2
seven countries -- @entity29 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 -- informed investigators that based on preliminary information , their nations had no radar sightings of missing jetliner			0
clues , but no proof an exhaustive search covering 2.97 million square miles -- nearly the size of the continental @entity56 -- has yielded some clues , but no proof of where the @entity192 is or what happened to it			2
one of the most notable leads revolved around two large objects detected by satellite a week ago floating on waters over 1,400 miles off @entity4 's west coast			1
" the fact that it 's six days ago that this imagery was captured does mean that clearly what objects were there , are likely to have moved a significant different distance as a result of currents and winds , " @entity120 said			0
" it 's also possible that they 've just drifted to the bottom of the ocean bed , and the ocean in this area is between 3 and 5 kilometers deep			0
so it 's a very , very deep part of the ocean , very remote			2
and all that makes it particularly difficult			0
" debris is a common sight in the waters in that part of the ocean , he said , and includes containers that fall off ships			2
@entity4 prime minister @entity3 on friday defended the decision to announce the find , saying @entity4 owes it to families of those missing " to give them information as soon as it 's to hand			1
" but he did n't make any promises			0
" it could just be a container that has fallen off a ship , " @entity3 said during a visit to @entity235			0
" we just do n't know			0
" @entity31 's interim transportation minister tried to reset expectations for a quick resolution to the mystery after the satellite discovery			2
" this is going to be a long haul , " @entity245 said			0
search intensifies @entity56 defense secretary @entity250 ordered the @entity45 and policy experts to look at the availability and usefulness of @entity56 military undersea technology to try to find the plane 's wreckage and its data recorders , a @entity56 military official said			1
the @entity56 has spent $ 2.5 million so far on the entire effort , @entity259 spokesman col. @entity258 said friday			2
first lady @entity262 , while on a trip to @entity28 , said the @entity56 is keeping the families of the missing passengers in its thoughts			0
" as my husband has said , ( the ) @entity56 ( is ) offering as many resources as possible to assist in the search , " she said			2
global search countries from central @entity271 to @entity4 are also engaged in the search along an arc drawn by authorities based on satellite pings received from the plane hours after it vanished			1
one arc tracks the southern @entity49 zone that 's the focus of current attention			0
" we intend to continue the search until we are absolutely satisfied that further searching would be futile , and that day is not in sight , " the deputy prime minister said			1
" we will continue the effort , we 'll continue to liaise with our international allies in this search			1
" the other tracks over parts of @entity291 , @entity177 , @entity29 and into @entity179			0
@entity31 authorities were awaiting permission from @entity179 's government to use the country as a staging area for the northern corridor search , @entity161 said			2
@entity299 ceo @entity298 told reporters saturday that a transcript obtained by @entity303 newspaper is " inaccurate , " but did not provide additional details			2
the @entity303 reported friday it had a transcript documenting 54 minutes of back - and - forth between the cockpit and ground control from taxiing in @entity26 to the final message of " all right , good night			0
" unexplained element the alleged transcript reported by @entity303 contains seemingly routine conversations about which runway to use and what altitude to fly at			0
one unexplained element , according to the @entity316 newspaper , is a call , in which someone in the cockpit stated that the aircraft was at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet -- something that had been done just six minutes earlier			0
twelve minutes after that comes the " good night " message , at around the time @entity1 was being transferred to @entity327 's control			0
another wrinkle : @entity299 chief executive officer @entity298 said the plane was carrying a cargo of lithium - ion batteries , although he did n't specify the volume of the shipment			0
lithium - ion batteries are commonly used in laptops and cell phones , and have been known to explode , although that occurs rarely			0
they were implicated in the fatal crash of a @entity340 cargo plane in @entity341 in 2010 , and lithium - ion batteries used to power components on @entity344 were blamed for fires in those planes			0
there 's no evidence the batteries played a role in the plane 's disappearance , and @entity298 said they are routine cargo aboard aircraft			0
" they are not declared dangerous goods " he said , adding that they were " some small batteries , not big batteries			0
" @entity31 authorities say they believe the missing plane was deliberately flown off course on its scheduled flight from @entity26 to @entity28 .			0
