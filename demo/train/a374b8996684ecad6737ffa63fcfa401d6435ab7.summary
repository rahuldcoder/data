@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's attorney general is " actively reviewing " an animal charity executive who had agreed not to take a higher office with another charity after a state investigation into how her previous employer had spent its donations , a spokesman for the ag 's office told @entity2			1
the woman at the center of the review , @entity18 , has been identified by @entity19 in its tax filings as one of its directors or officers			1
she also serves as the spokeswoman for the charity 's " @entity28 " program which , according to @entity19 , " helps @entity30 troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone			1
" before her work with @entity19 , @entity18 headed the @entity1 - based animal rescue charity @entity36 , which received millions of dollars in donations after @entity38 struck the @entity30 @entity39 in 2005			1
it promised to use the money to help animals affected by the disaster the @entity1 attorney general investigated whether contributions to @entity36 for " rescuing and caring for the animal victims of @entity38 " were used for that purpose			1
in the summer of 2007 , @entity36 reached a settlement agreement with the state of @entity1 in which the charity agreed to forfeit $ 4 million in donations out of the $ 8 million raised by the charity			1
under that settlement , @entity18 agreed not to " serve as an officer , director or trustee or in any position having the duties or responsibilities of an officer , director or trustee , with any nonprofit organization for a period of five ( 5 ) years from the date of the execution of this @entity67			1
" yet in a filing with the @entity69 secretary of state 's office last year , @entity19 named @entity18 in its list of officers and directors			1
@entity1 's attorney general launched the investigation into @entity36 after a bookkeeper with the charity and others alerted his office to questionable business practices			1
the former bookkeeper , who wants to conceal her identity for reasons unrelated to her work at @entity36 , told @entity2 that donations came pouring into @entity36 soon after @entity38			0
@entity18 had appealed for donations on numerous television networks , including @entity2			1
" there was cash , there were checks , there were cashiers checks , there were letters -- heartbreaking letters from kids who , instead of having birthday parties , they wanted all the money to go to @entity36 to help those poor little animals , " the woman said			0
" on a given day , we would have , oh my gosh , easily $ 20,000 ... just in checks			0
" and she said suddenly @entity18 changed , hiring her daughter and acting as if the money was hers to keep			1
both made six - figure salaries , the former bookkeeper said			0
" @entity18 at one time said , ' i 've worked hard for so many years , doing animal rescue , i am entitled to this money			2
' " when approached by @entity2 at her @entity0 , @entity1 , home , @entity18 told @entity2 she has " nothing to hide " but refused to answer any detailed questions without permission from the organization 's communications director			1
@entity2 requested an on - camera interview several weeks ago from @entity121 , the @entity19 public relations director , but @entity122 never responded either by phone or e-mail			2
standing on the lawn of her home , @entity18 told @entity2 that " you 've taken a lot of the information " provided by @entity19 and " reported it incorrectly			1
" @entity2 said now was her chance to correct the record she saw as inaccurate			0
" i would love to but as i said , i 'm an employee of @entity19			2
" she added , " i ca n't answer any of your questions			0
believe me , i would love to			0
" she did tell @entity2 that the @entity36 board of directors set her salary and that she is now an employee , not a director , at @entity19			1
a @entity2 investigation into @entity19 found that the charity raised close to $ 27 million to help animals worldwide but spent nearly all of that money on fund - raising expenses paid to a direct - mail company			1
in 2010 , @entity19 owed $ 8.4 million to @entity145 and its affiliated company , @entity146 , according to publicly available @entity148 990 tax records			2
@entity145 is one of the world 's largest direct - mail providers to charities and nonprofits			0
it is the same fund - raiser hired by two veterans charities that spent tens of millions of dollars for its services -- triggering a @entity158 investigation last month into whether one of the charities should retain its tax - exempt status			0
that charity , @entity162 - based @entity161 , collected nearly $ 56 million in donations over the past three years yet paid @entity145 more than $ 60 million in fees , according to a @entity2 investigation into the charity 's tax records			2
the other veterans charity , @entity169 , raised more than $ 22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans yet spent about $ 18.2 million to pay @entity145 , according to @entity148 990 forms			0
@entity19 is still in debt to @entity145 , according to a spokeswoman for the direct - mail firm , adding that 's part of the charity 's " aggressive strategy " to build a broad donor base			1
" that resulted in an expected high cost in the beginning of their acquisition program , " said the spokeswoman , who declined to be named			0
she called @entity19 's efforts a " successful strategy			1
" there 's no question that a charity needs to spend money to raise money , according to @entity193 , president of the charity watchdog group guidestar			2
but he said that @entity19 's tax records raise " a number of red flags			1
" " no. 1 , there is an enormous amount of money going into fund - raising , " @entity193 said			0
" it 's not unusual for a nonprofit to fund - raise			0
in fact they need to fund - raise			0
but this organization has an enormous amount of fund - raising costs , certainly relative to the amount of money being spent			0
" of the $ 14 million raised in 2010 , @entity19 reports it spent less than 0.5 % -- about $ 60,000 -- in small cash grants to animal shelters across the @entity30			2
it also said it spent about $ 450,000 -- about 3 % of the total raised in 2010 -- to bring back animals from @entity216 and @entity217 as part of its " @entity28 " program			0
in addition to its questionable finances , @entity2 found that @entity19 misrepresented the " @entity28 " program on its tax filings			2
on its website and its tax filings , @entity19 describes as a program that " helps @entity30 troops safely transport home the companion animals they befriend in the war zone			2
" yet the charity admitted that only 26 of the nearly 500 animals transported to the @entity30 from @entity216 and @entity217 were actually service animals			0
the rest were stray animals , said @entity121 , the charity 's communications director			0

under a 2007 settlement , @entity18 agreed not to serve as a charity official
yet , last year , she was named as one of @entity19 's directors and officers
