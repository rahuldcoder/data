-- after @entity2 beat @entity3 at the @entity4 , it looked as if a first all @entity2 tennis final in five years was on the cards			1
but someone forgot to tell @entity8			1
the @entity9 stunned a sluggish @entity10 in the second semifinal friday , meaning a @entity2 versus @entity2 clash for silverware -- they have n't met in a finale since the year - end championships in 2009 -- will have to wait			1
it was @entity10 ' first tournament since a back injury hampered the 17 - time grand slam champion at the @entity20 , and she accepted a wildcard from organizers to fend off the boredom from just practicing			1
perhaps rust was an issue			2
@entity10 likened her play against @entity8 in the 64 64 reverse to a ' turtle ' and gave herself the harshest of grades			1
" i started out extremely slow , " @entity2 was quoted as saying by the @entity32 's website			1
" i have actually been looking at a turtle every day -- it 's a really cute turtle in the hotel			2
maybe i was too influenced by it			0
i need to play better than that if i want to be playing on the professional tour			2
maybe i can go to the amateurs			0
" i have n't felt good this whole week , to be honest , just from my first match			0
" she played really well			0
i did n't play well			0
i just kept hitting errors			0
i do n't think i 've made that many errors in a match in at least three , maybe four years			0
i think out of a 10 , i was at , like , -283 , so ... wow			0
" @entity8 , @entity9 's no. 1 , had lost all three of her previous encounters against @entity10 and was 0 - 17 lifetime against the top four , but she served impeccably against the @entity48			1
she took advantage of @entity2 ' normally strong second serve , winning 62 percent of those points , and did her usual scrambling from the baseline			1
" it 's my best ever win , but i have n't realized it yet , " @entity8 told reporters			2
" i played a very good match			0
i did n't even realize who i was playing and that 's the way i had to be			2
" i forgot it was @entity10 on the other side and just got on with my game			2
" @entity2 has been slowed by @entity62 , injuries and age but the elder @entity2 continues to flourish in @entity65 , winning her last 14 matches			1
the 33 - year - old owned a 4 - 0 record against former world no. 1 @entity3 -- without losing a set -- prior to the semifinals and once again the @entity72 was overpowered , losing this time 63 62			1
" i feel like i 've just gotten so much better since my first round to now , feeling comfortable on the court , feeling comfortable when i 'm behind , feeling comfortable when i 'm in the lead , " @entity2 was quoted as saying by the @entity32 's website			2
" it reminds me of when i first came on tour , just having to learn a lot , and i feel like i 'm learning those lessons all over again			0
" i had a lot of tough losses , and i realized i had to go through it			0
even if i did n't necessarily get the result i wanted , i realized i was getting better			0
" for me , and for every player , you just have to keep stepping up to the line and believing in yourself			0
" if @entity8 downs @entity2 , she would become one of the few players to beat the sisters at the same tournament			1
@entity8 , though , trails @entity2 3 - 0 in their head - to - heads .			1
