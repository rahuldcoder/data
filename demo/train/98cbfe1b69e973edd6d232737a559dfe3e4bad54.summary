@entity0 : when did you first get interested in the protesting ? @entity52 : the @entity1 people started protesting in november , after the authorities announced they were not ready to sign an agreement with the @entity26			1
a lot of people , including me , were disappointed by this action			0
@entity0 : why are people continuing to protest in @entity1 ? @entity52 : after the violent crackdowns by police on peaceful demonstrations of students , the protests got another vector			1

@entity0 : can you describe who the average @entity1 protester is ? @entity52 : the average protester is mostly middle - aged people with an active civil position			2
they are taking part in the protesting because they resent the arbitrariness of the authorities			0
@entity0 : where else is protesting happening in @entity1 ? @entity52 : the protests are going on not only in @entity32 , but also in other cities -- mostly regional ones			1
people organize peaceful meetings , which the government is trying to disperse			0
but as far as i can tell , these actions do n't disrupt the life and work in these cities in general			0
@entity0 : what do protesters want the @entity1 government to know ? @entity52 : first of all , we hope that government will find the courage to recognize their illegal actions ; such as the use of force on peaceful protesters and will stop the violence from their side , will release all of protesters arrested earlier , and sit at the negotiations table with the opposition			1
@entity1 opposition rejects president 's offer @entity0 : what are your thoughts on a possible truce between protesters and the government ? @entity52 : i think that a truce will help the situation of course because we do n't want to see the blood and death on our streets ! i ca n't predict what will happen next , but i hope that government will finally stop the violence against civilians , will listen to its people , the world , and the @entity6 community and will start a constructive dialogue			1
@entity0 : how long will people continue to protest ? @entity52 : given what i hear from the protesters , they are willing to stay till the end and till the victory of democracy			2
cold weather certainly has an impact on the protesters , but volunteers and citizens of @entity32 bring them hot food and drinks like tea and coffee -- but not the alcohol			1
@entity0 : what do you want the world to know about the situation in @entity1 ? @entity52 : i want people around the world to know about the situation in our country and support @entity1 in the fight for freedom and democracy			1
