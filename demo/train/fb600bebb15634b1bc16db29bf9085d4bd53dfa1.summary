-- @entity2 's president says comments he made more than two years ago that are being criticized as anti-semitic were taken out of context , @entity2 's official news agency reported wednesday			0
president @entity6 said the statements , made in 2010 , were about @entity9 aggression against @entity10 in @entity11 , not about the @entity13 people , according to a statement published in @entity15			1
@entity17 senators visiting @entity18 on wednesday confronted him about the comments , according to one of the senators			1
" in our meeting with president @entity6 , we voiced our strong disapproval of statements he made a few years ago that have recently surfaced , " sen. @entity22 , @entity23 , said in a written statement			1
" we had a constructive discussion on this subject			1
we leave it to the president to make any further comments on this matter that he may wish			0
" the congressional trip also included sens. @entity38 , @entity39 - @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 - @entity43 ; @entity44 , @entity45 ; @entity46 , @entity42 - @entity47 ; @entity48 , @entity49 ; and @entity50 , @entity51			0
the group met with leadership , business and other @entity2 groups			0
@entity6 told the @entity17 delegation he is committed to respecting religions , and to the principle of freedom of belief and religious practice			1
@entity6 backs @entity63 calls for @entity64 to face war crimes " president @entity6 also added that it 's necessary to separate between @entity68 and the @entity13 people , and the violent practices against the unarmed @entity10 and the assaults on their lives and properties , " according to the @entity2 news report			2
on tuesday , the @entity76 administration strongly condemned @entity6 's recorded comments and called on him to repudiate what he said			2
@entity80 spokeswoman @entity79 called the comments " deeply offensive ... language that espouses religious hatred			2
" in the recording , @entity6 says @entity87 and @entity88 " must cut off all relations with this plundering criminal entity " and " besiege the @entity89 , " whom he calls " bloodsuckers , " " warmongers " and " descendants of apes and pigs			1
" " we want to see president @entity6 make absolutely clear to his own people , to the international community that he respects people of all faiths , " @entity79 said on tuesday			2
the @entity102 , in a clearly coordinated statement , also condemned @entity6 's statements			1
spokesman @entity104 told reporters , " this kind of discourse has been acceptable in the region for far too long and is counter to the goal of peace			0
president @entity6 should make clear that he respects people of all faiths and that this type of rhetoric is not acceptable or productive in a democratic @entity2			2
" the comments , which @entity6 made as a then - leader of the @entity117 's political wing , immediately raised questions about whether he can be trusted to respect @entity2 's 1979 peace treaty with @entity9			1
even as she condemned @entity6 's remarks , the @entity80 spokeswoman noted that since he has been president , @entity6 " has reaffirmed again , and again " @entity2 's commitment to peace with @entity9			1
" he has been willing to work with us , and with @entity9 , on shared objectives , including the cease - fire in @entity11 , " @entity79 said			2
" he 's been committed to our bilateral relationship			0
so ... that is the basis on which we are continuing to work together going forward			0
" she added , however , " we will judge him by what he does ... but we 'll also judge him by ... what he says			0
and we think that these comments should be repudiated and they should be repudiated firmly			0
" asked whether @entity6 's comments could damage relations with the @entity17 , @entity79 said @entity17 officials hope that making the administration 's views clear to the @entity2 leader and inducing him to publicly step away from his comments might tamp down what could be an angry reaction from members of @entity143			1
she told reporters , " we certainly have made the @entity2 aware that we are continuing to seek economic support funds for @entity2 on @entity146 , and they are very well aware that these kinds of issues are of concern there , too			0
" last autumn , rep. @entity151 , @entity152 , chairwoman of the @entity154 subcommittee on foreign operations , placed a hold on $ 450 million in @entity17 economic support for @entity2 after that nation cracked down on democracy support groups .			0
