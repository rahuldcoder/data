-- the real @entity2 is probably someone " @entity2 , " the character , would find easy to mock			1
the real @entity2 is reportedly just a regular guy who lives in a @entity4 suburb with his wife and three kids , has taught sunday school and says earnest things like " i really admire newsmen " when explaining that he does n't confuse his @entity2 character with an actual journalist			1
fans have readily embraced the blustering buffoonery of the conservative character @entity2 , who arrives on the " @entity16 " set to calls of " @entity2 ! @entity2 ! " it remains to be seen if they will have equal affection for the man @entity2 who will replace @entity22 as host of " @entity24 " in 2015			1
even colbert the character is aware of how tough that just might be			2
" i got ta tell you , i do not envy whoever they try to put in that chair , " he said with a wink on his thursday night show as the audience cheered			0
" those are some huge shoes to fill			0
" if anyone is used to challenges , it 's @entity2			1
raised in @entity39 , @entity40 , the youngest of 11 children , he was just 10 years old when his father and two of his brothers were killed in a plane crash in 1974			2
@entity46 crashed in a cornfield near @entity48 , @entity49 , and 72 people were killed			0
@entity2 told @entity51 it took him years to grieve their deaths			1
" i did n't really really feel the loss until i was in college , " he said " then , oh , i was in bad shape			2
" he told the @entity58 in 2012 that he credits his mother with helping him survive the tragedy			1
" she taught me to be grateful for my life regardless of what that entailed , and that 's directly related to the image of @entity68 on the cross and the example of sacrifice that he gave us , " said @entity2 , a devout @entity61			1
" what she taught me is that the deliverance @entity76 offers you from pain is not no pain -- it 's that the pain is actually a gift			0
what 's the option ? @entity76 does n't really give you another choice			0
" @entity2 says it was his mother who encouraged him to enter @entity88 's theater program , which led him into improv and a gig with @entity93 's famous @entity92 troupe			1
it was there he struck up friendships with @entity97 and @entity98			0
@entity2 eventually landed in @entity99 where he briefly worked with @entity101 's " @entity100 " as they needed someone who " looked straight , but could act funny , " he told @entity0 's " @entity104 " in 2007			1
" they really just wanted me to quip , " he said			0
" i did one piece for them			0
" " @entity100 " shot down several other story ideas he pitched , @entity2 said , but his credentials from them came in handy when " @entity113 " came calling in 1997 looking for correspondents			1
@entity2 had written a little for " @entity114 " and his combination of comedy chops and the brief experience working with " @entity100 " made him " genetically engineered " to work with the show , he said he was told			1
thus , the character of " @entity2 " was introduced to the world			1
one person who could do without his alter ego is his wife , @entity121 , whom he married in 1993			2
she told @entity51 that other @entity2 is not welcomed in their home			1
" i do n't really like the other guy , " she said			0
" he does n't come in this house			0
" her husband is smart , funny and incredibly romantic , @entity121 said			0
he is also intensely private , though he works hard to connect with his audiences and fans , he told @entity130			0
" i was 22 or 23 when i made a decision not to be actively @entity132 - like and miserable in my daily life , and the decision helped a lot , " he said			0
" living vitally is not easier than living morbidly -- it 's just better			0
people are all we 've got			0
" @entity2 will have to rely on such fans to make his new venture a success			1
@entity142 of the @entity143 wonders at his crossover appeal once colbert the character has been vanquished			2
" whether mr. @entity2 can maintain his following as a different persona , no longer cloaked in parody , is n't guaranteed , " she writes , noting that " @entity146 is arguably the most middle of the road of the broadcast networks			1
" @entity2 's old boss has no worries			1
on " @entity113 , " @entity158 said , " the exciting news is that i no longer need a cable subscription for the privilege of watching @entity2			2
" " i think @entity2 is up for the challenge , " @entity158 said			2
" so while we wish @entity22 the absolute best for a well - earned retirement , there 's no greater joy for seeing a genuinely good man , who works as hard as he can every day and deserves all the success in the world , actually get that success			0
for @entity2 we 're just thrilled			2

@entity2 will not be in character on " @entity24 "
he credits his mother with helping him survive the loss of his dad and two brothers
