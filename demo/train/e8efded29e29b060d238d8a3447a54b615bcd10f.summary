the first man out the gate in the 2016 race for the @entity3 is already facing scrutiny over payments his pac made to his wife and daughter			1
a political action committee headed by former sen. @entity10 , the @entity11 who launched a presidential exploratory committee last month , has paid more than $ 90,000 to his wife and daughter since late 2006 -- with close to half of that amount doled out in 2014 alone , according to @entity15 filings			1
the information was first reported by @entity17			0
a @entity10 spokesperson defended the expenses in an email to @entity21 , explaining that payments to @entity10 's wife and daughter increased in 2014 to a total of $ 37,000 to revamp @entity10 's personal website and create his 2016 exploratory committee page before he announced his plans to fundraise for a prospective presidential bid			1
" adding up numbers across several years for a sensational headline does n't tell the story , " the spokesperson said			0
" the activities of the pac increased in 2014 when @entity10 decided to re-enter the political discussions of our country			2
" the spokesperson added that the payments were " well within the law " and " much lower " than typical compensation			2
@entity10 's daughter , @entity41 , drew most of the disbursements , charging her father 's pac $ 24,000 in 2014 alone for " administrative consulting services , " which included administering , managing and designing the @entity43 's website , sen. @entity10 's personal site and creating the @entity49 website			1
@entity50 is the ceo of @entity51 , a digital strategy firm based in @entity53 , though the payments from the pac went directly to her			0

the @entity43 has not spent any of its funds on donations to political candidates or groups since oct. 2010 , though it has continued to receive donations from supporters , according to @entity15 filings			0
and the payments to @entity10 's family amount to nearly 10 % of all contributions the @entity43 received and only about 20 % of donations to the pac went to political candidates or groups , @entity17 reported			1
the @entity43 continues to accept donations online and the website now also links to sen. @entity10 's 2016 exploratory committee website			1
@entity10 , a @entity85 veteran , touted his bipartisan credentials and his military ties in a 14 - minute video he posted last month announcing his intention to form an exploratory committee for 2016 , which allows him to raise funds for a potential run and is typically the first step to formally announcing a presidential bid			0
if he does , @entity10 will likely face former secretary of state @entity95 in the @entity97 ' primary process			0
@entity98 is expected to announce a presidential bid next year .			0
