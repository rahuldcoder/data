@entity0 -- an insidious , microscopic protein that has been found in the brain tissue of professional football players after death may now be detectable in living people by scanning their brains			1
researchers say they found tau protein in the brains of five living retired @entity12 players with varying levels of cognitive and emotional problems			1
" it 's definite , we found it , it 's there , " said dr. @entity15 , co-director of the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , and co-author of a new study that identified the tau			1
" it was there consistently and in all the right places			0
" using a scan called positron emission tomography , or @entity32 -- typically used to measure nascent alzheimer 's disease -- researchers injected the players with a radioactive marker that travels through the body , crosses the blood - brain barrier and latches on to tau			1
then , the @entity12 retirees had their brains scanned			1
" we found ( the tau ) in their brains , it lit up , " said dr. @entity41 , professor of psychiatry at the @entity43 at @entity44 and lead author of the study , published tuesday in the @entity47 of @entity48			1
what was startling , said @entity41 , was the specific pattern of the tau they found : " it was identical to what 's seen in a condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy , @entity58 , that has only been diagnosed at autopsy			1
" @entity58 is the disease that most likely played a role in the deaths of former @entity12 players like @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity68			1
what has stymied researchers for years is that tau can only be uncovered after death			1
finding it in living players is considered by many researchers to be the " holy grail " of concussion research , according to @entity15			1
" after a while it gets old and not so fulfilling to take the brain out when ( an athlete ) is dead , " said @entity15 , a neurosurgeon and director of the @entity79 , which focuses on the study of traumatic brain injuries and their prevention			2
" at that point there is no solution , no answer			0
" more cases of brain disease found in football players the research provides the beginnings of an answer , according to @entity15 and @entity41			1
but the study is tiny , and poses looming questions			2
" this is a very exciting but preliminary study , " said @entity99 , co-founder of the @entity100 at the @entity101			2
" the researchers did what so many of us have been wanting to do for the last couple of years			0
" the problem is that the type of @entity32 they used is really not specific to what we 're looking at with chronic traumatic encephalopathy			1
" the marker used in the pet scan -- the one that binds to tau -- is called @entity117			2
the problem with using that marker , said @entity99 , is that it is not specific enough			0
it binds not just to tau , but also to another protein called beta amyloid , which is commonly seen in @entity124 's disease patients			1
" in @entity58 , only tau is found in abundance , " said @entity99 , an @entity124 's expert			1
" what researchers saw was parts of the brain lighting up and showing abnormal findings			2
... but we do n't know if what is lighting up is tau alone , or beta amyloid , or both			0
" it 's the location of the protein that is important , @entity41 said			0
in alzheimer 's disease , tau is typically found in the outer part of the brain , called the cortex			1
" it 's different from @entity124 's , " said @entity41 , director of the @entity143 , adding that he found tau in deeper structures of the brain			2
" the patterns of the scans are identical to what 's seen at autopsy in other people ( with @entity58 ) , " like @entity68 , @entity65 and @entity152 , he said			1
" and we know at autopsy it 's primarily tau			0
" when tau lodges into those deep brain structures -- for example , the amygdala , which is associated with rage and other emotions , or the hippocampus , a seat of memory -- it causes major disruptions to those areas			0
questions linger about long - term impact of subtle hits to the head that disruption may be related to depression , memory problems and suicidal behavior common in cases of @entity58 studied thus far -- not just in retired @entity12 players , but in athletes in other sports and members of the military			1
the hope among the study 's authors is that a diagnostic brain scan might one day detect burgeoning cte in all sorts of people who suffer concussions			0
but the current study is drawing some skepticism , doubts that likely will not ebb until future research examines a larger study group			0
" sometimes i wish ( study authors ) would hang on and wait until they have a more meaningful sample size , " said @entity191 , a concussion expert and director of the @entity194 at the @entity195 at @entity196			0
" i think that then people would be less skeptical of the findings			0
" still , @entity201 is encouraged by the study results			0
" unfortunately we tend to identify these ( @entity58 ) cases when they 're already on the slippery slope toward dementia and it 's too late to do anything , " said @entity191			2
" i 'm all for trying to build on studies like this			0
" building on the research -- expanding the study population -- is what @entity41 and @entity15 are working on now			0
in the meantime , they are optimistic about their findings			0
" right now , the ( @entity117 ) @entity32 scan is the only method that we know of that can measure tau protein in living people , " said @entity41			2
" it 's not the perfect holy grail ... but for now it seems to be showing us what we 're looking for			0
" football players more likely to develop neurodegenerative disease			0

researchers find a protein called tau in the brains of living retired @entity12 players
its pattern is identical to that found in chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases
@entity58 can only be diagnosed after death
more study is needed to *confirm* the findings
