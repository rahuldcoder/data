-- on tuesday , president @entity1 was at the @entity2 , joining leaders of @entity4 to dedicate a statue in honor of the " mother of the @entity8 , " @entity9 's @entity7			2
about the same time , across the street at the @entity12 , an @entity9 lawyer was arguing that a key provision of the @entity14 -- the consequence and legacy of the @entity8 -- was unnecessary and unconstitutional			1
the irony lies not only in the timing or juxtaposition , but the institutions			0
on december 1 , 1955 , @entity7 refused to give up her seat when a white bus driver ordered her to move			0
twelve years earlier , the same driver had grabbed her coat sleeve and pushed her off his bus for trying to enter through the front rather than the back door			0
this time he said , " well , if you do n't stand up , i 'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested			0
" she replied , " you may do that			0
" her arrest led to a 381 - day boycott of @entity37 buses by the black community			0
the boycott propelled the rev. @entity40 to prominence as a civil rights leader			0
and the arrest of @entity7 and the boycott she inspired led to a civil law suit , @entity45 , in which the @entity12 declared the @entity9 and @entity37 laws requiring segregated buses unconstitutional			0
it took @entity4 10 years to catch up to the @entity12 , when it passed the @entity14 in 1965			1
although @entity9 's at it again with the new challenge , this time it seems the conservative majority of the @entity12 wants to roll back the clock			2
@entity55 , the attorney for plaintiff @entity56 , argues that @entity4 exceeded its authority in 2006 when it reauthorized section 5 of the @entity14 for another 25 years			1
@entity60 : chief justice out to end affirmative action section 5 is the heart of the @entity14			1
areas of the country with a history of voter suppression and intimidation -- determined decades ago by a formula devised by @entity4 -- must submit any changes in their election laws to the @entity73 for clearance			1
the jurisdictions covered include six @entity77 states , @entity78 and parts of other states , including @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and sections of @entity85			2
@entity4 did extensive research before reauthorizing the act in 2006 , and recent studies prove @entity63 works well in targeting places where discriminatory voter practices exist			1
this is evidenced by successful lawsuits brought under section 2 of the @entity14 , which bars " voting qualification " that " results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the @entity100 to vote on account of race or color			1
" as justice @entity104 pointed out , " under any formula that @entity4 could devise , " @entity9 would still be a targeted state			0
but neither facts , history or legal precedent deterred justice @entity109 from deciding he alone would be better qualified to do @entity4 ' job			1
he said last week that @entity63 amounted to a " perpetuation of racial entitlement " that " will be re-enacted in perpetuity unless a court can say it does not comport with the @entity115			1
... it 's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to @entity4 ... even the @entity121 senators ... are going to lose votes if they do not re-enact			2
" so , protecting the right to vote -- not just of blacks , by the way , but of @entity126 in @entity78 , @entity127 in @entity81 , and even @entity128 - speaking @entity126 in @entity83 -- is a " racial entitlement			1
" and legislative questions ca n't be left to @entity4			0
and -- horrors ! -- a senator 's vote might be influenced by how the citizens he represents will respond			2
after all , that democracy thing might interfere with @entity109 's judicial fiats			1
four years ago , chief justice @entity138 wrote , with respect to @entity63 , that " things have changed in the @entity77			1
" really ? tell that to the citizens of the five @entity82 counties covered by @entity63 of the @entity14			1
this year , @entity82 tried to cut early voting hours in those counties			0
a panel of federal judges refused to allow it , thanks to @entity63			2
( @entity149 who would have been disenfranchised if the cutback had gone through ? ) a panel of federal judges in @entity154 also knows that times have not changed			0
that 's why they rejected , again under @entity63 , a new photo id law that would have imposed " strict , unforgiving burdens " on poor and minority voters			1
under that proposal , by the way , you could vote with a gun license but not a student or veteran 's @entity158			0
another justice , last week , raised the specter of " state sovereignty			0
" a little history , courtesy of president @entity175 , in remarks to @entity4 given on july 4 , 1861 : " ... no one of our states , except @entity154 , ever was a sovereignty ; and even @entity154 gave up the character on coming into the @entity172 ... " ( @entity179 did @entity180			0
) much as @entity109 and his cohorts would like to legislate -- or dictate -- from the bench , the @entity12 can only decide if a law is constitutional			2
and as a @entity185 essay argues , @entity4 authorized preclearance -- section 5 of the @entity14 -- under @entity63 of the 14th amendment			1
and that makes it constitutional			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity193 : the high court heard arguments on @entity63 of the @entity14
section 5 protects *people* in parts of nation from voter intimidation , she says
she says @entity109 questioned " racial entitlement " of @entity63
@entity193 : voter suppression attempts continue ; @entity208 calls for @entity63 's protections
