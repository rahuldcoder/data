-- the fall of the @entity2 , and the eventual disintegration of the @entity4 , were overwhelmingly positive events -- a near miracle , in fact , given the potential for widespread chaos and violence			1
but as we prepare to mark the 25th anniversary of the @entity15 's fall , it is important to also remember some of the less pleasant side - effects			1
indeed , this sunday and beyond we have a responsibility to consider not only the joy and liberation of so many in @entity20 at the time , but also the repercussions that landmark event continues to have for the world today			2
for a start , it 's worth remembering that not all @entity28 policymakers were thrilled , at least in the early stages , at the prospect of the end of the @entity32 and the collapse of the @entity4			2
after all , although the @entity32 offered a wretched global order , it was at least a form of order			2
and so it was not unreasonable for those who remembered at least one global conflict -- @entity41 -- to feel a little anxiety about state disintegration and the potential spread of nuclear weapons , among other things			2
but the end of the @entity32 was not just about the break up of the @entity4 empire			2
in fact , it involved three related but distinct events -- the end of a global strategic confrontation between @entity55 , the @entity4 , and their allies and proxies ; the effective end of a global ideological struggle between capitalism and communism ; and the partial disintegration of the @entity63 , of which the @entity4 was simply the latest manifestation			1
the end of the global confrontation was as much , if not more , of a relief in what used to be known as the @entity68 , or non-aligned countries			1
it is easy for those who live in @entity20 and @entity72 to forget that this " cold war " did not feel that way at all in swathes of @entity75 , @entity76 and the @entity77 , where regional conflicts and civil wars both fed and were exacerbated by the wider tensions between the world 's two great power blocks			0
and while it may be no comfort to the people of the former @entity88 , or the victims of the genocide in @entity91 , for example , the absence of such confrontation has contributed to the steady decline of conflict worldwide , as well as easing the considerable fears over a possible nuclear exchange and conflict			1
but the end of the ideological struggle arguably began a decade before 1989 , with the partial conversion , at least in economic terms , of @entity101 under @entity102			0
in fact , one could argue that even before the late 1980s , the @entity4 and its satellites were no longer trying to spread a credible alternative to capitalism , but were instead simply clinging on for dear life			0
( although @entity4 leaders might smile wryly at the scene now , where democracy has found its credibility battered by a global financial crisis and the seeming dysfunction of its political institutions )			0
still , as we are frequently reminded , the collapse of the @entity4 was a traumatic and humiliating experience for many of its citizens , even if it also resulted in unmitigated jubilation for comparable numbers of others			0
indeed , even today , the combination of the dramatic loss of global status , the perceived dismembering of its country by foreign powers , and the economic hardship many @entity130 experienced in the transition to the political system of their country 's former enemy has produced a toxic cocktail for much of @entity130 society			1
the fact is that cynicism and arbitrary rule have displaced the heady optimism of the 1990s , and in many @entity130 ' eyes , liberal democracy is ( wrongly ) considered to have been tried and thoroughly discredited			1
such perceived failures have left us where we are now , in a new strategic and ideological confrontation between @entity130 and the @entity147 over @entity148			1
however , unlike the @entity32 , this tension is regional , not global , and it is portrayed by @entity130 president @entity150 as being between " liberal " and " conservative " values , not capitalism and communism			1
( and it is also being fought mostly through non-conventional , economic and information warfare , rather than an enormous buildup of hard power , although a more conventional conflict has raged in the east of @entity148 )			0
why is all this worth remembering now ? because 25 years on , it is no longer satisfactory only to discuss what may have disappeared between 1989 and 1991 -- we must also consider what eventually replaced it			0
the harsh reality , despite the excitement and optimism at the time , is that the @entity32 order did not give way to peace and prosperity across the world			0
instead , we have a messier picture , with varying degrees of success and failure			0
from the war in @entity148 to the unrest in the @entity180 , the @entity147 is faced with threats to its security that are less clear - cut than our confrontation with the @entity4 , and also less predictable and much harder to understand			1
this is the reality we have inherited , and we must maintain our vigilance and be more creative in developing strategies to address the challenges we face			0
the @entity189 , if it ever existed , is over .			0
