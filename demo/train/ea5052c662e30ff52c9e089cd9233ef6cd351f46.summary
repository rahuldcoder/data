in terms of online entertainment , the @entity0 seemed to have it all			2
there was a cannibalistic @entity5			0
@entity6 saving ... well ... everything			0
oh , yeah ... and the actual matches , which saw the @entity16 team make an inspiring run , the powerhouse @entity8 unravel in shocking fashion and the @entity13 ultimately capture first prize on sunday			0

on @entity27 , sunday 's final between @entity25 and @entity26 alone spurred 280 million interactions by 88 million people , according to the company			1

things were similarly fast and furious on @entity36 , where the match was inspiring more than 618,000 tweets per minute , a new record for the site			1
there were a total of 32.1 million tweets about the match			0
take those numbers and tack them onto the huge online engagement the tournament had already inspired and it 's a no - brainer that @entity49 2014 enjoyed online fandom like no event before it			0
from june 12 to july 13 , 350 million people generated a massive 3 billion @entity0 posts , comments and likes , according to @entity27			0

" this has been the first truly mobile and social @entity0 , " @entity61 president @entity76 said			1
" the 1 billion attendance in the global stadium created the sense of togetherness the @entity0 brings and the shared excitement that digital platforms offer			0
" certainly , the global appeal of the @entity0 played a huge part in the tournament 's popularity			1
but the big numbers were clearly being bolstered by growing interest in the @entity16 , one of the few nations where soccer is n't , hands - down , the most popular sport			0
during sunday 's final , 10.5 million of the people engaged on @entity27 were from the @entity16			1
compare that to the 7 million people in @entity26 and 5 million in @entity25 , the match 's actual participants , and you can see that @entity16 interest in the tourney did n't disappear when the @entity16 side bowed out			1
in the 28 days before the @entity16 team lost to @entity108 in the knockout round , 36.7 million @entity16 fans engaged with the @entity0 's online properties , a spokesman for the organization said			1
