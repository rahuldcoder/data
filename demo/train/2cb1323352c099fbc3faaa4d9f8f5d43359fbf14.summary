-- second terms , untainted by re-election posturing , often reveal a president 's true governing philosophy			2
in the case of president @entity7 , two recent revelations have confirmed all we may need to know about his agenda for the next four years			1
on december 30 , the president sat down for an interview with @entity13 on " @entity14			2
" @entity13 asked the president , " so what is your single priority of the second term ? what is the equivalent to health care ? " president @entity7 replied , " well , there are a couple of things that we need to get done			1
i 've said that fixing our broken immigration system is a top priority			2
i will introduce legislation in the first year to get that done			0
" he went on to say , " the second thing that we 've got to do is to stabilize the economy and make sure it 's growing			0
" during his first term in office , coming off " the worst recession since the @entity42 , " to use the president 's own words , it appeared to many that he prioritized @entity44 over the economy			0
now it appears that the economy , and all that goes along with it , like the ever - growing national debt , will again play second fiddle , this time to immigration reform			1
if priorities are any reflection of politics , it appears the president is more concerned with what he regards as historic , landmark legislation to build his legacy , rather than the economic well - being of the nation			1
if that seems like a harsh assessment , consider that just this week we learned from @entity67 's interview of house speaker @entity68 in the @entity69 that the president told @entity68 during the fiscal cliff negotiations , " we do n't have a spending problem			1
" if $ 16 trillion of national debt and the huge deficits each year are n't spending problems , then what is ? the @entity77 most certainly has a spending problem			1
for the president to insist otherwise is dumbfounding but at the same time entirely consistent with his policies			0
he called for the @entity83 on deficit reduction , but ignored their recommendations			0
he campaigned ad nauseam about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction , but the latest fiscal cliff deal is almost entirely tax hikes and even includes more stimulus spending			0
the only spending cuts he agreed to , the sequestration cuts , he had announced during one of the presidential debates " will not happen			0
" there seems to be a near invincible unwillingness by this president and his advisors to cut the size and scope of government			1
how then do conservatives negotiate the coming debt ceiling extension , especially when they control neither the @entity107 nor the @entity108 ? there is no easy answer , but perhaps they should begin by explaining to the @entity77 people " the politics of reality , " as @entity116 aptly defined conservatism			0
the recent elections seem to indicate that a majority of the @entity77 people want lower taxes for themselves but approve of the president 's increased spending programs			0
in the end , they can not have both			0
a vibrant and prosperous private sector can not coexist with a one - size - fits - all caretaker state			1
one relies on low taxes and limited government interference , the other on high taxes and government redistribution of resources			0
so @entity77 must choose between the two and conservatives must make that choice clear : higher taxes , higher spending and more government services , or opportunity and upward mobility with lower taxes and less government interference			1
the debt ceiling is just the first of many opportunities to bring this choice to the public			0
republicans should make it clear that they will fulfill our debt obligations in a responsible manner , but they will only give the president short - term debt ceiling extensions until we get this problem under control			1
if @entity7 does n't want to cut spending in a meaningful way he 's going to have to explain that to the @entity77 people every couple of months for the next four years			1
the purpose is n't to thrash the president and his party or be ideological shock troops , as @entity164 once warned against , but to hold a national education seminar on fiscal responsibility			1
@entity147 have not won the argument , and will not win it , when these fiscal deals are made behind closed doors before the strike of midnight			2
sunlight is the best disinfectant and so too in politics			0
republicans can win the argument by making a clear and cogent public articulation of the president 's spending problem and how the @entity77 people , especially the lower and middle classes , will be the ones to suffer as a result			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			2

@entity185 : national debt does n't look like a priority for president @entity7
@entity185 : @entity7 more concerned with his legacy rather than our economic well - being
he asks why the president is so unwilling to cut the size and scope of government
@entity185 : @entity147 should make it clear that it will fulfill our debt obligations in a responsible way
