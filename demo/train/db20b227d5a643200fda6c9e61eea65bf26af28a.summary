-- many women in @entity2 remain defiant after they put keys to ignitions friday to drive home a point : challenging the conservative @entity9 kingdom 's prohibition of female drivers			1
among the dozens of women in the country who challenged the status was well - known female @entity2 blogger @entity14			1
" this is only the beginning , " @entity15 said			1
sitting on the passenger side for her 15 - minute ride through @entity20 , @entity15 captured the journey on her cell phone while a female friend drove			2
" the whole idea behind the campaign was that june 17 is the start date			0
it 's not the only day			0
it 's the date when women will start to drive , " she said			1
fueled by @entity33 , a campaign demanding the right for women to drive and travel freely in @entity2 , women commanded streets and roads normally reserved for men			1
there are no specific traffic laws that make it illegal for women to drive in @entity2			1
however , religious edicts are often interpreted as a prohibition of female drivers			1
such edicts also prevent women from opening bank accounts , obtaining passports or even going to school without the presence of a male guardian			1
authorities stopped @entity55 , 32 , for driving a car may 21 and detained her the next day			0
she said she was forced to sign a form promising not to drive again and spent a week in jail			2
@entity59 has not been charged , but the case remains open , and she may be called back , according to human rights activist @entity61			0
her name has become a rallying cry for women demanding their rights			2
the " @entity33 17th june " @entity67 page includes a banner that reads " we are all @entity70 " and a quote from @entity72 stating that " the day will come when women will be able to drive			1
" @entity59 said before her detention that she was determined to speak out			0
" we have a saying , " she said			0
" the rain starts with a single drop			0
this is a symbolic thing			0
" the @entity33 campaign was expected to be a test of wills between the government and half of the nation 's citizenry			0
however , campaign organizers were explicit in laying out conditions for participants			0
women were told to adhere to full @entity9 dress			2
wave the @entity2 flag and plaster a picture of the king to show patriotism			1
it was best to have an international driving license if you planned to drive			2
and have a man with you			0
the campaign said it would not be responsible for any women who breached a list of 14 such principles			2
they were asked to show defiance but within societal confines			0
a @entity20 man who went out to document what would be an unusual scene in @entity2 said that the streets were typically empty for a friday morning but that there were many fewer police officers than in march , when online organizers had called for mass demonstrations			1
" i 'm thinking that the government is turning sideways , " @entity114 said			0
" they do n't want to see it			0
they do n't want to deal with it			0
" " it 's a disadvantage for us , " said @entity120 , who lived in the @entity121 once and got her driver 's license when she was 18			0
" it 's something that we want to do , and hopefully , it will happen , " she said after driving to a @entity20 restaurant with her friends and cousin			0
a @entity2 woman said her mother drove her and her sisters down @entity20 's main street thursday			1
the woman , who asked not to be named because she was worried about harassment and possible reprisals , said no one bothered them			0
" this is important for women here			2
this is one of our rights , " she said @entity143 , a @entity145 women 's rights researcher for the @entity146 and @entity147 , said the freedom of movement is a basic right			1
@entity2 , she said , is the only country that bans women from driving			1
strict segregation by sex means women in @entity2 ca n't travel without a male relative or take public transportation			1
ironically , many women are forced to hire expensive private drivers or taxis to get around , forcing them to be in the company of unfamiliar men , which , said activists , does not make sense from a religious standpoint			1
@entity143 said that what separates the latest campaign from other efforts to get women to drive is the degree to which it has relied on social media			1
women who got behind the wheel were encouraged to shoot videos of themselves			1
but @entity2 women face challenges , @entity143 said			1
" they 're up against society as a whole , " she said			0
" some women may even face harassment or pressure from their families			2
some women have clearly been in support , but others are saying they do n't want to ' shame			2
' " @entity188 , an opponent of female drivers , posted on @entity67 , " it is not a sin for women to drive but when women drive and disobey the @entity195 's guardians , that 's the problem , this is unacceptable			1
" @entity143 noted that some men have been supportive of their daughters , wives and sisters taking part in the driving campaign			0
@entity61 , speaking thursday from @entity204 , said he encouraged his wife to drive in @entity206 on friday			1
" i think after what the police and the interior ministry did to @entity55 , a lot of women became afraid , " he said			2
" the @entity212 has put a lot of police on the street			0
they want to send a message to all women			2
" but on friday , @entity2 women defied tradition , no matter how bumpy the road			1
@entity0 's @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

" this is only the beginning , " @entity2 blogger @entity14 says
an online movement encouraged @entity2 women to drive friday
religious edicts , not specific laws , bar women from a host of activities
women are *emboldened* to get behind the wheel
