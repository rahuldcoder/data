@entity0 -- actor @entity2 told a jury on monday that he is the rightful owner of an @entity5 celebrity portrait that hangs over his bed			1
it is of the woman he considers the love of his life , " @entity12 " star @entity9			1
@entity9 , who died of cancer in 2009 , bequeathed her art collection to her alma mater , the @entity15 ; the university is accusing @entity2 of stealing away with its @entity5			1
" the painting is mine , " testified the 72 - year - old actor , who rose to fame as the impossibly handsome star of the 1960s television soap opera " @entity23 " and the 1970 film " @entity22			0
" he admitted taking the portrait , a striking black and white print with ruby red lips and turquoise eyes , from a wall outside the bedroom of @entity9 's @entity33 condominium about a week after her death on june 25 , 2009			1
" i removed the painting a week or more after she died , " he testified			0
remembering @entity9 the portrait now hangs over @entity2 's bed at his @entity40 beach house -- just as it did from 1980 until 1998			1
over the heated objections of @entity2 's lawyer , @entity43 , the jury heard about how the portrait came to leave the beach house in the wake of the couple 's infamous " falling out " in february 1997			1
the love affair between two baby boomer icons hit an extremely rough patch when she walked in on him in bed with a much younger woman			2
" that person that was in her -- in your beach house at the time was 25 years old , right ? " an attorney for the university , @entity61 , asked			0
@entity43 's objection was sustained before @entity2 could answer			2
@entity61 persisted , asking if @entity9 was " furious			2
" " no , " @entity2 responded			2
" he added that she felt " pitiful and disgraced			0
" @entity61 pushed on , asking whether the portrait was hanging over his bed at the time			2
" it was , " @entity2 acknowledged			2
but not for much longer			0
@entity2 battling prostate cancer " about a year after the incident i asked her to keep the portrait with her , store it for me , because my young friend was uncomfortable with @entity9 staring at her , " @entity2 testified			1
@entity9 's response , according to his testimony : " i 'd like you to leave it there because i want to make her uncomfortable			2
" by the time @entity9 moved into her @entity0 condo in 1999 , she had possession of the @entity5 portrait -- as well as a twin print @entity5 created at the same time			1
@entity2 insisted they reconciled a couple of years later			2
" like so many of the facts in this case , the impetus for @entity9 's turn as a model for @entity5 is in dispute			1
@entity2 says @entity5 , an old friend of many years , approached him in 1980 , about a year after he started seeing @entity9			1
by then she was already famous for her role on " @entity12 " and that ubiquitous red bathing suit pin - up poster			0
@entity9 taken too soon but @entity61 has suggested another scenario			2
he says @entity5 approached @entity9 directly , at a luncheon at a @entity99 country club			1
both @entity2 and @entity9 attended the two - hour session at @entity5 's @entity102 studio , known as the factory			1
dozens of @entity106 photographs were taken , but there was n't much fuss			0
" it did n't take long , " @entity2 said			2
" doing her hair took longer than taking the pictures			0
" later , he said , he received a call to pick up the paintings and saw them stacked with several others , including portraits of @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity2 said he and @entity9 each received a painting as part of the deal			1
they carried them out and loaded them into a @entity126			0
and so , @entity2 said , he ca n't steal what 's already his			2
he also said it was his idea that @entity9 leave her art to the @entity15 , but that the @entity5 portraits were n't part of the plan			1
@entity2 : i failed @entity9 the university sued @entity2 first , demanding in 2011 that he turn over the portrait so it could be displayed with its twin			1
the actor countersued , in turn seeking a court order giving him a tablecloth @entity5 decorated with painted hearts			1
it is included in the @entity9 collection , but @entity2 insists @entity5 painted it for both of them			1
the other portrait , which differs slightly from the one in @entity2 's beach house , hangs in the university 's @entity149 in @entity151			1
@entity43 says the university 's insistence on possessing both portraits is financially motivated , but @entity2 just wants to pass the portrait on to the couple 's son , @entity156			1
that legacy brought the day 's most emotional testimony			0
@entity2 struggled to maintain his composure as he read a letter @entity9 wrote their son at christmas 2007 , after her cancer was diagnosed			1
she had wanted to make him a sculpture as a gift but was too weak to complete it			0
" @entity156 , " her letter began , " it is important that you know that not only on this @entity173 but in all that days since you were born and in all the years that follow , you , sweet boy , are the love of my life			0
my most special gift from @entity177			0
i look at life differently now since i became ill. i look at every day with appreciation and gratefulness			0
it changed my outlook knowing that life could be taken away so easily			0
there is a quote that has more meaning to me now and i hope you will be able to use it at 22 years old instead of 60 years old			0
' you do n't get to choose how or when you are going to die			0
you can only decide how you are going to live			0
' i do n't want any regrets because i waited too long			0
life is a miraculous gift and as your mother i want to guide you to appreciate yours			0
" @entity2 was the first witness to take the stand monday morning , followed by a high - end mover who handled both @entity197 when @entity9 moved into the condo in 1999			1
@entity199 , a television producer who worked with @entity9 on the reality show " chasing @entity9 , " occupied much of the afternoon and is expected to return to the witness stand on tuesday , when jurors will be shown video excerpts that include a trip with a celebrity auctioneer to a storage facility to view one of the @entity5 portraits , @entity9 's famous red tank suit and other memorabilia			1
