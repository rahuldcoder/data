@entity0 -- late last week , the leaders and finance ministers of the 20 biggest economies , the @entity2 , met in @entity6 for their annual media extravaganza			1
surprise , surprise , the @entity2 summit failed to allay anxieties about @entity12 -- and has left the whole world anxious that @entity14 might be the next @entity15 country to plunge into crisis			1
as usual , it 's very hard to see what could possibly be accomplished in an unwieldy format like this			1
taxpayers confronting the enormous cost must wonder : how on earth did this event ever come into being anyway ? a bit of history : thirty - five years ago , a president of @entity28 had a very good idea : in the mid- 1970s , the western world faced the first serious economic crisis since @entity32 : a spike in the price of oil that had sparked record unemployment and unusual inflation			1
cooperation between the big economies was necessary			0
unfortunately , the new leaders of the western world did not know each other as well personally as had the great postwar generation of @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and so on			1
yes , the leaders encountered each other at the @entity49 and other big useless crushes			1
and yes , sometimes they scheduled bilateral meetings to discuss particular pieces of business			0
but would n't it be nice if the leaders could just regularly sit down for a sequence of informal talk , no particular agenda , just get - to - know - you , hear what 's on your mind ? accordingly , president @entity62 proposed a new kind of summit for the leaders of the world 's six largest economies : two days at a location outside a capital city , to be followed by a bland communique that sent the message : " if we told you what we discussed at our confidential talks , then they would not be confidential talks , would they ? " the first meeting was held at @entity80 , some 25 miles outside of @entity81			1
by all accounts , the meeting was a great success			1
no , the leaders did not overcome their economic challenges			1
but they built new relationships , so much so that four leaders in particular remained close friends for the rest of their lives : @entity94 , @entity93 president @entity92 , @entity96 chancellor @entity95 , and @entity98 prime minister @entity97			1
the small summit was recognized as so useful that it quickly evolved into a permanent institution			0
yet almost as soon as the institution was created , it began -- as international institutions so often do -- to bloat from useful innovation into useless behemoth			0
the @entity80 meeting in november 1975 was followed by a meeting in @entity108 , @entity109 , in june 1976			2
at the behest of the @entity93 , @entity110 was added to the group , which thus became known as the @entity113			2
( the other six countries , by the way , were the @entity93 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity98 , @entity28 and @entity14			1
) the @entity110 addition was an excellent innovation			0
not so what happened the next year			0
in retaliation for the addition of @entity110 -- opposed by @entity28 , which was then engaged in a grudge match with @entity110 over independence for the @entity28 - speaking province of @entity126 -- the @entity28 demanded and got the addition of the president of the @entity129 at the third meeting , in @entity131 in 1978			1
as the meetings became a fixture on the annual calendar , the agenda for the meetings began to fill			0
the number of aides in attendance grew			0
the press coverage escalated : hundreds of journalists converged on the 1988 meeting in @entity143			2
with so many tv cameras eager for video , political entrepreneurs inevitably materialized to provide the video the cameras needed : counter-summits , political demonstrations , and so on			0
three thousand protesters convened in @entity143			0
security costs escalated correspondingly : to a then - astounding $ 30 million			2
@entity143 1988 was noteworthy as the last of the @entity155 summits			0
as the world moved into a new political era , the g - 7 summit elephantized in earnest			0
in 1996 , the leaders of the @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 were added			1
in 1997 , @entity165 joined the group , now renamed the @entity167 - despite the awkward fact that the @entity165 economy had shrunk to approximately the size of that of the @entity172			0
the @entity165 addition raised the question : if @entity165 , why not @entity175 ? and what 's with the whole " largest economies " thing anyway ? is n't that kind of ... stuck - up ? to respond to that concern , a new forum was created in 1999 : a meeting of the finance ministers of the 20 largest economies , called ( you guessed it ) the @entity2			1
during the financial crisis of 2008 , the @entity93 urged a summit of the heads of government of the @entity2			2
what was intended as an emergency summit instantly congealed into a recurring gathering , held in the late fall after the @entity167 meetings of mid-summer			0
if the @entity2 was intended to thwart demands for ever huger expansion of the @entity167 - it failed			0
beginning with the @entity200 summit hosted by @entity116 in 2000 , five poor countries were added to the g - 8 guest list : @entity202 was included as a permanent invitee , along with four rotating slots for countries like @entity206 and @entity207			1
and if you were already adding poor countries , should n't we add agencies that address poor country concerns ? in 2000 , the @entity214 gained attendance rights too			2
the 2001 meeting in @entity217 , @entity14 , was stage - managed by @entity14 's showman prime minister @entity218			1
he accommodated most of the leaders on luxury cruise ships in @entity217 harbor to isolate them from the violent protesters on the mainland			2
total costs for the summit were now soaring toward and then past the quarter - billion mark			1
in 2003 , @entity175 and @entity228 were added as temporary members : the group was now being called the @entity167 +5			2
the g - 8 +5 format quickly broke down however			0
at the 2004 meeting in @entity233 , @entity234 , the @entity93 invited 13 additional countries ( plus of course all those international organizations )			1
over successive years , additional international organizations would be added to the roster : the @entity239 , @entity240 , the @entity241 , and the @entity242			2
in 2010 , @entity110 hosted the @entity243 of world leaders ( in the rural setting of @entity246 , @entity247 ) , at the same time as the @entity2 finance ministers met in downtown @entity143			2
for the first time , costs pass the $ 1 billion mark mostly due to higher security expenses			0
but this experiment in folding the @entity167 ( plus 5 ! ) into the @entity2 failed			0
the two massive entities retained their distinctness , each separately growing bigger , costlier , and progressively more useless			0
at the 2010 g - 8 meeting , @entity28 proposed junking the g - 8 +5 format for a permanent @entity260 format : the core seven , plus @entity165 , plus @entity175 , @entity228 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity202 and 1 @entity263 country , so nobody will feel left out			1
that idea looks likely to be adopted in time for the 2013 meeting in the @entity98			0
by which point of course the original purpose of the meeting will have been lost under the layers of accreted uselessness			0
so sources close to @entity276 are reporting that the young @entity98 prime minister has had a brainwave : now that the @entity167 has swelled into a grandiose nightmare mobile @entity49 -- now that the @entity243 is evolving into a group very nearly identical to the @entity2 -- why not just junk the @entity281 or merge it with the @entity49 ( which would amount to the same thing as junking it ) ? then the leaders of @entity98 and other major countries could organize amongst themselves some informal talks , no particular agenda , just get - to - know - you , hear what 's on your mind ... coming up soon : the new @entity291 ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity294 .			1

in mid- 1970s , @entity28 president proposed informal meeting of leaders from six nations
in past three decades , @entity294 writes , the meeting has grown larger and larger
last week 's *g20* did nothing to allay anxieties about @entity15 crisis
with more countries added , costs rose , results *vanished*
