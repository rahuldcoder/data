-- golfer @entity1 has described a jibe aimed at him by @entity3 as " wrong , hurtful and inappropriate , " though the world no. 1 insists he wants to move on from their very public war of words			1
@entity3 apologized to @entity1 after making a remark about the @entity9 at a players ' dinner ahead of the @entity13 's flagship tournament -- the @entity12 at @entity14 that starts thursday			1
asked on stage whether he would be inviting @entity1 round for dinner during next month 's @entity18 replied : " we 'll be having him round every night ... and serving him fried chicken			1
" fried chicken is a common food in the @entity24 , but when used in references to african - americans , it often implies a negative stereotype			1
@entity3 and @entity1 have been at loggerheads since an acrimonious round during the penultimate day of @entity30 earlier this month			1
" the comment that was made was n't silly			2
it was wrong , hurtful and clearly inappropriate , " @entity1 said on his official @entity33 account			1
" i 'm confident that there is real regret that the remark was made			2
@entity30 ended nearly two weeks ago and it 's long past time to move on and talk about golf			0
" earlier on wednesday @entity3 released an apology via the @entity13 and used his pre-tournament press conference at @entity14 to reiterate his remorse			1
" i want to send out an unreserved apology , i did not mean to offend anyone , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" i was caught off guard by the question but do n't get me wrong , i understand my answer was totally stupid and out of place			2
" i ca n't say sorry enough			0
i would also like to say sorry to the @entity13 and my @entity51 teammates for taking the shine away from a wonderful dinner that we all enjoyed to that point			2
" finally and most importantly i want to apologize to @entity1 and anyone that i could have offended			1
i feel sick about it and truly , truly sorry			0
hopefully we can settle things down and move on			0
" as soon as i left the dinner i started to get a sick feeling			2
i did n't really sleep at all			0
i felt like my heart was going to come out of my body			0
" it was tough to hit a shot ( in the pro-am ) without thinking about it			0
" @entity3 said he had spoken to the head of the @entity13 @entity70 and the @entity71 to apologize and subsequently will not face any punishment			1
his comments came at a dinner to honor the 12 members of @entity77 's victorious @entity51 team , whose dramatic comeback in @entity79 to defeat the @entity9 team that included @entity1 has been dubbed ' the miracle of @entity82			1
' the 33 - year - old 's @entity51 teammate @entity83 , the 2010 @entity18 champion , later tweeted when asked about the fried chicken comments : " private / humor filled environment but he ( @entity3 ) should n't have said it # slip			1
" @entity90 comments woods and @entity3 have long enjoyed a fractious relationship that was again highlighted when they were paired together during the penultimate round of @entity30 earlier this month			1
@entity3 claimed he was disrupted during one of his shots after the gallery following @entity1 cheered as the 14 - time major winner pulled a club out of his bag that signaled his intention to go for the green despite being in the rough			1
@entity3 sliced his shot and made a bogey that saw him relinquish the one - shot lead he held at the time			1
after the incident @entity3 told reporters : " i think that i try to respect everyone as much as possible out there			2
i try to be careful what i do to make sure it does n't bother the other players			0
" woods responded by saying : " it 's not real surprising that he 's complaining about something , " prompting another provocative comment from the @entity117 : " that 's fine			1
at least i 'm true to myself			0
i know what i 'm doing			0
he can do whatever he wants			0
" woods went on to cement his status as the world @entity124 , winning the tournament by two shots with @entity3 eventually six back after he faltered on the notorious 17th island hole , which is surrounded by water			2
the row rumbled on into this week as @entity1 was asked at a press conference whether he would consider contacting @entity3 to end their spat			1
" no , " came his brief response			0
upon hearing that , @entity3 hit back by reportedly telling a function in @entity136 : " he called me a whiner			2
it 's also probably the first thing he 's told you guys that 's true in 15 years			0
i know what he is like			0
you guys are finding out			0
" @entity3 's remarks are similar to those made by two - time major champion @entity90 in 1997 after @entity1 won @entity148			1
@entity90 suggested at the champions dinner the following year @entity1 would choose to serve fried chicken to his guests			1
he later apologized and claimed the remarks had been taken out of context			0
at his own press call ahead of the @entity12 , @entity155 , @entity3 's @entity51 teammate , refused to be drawn into the row saying he was friends with both players			2
" it 's an awkward situation where they obviously just do n't get on			0
it 's in the public ( domain ) and you guys ( the media ) will stoke it up and you do n't need to , " he told reporters			0
" i do n't think @entity1 will be particularly bothered			2
i get on with both of them but i have no interest of getting in the middle of that relationship			0
it 's nothing to do with me			0

@entity1 calls jibe aimed at him by fellow golfer @entity3 ' wrong ' and ' hurtful '
@entity3 had said he would serve fried chicken to @entity1 if he was to host him for dinner
@entity117 denies his comment was meant as racial jibe towards @entity181
the pair have been *arguing* publicly since acrimonious round earlier in may
