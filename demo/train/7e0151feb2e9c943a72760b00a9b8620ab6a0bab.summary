-- @entity1 could not believe his eyes			1
the man he saw in a @entity5 courtroom last week was stooped and shackled , hardly the same smooth and swaggering @entity6 who had told his story so many years ago			1
to say the author and the convicted killer have a history would be an understatement			1
if anything , their first face - to - face meeting in 35 years was anticlimactic			2
" he looked like a shadow , " @entity1 said of @entity6 , now 68 , who some believe the author betrayed for his 1983 best - selling book " @entity19			1
" " he has a pallor , there was no substance to him , " @entity1 continued			1
" i guess many years in prison can do that to you			0
" @entity1 testified earlier this month for the prosecution at a federal hearing in @entity30 , @entity5 , that could determine whether or not @entity6 deserves freedom , or at least a new trial			1
@entity6 's lawyers assert that newly - discovered dna evidence -- three hairs that match neither @entity6 nor any of the victims -- and the secondhand confession of a key witness who claimed to be at the family 's home the night of the murders justify reopening the case			1
judge hears new evidence in ' @entity19 ' case @entity1 said in court that he considers the latest defense maneuver to be " the @entity48 , " @entity6 's last chance at freedom			1
he remains convinced of @entity6 's guilt			1
the attorneys finished their closing arguments on monday , and the decision is now in the hands of @entity57 district judge @entity56			0
the judge could let @entity6 's murder convictions stand , toss them out , or order another trial			1
it is expected to take weeks , perhaps months , before a ruling comes in a criminal saga that has made headlines for four decades			0
it began when military police officers were summoned to the @entity6 home at @entity69 , @entity5 on february 17 , 1970			1
inside , they found a horrific crime scene			0
@entity6 's pregnant wife , @entity72 , was stabbed 16 times with a knife and 21 times with an ice pick			1
daughter @entity77 , 5 , was bludgeoned and stabbed in the neck			0
@entity79 , 2 , was stabbed 48 times ; a finger was nearly severed as she tried to fend off the blows			0
" it was overkill , " said @entity1 , who wrote that @entity6 killed his family in an amphetamine - fueled rage			1
@entity6 , a captain assigned to the @entity87 , also sustained a collapsed lung and two stab wounds in what he said was an attack on his family by a trio of intruders , including a woman in a floppy hat who chanted " acid is groovy " and " kill the pigs			1
" the word " pig " was written in blood on a headboard , a detail reminiscent of the infamous 1969 @entity105 family murders in @entity106			0
prosecutors alleged @entity6 staged the crime scene			2
the @entity109 investigated first , and @entity6 was cleared at a closed military hearing			2
but his father - in - law pushed civilian authorities to pursue the case and a grand jury indicted @entity6 in 1975			2
he was found guilty of murder four years later and is serving a three life sentences			0
if his appeal fails , he does not become eligible for parole until 2071			2
@entity6 has always insisted he is innocent , so the recent developments in the case come as no surprise to @entity1			1
" he 's a psychopath			0
he does n't have the kind of emotions that you and i would have , " the author said			2
" he does n't have the capacity to feel badly about it			0
these were n't his wife and children			2
these were people that got in his way			0
" @entity6 's appeals received renewed attention with the release this month of the book " a wilderness of error : the trials of @entity6			2
" written by @entity142 - winning documentary filmmaker @entity143 , the book paints @entity6 as a man wrongly convicted on the basis of incomplete and corrupted evidence , as well as prosecutorial misconduct			1
" we 've been sold a bill of goods about this case , " said @entity143			0
" it 's as phony as a three - dollar bill			0
" writer seeks to clear @entity6 asked about the controversy , @entity1 was pragmatic in his response			1
" it does n't matter what i think of what @entity143 thinks , " he said			0
" @entity6 was convicted by a jury in a court of law			1
he 's not in prison because of me and he 's not going to get out of prison because of @entity143			0
" @entity1 also tried to put the rest the notion that he was a passionate believer in @entity6 when he embarked on " @entity19			1
" he says he was embedded with the defense team because he was looking for a different angle			0
" i thought it would be fascinating to write about the trial from the point of view of how the defense and defendant were experiencing it			0
i learned everything from the first time in court			2
i did n't have my mind made up			0
" @entity1 said what he heard in court was overwhelmingly convincing			1
" there came a point in the trial when much to my dismay i started to feel this evidence is piling up and @entity6 is n't doing anything to dispute it			2
by the end it was still very confusing			0
i said to myself , ' i think this guy did it , ' but he was so charismatic and likable and had such a strong personality			0
this was before i learned about the psychopathic personality			0
" @entity1 also disputed the notion raised by the defense and @entity143 that the prosecutor at the criminal trial threatened witness @entity201 to alter her testimony			1
@entity201 , who died in 1983 , had admitted to others that she was present for the killings but she denied it on the witness stand at @entity6 's trial			1
watching @entity6 in court again reminded @entity1 of how much has changed in the three decades since he last laid eyes on him			1
" it was in 1987 during the trial of the civil suit against me , " @entity1 said			2
" he was allowed to wear a new suit of clothes			0
he looked like the host of a daytime game show			0
" in the civil case , @entity6 accused the author of breaching an agreement to write a book about his innocence			1
the jury deadlocked and the case was settled out of court for a reported $ 325,000			2
journalist @entity225 wrote a widely read article about the case and was critical of @entity1 , accusing him of deceiving @entity6 by pretending to believe he was innocent after becoming convinced of his guilt			1
@entity1 now has another controversial book out , " @entity228 , " a biography of @entity230			2
in court , @entity6 literally seemed to @entity1 to be a ghost from the past			1
" the years since have not treated him kindly , " he said			0
" he sat there at the end of the table and was whispering			0
" i looked at him but he would never look me in the eyes			0
