@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 leader @entity3 is poised to become the next prime minister of economically embattled @entity1 , with his ascension assured after the ruling @entity8 's candidate conceded sunday 's national election			1
@entity10 made the concession before a somber audience of @entity8 supporters -- a stark contrast to the raucous , celebratory crowd gathered outside the @entity4 headquarters in @entity0			1
less than 30 minutes later , @entity3 offered " a message of confidence " and vowing to push for " solidarity " in the wake of sunday 's vote			1
he did so in a televised speech inside a quiet room before coming out minutes later to address the boisterous crowd			0
" the @entity1 people have expressed themselves , they 've done so clearly , " he said in the first address			2
" and we 'll now embrace this change			0
" as detailed on the @entity31 website , with 100 % of the votes counted , the @entity4 had over 10.8 million votes ( 44.6 % of the total votes ) and captured 186 seats in parliament			1
that compares with just under 7 million votes for the @entity8 , giving it an advantage in 110 legislative contests			1
a party had to win 175 seats in order to win an outright majority in the 350 - seat chamber			1
the majority result , thus , paves the way for @entity3 's unfettered ascension to prime minister , giving him a free hand to set policy without having to first make deals with other parties			1
the outcome makes @entity1 the latest country to lose a government amid the @entity59 - wide money crisis			1
earlier this month , the leaders of @entity61 and @entity62 resigned over their own countries ' debt woes			0
in the closing days of the campaign , the 56 - year - old @entity3 had spoken repeatedly about the nation 's deep economic crisis , such as the sobering 21.5 % unemployment rate overall -- including a 45 % rate of unemployment for young people			1
nearly 5 million working - age @entity1 are without a job , and the country faces a steep public deficit and only tepid economic growth			1
some immigrant workers are also leaving the country			0
entering the elections , voters told @entity2 the economy was their top priority			2
" this vote will determine the future of the country for years to come , " @entity81 , a university researcher , said after voting at the @entity83 school in central @entity0			0
in his initial speech sunday night , the @entity4 leader said he would not forget those suffering -- from recent university graduates who ca n't find jobs to small business owners struggling to stay afloat to those hit hard by illness or other tragedies -- as he shaped policies			2
" we 're going to try our best to better their situation , " he said			0
" and we 'll think of them before making a decision			0
" @entity3 has said he would not cut pensions -- which the incumbent @entity8 government earlier froze , to much criticism -- but he says all other issues are on the table in order to reduce the deficit			1
he has also said he 'll consider tax cuts for businesses to encourage them to hire more workers			0
a cabinet minister between 1996 and 2004 under conservative prime minister @entity112 , @entity3 twice lost to @entity8 leader @entity113 , in 2004 and 2008 , in his first attempts to become prime minister			1
but his conservative party swept to victory in regional and local elections last may , presaging what polls had long accurately predicted would be a triumph the third time around			2
@entity113 called the early election and announced he would not seek a third term			0
while other parties and candidates were in the race , @entity3 's chief challenger had been @entity10			2
the 60 - year - old served under former socialist prime minister @entity128 and most recently under @entity113 , rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and interior minister			0
@entity10 had warned that the conservatives would cut into public health and education , the social programs which he said the @entity8 would fight to preserve , despite the economic crisis			2
about 35 million @entity1 are eligible to vote , of whom the government claims 1.5 million are first - time potential voters , having turned 18 since the last general elections in 2008			1
the economic protests across @entity1 during the past six months have been fueled by the young -- the so called ' indignants ' -- but it was not clear how much impact the protesters had on the results sunday			2
@entity146 , a university student in his last year of journalism studies and who has been active in the protests , said : " i think it 's necessary to vote , but that 's not enough			0
people feel the elections wo n't change the situation			1
they wo n't stop the cutbacks			1
" @entity146 , 25 , sees his own prospects of getting a job after college as bleak			0
" i think there 's a pent - up rage			2
the workers and young people of this country are fed up , " @entity146 said			0
" it 's been years of frustration , over cutbacks and lower salaries			0
" putting the @entity169 nation on the right track wo n't be easy , @entity3 admitted in his speech to celebrating supporters later sunday night			1
but the incoming prime minister stressed he felt it was possible , especially if @entity1 joined forces to work toward a common goal			0
" that 's what it 's all about -- to be together , everybody , ( and ) work together , " he told the crowd			0
" our political project invites all @entity1 who want to resolve this situation			0
it means a lot of work , a lot of effort and a lot of unity			2

new : the @entity4 wins 45 % of votes and 186 legislative seats , giving it a majority
@entity3 says *overcoming* @entity1 's economic woes requires " a lot of effort and a lot of unity "
the @entity8 candidate conceded , so his party wo n't rule for first time since 2008
the economy was the top issue , with nearly 5 million working - age @entity1 without a job
