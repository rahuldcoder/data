-- the number of children living with @entity2 is slowing down in areas of the world that typically account for the most new infections , the @entity1 on @entity2 said tuesday			1
that 's proof , organizers said , that a program it created to get antiretroviral medications to pregnant women is working			1
the program is known as " the @entity14 by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive			1
" it was created by a joint effort between @entity19 and the @entity22 president 's @entity20			1
the initiative targets 22 countries that account for 90 % of the world 's new pediatric infections			2
the program gives antiretrovirals to pregnant women who are infected with @entity2 in those countries			1
the medicine prevents the transfer of the virus to their babies			0
seven countries in @entity36 -- @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 -- have reduced the number of new hiv infections among children by 50 % since 2009			2
@entity2 discovery ' will change your life forever ' @entity42 showed the most remarkable progress			0
the number of new pediatric infections there fell by 76 % since 2009 , according to a new report on the program			2
@entity39 had a 63 % decline			0
in @entity39 and @entity41 , transmission rates between mother and child are now below 5 %			0
" the progress in the majority of countries is a strong signal that with focused efforts , every child can be born free from @entity2 , " said @entity60 , @entity19 executive director			0
" but in some countries with high numbers of new infections progress has stalled			2
we need to find out why and remove the bottlenecks			0
" one of the problems may be the small number of women who take antiretrovirals when breast - feeding			1
the report shows only half of all breast - feeding women living with @entity2 or their children receive these medicines to prevent mother - to - child infection			1
there is also an urgent need to improve early hiv diagnosis in children , according to @entity19			0
the goal of the program is to reduce mother - to - child transmissions by 90 % and to reduce the number of @entity2 - related maternal deaths by 50 % by 2015			2
" now we must all continue working together to see the day when no children are born with @entity2 , " said @entity22 global aids coordinator @entity92			1
this goal , he said , is clearly " within our reach			0
" could condoms change the world ?			0

a joint @entity22 - @entity106 program *distributes* antiretrovirals to pregnant women
more breast - feeding mothers need to take the medication , organizers say
