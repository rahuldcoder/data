the @entity0 did n't think @entity1 could survive , stuck in a 25 - foot sailboat for days as waves swelled 15 to 20 feet high			1
" i do n't feel like he 's dead , " @entity5 told a @entity0 official nine days ago , after learning their search was ending			2
" i do n't feel it			0
@entity1 was picked up tuesday morning about 64 miles ( 103 kilometers ) south of @entity10 , " weak , hungry and dehydrated " and -- most importantly -- alive			1
his rescue came 12 days after he made his first distress call , a difficult stretch even for a veteran fisherman			1
but he was n't beaten up enough to lose his priorities			0
according to his son , the 67 - year - old @entity1 told his rescuers , " we ai n't leaving without my boat			1
" so the sailor and his boat headed back to shore wednesday			2
what will his dad do now that he 's back on land ? will he relax , take some time off , maybe look for a less dangerous profession ? " i 'm sure he 's going to go fishing as soon as he 's able , " @entity5 said by phone from @entity27			2
" son : @entity1 is tough , strong , resourceful some people in their late 60s might be enjoying retirement or , at least , reining it in a few notches as life slows down			1
not @entity1 , whose son describes him as resourceful , physically strong and tough			1
" you know who @entity38 is ? " @entity5 joked			0
" @entity38 has a picture of my dad on his wall			0
" fishing is his life and livelihood			2
@entity1 lives on his boat and " that 's pretty much all he 's got , " his son said -- explaining his insistence his battered vessel , which he named @entity52 , be towed back to shore			1
he set off solo around @entity55 from @entity56 on what should have been a normal trip , like many others he 'd made over the years			2
it did n't turn out that way			0
he made distress calls on the holiday , indicating his boat was taking on water			1
those calls spurred a search that would end up covering 12,000 square miles			0
it included an @entity68 , an @entity70 airplane and the 110 - foot @entity71			0
but none of them could find @entity1 or his boat			1
' @entity75 ; small boat , in danger of sinking ' on december 1 , the @entity0 called off its search			2
@entity5 said he was told that airplanes , but not satellites , picked up his father 's emergency beacon -- suggesting it either had a weak battery or his boat was submerged			1
with rocky seas , the weather was n't cooperating either			0
" with the conditions the way they are , we could n't find your dad 's boat , " @entity5 recalled a @entity0 official telling him			2
" we think it 's sunk			0
" in fact , @entity1 's boat was still afloat			1
and on tuesday , he decided to give the distress call one more try			1
his life depended on it			0
" this is a mayday , mayday , mayday , " said @entity1			1
" ... small boat , in danger of sinking			2
" the @entity0 heard the call and immediately dispatched the closest available boat -- the @entity108 , a @entity110 destroyer , then about 14 miles away			1
they found @entity1 's masts broken and him using an auxiliary sail trying to get closer to land , his friend and fellow fisherman @entity111 told @entity118 affiliate @entity117			1
and , of course , there was @entity1 himself -- weary and battered , but still going , much to the relief of his friends and family			1
' i was going backwards all night long ' it all started , @entity1 said , when a simple plan to get food and water before dark one night went awry after the weather took a turn for the worse			1
" i tried all through the night			0
... i could n't make it			0
i was going backwards all night long , " he told @entity118 affiliate @entity135 / @entity134 after his rescue			0
at one point , a massive wave crashed into his sailboat			0
the boat mast hit the water , @entity1 said , and so did he			1
" but i had a rope on me ( and ) towed myself back in , " @entity1 said			2
from there , he had no choice but to go where the current took him			0
searchers had struggled to find him because weather pulled him hundreds of miles away from the area where they 'd been looking , he said			0
" i was way out there , and i was out of water , but i hydrated on fish , " he said			2
" i 'm a fisherman , so i caught fish			0
" " it was n't as a good as a sushi bar , " he said			0
but it was how he survived			0
" he 's alive after 12 days at sea , " his son @entity5 said			1
" i could n't be happier			0

@entity1 says he survived at sea by catching and eating fish
the @entity166 man made a distress call , 12 days after his first , saying his boat may sink
*authorities* tracked him down , finding him " weak , hungry and dehydrated "
his son predicts his father will resume fishing as soon as he can
