-- the viral @entity2 video has propelled the @entity3 and its leader , @entity4 , into the world 's spotlight and conscience			1
on @entity9 alone , more than 56 million people viewed it in its first four days			0
as the video created by @entity12 shows , the @entity3 has created an enormous human rights and humanitarian crisis in central and east @entity15			2
the @entity3 , which began as a rebel group in @entity17 , evolved into a brutal renegade force that has abducted tens of thousands of civilians , forcing them to serve as soldiers or sex slaves , has killed tens of thousands and has displaced more than 2 million in four @entity24 nations : @entity17 , newly independent @entity25 , the @entity26 and the @entity27			2
the message of the @entity2 campaign is simple : arrest @entity4			1
but the campaign also sets out what the @entity32 government needs to do , in partnership with other members of the international community and civil society groups in @entity15 , to make this happen			2
our organization , the @entity39 , joined with two advocacy groups , @entity12 and @entity42 , to send president @entity43 a letter on how to move toward ending the @entity3			1
the @entity32 must commit to keeping on the ground the military advisers that it deployed to @entity15 a few months ago and providing diplomatic , logistical and intelligence support to efforts by governments in the region to make sure the advisers can succeed			0
right now , the administration has a critical window of opportunity : the advisers are in the field and an initiative of the @entity59 is taking shape			0
president @entity43 should reach out personally to @entity24 and @entity62 leaders and lead a diplomatic surge aimed at finally bringing an end to this 25 - year crisis			1
the @entity32 military advisers are by no means a simple , stand - alone solution			0
for them to have an opportunity to succeed , the administration must ensure they have the necessary partner forces , capabilities and equipment			2
this means the @entity32 should : secure more capable forces from an @entity24 nation , such as @entity77 or @entity78 ; provide intelligence and transportation support , especially helicopters ; and get additional support from the international community			0
the @entity32 must urge regional governments to increase their commitment			0
in particular , the @entity17 army -- the best - equipped military of the countries affected by the @entity3 -- has already deployed many of its most capable troops to @entity91 to combat the terrorist group @entity92			1
it is planning to send even more there , at the expense of their commitment to combat the @entity3 elsewhere			0
the @entity43 administration should also work rapidly to resolve the impasse between the governments of @entity17 and the @entity26			1
as seen in the recent spike in @entity3 attacks in @entity26 , @entity103 's insistence that the @entity17 army no longer operate there is causing the country to become a safe haven for the @entity3			2
civilian protection must be prioritized and improved dramatically			0
the @entity32 must also monitor the human rights abuses and natural resource exploitation of the @entity17 military and other militaries and insist on accountability for any crimes committed			0
the administration needs to keep @entity32 advisers in place until they can succeed			0
in the region , 20 civil society , human rights and religious groups in areas affected by @entity3 violence ( @entity26 , @entity25 , and the @entity27 ) have welcomed the advisers , and they hope the @entity32 will fulfill its promises			1
a military campaign to apprehend the @entity3 's top leaders and protect civilians is necessary but insufficient			1
military operations alone simply can not capture all the @entity3 's commanders			1
even if @entity4 and a few additional leaders are captured , others will take their place			0
therefore , the @entity32 needs to lead the international community in developing and implementing a defection strategy that encourages @entity3 commanders , including senior and mid-ranking commanders , and rank - and - file fighters to leave the group			2
increased radio programming should be used to encourage defections and to sensitize communities so that @entity3 combatants who do defect no longer have to fear being attacked by local populations			0
the @entity32 and others in the international community must work closely with civil society leaders in the region and make a long - term commitment to rebuild and reconcile communities affected by the @entity3			1
millions of people in northern @entity17 , @entity26 , @entity25 and the @entity27 are counting on increased and sustained engagement by the @entity32 and others			0
the @entity43 administration should immediately pursue a diplomatic surge and additional initiatives to make 2012 the year that all communities plagued by the @entity3 can begin to recover and rebuild			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 and @entity160 .			1

@entity159 , @entity160 : @entity2 video spotlights brutal @entity4 and @entity3
they say it 's an opportunity for @entity43 administration to make push to end the 25 - year terror
they say administration should *bolster* military , civil , equipment *assistance* , stem *recruits*
*writers* : create way for @entity3 members to safely defect ; help affected communites recover
