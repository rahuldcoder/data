@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 on thursday would not say the @entity1 is at war with @entity3 , telling @entity4 in an interview that the administration 's strategy includes " many different things that one does n't think of normally in context of war			1
" " what we are doing is engaging in a very significant counterterrorism operation , " @entity0 told @entity4 's @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13			1
" it 's going to go on for some period of time			0
if somebody wants to think about it as being a war with @entity3 , they can do so , but the fact is it 's a major counterterrorism operation that will have many different moving parts			1
" @entity0 made a distinction between isis and terror groups operating in @entity26 and @entity27			2
" @entity3 is an animal unto itself , " he said			0
" and it is significantly such a threat because of the foreign fighters that are attracted to it -- which you do n't see in @entity26 or ... @entity27			0
" most importantly , @entity0 said , @entity3 has attracted a " significant coalition " that is determined to go and destroy it			1
@entity0 , in @entity12 for meetings with @entity41 leaders to enlist regional support for a coalition to defeat @entity3 , defended the administration 's insistence that the 2001 authority to go after @entity47 and affiliates applies to @entity3			1
he insisted that , despite the split between jihadist groups , the origin of @entity3 as an @entity47 affiliate is enough to consider them connected			0
" this group is and has been @entity47 , " @entity0 said			0
" by trying to change its name , it does n't change who it is , what it does			0
" asked how much of the interpretation lets @entity62 get away from a vote on going after @entity3 -- a scenario lawmakers would like to avoid in an election year -- @entity0 responded " none			1
" @entity0 said the opposition battling the regime of president @entity69 in @entity70 has been outgunned and outmanned , but the administration believes that equation can change " if they receive proper training , if there are recruits that come in , and if it grows over a period of time			2
" the regime 's legitimacy could never be restored , @entity0 said			2
" it is going to be our policy to separate ( @entity69 ) , who is mostly in the western part of @entity70 , in a certain corridor from the eastern part of @entity70 , which he does n't control , " @entity0 said			2
" @entity3 controls that part			0
so it is clearly ... not a very difficult task to target @entity3			0
" the talks in @entity12 come a day after @entity1 president @entity92 outlined a plan to " dismantle and ultimately destroy " the @entity95 extremist group that has seized a swath of territory across @entity98 and @entity70			1
videotaped beheadings , including two murders of @entity1 journalists , have led to the push for a broader counterterrorism mission , including possible airstrikes in civil war - torn @entity70			0
but the @entity1 has ruled out sending @entity1 troops for a ground offensive			0
on thursday , @entity0 met with @entity13 foreign minister @entity108 in @entity12 before wider talks with other regional leaders			1
asked whether @entity13 supports the extremist expressions of the @entity113 version of @entity114 espoused by some terror groups , @entity0 told @entity4 that the nation is " deeply committed to the effort to terminate @entity3			1
" " they have never funded the kind of effort you 're talking about with respect to @entity3 , " @entity0 said , adding that a significant part of the counterterrorism effort will include stemming fundraising for terror groups			1
after @entity13 , @entity0 will visit @entity127 and @entity128 for meetings with senior officials , state department spokeswoman @entity126 said			0
in a statement after @entity92 's prime - time speech wednesday , @entity0 said the president 's strategy would succeed " because doing it with allies and partners is n't just smart , it 's strong			1
" @entity0 said his travels through the @entity139 and @entity140 over the coming days were an effort to " meet a unifying threat with a unified response			0
" while @entity1 leadership is " indispensable , " he said , " we can not destroy this group on our own			0
defeating this common enemy calls for a common cause , and we 're taking it on to succeed together			0
" @entity92 spoke wednesday with @entity13 's @entity151 , a senior administration official told journalists			2
" the @entity13 made very clear that they support this mission , they will join us in this mission , " the official said			0
the backing of @entity95 - dominated nations such as @entity13 , @entity159 and @entity127 will lend support to any campaign to contain the spread of @entity3			0
@entity127 's capacity or willingness to act may be limited by the fact that @entity3 continues to hold 47 @entity127 hostages seized from the northern @entity98 city of @entity168			1
so far , @entity170 - majority @entity169 has played the biggest role on the ground in northern @entity98 , where its militias have been helping @entity98 forces			0
@entity3 , which now calls itself the " @entity175 , " has said it is bent on creating an @entity114 " caliphate " in @entity98 and @entity70 where harsh @entity179 law governs every aspect of life			1
@entity98 leader : ' everybody 's on board ' @entity185 was the first stop on @entity0 's tour , where he met with @entity98 's new prime minister @entity188			1
in a joint news conference with @entity0 on wednesday , @entity188 said the international community had a responsibility to help defend @entity98 from the threat posed by @entity3			1
he also said @entity98 had worked hard recently to form an inclusive government where " everybody 's on board " to fight the militants			2
in a separate news conference , @entity0 said the @entity1 was already coordinating with some 40 other nations to provide humanitarian , military and other assistance to @entity98 to fight @entity3			1
the @entity1 has so far launched more than 150 airstrikes to weaken the militants in @entity98 , @entity0 said			2
@entity70 airstrikes @entity92 said wednesday that 475 more @entity1 military advisers will head to @entity98 , raising the total of @entity1 forces there to 1,700 for a mission originally described as limited			2
he also shifted $ 25 million in military aid to @entity98 forces , including @entity211 fighters in the north combating the @entity3 extremists			2
the aid could include ammunition , small arms and vehicles , as well as military education and training , @entity215 spokeswoman @entity214 said			0
it 's not clear how soon @entity1 forces will launch operations in @entity70			0
senior administration officials who briefed reporters before @entity92 's speech on condition of not being identified said airstrikes against @entity3 targets in @entity70 would occur " at a time and place of our choosing			1
" " we 're not going to telegraph our punches by being specific about the time and nature of the targets , " one official said , adding that " we will do that as necessary as we develop targets			0
" ' very difficult , long road ' @entity0 met with @entity159 's @entity240 in @entity159 before leaving thursday morning for the @entity13 seaside city of @entity12 , where he was scheduled to meet with the leaders of half a dozen @entity243			1
in addition to support for a military campaign against @entity3 , administration officials said the @entity1 would be looking to its @entity248 allies to crack down on @entity3 funding and stop the flow of foreign fighters , both seen as the lifeblood of the jihadist group			1
the @entity1 also wants @entity254 , particularly @entity13 , to counter @entity3 by helping to persuade other @entity95 to eschew its ideology			0
" it 's going to be a very difficult , long road to get there , but it 's something that the region and our partners in the @entity248 can play a really important role in , " a senior @entity215 official traveling with @entity0 said			1
" and there 's a number of different ways that they can do that , both in terms of just their relationships , in terms of their encouragement , in terms of their financial contributions , in terms of lifting the burden that the government here has			0
" after @entity13 , @entity0 will travel to @entity282 to attend an international conference on @entity98 , @entity215 spokeswoman @entity126 said			1
@entity92 will chair a meeting later this month at the @entity286 , where the global strategy is expected to be hammered out			2
@entity0 : ' @entity288 ' of nations will help fight @entity3 @entity47 battles @entity3 for global jihadist leadership			2

strategy has " things that one does n't think of normally in context of war , " he says
he says president @entity92 's strategy to quash @entity3 with the help of allies will succeed
" doing it with allies and partners is n't just smart , it 's strong , " @entity0 says of @entity92 's plan
