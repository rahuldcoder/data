@entity0 -- the good news is that the chances an asteroid big enough to destroy a continent or all of civilization will hit @entity9 this year are only one in 20,000 , a congressional panel learned tuesday			1
the bad news is the government needs to spend billions of dollars in coming years for new technology to prevent such a possible catastrophe , regardless of the low probability , experts told the @entity17			1
" the odds are very small , but the potential consequences of such an event are so large , it makes sense to take the risk seriously , " contended @entity18 , who directs president @entity20 's @entity19			2
current efforts to detect and analyze possible space threats like the meteor that exploded over @entity32 last month , injuring more than 1,000 people and causing millions of dollars in damages , have made progress in identifying the threats , @entity28 administrator @entity27 told the committee			0
welcome to the year of the comet he said scientists have identified 95 % of asteroids more than a half - mile in diameter -- the kind that threaten human existence if they strike @entity9 , like the six - mile - wide one believed to have wiped out dinosaurs 65 million years ago -- and found none on a collision course with the planet			1
however , the detection efforts have been less successful for smaller meteors still capable of causing major loss of life and damage , such as the one over @entity32			0
only 10 % of meteors more than 150 yards wide -- dubbed " potential city killers " by @entity18 -- have been detected , meaning more than 10,000 are out there without our knowledge , he said			0
if scientists detected a major asteroid headed for @entity9 now , it would take at least five years to develop an effective defense system to either alter its course or possibly destroy it , no matter how much money was spent , according to @entity18 and @entity66			1
while you were working : an asteroid flew by @entity70 plans to bolster detection and mitigation capabilities include an infrared sensor that would orbit @entity74 , as well as a laser system or other method to deflect any threatening meteor away from @entity9 , they said			1
" we really need to have space - borne assets , " said @entity66 of the infrared sensor that would cost more than $ 500 million			0
another @entity28 goal endorsed by @entity20 is to send an astronaut to an asteroid for the first time in history by 2025 , a project that would cost $ 2 billion , he said			2
asked by panel members about the effects of forced spending cuts this year due to the inability of @entity92 to agree on fiscal issues , all the witnesses described heavy impacts			1
" just about my every working moment these days is consumed with this topic , " gen. @entity95 , commander of the @entity96 , said about the spending cuts that took effect march 1			1
he added that " we are clearly less capable			0
" @entity66 noted that @entity28 's budget for detecting @entity102 has multiplied in recent years to reach more than $ 20 million in 2012			2
now , he said , @entity92 needs to at least maintain such funding to prevent stagnation or , even worse , atrophy			0
" this is really important and it has to be continuous , " he said			0
more space and science news from @entity1 @entity110			0

@entity17 panel hears that chances of a big asteroid strike are one in 20,000
despite low risk , the government needs to develop better defenses , experts say
forced spending cuts are *harming* *preparedness* , government *officials* say
it will take years to build an effective system to deflect a large asteroid away from @entity9
