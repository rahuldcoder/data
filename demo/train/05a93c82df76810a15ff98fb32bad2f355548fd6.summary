@entity9 gave the home side a 14th - minute lead when firing in his 24th goal of the season			0
and , within a minute , @entity1 had doubled their advantage when @entity15 set up @entity16 to tap home from just six yards out			1
but @entity5 refused to lie down and scored twice within six minutes in a frantic opening 45 minutes			2
first , @entity19 was given far too much space to turn and shoot home low into the corner of the net in the 23rd minute			0
then , just six minutes later , @entity5 remarkably drew level when former @entity1 midfielder @entity25 played the ball over the home defence for @entity28 to volley home			1
but the first - half scoring was still not over -- and @entity32 defender @entity31 put the home side ahead once again on the stroke of half time when he burst into the box to head home @entity39 's cross			0
that was the end of the scoring , but not the chances , and @entity9 should have added his second of the game after the break but somehow managed to hit the crossbar from just eight yards out			0
and any chance @entity5 had of getting back into the game was finally extinguished when @entity28 was sent off for a second bookable offence			2
the result moves @entity1 up to fourth place in the @entity51 table , six points behind leaders and rivals @entity54 but with a game in hand			1
meanwhile , @entity57 are through to the quarterfinals of the @entity59 after beating rivals @entity54 2 - 1 in a match marred by crowd trouble			1

@entity54 levelled just four minutes later when @entity68 also scored from the spot after @entity70 had been fouled in the area			2
however , @entity72 scored the winning goal 13 minutes from the end , firing home with a well - struck right - foot shot			0
police made four arrests before and after the match after trouble between rival fans which resulted in a teenage @entity54 fan being taken to hospital with a knife wound to his leg			0
