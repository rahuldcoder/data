@entity2 was in ruthless form in the opening set , holding his opening service game to love and then wasted no time breaking the @entity13 's serve in the next			0
@entity6 managed to open his account in the fourth game , but there was no stopping the @entity17 after that as he secured a double break in the sixth , before polishing off the set with trademark efficiency			0
the @entity13 started the second set more promisingly , holding his opening two service games and breaking @entity2 in between to establish a 3 - 0 lead			2

tennis aces feel like rock stars earlier in the day , @entity35 narrowly overcame @entity36 's @entity9 in an epic three setter 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 )			1
despite a spirited display , @entity9 's pre-match pessimism earlier in the week turned out to be well - founded , as the @entity40 eventually prevailed in a grueling encounter			1
@entity9 produced his best tennis of the week and there was little to choose between the two men in the first set as they traded some thumping forehands			0
but there were few alarms on serve as the set progressed and a tiebreak was the inevitable conclusion			0
@entity1 secured the first mini-break to go 3 - 1 up and soon extended his lead to 5 - 2			1
but @entity9 fought back , winning the next three points to level up at 5 - 5			0
but a miscued running forehand by the @entity56 handed @entity1 his first set point which he seized , attacking @entity9 's serve before delivering a deft drop volley			1
the first six games of the second set went with serve , but in the seventh @entity9 earned himself three break points			0
@entity1 managed to save them all , but an over-hit return at deuce handed @entity9 a fourth opportunity which , this time , he secured with a crosscourt backhand winner			1
@entity9 held his next service game to lead 5 - 3 and when @entity1 faltered again on his serve @entity9 took full advantage and ensured -- to the delight of a rapt crowd at the @entity4 -- that the match would go to a deciding third set			1
@entity1 started it the stronger , breaking @entity9 in the third game and looked as if he would close out the set and the match comfortably			2
but @entity9 claimed the 10th game to level the scores at five games apiece as the match headed towards a deciding tiebreak			0
@entity9 had the better of the early exchanges and opened up a 4 - 1 lead only for @entity1 to level things up at 4 - 4			1
the @entity40 then seized the initiative which saw him close out the tiebreak 8 - 6 and take the match to set up a 22nd meeting with @entity2			2
@entity1 has an impressive 14 - 7 head - to - head record against the 16 - time @entity90 champion , according to @entity91			2
