the grand jury investigating @entity2 's death in @entity3 , @entity4 , has spent months looking into the case			1
@entity2 , an unarmed black teen , was shot to death by @entity7 , a white police officer , on august 9			1
a grand jury weighing whether to indict @entity7 has several options from which to choose , ranging from finding no probable cause that a crime was committed to charging him with murder			1
with apprehension filling the air , @entity3 awaits ruling " the thing that 's in common is that @entity2 is dead and that his death was caused by the actions of officer @entity7 , " @entity16 , a law professor at @entity17 in @entity18 , said about the various options			1
" what changes with each one is really the mental state and the circumstances			0
" complete coverage on @entity3 according to @entity30 , spokesman for the prosecuting attorney 's office , the grand jury is focused on whether @entity7 should be charged with any one of several possible crimes , including first - degree murder , second - degree murder , voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter			1
here 's a look at those charges in more detail : first - degree murder this is the most serious of the possible charges			0
to prove first - degree murder , prosecutors would not only have to show that @entity7 killed @entity2 , which is not in dispute , but they 'd have to prove that he did so after deliberating on the matter			1
deliberation is typically proved by showing some sort of planning , although planning can take place within a relatively short period of time			0
if @entity7 is charged and then eventually found guilty of first - degree murder , he could face up to life in prison without parole , or death , if the death penalty is sought , according to @entity60			2
second - degree murder to prove second - degree murder , prosecutors would have to show that @entity7 knowingly caused @entity2 's death -- that he knew what he was doing was going to cause serious physical injury or death			2
according to @entity60 , if @entity7 is found guilty of second - degree murder , he could face up to life in prison with the possibility of parole			0
voluntary manslaughter voluntary manslaughter is the act of killing another person while under the influence of a sudden passion			0
if prosecutors can prove @entity7 acted while in a fit of anger or rage when he shot @entity2 , they might be able to secure a conviction on voluntary manslaughter			2
if they do , according to @entity60 , @entity7 's sentence could be from five to 15 years			0
involuntary manslaughter involuntary manslaughter is when someone causes the death of another by being reckless			0
he might not mean to kill the other person but did n't take the necessary precautions not to do so			0
if prosecutors can prove @entity7 did n't know what he was doing when he fired in the direction of @entity2 , they might be able to secure an involuntary manslaughter conviction			2
if found guilty , @entity60 said , @entity7 could be sentenced to no more than seven years in prison			0
no charges of course , it 's entirely possible that the grand jury will find there is no probable cause to charge @entity7 with anything			1
in this case , it would have to decide @entity7 was justified in shooting @entity2 -- perhaps he feared for his life or acted in self - defense			1
if the grand jury decided against an indictment , @entity7 would continue to be a free man , at least so far as the state 's criminal charges			1
federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations , one into @entity2 's killing and the other into the local police department 's overall track record with minorities			0
