-- throughout history , the greatest artists have relied on their muses to inspire , enchant and satisfy them			1
@entity5 immortalized mistress @entity6 in his 1937 painting @entity8 , @entity9 catapulted model @entity10 to " @entity14 " status in his 1960s avant - garde films , while @entity15 made the woman behind his " @entity17 " perhaps the most famous muse of all time			1
but the elusive figure of the muse does n't always have to be that of a beautiful woman			1
the dark beauty with flowing locks and sinewy limbs depicted in artist @entity28 's latest painting is n't a luscious lady -- it 's a horse			1
not just any horse , but arguably the greatest race horse of all time			1
since demolishing the field in his first major win at the @entity38 in 2010 , an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred @entity40			1
the superstar colt , who even has its own twitter handle , has not just won all 14 of his races -- he has won them by staggering margins , destroying world - class fields , becoming by a distance the top - rated race horse on the planet			1
in his last race , the thoroughbred won the @entity53 at @entity54 , with a sell - out crowd of 32,000 catching a final glimpse of the now - celebrity horse as as he powered to a dramatic victory			1
writer @entity66 's personal " @entity40 moment " came earlier in the horse 's stellar career , an experience which later paved the way for artist @entity28 to paint his unusual surrealist work			1
" i had been watching last year 's 2000 guineas race on tv when @entity40 just pounded the other horses into the ground , " said @entity66			2
" he easily won by a good six lengths -- none of the others even came close			2
" in my mind 's eye i saw @entity40 smashing through the screen into my living room ; this powerful , beautiful , almost mythical beast			2
" a 51 - year - old former solicitor from @entity80 in north - east @entity81 , @entity66 was so moved by @entity40 's win he wrote a poem about the centaur - like creature bursting into his suburban home in a blaze of glory			1
it read in part : " then a smell of burnt air mixed with horse - flesh when the telly exploded in his face as the @entity40 centaur burst in green and pink silk , fluid powerful grace			2
" it was a special sporting moment and had a profound effect on @entity66 , who described @entity40 's win as akin to watching boxer @entity101 or footballer @entity102 in action			2
" it was one of those rare times when you get a sense you 've just witnessed somebody or something at the very pinnacle of sporting prowess , " he said			0
" @entity113 words are never good enough to do it justice			0
" and so @entity66 enlisted @entity28 , a lecturer at the @entity116 in @entity117 ( @entity116 ) to paint the champion horse powering into a suburban living room , knocking @entity66 and his wife from their chairs and spilling their afternoon gin and tonics to the floor			0
" the result is a surreal cocktail of his words and my interpretation in art form , " @entity28 said			0
" the modern domestic scene is shattered by the magisterial beast that is @entity40			0
" @entity28 painted the work , called " @entity135 , " in egg tempura ; a mixture of colored pigment and egg yolk which dates back to the @entity140			0
the method , which gives a luminous quality , was later superseded by oil painting around the 15th century			0
" it has a kind of stained glass quality to it , like shining a light from behind , " said @entity28			0
" the pinks and blues of @entity40 's silks are quite strong and i thought they really lent themselves to the medium			0
" @entity28 is perhaps best known for his paintings of @entity81 football scenes , such as " @entity156 , " which captures the unusual tradition of @entity160 fans throwing celery , or " @entity162 , " which portrays sporting revelry in a pub. after saturday though , and @entity28 will be painting fabulous @entity40 smashing not just a tv screen , but the record books all over again .			0

from @entity5 's @entity6 to @entity9 's @entity10 , muses inspire great artists
but muses are n't always beautiful women -- sometimes they *'re* a horse
@entity175 inspires poem and painting *ahead* of last race
arguably world 's greatest race horse *secured* 14th win at @entity54 's @entity183
