-- a new look @entity2 got their @entity4 qualification campaign off to a winning start by beating @entity6 2 - 1 in @entity7			1
@entity8 gave @entity2 the lead in a tightly fought game that saw the @entity11 equalize in the second half thanks to a superbly taken goal by @entity14			2
but the irrepressible @entity8 scored again four minutes later and @entity2 held out before @entity6 were reduced to ten men late on			1
new look @entity2 it is barely six weeks since @entity2 won the @entity18 at the @entity19 in @entity20 , but already thoughts have turned to the @entity4 finals in @entity23 in two years time			1
yet @entity2 was missing many of the players that had featured in that famous @entity18 campaign , not least @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 who have all retired from international football			1
a recent 4 - 2 thrashing by fellow finalists @entity34 in a friendly last week -- @entity2 were 4 - 0 down at one point -- had raised fears that the transition to a new look team might be a painful one			1
@entity2 started strongly in the first half and took a deserved lead in the 18th minute when @entity8 looped in a header			2
a flourish of goals did n't follow			0
instead @entity6 , rejuvenated and unbeaten in six competitive games under coach @entity46 , worked themselves back into the game and were unlucky not to equalize when @entity50 striker @entity49 hit the post			2
but the equalizer did come eventually after @entity53 raced through on the left and calmly slotted the ball past @entity56			0
parity did n't last long as @entity8 scored the decisive goal and any chance of a comeback was snuffed out after a late @entity62 red card reduced the @entity11 to ten men			0
chance for the underdogs elsewhere in @entity67 it was a chance for the underdogs to shine			0
@entity69 , @entity67 football 's governing body , has changed the qualification format for the 2016 competition			0
it has been expanded to 24 teams , meaning that the top two in each group qualify automatically to the finals whilst third place might earn a play off spot			0
there has been much criticism of the move in @entity67 's established footballing powers for diluting the standard of the competition , but the change also opens the door to smaller teams who might not otherwise qualify			0
@entity89 grabbed their chance with both hands			2
the tiny @entity94 state beat a @entity95 1 - 0			1
@entity96 came back from a goal down to beat @entity98 2 - 1 after scoring twice in the last 10 minutes whilst the @entity100 islands looked on course for a shock win against @entity103 before the @entity104 scored three second half goals			1
@entity106 hammered there was no fairytale ending for @entity106			2
the tiny @entity110 overseas territory , @entity69 's smallest and newest member , was playing its first competitive match since being admitted last year			1
@entity106 's membership of @entity69 had become a political hot potato			2
the ownership of the territory is disputed by @entity117 , who claim @entity106 is @entity117 territory and have opposed any attempts to admit them in to @entity69			0
but the @entity120 successfully took their case to the @entity122 , allowing the national team to play in qualification for the first time in their history			0
although their match against @entity130 was supposed to be a home game , @entity106 's @entity127 does not meet @entity69 's standards and the match was moved to @entity95			1
after an impressive first half , @entity130 went into overdrive in the second			0
@entity138 striker @entity137 scored four times as @entity130 ran out 7 - 0 winners			1
monday sees current @entity67 champions @entity117 play @entity143 , @entity141 play @entity144 and @entity145 play @entity146 .			0

@entity2 beat @entity6 2 - 1 in @entity4 qualification
first competitive match since their @entity18 win
@entity89 shock @entity95 1 - 0
@entity130 thrash new boys @entity106 7 - 0
