@entity0 , @entity1 -- far from clarifying matters , the @entity1 @entity4 's guilty verdict against prime minister @entity5 has added several layers of uncertainty about the fate of @entity1 's civilian government and its longest serving prime minister			1
moments after @entity5 was found guilty of contempt for his refusal to revive old corruption charges against president @entity16 , politicians and political analysts on dozens of @entity1 's 24 - hour news networks offered a dizzying array of contrasting views on what the ruling meant			1
" it plunges the country into political and legal crisis , " said @entity24 , editor of the @entity26 political weekly , the @entity27			2
@entity1 's @entity5 convicted of contempt " in practical and legal terms it does not mean much , " said @entity31 , the head of an @entity0 based political think tank			1
" a lot of people were under the impression that the prime minister would be disqualified , but he is not			2
" for now , @entity5 remains @entity1 's prime minister and the new debate raging here is whether his conviction justifies a disqualification and his removal from the post			1
within hours of the verdict @entity5 's lawyer , @entity46 , held a press conference and cited @entity1 's constitution , which says a member of parliament can only be disqualified after a conviction and a prison sentence of at least two years			1
the @entity4 did not sentence @entity5 to time behind bars but delivered a symbolic sentence by keeping him in custody for the duration of the hearing which lasted only several minutes			0
therefore , " there is no automatic immediate disqualification , " @entity46 said			0
" the prime minister is not disqualified			2
" @entity5 's eligibility to remain @entity1 's prime minister will be decided by the speaker of parliament , and possibly the election commission , in a process that could take months			1
but @entity5 's political enemies are already calling for him to step down and no one 's screaming louder than @entity68 , a former premier who would love nothing more than to reclaim the post following next year 's parliamentary elections			1
" i think that after the conviction the pm should immediately step down from his post , " @entity68 told a reporters in a live news conference following thursday 's verdict			0
" this is a convicted prime minister			2
he has been found guilty , he has been sentenced by the @entity4			2
" @entity24 said @entity68 could decide to take the drastic measure of quitting parliament in protest if the prime minister refuses to resign , a move that would place the legitimacy of parliament in jeopardy and fuel a fresh political crisis			1
the contempt case against @entity5 stemmed from his refusal to ask @entity91 authorities to reopen old corruption charges against president @entity16			1
the charges date back to the 1990s when @entity16 allegedly laundered tens of millions of dollars while his wife , @entity95 , served as prime minister			1
@entity31 said the verdict failed to answer central questions about @entity16			0
" it has diverted attention from the real issue , " he said			0
" the real issue is if our president is guilty of amassing illegitimate wealth and money laundering			0
we have failed to arrive at any conclusion and we 're still perceived as a nation that does n't abide by the rule of law			0
" even so , @entity31 said the political drama is likely to continue , taking up precious time and resources in a country that is facing a myriad of crises including widespread poverty , a broken economy and the bloody fight against @entity119 militants			0
" this is just a waste of the nation 's time , " said businessman @entity120			0
" it 's just very disappointing			0

@entity1 's @entity75 found guilty of contempt for refusal to revive corruption charges against president
@entity5 , @entity1 's longest - serving prime minister , was not *jailed*
analysts believe it plunges the country into political crisis , while others think it means nothing
debate raging over whether it justifies a disqualification and his removal from the post
