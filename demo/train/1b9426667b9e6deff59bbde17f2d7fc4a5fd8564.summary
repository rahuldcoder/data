-- is a parent 's love for a child guaranteed ? let 's assume for a moment that it is and that parents love their children unconditionally			0
is it then possible to love your child but not to like them ? what about fear ? can a mother both love her child and also be in constant , mortal fear of them ? what about loyalty ? can a mother ever betray her child ? what is the proper reaction when one 's son commits a massacre at his high school ? these are some of the questions faced by @entity30 ( @entity31 ) with respect to her son @entity33 ( played by @entity34 as a toddler , @entity35 as a grade schooler and @entity37 as an adolescent , all to chilling effect )			1
presented in a back - and - forth , non-linear and occasionally all - too obvious way , @entity45 's " @entity42 " is the ultimate cautionary tale for prospective parents			1
as an infant , @entity33 screams constantly , to the point where @entity30 parks his stroller next to a construction site in an attempt to drown out the tyke 's wailing			1
alas , even the jackhammers are no relief and it 's only when being held by his father , @entity56 ( @entity56 ) that @entity33 relaxes			1
this is but a snapshot of what 's to come and how @entity33 will play mother against father in the coming years			1
as he ages , @entity33 is , to @entity30 and to the audience , if not to @entity64 , increasingly creepy			1
he refuses to be potty trained well into middle childhood and almost never smiles			0
he even shows a true malevolence , seemingly taking pleasure in making life difficult for @entity30 , while acting as @entity70 's little boy			1
according to flashbacks / @entity30 's memory , her husband is absolutely clueless when it come to their son , and the couple 's relationship is one of the aspects of the film that left me cold			2
@entity56 is kind of a ... dope , for lack of a better word			0
when she was younger , @entity30 was something of a free spirit who traveled the world in a rather @entity92 existence and short of an unplanned pregnancy , i could n't see anything in @entity64 that would have attracted someone like the young @entity30			2
yet here they are , married and living in the ' burbs , which is exactly where @entity30 does n't want to live			2
the situation serves to put @entity30 on edge , which she seems to have been since @entity33 's birth , and at one point she loses her temper , breaking his arm			1
while he covers for her with the doctor and @entity70 , it 's not in a good way but rather more an " i have dirt on you , @entity111 " way			0
by this time , @entity30 is more or less convinced that @entity33 is damaged goods and things only get worse when she decides ( without consulting @entity56 ) to have another child , perhaps in the hopes of getting it right , the second time			1
the resulting daughter @entity118 ( @entity119 ) is everything @entity33 is n't : happy , effervescent , playful and loving , a daughter both parents can love			1
of course @entity33 instantly hates her			2
" @entity42 " is full of hints and foreshadowing ( but considering much of the film is told as @entity30 's memory , it could just as easily be called " after - shadowing " ) and this is where i found most fault with the film			1
@entity45 's screenplay ( written with her husband @entity134 , from the novel by @entity136 ) is a little too obvious and the symbolism is laid on a bit too thick			0
repeated shots of @entity30 and @entity33 dunking their faces into water ( seen from under the water ) , a bow and arrow motif and the endless use of tomatoes , tomato soup , red wine and red paint as metaphors blood are beyond obvious , and the film can hardly be called subtle : the first time we see @entity118 , she has an eye patch			1
@entity155 , i wonder how she got injured ? @entity31 is indeed fantastic and given the long list of awards and nominations she 's been racking up for " @entity33 " over the past few months , i 'd say there 's a better - than - even chance of her picking up a second @entity162 nomination later this month ( she won an @entity162 for best supporting actress for " @entity164 " in 2008 )			2
@entity30 is a tortured soul			2
she knows @entity33 is a bad seed , and ca n't seem to fix it			0
she hopes loving him is enough , but she seems to know , deep down , that it is n't			0
then there 's the possibility that it 's her fault , somehow			0
was she a bad mother ? did she pass on some dormant genetic defect to her son ? @entity30 starts medicating her anxiety about @entity33 with wine and pills , shuffling her way through life in a state of near oblivion , all the while becoming a pariah in what is to her , the ninth circle of hell : the suburbs			1
the community blames @entity30 at least as much as she blames herself and this is another aspect of the film that bothered me			0
after what she 's gone through , it strains believability that an entire town would turn against her because of something her child did , no matter how horrific			0
far more a horror movie than a family drama , " @entity202 " is an uneven update on the " bad seed " story , kept afloat almost entirely by @entity31 's magnificent portrayal of a completely broken mother			0
" @entity202 " is rated r ( restricted			0
under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian )			0
the violence is more suggested than graphic but in context , that makes it all the more unsettling .			0
