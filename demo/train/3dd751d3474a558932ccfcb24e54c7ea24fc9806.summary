-- for all the complexity of our national complexion , @entity1 still too often think that white makes right			1
consider a new study of census returns reported on by the @entity8			1
it showed , apparently , that significant numbers of @entity11 are now identifying as white			1
the research was presented at the recent @entity14 meeting			0
some news reports suggested that @entity11 , rather than solidifying a distinct ethnic identity and becoming the driving force of a " majority - minority " future , might instead try to be just the latest group of immigrants , such as @entity22 or @entity23 , to " become white			1
" such a shift , if it 's real , has potentially big implications			0
think about national politics , where the @entity28 plays to a shrinking , aging and increasingly anxious base of white voters			1
if large numbers of @entity11 were to start thinking of themselves as white , that could alter the calculations and rhetoric of the @entity28			1
but it turns out such scenarios are at best premature			0
what the new research really appears to reveal is just how confused we continue to be about race -- and how , even amidst this confusion , whiteness remains a dangerously malleable idea that @entity1 must deal with more candidly			1
let 's start with the three points of confusion that @entity8 's report on the new research revealed			2
first , and most basic , is a statement that has been repeated yet ignored so often that it 's like the fine print in an ad : " hispanics can be of any race			0
" that means there are black , white , even @entity11			1
the label " @entity59 " -- meaning , " with origins or heritage in @entity63 - speaking countries " -- was intended by the census to be a category of linguistic and ethnic heritage , not an official " race " of its own			2
yet in recent decades , @entity11 or @entity69 have indeed begun to forge a cross-cutting identity that can feel like a racial category ( shorthanded as " brown " ) and is sometimes set beside the other major blocs of @entity1 's racial color grid			1
so @entity11 can be at once a race and not a race			1
it 's no wonder that media coverage of @entity11 can be muddled			2
the second point of confusion is that the new research did not in fact find a @entity59 flight to whiteness			0
what it found was that growing numbers of @entity11 , when told by government forms that they were not a race unto themselves and that they had to choose a race , chose the category called " white			1
" as the study authors noted , this reflected the convolutions and limits of the census forms ( which are to change in 2020 ) at least as much any underlying yearning among @entity11 to be white			1
but this brings us to the third point of confusion , which is that to the extent that some @entity11 did in fact want to be seen as white rather than @entity59 , they were using the clumsy language of color to express the subtle reality of class			1
an earlier @entity8 report indicated that the longer their families had been in @entity1 , the more likely @entity11 were to check the " white " box			1
this suggests that the way @entity1 say " upward mobility for immigrants " or " mainstream integration " is still too often " becoming white			1
" indeed , sometimes our national discourse on race proceeds as if it were all about groups of color vying to be acknowledged , while white people sit back and watch			2
the invention of panethnic categories such as " @entity123 " or " @entity124 , " categories that take on a racial life of their own , is in part a reaction to the white - norming of politics and pop culture			2
but it 's also a time - tested , all - american tradition			0
for proof , look no further than the invention of the white race itself			2
the great waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries -- to say nothing of the baroque rules of racial categorization in the slaveholding @entity144 -- showed that @entity1 have always been deviously flexible about deciding who gets to be white			2
at first the @entity146 were n't , then they were			0
same with the @entity22 and @entity23			0
in more recent times , @entity124 who 've achieved in visible ways have been granted " honorary white " status ( wanted or not ) , while some people of color seeking middle - class success have been accused by their co-ethnics of " acting white " ( whether they thought of it that way or not )			0
the great risk , underscored by the reactions to the new research , is that we go on unthinkingly treating whiteness as the ideal and social baseline of @entity165 life			1
that 's harmful because it subordinates people whose backgrounds are n't " white " and because it stunts the capacity of all people -- not least poor and working - class whites -- to name and reckon with class divides and inequality			0
i propose a better way of talking about what third - or fourth - generation hispanics , or ambitious new arrivals in @entity181 , or resilient @entity165 first - in - the - family college students are all doing			0
they 're not becoming white			0
and to become @entity165 is now a more colorful , complex and class - bound undertaking than it has ever been			0
let 's learn to see it that way			0
correction : an earlier version of this article misidentified the source of the new research reported on by @entity8			2
it was presented at the @entity197 meeting			0
share your stories of your modern family			0

@entity202 : @entity8 study of census data shows many @entity11 now identifying as white
**liu** : it could have implications in national politics , but mainly tells us about our views on race
he says longer @entity11 had been in @entity1 , more likely they were to check " white "
**liu** : danger in treating whiteness as ideal social baseline ; @entity1 is and should be colorful
