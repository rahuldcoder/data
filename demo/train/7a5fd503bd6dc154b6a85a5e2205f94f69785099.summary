sen. @entity0 grew hoarse on the campaign trail saturday			1
the @entity3 @entity2 had been shouting all week , rallying her supporters at campaign events up and down the state , fighting to hold off a challenge from @entity10 @entity9 rep. @entity8 to the bitter end			1
" the national race is over , but honey , our race is not over " she cried at a campaign rally on the eve of the runoff election			2
but there was every indication that nobody 's listening			2
saturday morning , when she arrives to vote , only four cameras are there to capture the moment , compared with what one staffer described as a gaggle 50 - strong during the november 4 vote			0
@entity0 has trailed in every public poll of the race			1
most recently , in a poll out this week from @entity10 firm @entity33 , she was down by 24 points			1
early voting among african - americans , a voting bloc key to her chances for a win , was down , but @entity10 early voting was up			1
with @entity10 locking down control of the @entity42 in the november elections , @entity3 lost some of its urgency for national @entity46			1
the @entity47 withdrew its investment early on in the runoff and left her to fend for herself , as did most of the major @entity46 spending groups			0
the lopsided fight frustrates @entity0 , who on friday , unprompted , chastised the @entity54 for having " abandoned us			1
" " i just do n't believe in leaving a soldier on the field , and that 's what they did , " she says			0
@entity0 tries to turn the tide even on saturday morning , @entity0 insisted despite the lack of support , she still had a chance , noting there 's a precedent for her to orchestrate an unexpected , come - from - behind win			1
" the first race i ran 18 years ago -- the same pundits said , the tide has turned , you can not win , no @entity2 can win in the @entity71			0
eighteen years ago they said that , and we did " win , @entity0 remembers			1
in 2002 , too , she pulled off a runoff win			0
then , like now , she seized on a niche issue -- then it was a trade deal that would hurt farmers in the state , now it 's a dispute over @entity8 's work for @entity81 -- to help boost her campaign in its last moments			1
but this time , @entity3 political observers say the issue broke too late for it to gain much traction			0
and the political tides have grown increasingly difficult for the senator during her time in office			0
the @entity71 has become increasingly red , and @entity0 is now the last remaining statewide elected @entity2 in @entity3 , and the last @entity46 senator in the @entity71			1
president @entity91 remains deeply unpopular in @entity3 , and republicans have successfully made the race a referendum on him , even as @entity0 focuses on her record			1
@entity10 candidate keeps low - profile in past weeks @entity0 confronts mission impossible still , it 's probably a good thing for @entity8 that few were listening to the race			1
the congressman has been described as " awkward " and " really weird " by the press and his detractors			0
he 's kept his campaign appearances to a minimum in the runoff -- spending nearly all of the last week of the campaign in @entity111 -- to reduce the chances , many speculate , that his unusual personal style could stymie his near - certain win			0
that style is on full display during one of his two final campaign rallies on friday			0
out front of the event , he escalates to an unexpected , gleeful shout while thanking a supporter for voting for him			0
telling a reporter that the reason @entity10 have gained so much strength in the @entity71 is the fact that " they 're the party for working families , " citing the @entity10 's support of the @entity132 as an example , and he points a finger to the sky and raises his chin as though sermonizing			1
deflecting a question on why he has n't been in the state all week , @entity8 tangles himself in the kinds of knots that have wound up in @entity46 attack ads. " it is the story that i 'm doing my job as a congressman -- because people want to question me as to whether or not i 'm doing my job as a doctor -- i 've always shown up wherever i 've been asked to be			2
and when i show up where i 'm asked where i 'm supposed to be is now a story ... because people ask me what , " he says			0
@entity8 pauses , then adds : " you see the paradox			2
" asked about the evaluation made by others of his personal style , @entity8 brushes them off as unfounded bias from reporters who " read what other reporters have said and they write what the other reporters have said			2
" @entity8 takes @entity166 off democrats are already starting to look past her loss saturday toward 2016 as an opportunity to right the ship			2
@entity172 , the senator 's brother and mayor of @entity175 , told a group of reporters friday night that as soon as they start focusing on 2016 , the " environment is going to start changing all across @entity9			0
" " on monday morning , the whole story 's gon na be different , " @entity172 promised a group of reporters during @entity0 's friday night event			2
he later added , " there 's always another day			0
" @entity184 : jazz and politics in the ' zombie runoff '			0

@entity189 projects rep. @entity8 will defeat sen. @entity0
some polls had her down by as much as 24 points to her @entity10 challenger
