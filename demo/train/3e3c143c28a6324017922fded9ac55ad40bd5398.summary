-- when @entity2 gave his now - famous , 80 - minute interview on the plane back to @entity5 from @entity6 , he was asked , not surprisingly , about the role of women in the @entity9			1
he said that @entity14 had " closed the door " to the possibility of women priests , but he affirmed that the church lacked " a deep theology of women			1
" his comments conveyed a deep respect for women			2
whatever @entity2 ' own virtues , however , the church will continue to be accused of sexual discrimination , especially by many @entity22 and @entity23 , as long as it denies the priesthood to women			1
no matter what efforts @entity2 makes with respect to women , if he refuses to move the ordination question forward , many , including @entity9 , will consider his efforts toward women as insufficient or even hypocritical			1
that @entity14 " closed the door " to women 's ordination is undoubtedly true , but the door may not be closed for all time			0
after @entity14 's pronouncement against the ordination of women , the @entity40 , the country 's leading professional society of @entity9 theologians , at its june 1997 meeting , endorsed a resolution indicating that there are " serious doubts regarding the nature of the authority of the teaching " that the church lacks the authority to ordain women to the priesthood and that the all - male priesthood is a truth that has been infallibly taught and that the faithful must accept			1
what we learned about @entity2 in @entity6 the resolution continued that " there is serious , widespread disagreement on this question not only among theologians , but also within the larger community of the @entity9 , " and recommended it be given further " study , discussion and prayer			1
" but the ordination of women is not the most pressing question for most @entity9 or even for most @entity9 women			2
women also experience discrimination and exclusion in the secular sphere in the @entity22 and @entity23 , but their exclusion and discrimination in the developing world are far greater			0
throughout the world , women and their children make up the greatest percentage of human beings living in destitution			0
their main concern is not women priests but food , health , education and physical safety			0
@entity2 ' genuine concern for the real lives of the poor and suffering warmly embraces women			2
pope @entity2 is charting new territory			1
i do n't know how pope @entity94 acted out his self - understanding of the pope as the " @entity97 " -- the humble designation he first used -- in the sixth century , but clearly @entity2 sees himself as a leader who is committed to serving			2
many commentators have pointed out his letting go of the material trappings of hierarchy and exclusion , from @entity106 shoes to papal apartments , and they have commented favorably on his compassion for the poor , his desire to lead all the faithful to a discipleship of service			0
@entity2 clearly sees himself as a disciple , and wishes to set an example like that of his namesake , from @entity117 , who said , " @entity119 , using words when necessary			0
" opinion : what do pope 's remarks on gays mean ? will @entity2 advance the conversation regarding the ordination of women ? i suspect he will not			1
but i think his behavior toward all , from the most powerful to the least , but acting very explicitly without judgment and with love and compassion on behalf of the least -- most of whom are women -- will " open the door " to future conversation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			0

@entity140 : pope @entity2 says @entity9 needs " deep theology of women "
but she says many will accuse church of discrimination as long as it denies women priesthood
she says jury still out : by some theological readings , women not *precluded* from priesthood
@entity140 : his warm stance toward women in church bodes well for taking on issues of *poverty*
