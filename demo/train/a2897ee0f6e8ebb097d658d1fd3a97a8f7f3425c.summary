@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 and the @entity5 share principles of unity and tolerance and both can benefit from strengthened ties that will bolster trade and combat terrorism , president @entity3 said in a highly anticipated speech wednesday			1
the address at the @entity14 was considered a highlight of @entity3 's two - day stop in the southeast @entity18 nation where he spent four years of his childhood			1
as the nation with the largest @entity22 population in the world , @entity1 was chosen as the site for @entity3 to further address @entity5 relations with the @entity27 world following his speech on the topic last year in @entity30 , @entity31			1
he referred specifically to the @entity30 speech of june 2009 , noting he called there " for a new beginning between the @entity5 and @entity22 around the world -- one that creates a path for us to move beyond our differences			2
" " i said then , and i will repeat now , that no single speech can eradicate years of mistrust , " @entity3 said			0
at the same time , he promised that " no matter what setbacks may come , the @entity5 is committed to human progress			0
" @entity5 " is not , and never will be , at war with @entity27 , " @entity3 insisted			2
" instead , all of us must defeat @entity46 and its affiliates , who have no claim to be leaders of any religion -- certainly not a great world religion like @entity27			0
" @entity1 has been rocked by terror attacks such as bombings on @entity55 in 2002 and 2005 , and @entity3 noted the nation 's progress " in rooting out terrorists and combating violent extremism			1
" however , @entity22 staged rallies across @entity1 on sunday to protest the @entity5 president 's visit , and about 20,000 people attended the demonstrations , a spokesman for a protest group said			1
" we do n't see the differences between @entity3 and ( former @entity5 president @entity68 ) @entity68			1
they both have blood on their hands , " said @entity70 , a spokesman for the @entity22 group @entity71			0
" that 's why we reject @entity3 and we do n't believe that he 's reaching out to @entity22			2
" in his speech wednesday , @entity3 reflected on his years in @entity1 , referring to how he and his family were warmly accepted			2
he got cheers when he sprinkled sayings from the local @entity81 language , such as " @entity82 " -- a greeting of welcome -- and the national motto " @entity85 , " which means " unity in diversity			0
" noting that @entity81 is one of hundreds of languages of the archipelago nation , @entity3 lauded @entity1 for its spirit of inclusiveness despite its diverse population and history of dictatorship			1
" but even as this land of my youth has changed in so many ways , those things that i learned to love about @entity1 -- that spirit of tolerance that is written into your constitution , symbolized in your mosques and churches and temples standing alongside each other ; that spirit that is embodied in your people -- that still lives on , " he said			0
now , @entity3 said , he returned as the @entity5 president seeking " a deep and enduring partnership " with @entity1 , " because as vast and diverse countries ; as neighbors on either side of the @entity116 ; and above all as democracies -- the @entity5 and @entity1 are bound together by shared interests and shared values			1
" " @entity5 has a stake in an @entity1 that is growing , with prosperity that is broadly shared among the @entity1 people -- because a rising middle class here means new markets for our goods , just as @entity5 is a market for yours , " @entity3 said			1
the @entity5 leader called for @entity1 's continued development and warned that would require " a refusal to tolerate the corruption that stands in the way of opportunity , " along with a commitment to transparency and protecting the freedom being honored on the @entity142 holiday wednesday marking @entity1 independence			0
" our nations show that hundreds of millions who hold different beliefs can be united in freedom under one flag , " @entity3 said			0
" and we are now building on that shared humanity -- through the young people who will study in each other 's schools ; through the entrepreneurs forging ties that can lead to prosperity ; and through our embrace of fundamental democratic values and human aspirations			0
" @entity2 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
