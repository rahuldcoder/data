@entity0 -- the star of the show did not appear -- and the film in question was not shown -- but @entity7 's big - screen moment was all the talk tuesday at the @entity9			1
the @entity9 is tackling a @entity11 case involving a movie about @entity7			1
the justices heard arguments in a free - speech case over a 2008 documentary , shown in theaters , that was sharply critical of the onetime presidential candidate and current secretary of state			1
at issue was whether the 90 - minute " @entity7 : the movie " and television ads to promote it should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or should have been seen as a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech			1
the high court 's decision will determine whether politically charged documentaries can be regulated by the government in the same way as traditional campaign commercials			1
a ruling is expect by late june			0
a conservative group behind the movie wanted to promote it during the heat of the presidential primary season last year , but a federal court had blocked any ads , as well as airings on cable tv video - on - demand			1
the film later aired in several theaters and was released on dvd , outlets that were not subject to federal regulation			0
the @entity9 justices appeared divided on how to find balance between @entity51 ' expressed desire to control the power of well - financed private groups to spread their political messages and concerns over the @entity11 's guarantee of free speech			1
" this is targeted at a specific candidate for a specific office to be shown on a channel that says @entity65 ' , " said justice @entity64			1
" now if that is n't an appeal to voters , i ca n't imagine what is			0
" " there 's a possibility , " said justice @entity71 , " that the @entity11 interest is greater when what the government is trying to stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say something , but also a listener who wants to hear what the speaker has to say , " noting that viewers would have paid to see the film on cable television			1
on its web site , @entity85 promoted its film as featuring 40 interviews.as well as a " cast to end all casts			0
" it promised , " if you want to hear about the @entity92 scandals of the past and present , you have it here ! ' @entity7 : the movie ' is the first and last word in what the @entity95 want @entity97 to forget ! " the group , a @entity0 - based nonprofit corporation and advocacy organization , had balked at campaign finance rules that would have required them to disclose their financial backers and would have restricted when the film could air			1
the film was partially financed with corporate funds			0
a three - judge @entity108 panel last spring rejected the group 's arguments that the documentary was more akin to news or information programs such as @entity115 ' " @entity114 " or @entity117 ' " @entity116			1
" during tuesday 's oral arguments , the justices seemed uneasy about arguments from both sides			1
" this sounds to me like campaign advocacy , " said justice @entity122			2
but attorney @entity125 , representing @entity85 , said the law " smothered " free speech			0
he said groups like @entity129 ( which owns @entity130 ) , @entity131 and progressive financier @entity132 ( who often privately funds his political projects ) could air such films in the name of informing the @entity97 people , but not his clients because of the film 's perceived negative tone			2
" if it 's all negative it can be prohibited , and it 's a felony			0
or if it 's all favorable , you can go to jail			0
but if you did half and half , you could n't " be convicted , said @entity147 , criticizing the law 's " incomprehensible " regulations			0
several on the court wondered whether a 90 - minute message was different than a 30 - second commercial			2
" it seems to me you can make the argument that 90 minutes is much more powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate , " said justice @entity156			2
" we have no choice , really , but to say this is not issue advocacy , this is express advocacy saying do n't vote for this person , " which is subject to regulation , " @entity122 said			0
" the difference between 90 minutes and one minute is a distinction that i just ca n't follow			0
" the comprehensive 2002 @entity173 law bans broadcast of " electioneering communication " by corporations , unions and advocacy groups if it would be aired close to election dates and would identify candidates by name or image			0
the law also requires an on - screen notice of the groups financing such ads , as well as public disclosure of all donors to the sponsoring organizations			2
lawyers representing the @entity191 urged the justices to subject the ads to the disclosure law , arguing that without it , voters would be " unable to know who 's funding the ads. " @entity200 attorney @entity199 called it " an easy case			1
" some on the bench were not sure , probing the limits of the definition of candidate advocacy			2
" so if @entity209 airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action figures for sale , come buy them , that counts as an electioneering communication , " asked chief justice @entity208			2
justice @entity216 wondered about the differences between broadcast or cable tv , where the film could not be run , and the @entity221 or theaters where it could			0
when @entity199 implied " additional media " could also be subject to future regulation , the newest justice replied , " that 's pretty incredible			0
you think that if a book was published , a campaign biography that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy , that could be banned ? " most book publishers are corporations subject to campaign finance restrictions , he noted			1
legal observers say @entity216 and @entity208 ' votes could be key to the case 's outcome			2
at the time of the movie 's premiere , @entity92 was locked in a tough primary fight with then - sen. @entity242 for the @entity244 nomination for president			1
critics slammed her qualifications and character			0
people say , " well , she 's flipping , she 's flopping			0
no , she 's not flipping and flopping , she 's lying , " @entity252 , a political commentator and regular analyst for @entity1 , said in the film			2
" we must never understate her chances of winning , " warned @entity256 , a former political adviser to president @entity92			1
" and we must never forget the fundamental danger that this woman poses to every value that we hold dear			0
you see , i know her			0
" ads for the movie were available on the @entity221 , which is not subject to federal regulation			2
" i 've seen this movie , " justice @entity269 wryly noted , " it 's not a musical comedy			0
" @entity272 , head of @entity85 and producer of the " @entity7 " film , was also behind several conservative documentaries , including a rebuttal to @entity279 's @entity278 film " @entity280			1
" the case is @entity85 v. @entity191 ( 08 - 205 ) .			1
