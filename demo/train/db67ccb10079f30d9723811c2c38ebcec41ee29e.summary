" it 's great news that i 'll be on track , " the 31 - year - old said			0
" i 'm really looking forward to getting back to work and helping the team as much as i can			0
" i 'll be taking part in the two sessions to give the team my input on the new parts we 're bringing to those races , and i 'll be working closely with the race drivers and the engineers on track to help everyone get the most out of the new package			0
" i 'm physically ready to get back into the car and i know my experience can help give the team new ideas and options for directions to take on setup and strategy			0
" @entity1 made his @entity2 debut in 2007 and went on to win his first race in @entity44 as a @entity46 driver the following year before moving to @entity7 -- then called @entity47 -- when they joined the grid in 2010			2
but the @entity1 lost his seat at @entity0 - sponsored @entity7 in 2013 because he was not a " pay driver " -- which meant he did not bring any money to the team			1
@entity7 hired @entity55 @entity54 from @entity56 rivals @entity10 and @entity58 rookie @entity57 for this season , but have fallen to 11th out of 11 teams in the constructors ' championship , behind @entity10 , after the first three races			0
the circuit : @entity0 's @entity2 interactive it is important to finish inside the top 10 because that entitles teams to a greater share of the sport 's revenue and prize money			0
@entity7 bosses hope new developments on their 2013 car will help them catch up on the @entity10 and close the gap on the midfield runners			1
but team principal @entity79 says that task relies on using the experience of @entity1 , who had been with the team since they first turned a wheel			2
" @entity1 has six years of @entity2 experience behind him so he is perfectly placed to provide us objective feedback on the various types of configurations we will run and to give us an objective view of the 2013 tires against his experience with the 2012 compounds , " @entity79 explained			2
" having invested in @entity1 for our first three years of competition it would be a waste not to leverage the valuable expertise he brings			0

" the restructuring of @entity7 's line - up means @entity104 -- who made history when he became the first @entity107 racer to drive in front of his home crowd during practice at the last race in @entity112 -- loses his role as the team 's reserve as well as his place in @entity7 's gp2 team			1
the 25 - year - old will stay on @entity120 's driver roster , but his role has yet to be announced			0

@entity1 's return to @entity2 coincides with discussions between tire supplier @entity133 and the sport 's chief @entity135 about the possibility of running young drivers on a new tire compound in first practice to give them vital experience in @entity2			1
there are five drivers -- @entity145 and @entity146 of @entity10 , @entity148 's @entity147 , @entity149 of @entity150 and @entity151 of @entity7 -- who joined @entity2 in 2013 with limited experience of driving an @entity2 car .			1
