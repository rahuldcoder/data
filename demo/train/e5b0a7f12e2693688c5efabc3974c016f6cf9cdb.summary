@entity1 president @entity0 opened his appearance at the @entity4 summit of world leaders in @entity6 with a speech that had to make @entity8 think			1
he also took a shot at @entity13 president @entity12 in his speech and later , after a sunday meeting , @entity0 and the leaders of @entity10 and @entity6 made a point of criticizing @entity13 's annexation of @entity18 and called for the prosecution of those responsible for the downing of @entity22 in eastern @entity23			1
the @entity1 is a big part of the power balance in @entity27 and plans to throw more of its weight onto the scale , the president told a crowd at the @entity32 in @entity33 on saturday			1
" we will continue to deepen our engagement using every element of @entity1 power -- diplomacy , military , economic , development , the power of our values and ideals , " he said			0
and the @entity1 will band together with nations in the region			0
it will work toward giving them more heft -- so that big nations do not " bully the small , " @entity0 said			1
that has been a common phrase used in reference to territorial disputes between @entity54 and other southeast @entity56 nations			1
@entity54 's relations with @entity58 and the @entity59 have soured over maritime tensions			0
but @entity54 's bitterest dispute has been with @entity10			2
military boats and planes have hummed around small , uninhabited islands that both countries lay claim to , heating up rhetoric and defense posturing between @entity69 and @entity8			0
in many of the disputes , access to underwater oil has been at stake			0
calling out @entity54 @entity75 stands for the @entity75 , and it is made up of 10 smaller @entity56 nations , most of them developing economies			1
@entity54 , @entity10 and @entity80 are not members			2
@entity0 singled out @entity54 , saying it would have to play by the same rules as its neighbors			2
" we 'll support @entity75 's effort to reach a code of conduct with @entity54 that reinforces international law in the @entity90 , " he said			0
and the @entity1 will reinforce its diplomacy with a balance of military might			0
" by the end this decade , a majority of our navy and air force fleets will be based out of the @entity98 , because the @entity1 is and always will be a @entity98 power , " @entity0 said			1
@entity100 plans to share oceangoing prowess with other countries , to find common ground in military interests with @entity58 and beef up its maritime capabilities			1
and @entity0 would like to see another large nation in the region step up as well			2
" we support a greater role in the @entity110 for @entity111 , which is the world 's largest democracy , " he said			0
" together , we can improve maritime security , upholding the freedom of navigation , and encouraging territorial disputes are resolved peacefully			0
" he also pledged to help make partners economically competitive and avoid development laden with pollution			0
the president repeated that the @entity1 was contributing $ 3 billion to the @entity121 to help poorer nations meet climate goals			0
he also had a message for @entity54			0
" the @entity1 welcomes the continued rise of a @entity54 that is peaceful and prosperous and stable and that plays a responsible role in world affairs , " he said			0
criticizing @entity13 the metaphor of big nations bullying the small has also been applied to @entity13 's annexation of @entity18 and its involvement in the armed conflict in eastern @entity23			1
as a result , the @entity135 nations booted @entity13 from its ranks			1
@entity12 received a frosty reception when he touched down for the @entity4 summit , though he did interact with several @entity141 leaders on the event 's first full day			2
that includes meeting with @entity145 prime minister @entity144 , @entity147 president @entity146 and @entity149 prime minister @entity148 , according to the @entity150			1
this comes against the backdrop of @entity154 's actions in @entity23 and elsewhere , responding to international criticism and sanctions not by backing down but instead by threatening to flex its military might			0
case in point : @entity13 defense minister @entity162 's announcement wednesday that his country plans to send long - range bombers to the @entity165			2
that has raised @entity100 's hackles , which says no present security concerns warrant such maneuvers			0
@entity0 , who focused almost solely on @entity27 , also threw out a new line of criticism to @entity154 in his speech , saying the @entity1 was leading the efforts " opposing @entity13 's aggression against @entity23 , which is a threat to the world , which we saw in the appalling shoot - down of @entity22			1
" the joint press release issued sunday after the @entity6 - @entity10 - @entity180 also took note of the @entity18 annexation and @entity22			1
@entity6 prime minister @entity183 has taken @entity12 to task over the downing of the plane over @entity23 's @entity188 breakaway region bordering on @entity13 , saying @entity154 owns some of the responsibility			1
in the leadup to the @entity4 , @entity154 deployed four naval warships near @entity6 , semiofficial @entity13 news agency @entity190 reported			1
one of the ships , the @entity194 , was once named " @entity23			0
" the agency said it was not uncommon for @entity13 warships to accompany the country 's leaders on foreign trips .			2

@entity0 and leaders of @entity10 , @entity6 criticize @entity13 president @entity12
@entity12 meets with the leaders of @entity145 , @entity147 , @entity149
@entity100 plans to shift naval and air force power to the @entity98 , @entity0 says
president wants to beef up @entity56 nations to avoid " bullying " by big nations
