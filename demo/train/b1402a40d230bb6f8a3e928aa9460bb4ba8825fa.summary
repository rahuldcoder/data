-- @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 got a good laugh from his audience of conservatives friday when he ribbed the @entity7 government for not using mail services , such as @entity9 , to track down the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the nation			1
he said the media did n't need to fact check him because he was engaging in " hyperbole			0
" well , it turns out @entity17 's suggestion was n't far from reality			1
in a lawsuit filed wednesday , two @entity19 allege that @entity22 agents were guilty of unreasonable search and seizure , and racial profiling when they arrested @entity19 nationals picking up a package at a @entity9 facility in @entity29			1
the package contained a passport mailed to one of them by the @entity19 government in the type of sting @entity17 was jokingly suggesting			1
" it is a practical reality that we have the technology that enables us to track -- between @entity41 and @entity9 , we track 24 million packages a day -- while they 're moving , and we allow you to find out where they are for free , " @entity17 told the @entity36 in @entity37			1
" that 's the world that works			0
now here 's the world that fails : the federal government today can not find 11 million illegal immigrants , even if they 're sitting still			2
now , i have a simple proposal : we send a package to everyone who 's here illegally , and when it 's delivered , we pull it up on a computer , we know where they are			2
" the lawsuit was filed on behalf of @entity63 , a @entity19 living in @entity65 , @entity29 , and her friend @entity66 , an undocumented @entity19 immigrant			1
it alleges that when the two 21 - year - olds drove to @entity9 in january 2010 , @entity22 officials arrested @entity66 and then went to the car where @entity63 was waiting , held her at gunpoint and separated her from her then 2 - year - old son , a @entity7 citizen			1
@entity66 was deported ; @entity63 , who was reunited with her child a few hours later , is fighting to remain in the @entity7			0
the incident unfolded after @entity9 employees inspected the package and alerted @entity22 officials that it contained a passport			1
at the time , a representative for @entity22 said the sting occurred because of concerns over document fraud			1
the passport was returned to the @entity19 government			1
@entity85 , an attorney representing the two @entity19 , said the lawsuit " challenges the interaction of private industry and the government in their attack on @entity92 immigrants in this country			1
" @entity95 said he did n't think the matter should be considered funny by anyone , especially conservatives			0
" there 's nothing amusing about the idea of government using corporate efficiency in order to violate people 's rights , " said @entity95 , who has filed a suit against @entity22 and @entity9 in @entity101 in @entity29			1
" this is a rank operation against a @entity92 group of people			2
these passports were lawful passports			0
there was nothing illegal about them			0
" he accused @entity22 of conducting warrantless searches of the packages			1
" @entity9 can do that , but the government can not , " he said			2
" much less @entity9 acting as an agent of the government			2
" @entity95 added that @entity22 also violated international law by limiting the @entity19 @entity126 's ability to get official documents to its nationals in the @entity7			1
" this is a free country			0
there should be a wall between the police function and corporate entities			0
corporations should not become police agents of the government , " he said			0
@entity9 senior communications specialist @entity139 said the company " has a long history of cooperation with law enforcement			2
we do not comment on the specifics of that cooperation			0
" he said he had no details of the case above and directed @entity0 to federal authorities			0
the @entity150 had no spokesperson available for comment			0
@entity17 told the @entity36 audience : " let me say for my friends in the news media that was hyperbole , and we do n't need a fact check			2
" turns out it was closer to the truth than he thought			0
@entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
