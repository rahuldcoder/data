-- nearly 4,500 @entity2 soldiers lost and 32,000 wounded			0
a trillion dollars of borrowed money to remove @entity4 and create an @entity5 that would not only be safe from possessing weapons of mass destruction but also friendly toward the @entity2			1
these are the @entity2 ' heavy sacrifices in blood and treasure			2
one can be forgiven for expecting some @entity5 support for @entity2 foreign policy aims in the region			1
on monday , the @entity16 - backed prime minister of @entity5 , @entity15 , met with president @entity17 at the @entity18 to express his thanks for liberating @entity5 from @entity4 and discuss next steps			1
the frosty news conference afterward told us that all was not well			0
tense , lacking in warmth and smiles and with public disagreement about @entity5 's neighbor , @entity28 , the appearance did not reflect a productive meeting			0
as the @entity2 formally ends the almost nine - year war and nears the end of its troop withdrawal , there is still much at stake -- and it 's not the relatively tiny @entity5 nation of 30 million people , but @entity2 influence and foreign policy objectives in the region			1
the @entity5 prime minister knows that his country , particularly his armed forces , is not yet ready to contain the probable outbreak of sectarian violence			0
and he wants @entity2 financial expertise in developing @entity5 's private sector			2
he made no secret of wanting greater @entity2 assistance on both fronts			0
@entity5 , under @entity15 , is keen to receive @entity2 help in countering terrorism and developing its economy			1
it seems perfectly legitimate , therefore , for the @entity2 to express its own expectations from @entity5			2
but what is the @entity5 response ? first , ending , or more precisely , containing the @entity59 - @entity58 conflict is a top priority of the @entity2 in the @entity61			2
@entity5 's support here would help bolster the @entity2 position			2
moreover , @entity5 could financially help @entity66 activists committed to a two - state solution			0
but while @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 recognize @entity58 , @entity5 continues to refuse to do so			0
second , the @entity2 and @entity70 have , mistakenly in my view , called for @entity28 's president , @entity73 , to resign			0
but @entity5 has defied the @entity2 and supported the @entity73 regime			2
when @entity4 killed @entity5 shias , @entity15 and others called for @entity2 support for removing the @entity5 dictator			1
but the same logic does not seem to apply for @entity15 and @entity5 today			0
forced to choose between the @entity2 line and @entity16 's support for @entity82 , @entity5 opted for aligning with the mullahs in @entity84			1
third , @entity5 is seen as an outsider among @entity59 nations in the region today because of its political ties to @entity16			1
under @entity4 , @entity5 was a buffer against spreading @entity16 's religious and revolutionary fervor			1
@entity2 attempts to isolate @entity16 and build regional support against @entity16 's nuclear weapons program are repeatedly scuppered by @entity5 's failure to support such efforts , much less lead it			1
in contrast , @entity97 ( for different reasons ) has been willing to support @entity2 initiatives to prevent @entity16 from developing a nuclear warhead			0
with @entity2 military and political presence inside @entity5 coming to an end and with the passage of time , @entity102 will become ever closer to @entity84			1
those who argue that the large and well - resourced @entity2 embassy in @entity5 will ensure that @entity102 is kept in check fail to remember that @entity84 , too , once had a powerful @entity2 embassy			0
unless political will in @entity5 exists to align with the @entity2 , @entity2 civilian contractors and a large embassy , much like in @entity115 , can not create allies			0
@entity15 's comments at the @entity18 , the trajectory of his government and the failure of the @entity17 administration to steer @entity5 away from @entity16 raises these important questions for the @entity2 : what does @entity16 offer that the @entity2 can not ? if after so much sacrifice , the @entity2 can not create an ally in @entity5 , then is it realistic to expect that @entity2 involvement in other nations ( @entity28 , for example ) will create @entity2 - friendly regimes ? most importantly , what is it about @entity2 foreign policy aims that make them so toxic for @entity5 ? if @entity2 foreign policy is so detached from the lived reality of the @entity59 world , is it time to reformulate policy so that they can be accepted by those for whom the @entity2 sacrificed so much ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			1

@entity142 : @entity2 spent vast blood and treasure on *ousting* @entity4 , building @entity5 ties
he says when @entity15 , @entity17 met to formally end war , things were tense
he says @entity5 still wants @entity2 help aid but *avoids* @entity2 foreign policy aims , has ties to @entity16
@entity142 : if @entity2 ca *n't* count on @entity5 by now , how will it hold sway in other nations in region ?
