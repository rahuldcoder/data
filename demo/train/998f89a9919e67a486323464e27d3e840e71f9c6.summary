@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 on tuesday led jubilant legislators and soldiers discharged under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy in singing " @entity8 " to celebrate the upcoming repeal of the controversial law			1
president @entity9 will sign the repeal bill on wednesday , and @entity2 did her part at the ceremony attended by hundreds of supporters of the repeal by signing the measure passed by @entity16 to send it to the @entity17			1
the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy enacted in 1993 banned openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service			0
more than 14,000 military members have been discharged because of it			0
@entity2 , a @entity24 @entity23 , said the military will be made stronger by including all @entity26 who want to serve without making gay and lesbian members lie about who they are			1
" is n't this a joyful day ? " she said , adding that the repeal measure will " change the law , improve the policy , make life better for many @entity26 , and make our country stronger			1
" @entity2 then asked all in attendance to sing " @entity8			1
" at the end , @entity38 rep. @entity37 of @entity39 , one of the first openly gay @entity17 members , could be seen wiping his eyes			2
earlier , @entity38 rep. @entity43 of @entity44 told the gathering of an e-mail he received from a company commander in @entity48 , who mentioned how he often had to counsel soldiers who received divorce papers or " @entity52 " letters from spouses or opposite - sex partners			1
@entity43 continued : " this young company commander , this captain , on his fourth deployment , wrote in that e-mail saying , ' i never thought i 'd see the day when i got one of those letters myself			1
and i 'm sitting here at three o'clock in the morning in @entity60 , @entity48 , and i have no where to go because i happen to be gay , and i ca n't walk to the chaplain , and i ca n't go to a battle buddy , and i ca n't walk to my commander 's office , so i 'm sitting here cradling my 9 mm pistol thinking about blowing my brains out			2
but i read this article about this @entity71 war veteran named @entity43 from @entity44 that 's fighting for me , and it gives me hope			2
' " the repeal bill , a campaign promise by @entity9 , won @entity78 approval on saturday in the final days of the lame - duck session			1
the @entity17 passed it twice -- first as part of a broader defense bill that was blocked by @entity83 , and then in the separate measure passed by the @entity78			0
conservative republicans opposed the repeal , saying it would put too much stress on a military fighting two wars			0
however , defense secretary @entity90 and @entity91 chairman adm. @entity90 both called for a congressional repeal with a set phase - in timetable , warning that " do n't ask , do n't tell " could otherwise be abruptly overturned by the courts			0
under the repeal measure , the @entity95 will finish developing an implementation plan that rewrites policies , regulations and directives			0
once that potentially lengthy process is complete , @entity9 , @entity90 and @entity101 will each have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting military readiness and unit cohesion			2
after the certification , another 60 days will need to pass before the repeal is officially enacted			0
