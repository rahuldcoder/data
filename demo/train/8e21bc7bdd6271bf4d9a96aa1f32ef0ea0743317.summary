-- sharing is a wonderful thing -- when executed correctly			2
it 's super fun to share hugs ( when they are wanted , it 's important to note ) , delicious desserts and interesting , thought - provoking books but not so fun to share colds , stds and / or upsetting , possibly dangerous secrets			1
some genres of sharing , however , are a little less black and white			2
for example : when is it ok to share something rad i just found online ? am i being helpful by passing along / posting said tidbit , or am i slowly morphing into my addled mother , clogging my friends ' inboxes with poems about @entity23 , kitten gifs and , if @entity25 has a dark side , chain letters promising certain death if not passed along to 200 people within the hour ? ( we wish @entity25 were still active			1
... that was the only weapon in our arsenal			2
) it 's hard to tell in this expansive world wide web of ours , but certain tipoffs can be telling : 1			0
does anyone respond when you post your new favorite ukulele cover to @entity40 ? 2			0
when you whine about the declining quality of model - train - collecting literature on @entity43 , do you score any retweets ? 3			0
have you enjoyed any real , substantial human interaction in the past month or so ? if you answered " no " to any of these questions , you might be putting your precious pearls before swine			0
( and if you answered " no " to number three , you might want to go outside			0
maybe say " hi " to the mailman )			0
in order to reap the praise you so certainly deserve for your expert curating abilities , might we recommend hitting up one of these three social sharing networks instead of appealing to the masses -- you know , before your digital face becomes one that only a mother could love			0
@entity62 @entity63 is your name , and antique thimbles are your game			0
seriously , you 're just wild about those whimsical little doodads ! sadly , not a one of your pals is quite as ardently anti-finger - pricks as you			0
no , they 're all about the sports and the shorts , the fun and the sun , and you with your porcelain skin ( and porcelain pointer covers ) much more prefer quiet contemplation and hot tea sipped whilst making those creepy @entity81 dolls with no faces			0
fret not , dear @entity63 , there are kindred spirits out there , just waiting to ooh and ahh over your daisy - emblazoned babies			0
where ? well , on @entity62 , of course ! if you have n't heard of @entity62 -- locked away in your cave of mothballs and yarn -- it 's a 2 - year - old social bookmarking site			1
users can create online idea boards of sorts , all centered around categories like art , home decor , technology and more			1
boards are themed ( " @entity107 , " " @entity108 , " " tattoos to get on my forehead " ... ) and populated with media collected during one 's online travels			1
the best part of the service , however , is that " social " factor : you can follow friends ( from @entity40 and @entity43 ) and other users who share your interests , as well as " re-pin " , " like " and comment on posts that tickle your fancy			1
finally , dear @entity63 , you 'll get the respect you deserve for that trove of thimble snaps you 've been hoarding on your hard drive ! and no , you do n't have to like antique thimbles to join @entity62			2
this was merely an example			0
@entity127 oh , @entity129 , you indie - band savant ! you 're always so up on the latest viral videos zipping around the @entity132			1
i mean , @entity144 's " @entity143 " was your favorite jam before that other band covered it using one guitar , and when that vid hit the @entity132 , you were super angry that the original tune 's integrity had been jeopardized by what you deemed a " straight - up stunt " ( you were the first one to share that video , too )			1
still , your friends have yet to recognize your video - finding genius -- so behind the times they are that they 're just now discovering that " @entity149 " video and they still think @entity150 is funny			0
we pity them too , @entity129 , and no , we ca n't understand why your band , she 's a @entity155 ( @entity156 , @entity156 ) , has yet to take off , either			2
we know that no one will every truly understand you , we get it , but we think you 'll be able to find some kind of solace in @entity127 , a video - sharing site that 's a lot like @entity62 in some respects			1
the site allows users to create " categories " of videos and share them with other users			1
so , dear @entity129 , you can create a cache of " @entity171 " vids or " songs that think they 're about anarchy			1
" or , you know , " videos of @entity176 , " if you 're so inclined			0
as with @entity62 , you can also follow other users , re-posting , commenting on and expressing your emotions ( via a series of emoticons ) about their videos			2
the site even has a chat feature , so , friend @entity129 , you do n't have to limit your rants and raves to the confines of a mere comment box			1
this is my jam oh , @entity193 , we know you were dumped ... mostly because @entity40 tells us that you listened to " @entity194 " by @entity195 70 times in a row on @entity198 ( that jam is one of the top breakup tunes , the @entity132 tells us )			2
you apparently did n't want to hide your shame by turning on private listening , but we , your @entity40 stalkers , are kind of bummed out by your musical sad - making			2
also , you obviously want @entity204 - er to know just how tortured you really are and perhaps come running into your open arms ! well , why not make more of a statement with your sad song of choice and share it via this is my jam , a social site that allows you to choose one tune to put on display as the object of your musical obsession for seven whole days , complete with a description of why said tune struck your fancy			1
other users can follow you , so fret not : your pain will be on full display , complete with comments and likes			1
oh , and you 're encouraged to pick a new tune every week , so , yeah , you have about six more days left until we 're all over your tears .			0
