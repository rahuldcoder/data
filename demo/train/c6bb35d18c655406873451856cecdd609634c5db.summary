@entity0 -- an @entity3 man charged with murder will be retried on the most serious offenses after the @entity7 @entity6 concluded thursday a hung jury in his original criminal prosecution did not prevent the state from getting a second chance at a conviction			1
the 6 - 3 majority rejected the appeal of @entity15 , accused of killing his girlfriend 's infant son			1
" the jury in this case did not convict @entity15 of any offense , but it did not acquit him of any either , " said chief justice @entity18			1
" when the jury was unable to reach a verdict , the trial court properly declared a mistrial and discharged the jury			1
as a consequence , the @entity28 does not stand in the way of a second trial on the same offenses			0
" @entity15 was prosecuted for capital murder , but the death penalty was waived if he were to be convicted			1
but the trial judge said the @entity38 jury could also consider three less serious crimes			2
during deliberations , the judge asked for a progress report , and the panel 's forewoman in open court announced the jurors had rejected the capital and first - degree murder charges , but could not agree on manslaughter			1
they eventually deadlocked , and because of that , the 12 members did not even consider a separate , negligent homicide charge			2
the judge then declared a mistrial , but refused to give @entity15 a partial victory on the capital and first - degree murder charges			1
prosecutors then decided to retry the 29 - year - old man on all the charges			1
the second trial was postponed until the high court could decide whether the defendant 's constitutional rights were being violated			0
the @entity28 of the @entity64 prevents trying a person again for a crime after a verdict of not guilty			0
but state courts around the country are at odds on whether split verdicts on some counts allow retrial on all counts			0
@entity18 , writing for the majority , said trial courts could			0
" we have never required a trial court , before declaring a mistrial because of a hung jury , to consider any particular means of breaking the impasse -- let alone to consider giving the jury new options for a verdict , " he said			2
justice @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity90 supported the decision			2
@entity15 had argued the jury should have been allowed to " give effect " to the jury 's internal votes of not guilty on capital and first - degree murder			1
" at its core , the @entity28 reflects the wisdom of the founding generation ... that one acquittal or conviction should satisfy the law , " she wrote in a dissenting opinion			0
she added , " this case demonstrates that the threat to individual freedom from reprosecutions that favor states and unfairly rescue them from weak cases has not waned with time			0
only this court 's vigilance has			0
" justices @entity114 and @entity116 joined the dissent			0
the @entity119 defendant was prosecuted in the november 2007 death of 20 - month - old @entity121 the state said the boy 's brain injuries were comparable to someone being dropped off a building			0
@entity127 told police it was an accident , that he " reflexively elbowed " the child into a nearby chair			2
the case is @entity15 v. @entity3 ( 10 - 1320 ) .			1
