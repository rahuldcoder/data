paint peeling off the walls			0
a mangled wicker chair made settable with a board			0
an ancient stove with a giant hole			1
and there 's also the pile of underwear in the living room			0
what looks and feels like the most rundown frat house on campus is actually the @entity16 home of some of the most powerful men in @entity19			1
" welcome to the @entity23 , " joked @entity20 , who is the second - ranking @entity21 in the @entity22			1
" this is where i 've lived for 31 years , " boasted @entity24 , the @entity22 's third - ranking @entity21			1
it 's hard to believe half the @entity22 @entity27 leadership lives in these conditions , together			1
but they have for decades			2
when rep. @entity31 , @entity32 , the third roommate and landlord , came in the door , he immediately ribbed the @entity35 as deadbeats			1
" you guys get the rent from them ? " asked @entity31			1
the house is so legendary that it inspired the new television series " @entity43 " on @entity44			2
' how can this work ? ' none of the real " @entity43 " members has seen the show , so they said			0
but they were all quick to say the characters -- who are @entity52 -- are nothing like them			2
" how can this work ? " asked @entity20			1
" @entity35 trying to make out they would live in a place like this			0
" they have a point , which may be why the creators of " @entity43 " cleaned up the fictitious home			2
maybe it 's that life is stranger than fiction			0
or , more likely , no one would believe prominent politicians would live the way they do in the real @entity43			2
" wait a minute ! " exclaimed @entity31 , the owner , when we pointed that out			1
but he was feigning offense			0
thirty seconds with the three and it is clear they revel in the notoriety of their living conditions			0
still , it has been years since they all gathered for this kind of interview and tour of the @entity16 row house			2
the odd living arrangement began in the early ' 80s -- when @entity31 's family decided they no longer wanted to live in @entity32 , and moved back to the @entity32 district he represents			1
@entity31 was living in the house alone until one night when there was a snowstorm and former @entity27 rep. @entity89 of @entity90 stayed over so he could walk to the @entity16			1
they decided to make it permanent since it was convenient			0
they soon convinced @entity24 , a @entity23 member at the time , to move in			1
they had other roommates over the years that have since retired or been defeated , including former @entity99 and defense secretary @entity100 , when he was in @entity101			0
but what is most striking about the place , aside from the mess , is that it 's a time warp			1
they 've done virtually nothing to update since @entity31 's family left three decades ago			1
@entity108 and the @entity109 records -- real vinyl -- line the bookshelf			1
one of them was @entity108 's " @entity114 , " which came out in 1976			0
another was an old @entity109 album			0
" the same exact records are there now as the day i moved in , 1982 , 31 years ago , " @entity24 said			1
then there are the dust - covered books that were bestsellers in the early ' 80s			2
the furniture is a hodgepodge of what the lawmakers salvaged from various relatives and other parts of their lives			2
@entity20 took one of the couches from his son , who was about to throw it out			1
" he put it out in the trash -- it had to be 12 , 14 years ago -- and i said it 's better than anything we have			0
so we reclaimed it , " @entity20 recalled			1
he said the coffee table is 46 years old -- the first piece of furniture @entity20 and his wife bought when they were married			1
" we 're not afraid of the burglars , " @entity31 said , " because we 've been burgled twice and they took nothing			1
" the living room , virtually the only room on the first floor of the house , also serves as @entity24 's bedroom			1
but " bedroom " is a generous term			0
he sleeps on a mattress next to the kitchen			1
he half - made his bed for our visit , which @entity20 said was a lot more effort than @entity24 usually makes			1
" i spruced it up for your coming here , " joked @entity24			1
too much information there is no bathroom on the first floor , so @entity24 has to use one on the second floor , where @entity31 and @entity20 have actual bedrooms , with doors			1
" when you 're my age , at four in the morning to trudge up the stairs to the bathroom , it 's no picnic , " @entity24 shared			1
next to his mattress is a door to the outside , with broken and bent blinds			0
" i can see the weather without having to get out of bed , " @entity24 said			1
" it 's a special effect			0
" his ties are strewn over an old couch , which serves as his makeshift closet			0
and then , there 's the kitchen			0
the freezer does n't work			0
the refrigerator is a sight to behold , but exactly what you would imagine based on the rest of the house : beer cans and old food , including a baguette so hard that @entity24 grabbed it and demonstrated how you can use it as a weapon			1
the stovetop has a giant hole , which @entity31 said , perhaps in jest , was made by the rats they 've found in the house -- which they still have traps around to catch			1
" i thought the rats were in the @entity22			0
i did n't know they came to the @entity23 , " @entity31 said without missing a beat			2
since the only visible cookware is a kettle so rusty and old that @entity31 joked it was a gift from @entity218 , the three men resort to the easiest meal possible : cold cereal			2
the counter is covered with bulk boxes of @entity223 , mini-wheats and @entity225			0
and there is a giant plastic bag of sweetener , which looks like it has been swiped from various fundraisers along the way			0
but i like the mini-wheats , " @entity20 said			2
" when you come home late at night and you have to still stay up to work , my incentive ? some people like a nice , you know , jigger of scotch			0
it keeps me up and i read the newspapers , " @entity24 said			2
early risers what is a typical day in the house like ? @entity20 is usually the first one up and out at 5:30 a.m. when he goes to the gym			1
next is @entity31 , who usually takes a morning walk around the monuments			2
" they leave while i 'm sleeping			0
we do it by design			0
we hate each other , " @entity24 said , laughing			2
in all seriousness , they do n't do much hanging out together here			0
unlike the " @entity43 " characters , the real lawmakers are rarely home at the same time			1
" he comes in at 12 o'clock at night talking on his cell phone , " @entity31 said of @entity24			1
" half his staff must be in @entity263 for picking up the phone at midnight			0
" it is hard to believe such high - profile politicians live in these conditions			0
" when my wife comes , she will not stay here , " @entity24 confessed			2
what helps make it work is that they 're only in @entity19 about three nights a week			1
and , @entity31 said , they 're good friends			1
" we all have different schedules			0
we all have different interests			0
you can come back here			0
you can catch up with one another			0
you can catch up with the @entity23 and the @entity22			0
we know one another 's families , so you know what the kids are doing			0
you know what the grandkids are doing , " @entity31 said			2
" i might add location , location , location , " @entity20 interjected			2
the house is just blocks from the @entity16			0
" it is close to where we work			0
and it 's easy to get back and forth , and i think that has spoiled us , " @entity20 said			2
@entity20 sums up another reason he 's lived here for 21 years , and @entity24 for 31 , this way : " we love it			1

what *resembles* a frat house is actually home to prominent @entity27 lawmakers
rep. @entity31 and sens. @entity24 and @entity20 have lived there for decades
old records and books , a mattress off the kitchen , an ancient stove with a hole in it -- a time warp
