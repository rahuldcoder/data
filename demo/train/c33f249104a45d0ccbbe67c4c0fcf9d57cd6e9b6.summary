@entity0 -- a treasure worth an estimated half billion dollars in gold and silver coins , recovered from a @entity6 warship that sunk two centuries ago , arrived in @entity0 saturday , just weeks after @entity8 courts ruled that @entity6 had rights to the loot , not the @entity12 deep - sea salvage company which found it on the ocean floor			1
two @entity6 military cargo planes , which retrieved the nearly 594,000 coins in crates from a secretive warehouse in @entity12 , landed at the @entity20 military air base in @entity0 just before 2 p.m. ( 8 a.m. et )			1
the two planes arrived at a @entity8 military base in @entity12 earlier this week -- on the heels of a team of @entity6 government experts who did an inventory of the treasure -- and departed on friday for the overnight flight to @entity0			1
that was after the @entity12 company , @entity29 had exhausted its legal appeals all the way to the @entity8 @entity34 , which declined without comment @entity29 's motion for a hearing earlier this month			1
" @entity6 has now been victorious at every level in the @entity8 courts , from @entity43 to @entity44 to @entity45 , " said @entity38 , who defended @entity6 's claim to the treasure			1
" i am pleased and proud for all of us			0
" @entity29 made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court 's order that it turn over the treasure to @entity6			1
the dispute goes back to 2007 , when @entity29 announced it had found a 19th - century sunken ship off of @entity6			1
the company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the @entity8			1
@entity6 filed suit in a federal court in @entity43 , @entity12 , also claiming the treasure			2
@entity6 says its navy warship @entity64 was carrying the coins			2
the 34 - gun frigate left @entity66 in 1804 and crossed the @entity67 to within a day 's sail from @entity6 when @entity70 ships attacked the @entity6 fleet			0
in the ensuing @entity72 , south of @entity73 , the @entity64 was hit in its powder magazine and exploded , according to the @entity6 government 's filing to the @entity12 court			0
in 2009 , the federal court in @entity43 ruled in favor of @entity6 and the federal appeals court in @entity44 upheld the ruling last september			0
last january 31 , the appeals court denied an @entity29 motion , which @entity29 appealed to the @entity34			0
@entity6 's culture minister , @entity83 , told @entity1 in @entity0 earlier this month that the case was never really about the money			0
" we 're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition , but this is something that enriches our material , artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such , " @entity83 said in an interview			0
he said the coins would be exhibited at @entity6 museums , and perhaps elsewhere			2
@entity66 , too , has followed the fate of the coins , which came from @entity98 when @entity66 was a @entity6 colony			2
" formally , they have n't claimed anything , but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the @entity98 museums , " @entity83 said			0
the treasure includes fabled " pieces of eight , " some minted in 1803 in @entity108 , @entity66 , @entity6 officials have said			2
the treasure , which already has crossed the @entity67 twice , by ship in 1804 and then by plane in 2007 , has now arrived on the @entity6 mainland for the first time			1
a @entity6 @entity115 official at the @entity20 base said the treasure will be turned over to @entity6 's paramilitary @entity118 for safekeeping			0
the @entity120 is expected to hold a news conference and possibly show off a portion of the coins in the coming days .			0

a treasure estimated worth half a billion dollars arrived in @entity6
the coins had been the object of a legal *battle* in the @entity8
the company that found the treasure lost its claim in the courts
