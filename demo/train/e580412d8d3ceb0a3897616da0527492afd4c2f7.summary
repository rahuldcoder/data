-- forget the 4g marketing hype			0
which @entity3 carriers really offer the fastest mobile - data networks ? according to a new report from @entity7 ( a company which conducts its own field tests of wireless networks ) , @entity5 currently offers the nation 's fastest @entity10 -- by far			1
@entity7 recently compared 4g networks from the four major @entity3 carriers in 27 cities			1
across all cities , @entity5 performed at @entity16 in 66 % of tests			1
what qualifies as @entity10 speed ? according to @entity7 , that 's a download speed of at least three megabits per second -- fast enough to download a 30 - minute standard - definition tv episode in less than 10 minutes			1
" in cities where we could test @entity5 's @entity26 ( network ) , their average download speeds were roughly equivalent with the other carriers ' maximum download speeds			1
in several markets , @entity5 's average download speeds actually exceeded the maximum speeds of the other carriers , " the report said			2
what about the other carriers ? according to the report , " @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38 offered similar performances to one another overall and jockeyed back and forth behind @entity5 across the markets			1
@entity36 and @entity37 were especially close : @entity36 offered 4g speed in 40.7 % of our tests , while @entity37 recorded 4g speed in 39.5 % of our tests			1
" of course , carriers do not deploy 4g networks evenly across a given metro area			1
they tend to focus deployment in more densely populated areas , and along major highways and office or shopping districts			0
depending on the city and the carrier , they may also deploy more 4g resources in wealthier neighborhoods			0
so the report noted : " in those cities where @entity26 was not available , @entity5 performed markedly slower			1
where @entity26 is present , @entity5 is easily the fastest ; where @entity26 is not , @entity5 is among the slowest carriers for data delivery			0
" most mobile users do n't download huge files to their phones , so " upper @entity68 " download speeds ( 1.5 - 3 mbps , according to @entity7 ) will still seem pretty impressive to a typical mobile user			0
and even " lower 3g " speeds ( between 500 kilobytes / second and 1.5 mbps ) are adequate for most mobile activities			0
on this front , @entity36 's @entity72 + network is pretty dependable , said @entity7 : " @entity36 delivered 3g speeds more consistently than the other carriers : they recorded upper 3g speed in 28 % of our tests and lower 3g speed in 20 % of our tests			1
@entity36 fell below @entity68 speeds in only 11 % of our tests , the lowest percentage of any of the carriers			2
" @entity37 's performance was mostly similar to @entity36 's in terms of @entity10 , but " disparities emerge when comparing @entity37 's non- 4g tests to @entity36 's			1
when @entity37 did n't hit @entity10 , they ... were more prone to slipping to slower 3g speeds			2
" @entity38 may offer more consumer - friendly @entity10 data plans than @entity36 or @entity5 -- but there 's a performance tradeoff			1
@entity7 found " a significant disparity between cities where @entity38 had @entity99 available and those where @entity99 was either not present or access to it proved sporadic			2
for instance , @entity38 delivered a market - best average download speed of 4.6 mbps in @entity99 - enabled @entity104 , while recording a noticeably slow 0.5 mbps in @entity105			1
" if you like to post or live - stream audio or video from your phone to the @entity110 , you probably care about upload speeds -- which means you might want to avoid @entity38 , unless it offers a wimax network in your city			2
" @entity38 's average upload speeds were consistently slow			0
@entity38 was the only carrier to never record an average upload speed above 1.0 mbps in any of the markets we tested , " said the report			0
@entity38 also markets cell phone service through several discount carriers that focus on no - contract mobile plans , such as @entity123 and @entity124 -- and some of these brands are starting to market @entity10 phones and service			1
@entity128 , vice president of marketing for @entity7 , clarified that the company 's numbers for @entity38 would apply to other carriers that rely on @entity38 's networks			1
if you 're unsure , you can ask the discount carriers whether they use @entity38 's network in your city -- and whether it 's a @entity99 network or not			0
@entity137 ( which never rolled out much of a 3g network ) has been aggressively deploying its own @entity26 network			0
the current @entity10 comparison report does not include @entity137 , but @entity141 says @entity7 is starting to add @entity137 and other carriers to its field testing regimen			2
the company plans to start publishing city reports with data from these carriers by the end of this year			0
in addition to rating carriers ' 4g performance across all of the cities , the report rated cities according to how much choice local residents have in @entity10 carriers			2
when rating cities for @entity160 and quality , @entity7 took more than speed into account : by their reckoning , a " @entity168 " must also offer a choice of reliable 4g providers			2
in all , 19 of the 27 cities @entity7 examined had at least three ( and sometimes four ) carriers offering download speeds of at least 3 mbps in more than 40 % of their field tests			1
@entity173 and @entity174 , @entity175 , topped this list , achieving 4g speeds in over 61 % of tests			0
the remaining eight 4g cities had at least two carriers meeting this benchmark			0
@entity182 and @entity183 were at the bottom of this category , each reaching 4g speeds in about 42 % of field tests			0
if you 're trying to find the best cell phone network where you live , do n't just rely on carrier coverage maps or speed claims -- which are often based on theoretical maximum output from cell towers			0
@entity7 offers coverage maps based on data gathered via its own field testing team , plus crowdsource data gathered via its @entity200 and @entity201 apps			0
in the last year it has also published mobile performance reports for about three dozen major @entity3 metro areas			2
@entity204 , another source to check , offers similar crowdsourced data gathered via its @entity201 app. the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity210 .			0

@entity5 performed at @entity16 in 66 % of tests -- better than @entity36 , @entity38 , @entity37
@entity10 speed means a download speed of at least three megabits per second
