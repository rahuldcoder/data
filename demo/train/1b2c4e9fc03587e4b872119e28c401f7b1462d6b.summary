-- with the debut of @entity4 's new show @entity3 on @entity5 this sunday , i 've been thinking about the best film depictions of journalism in @entity9 history			1
any ' best - of ' list is inherently subjective , but you definitely do n't need to be a journalist to appreciate the sense of purpose these classic films provide			1
so without further ado and just for fun on a summer weekend , below are my nominations for the top five journalism films of all time			1
" network " : @entity23 's satire is still razor sharp after almost 40 years , offering a prophetic look at what would happen when news desks started answering to entertainment divisions			1
the film also managed to anticipate the rise of reality tv , with one surreal side plot in which a self - styled " liberation army " gets its own television show and immediately goes from talking about the proletariat to negotiating net versus gross contracts			2
but in the end it is a morality play , featuring @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 as @entity43 , a network anchor over the edge of a nervous breakdown who shouts the immortal line " i 'm mad as hell and i 'm not gon na take it anymore ! " during the meteoric rise and fall of @entity52 , i was half convinced that he 'd announce he was punking us by trying to make @entity43 come alive			1
entertainment : what @entity4 learned from @entity0 for " newsroom " " @entity58 " : the genius of this dramatic depiction of @entity61 is that the movie keeps you in suspense even when everybody knows how the story is going to end			1
@entity67 and @entity68 are a perfect pairing as @entity70 and @entity71 , with @entity72 playing @entity73 , all capturing the chase of a great story as it unfolds			2
the film was made just a few years after @entity79 's resignation , but somehow it does not sacrifice the film 's sense of perspective on a time when journalists uncovered a corrosive conspiracy at the highest level of the government and toppled a president who only 20 months before had won a 49 - state landslide			2
" @entity90 " : this @entity92 - directed 2005 film is a small masterpiece , filmed in black and white			1
@entity94 perfectly captures the integrity of @entity96 facing down @entity97 at a time when the witch hunt for the @entity101 enemy within was ending careers and creating an atmosphere of fear			0
the film is funny and smart , with tight construction and an ensemble cast that includes @entity108 and a chubbed - up @entity92 as @entity96 's producer @entity109			0
the opening scene speech , taken from @entity96 's own words , should be regular required viewing for anyone in the news industry			0
key line : " to be persuasive we must be believable ; to be believable we must be credible ; to be credible we must be truthful			0
" " @entity116 " : armed with a perfect cast of @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 , " @entity116 " is a brilliant comedy that captures the outsized influence of the anchorman -- played by @entity124 -- back in the days of the @entity125			1
adding depth are cutaway scenes depicting the characters as neurotic children			0
it is ultimately a story about ambition and unrequited love , offering a useful , if not particularly uplifting , meditation on the unsteady boundary between infatuation , love and trust			0
" his girl friday " : @entity141 directed this 1930s slapstick comedy , which is based on the @entity144 - penned screenplay for @entity145			1
@entity146 plays editor @entity147 trying to woo his ex-wife and fellow journalist @entity149 ( @entity150 ) back to the world of the newsroom , with its roll - top desks , three - martini lunches , rotary phones and manual typewriters clacking away			0
in a nice bit of symmetry , the film debuted the overlapping dialogue technique that @entity4 later perfected			0
@entity162 mentions : falling outside this list include " @entity164 , " " @entity165 , " @entity167 's epic , hilarious performance as @entity169 in " anchorman , " and the fifth season of " the wire			2
" buy them , rent them , download them - but most of all , enjoy them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			0
