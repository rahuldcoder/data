-- one of us is @entity2 and the other @entity3			1
but we have many important things in common			0
both of us are in the military and were deployed to @entity7 in support of @entity9			1
we 're both proud to serve and fight for our countries -- and both of us have served successfully			1
but when our military colleagues found out that we are transgender , our careers took different paths			1
here are our stories : @entity2 @entity16 flight lt. @entity17 : as a flight lieutenant , i serve as a navigator flying @entity21 with the @entity16			1
the role of my squadron is to support the @entity24 : from inserting assault troops , to resupply of austere bases , to escorting road convoys to casualty evacuation , and many other tasks			0
i am proud of the role my country plays in trying to stem the flow of global terrorism			0
i am proud of the military and the people who risk their lives -- in @entity2 and elsewhere around the world -- to do this and i am proud of my own military service			1
i am also a transgender woman ; i have known this all my conscious life , but my military did n't know until i told them after 18 years of service to the @entity16			1
because of my country 's inclusive military policy , i was allowed to remain in the @entity16 and became the first transgender officer to serve openly in the @entity2 military , and i have done so proudly for 16 years			1
it was n't easy at first , because people fear what they do n't know			0
i set out to prove them wrong by ensuring there was no difference in my capabilities or who i was in my job			0
when my aircraft first deployed to @entity58 in 2005 , and then again to @entity7 in 2009 , i made sure i was there			1
as the squadron 's lead tactician and defensive aids expert , i had to lead from the front to ensure the safety of our @entity2 soldiers and our allies			2
to fly into perilous locations requires that you know precise procedures like the back of your hand , and on several occasions i was at the right place at the right time to identify issues and trouble shoot problems with the aircraft 's equipment , earning the respect and admiration of my peers and superiors			0
my service and performance were rewarded with several commendations for " excellent service " -- first in 2007 with a two - star award , followed by commendation from the commander - in - chief of @entity91 in the 2012 @entity92			2
all of my endeavors on operations were focused on ensuring our aircraft had the best possible protection , through equipment and tactics			0
had i not been able to continue my military service because i was transgender , i would n't have been in the right place at the right time to make that vital difference for my colleagues and my nation			2
former @entity105 petty officer @entity104 : in august of 2013 , i left my parent command in @entity107 and arrived on the @entity108 to begin training to deploy to @entity7 in support of @entity9			1
for three months of training , i was " one of the guys , " and no one questioned my gender or referred to me as a woman			0
for those three months , i did n't feel like i had to walk on eggshells , and i did n't worry about being outed as transgender			2
after a pit stop in @entity118 in november , where my senior leaders laughed at their mistake in trying to put me in a female barracks room , i landed in @entity7 , and was immediately put to work			2
as a junior sailor , i found myself in a place i had never imagined : working as the lead liaison between foreign militaries , such as the @entity126 and the @entity127 ; as well as domestic governmental agencies , including the @entity129 , @entity130 , and @entity131			2
i was proud to serve my country in a mission - critical role			2
but three weeks later , everything changed : my senior chief pulled me aside and escorted me into the sergeant major 's office			0
in front of him sat my original enlistment paperwork , which listed me as female			0
within hours , i was put on a @entity142 back to the @entity3 with my departure , there was no one trained to fill my position in @entity7			1
someone must have thought i was doing a good job , because three days after the @entity105 sent me back to @entity107 , i was promoted and given a @entity149 of commendation from the admiral of 10th @entity152			0
but at the same time it was promoting me , the @entity105 was preparing my discharge papers			0
in march of 2014 , i was honorably discharged for being transgender			2
@entity17 and @entity104 : after serving in @entity9 , we and others attended the first - ever gathering of currently serving transgender personnel from around the world to share our stories			1
some of the 18 nations that allow transgender service members to serve openly were represented at this recent conference in @entity164 , sponsored by the @entity165 and @entity166			1
as members of the military community , it is not our place to tell civilian leaders what to do			0
we do want to be sure , however , that people understand the main message emerging from our personal stories , and from the experiences of service members from other forces who participated in the conference : transgender personnel serve just as effectively as everyone else , even in austere environments like @entity7			1
just like nontransgender personnel , we care about doing our jobs well , so that our militaries can fulfill their missions			0
if and when our two countries come to follow the same policy , we are sure that the adjustment will be successful .			0
