-- he had grand plans on how to rebuild his broken land , but @entity5 president @entity4 ca n't even get over the first hurdle : forming a government			1
@entity5 's parliament rejected tuesday the new president 's pick for prime minister , @entity11 , sending @entity4 back to the drawing board			1
meanwhile , it has been more than six months since @entity5 first went to the polls to vote for new leadership after last year 's devastating earthquake			1
@entity4 , a former pop star , nominated @entity11 , an entrepreneur who also helped lead a @entity18 charity in @entity5 , on may 20			1
many @entity5 had expressed hope the pair would be a jolt of fresh energy			2
after days of hearings and required documentation , 42 members of the @entity26 voted against @entity11 's nomination , while 19 deputies voted for him and three abstained , the @entity24 news agency reported			1
those who opposed @entity32 questioned his allegiances for his appointment as honorary consul for @entity36 and alleged that the millionaire businessman -- his family owns a car business in @entity40 -- had failed to pay proper taxes			0
the latter charge made longtime observers of @entity5 laugh aloud			1
who in @entity5 has ever been honest about that , asked @entity46 , a @entity5 - born political strategist and human rights expert			2
the real problem , he said , seems to be more of a political stalemate between @entity4 , who appealed to the masses for his political novice , and veteran politicians who are perhaps resentful of that			1
" the legislature is flexing its muscle in anticipation of the battles to come with @entity4 , " @entity46 said			2
and that , said @entity46 , does not bode well for an impoverished nation struggling to recover from the enormous setback it suffered last year			0
@entity5 was the most worsened nation on this year 's index of failed states released this week by the @entity64 in @entity65			1
" the process of rebuilding @entity5 is essentially stalled , " @entity46 said			2
that process has already been painfully slow for the @entity5 people			2
tens of thousands of @entity5 continue to live in makeshift camps ; rubble still soars high on some streets -- schools , hospitals , roads , houses have yet to be rebuilt			0
frustration with a lack of progress contributed to defeat for former president @entity82 's party			0
at first , @entity82 's protege , @entity83 , was named the no. 2 vote getter in the november election			0
but after charges of widespread fraud and weeks of review , @entity4 won that spot and a right to face former first lady @entity91 in a march runoff			1
by then , @entity5 were anxious to get a new government installed and get on with the task of piecing their nation back together			0
@entity97 , editor and publisher of the @entity100 - based newspaper @entity99 , said @entity82 stocked parliament with his own people			0
and they are likely to challenge @entity4 on every move at the expense of @entity5 , he said			1
" how do you govern in that situation ? " @entity97 asked			0
" there 's so many compromises you can make			0
i 'm not sure this parliament is going to be cooperative at all			0
" the @entity113 mission in @entity5 issued a statement wednesday urging @entity5 to pick a new prime minister quickly			1
every day that passes , it said , is to the detriment of the people			0
" there is no doubt that all @entity5 are united in their desire to see future major projects -- including those related to improving their living conditions -- moving as quickly as possible , " the statement said .			0

new president @entity4 nominates @entity11 as prime minister
but @entity5 's parliament rejects @entity11 's nomination
observers say parliament 's move does not bode well for @entity5
some say @entity4 will face many more challenges from politicians
