-- on august 13 , 1963 , in a last ditch effort to derail the pending march on @entity3 , @entity1 took the @entity5 floor and hurled a series of vicious , personal attacks against the man organizing the largest protest in @entity11 history			1
@entity1 called him a communist and a draft dodger			0
he brought up a previous arrest and accused him of being immoral and a pervert			0
the man @entity1 was attacking was not dr. @entity18 in fact @entity1 used @entity18 's own words -- secretly recorded by @entity21 -- in his attacks against the march 's deputy director			1
" i hope @entity28 do n't take a drink before the march , " @entity25 , @entity18 's lawyer and close friend , said in the recording			1
" yes , " @entity18 replied			2
" and grab one little brother			0
' cause he will grab one when he has a drink			0
" " @entity28 " would be @entity33 , the most important leader of the civil rights movement you probably have never heard of			1
opinion : @entity37 , stand up for civil rights @entity33 was imprisoned for challenging racial segregation in the @entity40 before the phrase " @entity42 " was ever said			1
he taught a 25 - year - old @entity18 the true meaning of nonviolent civil disobedience while the great dreamer was still being flanked by armed bodyguards			1
and before addressing the crowd of 250,000 that gathered at the @entity50 nearly five decades ago , famed actor and activist @entity47 introduced him " as the man who organized this whole thing			0
" no , the reason why you probably have not heard of @entity33 has nothing to do with the significance of his contributions to the march on @entity3 or the civil rights movement in general			1
his absence is epitomized by the sentiment woven between the lines of that joke between @entity25 and @entity33 's protege			1
you see , the organizer of the great march , the man who held a fundraiser at @entity69 to help fund the bus boycott in @entity71 , the intellectual behind the founding of the @entity74 was also unabashedly gay			2
and it was the discomfort some had with his sexuality that led to his disappearance in our history books			0
" we must look back with sadness at the barriers of bigotry built around his sexuality , " wrote @entity84 chairman emeritus @entity83 in " i must resist , " a collection of @entity33 letters			1
" we are the poorer for it			0
" as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of arguably the single most important event of the 20th century -- as well as the speech that defined it -- there is a natural inclination to evaluate how close we are to achieving dr. @entity18 's famed dream			1
why some movements work and others wilt with president @entity104 in office , it is silly to suggest no progress has been made			0
but considering that the wealth gap between black and white families has nearly tripled over the past 25 years or that a recent @entity111 / @entity110 poll found that 40 % of white @entity11 do n't have a friend outside of their race , who can view the election of one man as @entity18 's dream being fulfilled ? yes , the residue of the @entity120 era still poisons the air like mold spores after a flood , manifesting in unjust laws such as @entity125 and @entity126 and clusters of failing schools in poor black neighborhoods			1
but after recently reading the full text of dr. @entity139 " speech , it occurred to me that perhaps the reason why we 're still divided as a nation is because we have n't figured out what is keeping us apart			2
despite being a leading voice for racial equality since the 1940s , @entity33 's marginalization is a direct reflection of oppression of a different sort			1
@entity1 used it as a weapon to attack the march on @entity3			1
@entity149 , a black congressman from @entity150 , used it to gain power			0
other black leaders , like @entity154 , used it to question his place in the movement			0
march on @entity3 : fast facts you see as big and as looming and as destructive as racism has been and continues to be in society , we must remember it is only a branch			1
the root of the problem , the reason why we continue to struggle with equality , is our pathological intolerance , an intolerance no collective group of people has proven to be immune to			0
" i say to you today , my friends , even though we face the difficulties of today , and tomorrow , i still have a dream			2
it is a dream deeply rooted in the @entity11 dream			2
i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up , live out the true meaning of its creed : ' we hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal			2
' " dr. @entity18 's dream has not been fulfilled because we began betraying the integrity of his dream the moment we started scrubbing @entity33 's life out of @entity192 lessons and civil rights movies			1
we betray that dream each time a black person claims offense to the notion that gay rights are civil rights , as if the black community is the only community capable of being oppressed			1
we betray @entity18 's dream each time a white elected official is allowed to say things about the gay community in ways that would never be tolerated if directed at the black community			1
i do n't say these things because i view the history and plight of these two minority groups as being exactly the same -- they are not			0
i say these things because racism and homophobia -- like anti-semitism , sexism and xenophobia -- all have the same mother			0
and as long as concessions are made for one , we will never be free from the clutches of the others			0
the @entity219 is the nation 's highest civilian award			0
it was established by president @entity223 50 years ago			0
considering the anniversary of the march , it is fitting that @entity33 is among the 16 being honored with it in november			1
but like @entity18 , he was more than august 28 , 1963			2
and so while the medal is special , the best way to honor him is to talk about him , all of him , both now and in the many years to come			0
@entity33 spent his life fighting for peace and equality and he did so unashamed of who he was			2
it 's about time history , and the people he helped most , stop being ashamed of him			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity33 was a civil rights leader and @entity18 's mentor
@entity241 says @entity33 's role in march on @entity3 was largely erased
he says @entity33 was banished from a prominent role because he was gay
@entity241 : if we tolerate bigotry of any form , we ca n't achieve @entity18 's dream
