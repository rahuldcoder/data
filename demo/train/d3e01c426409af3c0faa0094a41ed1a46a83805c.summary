-- @entity2 's phone number is for sale , but not for a song			1
" @entity2 " originally appeared on @entity6 's " @entity7 " album			1
bids for a @entity10 version of the number , stuck in the minds of millions since @entity6 's " @entity2 " hit the @entity13 in 1982 , had reached $ 5,100 on @entity14 as of monday morning			1
the song is about a guy who finds @entity2 's name and number scribbled on a bathroom wall			1
" this is really , in my opinion , one of the last cultural remnants of the ' 80s pop culture era ... other than the mullet , " said @entity20 , a 28 - year - old @entity21 who is selling the number he got for free five years ago			1
while @entity20 is overlooking the fact that " @entity2 " is an active phone number in dozens of other area codes , it does get called a lot by curious people			1
@entity20 said he has gotten about 40 calls a day since he got the area code 201 version for his @entity38 , @entity10 , @entity21 business			1
" the minute we plugged the phone jack into the wall , it began ringing , " @entity20 said			2
mostly , @entity20 said , the callers are " a lot of ' 80s fanatics " and he lets the calls ring through to his voice mail			0
when he did answer a call three years ago , @entity20 found his own @entity2 on the line			0
" she had been using my number to give out to guys that she did n't like at bars , " he said			2
" it was a bum phone number			1
" the young lady from @entity58 , @entity10 , told @entity20 she was just curious about who might be getting the calls			0
@entity20 ended up asking her out			0
" i figured if she was having to give out a bum number that often then she was probably pretty cute , " he said			2
" we ended up meeting for drinks			0
we dated for awhile and it was actually a great friendship			0
" @entity20 recently moved from @entity38 and decided to try to make money off the infamous digits with an @entity14 auction			1
@entity20 's @entity21 business goes with the number , a necessary provision to get around phone company rules against selling telephone numbers , he said			1
phone companies technically own the numbers , not the customers			2
@entity20 said @entity78 , the company that assigned the number , gave him permission to transfer it as part of the sale of his business			2
@entity14 halted a 2004 auction by the purported holder of the 212 area code version of the number , the @entity84 reported			1
a @entity90 - area resident who holds the toll - free versions -- both 800 and 888 -- said he values his numbers in the millions			0
@entity93 said his best offer so far , rejected several years ago , was for $ 1 million from a national weight - loss company			0
he acquired the numbers in the early 1990s for a pizza delivery campaign and has licensed them for other advertisers in the years since			0
@entity20 said when his auction ends next monday , february 9 , he hopes to make at least $ 40,000			0
he said he would use the money to take a @entity102 vacation -- away from his ringing phone			0
