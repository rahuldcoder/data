@entity0 says he is " most likely " running for re-election in 2016 , but is aware that he will be a top target for conservative groups gunning for establishment @entity3 in primaries			1
in an interview with @entity10 , the @entity8 senator stepped closer to pulling the trigger on a campaign for a sixth term and seems to be spoiling for the fight			1
but he also said he 's not sure @entity3 can hang on to the @entity15 in two years after grabbing it back from @entity17 in the midterm elections			0
" i am approaching it , that decision , and it 's most likely that i will announce that i am a running again , " said @entity0 , who will be 80 at the time of the 2016 election			1
@entity0 had previously said he was considering and " leaning towards " a campaign but would announce his intentions in early 2015			1
the veteran senator is about to get his firmest grip on power in @entity28 since his defeat to president @entity30 in the 2008 election			0
he will serve as chairman of the influential @entity33 when @entity3 take the majority in january			0
but @entity0 said he would run the committee on the assumption that he will be chairman for only two years , because the @entity3 majority 's fate will also be decided in 2016			1
" it is certainly not clear whether we keep the @entity15 or not , " he said			0
" that will depend on how we can show the @entity43 people with a @entity3 majority that we can govern or not			0
" @entity0 knows that tea party and other activists are already lining him up and could seek to exploit positions on immigration and torture that have put him at odds with the conservative base			2
" i will be at the top of the list , there is no doubt about that , " said @entity0			2
" i expect a vigorous campaign			2
for me to expect anything else would be foolish			2
and i 'm not foolish			0
" in his last election , in 2010 , @entity0 fought off a vocal primary challenge from conservative former @entity61 @entity3 and radio host @entity62			1
since then , a number of @entity65 - backed candidates have made a practice of challenging longtime lawmakers and candidates favored by the party establishment in primaries .			0

says would be " foolish " not to expect tough primary challenge
