-- the legendary @entity1 may have won the most titles , a 21 - year - old @entity3 may have been the youngest champion and @entity4 may have made the most appearances , but a little - known @entity7 golfer will be added to the illustrious list of masters record - holders on thursday			1
for when @entity11 steps onto the first tee , the @entity7 teenager will become the youngest competitor -- at the age of 14 years and five months -- in the 80 years of the prestigious @entity16 event , beating the previous record held by then 16 - year - old @entity18			1
the boy who has been taking time out of school in his home city @entity22 earned his place at golf 's top table when , as the youngest player in the field , he beat a host of senior players to win last year 's @entity30 in @entity31			1
he is just the latest of a small but expanding list of teenage -- and , remarkably , even pre-teen -- golfers to be impacting upon the highest echelons of golf , despite being drawn from a playing pool estimated to be no more than 600 teenage boys and girls			0
@entity11 was just 13 when he became the youngest player to ever contest a @entity41 event in 2012 , the same year that @entity42 , then 14 , became the youngest player in the history of the @entity45 -- while that year 's @entity46 found the youngest @entity7 female golfer to ever contest a major , @entity48 , then 16			1
@entity49 just last month , all were slightly upstaged by @entity51 , who became the youngest golfer to qualify for a @entity41 event -- at the age of just 12			1
yes , that 's right			0
" i do n't think there 's another country in the world that is putting as much into golf as @entity7 -- in terms of the resources , energy and money , " says @entity56 , the @entity57 - born head coach of @entity7 's women 's @entity59 team			1
" look at most other countries , they support players as amateurs but the support stops once they get to pro -- then , they 're on their own and have to do it themselves			0
" but our girls -- all they need to do is train			0
we do the logistics , which tournaments will suit them and where they should train			0
we also have a physio , fitness instructor , technical coaches and people arranging logistics , visa , flights and hotels			0
" and the state is paying for it all			0
it is like a monster sponsorship program			0
" of course , it was n't always thus			0
opinion : for @entity3 , winning does take care of everything during @entity7 's @entity49 of 1966 - 1976 , golf was considered to be too bourgeois a pastime and any existing courses were dug up , with the land returned to farmers			1
eight years after chairman @entity106 's death , though , the first modern - day golf course was built -- in 1984 -- even if there was still a reluctance to invest fully in the sport in the nominally communist nation			1
eye - wateringly expensive for with its 1.35 billion inhabitants representing nearly 20 % of the world population -- yet the country 's landmass amounting to just 6 % of the planet 's total land area -- land in @entity7 is decidedly scarce			1
so it makes no sense for politicians to allocate great swathes to golf courses , especially given ecological concerns -- primarily over water use -- that accompany their operational capacity and the association with the wealthy elite			0
while the number of courses has quietly tripled in the last decade to over 600 , golf is still very much a minority sport and even though significant growth is expected with the expansion of a middle class predicted to have doubled its 2010 level of 52 million by 2015 , the sport is still eye - wateringly expensive			2
so much so that a 2008 survey by professional services company @entity139 established the average initiation cost of joining a @entity7 golf club to be $ 53,000 , with a regular round costing around $ 150 -- way beyond the reach of all but a fraction of the population			1
but help is at hand for some following a decision taken in 2009 in , of all places , the @entity152 capital @entity153			0
that was where the executive board of the @entity156 voted to return golf to the @entity159 in 2016 after a 112 - year absence			1
overnight , the @entity7 government -- which boasts a long history of investing in @entity59 sports -- finally had a reason to back golf			1
although figures are hard to come by , the intensity of their training programs indicates just how seriously the @entity7 are taking a potential fairway to medals			2
at his academy in @entity173 , @entity56 has a team of 15 @entity59 hopefuls , eight of whom attend full - time training , which is funded by a state who get value for money -- with the girls training six days a week if they are not contesting a tournament			2
" on a normal day , we get up at 0630 and do a fitness session for an hour , " he says			0
" after breakfast , we train until midday , when we rest until 1400			0
" then another two hours of training and then an hour of fitness training -- we are heavy on fitness training -- so it 's three hours of fitness and five hours of golf			2
" @entity7 ambition improving the players ' ranking is the major aim of the program , for the top 15 in the world gain automatic berths to @entity200 in 2016 , following which another 45 competitors will be chosen -- with a maximum of two available players from each country that does not already have two or more players among the top 15			2
a further indication of the @entity7 ambition is that @entity210 legend @entity209 has been formally brought on board to advise and identify the country 's best golf talent , which is largely drawn from privileged backgrounds -- for obvious reasons -- but he wo n't struggle with one name for the ladies category			1
last year , @entity218 -- now 23 -- became the first @entity7 golfer to win a major when she claimed the @entity221 by two strokes , five years after she had earned her place on the @entity224 as a teenage amateur			2
ranked no. 8 in the world , she does not train with the team in @entity173 but looks a certainty for @entity229 -- especially since the next best @entity7 female golfers are ranked 160th and 285th respectively , whose improvements represent the major challenge for @entity56 , @entity209 and co. those working on the country 's male golfers have an even harder task , for there are only three @entity7 in the top 500 , with @entity239 -- the 34 - year - old whose best finish , by some distance , was eighth place in the 2010 @entity245 pga -- leading the way in 169th place			1
but it wo n't be long before the fruits of @entity7 's investment -- now reaching the grassroots for the first time -- will be clear for world golf fans to see , says a man who knows just a thing or two about the sport			1
" in @entity7 , they are incredibly passionate and you see how the game is growing , " says @entity257 , who coached @entity3 for six years and who now runs several golf schools			2
" i know from my academy that @entity265 golfers are incredibly great students -- they 're very , very focused and without a doubt , we 're going to see more and more great golfers coming from @entity265			0
" it wo n't be long before @entity7 is a big part of that			0
" perhaps just as long as it takes for @entity11 , @entity42 , @entity51 and the rest to exit their teenage years .			0

@entity11 will become the youngest player in @entity278 history on thursday
previous record held by then 16 - year - old @entity281 @entity18
@entity7 is investing heavily in golf ahead of @entity284 , says women 's team coach
during @entity7 's @entity49 , golf had been considered too bourgeois a pastime
