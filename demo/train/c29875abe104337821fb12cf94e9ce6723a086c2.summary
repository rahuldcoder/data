-- i would n't normally pay much attention to a sports star , even a fighting @entity5 hero			0
but it 's more than just a story about a sports star , is n't it ? the story of @entity11 and his putative online dead girlfriend ( may she , or this tale , rest in peace ) has a kind of oily vodka shimmer to it that transcends hypothetical naked ambition for the @entity20 and girlfriends with leukemia			1
i do n't know whether any of the story is true ; if some shred holds up , my condolences to all involved			2
but what i note about it is the flash of winking mirrors , the reflections that stand in for authenticated reality			1
yes , here i 'm going to say " @entity32 , on the wall , " but the mirror really is n't on the wall , but on the desktop or the portable device			0
those fine frangible screens , when dropped , can maintain their structure , though stricken with a jag like lightning			2
the screens are meant to be our windows to the world , but all too often they are only mirrors , reflecting back what we want to see			1
not the great and the good , not even the best and the brightest , but merely the brightest			2
somewhere in these flashing mirrors , we mistake the flash - lit celebrity , the lightning - strike story , for confirmed reality			1
we the readers of online news , and we the readers of e-mails , @entity57 and favorite blogs do it , too			0
we 've grown used to living without reality coordinates that can be tested not with further keystrokes but with a good swift kick to the tires			1
we would n't buy a car without test - driving it , and we ought not to rely on the flash of mirrors for our take on reality			1
there is too little focal depth in staring at a mirror			0
opinion : does @entity11 story make you laugh or cry ? that 's what drove @entity79 's old @entity78 mad			1
she did n't get out enough			0
she ought to have stopped texting herself and gone to a football game			0
she ought to have remembered that real news , even real gossip , begins in what is observed firsthand , not secondhand			0
she would have said , " where is this wonderful sick girlfriend ? " if @entity11 is not an active agent in some cold - blooded scam , she might have met him in his locker room to tell him what she thought of his lady love , or of her absence in the woods			1
( not sent a text message			0
) as a novelist , i 'm a professional liar			0
it 's my job to try to make the improbable seem plausible			1
my chiefest tool is making readers see themselves in the mirror of the tale			0
if i can pull that off , they 're hooked			0
can you picture @entity11 getting ready for the showers and being accosted by an old hag with a basket of apples ? if you can , even for a moment , i 've worked a certain spell , and i 've hooked you with my flashing mirror , but i have n't told the truth			1
maybe you can only see @entity11 trying to wipe the steamy mirror over the locker room sink clear of fog so he can say , " who 's the best player of us all ? " we should all try wiping away the fog more often			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity120 .			2

@entity120 : in the @entity11 " hoax " story there is the flash of mirrors , not reality
he says screens are meant to be windows to world , they often reflect what we want to see
he says we 've grown used to *believing* , not testing stories *buzzing* on our *smartphones*
@entity120 : good stories make improbable seem plausible . we should question them more
