@entity0 , @entity1 -- protesters angry over the government 's handling of a cholera outbreak clashed monday with peacekeepers in two towns in northern @entity1 , where the outbreak began last month			1
in @entity13 , schools and banks were closed , residents set fire to tires at entrances to the town and gunfire ricocheted through the streets , residents and officials told @entity2			1
@entity22 , a spokesman for @entity23 , the @entity25 ' stabilization mission in @entity1 , said anti-riot police were coping with the demonstrations , which he said began in the morning in at least two locations and had not caused any fatalities among peacekeepers or the population			1
" apparently , some people were injured by bottles or stones , " he said			2
" we are facing the consequences of a cholera epidemic and in two weeks the elections , so the population is scared , " he said			1
" it 's a volatile situation			1
" he pointed to the fact that demonstrations began in separate areas as evidence that the outbreak was not spontaneous			2
" right now , security forces ... seem to have control already of the situation , " he said			1
in addition , a police station was torched , the @entity25 peacekeeping force said			1
an employee at the office of @entity54 told @entity2 that the four daily flights typically scheduled between @entity0 and @entity13 had been canceled due to " political tension			1
" she declined to be named			2
" it 's not safe to walk in the streets , " @entity57 , a resident of @entity13 , told @entity2 by telephone			1
" all the schools and banks are closed			2
people are fighting the soldiers of @entity23			2
" the demonstrations began after rumors spread that a @entity69 contingent of peacekeepers may have spread the disease , he said			1
" so they attack them , " he said			2
" the people were shooting			2
" but @entity75 , a @entity25 spokeswoman , denied that its peacekeepers were responsible for the outbreak			1
@entity79 , a journalist with @entity80 , said he was aware of six injuries , one of them a child who was fatally shot			2
" many people from the slum area , they are burning tires , throwing rocks and bottles , " he said			2
" and they are very mad against @entity23			2
and there are rumors that @entity23 is responsible for the cholera			2
and the cholera killed many people in @entity13			1
now taxi drivers are afraid to bring people to the hospital			2
it is very difficult to find a taxi driver when someone is sick			0
" he said trash trucks were picking up the dead			0
in the town of @entity105 , northeast of the capital , about 400 demonstrators protested the peacekeepers , six of whom were injured , @entity22 said			1
radio rci reporter @entity110 said protesters threw rocks at @entity23 peacekeepers who , in turn , threw them back and also opened fire , wounding a protester			1
@entity1 police were patrolling the town looking for the rock throwers among the protesters , some of whom had set tires afire , he said			1
the cholera outbreak , which was first confirmed last month in northwest @entity1 , had spread across much of the country by monday , killing close to 1,000 people and entering the makeshift camps teeming with people who were made homeless in january 's massive earthquake , officials said			1
in all , 917 people were dead and 14,642 hospitalized as of friday , the @entity130 said on its website			0
in the capital alone , 27 were dead and more than 600 hospitalized , officials said			0
" it 's a really worrying situation for us at the moment , " said @entity135 , head of mission for @entity137 in @entity1 , over the weekend			1
" all of the hospitals in @entity0 are overflowing with patients and we 're seeing seven times the total amount of cases we had three days ago			0
" in the slum of @entity148 in the northern part of the capital , hundreds of people had sought treatment for the illness , he said			0
" patients are coming from everywhere , throughout the city , slums and wealthier areas			0
" if the numbers continue to increase at the current rate , he said , " then we 're going to have to adopt some drastic measures to be able to treat people			0
we 're going to have to use public spaces and even streets			1
i can easily see this situation deteriorating to the point where patients are lying in the street , waiting for treatment			1
at the moment , we just do n't have that many options			0
" @entity135 noted that the situation in @entity0 has been dire since the january 12 earthquake hammered what was already the poorest country in the @entity176 , killing more than 200,000 people and shattering its already weak infrastructure			1
" since the earthquake , every available space that was n't damaged has been filled by camps where people are living in extremely precarious conditions , " he said			0
" just to find an empty area in this city is a major logistical challenge , so for us to find room to treat people is very complicated			0
" the group , known in @entity190 as @entity137 , has more than 100 international staff and more than 400 @entity1 staff working in cholera treatment centers throughout the country , with more on the way , " but it 's just not enough , " he said			1
" we are close to being overwhelmed			0
" a scientist with the @entity198 - based @entity197 said he had been in several hospitals " that i would not characterize as overflowing ... but some places are busier than others			1
" still , @entity1 is particularly vulnerable to such an outbreak , said dr. @entity203 , a medical epidemiologist with the @entity197 's waterborne - disease prevention branch and one of 34 @entity197 personnel in the country			1
" it 's a country that has not seen epidemic cholera for decades , " he told @entity2 in a telephone interview			1
" so it 's an immunologically naive population , meaning that literally everyone is susceptible to infection			1
it 's a resource - poor country where hygiene and sanitary conditions are not what they could be , so this is a combination that can result in what we 're seeing now -- an outbreak with many cases			1
" the @entity197 workers were providing technical assistance , data and training to @entity1 health care workers , he said			0
there is some reason for optimism , said dr. @entity234 of @entity235 , in @entity0			0
" cholera is easy to treat ; it 's easy to prevent , " he said			1
" there is a great possibility to contain the number of cases			0
" the government was undertaking one such effort -- a public awareness campaign that uses cartoons to underscore in a graphic way that residents should wash their hands after using the bathroom to prevent cholera 's spread			1
such education could prove key , because this is the first such outbreak in living memory in @entity1 , so public knowledge about the disease and how to avoid it is scant			0
" this means there are a lot of misconceptions and rumors flying around , which has caused panic in the population , " @entity135 said			1
" some people are staying away from the cholera treatment centers or are afraid to have them in their neighborhoods because they think they help spread the disease			0
we 've been trying to explain that the opposite is true : the closer a center is to a population , the better			1
" though the disease can kill , it can also be treated successfully -- usually within two days , he noted			0
anyone entering or leaving a cholera treatment center is sprayed with chlorine to prevent the further spread of the bacteria			0
but completion of treatment does not necessarily mean the end of concern			0
many of those treated wind up going back to the camps , which shelter 1.4 million people in and near @entity0			0
there , hygiene , sanitation and clean water are hard to come by -- conditions that are conducive to further spread of the illness			0
if @entity1 's cholera epidemic follows a pattern similar to that of the last cholera epidemic in the @entity301 , it could produce hundreds of thousands of additional cases over the next several years , dr. @entity294 , deputy director of the @entity295 , told reporters last week			1
" we have to prepare for a large upsurge in cases , " @entity294 said			0
" we have to be prepared with all the resources that are needed for a rapid response			0
" the hemisphere 's last cholera epidemic began in @entity311 in 1991 and spread to some 16 other countries , from @entity313 to @entity314 , he said			1
from 1991 to 1997 , @entity311 alone saw more than 650,000 cases			0
a similar pattern in @entity1 could produce some 270,000 cases , which means public health officials likely face long - term challenges in @entity1			0
" the bacteria have a foothold in the rivers and the water system , so it will be there for a number of years , " he said			0
still , he said , the cholera epidemic need not interfere with the @entity1 general elections scheduled for november 28			0
" there is no reason to expect the elections to have a negative impact on the cholera epidemic , " said @entity294			0
" and in fact , the @entity333 is planning to use the occasion to disseminate prevention messages to the population			2
it will help prevent the spread of infection			0
" the @entity25 , which has appealed to international donors for $ 164 million in aid , said it anticipates as many as 200,000 people to be sickened with cholera over the next six to 12 months			1
a @entity295 spokeswoman acknowledged that such estimates are " guesses			0
" symptoms of cholera , an acute , bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water , can be mild or even nonexistent			0
but sometimes they can be severe : leg cramps , profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting , which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration , shock and death			0
such an outbreak would be unlikely to occur in a developed country like the @entity198 because it has water - treatment facilities and sewage systems , according to the @entity197 's @entity203			2
" we may get imported cases , but they 're not going to take hold and turn into an outbreak			0
it 's just not as likely , " he said			2
@entity2 's @entity371 contributed to this story from @entity0 .			2
