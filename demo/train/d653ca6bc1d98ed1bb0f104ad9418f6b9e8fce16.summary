-- poachers have decimated elephant populations across @entity3 and parts of @entity5 , killing thousands of animals for their revered ivory			2
yet in @entity9 , home to some 7,000 wild @entity5 elephants , a different , more hopeful story is playing out			1
it 's a story that 's attracting truckloads of tourists from around the world to witness a stunning wildlife spectacle , simultaneously raising concerns among conservationists about how increasing numbers of visitors may be impacting the large mammals			1
in north - central @entity9 's @entity22 , hundreds of elephants travel each year to the shores of an ancient reservoir built by a king more than 1,700 years ago			1
they 've made the trip for centuries , coming from across the region to bathe , mate , socialize and , most importantly , to feed as part of an annual event known as " @entity32			0
" during the dry season ( july through early november ) , the water in the reservoir recedes			1
in its place , lush green grasses grow , providing a veritable feast for the hungry pachyderms			0
between meals , the elephants head into the reservoir , spraying themselves with the shallow , muddy waters to create one of the world 's biggest pool parties			1
" where else you can get so close to so many wild elephants at once ? " asks @entity48 , a lawyer visiting @entity32 from @entity49			1
" watching massive herds of elephants bathe as the sun sets over the nearby mountains is an experience i 'll never forget			1
" would you pay us $ 50 for a cup of elephant dung coffee ? conservation concerns if you have n't heard of @entity32 or ever seriously considered visiting @entity9 , you 're not alone			1
the island nation 's prolonged civil war , which ended in may 2009 , kept the country off most people 's itineraries			0
since then , however , word of @entity9 's diverse wildlife , spectacular beaches and myriad cultural activities has spread : in 2012 , tourist arrivals grew 17.5 percent over 2011 , hitting 1,055,605 , according to government officials			1
while the growth has boosted tourism - related revenue , the volume of visitors to @entity22 -- and the @entity75 required to transport them through the park -- has caught the attention of wildlife conservationists			1
they worry added traffic is negatively impacting not only the fragile reserve , but also the health and behavior of the animals the visitors are traveling to see			1
" the increasing number of vehicles in the park and the unruly behavior of most are cause for much concern , " says @entity90 , president of the @entity9 @entity91 ( @entity92 )			1
" vehicles approach elephants too closely and disrupt them from feeding , mating , nursing and socializing			2
in addition , they are habituating elephants to charge vehicles , which they will continue to do once they leave the national park with the beginning of the rains			2
" on a safari i joined earlier this year , i experienced these issues firsthand			2
during our trip , the tour driver inadvertently parked in the path of a mother and baby elephant , obstructing their way to a watering hole			0
when a nearby bull elephant took notice , he quickly moved in to protect them , charging our vehicle in the process			0
our driver reacted quickly and moved us to safety			0
@entity90 and others fear it 's only a matter of time before someone 's luck runs out and an elephant or tourists are seriously injured			0
conservationists are pushing government and park officials to ensure animals , humans and the local environment are better protected			2
recommendations include implementing stringent policies to govern how visitors and guides behave in the park , as well as providing training for rangers and drivers on how to conduct themselves while in the presence of wild elephants			2
drivers would need certification to take visitors to the park , and they could face fines if caught violating park regulations			0
tracking the elephants additional proposals include documenting the movement of the elephants beyond @entity165 's unfenced borders			2
environmental organizations also hope to map the entire ecological cycle of the animals as part of efforts to ensure the slaughters occurring in places like @entity3 and @entity173 do n't happen in @entity9			1
meanwhile , the @entity174 is pinning its hopes on the continued success of @entity32 , even building specific marketing activities around the annual event in an effort to attract more visitors to @entity165			0
in 2011 , officials christened september " @entity186 , " distributing full - color brochures that proclaimed @entity32 " one of the most unforgettable and fantastic events in the international wildlife calendar			2
" as word about @entity165 's main attraction spreads , the hope is that massive herds of elephants will continue migrating to the park each dry season , as they have for hundreds of years			1
as long as they do , it 's a safe bet that more and more tourists will travel to @entity9 to experience what truly is one of the world 's greatest wildlife events			1
@entity22 is about 180 kilometers from @entity201 , a four - hour drive			0
the best time to see the gathering is during the dry season , from june to september			0
a number of local operators offer day trips to the area , which can be arranged from your hotel			0
accommodation options include resorts and bungalows just a few kilometers outside the national park			0
at the high end of the price stick is luxury tented camp @entity217			0
for those who would rather have the whole trip arranged for them , tour companies like @entity220 offer multi-day packages including airfare			0
residents of @entity227 , the @entity228 and the @entity229 are required to apply for a tourist visa before arrival in @entity9			1
applications can be made online .			0
