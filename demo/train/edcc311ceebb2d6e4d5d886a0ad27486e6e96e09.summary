-- doing 75 mph down a winding canyon on an otherwise calm afternoon evoked some discomfort from my then - fiance passenger , white - knuckling his door handle			1
" am i making you nervous , sweetie ? " i asked			2
i was enjoying the speed thrill and was acutely aware that he was not			2
" not really , " he managed to squeak			2
but we were a month and a half away from the " biggest day " of our lives , and i knew better			2
the nerves were starting to fray a bit			2
five seconds of silence before he said : " i just do n't want anything to happen to us before the wedding			1
" and there it is			2
the very sentence that summarizes what i like to call " @entity24 " -- an alternative reality not elicited by drugs , engaged in by the weak of heart , nor entered often by choice			1
a place where you believe , unequivocally , that the universe does revolve around you			2
a place that gave me some sympathy for the narcissists in my life			2
this frame of mind is entirely limiting			2
there is no time to enjoy a beautiful sunset when you 've got to put lotion on your skin for the fifth time that day			2
i love my husband dearly			2
i wanted to get married , and i think , as an observer , weddings are beautiful occasions			0
everyone is smiling , and if they 're crying it 's because they 're so very happy			1
weddings are inspirational events , evoking notions of summer evenings , blushing brides , silly pranks by younger brothers and pretty bridesmaids all in a row			0
that 's what a wedding is all about , right ? i was the sort of bride - to - be who prided herself on not capitulating to the capitalist wedding - day requirements			1
yes , i know that the average @entity70 wedding costs a staggering $ 28,000 , but those " free spirits " who serve @entity73 and @entity75 cakes at their soirees did n't seem that bad to me			1
i was certain that i would not lose sight of what the occasion was all about : marrying the man i love			0
four months before our big day , after we moved into a house large enough to accommodate a polygamist family , i realized things were getting out of hand			0
it was n't explicitly said , but we chose that house knowing his family and friends were coming into town and would not be impressed by our basement apartment			1
we chose that house to have a big - ass rehearsal dinner			0
people do crazy stuff in @entity24			1
soon i was faced with such " heavy " decisions as : reserved or open seating ? band or @entity98 ? one or two entrees ? veil or no veil ? roses or tulips ? 6:00 or 6:30 ? guitar player or violinist ? @entity107 's " @entity106 " or " @entity108 " ? sanity or nuthouse ? after all was said and done , our wedding was wonderful			1
i have the best husband a woman could ask for , but it turned out that leaving @entity24 was not so easy			1
as part of my 12 - step @entity24 cessation program , it helped me to identify six fairly distinct phases of this common affliction -- and laugh at our silly ways			1
phase 1 : the post-engagement high this is a blissful , short - lived period when the wedding still feels like an exotic , far - off event			0
" yay , we 're getting married ! " you and your partner bat around loose ideas about what sort of wedding you each want ( " oh , maybe we can get married in @entity134 ! " ) and leave it at that , which brings me to the next phase			0
phase 2 : denial for two for me , this lasted too long -- about five months of our nine - month engagement			1
toward the end of this phase , a mutual friend said over drinks at a bar , " you know what i love about you guys ? that you never talk about your wedding			0
engaged couples get so consumed and you guys are n't like that at all			1
" her comments made me , um , think about things			0
phase 3 : reality bites in this phase you collide with the fact that you 're essentially throwing the largest party of your life for the most important people in your life			1
and you realize you want very badly for this party to go extremely well			0
we picked out invitations and tasted cakes as if @entity172 were on the guest list			0
we scoured weddings sites as though our very lives depended on finding the perfect location -- would people prefer the view of a mountain or a beautiful garden ? -- and went to @entity181 to taste wines			1
ok , this one was an excuse to take a break from this phase , which boils down to a package of stress with the delivery date pounding your brain every minute			1
phase 4 : crunch time this phase , mere weeks away from the main event , was actually more bearable for me			0
my fiance and i talked as if we were planning a military operation : " i 've got the flowers covered , the @entity201 are coming in and we should have a final count by tuesday at 16:00 , but the backyard is the fly in the ointment			1
" the wedding loomed larger than ever , but we were too busy to stress about it			0
phase 5 : the big day this is the phase @entity24 folks live for			1
it is the height of @entity24 , the reason you do it all			1
it absolutely amazes me how wonderful this phase was			0
there were pretty bridesmaids all in a row and it was a summer evening			0
no silly pranks were played , but we danced the night away and love was all around us			0
still , it 's ironic that this is the shortest phase			1
we spent how many months planning -- for a five - hour event ? phase 6 : post-honeymoon detox this last phase is much less stressful , but definitely the silliest			1
my husband and i actually volunteered to videotape and @entity98 a friend 's wedding one week after we returned from our honeymoon			1
we double - handedly sought to make it an affair to remember			0
i gave a toast in front of 250 people , of whom i knew approximately 15			0
my husband became @entity98 and announcer			0
we danced to every song , hoping to inspire people to get footloose			0
i think our freakish , post-wedding energy scared and confused guests as they remained firmly planted in their seats			0
despite the stomach knots , obsessive thoughts and money squandering , @entity24 is ultimately a difficult place to leave			1
if you know people who are in this alternative reality , cut them some slack			2
their days are strange and their logic skewed			0
do n't be afraid to approach them when they 're poring over wedding pictures like dealers with a new load of premium cocaine			2
you 'll get your friends or loved ones back , and when it 's your turn to get married they 'll be there to help you			1
and you 'll be glad that they are			0

when @entity283 got engaged , she did n't anticipate what it would do to her brain
she calls this state " @entity24 , " an alternate reality where planning takes over
there 's a lot of bliss involved -- right before the freakout sets in
she finds most engaged couples go through it and find their way back to *normalcy*
