-- when convicted intelligence leaker @entity2 asked thursday for hormone treatment at a military prison so he can become @entity2 , the response was immediate : no. so would the former @entity6 private have a better shot at becoming a woman if he were transferred to a civilian prison , a move his lawyer has suggested he might attempt ? maybe			1
but he should get ready for a fight			2
recently , federal courts in some states , including @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , have authorized hormone treatment for inmates at government expense , ruling that it 's part of an inmate 's right to adequate medical care guaranteed by the 8th amendment			1
but no prisoner has undergone state - sponsored gender reassignment surgery , according to dr. @entity30 , the former @entity32 medical director			1
he consults nationally on prison health - care issues , particularly concerning transgender inmates			1
he evaluated his first transgender inmate in 1989			2
" these kind of requests are so rare -- few compared to the thousands in the system -- so corrections employees do n't have a lot of experience or training , " he said			2
" and the prison system in this country has a history of being old - fashioned , puritanical , " he said			1
a correctional staffer is more likely to think that a male inmate acting like a woman is doing that out of defiance or acting out			2
" only lately , i think , has there been some understanding that medical science says that this treatment is , in some cases , as critical as giving an inmate his heart medication or dialysis			2
" @entity59 wants to be @entity60 the only inmate close to getting a state - covered sex change is @entity63			1
she was @entity63 , a laborer who was convicted of murdering his wife in 1990 and given a life sentence without parole			1
@entity63 began asking for hormone therapy in 1992 , arguing that he felt debilitating depression and wanted to kill himself			1
" she could n't look in the mirror , " said his lawyer , @entity70			2
" she felt trapped in her own body			0
she was not a man , despite having the genitals of a man			0
" doctors diagnosed @entity63 with gender identity disorder , a condition listed in the @entity80 's @entity79 , a book of classifications of mental disorders widely used by @entity84 mental health professionals			1
the newest edition , the @entity85 , now calls the condition gender dysphoria , but it 's essentially the same symptoms : intense confusion and strain over one 's gender			1
5 things to know about gender identity @entity63 was eventually given estrogen and other drugs , @entity70 said , but when she asked for surgery , many @entity19 officials fiercely opposed funding the operation , which the @entity100 has reported could cost $ 50,000			1
in 2008 , @entity101 state sen. @entity101 filed legislation to ban the use of taxpayer money to pay for the surgery			0
" we have many big challenges facing us as a nation , but nowhere among those issues would i include providing sex change surgery to convicted murderers , " @entity101 said , according to the @entity100			1
" i look forward to common sense prevailing and the ruling being overturned			0
" more than 20 state lawmakers sent a letter to the state 's prisons chief saying they did not support providing @entity63 a state - funded operation			1
in september 2012 , two decades after @entity63 first requested treatment , @entity84 district judge @entity120 ruled that the state must pay for the surgery , citing the 8th amendment			0
while other judges across the country had ordered corrections departments to provide drugs and psychotherapy to gender - confused inmates , he was the first to order that the state pay for surgery			1
the government is in the process of appealing the ruling , and @entity63 remains , anatomically , a man			0
" @entity60 understands that to get this far is a very big deal			0
it 's precedent - setting , " @entity70 said			1
" to go from not being able to look in the mirror to feeling trapped in her own body to knowing that there is chance to fully transition , i think her mental state has improved			0
" read more about the @entity149 case @entity150 wants to be @entity151 a @entity17 inmate is close to getting a similar ruling			0
in 2004 , inmate @entity154 , serving 73 years for bank robbery , was able to reach a settlement with the state 's corrections department that allowed her to receive hormones behind bars			1
@entity154 was going by @entity151 and , with permission from correctional officials , styling herself like a woman , wearing makeup and tweezing her eyebrows			0
according to a court document ( @entity168 ) , she was seeing a prison therapist about her incessant urges to rid herself of the genitalia she was born with			1
she kept telling prison officials that she felt overwhelmed			1
eventually , @entity151 could n't take it anymore			0
she bought disposable razor blades at the prison commissary and tried to cut her penis off			1
after her hospitalization , she filed a federal lawsuit in 2011 , claiming that the state failed to provide adequate medical care because it refused to give her a sex change operation			1
in january , the 4th @entity84 @entity182 found that @entity151 can argue that denying her the surgery violates the @entity185 's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment			1
as @entity151 's case makes its way through the courts , there could be more to come across the nation			1
in 2012 , the @entity192 updated its health care policy to include transgender inmates			0
@entity192 spokesman @entity195 said officials would not be giving interviews on the topic , but he forwarded its patient policy ( @entity168 ) , which says an inmate has the right to an evaluation to determine whether treatment is necessary			0
a unstudied population correctional professionals know little about how many inmates like @entity151 or @entity63 are inside @entity84 prisons			0
that could be a big problem , some experts say , because transgender people are more likely to wind up in the criminal justice system than others in the general population , and they are at higher risk for security problems behind bars			0
the @entity219 and the @entity220 published a 2011 report based on a survey of 6,450 people who identified as transgender or gender - nonconforming			2
sixteen percent said that they had been compelled to make a living illegally , such as prostitution or selling drugs , due to discrimination that led to bad work environments , loss of a job , poverty and other tough situations			0
once in jail or prison , those people reported that they had been physically or sexually assaulted because of their gender issue			1
a 2007 @entity242 , @entity241 study found that people who identify as transgender are 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison			2
there were 1.6 million inmates in state and federal prisons in 2011 , according to the @entity250			0
yet only a few studies appear to have been done on identifying prisoners who are transgender			0
a 2009 study of @entity256 's men 's prisons identified more than 330 transgender inmates -- people born as men but identifying as women -- out of a population of approximately 160,000			2
more than 80 % of the inmates said they live as women before being prisoners , and nearly half had lived on the streets			0
these figures are partly why , in 2011 , authorities in the @entity269 area began housing transgender detainees based on the gender they identify with rather than the one they were born with , according to the @entity273			2
transgender detainees at the @entity275 are allowed to meet with a panel of doctors and therapists to determine where they should be housed , and correctional employees are instructed to let transgender inmates wear clothing or use hygiene products that they feel suit their gender			2
corrections employees are also trained in how to interact with transgender people			0
a similar program was implemented in @entity288 last year			0
when an arrested person is booked , they are evaluated to determine where they should be placed : a female or male housing unit , taking into consideration which gender the person lives as			1
" it seemed like a no - brainer to us to have this both from a security standpoint and to make the people who come through the justice system feel like they are being treated equally , " @entity288 undersheriff @entity297 said			0
" and it 's saved us a lot of money , " he explained			2
" before this , we had to have 23 - hour lockdowns to protect someone vulnerable			0
this made more sense , and with training , it was fairly simple to get off the ground			0

convicted intel leaker @entity2 has said he is female
the @entity6 has refused to provide hormone therapy for gender reassignment
his attorney has suggested he may attempt to move to civilian prison
it 's not certain he would have a better shot at a sex change there
