@entity0 -- a @entity4 company has reapplied for a permit to build the @entity6 that would connect the tar sands oil development in northern @entity8 to the @entity10 @entity9 , the @entity2 announced friday			1
@entity11 wants a permit for a section of the pipeline that would run from the @entity4 border to connect to an existing pipeline in @entity17 , @entity18 , according to a @entity2 statement			2
the issue has become a political football in the @entity10 , with republicans accusing the @entity24 administration of delaying the project in an election year to placate the environmental lobby			1
@entity22 , including presumptive presidential nominee @entity28 , say the issue shows that @entity24 's energy policies are harming economic growth			1
the administration says republicans are trying to force approval of the pipeline project before necessary review has been completed			1
earlier this year , the @entity2 , which has authority over permits for international pipelines , rejected @entity11 's first application because it lacked an alternate route to avoid a vital aquifer in @entity18			0
last month , @entity11 proposed an alternate route through @entity18 , and state officials say it will take six to nine months to fully review it			1
in its statement friday , the @entity2 said it was " committed to conducting a rigorous , transparent and thorough review			0
" " we will begin by hiring an independent third - party contractor to assist the department , including reviewing the existing @entity52 ( @entity52 ) from the prior @entity6 pipeline review process , as well as identifying and assisting with new analysis , " the @entity2 's statement said			2
it said that previous estimates for a final decision on the 1,700 - mile pipeline -- intended to carry between 500,000 and 700,000 barrels of crude oil a day -- targeted the first quarter of 2013			2
last year , the @entity24 administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until 2013 , citing concerns raised by @entity18 officials and environmental groups about the original route near the @entity68 , which provides drinking water for much of @entity18 and is important for the state 's agricultural economy			1
republicans accused @entity24 of putting off the issue until after the november election , then forced the addition of a provision to speed up approval of the project in the december debt ceiling agreement despite warnings by @entity24 that the 60 - day timeline for a decision would guarantee rejection			1
the @entity2 turned down the application in february , and @entity11 then proposed a new route through @entity18			0
supporters , including the oil industry , say the pipeline would create jobs and reduce the country 's dependence on oil imported from volatile regions			2
@entity95 leaders have continued pressuring @entity24 and @entity96 to speed approval of the pipeline , saying the project has already undergone several years of review			1
the @entity101 , which advocates for the oil industry , called friday for the government to approve the new permit application without further review			1
" the earth has n't moved , the geology has n't changed , the information remains the same , so there should be no reason for a re-review , " said @entity106 vice president @entity106			0
" the pipeline will be @entity114 and has already been thoroughly examined for more than three years , including three environmental assessments			0
" opponents , including environmentalists , say that the pipeline might leak and that it would lock the @entity10 into a particularly dirty form of crude oil that might ultimately end up being exported anyway			1
@entity121 of the @entity122 called friday for a thorough review of the new application that examines the proposed pipeline as well as the merits of tar sands oil development			2
" the world of oil and our understanding of the dangers of tar sands have changed since the first time @entity11 applied for a permit for @entity6 back in 2008 , " @entity121 wrote on the group 's website			2
" the process for evaluating this permit request needs to be thorough , rigorous , transparent and free from conflicts of interest			1
" @entity24 announced in march that he would approve the southern portion of the pipeline , which runs from @entity144 , @entity145 -- a key repository of @entity10 oil -- to the @entity9			1
he had said he was always in favor of permitting that portion , even when the administration blocked the full project			0
currently , there are not enough pipelines to take the oil being produced in @entity4 and @entity155 to refineries and terminals on the @entity9			0
that means @entity160 refineries can pay lower prices to get it			0
giving the @entity4 oil easier access to the @entity9 means the glut in the @entity160 goes away , making it more expensive for the region , but it would increase the amount of that oil available to global markets			0
@entity170 , director of the @entity171 of @entity172 , told @entity1 last month that it will take at least six months for the state to fully review the alternate route proposed by @entity11			2
@entity170 , a @entity95 who is a political appointee , said the first step would be public hearings			0
@entity11 will then consider that feedback to determine the specifics of the proposed alternate route , he said			0
once @entity11 submits that final proposal to his department , it should take 30 to 60 days for the review to be completed and a draft supplemental impact statement prepared , @entity170 said			0
@entity1 's @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
