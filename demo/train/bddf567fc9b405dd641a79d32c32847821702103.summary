@entity0 -- the @entity2 and @entity3 attract crowds of cameramen and hoards of press photographers everywhere they go -- even when they are n't really there			1
wax models of @entity10 and @entity3 went on display at @entity12 in @entity0 wednesday , and were immediately swamped by onlookers keen to get close to the " royal couple			1
" the figures , which cost more than $ 230,000 each to make , are shown in copies of the outfits they wore when they announced their engagement in november 2010 , complete with a replica of the ring once worn by @entity10 's mother @entity22			1
" since the royal wedding , guests from all around the world have been asking where is @entity26 ? we want to come and have our photo taken with her , " said @entity12 spokeswoman @entity27			2
" so we 've recreated the iconic moment where they announced to the world that they are in love with each other			0
" a team of artists and model makers spent four months working on the couple			1
@entity3 's hair alone took six weeks , each individual strand of real , ethically - sourced human hair inserted by hand			2
" it 's really important for us that when people come and stand next to them , that they are seeing a piece of that real person , " said @entity27			0
unlike the subjects of most other @entity12 waxworks , the company said @entity10 and @entity3 did not " sit " for their figures , but @entity54 provided all the key measurements , and the finished pieces have been given the royal seal of approval			1
other versions of the models will go on display at @entity12 ' attractions in @entity63 and @entity64 , and in @entity65 , in northern @entity66			1
in each city , " @entity3 " will be shown in a different outfit : a lilac @entity71 gown worn on the couple 's @entity73 tour in @entity64 , a black lace @entity77 dress worn to a film premiere in @entity63 , and a @entity80 gown worn at a charity dinner in @entity65			1
early reactions to the new figures suggest they are set to prove almost as popular as the real thing			0
" unfortunately i do n't think we 'll ever get to meet the real ones , " one visitor told @entity1			0
" this is definitely a good substitute			0
" " it 's great , " said another			0
" i ca n't see the difference between them and the real people			0
" @entity93 was born @entity93 in @entity94 in 1761 , and learned to sculpt wax as a teenager -- her early subjects included @entity98 and @entity99 -- and went on to become a favorite of @entity101 and @entity102			2
during the @entity103 , she was imprisoned , and later commissioned to create death masks of many of those put to death on the guillotine			0
in 1802 , she brought her waxworks to @entity110 and toured the country before settling in @entity0 , where she lived until her death in 1850 .			2
