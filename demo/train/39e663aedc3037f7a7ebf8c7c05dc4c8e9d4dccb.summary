-- @entity1 is known as the undisputed king of clay with seven @entity5 titles to his name -- but the @entity7 was given an almighty scare in the quarterfinals of the @entity11 masters friday			1
@entity1 , who has won the past eight editions of the tournament , was made to fight all the way by @entity16 's @entity15 before eventually prevailing 6 - 2 2 - 6 6 - 4			1
it was the first time the 26 - year - old had dropped a set at the tournament since 2009 as he racked up a 45th consecutive match victory in the @entity23 principality			1
that record had looked in doubt until his opponent began to suffer with cramp in his leg , allowing @entity1 to emerge victorious			1
but despite working his way back to fitness following a seven month absence with a knee injury , @entity1 admits he still lacks match sharpness			1
" i did n't play tennis for seven months , " he told reporters			2
" i 'm losing little bit intensity of the match for moments			0
" that 's normal after being a lot of time outside of the competition			2
i played for a month , then i stopped for another month			0
i need time to play with top rhythm for the whole match			2
" i was playing great at the first set , playing my best level			0
so that 's the most important thing			2
" @entity1 was spotted playing with taping on his back , but he refused to elaborate on the problem when asked			1
he added : " i 'm happy to be in the semifinals , i played the best with what i had			0
it 's normal have problems on the back , on the shoulder , on the elbow			2
" @entity15 , 21 , is rated as one of the most exciting prospects in world tennis and for a while looked set to become the first man to defeat @entity1 in @entity11 since 2003			1
the 11 - time grand slam winner was given a stern examination by the man ranked 34 in the world , who eventually succumbed after suffering pain in his left leg			0
" it 's a tough loss , i think i gave everything i had today , " @entity15 told reporters			2
" today he obviously showed why he 's the best not only on that surface , i believe , but he 's one of the best out there			0
" @entity1 will now face @entity23 's @entity75 , who saw off @entity76 2 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 4 in his quarterfinal tie			1
@entity76 , who defeated @entity78 in the previous round , fought off four match points before eventually being swept aside			0
" it 's an incredible challenge , " @entity75 told reporters of his upcoming contest with @entity1			1
" he 's won eight times here			0
anything i might achieve will be just a bonus for me			0
" i no longer have any pain in my legs , because i know i 'm going to play a player that 's a lot better than i am on clay			1
" i do have some weapons ; i have everything to win and nothing to lose			0
" top seed @entity97 overcame his troublesome ankle problem to see off @entity101 's @entity100 6 - 4 6 - 3			1
" my ankle is getting better and better , " @entity97 told reporters			0
" the pain is subsiding and that is very important for me			0
i just hope to play a good match tomorrow			0
" the @entity107 will face @entity109 's @entity108 in the last four after he defeated @entity23 's @entity110 in straight sets .			1
