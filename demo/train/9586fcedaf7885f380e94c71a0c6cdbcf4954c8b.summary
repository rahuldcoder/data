-- @entity2 electronics company @entity1 caused a worldwide stir when it announced its 55 - inch oled panel last week , and now the company has rolled out two more pictures that show you what kind of remarkable tv set this is going to be			1
how groundbreaking is this tv , anyway ? if you 've ever seen an oled screen , all of which are much smaller than this one , you 'll know how outlandishly vibrant its colors are			1
and an @entity20 screen can be impossibly thin			0
for instance , the one you see here is only 4mm thick -- take a look at the right side of the picture and you 'll see the woman 's finger pointing at the edge of the screen			0
on its official @entity33 , @entity1 says this screen 's color is even more vibrant because of its four - color pixels , making its picture more natural and accurate than other @entity20			1
each tiny pixel emits red , green , blue and white , instead of the red / green / blue used in the pixels of other oled sets and most other tv sets manufactured today			2
does that make a noticeable difference ? we 'll take a close look at this screen and others like it at the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) next week and give you our first - hand impressions			0
the oled screen ( organic light - emitting diode , read more about oled technology here ) is nothing new , but here 's the innovation : until now , it 's been difficult to create the screens in a size this big , at a reasonable cost and with a long - enough lifespan			1
the problem with this announcement is , @entity1 is not saying when this screen will be available , how much it will cost , or how long it will last			1
so will this be yet another spectacular @entity50 demo of a product that will never make it into the homes of real - world consumers ? from what we 've seen , @entity1 is serious about its oled manufacturing , where it invested $ 226 million in mid- 2010 to create a new production facility , tripling its oled capacity			1
many other manufacturers are whispering about oled screens			2
there are already smaller oled screens available now , albeit at exorbitant prices			2
there are small oled screens on millions of smartphones			2
this is not science fiction , folks			0
the promising fact : huge oled screens can be printed onto razor - thin surfaces using a process akin to an inkjet printer , theoretically making them even cheaper to produce than today 's lcd and plasma screens			1
and the screens have much faster response time , with refresh rates that could ( again , theoretically ) reach 100,000 hz			0
they 're brighter , lighter ( this 55 - inch screen weighs 16.5 lb ) , and can even be flexible			0
no question about it : you 're looking at the tv the future , and the question is not if we 'll see these screens available in large sizes and affordable prices , but when			0
