-- three dead bodies , 20 to 30 missing limbs , and more than 180 injured can force us to revisit that age - old question : what is the state of man 's nature ? is he inherently good or evil ? the @entity11 bombings have presented us with the dilemma of @entity13 versus @entity14 again			1
pictures like this tempt us to adopt @entity14 ' pessimistic view of man			1
events such as this , or rather men responsible for events such as this , do n't define us			1
actor @entity28 , in a @entity27 post that i 'm sure has virally made it to your screen , put it perfectly : " if it 's one person or a hundred people , that number is not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the population on this planet			1
" and : " the vast majority stands against that darkness and , like white blood cells attacking a virus , they dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evil doers and , more importantly , the damage they wreak			2
this is beyond religion or creed or nation			2
we would not be here if humanity were inherently evil			2
we 'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago			2
" and more : " so when you spot violence , or bigotry , or intolerance , or fear , or just garden - variety misogyny , hatred or ignorance , just look it in the eye and think , ' the good outnumber you , and we always will			2
at least , that 's what i think			0
what about you ? which is it ? is man inherently good or evil ? it 's an admittedly oversimplified question			1
but how you answer it dictates what you do next			0
@entity78 , @entity79 define us @entity78 is being hailed as a cowboy - hatted hero			1
with the bomb blasts still ringing in his ears , @entity78 dove into the carnage and began to help victims			0
i think he says more about us than whoever dropped a pressure cooker at the marathon on monday			0
it 's @entity79 , though , whom i keep thinking about			0
@entity79 is the man who was standing on @entity92 watching his girlfriend run the @entity11			1
@entity79 is the man who in one moment was standing with youthful invincibility and two legs			1
and in the next moment , he was lying without legs			0
he 's the man @entity78 stayed with until he was in an ambulance			1
there 's something about these two men , this moment that defines us			0
yes , it 's @entity78 's heroism			0
but it 's also @entity79 's gaze			0
he 's literally three - quarters the person he was minutes before			0
and yet he almost calmly looks forward			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity111 .			1

@entity111 : the @entity11 bombings make us wonder about the nature of man
he says such events , or rather those responsible , do n't define us
