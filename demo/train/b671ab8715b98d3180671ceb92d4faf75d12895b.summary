@entity0 -- a top executive with @entity3 insists @entity4 is a " bigger " artist than @entity5			1
@entity6 , testifying wednesday at the wrongful death trial of @entity3 , also downplayed how many tickets @entity5 could have sold if he had not died while preparing for his comeback concerts			1
@entity3 lawyers are challenging an entertainment expert hired by @entity5 lawyers who estimated the @entity5 would have earned $ 1.5 billion touring the world before his 66th birthday had he not died from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic at age 50			1
@entity5 's mother and three children contend the company is liable for damages because it hired , retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in his death			1
if jurors agree , they could then use estimates of @entity5 's lost earnings as a guide to determine how much @entity3 -- the promoter and producer of his " @entity33 " tour -- must pay the @entity34 in damages			1
@entity3 lawyers argue that @entity5 -- not its executives -- chose and controlled dr. @entity38 , the doctor who signed a $ 150,000 a month contract with the company to serve as @entity5 's doctor for the tour			1
@entity3 executives never signed the contract , which @entity38 returned to them just hours before @entity5 's death			1
a nurse anesthetist will testify thursday about administering anesthesia to @entity5 during a medical procedure			1
he will be the first of what @entity3 lead lawyer @entity49 said would be a parade of " many , many " medical professionals who treated @entity5			2
the company will try to prove that @entity5 was a secretive drug addict , which prevented promoters from knowing about the dangers he faced under @entity38 's care			2
@entity3 tries to show @entity5 had secret drug addiction @entity6 , who has been a concert promoter since the 1970s , is the ceo of @entity3 , the division of @entity3 that was in charge of @entity5 's tour			1
he was the first witness called as the company began presenting its defense in the 13th week of the trial			0
much of his testimony was focused on attacking the analysis of certified public accountant @entity67 , who testified last week that he was " reasonably certain " that @entity5 would have performed 260 shows around the world as part of his " @entity33 " tour			2
he would have earned $ 890 million over the three years of concerts in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity67 said			2
@entity5 would have earned at least $ 1.5 billion from touring , endorsements and sponsorships had he lived to age 66 , @entity67 said			1
@entity67 's analysis suggested @entity5 would stage many of his shows in large stadiums , with more than 90,000 fans buying tickets to many of the concerts			2
but @entity6 testified that his experience told him that no stadiums would seat that many people for @entity5 's kind of show			1
the @entity93 estimates were inflated by about 30 % , @entity6 testified			0
the @entity94 would only seat 60,000 , @entity6 said			0
although @entity95 reported that @entity96 performed for 97,000 people in the @entity98 , @entity99 , venue in 2009 , @entity6 said he was " trusting my gut " that the numbers were inflated			0
" i know how those numbers can be manipulated , " he said			0
@entity5 lead lawyer @entity105 noted that 98,000 people were in the @entity94 seats when @entity5 performed the halftime show for @entity109 27 in 1993			0
@entity5 's mom faces cross examination @entity6 also contested @entity67 's suggestion that @entity5 would have taken his tour to @entity114 for at least three shows			1
" nobody goes to @entity114 , " he said			0
he later acknowledged that @entity5 performed there during his history tour			0
" it 's not a very big market , " @entity6 said of @entity114 , which is home to about 1.25 billion people			2
@entity6 also disagreed with what one of his superiors , @entity3 ceo @entity3 , wrote in an e-mail that there was enough demand in @entity127 alone to sell out more that 200 @entity5 shows			1
" he believed that , " @entity6 testified			0
" i do n't believe that			0
" fans bought all 750,000 tickets put on sale for 31 shows in march 2009 in just two hours , @entity3 said			0
enough buyers were already registered to sell out another 100 shows , @entity3 wrote			0
@entity6 also disagreed with @entity3 ' opinion that @entity5 was the biggest entertainment artist ever			2
" i do myself personally believe that that is not true , " @entity6 testified wednesday			0
" in my opinion @entity4 is right up there with @entity5 and , to me , she is bigger			0

@entity3 's @entity6 *disputed* an estimate of how much @entity5 could *'ve* earned
an expert said @entity5 would have earned at least $ 1.5 billion had he lived to age 66
if jurors decide @entity3 is liable in @entity5 's death , the estimate could guide damages
