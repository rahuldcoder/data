-- president @entity2 's proposed spending freeze could help him recapture the favor of centrist voters , but critics blast the move as nothing more than political posturing			1
the president is expected to call for a partial , three - year freeze on discretionary spending in his @entity14 address wednesday , according to two senior administration officials			1
the cuts , which @entity2 will say would save $ 250 billion , would not apply to national security spending and would not affect major entitlement programs like @entity19 and @entity20			1
the proposal comes as the president 's poll numbers dip and concerns about the economy and the federal deficit flare			0
it also comes after a shocking election loss for @entity29 in @entity30 , which many have interpreted as an expression of voter frustration with the way @entity35 is handling the economy			0
" i applaud [ @entity2 ] for attempting to have some fiscal restraint , " @entity37 strategist @entity36 said			1
" but at the end of the day , he 's got to make sure the @entity29 are disciplined and they do n't have big spending programs alongside of this			2
" under @entity2 's plan , all federal discretionary spending would be frozen at its current level of $ 447 billion per year			1
individual federal agencies would have the power to give some programs increases , while cutting money elsewhere			0
both chambers of @entity50 would have to approve the freeze when they take up the president 's budget for fiscal year 2011 , which starts in october			2
@entity2 will send his budget plan to @entity50 after the @entity14			2
@entity56 , an economist and director of @entity58 at @entity59 , said @entity2 's move does n't make much sense , following a year of unprecedented government spending and a $ 787 billion stimulus package			1
" a little bit of disarray , it seems			0
last year , just spend , throw everything into a stimulus package ... and then this year , just across - the - board freeze			2
frankly , the government has to make better choices and better plans than throwing things into a big pot in one year and then freezing across the board the next year , " he said			0
@entity2 dismissed the idea of an across - the - board spending freeze during a presidential debate in october 2008			1
it does n't happen , " then - candidate @entity2 said			1
" in fact , an across - the - board spending freeze is a hatchet , and we do need a scalpel because there are some programs that do n't work at all			1
there are some that are underfunded			0
i want to make sure we 're focused on the programs that work			0
" @entity37 reaction to @entity2 's proposal was split , with some senior @entity37 aides saying it is something they could support , and others saying it did not go nearly far enough			1
" given @entity35 @entity29 ' unprecedented spending binge , this is like announcing you 're going on a diet after winning a pie - eating contest , " said @entity101 , a spokesman for @entity103 minority leader @entity102 , @entity104			0
" will the budget still double the debt over five years and triple it over 10 ? that 's the bottom line			0
" the senior administration officials acknowledged that discretionary spending is only about one - sixth of the entire federal budget , but said the @entity103 believes that cuts need to start somewhere			1
the move is @entity2 's latest step down a path to a more populist message , aimed at reassuring @entity121 nervous about the slow pace of the economic recovery			2
the president on monday proposed nearly doubling the child care tax credit for middle - class families			0
@entity2 is expected to talk about efforts to create more jobs and spur the economy in his speech wednesday			1
@entity131 : deliver your @entity14 address the @entity103 has put a greater emphasis on the economy in the days since @entity29 lost their 60 - seat supermajority in the @entity137			0
@entity37 @entity138 defeated democrat @entity139 in a special election last week to serve the remainder of the late @entity143 's @entity137 term			2
@entity138 capitalized on voter frustrations and captured the independent vote in @entity30 , a @entity29 stronghold			0
" i think that is a wake - up call for everybody in this town , " @entity103 press secretary @entity146 said a day after the election			0
@entity2 's proposal will likely set the stage for a fight with some liberals , but polls suggest it might not be a bad thing for the president to occasionally break ranks			2
a @entity162 survey released monday indicates that seven in 10 @entity121 think that the @entity29 ' loss of their 60 - seat supermajority in the @entity137 is a positive step for the country			0
observers note it will also put @entity37 in a position where they can show if they are willing to meet the president halfway			1
@entity29 strategist @entity171 said tuesday that @entity2 needs to take control of the narrative in order to get back on track			1
" until this administration stands up and says ' this is what we will face , and this is what we did , and this is our strategy ' -- these things are going to continue to happen , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			2
