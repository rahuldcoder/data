@entity0 -- @entity3 's leaders begin a highly - anticipated four - day meeting on saturday that is expected to shed light on the direction the world 's second largest economy is likely to take in coming years			1
the big question for the gathering -- officially called the third plenary session of the 18th @entity12 -- is how hard @entity13 will push for reforms			0
possible changes include an overhaul of tax , land and family planning policies ; solutions to control an explosion in local government debt ; restructuring @entity3 's massive state - owned enterprises ; and looser controls on foreign investment			1
@entity1 's @entity0 bureau chief , @entity26 , spoke to @entity27 , the dean of @entity28 at @entity29 about what to expect : what are the challenges that @entity3 faces now ? the @entity3 economy faces many challenges , in the realms of urbanization , industrial upgrading , changing into more efficient market infrastructure , and reforming the financial sector			1
there are a lot of problems , but many of these are manageable			0
the @entity3 economy is like a race car making a turn			1
you want to be very focused to stay on course and maintain constant speed			1
if you slam on the brake while turning , you may easily lose control and get into trouble			1
but @entity3 's economic growth has been slowing down -- is n't that alarming ? indeed , the @entity3 economy has been slowing down for the past three years but recent data and other evidence suggests this is changing			1
i am pretty optimistic that the @entity3 economy will be back on a relatively strong growth track , and then things will move forward			2
the key is while maintaining a healthy growth rate , we need to further economic reforms			2
what further economic reforms should @entity3 take ? in the very near term , the @entity3 government should focus on the urbanization process and reform the " hukou " ( residence registration ) system -- to make sure that the new migrant workers coming to the cities have equal opportunities to education , jobs , access to social safety nets and public services			1
the other key issue is to improve business environment , and this requires government reforms , so that governments do n't interfere too much , control too much , interfere with the market too much and control resources too much			0
some say that @entity3 needs political reforms as much as it needs to further economic reforms			1
what kind of reform on the political side can we expect ? the economic reforms can not be separated from the political reforms			1
and that is a common understanding in @entity3 now			0
in my view , for @entity3 in the current situation , the most important political reforms are in the government reforms			1
and in the official government documents , it has been made clear that they want to redefine the three relationships : the relationship between the government and the market , letting markets play a more fundamental role in resource allocation ; redefining the relationship between the government and the society , to let social organizations play more important role in society ; and then , redefining the relationship between the central and the local governments , to make sure different levels of government all have the right incentives to push forward healthy economic growth and social progress			0
some say @entity3 must keep the magic " 8 " in gdp growth to sustain economic growth and social stability			2
what do you think ? a certain number of growth rate , like 8 % , is not a magic number			0
in fact , i would suggest that the government should downplay it , or even do n't publish at all the target of gdp growth			0
in a market economy -- for a complex economy like @entity3 -- it is very hard to plan what 's going to be the growth rate for next year , or the next five years			2
the new government is looking for real solutions			2
so changing the behavior of local governments in @entity3 will be the key in changing the growth model			0
starting from the central government , getting rid of the gdp target and then , putting in a systematic package of reform to change the local government 's incentives , so that the local officials will be more focused on how to develop the local business and market , how to improve the environment , how to make the city more liveable and changing their incentives to these areas , instead of trying to attract big projects or getting impressive gdp numbers			0
how worried should we be in terms of @entity3 housing bubble ? how big is it and will it burst ? it is something that we need to be concerned about , but i do n't think the whole housing sector in @entity3 and all housing prices in all of @entity3 cities , are out of control			2
overall , i think , the housing price in large cities is something that we need to be concerned about , but if we handle this issue well , it is a manageable problem , and it will not necessarily lead to a bubble that will eventually burst and will cause all sorts of financial issues			0
how risky is it for @entity3 to be pushing further along market - oriented reform ? when you reform , you meet challenges along the way , you face difficulties			0
in some sense it is more difficult to push forward now than early on , because in these reforms , you need to deal with very complex interest groups , you need to make a lot of compromises and difficult trade - offs			0
that is a difficult thing to do , but not to push forward is even more risky			0
the @entity3 leaders realize the urgency of pushing forward economic reforms			2
how will the coming @entity201 be considered successful ? the meeting will be considered successful if it points to the right direction and take further reforms , lay some cornerstones so that you can clearly see that in the next five to 10 years , the current government will push through series of economic reforms -- so that the @entity3 economy will be on the right developmental and growth track ; so that we that the economy will become more efficient and strong , the society more open and progressive , the government more efficient , less corrupt and more productive in terms of managing the economy and the society .			1
