@entity0 , @entity1 -- surfers beware			1
there is an incredibly influential and vocal group on @entity6 , using a common hashtag and blazing keyboards to ensure their @entity10 country is discussed fairly and with respect online			1
@entity1 on @entity6 , better known as # @entity12 , are a 21st century phenomenon born out of the social media boom and growing economy in @entity17 's most populous city , @entity0			1
why are they so vocal and what is it doing for the country at large ? my mission for " @entity23 " recently was to find out - and i did so with an experiment			2
the concept was simple ; if @entity1 are so connected i should be able to assemble a quick meet - up ; i should be able to navigate @entity0 via @entity6			1
the entire process should teach me how tech - savvy this country really is and show me where its heading			0
it worked far better than expected			0
technically speaking , @entity1 are special , as they are members of an exclusive and enviable club			2
the country is among the top four users of the web in all of @entity17 , behind only @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
what 's more impressive is the connection speed at which they surf			0
the @entity1 government recently installed broadband infrastructure , which behind @entity42 , is the second fastest on the continent			2

for these reasons and more , the response to my call for a random meeting was met with enthusiasm			0
one by one , half a dozen # @entity59 approached me in the predetermined cafe ( offering free @entity61 ) shouting the password , " connected ! " each told me how the internet is making their lives easier from paying bills through a mobile money service called @entity68 or sending out links to their resumes via social media			2
what 's more fascinating is the place they all suggested i visit , @entity75			0
essentially it 's a nexus of innovation with free - flowing ideas meant to serve as an incubator for future @entity1 - grown advancements			1
@entity6 , users gave me advice on how to get there and who to meet			1
i met the manager @entity85 standing amid what appeared to be a college study hall			0
he introduced me to software developers , web designers and tech enthusiasts all at different stages of their @entity50 projects			0
of course there was the obligatory coffee bar , foosball table and comfy gaming seats on the floor -- but there was also a real sense of responsibility for the future and well - being of the country			0

it allows them to check up - to - the - minute market rates for their goods so devious middlemen ca n't deceive them			0
she tells me its especially important for her since she comes from a family of people who make their living on farms			0
another developer , @entity121 showed me a tablet - based application designed for @entity1 's school children called @entity126			1
it brings the country 's academic curriculum to life with pictures , video and interactive quizzes			2
it 's no wonder @entity135 plucked many of @entity75 's members , like @entity138 of the crisis - mapping site @entity140 , to join their @entity10 ranks			1
my final stop on this online experiment was @entity135 's offices in @entity1			1

they include a mapping service keeping the government accountable on schools that it has agreed to build or expand -- the map reveals any progress -- or lack thereof			0
from @entity148 's corner office overlooking @entity0 he tells me of his wish for his young children , " i think they are going to have a much easier life and hopefully ... compete globally even more			1
they do n't have the same hang ups we had , that ' we 're behind '			0
they think they deserve everything and should be doing everything -- that 's the right attitude for young people now			0
" @entity1 online usage has grown exponentially			1
back in the year 2000 only 200,000 were logged onto the web , at the end of 2011 , that number was around 10.5 million			0
no one knows how many internet users - or # @entity59 for that matter - there will be in 2021 but one thing is for sure ; there will be many and they will be helping @entity1 stand out proudly in an increasingly crowded online universe .			1
