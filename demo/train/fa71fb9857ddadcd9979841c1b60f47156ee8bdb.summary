@entity0 -- a @entity3 church notorious for its angry , anti-gay protests at military funerals will continue the controversial practice despite new restrictions in a bill passed by @entity9 that awaits president @entity11 's signature			1
" that 's really not going to change our plans at all , " @entity13 spokesman @entity12 told @entity1 on friday			1
" we 're going to continue to do that			0
we 're also going to continue to obey all laws			0
" the next planned protest is at a military funeral saturday in @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity12 said : " we 'll be out there , doing our thing			1
" under provisions of a comprehensive veterans affairs bill that won final congressional approval tuesday , protesters must be at least 300 feet from military funerals from two hours before they start until two hours after they end			1
violators could face unspecified fines and up to two years in prison			0
" protests that encroach upon the funerals and burials of our fallen soldiers are repugnant and inappropriate -- and they undermine the respect military families and loved ones undeniably deserve , " said a statement by retiring sen. @entity33 , @entity34 , who sponsored the provisions			1
@entity33 , who has complained about the partisan divide in @entity0 , expressed gratitude to @entity9 for passing the bill " to protect the solemn moments of military funerals from outside disruption			1
" the @entity13 church , led by pastor @entity51 , believes @entity52 is punishing the @entity53 for " the sin of homosexuality " through events including soldiers ' deaths			1
members have traveled the country to protest at military funerals and other events , evoking outrage by shouting at grieving families and displaying such signs as " thank @entity52 for dead soldiers , " " @entity52 blew up the troops " and " @entity68 cures fags			1
" " @entity70 has just granted us another round of preaching opportunity here , " @entity12 said , accusing @entity9 of enabling homosexuality with its attempt to " keep @entity75 preaching away from funerals			1
" funerals are one of the few events where " people will take a really serious look at really moral matters of @entity83 , " @entity12 said			2
the purpose of the church 's protests was to influence the people attending the funerals , he added			1
" if you flip off @entity52 , if you disobey the standards of @entity52 , you will incur @entity52 's wrath , " he said			2
" what we 're trying to do is get people to wake up and smell the coffee			0
" the new restrictions expand on provisions in a federal law passed in 2006 that banned protests within 300 feet of national cemeteries from an hour before a funeral to an hour after it , with violators facing fines and up to a year in prison			1
last year , the @entity105 , @entity3 , church won an appeal at the @entity53 @entity107 in a case that tested the competing constitutional rights of free speech and privacy			0
the case involved a protest by @entity13 members outside the 2006 funeral for @entity117 @entity116 in @entity118 , @entity119 , near @entity120			1
@entity116 's family sued the church in 2007 , alleging invasion of privacy , intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy			2
a jury awarded the family $ 2.9 million in compensatory damages plus $ 8 million in punitive damages , which were later reduced to $ 5 million			0
the church appealed the case in 2008 to a federal appeals court , which reversed the judgments a year later , siding with the church 's allegations that its first amendment rights were violated			2
the case then went to the @entity107 , which issued a narrow ruling based on the facts of the specific appeal			0
by an 8 - 1 vote , the high court said members of @entity13 had a right to promote what they call a broad - based message on public matters such as wars			1
a majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the @entity13 church protesters			1
in addition , counter-protesters including bikers and even people dressed as zombies have turned out at some @entity13 church demonstrations			1
@entity12 said a legal challenge to the new restrictions was possible			2
" we 're keeping our options open , " he said			0
" any law that unnecessarily restricts our freedom of religious expression is always going to be open to challenge			0
" he added : " that 's all we care about here			2
we 've got to preach			0
" church members say they believe @entity53 soldiers deserve to die because they fight for a country that tolerates homosexuality			0
the congregation is made up mostly of @entity178 and his family			0
the pastor has 13 children , at least 54 grandchildren and seven great - grandchildren			0
he described himself as an " old - time " gospel preacher in a @entity1 interview in 2006 , saying , " you ca n't preach the @entity75 without preaching the hatred of @entity52			2
" @entity12 said the freedom of expression fight waged by the church benefited all of society , including the news media			0
" it 's in everybody 's best interest , including yours , that those sidewalks remain a platform , a forum for open and robust debate , " he said			0
