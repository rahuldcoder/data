-- is ballet dying ? @entity2 , the 27 - year - old new principal dancer at the @entity3 , says it 's not			1
born in @entity5 , she started dancing at 3 even though no one in her family knew anything about it			2
her love for ballet has taken her touring around the world			1
while ballet is still very much admired , this classical and rigorous art form is no longer enjoying the popularity it once had in its glory heydays			1
" for most of the 20th century , including the entire post-war period , ballet was central to our cultural life			1
now more than ever before it needs to be connected to the culture and the direction we 're heading , " says @entity22 , a dance critic who has written about the history of ballet			1
@entity22 says the tremendous social changes that occurred after the 1990s affected ballet 's cultural prominence			1
the important question now is : what is the place of ballet in a rapidly changing and high - tech society where people like to watch three - minute @entity40 videos or check text messages constantly ? to help revitalize ballet in the 21st century , @entity42 is opening the @entity44 on september 22			1
" the big issue is the future of ballet			1
it is being reinvented as we speak -- and that takes time , talent and resources , " says @entity22 , who is the heading the center			2
with this new ballet think tank , and with dancers like @entity2 who is full of optimism , will ballet leap gracefully into the 22nd century ? @entity58 will tell			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity2 about what it 's like to live and breathe ballet today			1
why should we care about ballet ? ballet is such a unique art form			1
you can say things through dance that you could never express in words , and ballet has the ability to touch people on a deep , abstract level			1
in some ways , ballet is more valuable now than ever			1
everything today is so fast - paced and technologically overloaded -- people are constantly staring into computers or their phone screens for entertainment			1
but going to the theater to see a ballet is unique in that it 's completely live and in the moment -- unfiltered and unedited			1
it 's a real and tangible meditation			1
what sparked your passion for dance ? i was about 11 when i completely fell in love with ballet			1
i was going to this little ballet school situated above a tavern , and we had live piano music , which is really rare for ballet class at that age			1
my teacher would bring a bag full of silk scarves and at the end of each class we would each take one and dance around and improvise to the music			1
it felt so free and was the perfect outlet for my creativity			2
i also loved watching dance movies			1
i loved " @entity110 " and " @entity111			2
" do you have a favorite character ? so far , it 's been @entity115			1
it 's about a girl who falls in love for the first time and she 's on this incredible high , then she gets betrayed and everything comes crashing down			1
she goes completely mad in front of everyone onstage and dies			2
in the second act she comes back as a spirit and finds forgiveness within herself			0
when i performed it this past season , i felt like i became her			0
it was so emotional , and i could feel so much support from the other dancers onstage			0
everyone was invested in the story			0
another favorite role is @entity134 in " @entity135			0
" the @entity137 score is incredible , and i love the animalistic swan imagery			0
it 's a fun challenge to play up the contrast between @entity141 and the @entity142			1
what are the 3 most painful things you 've ever had to do ? most people do n't realize how athletic ballet is -- you have to be so mentally strong to be a dancer			1
one of the toughest things i had to do was act 2 of " @entity135 " when i was in the @entity151			0
you have to stand very still on one leg in a position called b plus for what seems like an eternity , after jumping and doing hard dancing			0
your feet cramp and everything hurts			0
when i first performed it as a teenager , i think i had tears streaming down my face			0
but then you learn how to pace yourself and it becomes more enjoyable			0
another ballet is " @entity165 , " by @entity166			1
it 's definitely one of the hardest things i 've done			1
you get unbelievably tired , to the point that it feels almost impossible to get through			0
i 've seen people throw up in the wings from exhaustion after it			0
it 's the same with @entity177 from " @entity135 "			2
but , i do n't focus on the pain			0
we love what we do			0
and it 's the best feeling when you get through something really physically hard and the curtain comes down and you 've given it your all physically and emotionally			2
how many hours do your dance every day ? on average , i probably dance for 7 to 9 hours a day			2
we start every day with ballet " class , " which is a series of exercises you do to maintain strength and warm up			2
that 's followed by rehearsals and sometimes a performance at night			2
what do you say to people who say ballet is boring ? they 've probably never seen a great ballet with great dancers			2
for instance , if you watch a bad football game it can be boring , too			0
ballet has something for everyone to admire			2
if you do n't like the choreography , you can listen to the music , and if you hate that too , then at least there are beautiful people onstage			0
there are some young choreographers working today like @entity211 , who make ballets that are the farthest thing from boring			0
we are making a dance film together that will come out later this year			2
stay tuned ! do your feet hurt all the time ? actually , no. your feet become accustomed to being en pointe and our pointe shoes are surprisingly supportive , taking the stress off your toes			0
other parts of my body hurt though			0
ironically , the harder i 'm working the less pain i have , because your body gets into crazy shape			0
any indulgences ? i 've been pretty lucky and can eat pretty much whatever i want , especially when we are in season			0
on a show day i always have a bacon egg and cheese sandwich for breakfast			0
i do n't eat a lot of sweets			0
my favorite food is pasta , specifically bucatini all'amatriciana , which i discovered when i was performing in @entity240			0
and i love having a glass of wine after a show .			0
