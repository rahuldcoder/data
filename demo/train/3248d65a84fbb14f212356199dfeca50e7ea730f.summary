-- despite deep concerns about the economic impact of the looming fiscal cliff and months of talks leading up to this point , @entity1 and @entity2 are leaving town until after the november elections without making any significant progress resolving their main sticking points			1
meanwhile , economists warn that left unresolved , the fiscal situation could push the country back into a recession			1
lawmakers have said for months that no decisions on taxes , spending and entitlement reform can be made until after voters do their job on @entity25 and decide who will control the levers of power at the @entity29 and on @entity30			0
" elections matter , " said one top @entity32 aide involved in bipartisan efforts to come up with various contingency plans depending on the outcome of the presidential and congressional elections			0
fiscal cliff spending cuts : how @entity40 would be hit the enormity and complexity of the fiscal cliff -- which would happen at the end of the year when the @entity48 tax cuts expire , trillion dollars in automatic spending cuts are triggered and a handful of other thorny tax and spending issues need to be addressed -- are worsened by the partisan gridlock that led to it in the first place			1
most of the policy choices are well known to the lawmakers who were involved in the @entity59 deficit reduction commission , the so - called " @entity60 " talks , the bipartisan super committee negotiations and other recent failed attempts to reach a grand bargain to reduce the debt			0
the real question is whether policymakers can return after the election and find a common path forward			0
if former @entity74 gov. @entity73 wins the @entity29 it is likely @entity75 will agree to avoid the fiscal cliff by extending current policies for several months to give the new president time to put his stamp on the outcome , several lawmakers and aides said			1
but if president @entity82 wins and the makeup of @entity75 remains close to what it is now , negotiators could try to make headway during the post-election lame duck session			1
whether they can cut a deal during the few weeks after the election and before the end of the year is uncertain			1
fiscal cliff threatens small businesses " i have n't seen any real successes in a lame duck in a long time , so i do n't expect any this time , " said sen. @entity92 of @entity93 , the top @entity2 on the @entity94			1
" there 's a lot of polarization as we speak			0
" one of several moderate senators retiring at the end of this term said he did n't think a deal could be reached , either			2
" i 'm not optimistic that will happen because this is a kick - the - can - down - the - road @entity75 , " said sen. @entity106 , @entity107			2
" the best you 're going to get is to kick it down the road one more time			0
" sen. @entity113 , @entity114 , the chairman of the @entity115 and a leader of the @entity60 , is pushing a plan that would have @entity75 agree in a lame duck session to " hundreds of billions of dollars " in spending cuts and new taxes as a " down payment " on the work congressional committees would do next year to lower the deficit by $ 4 trillion over the next 10 years			1
he said @entity2 members of the @entity60 support his proposal			0
other senators have raised the idea of a down payment that would buy time for @entity75 to consider an overhaul of the tax code and replace the automatic spending cuts with more targeted cuts			2
" i think there will be a @entity141 solution to get us into the new @entity75 , " said sen. @entity134 , @entity136 - @entity135 , who is fighting defense cuts required by sequestration			2
" i 'm not a big fan of a lame duck @entity75 structurally reforming the entire nation			1
" @entity146 ' not confident at all ' on budget deal sen. @entity148 , @entity149 , said he 's never seen a lame duck session " that 's had any degree of success " and said the only thing that could change that is " if the markets start to react			1
" on that point , some @entity1 aides have begun to argue that while the situation is very serious , people should n't panic immediately about the january deadline because the fiscal cliff may be more of a slope that will gradually take effect as expiring tax cuts are felt in paychecks and cuts to federal programs take hold			1
they argue it is not comparable to the financial crisis of 2008 that led to sharp drops on @entity172 and a controversial federal bailout of many banks			0
in the meantime , members of the @entity176 this week met with top officials from the @entity179 , the @entity180 and @entity182 chairman @entity181 as they continued to lay the groundwork for lame duck negotiations			1
on the @entity29 side , @entity186 chairman @entity185 , @entity187 , met with treasury secretary @entity189 to do the same			0
at a news conference thursday two @entity32 @entity1 leaders offered up both optimism that a deal would prevent the fiscal cliff and pessimism that hardened ideologies will stand in the way			2
" i understand how we come together in times of crisis , " said senate majority leader @entity198 , @entity199			0
" i do not believe that we 're gon na go over the fiscal cliff			2
" but sen. @entity204 , @entity205 , who co-chaired the super committee , raised questions about whether @entity2 would ever agree to tax increases , something many @entity1 insist must be part of a final deal			0
" there is one solution to this and everyone knows it			0
we need to have both revenue and reductions on the page , and so far revenue has not been there because @entity2 have refused to , " she said			0
@entity73 : @entity82 passive in the face of ' fiscal cliff '			2

complexity of the fiscal cliff is worsened by partisan gridlock that led to it
whether @entity75 can cut a deal after the election and before the end of the year is uncertain
