the man she passes , newspaper editor @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , ca n't help falling in love with such a figure of feminine elegance			0
set in the 1960s , the golden era of the cheongsam in @entity3 , @entity17 's hit movie , " in the @entity24 " ( 2000 ) , which won multiple best foreign movie awards , was a powerful showcase for how elegant and sexy the classic @entity23 dress can be			1
@entity17 has said 20 to 25 cheongsam alone were made for the character played by @entity7			2
" a @entity28 : @entity3 @entity37 , " now running at the @entity38 until march 3 , features 130 exhibits showcasing the history and evolution of the cheongsam , particularly the eras featured in popular films such as " @entity35 " and " @entity36 " ( 1960 )			1
early cheongsam a feminist statement the exhibition is a study in the history surrounding the iconic @entity23 dress that can be confusing even to @entity23 -- the proper use of " cheongsam " and " qipao , " for instance			1
" we prefer to call it cheongsam -- not qipao , " says @entity48 , assistant curator of the exhibition			1
" @entity54 means long robe in @entity56 and actually only became a common woman 's wear after the @entity59 ( 1919 ) , or the @entity60 , " he says			1
" women started wearing men 's long robes as a feminist statement and trend during that @entity67 era			1
" therefore , it 's a bit of an oxymoron to continue calling the dress qipao , which refers to the robe of the @entity73 ( the ruling power of @entity75 )			1
" early cheongsam did n't have the tight , figure - hugging shape the dress is known for today , but was originally worn loose on the body			1
the shape changed and became tighter in @entity80 in the 1920s and ' 30s , a time often referred to as the golden age of the cheongsam in @entity80			2
with the rise of the @entity87 in the late 1940s and ' 50s , however , the dress , and the decadent @entity80 style it invoked , was restricted			2
@entity80 tailors fled to @entity3 , bringing the cheongsam with them			1

@entity12 represents the old guard -- tailors who recognize the beauty of a boar - shaped cut or a sword - shaped binding on a side slit			0
his wife , @entity107 , dissects a cheongsam the way a sommelier talks about wine			2
" the beauty of a cheongsam is not in the fabric -- fabrics can be purchased , but not the skills , " says @entity112			0
@entity12 started apprenticing under a @entity80 tailor when he was 16			0
he opened @entity94 seven years later			0
" i spent the first few months only learning to hold a needle properly , " says @entity12			0
" one can only start making a cheongsam after a year of apprenticeship			0
" " in the ' 60s , every woman wore a cheongsam , " says @entity12			0
as western culture and fashion became more influential among @entity23 in @entity3 in the 1970s , the cheongsam lost its popularity			1
will the cheongsam survive ? the craft is diminishing			0
all of @entity12 's in - house tailors are in their sixties			0
many have reduced their workloads			0
despite often being referred to as a sunset industry , however , @entity12 says he does n't worry that cheongsam culture wo n't last for another century			1
in @entity3 and @entity23 , the cheongsam is still popular for evening parties and company conferences			1

although global sales are difficult to track , several @entity23 makers advertise shops with a capacity for thousands of garments sewn monthly by staffs of 250 or more garment makers			1
brands like @entity162 and @entity163 , which carry cheongsam priced at about $ 400 , are making their marks with modern twists on the cheongsam			0

the business is expanding both in @entity23 and around the world , according to @entity174 , executive chairman of @entity162			1
the main elements of the dress 's original silhouette -- high collar and flower buttons on the placket -- make it easy to incorporate into new designs , says @entity48			2
inspiration still crosses over to @entity185 runways cheongsam designs have been included in a 2011 @entity188 collection , a 2012 @entity190 collection and @entity192 's 2013 spring / summer collection			2
unlike kimono or hanbok though modern , hybrid versions of the cheongsam are popular , there remains an appetite for the more traditional shapes			0
" classes teaching how to make cheongsam are offered in @entity3 , " says @entity48 , adding that the continuity of passing down the skills for cheongsam - making should n't be reserved for great tailors			1

" it 's different from ethnic costumes like the kimono and hanbok , as cheongsam has a highly flexible design , " says @entity48			2
" elements like dress length , different materials and different levels of complexity make dresses suitable for a variety of occasions			0
" " as one @entity23 saying goes , ' cheongsam is practical enough for the kitchen but presentable for the living room , ' " says @entity48			1
" the reason it 's been able to last for a century is because cheongsam is really beautiful on its wearer			2
" ordering a cheongsam at @entity3 cheongsam shops , customers first choose a style off the rack before deciding on details such as fabric , flower buttons on the placket , sleeve length and slit depth			1
