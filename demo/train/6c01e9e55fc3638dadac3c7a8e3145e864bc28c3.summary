-- he 's still missing			1
the seemingly never - ending search for the remains of missing @entity5 boss @entity4 hit another dead end tuesday when soil results taken from the grounds of a home in @entity10 showed no evidence that human remains were buried on the property			1
two soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban @entity17 community of @entity18 last week after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after @entity4 disappeared in 1975			1
the samples were taken from beneath a storage shed and sent to a lab at @entity25 for tests to determine the presence of human remains			1
" the samples submitted for examination showed no signs of human decomposition , " a statement from @entity18 police chief @entity30 said tuesday			2
it is the latest act in the on - again , off - again search for @entity4 , whose disappearance 35 years ago captured the public imagination			1
@entity4 , then 62 , was last seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside the @entity17 - area @entity39 restaurant			2
he was there ostensibly to meet with reputed @entity42 street enforcer @entity41 and @entity45 crime family figure @entity43 , who was also a chief of a @entity46 local in @entity48			0
@entity41 died in 1982 ; @entity43 died in 1988 in prison			0
the tipster , a former gambler , once did business with a man tied to @entity41 , said @entity54 , author of " the @entity55			0
" @entity54 said he first spoke to the tipster in march and then sent him to police			0
vanished @entity4 still fascinates after almost 40 years @entity30 said the " timeline does n't really add up " because the tipster said he went to the house to repay a bookie -- who did n't live at that address until years after @entity4 disappeared			1
still , the man said he thought he saw what could have been a body taken into the shed			0
@entity54 said it seemed unlikely that anyone would have been buried at the site , in full view of the neighborhood			0
and if a body had been buried there , little would remain , he said			2
" this is kind of like an open wound that wo n't go away , " @entity30 said monday			0
" every couple of years this happens , and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it			0
" @entity4 was one of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway			1
he was forced out of the organized labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			0
president @entity88 pardoned him in 1971 on condition he not attempt to get back into the union movement before 1980			0
@entity4 believed @entity41 had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between @entity4 and @entity43 , but @entity4 was the only one who showed up for the meeting , according to the @entity94			2
@entity41 and @entity43 later told the @entity94 that no meeting had been scheduled			0
the @entity94 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity4 's efforts to regain power in the @entity46 and the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			1
@entity104 and the @entity94 have searched for @entity4 intermittently			2
in september 2001 , the @entity94 found dna that linked @entity4 to a car that agents suspected was used in his disappearance			1
in 2004 , authorities removed floorboards from a @entity17 home to look for traces of blood , as former @entity46 official @entity114 claimed in a biography that he had shot @entity4			1
two years later , the @entity94 razed a horse barn in @entity10 following what it called " a fairly credible lead			1
" urban lore long suggested that @entity4 was buried around the end zone at the former @entity121 in @entity48			2
@entity0 's @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
