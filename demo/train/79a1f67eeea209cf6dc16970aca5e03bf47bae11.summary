-- the shocking scenes that unfolded at @entity2 on friday have added another name to the list of respectable but otherwise unremarkable towns forever scarred by tragedy			2
communities like @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have found themselves on the front line of a deeply emotional debate about the right to bear arms -- something that is enshrined in @entity17 's constitution			1
while some view the death of 20 children as proof that radical gun control reform in the @entity17 is needed , others believe the solution to the problem of gun violence is not better regulations but more guns			1
the result is @entity17 often struggles to find a common voice that satisfies those who totally oppose guns and those who fundamentally believe in their right of self - defense			1
yet gun violence is not an exclusively @entity17 issue			1
from @entity39 to @entity40 , communities not too dissimilar to @entity10 have experienced the same unspeakable horrors			1
but in some cases , those massacres have been a catalyst for important changes in gun control laws			1
we look at some of those experiences and their effects			2
@entity51 despite relatively limited gun ownership and availability , @entity51 has experienced several mass shootings in the past 25 years			1
on august 19 , 1987 , 27 - year - old @entity55 went on a bloody rampage for several hours in the southern @entity58 town of @entity59 , @entity60 armed with a pistol , hand grenade and an automatic rifle			2
he murdered 16 people and wounded over a dozen others , before he shot himself after being tracked down in a college building in the town			2
in the wake of the @entity59 massacre , @entity51 introduced new legislation -- @entity71 -- making registration mandatory for owning shotguns and banning semi-automatic and pump - action weapons			2
nine years later , on march 13 , 1996 , 43 - year - old @entity76 burst into a school in the picturesque town of @entity79 in central @entity39 and embarked on a terrifying shooting spree that left 16 five and six - year - old children and their teacher dead			1
the former scoutmaster turned one of the four pistols he was carrying on himself			2
the following year , a new law -- firearms ( amendment ) ( no. 2 ) act 1997 -- was passed effectively banning the private ownership of all handguns in the @entity51			2
this followed a highly successful public campaign in the months after @entity79 that included a petition being handed to the government with almost 750,000 signatures , according to @entity51 media reports			1
@entity51 was shaken by another massacre in june 2010 when a lone gunman , named as @entity98 , killed 12 people and injured almost 30 others after a near four - hour shooting spree in rural @entity102 , northern @entity58			2
after a huge manhunt , the body of the 52 - year - old taxi driver was found alongside two powerful rifles , one equipped with a telescopic sight			2
he had taken his own life			0
police were investigating 30 crime scenes at one point			0
the tragedy again raised questions about the effectiveness of @entity51 's gun laws after it was revealed @entity98 was licensed to carry firearms			1
the licensing application process involves being vetted by police as well as the applicant 's doctor to assess their fitness to own a weapon			0
@entity124 @entity124 enjoys a strong tradition of hunting and has a high proportion of gun ownership , with 1.5 million firearms owned in a nation of more than five million people , according to government figures			1
gun control has also been more relaxed here			1
until recently anyone aged 15 and over was able to apply for a gun license if they offered a valid reason such as membership of a gun club			1
though gun crime is rare , the country has suffered two major incidents at schools in recent years			1
on november 7 , 2007 , a teenager opened fire with a handgun at his high school in the southern @entity124 town of @entity149 , killing eight people before fatally turning the gun on himself			1
police said all of 18 - year - old @entity155 's victims had multiple gunshot wounds , most to the upper body and head			0
some 69 shells and more than 320 unused bullets were found at the scene			0
@entity155 , who had no criminal record , obtained a license for the weapon the previous month and regularly practiced sharp - shooting as a hobby at a local range , police said			0
the authorities said @entity155 , who police later described as lonely and antisocial , had posted a series of videos on @entity171 featuring guns , with some hinting at the massacre at @entity174 itself			0
the following year , on september 23 , the country was numbed by news of another mass shooting			0
over the course of 90 minutes , 10 people were fatally shot as @entity180 , wearing a ski mask and black fatigues , rampaged through a campus at @entity185 's @entity184 in southwestern @entity124			0
the 22 - year - old later died in hospital from a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the head			0
chillingly , police revealed @entity191 had been questioned days before the shooting about a video posted on the internet showing him firing a gun , though no action was taken because he was licensed and had not broken the law			2
in the wake of the shootings , the @entity124 government moved to issue new guidelines on the use of firearms , particularly handguns and revolvers			0
new applicants for handgun licenses are now required to show they 've been active members of a gun club for one year and be vetted by their doctor and police			2
the minimum age for purchasing licenses of short barrel weapons has been raised to 20 -- 18 for hunting rifles			0
permits are now valid for a period of five years before being reviewed			0
@entity218 in one of his first acts as leader , prime minister @entity219 announced major reforms to @entity218 's gun control laws just 12 days after 35 people died at the hands of a lone gunman wielding a military - style semi-automatic rifle at a popular tourist spot in @entity40 on april 28 , 1996			1
in the wave of public revulsion against what became known as the @entity233 , the move for stricter gun controls was led by @entity219 , who had taken office just seven weeks earlier and who , in the first few hours after the tragedy , declared himself horrified " at this shocking and senseless act			1
" he took his anti-gun campaign around the country , at one stage addressing a hostile pro-gun rally wearing a bullet - proof vest			0
he also oversaw a successful gun " buy - back " scheme that took some 650,000 guns out of circulation			2
@entity218 's eight states and territories got behind legislation that addressed mass shootings : high calibre rifles and shotguns were banned , licensing was tightened and remaining firearms were registered to uniform national standards -- an accomplishment regarded by many in the country as @entity219 's enduring legacy			1
@entity218 has been compared to the @entity17 for its " frontier mentality			1
" but unlike the @entity17 , there is no constitutional right to bear arms , gun ownership is markedly lower and @entity17 - style gun culture has taken hold in only a few pockets of @entity218 society -- most notably among the crime gangs operating in the two biggest cities , @entity275 and @entity276			1
@entity277 july 22 , 2011 will live long in the memory of all @entity277 after the carnage that unfolded that day			0
after detonating a bomb outside the prime minister 's office in @entity283 , killing eight people , @entity280 took a ferry to @entity286 and embarked on a shooting spree that took the lives of another 69 people attending a youth camp			0
authorities said @entity280 roamed the island shooting at campers , before members of an elite @entity277 police unit took him into custody			0
in august this year , @entity280 , who boasted of being an ultranationalist who killed his victims to fight multiculturalism in @entity277 , was judged to be sane at the time and sentenced to 21 years in prison after being charged with voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror			0
an independent report into the worst atrocity on @entity277 soil since @entity308 blamed a series of intelligence and planning failures for delaying the police arrival on the island by 30 minutes			0
despite ownership and the type of ammunition permitted for use being tightly regulated , the report also criticized @entity277 's gun controls as " inadequate			1
" it called for a total ban on semi-automatic weapons of the type @entity280 purchased with relative ease			0
like @entity124 , @entity277 has a high number of guns in circulation with hunting a national pastime			0
according to the @entity327 2007 : @entity331 and the @entity332 , " there are almost 32 firearms per 100 people in @entity277			0
this compares to 88.82 per 100 in the @entity17			1
@entity0 's @entity334 and journalist @entity335 contributed to this report .			0
