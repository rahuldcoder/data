-- if you can believe it , it 's been 25 years since @entity4 portrayed real - life math teacher @entity5 in " @entity6			1
" @entity5 , a @entity7 immigrant , taught in a tough @entity9 high school and pushed his lowest - achieving students to learn calculus			2
the inspirational role won @entity4 a @entity13 and garnered him an @entity15 nomination for best actor , a first for an @entity18 - born @entity17			1
since then , he 's played memorable roles , such as lt. @entity20 in " @entity21 , " @entity22 in the film " @entity24 " and @entity25 in " @entity26			1
" now , in his newest role as executive producer and actor in " @entity30 , " he plays lawyer named @entity32 who tries to help @entity34 - @entity18 hip - hop artist @entity33 , aka @entity30 , and her family get her mom out of jail			1
the late @entity39 plays the part of @entity43 's mother @entity41 a and @entity44 plays the father who takes care of @entity43 and her younger sister			2
@entity4 took some time to talk to @entity0 about the genuine portrayal of @entity5 , what @entity49 can do to make it in @entity52 and why @entity30 's story needs to be told			1
it 's been 25 years since " @entity6 " premiered in theaters			1
did you ever imagine that the movie would be so successful and influential as it 's been ? i do n't think anyone could 've predicted that			1
teachers use ( it ) as part of their curriculum			0
millions of kids see it every year			0
that 's why the movie is so well seen			1
it 's amazing what that movie has done with the youth			1
i do n't think anyone could have guessed that it would be used the way it 's being used			1
it continues to be inspirational			0
you 're very well - known for choosing your roles carefully			2
how genuine was your portrayal of @entity5 ? everything i did was him			0
i just copied him as much as i possibly could			0
all his mannerisms , the way he moved , the way he walked , the way he touched his hair			0
i saw him do all these things and then just did it all			2
he worked with me to get the character just right and his memory was always right on			0
we wrote the script together from day one			0
what advice do you have for other @entity49 trying to make it in @entity52 ? just do n't give up			2
the only people i know who do n't make it are the ones that quit			2
they must be continually educating themselves in the art form			0
every day , seven days a week for eight consecutive years , i was on stage : singing , talking , acting and performing			2
it 's like playing a piano			2
have you heard of a musician that 's really successful not playing their instrument everyday ? never , never			2
if i can brush my teeth everyday , i can do something i love everyday , even when i do n't feel like doing it			1
that 's really the key to success in this industry and in anything you do			1
do the things you love to do when you do n't feel like doing them			1
@entity52 has been known to hesitate to use @entity17 people to tell these @entity17 stories			1
why do you think that is ? i do n't think that they feel like there is a need a for it			1
the industry does n't have anything against @entity49			1
if they are feeding them @entity18 food like hamburgers , and they 're eating it by the billions , why do they have to feed them @entity34 food ? they do n't because they like it			2
why should @entity52 back actors who can not bring in the money ? that 's going to take time			2
can you tell me a bit about your role in " @entity30 ? " i play an attorney who tries to help @entity30 get her mother out of prison			1
i 've never played an attorney before			0
and , i 'm also the executive producer for the film			2
the film is a co-directed by @entity156 and @entity157			0
how was it working with your son ? it was great			0
it 's always fun to work with your family			0
i 'm very grateful for it			0
my other son , @entity165 , helped produce it			0
it 's been a family affair			0
why do you think it 's so important to tell the story of " @entity30 ? " it 's a story that 's never been told before in the history of film			1
that 's a good reason to do anything			0
there 's never been a movie of a @entity17 hip - hop artist who raps her poetry as well as her songs			1
what was it like to work with @entity39 , as this was the first time she took on an acting role ? that was probably the most inspirational part of the filming process			0
she ended up becoming the most inspirational artist on the set			0
@entity192 ( who plays @entity43 ) and her were just amazing			0
they just really committed , and their technique was so strong			0
their ability to create the reality was just profound			0
those that have seen it are left stunned			0
you will see if you have n't already , it 's the best final scene in a movie that i 've seen in years			1
what do you want the audience , latinos as well as @entity208 , to take away with them after watching their film ? you ca n't go through this life alone			1
you do n't reach the clarity that you do in life unless you work with your family			1
and , if the @entity15 has an opportunity to see this film , they will get to see truly riveting performances in a very modest film			0
" @entity30 " opens in theaters on friday , april 19th .			1
