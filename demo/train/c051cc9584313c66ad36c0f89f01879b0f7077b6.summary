-- the first week his debut album , " @entity3 , " came out , @entity1 found himself nestled in the @entity5 's @entity4 between the likes of @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
the late april release landed at no. 6 , an impressive showing for a guy who 's released two singles so far			1
but one of those singles -- a joyous country - rock tune called " @entity23 , " an ode to rule breakin ' with a girl on the tailgate of a truck bed -- has done remarkably well since its release in september			1
it 's been certified gold and has sold more than 700,000 digital singles , with the video viewed nearly 7 million times on @entity30			1
for @entity1 fans , the appetite for more music has been growing steadily for about seven months			1
and it could n't come at a better time for the @entity37 native , who 's been primarily making his living in @entity39 over the last four years as a songwriter with a publishing deal as well as a touring musician , playing bars and small clubs across the country			1
" i 've been writing about two songs a day for about seven or eight years , " the 32 - year - old singer told @entity0 from a tour stop in @entity48 last month			2
" ( when i moved to ) @entity39 , it was a move because that 's what i really wanted to do			2
i think it 's natural when you get to a town like that , you question , ' are you good enough ? ' every single day			2
" i was below the bar i needed to be when i first got there			2
i questioned going home all the time my first few years			0
you see your friends around you building a foundation with their jobs , retirement , family -- not that those things are what i want now , but you could look up , and you 're 40 years old -- all of a sudden you have nothing to show for it			0
" before moving to @entity39 in the early 2000s with songwriting aspirations , @entity1 credits the time he spent in @entity72 after college for helping him get his songwriting skills up to snuff			1
he 'd grown up on artists such as @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
as a kid , he fondly recalls his father playing their music often in the car on the way to go fishing on the @entity87 , but he did n't really know what he wanted to do with his life until he hit the big island			0
" i lived in a little hut with a backpack and went to the beach every day , " @entity1 recalled			1
" i wrote a lot of songs out there			0
' everything but you ' is strictly from that experience			0
i did n't know what i wanted to do with my life			0
i 've always been a little bit like that			0
i worked a bunch of odd jobs , but i realized out there that with my personality , unless i was doing music , there was no way i was going to be happy			0
" it 's been noted that @entity1 has that blue - collar @entity113 thing going on , and you can certainly hear that scruff in his voice at times , along with a healthy dose of rock ' n ' roll fused within all of his songs			1
but on " @entity3 , " @entity1 does n't sing about the plight of the working class ; instead , he 's much more apt to detail life after the whistle blows and the paycheck 's been cashed			1
the joys of ice cold beer , sunshine , a favorite girl in a favorite sundress -- he spins all of these notions into simple stories that sound blissful , with a little bit of a devilish streak to them			0
" sometimes a songwriter can get in the way of things , " he said			0
" i try to just speak it like how i felt people would say it			1
how i would say it			0
i feel like people are relating to how i say it , and people are moved by some of those songs			2
" @entity1 's slated to spend most of the summer on the road , playing a mixture of club dates and state fairs , and he 's finally ready to admit that he might just make it as a musician			1
" recently , we 've been selling out these clubs and see how rabid these people are for the music , " he said			2
" they knew all these tracks before they 'd been released			0
i 've felt this wave in the past two weeks , where i 've thought things might be all right			2

@entity1 's debut album , " @entity3 , " landed in @entity5 's @entity4
" @entity23 " has been certified gold and has sold more than 700,000 digital singles
" i try to just speak it like how i felt people would say it , " @entity1 says
