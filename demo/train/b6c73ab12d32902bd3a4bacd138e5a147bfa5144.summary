@entity1 almost immediately following the news of the first terrorist attacks that eventually killed 17 people across @entity6 , the global community united around a @entity8 hashtag " @entity9 " and just days later foreign leaders linked arms with their @entity6 counterparts to lead a historic million - person strong rally			1
meanwhile , explosives strapped to a girl who appeared to be about 10 - years - old detonated on saturday , killing at least 20 people , in a country whose encounters with terrorism were also punctuated by a hashtag -- this time " # @entity22 " of @entity23			1
@entity25 militants killed as many as 2,000 people , mostly civilians , in a massacre that started the weekend before the terror attack on @entity29 in downtown @entity30			1
both the attacks in @entity23 and those in @entity30 are shocking and horrifying in their own respects , and yet one fomented an unprecedented international reaction -- a popular show of force that rivaled even the reaction to 9/11 -- while the response to the attacks in @entity23 paled in comparison			1
here are a few of the reasons why : symbolism the terrorist attack on the satirical publication @entity46 was not just violent , but highly symbolic			0
while the terrorists in @entity23 targeted innocent civilians in a strategic northern town in @entity23 and in a crowded marketplace , the gunmen who stormed the headquarters of @entity46 took aim at one of the most cherished values in @entity6 : freedom of expression			1
the attack quickly sparked the hashtag and image on social media proclaiming " @entity61 , " i am @entity9			2
in a way that few nations would , the @entity6 people took the attack on @entity46 as an attack on the very core of their country 's constitution and values -- a country where the line between politics and culture blends often seamlessly and where criticism and mockery of public officials rushes toward -- not away -- from controversy			1
it 's a special relationship to a freedom won over and fought for more than once through bloody revolution that even president @entity83 recognized as he reacted to the @entity46 shootings			0
" no country knows better than @entity6 , that freedom has a price because @entity6 gave birth to democracy itself , " he said			2
and @entity92 can directly relate to attacks on freedom of speech , former @entity92 ambassador to @entity23 @entity95 said			1
and beyond the @entity6 people 's broad reverence for freedom of speech , @entity6 is a country heavy on symbolism , embodied by its national motto of " @entity102 , " @entity102			1
that symbolism , which drove millions into the streets of @entity30 , cities around @entity6 and around the world , was also quickly seized on by @entity6 's president @entity107 , who quickly called for national unity in an address that honed in on @entity6 's ardent belief in freedom			1
and while the reaction to the attacks in @entity30 evolved naturally through social media , @entity107 and his government successfully picked up on the public sentiment and amplified those voices			1
@entity23 president @entity118 , though , had concerns more pressing than issuing a rallying cry of defiance in the face of attacks that again sought to undermine his country 's very sovereignty			1
in fact , while @entity118 issued a statement condemning the attack on @entity46 and expressing @entity23 's " full solidarity " with the people of @entity6 , he failed to do the same for the victims of terrorism in his own country			1
@entity118 is up for reelection next month and the atrocities committed by @entity25 are the last thing he wants to address			0
and the attacks in @entity23 have barely resonated within the country 's borders , said @entity95 former @entity92 ambassador to @entity23			1
" it has n't even had a very large impact in @entity144 , " @entity95 said of @entity23 's most populous city			1
by contrast , the attacks on freedom of speech resounded strongly not just in @entity6 , but around the world			1
" @entity92 can directly relate to attacks on freedom of speech			0
they can directly relate to terrorism and the impact in @entity6 is being compared to the impact of 9/11 in the @entity92 , " @entity95 said			1
" @entity25 by contrast is viewed as a kind of civil war ... and it 's all happening a very long way away			0
" @entity107 , however , came face to face with an opportunity -- an opportunity to boost his own sagging political fortunes and to help unify a society increasingly fractured by politics			0
a country aching for long - lost national unity the attacks also gave @entity6 a shot in the arm , reinvigorating a long - lost sentiment of national unity not seen since at least the last @entity171			1
@entity107 has faced the lowest popularity of any president in @entity6 history , with just 13 % approving of his leadership at the end of 2014			2
driving @entity107 's sinking numbers , an economy struggling to reboot has also fueled the historic rise of @entity6 's far right party , the @entity181			1
and after waves of immigration , the @entity181 and its xenophobic , protectionist platform are thriving on the perception that immigration is changing the color and meaning of the @entity6 nationality and challenging the very core of @entity6 's identity			1
but the reaction to the attacks has given the @entity181 and @entity194 a slap in the face like only @entity46 -- which regularly lampooned the party and its leader -- could			2
@entity199 decided not to attend the march after she was not expressly invited , though the event was open to any participants			0
instead , the demonstrators in @entity30 proclaimed a national unity cut in stark contrast to the divisive rhetoric of the @entity181			2
@entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , immigrants and those with deep roots in @entity6 joined together to proclaim " @entity61			0
" but that 's not all they proclaimed			0
@entity209 joined others in carrying signs saying " @entity218 , " i am @entity210 , a powerful statement that countered not only the third gunmen @entity222 's targeting of @entity210 but also increasingly concerning reports of rising anti-semitism in @entity6 that are spurring thousands of @entity6 @entity210 to emigrate to @entity226			2
and all joined in singing " @entity227 , " the powerful rallying cry that is the @entity6 national anthem			0
common fears as much as the terrorist attacks failed in their objective of silencing criticism of their @entity236 ambitions , the attacks brought concerns over homegrown terrorists and foreign fighters to the surface -- not just in @entity241 , but in the @entity92			0
the three gunmen who locked down @entity30 for days were not only @entity6 citizens , but two claimed to be affiliated with @entity244 while @entity222 pledged allegiance to @entity246 , the @entity236 group which has ravaged parts of @entity248 and @entity249 and inspired militants around the world			1
the attacks have prompted @entity92 intelligence officials to scrutinize their terror databases and reassess potential threats , and @entity257 press secretary @entity256 discussed the risk countries like the @entity92 and @entity6 face in taking the fight to @entity246			1
but the attacks by @entity25 in @entity23 do n't stoke the same fears in the @entity262 , former @entity264 chairman @entity263 said			2
" a lot look at @entity25 and associate them more as a separatist group than an @entity269 minded group			0
i think that 's wrong , " said @entity263 , who is now a @entity2 national security commentator			0
" if you have a group that is this brutal and shows this much disregard for human life and it 's growing and it 's trying to recruit people to its cause , this is a huge problem			0
" opinion : @entity25 massacre : 7 questions worth asking @entity269 in the @entity282 ( @entity283 ) was at one time the largest funder of @entity25 , @entity263 said , and @entity283 has largely influenced the @entity23 group 's tactics			2
while @entity25 does n't present as much of a threat to the @entity92 as @entity246 , @entity263 believes @entity92 officials should be more concerned about @entity25 , particularly as the economies in @entity291 countries are booming and much of the continent is looking for trade relationships beyond the continent			0
without a sense of urgency or a direct threat , the @entity92 and @entity241 public are unlikely to react to attacks in @entity23 in the same way as they react to attacks in @entity30			1
and besides @entity92 have grown numb to the level of violence throughout the @entity291 continent , said @entity306 , director of the @entity307 at the @entity308			0
@entity25 alone killed an estimated 10,000 people in 2014			0
" there 's a sense that ' that 's @entity307 , bad things happen			0
this is @entity30 , it 's a @entity314 country			2
this should n't happen , ' " @entity306 explained			0
" we 're conditioned by years of reports coming out of @entity307 to expect this type of thing in @entity307			0
" optics and a 24/7 media people around the world watched for days as the manhunt and later tense standoff unfolded between @entity6 security forces and the terrorists			2
in @entity6 , around @entity241 and in the @entity92 , people connected on social media and reacted in real time as they watched each development unfold on cable news or through dramatic videos posted to @entity334			2
and that coverage dominated the news cycle , with little if any information popping up on tv about an ongoing massacre in northern @entity23 that would in the end claim 2,000 lives			0
instead , most found out late this weekend or on monday morning about the attack in @entity23 that started on jan. 3			0
there are not only fewer reporters and news cameras in @entity23 than in @entity30 , but access to the northern region of @entity23 where the attacks unfolded is dangerous and practically inaccessible			1
" there are n't visuals of @entity353 and what happened there , " @entity306 said of the town ravaged by @entity25 's militants			0
in @entity30 , everything is happening " in real time , " he added .			0

@entity6 and @entity23 experienced waves of terrorism during the first weeks of 2015
while the terror attacks in @entity30 sparked international unified outrage , reaction to @entity23 was more muted
symbolism , politics and media all played a role in how @entity6 's response to terrorism was *perceived*
