a pharmacy graduate from @entity2 who sympathized with @entity3 , and traveled to @entity4 in the hopes of linking up with the terrorist group , was sentenced thursday to 17Â½ years in federal prison , court officials said			1
@entity8 , 29 , was found guilty in december of conspiring to help @entity3 , conspiring to commit murder in a foreign country and making false statements			1
" this is one of the most significant terror - related cases ever brought , " said @entity13 law professor @entity12			0
" prosecutions like this push the envelope in terms of how far the government can go after an individual 's conduct prior to committing any terrorist act			0
" the government was a big winner today			0
" @entity8 traveled to @entity4 in 2004 to receive training to kill @entity27 soldiers and support terrorism at home			1
but he never found a training camp , and it remains unclear if he ever made contact with a terrorist group			1
after returning to the @entity27 , @entity8 posted @entity3 recruitment videos and documents on the @entity35 , and was convicted of providing material support to terrorists though it 's again not clear if he ever actually made contact with the group			1
prosecutors say @entity8 had been in touch with a man named @entity43 , who headed to the @entity44 to receive jihadist training			1
@entity43 pleaded guilty in 2007 to traveling to @entity46 to fight in a " jihad " against the transitional government there			0
" you might call ( @entity8 ) a terrorist wannabe , " said @entity12 , who noted that thursday 's sentencing reflected an apparent compromise			2
" i think the judge wanted to be cautious and distinguish this kind of conduct from the more fundamental ( and traditional descriptions of ) terrorist acts , " @entity12 said			0
federal prosecutors had asked for 25 years , and @entity8 could have faced life in prison			2
the case has been a focus of legal experts , who debated the extent of free speech protection and how and when authorities can move against someone believed to be engaged pre-terror - related activity			1
@entity8 's lawyers had argued that in collecting and distributing jihadist propaganda upon his return to the @entity27 , he was exercising his first amendment rights			1
some of the material he translated , they say , involved mujahedeen fighting the @entity77 occupation of @entity78 more than two decades ago			0
but prosecutors instead argued that law enforcement has the responsibility to both head off and deter potential terrorist threats			0
" there is a greater value in using this case to achieve the ends of general deterrence than in terrorism cases involving isolated or short - lived activities , " they said in a statement			0
" that is because @entity8 's actions are the kind that most individuals who are radicalized in @entity27 are likely to contemplate replicating -- traveling overseas to get terrorism experience , and using the @entity35 to connect with and support other terrorists			2
" @entity8 's supporters , meanwhile , have pledged their backing online , setting up a website in his defense			2
@entity27 district judge @entity103 also handed @entity8 seven years of supervised release as a part of the closely watched decision thursday			2
hailing from a @entity108 suburb , @entity8 earned a doctorate at the @entity110 , where his father worked as a professor .			0

@entity8 , 29 , was found guilty of conspiring to help @entity3 , other charges
he sought training in @entity4 , but it 's not clear if he ever made contact with a terror group
