editor 's note : " @entity2 " is on @entity3 nightly at 7 and 9 et. @entity2 says to always question conventional wisdom			1
@entity5 ( @entity6 ) -- " the people who survived the @entity8 were the ones who had money to buy when everybody else was selling			2
" -- my grandfather i learned a lot from my grandfather , but that might have been the greatest lesson he ever taught me			2
he was n't just talking about managing money , he was talking about managing life -- and his words have stuck with me since i was a child			2
a few years back , i was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with			2
i read those books , but i also asked that professor which books he thought had it completely wrong -- and i read those too			2
then i made up my own mind			2
after all , following the herd is fine until they all run off the side of a cliff together			2
less than a year ago , a recession was the last thing on anyone 's mind			1
in fact , over the summer , as i was questioning the conventional wisdom , i read an article on my television show that quoted a financial expert as saying , " it is the strongest global market that we 've seen in the history of measuring these things			2
" that 's when i realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff			1
but with predictions of a recession now more common than @entity55 rate cuts -- and that 's saying something -- maybe now it 's time to look at a worst - case scenario			1
after all , considering all sides of an issue , no matter how extreme they may be , does n't make you a crazy person ; it makes you an educated one			2
so to understand what a real meltdown could look like , i turned to @entity67 , chairman of @entity68 and professor of economics at @entity72 's @entity71			1
he 's also a former adviser to the @entity73			1
professor @entity67 recently laid out what he called the " 12 steps to financial disaster			2
" unfortunately , they were really complicated , and i have severe @entity78 , so i 've boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand			0
i think of these like our military 's " @entity82 " -- or defense readiness condition -- scale , except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account : @entity91 how you 'll know we 're here : the housing downturn turns into a free fall , making it the worst collapse in our country 's history			1
that not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth , but it also sets off another large wave of bank write - downs			1
odds we get here : @entity67 told me that it 's " extremely likely , even unavoidable " that we hit this stage because " the excess supply of new homes in the market is like we 've never seen before			1
" prices , he believes , " need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears			0
" @entity115 how you 'll know we 're here : @entity119 upside - down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt , like credit cards , car loans and student loans			1
in addition , bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings , forcing already troubled banks to write down another $ 150 billion			0
odds we get here : high			0
@entity67 says that 8 million households are already upside - down on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million and 24 million by the end of 2009			1
a lot of those people , he believes , will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank			0
@entity91 three how you 'll know we 're here : some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing write - downs and mounting defaults by consumers			1
a national or large regional bank finally collapses , triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on @entity151 , potentially leading to a 1987 - style market crash			1
odds we get here : very good			0
@entity67 says that we 'll likely socialize the losses , " effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks			0
" it would be , he told me , " like @entity160 ( the large bank in @entity162 that was recently taken over by the @entity164 government ) times three			0
" he thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed			0
@entity168 how you 'll know we 're here : most forms of credit ( both to consumers and businesses ) become virtually nonexistent			0
that results in a " vicious circle " of additional write - downs , stock market losses , and bank collapses , which leads to even less credit being available			1
odds we get here : good			0
@entity67 says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and wo n't be getting better anytime soon			0
without extra credit available , people might have to actually ( gasp ! ) live within their means			0
@entity91 how you 'll know we 're here : welcome back to 1929			1
a full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system			0
what will be known to future generations as " @entity198 " has arrived			0
odds we get here : not likely			0
@entity67 believes that this will be a " very painful and severe recession " that could last for 18 months or more , but it will be more like 1981 than 1929			0
families may be eating soup again , but at least it 'll be in their own kitchens			0
now , do i think any of what you just read will happen ? i have no idea , and that 's exactly the problem			1
i 'm not an economist or a stockbroker ; i 'm just a guy trying to make the best decisions i can , and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that			0
but i do know one thing for sure : depressions are n't advertised in advance			0
last time around we went from the @entity225 ' 20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years			1
anyone who says that ca n't happen again either does n't know history , does n't understand how interconnected the world 's economies have become , or is lying to you			1
while that does n't mean you should panic , it does mean you should prepare -- something my grandfather would 've done a long time ago			1

@entity2 lays out the @entity91 scale
@entity2 *ponders* : will the economy collapse into " @entity244 " ?
" maybe now it 's time to look at a worst - case scenario , " he says
then again , maybe not : be prepared is the key
