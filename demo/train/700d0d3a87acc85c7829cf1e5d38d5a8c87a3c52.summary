-- @entity1 is a bit of curio			0
on the surface it 's as modern as any city could hope to be , addicted as it is to technology and modern design			1
let me entertain you , @entity12 - style			1
bars and karaoke rooms abound in entertainment areas			0
yet among the blocky skyscrapers and highways running through the sprawling city like monuments to the country 's rapid industrialization , are vestiges of the 600 - year - old capital			1
mountains , parks and 16th century palaces are in stark contrast to the neon and noise of the city 's shopping and entertainment areas			1
duck off one of the main boulevards like @entity34 in the center of the city and you can discover one of pulsating areas where @entity40 relax -- often in city 's thousands of restaurants , bars and noraebang ( karaoke bars ) that should feature in even a flying visit			1
home to over 10 million people , the best policy is to make the most of just a few of the city 's districts			1
start near @entity53 in @entity54 , a downtown area close to some of the city 's best sites and shopping ( located on and around @entity59 ) and all within a walkable distance			1
steps away from @entity53 subway station is one of the city 's @entity65 dynasty palaces , @entity63 , where you can sample a quieter side of @entity1			1
it 's the site of one of @entity73 's @entity72 's residences ; he turned the old aristocratic house into a palace in 1593			2
if you 're in the city on sunday , a reenactment of the changing of the guards takes place outside the main gate ; false beards are moustaches are attached as the brightly colored guards go through the motions			2
a few minutes from the palace is the decent @entity86 on @entity87 , where international and @entity12 artists get a regular showing			1
the tranquility of the palace grounds are a great contrast to much of the rest of the city -- not far away original parts of old @entity1 's city walls can still be seen in mountains to the north			1
for a closer inspection of @entity1 of old , history buffs can get their fill at the @entity102 , twenty minutes walk from @entity63			0
@entity103 is to push on another 20 minutes from the museum and you 'll hit @entity106 , the largest and grandest of the city 's palace grounds			1
to save pounding the concrete there hop in a taxi -- standard cabs are white , but for the sake of a bit more legroom , shinier leather seats , and twice the cost , black deluxe taxis are also cruising the streets			2
in true @entity1 tech style , many are equipped with a free digital translation service , useful as many drivers do n't speak much @entity124			0
the preserved village of @entity126 lies between @entity106 to the west and @entity128 to the east , where you can wander around restored timber houses and courtyards , and also grab a bite to eat in one of the area 's cafes or restaurants			2
the city and @entity73 in general has a fascination with technology and design and is constantly positioning itself on the cutting edge of both			2
the most recent addition to the city 's modern landscape is @entity149 architect @entity148 ' " transformer "			1
his shape - changing building can flip onto one of its three sides depending on its use and is currently home to a @entity155			2
it sits in a cozy juxtaposition next to the 16th century @entity159 pavilion			0
for a less ambiguous view of the city , hop in a taxi to @entity164 cable car station			2
it will propel you up to a peak in @entity164 -- central @entity1 's biggest -- next to the @entity168 , from where you can survey the sprawling metropolis			2
throw yourself back into the thick of it by hitting @entity173 market , also known as the goblin market			0
it 's a hive of goods from cheese to camcorders , often sold at cheaper prices than elsewhere			0
do n't expect just stalls , it 's more a mix of buildings , underground malls and shops			0
@entity187 department store is a city favorite in @entity54 , but those after a bit of @entity12 kitsch or quirk should be happy browsing around the boutiques off @entity194 and @entity195			1
more meccas to mammon can be found at @entity198 to the east			0
it 's been the site of a market since 1905 , but inevitably is now a block of towers stuffed with shopping malls			0
be careful , it could take a whole day to explore each one			0
crossing downtown @entity1 is the @entity209 stream -- a river that was covered by a road until it was unearthed in 2005 and transformed into one of the city center 's most popular urban oases and worth a stroll in the evening			1
just north of @entity209 is the slightly twee area of @entity217 , an area as close as @entity1 comes to its past in its present work - a - day guise			1
the area has as few tacky tourist shops , but gets enough local life to make it a good area to grab a bite to eat			0
the narrow winding streets off @entity228 are crammed with traditional style buildings housing restaurants where @entity12 barbeques , bibimbap , kimchi and other delights of @entity12 cuisine can be sampled and often quite reasonably priced			1
for a bit of local flavor on the go , street vendors serve up kimchi pancakes , octopus and other @entity12 snacks , while mobile restaurants appear on some of the street corners around @entity54 and @entity217 when night falls			1
duck under the temporary tarpaulin hoisted over these carts , take a seat next to a local and enjoy cultural feast as well as simple , fresh cooked local dishes			0
@entity252 , the local firewater , or some @entity12 beer is a typical accompaniment			2
it could get you in the mood for a bout of karaoke in a private room , or noraebang			0
in which case it could be worth asking your hotel concierge for a recommendation for an @entity124 - friendly one , or just dive in and indulge in the randomness of it all			0
@entity269 of downtown is @entity271 ; a decent area for bars and music , and its more salubrious that @entity274 , twenty minutes south in a taxi from downtown @entity1			0
here you 're more likely to see @entity277 military police in a club or bar than a local , which is another reminder that the other world that is @entity73 is only 30 miles away			0
if you have an extra few days , take a trip to the @entity283 ( @entity284 ) -- organized tours are the only way to see it .			0

among the urban sprawl are *pockets* of tranquility , neon - lit *fun* and *greenery*
the @entity65 dynasty palaces are a must , offering a contrast to the city 's concrete
@entity217 provides some old world charm and great places to eat @entity12 cuisine
