-- on the eve of president @entity4 's speech laying out his strategy to combat the terror group @entity6 , national security hawks are demanding the @entity7 authorize airstrikes against the group 's leaders			1
" we need to be targeting the top @entity6 military and strategic leadership , " said @entity11 at the @entity12			2
" our policy up ' til now has n't been good enough			1
it 's a day late and a dollar short , and that 's why @entity6 is a threat to the @entity7			1
" so far , @entity7 airstrikes have focused on @entity6 field positions in @entity23 , following three limited goals outlined by the president : to protect @entity7 , help @entity23 forces and prevent a humanitarian disaster			1
but top leaders have not been singled out , according to @entity30 spokesman col. @entity29			2
" we have not conducted any targeted airstrikes on specific @entity6 leaders , " he said , using the administration 's acronym for @entity6 , which calls itself the " @entity33 "			1
still , when asked why the @entity7 is not trying to kill the group 's top leaders , @entity38 spokesman @entity37 did not rule out such a strategy in the future			1
" i would anticipate that as our intelligence improves , and crystallizes , that our military capabilities will expand accordingly , " @entity37 said tuesday			0
moreover , he said , thanks to the formation of a new @entity23 government , the president believes " we are ready to enter the next , more offensive phase , in this strategy			0
" the president 's former national security adviser , retired gen. @entity51 , said he would be very surprised if the president did not instruct the military to target the head of @entity6 at some point			1
" when the president gives the word , it will be a formidable capability that we launch against this organization , and perhaps against him			0
" a brief history of fighting terror analysts said the first challenge would be to locate elusive @entity6 leaders like @entity64			1
" the trouble is , they do n't have good human intelligence networks in @entity73 right now , " said @entity65 , author of a new book about a mole who infiltrated @entity69			2
trying to penetrate a group as ruthless as @entity6 with a secret agent would not only be extraordinarily difficult , he said , but also highly dangerous			2
former @entity77 operative @entity76 said he believes @entity6 militants are shrewdly avoiding electronic intercepts			2
" i 'm quite certain that @entity6 is staying off the phone , and nobody around @entity83 , for instance , would have a cell phone , for instance , or any kind of communications , " he said			0
and the failure of the recent @entity7 attempt to rescue @entity7 hostages with a team of commandos , he said , showed that " our information is old , and secondhand			0
" 5 questions @entity4 must answer about @entity6 strategy but a @entity7 intelligence official pointed out that over time , the @entity7 has killed top extremist leaders , from @entity100 in @entity101 to @entity102 in @entity103 to @entity104 in @entity23			1
" the intelligence community has a proven track record finding , fixing and finishing elusive leaders of terrorist groups , " the official said			0
" it is a real cat and mouse game , and in this case the cat is an experienced hunter			0
" even if @entity64 were killed , another militant could easily take his place , in the same way that @entity118 himself rose to the top position after both his predecessors were killed			0
@entity4 to @entity122 : no vote needed on @entity6 strategy but @entity124 with the @entity125 , who studied dozens of past cases where extremist groups were decapitated , found that killing a group 's leaders can increase the odds of defeating it by 25 % to 30 %			1
" removing these individuals can help to degrade the organization in ways that make it harder for them to operate , " he said , by depriving the group of its leader 's charisma , operational skills , personal contacts and even fundraising			0
@entity0 's @entity142 and @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
