-- the @entity2 @entity1 on tuesday denied a stay of execution appeal from @entity5 , scheduled to be the first woman executed in the @entity2 in five years			1
@entity8 gov. @entity7 previously rejected a clemency request from the death row inmate , who is set to die by injection thursday evening			1
@entity12 , a 41 - year - old grandmother , pleaded guilty to her part in the 2002 slayings of her husband and stepson in their rural home near @entity19 , @entity8 , about 145 miles from @entity20			1
two male co-conspirators -- the triggermen -- were given life in prison without parole			1
@entity7 last week refused to issue a stay for @entity12 , who is the first woman scheduled to be executed in @entity8 in nearly a century			1
" having carefully reviewed the petition for clemency , the judicial opinions in this case , and other relevant materials , i find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was imposed by the @entity35 and affirmed by all reviewing courts , " the governor wrote			1
" accordingly , i decline to intervene and have notified the appropriate counsel and family of my decision			1
" @entity12 and her lawyers had formally asked the governor to spare her life , arguing she has an iq that is borderline mentally retarded and that she was manipulated to commit the crimes by a dominant male co-defendant			1
she pleaded guilty to her participation in the murders , but now regrets her actions			1
" i just want the governor to know that i am so sorry , deeply from my heart , " she recently told @entity0			1
" and if i could take it back , i would , in a minute ... i just wish i could take it back			1
and i 'm sorry for all the people that i 've hurt in the process			1
" @entity12 had admitted to police she concocted the plot to kill her husband , @entity12 , and his son , @entity59 , an @entity60 reservist set to be deployed to @entity61			2
at the time , she was having an affair with @entity63 and paid him and then - 19 - year - old @entity64 to commit murder for the victims ' insurance money			2
court records show @entity12 gave the two killers cash to buy weapons and left the door of the rural home open for easy entry			2
@entity5 was in bed with her husband when he was blasted with a shotgun by @entity63			1
@entity12 survived long enough to tell police : " my wife knows who did this to me			2
" @entity59 was killed by @entity64 in his bedroom down the hall			2
despite her guilty plea , a state judge later sentenced @entity12 to death while sparing the lives of @entity88 and @entity64			2
the judge at sentencing called her " the head of this serpent			2
" the state argued @entity12 was the mastermind of the murders - for - hire , and officials say she does not deserve mercy			1
" i can frankly say that @entity5 is as evil a person as i 've ever met , " said @entity98 , commonwealth 's attorney for @entity99 , who was at the scene of the crimes shortly after they occurred			1
" i would wager with some assurance that you would n't find anyone who knew her before this event occurred who thought she was mentally retarded , or had a limited mentality -- that it would ever cross their minds			2
" her supporters say @entity12 is deeply remorseful and has been a model prisoner , helping fellow female inmates cope with their circumstances			0
" i do feel i could be a lot of help to some of the women -- which i have already			0
from my understanding i 've already helped a lot , to change their lives , or made them look at their lives in a different way , " she told @entity0			0
@entity132 and best - selling author @entity133 are among those supporting leniency			0
@entity98 said @entity12 has a " fairly low " iq but noted courts have concluded she is not mentally retarded			0
the state also argued @entity12 waited 45 minutes after the shootings before calling police and that she had involved her then - 16 - year - old daughter in the plot			0
defense lawyer @entity146 argued that such evidence suggested " @entity5 could not have been the mastermind			1
" " @entity63 has stated , and the experts that have examined her agree , that she was being used by @entity63 , not the other way around , " he said			0
@entity12 ' attorneys say that @entity63 admitted he used @entity59 to get at the $ 250,000 she would receive in the event her stepson died			0
a letter from @entity63 to another woman , they say , said that the only reason he slept with @entity59 was " so she would give me the insurance money			0
" " she was exactly what i was looking for , " he wrote			0
" some ugly bitch who married her husband for the money and i knew i could get to fall head over heels for me			0
" furthermore , they said , @entity63 said he " manipulated the whole thing " and " knew he was going ' take ' @entity12 from the moment he met her , " according to an affidavit from one of their investigators			0
but @entity63 , who committed suicide in 2006 , refused to sign the affidavit and actually tore up and ate part of it			0
still , @entity98 said , his investigation showed that @entity12 took an active role in the plot , that she connived and manipulated everyone from her late husband to her lover to her children			0
from early on , he said , @entity12 schemed several different ways to get the inheritance money			0
she helped plan an earlier plot to kill her husband that failed			0

grandmother , 41 , scheduled to be executed thursday
