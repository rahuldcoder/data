@entity1 militants have told @entity2 in a northern @entity4 city that they will guarantee their safety			1
but there 's a catch			0
make that a lot of catches			0
@entity12 residents of @entity13 , once one of the nation 's most liberal cities , will have to pay as much as 17 grams of gold per adult male in an annual payment , the extremist group the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said in a statement posted online this week			1
the group is also forbidding the city 's christians from repairing or refurbishing their churches and monasteries , said the statement , which has been circulated in the city , according to @entity4 activists			1
the list of constraints imposed by the militants also limits @entity12 worship , business activities and alcohol consumption			0
the heavy restrictions are perhaps unsurprising coming from @entity10 , which has broken away from @entity35 and is fighting with other rebel groups in @entity4			1
activists told @entity38 in november that @entity13 was becoming increasingly conservative after @entity10 began imposing hardline @entity1 law there and meting out harsh punishment to those who do n't follow orders			2
locals started calling the city @entity46 and saying it felt as if the @entity48 of @entity49 had taken over			0
@entity10 's new set of restrictions on @entity2 has drawn criticism from the @entity4 opposition and even a radical @entity55 cleric			1
@entity56 , a spokesman for the @entity57 , said @entity10 's treatment of non-muslims was un-islamic			0
and the radical cleric , @entity60 , who is on trial in @entity62 over terrorism charges , told @entity64 on thursday that the militants did n't have the right to offer protection and demand payment from @entity2 because they were n't yet empowered to govern @entity4			0
it 's unclear how many @entity2 remain in @entity13 after years of bloody civil war in @entity4			1
since @entity10 began cracking down on dissent in @entity13 , many activists and residents have fled the city			2
other things the extremist group have forbidden @entity2 in @entity13 from doing include : -- exposing crosses or their books to @entity79 ; -- making any recitations or ringing any church bells that can be heard by @entity79 ; -- trading pigs or alcohol to @entity79 or in their markets ; -- drinking alcohol in public .			2

@entity13 was once one of the nation 's most liberal cities
the militants are also forbidding @entity2 from repairing churches and monasteries
the heavy restrictions are not surprising coming from @entity10
