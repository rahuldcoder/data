-- ever since @entity2 's head was smashed into a block of ice he 's had trouble hearing			0
the @entity7 man , whose name has been changed for his safety , was on a fishing boat in @entity11 last year when it happened			2
he had left @entity7 , also known as @entity7 , thinking he was going to work in a factory processing pineapple			0
but when he arrived in @entity11 , he says , his recruiters sold him to a boat captain for the equivalent of around $ 430			2
after being held on the vessel for 10 months , working against his will and suffering regular beatings , he finally managed to escape			0
@entity2 's story features in the @entity22 ' latest report on countries efforts to fight modern slavery around the world			1
it echoes numerous other accounts told by trafficking survivors to international media and human rights groups in @entity11 in recent years			1
many are foreign migrants who report being forced into labor or prostitution ; some face physical abuse or even death			2
the lucky ones escape or know someone who can pay the exorbitant price for their release			0
for four years the @entity41 has warned @entity11 that it has n't been doing enough to combat human trafficking			1
it said the country was a source , transit point and destination for trafficking , with ethnic minorities and citizens of neighboring countries at particular risk of exploitation in the sex trade and forced labor			2
in the @entity41 's 2012 and 2013 @entity55 ( @entity57 ) report , @entity11 faced relegation to the worst category , but received waivers based on a plan to bring itself into compliance with minimum standards for eliminating trafficking			1
on friday , when the @entity41 released its 2014 report , it automatically downgraded @entity11 to the lowest possible ranking , after the country reached its limit of waivers and failed to show significant improvement			1
now , the @entity72 nation shares the " @entity79 " category with 22 other countries , putting it on par with the likes of @entity76 , @entity77 and the @entity78			0
@entity82 , the permanent secretary to @entity11 's @entity84 , called the move " a great disappointment			1
" " i do know that @entity11 has been doing much better than those countries in that category , " he said			2
" so i ask @entity22 whether @entity11 should be in that category			1
" @entity90 said @entity11 will continue efforts to tackle this problem			1
the downgrade means @entity11 could see the withdrawal of non-humanitarian @entity22 assistance , and its opposition to funding from international institutions like the @entity99 and @entity100			1
although anti-trafficking advocates , like the @entity102 to end @entity103 and @entity55 , believe the @entity22 is unlikely to impose such sanctions in practice to preserve security , and economic ties between the two nations			2
progress ? @entity11 authorities acknowledge there is a problem			2
" human trafficking is one of the worst forms of human indignity and @entity11 is committed to eliminating this inhumane exploitation , " the @entity11 ambassador to the @entity22 , @entity112 , said in a recent press statement			1
but he insisted significant progress has been made in tackling the issue , and that efforts made in 2013 exceeded the @entity41 's criteria for an upgrade			1
" we 're not doing it just because it might impact our trade ... we think that it 's a scourge that needs to be eradicated in @entity11 and other countries , " @entity112 told @entity0			1
he pointed to the number of trafficking convictions -- 225 defendants were convicted in 2013 , over four times more than the previous year			0
the government took legal action against more than 150 illegal labor recruitment companies for alleged corruption , forced labor , human trafficking and smuggling			1
the police carried out over 28,000 police inspections in workplaces suspected of being used for commercial sex and forced labor , he said			0
" so in total , i think that we 've been doing a lot , but we acknowledge the fact that much more needs to be done , " he added			0
yet @entity11 's law enforcement efforts remain " insufficient " compared to the size of the issue , the @entity41 said			1
" in @entity11 , we have a lot of beginnings that will hopefully come to fruition , but the report does n't look at promises , it looks at results , " said @entity150 , the @entity22 ambassador - at - large to @entity152			1
" in this coming year , we hope we 'll see success with the new round of cases that there have been some arrests in			0
we 're seeing some good numbers from police , but what happens when the prosecutors get the cases ? what happened when the judges hear the cases ? " @entity172 , slavery at sea two of the biggest areas of concern are sex trafficking , and forced labor , especially in the fishing industry			0
the majority of @entity11 victims identified during 2013 were found in the country 's billion dollar sex industry , according to the @entity41			1
the exact number of women and children exploited through prostitution in @entity11 is unknown , but estimates from researchers and non-profit groups put the figure in the tens of thousands			2
victims are subject to sex trafficking in venues that cater to local demand , along with establishments in tourist hubs like @entity199 and @entity200 that cater to foreigners , the @entity41 said			2
@entity11 is also the world 's third - largest exporter of seafood			2
a 2013 study published by the @entity207 's @entity206 ( @entity206 ) found that 17 % of around 600 fishermen in @entity11 said they worked against their will and were unable to leave for threat of financial penalties , the threat of violence or being reporting to authorities			2
around six in 10 migrants who had been forced to work on @entity11 fishing boats said they had seen the murder of another worker , according to a 2009 survey from the @entity220			0
corruption according to the @entity41 , @entity11 's efforts to address trafficking are being hampered by " corruption at all levels			1
" some corrupt officials have even protected brothels and food processing facilities from raids and inspections , the @entity57 report said			0
police officers at the local and national level , who had been assigned to regions notorious for trafficking , formed protective relationships with traffickers			0
immigration officials and police have allegedly sold migrants who were unable to pay labor brokers and sex traffickers , according to the report			0
" there are cases of suspected corruption , and in all the cases , investigations have been or are being carried out , " ambassador @entity112 said			0
" at least 33 police officers and also five high - ranking police officials were , or are being , punished under the civil or criminal processes			0
so many of the cases are still in the process but many have been punished already			0
" the @entity41 acknowledged @entity11 has improved its system for collecting anti-trafficking data , but says authorities have demonstrated little effort in addressing reports of debt bondage among foreign migrants in commercial sectors , and have not made " sufficient efforts " to proactively identify trafficking victims			1
it also warned that the use of harsh criminal defamation laws to prosecute those who researched or reported on trafficking " may have discouraged efforts " to combat the practice			0
@entity270 asylum seekers one particular area of concern , according to the @entity41 , are reports of trafficking of @entity7 's @entity276 minority -- many of whom have fled ethnic and religious violence in the country in recent years and pass through neighboring countries , including @entity11			1
they are among those most vulnerable to being trafficked , the @entity41 says			0
" we 're concerned about the @entity270 -- the refugees and asylum seekers			0
we are concerned that some of them have been subjected to sex trafficking and forced labor , " said @entity150			0
" we want the @entity11 government to investigate and duly address those things			0
" but when @entity11 submitted its 2013 trafficking data to the @entity22 for the trafficking in @entity297 project in march , officials said they found no evidence that @entity270 were victims of trafficking , because their transit through @entity11 was voluntary			1
this conflicted with reports from local ngos and media groups : at least 40,000 ethnic @entity270 and @entity305 passed through trafficking camps in @entity11 in 2013 , according to @entity307 , director of the human rights group , the @entity308			1
although she points out that it 's a rough estimate because it 's difficult to trace every single migrant boat			0
on friday , the @entity11 ambassador to the @entity22 told @entity0 that while most of the @entity270 cases involved willful smuggling , towards the end of the reporting period , december 2013 , there were cases of trafficking also			1
" those cases are being investigated and will be dealt with in next year 's report i 'm sure , " he said			0
@entity11 is not alone in struggling to demonstrate it is serious about fighting trafficking			2
@entity326 , its southern neighbor , has also been downgraded to tier 3 in this year 's report , and all other nations it shares borders with remain on the @entity41 's watch list			1
countries like @entity11 and @entity326 will need to show " results " if they want to get off the @entity41 's list next year , @entity150 said			1
@entity0 's @entity333 contributed to this report .			0

@entity22 says @entity11 is n't doing enough to fight human trafficking
@entity11 could face sanctions as a result of @entity41 's annual report
@entity11 's ambassador to the @entity22 says " significant efforts " have been made to tackle problem
countries need to show " results " not only promises , @entity41 says
