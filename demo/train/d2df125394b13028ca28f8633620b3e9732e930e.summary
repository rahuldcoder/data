@entity0 -- reality for @entity4 's @entity3 has been a challenge , starting at age 7 , when she was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia			1
" i was told i would n't live past 30 , i would be disabled my whole life and i would never become a mother , " @entity3 , a member of one of the most successful girl groups ever , told @entity1			1
" my daughter is @entity14			2
i 've traveled the world in one of the best groups ever			2
" reality called again five years ago when doctors found a brain tumor , which left her partially blind and deaf			1
" but after losing my sight , hearing , balance and speech , yes , i 'm returning , " said @entity3 , whose real name is @entity3			1
" i had to take three years to heal and fight for everything that i wanted back			2
@entity3 is sharing the lessons learned from hard reality in a reality tv show that premieres tuesday night , coincidentally on a network with the same name as her group -- @entity4			1
" it 's about 20 years later , me coming back from the brain tumor and doing things i want to do , " she said			1
" you 'll hear about all that in the show , my real - life struggles , being a single mother			2
i do n't care how much money you have in the world			2
it 's not about that			2
it 's all about time			2
i 'm in charge of raising a young woman one day , to be a mother and hopefully a wife			1
as you know , being a parent , that 's probably the hardest job ever " " @entity59 " is real -- especially compared with most shows , she said : " they 're fake as all get - out , right ? i 'm real			1
" her experience with reality tv includes being fired by @entity64 on " @entity65 " in 2009			2
" if i 'm not the chick you want , because you do n't want that , then they 'll probably censure me , " she said			1
" that 's fine , but i 'm staying me , because i 'm happy and i 've always been happy in my skin			1
" like other entertainers who disappear from the spotlight for a while , @entity3 never stopped working while she focused on raising her daughter and fighting for her health			1
" i get a lot of ' oh , you 've been gone , ' " she said			2
" i was n't gone			2
just because you did n't see me does n't mean i was n't working and collecting checks			2
i just was n't singing and doing videos			0
i do a lot of other things , like i said , like writing scripts and stuff like that			0
i write for other artists			0
" when a doctor told her that her headaches were caused by a tumor , " i said ' say huh ? say huh ? " she said			1
the diagnosis triggered a string of emotions , but never anger , she said			0
" i had that fight , " she said			0
" i want to live			0
i did n't have time to die			0
" the hardest time was not knowing if the tumor was cancerous and if it would kill her , she said			1
she began a desperate search for doctors she trusted who did not look at her " just like i was a dollar sign , " she said			0
" they 're like , ' you know , sickle cell can cause complications because it will turn on your body , your heart and lungs			1
you could just die , have a stroke , " she said			0
" i was like , @entity115 , @entity116 , what 's going on ? " some doctors told her removing her tumor through surgery would be too complicated			1
" it 's just like they wanted to still keep the tumor in my head , and maybe burn some of your cells and you may not remember something			1
" " in my gut , i know if i had stayed in @entity129 , and let them touch me , i would n't be here , " she said			0
" i was n't going to make it through those surgeries			0
i was going to die			0
" she chose a @entity0 doctor to oversee her treatment and brain surgery at @entity138			1
" i said , ' i know this is him in my heart , " she said			0
" i packed up my stuff and my family and i came here			0
" but she had to make a decision			0
" i had to give the order of what i wanted to be saved , " she said			0
" so i said my face first , because you could n't look at me and tell i 'm deaf or blind			1
my hearing second , because i still want to hear and sing and have my speech			1
so they took my balance completely from the right			2
" but after three years of physical therapy to teach her brain how to compensate for the loss of balance , " mostly everything else is back			1
i can hear and see and i can speak , " she said			0
" so i am blessed			0
" when you meet her now , it 's hard now to tell anything was ever wrong with @entity3			1
" i still have a crooked smile and just certain things i deal with , but i 'll take all of that to be back here and be @entity14 's mother , " she said			0
predictions of her lifespan are still pessimistic , but her optimism rejects them			0
" now they 're saying 45 , and i plan to be talking to y'all at 56 , " she said			0
" i 'd rather take over the disease than let it take over me			0
let 's put it that way			0
" @entity3 has a lot left to do			1
this year is the 20th anniversary of when she teamed with @entity182 and @entity183 as @entity4			1
@entity184 is producing a bio-pic about them , which means @entity3 is back in the studio working on the soundtrack			1
" it 's going to be hard to see who can dance like us , " she said			0
" i do n't even think i could do me again			0
could i do @entity3 again the way i did it ? " the reunited group -- with a replacement for @entity182 , who died in a 2002 auto accident in @entity199 -- will also tour to support the release of a new album , which includes two new singles			1
