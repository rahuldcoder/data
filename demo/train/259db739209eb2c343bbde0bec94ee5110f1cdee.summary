-- if event registration site @entity5 's experience is any indication , social media marketers looking for monetary returns on their efforts might get more value from @entity9 than @entity10			1
the company announced wednesday that an average tweet about an event drove 80 cents in ticket sales during the past six months , whereas an average @entity15 drove $ 1.34			1
the study , which used in - house social analytics tools to track ticket sales on the site , was a continuation of a similar analysis the company released in october after analyzing data from a 12 - week period			1
that study also indicated @entity9 drove more sales for @entity5 than @entity10 , although the difference between the two networks ' sales per post was greater at that point than throughout the entire six - month period ( the " value " of tweets increased )			1
in addition to each individual @entity9 like driving more sales than an individual tweet , the study also revealed cumulative activity on @entity9 was greater than activity on @entity10 for @entity5			1
people shared @entity5 events on @entity9 almost four times as often as they did on @entity10			1
the company attributes this disparity to @entity9 's wider reach and greater emphasis on real - world ties			2
it 's important to note that only a very small percentage of site visitors shared event pages on either network			0
just 1 % of people who landed on an event page shared it with their friends ; 10 % of people who had purchased a ticket did the same			2
obviously people are more likely to share events if they are attending			0
their friends , according to @entity5 's data , are also more likely to buy tickets to an event shared on @entity9 by a ticket holder than one shared by an uncommitted friend			2
but whether these trends , or any of @entity5 's findings , are relevant to other types of purchases is still a matter of speculation			0
but @entity5 is betting they are			0
" we carefully track sharing behavior in an effort to help event organizers tap into a new world of distribution for their event promotion , " wrote @entity73 , @entity5 's director of marketing and former senior analyst at @entity75 , in a blog post about the study			0
" but the findings apply broadly to all e-commerce businesses , because the foundations of e-commerce are shifting as the social graph becomes a meaningful influence in driving transactions			0
