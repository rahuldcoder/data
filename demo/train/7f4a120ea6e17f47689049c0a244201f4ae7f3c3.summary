this week president @entity0 did a swing through some college campuses talking about student loan debt			1
the immediate issue is the 3.4 % interest rate on federal student loans			1
it 's set to double july 1 unless @entity9 acts			1
keeping the rate low in this still weak economy is , as the president said , a no - brainer			2
even his opponent @entity14 has endorsed it			0
but the larger problem -- mounting college costs and a cumulative $ 1 trillion in student loan debt — remains untouched			1
some recent polls have shown that support for @entity0 among young voters , once @entity0 's enthusiastic fans , may be waning in this election compared with four years ago			1
student loans are seen by some as the president 's chosen key to regaining their hearts			1
but really , the issue has been raised for him by the @entity32 , gearing up this may 1 with a new set of actions focusing on the cost of college and the depredations of the student loan industry			2
additionally , almost 700,000 people have signed a petition sponsored by @entity41 for student loan forgiveness , started by lawyer and student - loan debtor @entity45			2
and the @entity46 of 2012 , introduced by @entity48 rep. @entity47 , @entity49 , last month , is aimed at offering relief			2
what 's at stake here is the basic equation of the @entity48 dream : hard work plus merit equals opportunity			0
as usually happens , hard times have led to cuts in support to public education and attendant tuition hikes			0
young people are graduating into a dismal job market with an average of more than $ 25,000 in debt			1
loan default rates were up sharply last year , and many graduates are questioning the value of their education			0
in eight years of covering and advocating for student debtors , i 've never seen such a level of public outcry			0
the president and his @entity77 deserve credit for keeping the heat on student loan and college cost issues , and not just at campaign time			0
their most important move was probably the government takeover of the student loan market			2
as of july 1 , 2010 , all federally subsidized student loans — about 80 % of the total — have been originated by the @entity77			1
the deal ended billions of dollars in unnecessary subsidies to lenders like @entity92 and , in theory at least , empowered the government to set repayment terms friendlier to student lenders			0
unfortunately , the measures proposed so far -- freezing interest rates , income - based repayment and public service loan forgiveness -- have n't gone far enough to improve the lot of students and recent grads			1
there are indications that the specialized repayment programs , designed to make loans cheaper for low earners and those employed by the government or nonprofits , are undersubscribed because of red tape and a lack of publicity			0
there is a simpler way to cut the gordian knot of rising debt and college costs , one that would help desperate graduates in the short term and lower the cost of college in the long term			0
the answer is bankruptcy relief for both federal and private student loans			1
since 1998 , federally subsidized student loans have been non-dischargeable in bankruptcy , except in rare cases involving permanent disability or death			1
since 2005 , even private , unsubsidized student loans -- the fastest - growing , highest - cost type of student loan , tantamount to putting college on your credit card -- have been immune to bankruptcy claims , as well			1
without bankruptcy , lenders have little interest in negotiating			2
falling behind on your loans can spiral into a hellish decades - long nightmare of interest rates and penalties soaring many times beyond the original sum			2
for federal borrowers , the government can garnish your wages without taking you to court , seize tax refunds and even @entity158			0
allowing anyone who faces unreasonable student loan sums compared with their income to seek relief through the courts , as we do with every other kind of debt , would end the horror stories			1
it would also likely have several ripple effects			0
private loans would decrease , and the federal government , facing a potential liability of $ 100 billion a year , would have a reason to get more serious about college costs and productivity			0
this could lead to , among other things , an expansion of the gainful employment rule , which sanctions schools that prepare very few of their students to be solvent			0
in the long run , we 'd probably see more innovative low - cost learning alternatives , such as the free online courses being offered by @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity191 professors through the new ventures @entity193 , @entity194 , and @entity195			0
bankruptcy relief on student loans is n't just fair , it 's the first step to a more functional market in higher education .			1

the interest rate on student loans will soon double unless @entity9 acts
@entity204 says @entity0 showed concern over student debt during visits to colleges
but proposed relief measures do n't go far enough ; bankruptcy relief is needed , she says
@entity204 : bankruptcy relief is fair , a first step to more functional education market
