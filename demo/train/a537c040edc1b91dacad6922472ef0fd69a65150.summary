-- @entity2 founder and ceo @entity1 rescued sunken treasure in the @entity5 this year : components of two @entity8 rocket engines			1
now he says he has verified that they are engines from @entity10 , the first mission that took @entity12 astronauts to the moon			1
the timing , as @entity1 is aware , is appropriate			2
saturday is the anniversary of the 1969 moon landing			1
" 44 years ago tomorrow @entity18 stepped onto the moon , and now we have recovered a critical technological marvel that made it all possible , " @entity1 wrote on his blog			1
@entity1 congratulated the conservation team at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , for its efforts			2
one of the conservators discovered that the number " 2044 " had been stenciled in black paint on the side of one of the massive thrust chambers			0
he found it while using a black light and a special lens filter			0
this 2044 was not a mystery			0
according to @entity1 , it corresponds to @entity39 number 6044 , the serial number for f - 1 engine no. 5 from the @entity10 mission			1
the conservator continued his work on this thrust chamber and , after removing more corrosion , found a stamp on the metal surface that said " @entity49 2044			2
" " conservation is painstaking work that requires remarkable levels of patience and attention to detail , and these guys have both , " @entity1 said of the @entity25 conservators			2
an internet retail mogul might seem an unusual patron of @entity10 artifacts and history			2
but @entity1 said he was inspired to dream big by watching the original moon mission as a 5 - year - old in 1969			1
more in space news : ok , everybody , wave at @entity68 ! the @entity2 chief announced in march that his team of researchers had discovered a set of giant rocket engines that he described as " an underwater wonderland -- an incredible sculpture garden of twisted @entity8 engines			1
" they were found in 14,000 feet of water off the @entity80 coast			0
@entity8 engines powered the @entity83 rocket carrying @entity18 , @entity84 and @entity85 on the @entity10 mission to the moon			1
at an altitude of about 38 miles , the first stage of the spacecraft , including the engines , separated			0
these parts were considered destroyed or lost forever			0
@entity1 had said in 2012 that he wanted to find the @entity10 rocket engines but noted that many serial numbers are completely or partly missing			1
" the components ' fiery end and heavy corrosion from 43 years underwater removed or covered up most of the original serial numbers , " he wrote on his blog friday			0
more in space news : gold comes from collisions of dead stars , scientists say each of the engines weighs nearly 9 tons , and they came in a cluster of five			0
they provided 32 million horsepower by burning 6,000 pounds of fuel every second , and together , they lifted the largest rocket in history 38 miles above the @entity112 in less than three minutes			0
after separation , the rocket engines made their re-entry at 5,000 miles per hour , @entity1 said , and then plummeted into the ocean			1
that 's where they remained , undiscovered for decades , until @entity1 ' team found them using sophisticated sonar			1
" the technology used for the recovery is in its own way as otherworldly as the @entity126 technology itself , " @entity1 wrote in march			2
" the @entity127 worked at a depth of more than 14,000 feet , tethered to our ship with fiber optics for data and electric cables transmitting power at more than 4,000 volts			0
" his team felt the echoes of the moon mission as they probed the icy depths of the ocean : " the blackness of the horizon			1
the gray and colorless ocean floor			0
" having taken space venturers to the moon , the engines are now the treasure of a different breed of explorers			2
@entity1 said he intends to put the hardware on display " where just maybe it will inspire something amazing			0
" follow @entity154 on @entity155 at @ lizlandau @entity0 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0

conservator found serial number of @entity10 rocket engine
@entity2 ceo @entity1 had sought to *confirm* engines were from that famous mission
a @entity1 - led team recovered the engines in march from the depths of the @entity5
