the case was turned over to the sheriff 's office , and after an initial investigation , investigators notified school authorities , who removed @entity14 from his classroom in january 2011			1
about 400 photographs collected by investigators show children blindfolded , with tape over their mouths , @entity107 said			0
at least 23 children in the images have been identified , while another 10 are unidentified , he said			0

" it took us another six to seven months to process @entity14 's dna and match it with the classroom dna sample that tested positive for semen , " he said			0

the young students " did n't realize they were victimized , " @entity107 said			0
" they thought they were being blindfolded and gagged as a game			0
" @entity14 's public defender has not spoken to reporters about the case , which is set for arraignment on february 21			2
