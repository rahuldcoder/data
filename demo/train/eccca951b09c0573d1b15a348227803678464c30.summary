@entity0 -- i 've been camping countless times in the forest -- as one does -- and without fail , there 's always plenty of wood just lying around			1
plenty of concrete might indicate that , perhaps , you 've somehow pitched a tent in @entity13			2
but in the forest , there 's definitely wood			0
that 's how forests work , and it 's actually the first question in their job interview			0
" do you make wood ? " " yes			0
" " lots of wood ? " " yes			0
" yet , despite all the trees , at no point in my many outdoor adventures have i ever consider whipping out a saw and hauling back a medium - sized log with the intention of selling it to sheltered city folk as an ironic , rustic home furnishing			1
that would just be ridiculous			0
which is why -- of course -- a furniture store exists in @entity0 where they 've literally price - tagged a plain stump of wood for $ 98 @entity44			1
which , these days , counts as real money ! mind you , this stump -- which is n't intricately carved or decorated or manipulated in any way from its natural form -- will not charge your @entity52 , it wo n't make you an omelet , and i 'm pretty sure it does n't come with @entity55			1
it 's just a stump			2
and it costs $ 98 ( that 's $ 94.84 in @entity60 dollars )			1
i first learned of this uber - log the other day when , prior to a work trip to @entity44 , i was searching @entity62 for popular and unusual topics relating to @entity0			1
almost immediately , i found a link to a photo of the log with the topic headline , " i submit proof that @entity0 is the @entity69			1
" though that original post was actually created more than a month ago , it remained popular within the @entity72			0
thus , when i got to town i simply had to see if this thing was for real			2
so , when i had a few spare minutes , i made a special trip over to @entity76 , a trendy little store in the heart of the city , just to have a look			2
the exact stump from @entity62			2
only now somebody had added a " y " to the tag so it read " @entity86			0
" perhaps this was a shout out to the animated series " @entity90 , " which , when i initially saw the log online , was the very first thing that came to my head			1
back in the early 1990s , the completely warped ( and brilliant ) somehow - for - children 's cartoon gave us a musical segment called " @entity98			1
" it was a parody commercial where a bratty kid pines not for a bike or a video game but for a giant piece of wood			0
the song ends with a jubilant cry : " come on and get your log ! everyone needs a log ! " it was meant to be silly , of course			2
no kid would ever want a log over other exciting toys			2
maybe a @entity117 if they 're desperate			0
or if they just really , really enjoy choking			0
either way , log appears to be making a comeback			2
i spoke with a sales clerk at @entity76 who ( quite rightfully ) seemed both uneasy and taken aback by my multitude of questions regarding the stump			2
but i 'm a serious journalist , and i needed answers			0
and he was the unlucky bastard who had to deal with me			0
" people live far from nature , " the clerk politely explained before finally conceding , " but if you live in the country , you 're like , what the hell is that ? " he also enthusiastically added , " wait till you see the new stumps we have ! " i 'm sure they 're wonderful			0
but what may be more interesting than this $ 98 chunk of wood is the @entity147 declaring @entity0 as the hipster capital of the universe			1
because , really , what is the hipster capital of the universe ? from an international perspective , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 all seemed to pop up on several online lists			1
@entity0 never made an appearance			1
here in the @entity160 , @entity159 ranked the best overall @entity60 cities for hipsters , and @entity163 , @entity164 , came out no. 1 , followed by @entity165			0
but multiple other websites suggest the true hipster mecca is either @entity168 in @entity169 or @entity170 , a funky neighborhood in @entity172			1
as i kept seeing the word @entity170 pop up , it took me a few minutes to figure out where this actually was			1
at first i thought everyone was talking about @entity170			1
and that sort of blew my mind			0
i was dumbfounded that , perhaps , hordes of bearded dudes with cutoff shorts and bicycles had somehow sacked the city and turned @entity186 into @entity187			0
@entity170 has not been taken over by hipsters , and it delightfully remains a family - friendly tourist destination in @entity190 where you can relive the glory days of smallpox			1
regardless , if people want a quality , medium - sized chunk of hipster wood , apparently they 'll have to visit @entity76 in @entity0			1
because it 's either that or venture from your tent to find a stump somewhere in the deeps of the forest			2
just beware of the bear			0
note : after this column was published , i received an e-mail from the store 's owner , @entity211 , who was kind enough to give me a little more of the stump 's backstory			1
in his own words : " it 's a small piece of a 160 year old barn with the original hand - squaring marks from the poor pioneer bastard who made it with a straight axe and a lot of sweat			0
" still looks like a chunk of wood to me , but i definitely dig the history !			0

a store in *downtown* @entity0 is selling a tree stump for $ 98
the log *harkens* back to the *classic* cartoon " @entity90 "
@entity170 ( @entity172 ) might be the real the hipster capital of the universe
