after @entity1 posted a picture of her and @entity3 , it only took vice president @entity4 a few days to one - up the former secretary of state			1
@entity6 had offered to write a " theme " song for @entity9 's presidential campaign , should she decide to run in 2016 , after the two met at a book signing in @entity13 for @entity9 's memoir " @entity15			1
" then @entity4 made his move : he invited the pop star to the @entity18 , posed for a selfie with her and even got on the phone with her grandmother			2
" what a @entity26 , " @entity6 captioned the @entity24 photo of her and @entity4 , who is a fan , a @entity18 official told @entity27			2
@entity6 's fans seemed to agree and less than 24 hours after it was posted , the vice presidential selfie beat out @entity6 's photo with @entity9 by several thousand likes			2
that 's a @entity34 , as @entity4 might say			2
it 's not the first time @entity4 has trumped @entity9 news with a little " news " of his own as speculation simmers about whether they will run for the presidency in 2016			1
when @entity9 said she had n't driven a car in nearly 20 years , @entity4 was quick to profess his love of @entity47 sports cars and even suggested that not being able to drive the new corvette could be the one reason he does n't run for president			1
" i 'd like to get that @entity51 from 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds , " @entity4 said in february			2
and then @entity9 tried to climb out of the hole she had dug by saying her family was in debt and " dead broke " after leaving the @entity18			2
oh yeah ? @entity57 broke ? well the vice president does n't even have a savings account , @entity4 said just a day after @entity9 reignited the controversy over her wealth			1
" do n't hold it against me i do n't own a single stock or bond , " @entity4 continued			1
" do n't hold it that i have no savings account			0
" while the @entity69 ' investments are listed in his wife 's name , the vice president does in fact have several savings accounts			0
but that 's not the point , jabbin ' @entity4 would say			0
remember instead that he was listed as one of the poorest members of @entity78 when he was a senator			0
and then there 's their new bff @entity1			0
oh , @entity3 -- you just met her and her posse ? " i 've known them for like seven years ... so , just a little bit longer			0
i 've just known them for a really long time ... so , longer			0
so , just better friends			0
" wait -- that 's not @entity4			0
it 's a quote from @entity90 , the absurdly competitive @entity91 character played by @entity92 who has an overpowering urge to outshine everyone around her			0
the back and forth between @entity9 and @entity4 even prompted @entity96 to call a " poor - off " to settle the would - be - rivals ' competing claims			1
" do n't hold it against me but my clothes are made of old curtains " @entity96 as @entity4 said			1
@entity96 even nicknamed the veep , @entity4 " i 'm - allergic - to - money " @entity4			0
but the polls show @entity9 is the clear frontrunner among @entity107 for 2016 , with @entity4 a distant second			1
while they 're both considering their options , @entity4 's got to keep himself in the headlines			0
and apparently letting @entity9 set up his punch lines has helped @entity4 flaunt his qualities and accomplishments			1
@entity9 has touted her travel credentials -- 112 countries and nearly 1 million miles -- during her whirlwind book tour			1
but the day @entity9 's book was released , @entity4 brought up his own encounters with world leaders and the frequent flier miles he has racked up as vice president -- more than 900,000			1

beyond the @entity1 *primary* , @entity4 has apparently picked up on other @entity9 comments
after @entity9 said she has n't driven in over 20 years , @entity4 played up his love of cars
@entity4 played up his ' *modest* ' means after @entity9 was *slammed* for playing down her wealth
as @entity9 touts her *extensive* travel , @entity4 also *stressed* his frequent flier credentials
