-- first came the stuff that floats on the surface and is pushed by wind : @entity4 , a soccer ball , flotation devices			2
and , most notably , a rust - stained unmanned fishing trawler in @entity9 waters			1
communities in @entity9 , @entity11 , the @entity12 and @entity13 are preparing for the main event from debris pushed offshore by last year 's massive @entity17 earthquake and tsunami			1
about 70 % of the debris sank , according to @entity17 government estimates			1
no one knows how much of the remaining 1.5 million tons of debris is still floating in the @entity21			1
but @entity23 and state officials say that some items washing ashore may be from the disaster , which took place 13 months ago and nearly 5,000 miles away			1
thousands of people were killed			2
" our models show the outer edge of the debris is at the @entity12 and @entity9 now , " @entity28 , program director and division chief of the @entity31 's @entity30 , said wednesday			1
the bulk of the debris is north of @entity11 , slowly moving east			1
in @entity38 , there have been reports of lumber , lightbulbs and fishing items reaching land			1
their source has not been confirmed			0
officials ca n't rule out they came from the tsunami , according to @entity48 , communications manager at the the state 's @entity49			1
a volunteer helping in a beach cleanup this weekend along the @entity38 coast said she found items that appeared to include @entity17 writing , according to @entity57 affiliate king			1
that does n't prove they were part of the tsunami debris , officials caution			1
@entity31 said there is no current " debris field			1
" rather , items , large and small , are scattered over a huge swath of the @entity21 and may make landfall intermittently			1
residents are being told to expect reports of debris to increase and continue over the next couple of years			1
what might they see ? for starters , building materials , fishing nets and gear , plastic , barrels and hazardous materials			0
@entity80 , state and local officials held a workshop in @entity82 , @entity38 , on wednesday , to discuss strategies for handling additional debris			1
the workshop followed a round of meetings in @entity38 communities			0
" i think my folks have heard a little bit of everything at these meetings , " said @entity89 , communications director for the @entity38 @entity90			0
" the great majority who have come have been low - key about it			0
" some people have asked whether any bodies will come ashore			1
the top concern is whether radioactive material from the @entity103 nuclear power plant will make landfall			0
@entity31 has said that scenario is highly unlikely			0
" we do not expect to see anything to wash up from @entity17 with elevated levels of radiation , " said @entity89			0
" at the same time , we fully appreciate the concern of people			0
if you spend a lot of time on the coast , if you see the news coverage , you want to see you are safe			0
" a beach cleanup this past weekend along the @entity38 shore included checks with radiation - detecting equipment , according to @entity121			0
" there just had not been anything so far			0
" no single government agency is in charge of patrolling and cleaning beaches ; hence the planning and public information campaign			0
" we are poised ... with a well - coordinated response , " said @entity48 of the state ecology department			0
" we are going to see items from the tsunami on our beaches			1
" of concern for his agency is the potential for oil or chemical drums or fuel cylinders to come ashore			1
that risk could increase as the region sees normal stormy weather kick up later this year , according to @entity48			2
the @entity145 is focusing on pollution threats and any impediments to navigation , according to lt. @entity149 , a public affairs officer in @entity38			0
@entity150 , a physical oceanographer with the @entity151 in @entity152 , said the debris was initially carried on the swift @entity155 current , but slowed as it joined another current west of @entity11			1
" it is now scattered over 4,000 miles in one direction and 1,000 miles in another area , " @entity150 said			0
" the front edge of it has gotten here and the whole cloud should arrive at the end of another year			2
" to better pinpoint the debris and update models , @entity31 has turned to satellite images and reports from commercial shipping lines , according to @entity171 of the marine debris program			1
" it is extremely spread out , and if you were sailing through it you would not see much , " said @entity150			0
earlier this month , the @entity145 opened fire on the drifting 200 - foot trawler 180 miles southwest of @entity178 , @entity9 , after it determined the " unmanned , unlit , unmarked vessel " posed a hazard to mariners and the marine environment			1
it was a dramatic end for the @entity17 squid trawler			0
it was bound for a scrap yard before becoming part of the debris			2
the soccer ball that recently washed up on a remote @entity9 beach apparently belonged to a teenager from a @entity17 city devastated by the earthquake and tsunami			1
@entity194 , a 16 - year - old high school student , said he has " no doubt " that the ball is his after hearing that his name was among the characters written on it , @entity17 's @entity198 news agency reported			1
@entity31 blogs about the soccer ball ocean debris is nothing new , but " if you look at it over a long time , it is worse now than it has been , " said @entity171			2
plastic does not degrade , nor does fishing gear made of synthetic materials			0
" derelict fishing gear used to be made of ropes and would break down quicker , " she said			0
even with models and technology , predicting exactly where debris will come ashore is far from an exact science			1
" we can only forecast a few days into the future , because of wind and current , " @entity171 said			0
" we expect there to be an upswing in debris on the shore			2
the interesting thing is we do n't know where it 's going to be , and we think it is going to be spread out			2
" she cautioned against overreaction			0
" we do n't want people to cancel their beach vacation ( thinking ) it will be inundated with beach debris , " said @entity171			2
still , agencies want to be prepared , and officials understand concerns			2
" this is a really human tragedy that happened in @entity17 , " said @entity171			0
" it captured the media and public 's sympathy			2
afterward , you saw the videos of what was washed " out into the sea			0
@entity0 's @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			2

last year 's earthquake and tsunami sent tons of debris into @entity21
a portion of that headed east for @entity9 , @entity11 , @entity12
officials are receiving reports of items coming ashore
it 's *difficult* to predict exactly the path
