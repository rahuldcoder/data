@entity1 cooking can be seen as a metaphor for the country itself : it 's tart , sweet , fragrant and vastly complex			1
it 's one of the world 's oldest , yet largely obscure , culinary landscapes , with roots dating back to the @entity9			1
in homes in @entity11 , pots bubble for hours to braise tough cuts of meat in khoreshes , or stews , with all manner of local fruits like pomegranates and dried apricots and nuts like pistachios and walnuts			1
in the bazaars , there 's hot and fresh sangak , a staple oblong flatbread , and trays of sweet pastries perfumed with rose and orange blossom water			1
any visitor would be remiss to not try the chelo ( chelow ) kabab , as it 's king here ; juicy skewers of meat and minced meat are served on heaping plates of rice steamed with saffron , the most expensive spice in the world , and grilled tomatoes			1
here 's a recipe to get started with even if @entity47 is n't on your travel itinerary			1
@entity50 ( @entity51 - e kubideh ) ( serves 6 ) reprinted with permission by @entity53 from " @entity54 : @entity55 and @entity56 " by @entity57			1
for the kabab : 2 pounds twice - ground lamb shoulder or beef ( 85 % ) 2 teaspoons sea salt 2 teaspoons fresh ground black pepper ¼ teaspoon ground saffron dissolved in 1 tablespoon rose water , or ¼ teaspoon turmeric 2 tablespoons sumac powder ½ teaspoon baking soda 2 medium yellow onions , finely grated 2 cloves garlic , peeled and grated zest of 1 lime for basting : ½ cup salted butter or olive oil 1 teaspoon fresh lime juice for cooking and garnish : 14 flat 3/4 - inch skewers 1 package ( 12 ounces ) lavash bread ½ cup sumac powder 2 limes , cut in half , and @entity55 basil 1			1
to make the meat paste , in a warm , wide skillet , combine all the kabab ingredients			1
knead with your hands for about 5 minutes			1
cover the paste and let stand for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours in the refrigerator			1
start charcoal at least 30 minutes before you want to cook , and let it burn until the coals are glowing evenly			1
for this kabab , you want the coals to be as high as possible , close to the meat and at their hottest			1
do not spread the charcoal thin			2
if you are using an indoor grill , make sure it is preheated and very hot			2
using damp hands ( keep a bowl of water next to you ) , divide the meat paste into equal lumps about the size of small oranges			2
shape each into a 5 - inch - long sausage and mold it firmly around a flat , sword - like skewer			2
pinch the two ends to firmly attach meat to skewer			2
arrange on a baking sheet , separated from each other			2
cover and keep in a cool place			2
for the baste , melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the lime juice			2
spread lavash bread on a serving platter			0
arrange the skewers on the fire 3 inches above the coals ( bricks on either side make good platforms ; keep in mind that the ground meat should not touch the grill )			0
after a few seconds , turn the meat gently to help it attach to the skewers and to prevent it from falling off ( these first few seconds are important for cooking skewered ground kabab )			1
grill the meat for 3 to 5 minutes , turning frequently			0
baste just before removing from the fire			0
the meat should be seared on the outside , juicy and tender on the inside			0
place all the kabab skewers on the lavash bread platter			0
keep on skewers until ready to serve and cover with lavash bread to keep warm			0
loosen the meat from each skewer and slide the meat off using a piece of bread			0
sprinkle with sumac and lime juice to taste			0
serve with fresh basil and yogurt and cucumber dip			0
@entity160 - e @entity159 ! for a ground chicken variation : in a food processor , place 2 pounds chicken thighs , 1 small onion ( peeled and chopped ) , 3 cloves garlic ( peeled ) , zest of 2 limes , 2 teaspoons fine - grind sea salt , 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper , ¼ teaspoon ground saffron dissolved in 1 tablespoon rose water , and 1 tablespoon olive oil			0
pulse for a few minutes until you have a thick paste			0
do not over mix. transfer to a glass container			0
cover and allow to rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes			0
continue with step 2 .			0
