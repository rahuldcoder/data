-- it is by no accident that the @entity3 -- which now measures more than 50 miles laid @entity4 and weighs 54 tons -- is gracing the @entity5 in @entity6 this weekend as the global @entity8 and @entity9 community gathers nearby for the @entity10 ( @entity9 2012 )			1
as scientists , doctors , and program experts articulate a new and hopeful @entity9 narrative at the @entity16 , the quilt will serve as a not - so - gentle reminder that this devastating disease continues to claim the lives of too many , too soon			1
the quilt lends voice and volume to the nearly 94,000 individuals whose names are lovingly sewn into panels by more than 100,000 friends and family members -- and symbolically to the 1.2 million people living with @entity9 in this country alone			1
due to its vastness , the quilt blankets the national capital region , with sections of the tapestry on display in 50 other host venues throughout the area			1
today , worldwide , more than 34 million people now live with hiv / aids , and 3.4 million of them are under the age of 15			2
every day more than 7,000 people contract @entity41 € ” nearly 300 every hour			2
the global numbers are staggering , but so are some of the numbers in the hardest - hit cities in this country			0
indeed , recent research shows some @entity51 cities have @entity8 rates that rival @entity53 in their magnitude			0
opinion : end the @entity8 stigma yet behind the cold statistics , there are faces and stories with legacies			0
the faces on the quilt are our fathers , mothers , brothers , and sisters			2
they are our aunts and uncles , grandparents , daughters , sons , neighbors , our doctors and ministers , our best friends , and co-workers			0
and , after the tears that are shed for them subside , they are celebrated with lace and mink and bubble wrap ... with pearls and buttons , and their favorite t - shirt or logo stitched into the 3 - by - 6 - foot panels , roughly the size of a human grave			0
these are the stories and lives that together make up the world 's largest living work of folk art. throughout its 25 - year history , this masterpiece created " by the people , for the people " has been used to fight prejudice , and to raise awareness and funding for direct service and advocacy groups			1
the quilt is a catalyst and conduit , a tool for healing and grief therapy , a springboard for frank dialogue , both civic and private			2
it gives voice to far too many lives lost , telling us that never again should we ever leave a community in need and dying , ignored and uncared for			2
it is a stark reminder that we can never forget that we are all inextricably linked in life			2
in @entity51 : a quilt displays an @entity51 tragedy more than 20 million individuals around the world have attended displays and witnessed the extraordinary power , beauty , love , rage and sorrow of this multitude of voices			2
the quilt 's powerful lessons and poignant imagery provide compelling evidence that @entity9 can happen to anyone , anywhere , at any age			1
what started out as an activist action has become a powerful voice with artistic and cultural expression , now considered an @entity51 treasure by an act of @entity148			0
it is indeed difficult to walk away from the quilt , whether a single panel , a block , or miles of expressions of love on material , unmoved			0
and yet , unfortunately , almost every day , a new panel arrives at the @entity157 , which curates , cares for and manages the quilt			1
each new panel is then added to the quilt and helps to advance the cause of human rights and social justice			0
in 1988 , a lone panel was delivered quietly to the @entity157 in @entity165			0
unlike any other panel among the tens of thousands of panels made at that time , this special panel arrived simply with a handwritten note that read : " i hope this quilt will find a permanent place and help mark the end of this devastating disease			0
" the panel itself was stark in design , white letters on a black background , simply saying " @entity181			1
" in the decades since this panel was left on our doorstep , we have held on to it with hopeful anticipation that we would one day reach " @entity181			1
" we unveiled this panel publicly for the first time on the @entity5 during our opening ceremony saturday			1
( it will remain on display until wednesday			0
) we did so with heavy hearts , with hopeful hearts , but we still ca n't yet stitch it into the quilt			0
not until we see the last new infection , the last @entity9 case , the last death from @entity9 , the last one left orphaned , the last person to face discrimination for living with @entity8			1
in the meantime , as @entity202 goes about its mission to push the boundaries of science and medicine to find an end to the @entity208 , we will continue to preserve , care for , and use the @entity3 to foster healing , to be a bully pulpit for social justice and , most important , to inspire action in the age of @entity9 and beyond			1
everyone can help us live to honor " @entity181			1
" educate , help prevent infection , be an advocate , volunteer in the many communities around the country who host displays , donate to keep hope alive			0
only then will we know our work -- like the work of our scientists and researchers the world over -- by our artists and advocates , communities and corporate partners , friends and family members was not in vain			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1
