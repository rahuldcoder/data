-- since @entity4 , @entity2 and @entity3 administrations alike have consistently held the @entity5 out as a worldwide model for the protection and promotion of human rights standards			1
the @entity5 government has also consistently acknowledged the importance of all countries upholding and protecting universal human rights			1
indeed , on the 40th anniversary of the @entity16 , president @entity14 famously described the declaration as " a global testament of humanity , a standard by which any humble person on @entity22 can stand in judgment of any government on @entity22			0
" in recent years , one of the ways the @entity5 has sought to portray itself as a human rights leader is by regularly reporting on its compliance with domestic human rights obligations			1
former president @entity32 's administration submitted three major reports on domestic human rights treaty compliance to various international bodies of experts charged with overseeing treaty conformity			2
last month the @entity39 administration submitted a report to the @entity41 as part of its @entity44 process , through which the human rights records of all the countries in the world will be reviewed and assessed based on the obligations and commitments expressed in the universal declaration and other human rights instruments			1
the goal of the periodic review , and of human rights reporting in general , is to boost human rights compliance all over the world with powerful nations leading by example			1
on august 27 , @entity60 gov. @entity59 sought to make political hay out of the @entity5 report 's mere mention of @entity64 , the infamous @entity60 law that has drawn worldwide criticism for its potential to institutionalize racial profiling in @entity60			1
the @entity5 government 's reference to @entity64 in the periodic review report , which made no comment on the merits of the law , was brief ; it merely laid out some simple facts : the law generated significant attention around the world ( true ) ; the law is being addressed in a court action ( true ) ; parts of the law are currently enjoined ( true )			2
still , @entity59 sent a letter to the @entity83 expressing " concern and indignation " that the report included a reference to @entity64 at all			0
@entity59 's bizarre statement that this country 's participation in a human rights reporting process is " internationalism run amok " and " unconstitutional " ignores the fact that human rights reporting requires countries to report on issues at the federal , state and local levels			1
when the @entity32 administration reported on @entity5 compliance with the @entity103 , a treaty that the @entity5 has signed and ratified , the report included mentions of issues in states and in cities , in addition to national issues			2
in fact , human rights activists argued ( correctly ) that the @entity32 administration 's report insufficiently included information from states and cities			2
in response , the @entity83 under the leadership of both the @entity32 and @entity39 administrations has ( appropriately ) committed that the @entity5 will improve its reporting on both state and local issues			2
most international human rights treaties require regular reporting to encourage compliance by nations who are parties to these conventions			1
the " @entity142 " of the @entity141 describes ratified treaties as " the supreme law of the land , " so there is nothing unconstitutional about the @entity5 government complying with ratified treaties or reporting on compliance of ratified treaties ; in fact , one could very easily argue that reporting on treaty compliance is entirely consistent with the " intent of the framers " of the @entity141			2
further , @entity59 's suggestion that the human rights record of the @entity5 ( and @entity60 by inclusion ) be weighed against those of other nations participating in the periodic review process ( such as @entity149 ) is absurd , and her claim that the @entity5 would " win in any such comparison " rings hollow			1
the periodic review was established by the @entity154 as a process through which the human rights records of all the @entity154 ' 192 member states would be reviewed and assessed , so to single out @entity149 , or any other country , and compare it to the @entity5 is meaningless at worst and harmful at best			1
the @entity5 is the most powerful country in the world and it seeks to portray itself as a human rights leader			1
as a leader , it is incumbent upon the @entity5 to evaluate its own laws and make sure they meet the human rights standards set for the rest of the world			1
as such , it makes sense for the @entity5 to participate in the periodic review process , and to include @entity64 in its review , because not participating in the process and not mentioning an extremely controversial issue in the review would make the @entity5 appear to the rest of the world as though it had something to hide			0
what the @entity5 report does not say , and what @entity59 should be concerned about , is the fact that @entity64 violates @entity5 human rights obligations under the @entity181 , which is binding on all levels of federal , state and local governments			1
the convention obligates federal , state and local governments to guarantee that laws and policies do not discriminate , in purpose or effect , on the grounds of race , color , descent or national or ethnic origin			0
it also guarantees to all noncitizens , regardless of their immigration status , equal protection and equality before the law and prevents federal , state and local governments from employing or carrying out racial or ethnic discrimination against individuals or communities			0
racial profiling remains a pervasive problem all over the country and it is pretty difficult to argue that @entity64 will not have a disparate negative effect on communities of color , particularly @entity212 communities			0
@entity64 would require police to demand " papers " from all people that the police stop and suspect are not legally authorized to be in the @entity5			0
because , there is no clear bright - line identifier for who is legally authorized to be in the @entity5 , people who may be perceived to be " foreign " by police will be the subject of arrest , investigation or harassment simply because of who they are / what they look like , as opposed to because of any verifiable evidence of criminal activity			0
this will obviously have a disproportionately discriminatory impact on communities of color and immigrant communities , and that discriminatory impact violates @entity103			0
in a state like @entity60 , with a well documented history of racial profiling , there is even more cause for concern			0
enforcement of controversial provisions of the @entity60 law has been stopped by a federal judge while the merits of the case are being debated			0
the @entity5 government should not back down from its participation in human rights reporting			1
and it should go even further to create a concrete program of action to make sure state governments are aware of their legal obligations to protect and promote human rights			0
@entity59 should acquaint herself with the requirements of the @entity103 and the @entity141 , and commit to upholding human rights " close to home			2
" that would be real leadership and real courage and would help steer @entity60 ( and our country ) toward the fundamental values of fairness and equality			0
