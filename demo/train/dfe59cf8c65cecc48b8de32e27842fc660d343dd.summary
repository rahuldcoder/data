-- for the third time , @entity1 lowers the body of one of his children into the ground			2
he steps back as neighbors and relatives shovel dirt over his teenage daughter 's grave			2
he does not cry or wail			2
" i thank @entity12 this is my third martyr : @entity14 , @entity15 and now her			2
i thank @entity12 , and i will not say anything against his fate , " @entity1 told an activist filming the small funeral			2
just a few months ago , 18 - year - old @entity21 sang and danced with her mother and aunts as they dressed the bride in her wedding gown			1
now , her shattered and bloodied body lies in a grave below the crumbling , bullet - ridden buildings of @entity30			2
read more about @entity21 's wedding " she was killed and she took my heart , my soul , my mind and everything with her , but we will not give up			1
we must keep moving forward , " husband - turned - widower @entity37 said quietly			1
@entity21 did not lead battles or chair diplomatic talks			1
she is just like many other @entity41 -- young , hopeful , and now dead			1
" there was no daughter like her			2
she was bright and beautiful and playful			0
then the siege happened and with it her destiny , " @entity45 , @entity21 's mother , said as tears streamed down her face			1
@entity21 and @entity37 recently found out they were expecting their first child			1
the new family was elated , even as @entity53 estimates that 2.5 million people , including many children , are affected by the violence and instability in @entity41			1
" my love , she was only married a few months , then pregnant and now a martyr , " @entity21 's mother said			1
a 120 mm rocket fired into the family home struck @entity21 in the head , killing her and her unborn child instantly			1
@entity21 's father , who was standing nearby , was hit in the shoulder and wounded			1
" the week before she died , a rocket attack injured her hand , and i had this feeling in my heart that it was a sign			2
it was as if @entity12 gave us just one more week to take her in and say goodbye , " @entity37 said			0
young , defiant and in love brave and defiant , @entity21 hardly spoke of the frivolities of bridal gowns and wedding cake			1
" i wore a white dress , but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power , " @entity21 said in an interview shortly after getting married			1
" we hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding , because our happiness is the end of this government			0
" although @entity21 and @entity37 married just a week after meeting , the two were in love , her mother said			1
" she was young , and i had not planned on her marrying , but the siege brought her destiny			0
a young hardworking man liked her and she saw him and he saw her and they fell in love and got married , " @entity45 said , shaking her head as if trying to forget			0
the newlyweds saw their marriage as a symbol of the resistance against @entity41 president @entity105			1
for @entity37 , the part - time rebel fighter , revolution remained his shield , but the young man also believed living and loving was the greatest defiance of all			1
we were newlyweds and we were happy			0
even if she upset me i could not be mad at her			0
her gentleness captured my heart and i pray that @entity12 opens the gates of heaven for her , " he said , cracking a tiny smile as he remembered his wife			0
guns and battles are far from @entity37 's true passion : baking sweet desserts			0
the young pastry chef loves making indulgent treats for @entity30 ' fighters , families and children			0
" when i give a family sweets , it is as if i am handing them a treasure , " he said as he laughed loudly for the first time , thankful for the power of a single cookie in a city ravaged by war			2
@entity21 shared @entity37 's delight for delivering glimpses of joy through pastries drizzled with sweet " ater " or syrup , even as gas , flour , sugar and milk were in short supply			1
" she loved sweets , and more than that , she loved to watch me make them			0
we had even made date cookies and she died before she could eat them , so we gave them away , " @entity37 said , still smiling			0
a childhood cut short @entity21 was born and raised in the @entity158 of @entity30 , @entity41 's third largest city			1
her father was a laborer and her mother stayed at home with the kids , instilling in her the value of hard work and family			2
the third of five children , @entity167 's two older brothers spoiled the brown - eyed girl while the two younger siblings depended on her care			2
" she loved to study and she would always study			0
when the siege happened there were no schools left open , " @entity21 's mother said			1
more than 2,000 schools have been damaged or destroyed in civil war - related violence , and about 600 schools serve as makeshift shelters for internally displaced people , according to the @entity41 government			1
" she loved to help me with the housework , but i would not let her			0
i wanted her to study , " @entity45 said			0
the western city of @entity30 relies largely on industrial jobs			0
for @entity21 's family , education provided an opportunity for their children to escape manual labor in a country where the average monthly salary is $ 300			1
" she wanted to be an expert in @entity198 law -- maybe she could have even got her ph.d. if she got good grades , but @entity12 did not plan this for her , " @entity45 said			0
war and marriage the @entity41 uprising sparked by revolts across the @entity206 forever changed @entity21 's country and transformed @entity30 into a bastion of resistance against @entity105 's government			1
" ( @entity21 ) grew up on the love of @entity12 and when the demonstrations started she fell in love with the revolution and was very proud of her brothers who fought and died for freedom , " @entity1 said			1
@entity217 morphed into a full - scale civil war , consuming every corner of the beautiful country in a bloody and relentless fight for power			2
amid a stifling siege on @entity30 , where the @entity224 regularly blocked food , medicine and supplies , @entity37 and @entity21 got married			1
" i am very happy here with my life			0
here our life is better than a honeymoon outside our country			0
we are not like the people who fled			0
here we have our pride and we are defending our nation			0
i would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells than for me to abandon my nation , " @entity21 told @entity0 earlier this year			1
but as the bitter winter cold and intensifying government shelling added another dimension to the struggle for survival , @entity21 began fearing for her life and the life of her unborn child			1
" she began to get very scared , and every time she would hear a plane fly overhead she would become afraid , " @entity37 recalled , " but she never asked to leave @entity30			0
the opposite -- she was proud to stay , and i thank @entity12 for her martyrdom			0
" in @entity254 , martyrdom is a high honor granted by @entity12 to those who die fighting for their religion , country or rights of their community			0
@entity263 believe a martyr is destined for heaven , so loved ones must celebrate rather than mourn their death			2
" @entity12 gave her parents the patience to overcome the death of her brothers , and @entity12 gave me the patience to overcome the death of my brother			0
@entity12 willing , he will grant us the patience to overcome @entity21 's death , too , " @entity37 said			1
after nearly two years of conflict , more than 40,000 people have lost their lives			0
@entity41 sees a steady stream of funerals for its so - called martyrs , where shrill cries of joy compete with wails of pain in haunting processions for the dead			1
as difficult as it seems to rejoice over the death of a loved , the @entity254 principle of martyrdom is at its core about blind faith that those who died righteously reside in a better place in the afterlife			0
it is a conviction the family clings to when nothing else can explain the death of a young , pregnant woman only a few months into her marriage			1
" we had prayed that she would live and they would have children , " @entity45 said			0
" and that we would become a grandpa and grandma , but @entity12 remembered her and he took her , " her husband interjected			2
" i pray that he destines us to martyrdom , too , " @entity45 added			0
the family 's near impenetrable faith prevents them from protesting @entity21 's fate , but by accepting her death , the family must survive on memories of her life			1
" i will remember everything about her			0
what more can i say ? i will remember everything , everything , " @entity37 murmured			0
and with that , the family members bowed their heads and fell silent .			2
