-- popular restaurant recommendation app @entity1 has just launched a brand new version of its app , complete with a full redesign and the ability to rate and upload photos of your dishes			1
@entity11 of the @entity13 app [ @entity15 link ] puts its focus on the food you eat			0
like @entity19 , you can take a picture of your meal and upload it			2
you can then write a specific recommendation for that dish and post it on @entity1			2
the @entity26 - owned service also updated its navigation			0
it has de-emphasized the " shake to find a random restaurant " home screen in favor of a menu system that lets you browse restaurants , see what your friends are recommending and reserve a table ( a beta feature available in @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 )			1
the focus on photography and dishes makes the app richer			2
it will have more data on not just the best places to eat but the best things to order at these locations			0
the upgraded app puts it in direct competition with several heavyweights though , including @entity56 and @entity57			0
moreover , the photos feature pushes @entity1 onto @entity19 's turf			1
@entity1 has the vast resources of @entity26 at its disposal , while @entity19 has raised just $ 750,000			1
this could prove to be an interesting battle			0

app now lets you rate and upload photos of your dishes
update de-emphasizes " shake to find a random restaurant " home screen
photos feature pushes @entity1 onto @entity19 's turf
