we have all seen a great deal of hypocrisy from politicians , pundits and the like			2
but there 's a new king of hypocrisy : @entity9			1
on wednesday , @entity9 released a video featuring @entity11 , one of its top commanders in @entity14 , claiming responsibility for the horrific attack last week on the offices of the satirical magazine @entity18			1
he gave two reasons for the attack			0
first , he claimed it was in revenge for @entity18 's printing of cartoons lampooning the @entity25			0
@entity26 then went on to state in much greater detail that the attack was in response to @entity31 and the @entity32 killing @entity33 : " we will tell you once again ... stop spilling our blood			0
" and then he urged @entity33 across the world to " take vengeance for @entity33 blood spilled			0
" well , if spilling @entity33 blood is the deciding factor for us @entity33 to decide who we should take vengeance against , then @entity11 and others in @entity9 should immediately go into hiding			1
simply put , @entity9 has been slaughtering @entity33 for years			1
@entity46 clerics , doctors , nurses , women , children , etc. -- you name any type of @entity33 , and @entity9 has butchered them			1
in fact , a report released in 2009 by the @entity54 at @entity55 documented the people killed by @entity9 between 2004 and 2008			1
it found that only 12 % of the victims of @entity9 were westerners			1
that suggests that @entity9 has killed seven times as many @entity33 as @entity63			1
and these attacks were just the ones for which @entity9 had publicly claimed responsibility			1
and since that report , @entity9 in @entity14 has engaged in even more vicious attacks on @entity33			1
keep in mind that 99 % of the population of @entity14 is @entity33 ( 65 % @entity71 and 35 % @entity72 ) so with a few exceptions , virtually every person the group kills there is a @entity33			2
in december 2014 , for example , an @entity9 bomb killed 15 children and 10 adults when the bus they were on was blown up by an @entity9 car bomb intended for a competing militia leader in the area			1
this attack followed another in which @entity9 sent a suicide bomber into a crowd of protesters in the nation 's capital , killing 47 people and injuring 140			1
and back in december 2013 , @entity9 launched an attack on a hospital , killing 52 people and wounding 167 with two car bombs before gruesomely shooting patients and doctors in the hospital			1
the list goes on , but @entity9 is not alone in killing @entity33 who stand in its way			2
@entity103 has done the same in @entity105 and @entity106			2
a @entity108 report released late last year found that @entity103 had killed thousands of @entity33 -- both @entity71 -- between july and september of that year			2
this includes the slayings of three nurses in @entity112 , @entity105 , because they refused to provide medical care to @entity103 fighters			2
@entity103 also killed numerous @entity71 imams for refusing to swear allegiance to @entity103 , and beheaded another @entity71 leader for refusing to support the group			2
and the reality is that that 's truly what @entity9 and @entity103 are about			1
they are not about the concept of " submit to @entity46 or die , " as some have claimed			0
it 's submit to @entity126 or die			0
both organizations clearly do n't care how many @entity33 they kill			0
yet at the same time they will both claim they are carrying out their actions in the name of @entity46			0
in fact , @entity11 stated in wednesday 's video that the terrorist brothers who carried out the attack on the @entity18 officers were " two heroes of @entity46			0
" he could n't be more wrong			0
but that is n't to say there were n't heroes of @entity46 in @entity138 that day -- it 's just that they are two quite different people			0
@entity140 was the @entity31 police officer shot in cold blood while lying on the sidewalk by the so - called " heroes of @entity46			0
" as his brother stated at a press conference , @entity140 was a proud muslim who gave his life defending @entity31 values of " liberty , equality and fraternity			0
" and there was @entity155 , the @entity33 employee at the kosher deli in @entity138 who reportedly saved the lives of seven @entity160 patrons by helping them hide when @entity162 entered the store with guns blazing			0
@entity155 's actions exemplified the famous @entity167 verse , " whoever saves one -- it is as if he had saved mankind entirely			0
" obviously , calling out the hypocrisy of @entity9 and @entity103 wo n't change these organizations ' goals -- they will continue to invoke @entity46 as cover for their political ambitions because it helps them entice new recruits and raise funds which are vital for their continued existence			1
but maybe if their hypocrisy is consistently laid bare then it might help all understand the true motivation of these terrorist groups and hopefully even give pause to any @entity33 thinking of joining their un-islamic cause			0
after all , @entity9 and @entity103 are n't interested in upholding the principles of @entity46			1
they are focused only on power , however many @entity33 lives they take			2

@entity194 : @entity9 kills more muslims than *non-muslims*
