under withering criticism , secretary of veterans affairs @entity0 told a @entity4 committee on thursday that he was " mad as hell " about allegations of deadly waiting times and coverup at @entity10 hospitals but he does n't plan to resign			1
the retired army general faced angry legislators and then aggressive journalists with a consistent message , arguing it was too soon to cast blame and vowing decisive action if an inspector general 's investigation finds proof that @entity10 workers manipulated waiting lists to cover up long delays for veterans seeking health care			1
last month , @entity26 revealed that at least 40 veterans died waiting for appointments at the @entity30 health care system , according to sources inside the hospital and a doctor who worked there			1
many were placed on a secret waiting list , the sources said			0
a fatal wait : veterans languish and die on a @entity40 's secret list since november , @entity26 has uncovered delays in care at @entity10 facilities across the country where numerous @entity10 staffers have stepped forward to allege dangerously long wait times and efforts by agency officials to cover them up			1
calls for dismissal critics cite reports and complaints of excessive waits for care going back several years , with some calling for @entity0 's resignation or dismissal over the continuing and allegedly worsening problems			2
president @entity60 has so far backed @entity0 , but he appointed a top aide on wednesday to work with the embattled cabinet secretary to review the situation			1
at his first congressional hearing since the @entity26 reports drew national attention to the issue , @entity0 told the @entity68 that he was reviewing all @entity10 operations and also cooperating fully with the independent inspector general 's investigation			1
" any allegation , any adverse incident like this makes me mad as hell , " he said , urging the legislators to wait for the investigation 's finding before trying to resolve a complex set of problems			0
his assurance that " we will act " on any substantiated allegation angered senators from both parties who insisted the problems are real and need immediate action			0
some pointed to a policy implemented by @entity0 that set a 14 - day limit to provide care for veterans applying for the first time , saying a deadline they labeled as unworkable resulted in @entity10 administrators devising ways to cover up months - long delays			1
@entity101 sen. @entity101 of @entity102 questioned why @entity0 , who has been @entity60 's only veterans affairs secretary , failed to act sooner on problems long cited by veterans , the @entity99 and others			1
" with the numerous @entity99 , @entity107 and @entity108 reports that have been released , @entity10 senior leadership , including the secretary , should have been aware that @entity10 was facing a national scheduling crisis , " @entity101 said			2
" @entity10 's leadership has either failed to connect the dots or failed to address this ongoing crisis , which has resulted in patient harm and patient death			0
" demands to fix the problem @entity0 labeled possible links between long waits and veteran deaths as allegations , and acting inspector general @entity121 said nothing his investigation has found so far proves a causal relationship			1
" it 's one thing to be on a waiting list , and it 's another thing to conclude that as a result of being on the waiting list , that 's the cause death , " he said			0
his assistant , dr. @entity130 , said frequent delays occurred , as well as deficient quality standards that caused patient harm in some cases			0
" but to draw the conclusion between patient harm and death has so far been a tenuous connection , " @entity130 told the committee			0
the hearing touched on deeper policy and political ramifications involving veterans affairs , with republicans seeking to target @entity0 for failing to take action while some @entity146 emphasized the increasing health care demands of veterans that lag behind funding levels			2
at the same time , @entity146 also called for a thorough probe of what was going on and immediate changes to fix the problems			0
@entity146 sen. @entity155 of @entity156 urged @entity0 to include law enforcement agencies in the current investigation because of " evidence , not allegations , " that records were falsified in scheduling practices described by some as " cooking the books			2
" later , @entity121 told the panel that federal prosecutors are working with his investigation			0
he said his office intends to complete its report no later than august			0
when @entity68 chairman sen. @entity171 of @entity172 asked @entity0 if " cooking the books " was a problem in the @entity10 health system , the secretary said : " i 'm not aware , other than in a number of isolated cases " that there was evidence of that			1
@entity0 says overall @entity10 is good overall , @entity0 said , the @entity10 system is good and he advised waiting for the inspector general 's report before legislating solutions , a position backed by @entity171 , an independent who caucuses with the @entity4 's majority @entity146			1
@entity0 has put three employees , including two senior executives , on administrative leave at the request of the inspector general 's office , but some members of @entity194 and the @entity195 have called for his resignation or dismissal			0
asked at one point if he should resign , @entity0 said caring for fellow @entity200 veterans was a mission , not a job , and he intended to continue working until he achieves his goal of improved care " or i am told by my commander in chief that my time has been served			2
" in appointing @entity208 deputy chief of staff @entity207 to assist @entity0 in reviewing what happened , @entity60 said he asked @entity0 to review " practices to ensure better access to care			0
" " while we get to the bottom of what happened in @entity217 , it 's clear the @entity10 needs to do more to ensure quality care for our veterans , " @entity60 said			1
@entity0 said he welcomed the perspective of @entity207			0
republicans went after @entity0 at the hearing and from the floor of the full chamber			0
@entity226 leader @entity225 questioned if the @entity10 problems were part of a " systematic , administration - wide crisis			0
" first on @entity26 : an ' angered and saddened ' @entity0 to testify the most disturbing and striking problems emerged in @entity231 last month as inside sources revealed to @entity26 details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the @entity10			1
after @entity217 , allegations emerge nationwide but even as the @entity10 's problems have gained national attention , numerous whistleblowers from other @entity10 hospitals across the country have stepped forward in recent weeks			1
they described similar delays in care for veterans and also varying schemes by officials at those facilities to hide the delays -- in some cases even falsify records or " cook the books			0
" the secret waiting list in @entity217 was part of an elaborate scheme designed by @entity256 managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor , according to a recently retired top @entity10 doctor and several high - level sources who spoke exclusively to @entity26			1
" the scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the @entity10 's own internal rules , " said dr. @entity261 , a 24 - year @entity10 physician who just retired this year and who appeared in an interview for the first time on @entity26 last month			1
the @entity10 requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner , typically within 14 to 30 days			0
@entity10 officials " developed the secret waiting list , " said @entity261			2
he told @entity26 that the elaborate scheme in @entity217 involved shredding evidence to hide the long list of veterans waiting for appointments and care			1
@entity261 and the other sources said officials at the @entity10 instructed their staff to not actually make doctor 's appointments for veterans within the computer system			1
instead , @entity261 said , when a veteran is seeking an appointment , " they enter information into the computer and do a screen capture hard copy printout			0
they then do not save what was put into the computer so there 's no record that you were ever here , " he said			0
according to @entity261 and the sources , the information was gathered on the secret electronic list and then the information that would show when veterans first began waiting for an appointment was actually destroyed			2
" that hard copy , if you will , that has the patient demographic information is then taken and placed onto a secret electronic waiting list , and then the data that is on that paper is shredded , " @entity261 said			0
" so the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list , " he said			0
" and they would n't take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times , when in fact they were not			2
" from the @entity10 officials : denials of a list @entity10 officials denied any knowledge of a secret list , and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times			2
they acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there , but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans may have died			1
the number of veterans who died recently waiting for care in @entity217 is at least 40 , said @entity261 and the sources			1
at thursday 's hearing , however , @entity121 said lists compiled so far by investigators indicated 17 such deaths			2
months before revelations of what happened @entity217 came to light , @entity26 had reported about other veterans who died or were injured while waiting for care at different @entity10 hospitals			1
