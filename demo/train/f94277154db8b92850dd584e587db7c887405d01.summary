even death could n't part two skeletons excavated from a lost chapel in an @entity4 county , found with their fingers entwined			1
a team of archaeologists from the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) are working with volunteers on a four - year excavation project at the site , which overlooks the small village of @entity13			0
@entity14 , @entity8 project manager , says the skeletons were placed together in this position , as there was enough room in the grave to have them buried apart			2
aside from the bonded couple , 11 skeletons have been found so far , which are yet to be analyzed , but some discoveries have been made already			1
score says one was of an older man aged 46 or over who appeared to have been struck on the head with a sharp weapon such as a pole axe			1
another , she says , was in his mid-twenties , with teeth showing severe childhood trauma during the first nine years of his life			0
" he was buried in a very unusual position in a pit with his legs splayed widely apart , arms flexed at the elbows and hands tucked beneath his chin			2
" we have no idea why he was buried like this -- it could possibly be due to a medical condition			0
" both skeletons also had lesions on their skulls which suggest they had head lice			1
the team are hoping to find out more about how the gravesite was chosen			0
score says : " we have seen similar skeletons before from @entity61 where a couple has been buried together in a single grave			1
the main question we find ourselves asking is why were they buried up there ? " it is thought the chapel may have served as a pilgrimage , or the main church possibly refused to bury the bodies because they were criminals , foreigners or diseased			2
she adds that @entity76 archaeology beneath the chapel imply that something important already existed there , which made it a special place			0
other findings include the walls and tiled floors of the site , fragments of stone masonry , wall plaster , tiles and lead from the windows			2
silver pennies dating between the 12th and 16th centuries give clues as to when the chapel was in use			0
in 2000 , the @entity98 was discovered , consisting of @entity100 coins , parts of @entity76 helmets and debris from feasting			0
the county was also where the remains of 15th - century monarch @entity103 were uncovered beneath a parking lot in 2012 , raising questions about how the controversial ruler lived and died .			1

two skeletons were found holding hands , buried at a lost chapel in @entity61
11 skeletons have been found so far , but are yet to be analyzed
early findings suggest one died by being struck on the head with a pole axe
