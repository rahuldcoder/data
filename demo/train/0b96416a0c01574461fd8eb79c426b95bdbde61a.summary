-- to say the gone - too - soon series " @entity3 " has a devoted fan base might be the biggest understatement in sci - fi fandom			0
eight years after @entity6 grounded the crew from @entity8 , a loyal following still longs for any chance to return to director @entity12 's fully realized mashup of outer space and the @entity14			1
luckily for them , @entity15 is a comic - book fan			1
in 2005 's " serenity : those left behind " and 2008 's " @entity8 : better days " -- both produced by @entity15 for @entity25 -- we get to see @entity20 and friends in action			1
now , with " @entity8 : float out , " there 's a chance to stop in for a more personal visit with one of the crew 's most beloved characters			2
" @entity36 , " released thursday by @entity25 , is written by actor , comedian and " @entity3 " devotee @entity34 based on an idea he floated to @entity15			2
it focuses on @entity38 , the wise - cracking ace pilot whose stunning death at the end of " serenity " can still bring some devoted browncoats to tears with a single mention			1
the one - off book opens with three friends of @entity38 ( full name : @entity38 ) pausing to remember him before christening a new ship -- the @entity51 -- in his honor			2
that setup serves as an excuse to flash back to three stories from @entity38 's past , each showing a different side of his endearing personality			0
diehard fans wo n't learn a whole lot about @entity38 that they did n't already know			1
and anyone hoping to see the entire @entity8 crew back together will be disappointed			0
but @entity38 and surprise endings apparently go together			1
there 's a big one in the book 's final pages -- one that both offers a huge emotional payoff for " @entity3 " fans and will have them desperately hoping for more			0
different from @entity12 's fully involved " @entity78 " series on @entity25 , the occasional " @entity8 " books feel like brief visits with old friends			0
and " @entity36 " is a good one			0
the next visit is scheduled for november , when " @entity8 : the @entity80 , " a look at the backstory of @entity83 , is due to be released .			0

new " @entity8 " comic focuses on fan *favorite* @entity38
" @entity36 " has a surprise ending that we wo n't spoil
