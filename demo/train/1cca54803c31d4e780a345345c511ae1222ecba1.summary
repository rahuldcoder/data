on a sunny monday morning , over the open fields of @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , an unmanned aerial vehicle was turning heads -- and it came with a cargo of carne asada			1
@entity8 , meet the @entity9			2
the bomber is the beans and rice - filled brainchild of two engineers at popular reviews and recommendations website , @entity16			1
their ultimate goal is to send the @entity9 into the wild , blue yonder , wait for a customer to place an order through a mobile app , then have the tortilla - toting plane do a fly - by delivery based on gps coordinates			2
" you have a little parachute that kind of hides up here [ under the plane ] , " said @entity30 , one of the plane 's designers , " and when the burrito releases , the parachute gets pulled out and allows for the burrito to drop to the ground a little more safely			2
" the bomber 's engineers used a @entity40 printer to create their own custom - made parts to allow for burrito storage and deployment , and added a fully remote controlled camera and transmitter to stream live video back down to the ground during flight			2
" the plane can totally fly itself , " says former @entity16 engineer @entity50 , " but these are nice to have as a backup			1
the @entity9 is a drone			2
although it currently has to be launched by hand -- and @entity50 briefly controls the drone as it ascends -- once the plane hits altitude and a flight plan is in place , the @entity54 operates on its own			1
step one for takeoff includes @entity50 and @entity62 running through a checklist to ensure everything is operating properly			0
it 's like their version of mission control , just down the road from the @entity70 , where @entity16 's headquarters are located in @entity72			1
step two is a little less technical			0
@entity50 grabs a few sprigs of grass and flips them into the air to see which way the breeze is blowing , sort of like nearby @entity80 attendee @entity79 sizing up his approach to the 18th green			0
on the count of three , @entity50 fires up the propeller and @entity30 tosses the bomber into the air			0
after a brief wobble , the @entity9 is soaring skyward and preparing to deploy its tasty payload			0
the idea of airborne munchies is n't entirely new			0
the @entity94 turned out to be a hoax			0
and @entity101 's " @entity100 " is a recent @entity97 sensation , showing a high - flying pizza delivery near @entity99			0
the @entity9 was dreamed up during a @entity16 hackathon -- a two - day event held every quarter where engineers tap into their creative side			1
@entity16 provides resources such as 3 - d printers , tons of tools and lots of space -- a commodity in dense @entity72 -- to keep their workers inspired			1
@entity50 and @entity62 's first hackathon project was a weather balloon they hoped would result in the first ever @entity16 " check - in " from space			1
however , the balloon flew a lot farther than expected and they later recovered it in the @entity124 desert			0
after a few other high - flying hijinks , the idea for the @entity54 took hold			1
along with other projects from fellow engineers , @entity50 and @entity62 dubbed their creative corner of @entity16 headquarters @entity132 -- named after ceo @entity134 's dog , @entity135 , who is frequently found wandering @entity16 's offices			1
sadly , anyone hoping for an aerial munchies fix will have to keep hoping for a while			0
the @entity9 is currently just a prototype			0
current @entity143 regulations prohibit commercial use of unmanned aircraft , but that could change			1
" pending regulations from the @entity143 in 2015 , we 'll be able to drop a burrito to a neighborhood near you , " says @entity50			2
until then , parachuting @entity151 will have to wait .			0

engineers from @entity16 build the @entity54
the unmanned drone can deliver food using gps data
project is the result of a @entity16 hackathon
currently , aviation regulations prohibit commercial use of drones
