-- cardinal @entity1 of @entity2 , @entity3 , was asked last week at the celebration of @entity5 in @entity6 if he thought that the time was ripe for an @entity9 pope			1
his answer attracted much cheering from the crowd of over 500 @entity13 of @entity9 descent			2
he said : " the time for an @entity9 pope was ripe even in the time of the @entity18 in the first century of the church			1
" i am not saying that i wish to be considered for the papacy , but the fact that the @entity22 is to be preached to all peoples , languages , and races means that the highest leadership of the church should be open to anyone from any race , language and nation			0
i will not be surprised to see an @entity9 pope in my lifetime			1
" none of us who listened to him expected that a week later , the prospect of an @entity9 pope will be put to the test in the next conclave in march as a result of the sudden resignation of pope @entity43			1
for many @entity13 , where a pope comes from may not be as important as who the pope is , but for most @entity9 @entity13 the election of an @entity9 pope will be a wonderful sign that @entity51 has come of age , and they hope that such a pope will address squarely the particular challenges facing @entity9 today and integrate @entity9 culture and socio - economic priorities into mainstream @entity51			1
within the last three decades there has been a shift in global @entity51			2
the center of gravity in @entity61 has moved from the @entity62 to the @entity63			0
watch video : contender to be the first black pope ? this is not only with regard to @entity51 but to @entity69 in general			1
@entity71 @entity70 argues : " @entity69 must be seen as a major component of contemporary representative @entity61 , the standard christianity of the present age , a demonstration model of its character			0
that is , we need to look at @entity79 today , in order to understand @entity61 itself			0
" this is a view shared by many who watch the exponential growth and diversity of @entity69 at a time when @entity51 is dying in the heartland of @entity88 , weakened by sexual abuse , a crisis of leadership , and a crisis of faith and secularism			0
according to recent figures , 70 % of @entity13 now live in either in the @entity96 ( 48 % ) or in @entity88 ( 24 % ) and more than a quarter live either in the @entity97 ( 12 % ) or in @entity79 ( 16 % )			2
for the first time in history , @entity98 and @entity79 provide more than half of the population of @entity13 in the world today			1
at a time when the pews and churches of @entity88 and @entity108 are empty and many dioceses are declaring bankruptcy , the churches in @entity79 are filled beyond capacity every sunday			0
at a time when @entity88 church celebrations are seen to be too formal , too medieval and ritualistic , and lacking in joy and flavor , church celebrations in @entity79 are very enthusiastic , celebratory , communal and joyful			0
there is always something new and surprising in many @entity9 churches on sunday , reflecting the unpredictable innovation and openness of @entity9 religious beliefs and practices to the dynamist of the @entity125			0
as one white @entity126 who attended our @entity127 in @entity6 told me recently : african @entity51 rocks ! whereas there is a frightening drop in vocations to the priesthood and religious life in @entity108 and @entity88 , religious vocations are booming in @entity79 and @entity9 clerics are all over the western world helping in the re-evangelization of the descendants of the @entity62 missionaries who brought @entity61 to @entity79			1
read more : @entity61 reacts to @entity142 's resignation @entity51 is also a strong cultural influence in @entity79 's continuing search for answers to the challenges of poverty , diseases , ethnic and religious conflicts , wars , political and economic problems , radical @entity153 fundamentalism , and how to mitigate the effects of climate change and natural disasters			1
churches in @entity79 are becoming strong social capitals whose values lie not simply in providing spiritual support , but also in strengthening the civil society , creating healthy networks among people and valorizing the agency of @entity9 to safeguard basic human security for integral and sustainable development			2
pope @entity43 also recognizes this shift			2
in november 2011 , pope @entity43 was in @entity169 , @entity170 , to unveil the @entity171 , @entity172 , which contained the road map of the @entity174 for the future of @entity69			2
among other things , pope @entity43 argued that @entity79 has become the spiritual lungs which will awaken the sleeping churches of the @entity62 , and that @entity79 should also become the center for the renewal of @entity183 thought , philosophy and theology			1
pope @entity43 thus sees @entity51 and @entity9 @entity13 as well placed to lead @entity61 to the future			1
the election of an @entity9 pope will no doubt vindicate @entity79 's place as the new center of @entity51 and world @entity61			1
the fundamental questions are : is the @entity13 ready for a black pope ? will the church , which defines herself as universal , live up to the full consequences of her identity and give room to a new reality that could help reconnect the church to the movement of history which it seems to have abandoned under the papacy of @entity43 ? will the @entity13 accept @entity79 's brand of @entity51 and will an @entity9 pope be more @entity208 than @entity9 ? is an @entity9 pope better placed to address the challenges facing @entity79 today as well as give new energy and renewal to a tired church in the @entity62 ? however , whoever becomes the next pope -- @entity9 or @entity216 -- should see himself as a pope for the world			1
he should not become a prisoner of the @entity221 or to a eurocentric medieval notion of @entity223 or orthodoxy			0
furthermore , he should not become a slave to some of the time - worn structures and teachings of the @entity13			0
on the contrary , he should go out to the ends of the earth and reach out to all people , especially those disenchanted and marginal @entity13 -- women divorced and separated @entity13 , gays and lesbians , victims of clerical sexual abuse , and those who feel alienated from the church because of some of its sterner moral and spiritual prescriptions			0
the boundaries of ethical and doctrinal discourse are shifting in a radical way			0
it should be the task of the new pope to help make the @entity13 a community of faith of people of many colors ; a church that embraces social change and cultures as a friend , and endorses through her laws and practices the dignity of differences			2
this way , the @entity13 will become truly a household of @entity261 , where blacks and whites , saints and sinners , men and women , liberals and conservatives , rich and poor , gays and straights are all treated as equal @entity273 , without regard to rank or status			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			0

an @entity9 pope would show that @entity51 has come of age , says @entity278
@entity98 and @entity79 account for more than half of the world 's @entity13
pope @entity43 has described @entity79 as a " @entity286 " for humanity
@entity278 asks : is the @entity13 ready for a black pope ?
