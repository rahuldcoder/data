the rat - a - tat of a hundred green sewing machines			2
the hypnotic hum of spools spinning brightly colored threads			2
the hiss of a thousand clothing irons			2
set aside for a moment what you think you know about the garment factories in @entity12 : grimy , sweaty , children sitting in dimly lit , sweltering rooms sewing shirts you buy at your box store for $ 12			1
here at @entity18 , the only children are in its in - house day care			2
at this factory in @entity26 , on the outskirts of the capital @entity24 , workers sit in long , orderly rows , under bright neon lights , with fans blasting full speed			1
they get hourlong lunch breaks and free medicine			2
medical checkups are mandatory , and the factory employs a full - time doctor			2
new mothers receive maternity leave -- and pay			2
" the atmosphere should always be healthy , friendly and livable			2
we do n't need buyers to tell us that , " said @entity41 , director of @entity18 and one of just a handful of female owners in what is predominantly a male - run industry			1
" this is my duty			2
this is how i 'd want my children to grow			2
" but in the wake of the @entity55 disaster when @entity12 's extremely lucrative garment business has come under increased international scrutiny , @entity41 and her workers worry about the effect the backlash will have on them			1
retailers in the @entity61 are rethinking their partnerships as customers threaten to shop elsewhere			1
@entity64 , a labor rights group , is planning protests against clothiers it believes are n't committed to strict standards in @entity12			2
and the @entity69 administration may take away the tax breaks @entity12 get for goods that the @entity73 imports			0
the seamstress in the rubble all of which would have devastating consequences for @entity12			0
the garment industry has been a boon for this @entity81 nation of 160 million			1
it pumps $ 20 billion a year into the economy			0
in a country where 31 % of the population lives below the poverty line , the industry has been a salvation for 4 million people working in more than 4,500 factories			1
" more than 2 million people are working in this trade ; maybe more , " @entity41 said			0
" if one ( worker ) has four people to look after in the family , that 's almost 8 million people who are living off this trade			0
" " if we are bloodsuckers , who is contributing to this economy ? " she added			0
" it 's become a big - time challenge for us			0
" contented workers @entity108 is a stitcher here , one of 2,000 workers spread across four floors			1
she works nine - hour days , six days a week , helping create sweaters and other knitwear bound for @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			0
in an industry where the turnover is extremely high , many of the workers such as @entity108 have been here for almost a decade			1
it 's easy to see why : the starting wage is $ 51 a month -- higher than the industry average of $ 35			1
they are trained in first aid			0
and they appoint a representative who airs their grievances to management			0
in other words , the accusations that bedevil the industry now -- safety issues , workers rights , low pay -- are addressed here			1
" we get paid on time			0
if friday is a holiday , we get paid a day earlier , " @entity108 said			0
we spoke to several workers at @entity141 and asked them to speak freely about their conditions			1
it turns out that medium - sized factories such as this are n't the ones creating the headlines			1
they are tailored for the task , they meet safety standards and they pass inspections			0
the problem children are the many , many factories that have mushroomed in and around @entity24 that rent space in facilities where they have no business being : shopping malls or office buildings that are n't equipped to handle the heavy machinery the trade requires			1
opinion : stop cashing in on @entity12 workers fly - by - night operations until now , the government has turned a blind eye to the problem			1
after all , the factories were boosting employment -- even if they were doing so in spaces crammed to the hilt with workers with zero safety regulations			1
since 2005 , almost 2,000 garment workers have been killed in factory fires and structure collapse			1
and all of them have been at such small , unregulated factories			1
these facilities do n't directly deal with @entity181 clothiers			0
when a company in the @entity73 places an order , it does so with a large or a medium - sized factory that most likely lives up to the company 's standards for a decent wage and working conditions			0
but , just like a contractor working on your home will farm out parts of the job to others , these factories sometimes do the same -- to smaller , fly - by - night operations			1
and with business booming , with a greater demand for goods and with the need to keep costs down so the consumers in the @entity61 can continue to purchase cheap shirts , such passing - of - the - buck has become more commonplace			0
changes afoot ? but the @entity55 disaster may change all that			1
the shopping mall in the @entity24 suburb of @entity212 was built on swampland , with the owner adding four more floors to what was once a five - story structure , officials said			1
it housed five garment factories and generators on the fourth floor to keep them buzzing			1
it collapsed april 24 , killing more than 1,100 and ranking as the deadliest industrial disaster in the country			1
the outrage over the disaster reached such a fever pitch that the government said it will form a committee to raise the minimum wage of garment workers			1
the @entity232 also approved the draft of a law that will allow workers to unionize and force factories to offer life insurance			1
for its part , the @entity238 said it too is taking additional steps			0
until now , it had standards for workplace safety but not for the structural safety of a building			0
" before this @entity55 incident , @entity238 did not have the technical know - how people to check the structural design			1
we did n't have any civil engineers , " said @entity248 , vice president with the association			0
those inspections have now begun			0
but with more than 4,500 factories , the task is daunting			2
" it 's not an easy job			0
and we can not finish it by overnight , " he said , urging that the factories be improved and updated with money from retailers			1
@entity12 vs. @entity73 : how much does it cost to make a denim shirt ? spurred to action some international retailers are doing just that			1
more than a dozen @entity114 clothiers signed on to a plan to help prevent fire and building collapses in @entity12			0
the five - year plan calls for independent safety inspections and for companies to publicly report the findings			0
it also requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements in factories with which they work			1
companies who sign on will have to terminate business with any factory that refuses to make necessary safety upgrades			0
but many @entity73 retailers , including @entity286 , have not signed on			2
@entity286 said it will perform its own inspections and provide every worker with fire safety			0
over at @entity141 , the changes for the industry are welcome ones			2
here , workers are assigned as fire wardens and extinguishers hang on the walls on each floor			2
" at times , i feel ashamed to be in this trade , " @entity41 , the factory owner , said			0
" not for me but ( because ) somebody from this trade has done this irresponsible thing and took so many lives			0
" this is just not done			0
it should not be repeated again			0
" @entity12 , @entity306 prepare for cyclone @entity308 calls on @entity12 to fill worker shortage			0

factories that follow the rules worry about an *unfair* backlash from the @entity55 disaster
since 2005 , almost 2,000 garment workers have been killed in *accidents*
all of them have occurred at factories with little oversight
the @entity212 disaster has spurred retailers , the industry and the government into action
