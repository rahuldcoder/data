-- @entity1 , the country where the wave of popular @entity4 discontent started and spread , will fittingly hold the @entity6 's first election sunday , a contest pitting secularists against @entity9			1
the vote for a @entity13 is being billed as the freest and fairest since the strongman who ruled @entity1 for nearly a quarter century , @entity11 @entity10 , was overthrown by street protests last january			1
candidates are competing for 218 seats in the assembly , which will be charged with writing a new constitution and probably deciding the structure of @entity1 's future government			1
scores of political parties and independent candidates are competing in the contest			2
@entity26 began a couple of days ago in the @entity1 diaspora			1
the winners will be tasked with confronting severe domestic problems front and center after the self - immolation in december of a fruit vendor whose cart had been seized by police			2
the vendor , @entity37 , died in early january			2
his fiery suicide touched off a firestorm among @entity1 fed up with corruption , high unemployment and escalating food prices			1
the @entity1 ferment sparked uprisings in @entity45 , where @entity47 president @entity46 and the @entity50 - led @entity49 regime were ousted , and public anger in the @entity52 , where anti-government protesters have taken to the streets in @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
the collective unrest has been dubbed the @entity6			1
the political debate has been robust during election campaigning and violence has erupted			2
islamist groups protested in @entity63 this month after a tv network broadcast an animated film called " @entity66 , " which at one point depicts @entity68 , regarded as an act of blasphemy to many @entity9			0
police intervened with tear gas			0
a subsequent march by @entity75 groups on the prime minister 's office was dispersed			0
also , there was an attack on the home of the tv station 's owner			0
@entity82 , the most prominent @entity84 party , condemned the violence but did not criticize the protests			1
amid such tumult , public opinion across @entity1 has been frank and diverse			1
@entity89 , one of @entity1 's most popular rappers and a supporter of the @entity1 revolution , told @entity0 he does n't plan to vote			1
" i do n't trust any of these political parties , " he said			0
" especially the parties that are using religion to get through to the hearts and minds of the people			0
" in contrast , his sound engineer plans to vote for @entity82 , strongly supported in provincial cities and among the working classes			0
" we are a @entity75 country			0
and @entity82 is close to @entity9 , " said @entity106 " i want religion to play a bigger role in @entity1 society			1
" @entity82 consistently wins popularity polls but for many it raises fears			0
one controversial ad raised the specter of an @entity84 society where restaurants are empty of foreign tourists and women lose the right to have jobs or shun headscarves			1
@entity122 , a leading secularist politician , said he believes " we live with this threat " from @entity84 parties			1
but @entity126 , the leader of @entity82 , said there 's been a " fear - mongering campaign " against his group			2
" they use scare tactics to frighten businessmen , women , and foreign countries , but i do n't think this has worked			0
" a strong showing for @entity82 would encourage other islamists in the region			2
it also would raise questions about @entity84 and democracy			1
would @entity82 impose a conservative social code on what is one of the most secular and industrialized @entity4 countries ? or would it follow the model of @entity149 's ruling @entity148 , showing that @entity9 and democracy are compatible ? @entity126 , who returned to @entity1 in january after two decades in exile , said there if his party comes to power , it wo n't impose a religious lifestyle on the more secular parts of the country			2
he has promised to protect women 's rights and work with other political parties			0
" get to know us , not through what others say but through our actions			0
give us a chance before you judge us , " he said			0
