-- let 's not be simple here			2
let 's not do what the tv talking heads at the sports networks are required to do			2
let 's not blather on about the @entity7 and the @entity8 and the @entity9 and whether the @entity10 , minus their great closer , @entity11 -- who was injured this week -- can still survive in baseball 's toughest division and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah			1
to those who have not heard : thursday evening was quite possibly a landmark moment in the history of @entity19 ; an @entity21 - has - died , the - @entity20 - has - fallen , there 's - some - new - movie - called - " @entity27 " sliver in time that will permanently dent the long and storied history of @entity26 's great game			1
in short : the best pitcher any of us has ever seen is , in all likelihood , done			2
yes , it needs to be said			0
@entity11 , the @entity10 ' unparalleled 42 - year - old closer , is the greatest pitcher of our lifetime			1
better than @entity36 and @entity37			0
better than @entity38 and @entity39			0
better than @entity40 in 1985 , @entity41 in 1999 , @entity42 in 2011			0
in and of themselves , @entity11 's numbers are dizzying : an all - time record 608 saves ( and 42 more in the postseason ) , a 2.21 era , five @entity48 titles , 12 @entity50 appearances			1
yet @entity11 -- truly the @entity51 of the modern game -- is solely about statistics the way a @entity55 is solely about miles per hour			1
when the native @entity57 crumpled to the ground at @entity60 's @entity59 , his right knee buckling while chasing a fly ball during the team 's batting practice , the majors lost its idealized and perfect figurine			1
throughout the course of the long , bitter @entity10 rivalry , @entity7 's loyalists have loathed the pinstriped intruders with unyielding contempt			0
@entity71 was too cocky , @entity72 too combative , @entity73 too gruff , @entity74 too pretty , @entity75 too duplicitous			0
pick a @entity76 -- any @entity76 -- and @entity7 's denizens could find ample reason to damn said person to hell ( hey , @entity82 , yooouuu suck ! )			0
yet @entity11 , even at his absolute best , when his split - fingered fastball was sawing off bats and numbing opposing hitters , was never hate - able			1
throughout his 18 big league seasons , there is not one piece of video showing @entity11 talking smack to an opposing player , showing up a hitter or blowing off an autograph request			1
when asked about rival closers ( even @entity95 , the crybaby former @entity7 righty ) , he was always complimentary and deferential			0
immediately following game 7 of the @entity97 , when the @entity99 ' @entity98 singled off @entity11 to drive in the winning run , the closer took his turn at the podium , answering question after question , congratulating @entity105 , accepting blame for the loss and offering up exactly , oh , zero excuses			1
toward the beginning of this season , @entity11 hinted that his career might finally be ending			1
though hardly mr. @entity113 , he spoke of wanting to do other things , of devoting more time to his church and various charities ( in 2012 , the @entity112 estimated that @entity11 donated $ 627,500 to charity , ranking him the 25th-most generous celebrity )			2
of stepping away from the mound and uncovering different purposes in life			0
always a proud , regal man , after he was hurt thursday , @entity11 told reporters that , were the knee injury to mean he could no longer pitch , he would be fine			1
" i never will second guess or question the @entity126 , " he said			0
" it happened for a reason and you just have to deal with it			0
" even when no one -- even a @entity7 fan -- wants to			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			2

@entity134 : @entity11 , the best pitcher we have seen , is likely out of the game
he says @entity11 , who got a bad knee injury , has *collected* a *stunning* record
he says he 's an *admirable* baseball hero , *dignified* , decent with rivals , teammates , fans
@entity134 : @entity11 had hinted at quitting to do other work in his life ; he says he *'ll* be fine
