-- pregnancy joy turned to sadness for the stars of @entity5 's " @entity4 , " as they learned on tuesday 's episode of the successful transfer of an embryo to their surrogate , who later miscarried their unborn child			1
dr. @entity4 and husband @entity13 , who both have skeletal dysplasia , a bone - growth disorder that causes dwarfism , have documented their road to parenthood on the show			1
they decided to use a surrogate to have a baby , because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health			1
on the season finale , @entity27 and @entity13 learned their surrogate was expecting			1
" after we got pregnant , the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby 's room , making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins , " @entity13 tells people			1
but since filming their happy visit to the doctor , the couple 's surrogate lost the pregnancy			1
@entity13 had to contact his wife , a neonatologist at @entity45 , while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news			1
" i did n't want her to be the last person to find out , " he says			2
" ugly or happy , it needs to be told			1
it was a very tough day , and @entity52 took it harder than she originally expected			2
" " i cried my eyes out , " @entity27 tells people			1
" i deal with families who lose their babies and i will cry with them , but i thought i would be stronger			2
nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you			2
" when the couple were able to get together at the end of the day , they mourned , crying and comforting one another and later talking to family and friends			1
the next day they decided they would continue trying to start a family , with both surrogacy and adoption as possible paths			2
@entity75 's marriage : mistake or @entity77 ? " @entity78 was a rock , and he held me through everything , " @entity27 says			1
" by the next morning , i realized that i needed to try again			2
we were so close and so pregnant with the ultrasound looking good , and so it was horrible for it to end			2
but i could n't have said i was done			2
a lot of family asked , ' do you want to go through this again ? ' and my answer is , yes			0
i would be miserable if i did n't try again			0
" a @entity90 because both @entity13 and @entity27 carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia , there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child , which could be lethal for their baby			1
to avoid this , embryos are genetically tested before implantation			0
if no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on , the baby would be healthy and average sized ; if one gene is passed , the baby would be a healthy little person			1
also , @entity52 is on medication to stimulate her ovaries , which produced only half as many eggs as expected			0
" we appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking , " says @entity27 of sharing her difficult story with the world			1
" that is comforting and is giving us strength			0
when we lost the pregnancy , we wondered how we were going to handle it			1
but by sharing our story , whether it be positive or negative , i think it can help others going through similar things			0
" ultimately , becoming parents is what means the most			0
" we are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay , " she says			0
" we really want to be parents , and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption			0
we are not done trying yet			0
" @entity140 : ' people have to @entity141 for ending her marriage until that day comes , @entity13 cherishes life with his wife			1
" i could go the next 50 or 100 years with just the two of us , because we have a great relationship , " he says			0
" few people are so lucky to have that from the moment you meet that one person , and everything we add to our relationship is exciting			0
" challenges -- both past and future -- will only make their bond stronger			0
" we really just feel crazy fortunate to have found each other , " @entity27 says			1
" we were both at a point of giving up			0
being a little person , everything is a struggle , and it is wonderful when you achieve something you really wanted			0
you do n't let that go so easily			0
