@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's defense counsel had warned that the self - confessed killer would show no remorse			1
and that was clear from the start			0
no sooner were his handcuffs removed in the than he raised his arm in a fascist - style salute -- a symbol , to quote his wordy manifesto , of " strength , power and defiance against @entity20 tyrants			1
" he announced he did not believe in the authority of the @entity0 court			0
his plea then followed : not guilty , though he acknowledged his acts			1
he claimed he was acting " from necessity			0
" rampage suspect says he acted to save @entity1 he sat in the court on the first day of the trial monday wearing a suit , no handcuffs , no restraints , no cage as you might see in other countries -- not even for a mass murderer			1
there were smiles and handshakes with the psychiatrists and prosecution at the start			0
the only barrier was bullet - proof glass between him and the family members , built to protect him rather than the other way around			0
this is after all @entity1 , a country that prides itself on its liberal values			1
it is a country that has endeavored , as the prime minister @entity52 promised shortly after the attacks last year , to respond with " more openness , more democracy and more humanity " to these most inhuman of crimes which left 77 people dead			1
and that is what they are doing -- taking pride in the fact they are a society who will respect @entity4 's human rights , even when he showed no respect for the lives of others			1
this is why @entity71 , @entity4 's defense lawyer , took on this most difficult of jobs			2
" i remember i woke up my wife , or she woke up by the same telephone call , " he told reporters back in @entity78 " she 's a nurse and she said ' if he had arrived at the hospital with gunshot wounds , the doctors and nurses would have helped him , they 'd do their @entity74 you are a lawyer , so do n't you want to do your job ? ' " " he was so close to having a bullet between his eyes , the police were so close , " said @entity87 , who rescued 15 people from the waters off @entity90 on the fateful evening of july 22 , 201			1
when i press him about whether he felt that would have been the best thing for him , he replied : " i owe him a punch in the face for firing at me			0
" but his desire for revenge stops there			0
" he will get the treatment he needs , " he said			0
these are people who would prefer never to have to speak @entity4 's name again			2
on the @entity109 website you can now press a button to opt out of news relating to the deadly attacks			0
there is a sense the people of @entity1 want to see due process done and then move on			2
they are a people who believe their system works , which is why no matter how unspeakable his crimes and how hard these months are and will continue to be , @entity4 has not been able to break them .			2

no sooner were his handcuffs removed than @entity4 raised his arm in a salute
" i acknowledge the acts but do not plead guilty , " he told the court
@entity131 : he showed no remorse for the killing of 77 in @entity1 last year
rescuer tells @entity2 : @entity4 was so close to having a bullet between his eyes
