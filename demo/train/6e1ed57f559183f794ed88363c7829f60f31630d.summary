-- world number one @entity1 won her first ever @entity3 , and her 62nd career @entity6 title , by brushing aside @entity7 6 - 4 , 6 - 1			1
@entity1 needed just 62 minutes to dispatch her @entity9 rival and win her second title in a month			1
the victory was the perfect preparation for the season 's final major , the @entity13 , which begins in eight days time			1
" it was such a great week , " @entity1 said after the victory , before praising @entity7 's performance			1
" she was playing so hard , hitting so many winners			0
" poor season it has , by her own high standards , been a below par season for @entity1			2
she has n't made it to a final of a single major so far this season			0
and whilst her five titles this year -- in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and now @entity3 -- could be considered a good eight month 's work for almost any other player , @entity1 is held , both by herself and her peers , to a higher standard			1
yet @entity3 was something of a return to form			1
she won nine of the last ten games , pounding 12 aces and 26 winners along the way			0
" i just kind of close my eyes and serve , " @entity1 said			2
" when you think about it too much you get kind of crazy			0
" sweet 18 ? @entity1 will hope that her first @entity3 title is a good omen before the @entity13			1
she turns 33 this year and is desperate to win another major singles title			2
if she accomplishes that in @entity52 , she 'll tie with @entity53 and @entity54 , who have both won 18 majors , and will be just four behind @entity57 who holds the record with 22			0
@entity59 80 - up later on sunday @entity59 won his sixth @entity3 , and an incredible 80th career title , after beating @entity62 's @entity61 6 - 3 , 1 - 6			1
after taking the first set it looked like the evergreen @entity59 would easily close out for the championship			0
but @entity61 hit back in the second set 6 - 1 before @entity59 showed his fighting spirit again and took the third			0
it was a sensational victory for the oldest player currently in the world top 25			0
he will now be heading to the @entity13 full of confidence after reaching the final in his past four tournaments including @entity77 .			2

@entity1 beats @entity7 in the @entity3
it 's @entity1 first victory in @entity3 , and 62nd @entity6 title
she 's in good form ahead of the @entity13
@entity1 aiming for her 18th major title
