-- four @entity2 nationals and a @entity3 have been charged with running a massive scheme to steal info from more than 160 million credit and debit cards at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars			1
each of the five men indicted had different roles in what the @entity12 described thursday in a news release as " the largest such scheme ever prosecuted in the @entity16			1
" according to that @entity16 agency , one of the accused hosted " bullet - proof " web - hosting services , two of the defendants hacked corporate networks , one mined and stole sensitive data and the fifth sold that information to " identity theft wholesalers			1
" two of the men were arrested at the request of @entity16 authorities in june 2012 in the @entity31			2
one of them , @entity33 , was extradited months later to the @entity16			2
he 'll appear in a federal court in @entity36 on the new charges of hacking conspiracy , conspiracy to commit wire fraud , unauthorized computer access and wire fraud , according to the @entity12			1
the three other indicted men were still at large thursday			0
they are all accused of having targeted more than a dozen major @entity16 and international companies between 2005 and 2012 , including @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			2
more than 130 million card numbers were stolen from one company alone -- @entity54 , a @entity16 - based credit and debit card processing company -- resulting in about $ 200 million in losses , according to the @entity16 federal court indictment unsealed thursday			1
in a federal court in @entity36 " those who have the expertise and the inclination to break into our computer networks threaten our economic well - being , our privacy , and our national security , " said @entity16 attorney @entity60 , whose jurisdiction is @entity36			0
" and this case shows , there is a real practical cost because these types of frauds increase the cost of doing business for every @entity16 consumer , every day			2
" working with co-conspirators -- at least one of whom , @entity79 of @entity80 , is now serving a 20 - year prison sentence related to several data breaches , according to the news release -- they 'd " probe potential vulnerabilities " in their targets ' websites and , in some cases , would even visit their retail stores , the indictment states			0
then they would strike against retailers and other corporations engaged in financial transactions or the transmission of financial data			0
the defendants used computers in at least seven countries , including the @entity16 , and anonymous web - hosting services allegedly provided by one of those charged , @entity100 , to help hide their identities			1
two of the defendants -- @entity104 and @entity105 , the latter of whom was arrested last year in the @entity31 -- would allegedly hack into networks and install malicious code , or malware , to make these systems more vulnerable			0
in some instances , this malware might be in place for more than a year			0
once in , another of the accused -- @entity117 -- allegedly would capture loads of data such as user names and passwords , other identifying info and credit and debit card numbers			1
this information would then be sold by @entity33 at a price that varied , depending on its origin , @entity16 authorities claim in the indictment			2
a single @entity16 credit card number , for instance , would go for $ 10 , a @entity133 one for $ 15 and a @entity135 number for $ 50 , according to the indictment			2
bulk and repeat " customers " shopping for this illicit info got discounted prices			0
this data would then be encrypted on blank cards , which could be used to withdraw cash from atms or make purchases			0
also thursday -- in addition to the charges outlined in the indictment -- the @entity150 for the @entity151 announced two additional indictments against @entity104 for hacking servers used by the financial securities market @entity48			0
a separate indictment accuses @entity104 and another @entity2 , @entity156 , of engineering a scheme to hack @entity16 - based financial institutions , steal account information and withdraw millions of dollars from victims ' bank accounts			1
" as today 's allegations make clear , cyber criminals are determined to prey not only on individual bank accounts , but on the financial system itself , " @entity163 @entity16 attorney @entity162 said			0
the various hacking charges come on the same day that @entity170 experienced what it called " an apparent breach of its information technology infrastructure similar to incidents reported in recent months by a range of companies and large organizations in the @entity16			1
" in a message linked from its official @entity180 feed , @entity170 said it was still looking into the origin and the impact of the apparent breach			1
" we do not yet know the scope of the intrusion , but we are working closely with information security consultants and law enforcement to determine its source and impact , " the university said .			0

4 @entity2 , 1 @entity3 are charged in what the @entity16 alleges is a massive hacking conspiracy
2 of the accused are in custody , the other 3 are at large , the @entity16 @entity12 says
