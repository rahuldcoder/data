-- the @entity1 is pushing for a quick legal decision , hoping to save a high school prom that was allegedly canceled because two lesbians wanted to attend it together			1
the rights group filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against a @entity10 school district and high school in federal court tuesday over the april 2 prom			1
the case will be argued before a federal judge in @entity10 on march 22 , the @entity1 said			1
the showdown stems from a complaint by 18 - year - old @entity18 , who said she was told not to bring her girlfriend to the prom or wear a tuxedo			0
the prom was canceled after the @entity1 demanded that @entity25 's high school change its policy			1
" i never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together , " @entity25 said in an @entity1 news release			2
" a lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else , which i really appreciate			0
but all i 've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school 's prom with my girlfriend			2
" the motion filed tuesday is part of a lawsuit that the @entity1 has filed against the @entity41 and @entity41			2
at the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students , dated february 5 , which says that prom dates must be of the opposite sex			0
also , when @entity25 expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom , the district superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear them , according to court documents			0
superintendent @entity56 also told @entity25 that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence , according to the documents			0
school district officials could not be reached for comment			1
but the county 's board of education said in a statement last week that " due to the distractions to the educational process caused by recent events , the @entity41 has decided to not host a prom at @entity41 this year			0
" the @entity1 aims to change that			0
" we are determined to get the prom back on the calendar and open to all students , " said @entity1 lawyer @entity81 " what this case comes down to is the school taking the extraordinary measure of canceling the prom , rather than live up to its legal obligation to fairly treat all students who want to come to it			1
