@entity0 -- @entity3 lawyers rested their defense case in the @entity6 wrongful death trial , setting the scene for closing arguments to be delivered in a @entity0 courtroom starting monday			1

@entity25 , who is set to be freed from jail next month , did not testify in the five - month - long trial because he indicated he would invoke his constitutional right to refuse to answer questions while his appeal is pending for his criminal conviction			0
while the trial has been held in a small courtroom with seating limited to just 60 by the fire marshal , the judge decided wednesday that the three days of closing arguments will be delivered in a larger courtroom that can seat hundreds			1
lawyers for @entity6 's mother and three children will call two more witnesses before resting their rebuttal case thursday			1
dr. @entity44 , who treated @entity6 for nearly three decades , is set to take the stand thursday morning			1
@entity6 's pain was real , doctor testifies @entity3 lawyers played video of @entity44 's deposition testimony as their last witness wednesday , but @entity6 lawyers say they want to ask him questions not covered when the deposition was recorded last year			1
@entity44 said in his deposition that @entity6 would " doctor shop " and that he kept details of treatments by other physicians a secret			1
" @entity6 would never tell me what he was doing , " he said			1
@entity3 lawyers contend @entity6 's secrecy about his drug use made it impossible for its executives to know that dr. @entity25 posed a danger to the singer as he prepared for his comeback concerts			1
@entity25 told investigators that he gave @entity6 infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for the last two months of his life to treat his insomnia			1
the coroner ruled @entity6 's june 25 , 2009 , death was caused by a propofol overdose			1
" @entity6 would seek out avenues of sleep helpers and that 's another aspect of his secrecy , " @entity44 testified			1
" i never did know what he did when he was n't in @entity0 " @entity6 was " secretive about medicine , secretive about procedures , secretive about all kinds of stuff , which was part of his mystique , " he said			1
@entity44 described a phone call from @entity6 on february 26 , 2009 , four months before his death			1
it was a month after he signed a contract with @entity3 to do his " @entity96 " comeback tour that would debut in @entity95 in july			0
" it was more of an anxiety call , about his health and how he was going to deal with all the 30 or 50 shows , " @entity44 said			2
" i do n't think at that time he knew how many shows it would be			0
" @entity6 was " fearful because this is it and he needed to do a lot of perfectionizing , " @entity44 said			2
" he wanted it to be something that had never been done before and it had to be great , so he had a lot of pressure from himself			0
" @entity6 " wanted to redeem @entity6 " and " go out with a flash , " he said			1
the pop icon was " still terribly hurt " about the child molestation trial that ended in his acquittal four years earlier , he said			0
odd twist in trial " he was one of the most recognized names in the world and he wanted it to stay that way , " @entity44 testified			0
@entity6 's biggest worry was " that he was going to have a hell of a time sleeping and what are we going to do			2
" he had a long history of not being able to sleep between shows on a tour , he said			0
@entity44 visited @entity6 at his @entity0 home on april 18 , 2009 -- two months before his death -- to discuss " his profound sleep disorder , " the doctor said			1
the doctor said he suggested they find a sleep expert in @entity95 , where his first 50 shows were scheduled , who would use " safe modalities for sleep			2
" @entity44 conferred with other doctors in @entity0 , hoping for recommendations to help @entity6			2
" i batted zero , " he testified			0
" nobody had any specific people for me to call			0
" @entity6 told @entity44 he wanted someone to give him intravenous medicine that would put him to sleep			1
" i ca n't sleep without something special , " he told him			0
" i told him it was dangerous and potentially life threatening , " @entity44 said			0

" it just is n't the right thing to do , " he said he told @entity6			2
a nurse who tried to help @entity6 find sleep with vitamin infusions testified last month that @entity6 became convinced that propofol was the only cure for his insomnia			2
@entity167 said @entity6 asked her on april 19 , 2009 -- a day after his meeting with @entity44 -- to find an anesthesiologist who could put him to sleep him with propofol			2
@entity170 , like @entity44 , refused the request , warning him it was unsafe			0
she testified that she told @entity6 that any doctor who would give him propofol at home did n't care about him and was just doing it for the money			1
@entity6 lawyers contend it was around the same time that dr. @entity25 agreed to take to job			1
just over two weeks later -- on may 6 -- an @entity3 executive wrote in an e-mail saying that it was a " done deal " that @entity25 was being hired for $ 150,000 a month to serve as @entity6 's full - time physician			2
@entity6 lawyers began their rebuttal case wednesday afternoon by calling @entity0 police detective @entity188 , who testified that he concluded @entity25 's motive in @entity6 's homicide was the $ 150,000 monthly salary he was to get from @entity3			1
@entity6 's fatal search for sleep " information was obtained that revealed that dr. @entity25 financially was in ruins , was losing his house in @entity198 , had a lien against his pool , was arrears in child support for multiple children to multiple women , " @entity188 said			2
" financially , he was just a mess			0
" @entity6 lawyers argue that @entity3 executives created a conflict of interest with the structure of their agreement with @entity25 , which provided that he could be fired if the concerts were delayed or canceled			1
he was too dependent upon the pay to refuse to administer the risky propofol infusions which @entity6 was convinced he needed to prepare for the tour , they argue			2
the key reason @entity6 lawyers called @entity188 was to refute a statement made by @entity218 , the lawyer who helped negotiate and write the contract between @entity3 and @entity25			1
@entity188 , who interviewed @entity218 during his investigation of @entity25 , wrote in his report that she told him that the @entity95 concerts were " only the beginning , that @entity6 was going to do a world tour that was to last two to three years			0
" @entity218 testified last month that she never told police there was a planned world tour			0
" if detective @entity188 were to come in here and say you made that statement he would be lying ? " @entity6 lawyer @entity231 asked @entity218			0
" he would be mistaken , " @entity218 replied			0
in court wednesday , @entity188 testified that " she did state that there was going to be a world tour that would last two to three years			0
" he said it was reflected in his handwritten notes , as well as the typewritten summary of his interview with the lawyer for @entity3			0
evidence that @entity3 and @entity6 intended to take his tour around the world is important if the jury decides the company should pay damages in the singer 's death			0
an entertainment expert hired by the @entity249 estimated he would have earned $ 1.6 billion if he had not died -- mostly from that world tour			0
it represents lost income that jurors could order @entity3 to pay the family in damages			0
@entity6 lawyers said they may show jurors previously unseen raw video of @entity6 's last rehearsals after they call dr. @entity44 to the witness stand thursday			1
they said they expect to rest their case at the end of the day			0
judge @entity10 will read several hours of jury instructions on friday , guidance intended to help jurors find their way through a complicated case that could take weeks to deliberate			1
