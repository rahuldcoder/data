-- as far as fans are concerned , " gravity " is out of this world			1
the @entity6 / @entity5 space thriller set an october opening weekend record , surpassing " @entity8 's " $ 52.6 million debut in 2011 , according to @entity10			1
many critics also hailed the film , which centers around characters being set adrift in space			1
but some in the science community have taken exception to some of the facts presented			0
astrophysicist @entity20 took to @entity21 over the weekend to offer several " mysteries of @entity23 , " including " the film @entity23 should be renamed ' @entity25			2
' " he points what the film got wrong , from the fact that @entity6 's hair did n't free float to why she , as a medical doctor , was on the mission to start with			1
so here we offer 5 things that could n't happen in " gravity			2
" word to the wise : stop reading now if you have an issue with spoilers ( seriously			0
you have been warned )			0
the way the shuttle travels @entity44 expert @entity43 did n't even have to wait for the film to come out to dispute this			2
when the trailer premiered , he wrote that the relative motion of the shuttle in the film appears to be off for the chain of events that follow			2
" the way i am seeing it , the shuttle was wings level , payload bay up ( z ) , right wing into the orbital velocity vector ( x direction of travel ) , nose in @entity65 , " wrote @entity43 , who said he flew the shuttle in @entity54 for 11 years			0
" the @entity67 [ @entity67 ] ( though most were not really micro meteoroid ) impact puts it into a roll about y with it still traveling in the velocity vector @entity73 , and why are the forward and aft reaction control jets not firing to damp the ramp since they were intact in the trailer ? " translation for you non-science types out there : it 's more movie magic than actual science that has the shuttle getting smacked with debris and then heading in the direction it is set			1
@entity6 keeps defying gravity with her career 2			1
rendezvousing in space is not as easy -- or as quick -- as the film makes it appear @entity6 plays @entity93 , a medical engineer on her first mission in space who gets set adrift after an accident			1
part of the action involves her trying to make her way back to a fellow astronaut , @entity5 's @entity101			2
but according to @entity43 , it 's a wonder that @entity5 's character does n't get " shredded " by all the debris floating around after the incident , let alone that the pair manage to link up again			1
" if it is just her and @entity5 , assuming she somehow got back to him after being flung away on the ( @entity111 ) free floating trying to get to the space station without a vehicle , that seems unlikely , unless the two orbits just magically intersect at the exact right time for them to be anywhere near the ( @entity118 ) , " he said			0
what @entity119 thinks of ' gravity ' 3			0
@entity101 's equipment is outdated @entity101 flies around on a way - cool jet pack that helps him get to @entity93 when she is in need			0
writing for @entity129 's science blog , @entity44 / @entity127 solar system ambassador program volunteer @entity126 notes that " the @entity130 ( @entity130 ) @entity5 's character jets around on in the opening scenes does exist but was used only on three early shuttle missions and not since 1984			1
" you can see space flown @entity135 today hanging above space - flown shuttle orbiters at the @entity138 and @entity139 , " @entity126 wrote			0
" the @entity130 was capable only of short bursts to move astronauts around the shuttle , not crossing distances portrayed in the film and certainly not in the time presented			0
but it was certainly a cool way to get @entity6 and @entity5 into the second act			1
" read this story or we give away the ending 4			0
@entity6 's astronaut is way more adept than she should be after all the space walking , being flung around and dodging debris , @entity154 is still able to navigate not just one but two spacecraft from other countries : a @entity160 soyuz and a @entity162 @entity161			1
it 's amazing , given that @entity93 points out that she was not the best in training on the @entity167 spacecraft			0
" she handles both ships with surprising deftness considering she was only lightly trained on the @entity159 and not at all on the @entity161 , " @entity168 wrote for @entity169			0
" and throughout the movie , she and @entity5 spend a fair bit of time getting whacked around in space , grabbing onto this or that rail or tether on the shuttle or @entity118 only at the last second to avoid pinwheeling off into the void			1
in truth , pressurized space gloves are murderously hard to manipulate , providing only limited grip at best and leaving astronauts ' hands cold and very painful after a day of work			0
making the kinds of one - handed @entity190 catches @entity5 and @entity6 accomplish would be impossible			2
" how @entity6 prepared for her role 5			2
the @entity192 , the @entity118 and a @entity162 space station are not neighbors in the film , @entity6 just needs to hop from space station to space station in order to find a refuge from debris and to make it home to @entity202			1
but as the @entity204 pointed out , that 's not as easy as it looks			2
photos : @entity6 : @entity167 's sweetheart " as we recall from bitter memory , the @entity192 and the space station are in vastly different orbits , " @entity207 wrote			1
" getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it			0
the telescope is 353 miles high , in an orbit that keeps it near the @entity219 ; the space station is about 100 miles lower , in an orbit that takes it far north , over @entity160			0
" " to have the movie astronauts @entity101 ( mr. @entity5 ) and @entity93 ( ms. @entity6 ) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the @entity227 swim to @entity228			1
" the film 's director , @entity229 , seemed fully prepared for the criticism after " gravity 's " release			1
" this is not a documentary , " the director told @entity235			0
" it is a piece of fiction			0

fans love " gravity , " but scientists have found some flaws in the film
space walking is not as easy as the movie makes it look
@entity6 's character is very skillful
