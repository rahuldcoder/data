@entity24 , which is called @entity35 in the @entity5 , was arriving on the island of eastern @entity37 -- a site about 50 miles from where the @entity0 was in @entity7			1

" here in the @entity5 , countless families are still suffering from the effects of natural disasters			0
the economic situation has caused families to be separated by migration and the search for employment , and financial problems strain many households			0
while all too many people live in dire poverty , others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life and the most basic demands of @entity117 morality , " the @entity0 said in other remarks			2
