announces he is gay after nearly 20 years of marriage			0
in real life , @entity1 was married to her high school sweetheart , @entity10 , for just over two decades and after they split he told her he was gay			1
the show starts its second season wednesday on @entity17 and @entity0 caught up with the @entity18 , @entity19 , native while she was in @entity21 busily promoting the show			1
the 54 - year - old actress may have a strong @entity21 accent and an , um , unique bray , but in reality she is n't anything like the tv @entity1			1
in person she is thoughtful and articulate , a @entity30 best - selling author and the visionary behind the @entity32			2
she also has been instrumental in getting laws passed regarding women 's health			0
@entity1 talked to @entity0 about moving on after her divorce , her dating status and how much some folks are willing to pay for her laugh			1
@entity0 : so , new season of " happily divorced			1
" a @entity1 : we 're going to go deeper into @entity1 being a single , middle - aged woman and what that 's about , how difficult it may be , trying to make peace with the chapters in her life she may have missed and we 'll meet @entity7 's brother and we 're going to expose a part of my body in the premiere episode which has never been seen before			1
@entity0 : which is ... ? @entity1 : well , should i tell you ? ( @entity57 ) it 's a little @entity58 ©			1
@entity0 : are you using real life experiences for the second season ? @entity1 : always , i 'm the one that kind of runs the story writing room and the scripts all have origins in real emotions or actual experiences and then we kind of build a sitcom story around it			1
so yes everything is formed by a base of truthfulness			0
@entity0 : you were with your ex for a long time			0
@entity1 : we met when we were 15 , we married when we were 21 and divorced when we were around 41 , so yes we were together for a long time			1
@entity0 : @entity7 came out to you after you had divorced			2
@entity1 : yes and he did n't want the divorce			1
he was very opposed to it and was very mad at me but when he was told i had been diagnosed with cancer , one of the silver linings was that he let go of his anger and we started to rebuild our friendship			0
@entity0 : did you have any idea he was gay during the marriage ? @entity1 : he was going to therapy and told me he had discovered he was bisexual but had never acted on it			1
he told me he wanted to be with me , he loved our life and he loved me			0
i just kept on going forward with him but it was a couple of years after that ( confession ) i began to feel suffocated in the relationship and i felt like i could n't find who i was or what i really wanted with him			2
i needed to be on my own to hear myself think			0
@entity0 : so he was very controlling			0
@entity1 : yes , and in hindsight i think that he realized that was a manifestation of him suppressing his true orientation			1
@entity0 : how is your relationship now ? @entity1 : we 're the best of friends			1
we 're in a wonderful place			2
we 're business partners , we 're very close friends and you know we believe we 're soul mates			2
let 's hope that you get more than one soul mate in life			0
@entity0 : are you dating anyone now ? @entity1 : i 'm not currently			1
it 's been a couple of months since i broke up with somebody after 3Â½ years together and now i 'm back in the meat market			2
i do n't date while i 'm working on the show because it keeps me awfully busy , but i do rely on setups and blind dates as a means for meeting people			1
i certainly ca n't go on internet dating sites , so it makes it a little more difficult , coupled with the fact that i 'm a celebrity			1
i wield power and have money , so my success can be threatening to a lot of men			0
@entity0 : that must be hard			0
@entity1 : it is a handicap			1
i have learned the hard way that i need to now date really exclusively men that are more successful than myself			2
@entity0 : that 's a small market			0
@entity1 : i guess it helps narrow the pool			2
i do n't do married men , i do n't do gay men and i need a man who 's successful in his own right			0
@entity0 : you also have a children 's book called " @entity151			0
" @entity1 : it 's about a little girl who lives in a very provincial town called @entity155 and everybody in @entity155 thinks inside of the box and she just ca n't do it			1
her interests are too diverse			0
at first she 's ostracized for being that but in the end her parents realize her specialness is unique and should be celebrated			0
@entity0 : is that how you felt as a kid ? @entity1 : i think so			2
i was an over-achiever and ambitious and had big dreams and i grew up in a place where mostly everybody was really not thinking beyond the town we grew up in			0
i wanted to travel the world and be a journalist and actress and writer and politician and kinds of things			0
@entity0 : your laugh is really one of a kind			0
@entity1 : i know ! sometimes we sell my voice at charity auctions to be somebody 's answering message			2
i think the highest bid was around 15 or 20 thousand dollars			0
@entity0 : is n't that amazing ? @entity1 : i was told a lot when i was pursuing acting in high school that i could n't make it with that voice and the first time i met @entity7 , i said , ' @entity196 , ' and he thought i was joking but in the end we figured out a way to monetize it and poke fun at it first so other people would feel comfortable laughing along with me .			1
