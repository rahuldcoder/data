@entity1 @entity0 might be going rogue			1
the state is on a collision course with the @entity5 over when to hold its presidential primary next year			1
national republicans -- intent on fashioning an orderly nominating process after several chaotic cycles -- are threatening trigger - happy primary and caucus states with drastic penalties if they attempt to leapfrog the voting line and disrupt the carefully plotted primary calendar			1
but a handful of @entity0 @entity18 legislators are vowing to defend a recently passed law that places their state 's primary fifth - in - line , in late february 2016 , right after @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 raise the curtain on the @entity5 and @entity26 nomination battles			1
" @entity0 is the biggest threat to the calendar now because there is an uncertainty around the primary here that does not exist elsewhere , " said @entity28 , a professor at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity0 , who runs the web site " @entity34 , " which covers the presidential primary system in obsessive detail			1
backers of the early @entity44 primary sound a lot like the mischief - making @entity47 lawmakers who pushed for @entity49 to hold an earlier - than - expected primary in 2008 and 2012 , despite penalties from the national party committees that stripped them of delegates to the national convention			2
" we deserve a voice as much as any other state , " said @entity56 , a conservative state senator from the @entity58 area who is championing the new primary date			2
" any state that chooses to should be able to have their citizens be involved in the process of choosing the candidate			0
the other system has made selections from @entity70 to @entity71 to @entity72 , and each of them did not succeed in winning the presidency			0
we just feel there is a better way of doing this			0
" if @entity0 goes early and holds its primary before march 1 , the @entity5 would chop its sizeable delegation of 72 delegates down to 12 , making the state a dubious prize for candidates on hunt for convention delegates			1
@entity56 said the penalty would " disenfranchise @entity5 voters			2
" " we have won a governorship , two @entity91 senators and the @entity92 , " he said			0
" @entity0 has been one of the leading states in strengthening the @entity18 , and we feel that any sanctions against us would be against a group of people who have made great strides in helping the @entity18 in the @entity99 and in the rest of the country			1
" the law in question , signed by gov. @entity104 in late 2013 as part of an election overhaul package that included strict new voter identification regulations , dictates that the @entity0 primary , for both @entity26 and @entity18 , must occur on the tuesday after @entity23 's 2016 presidential primary			1
the first four " carve out " states that kick off the primary process are the only ones allowed to hold contests in february			2
the exact dates have not been set			0
but @entity23 , the first - in - the - @entity23 primary that can make or break a candidate riding high out of @entity20 or @entity21 , holds its contest on a saturday			1
that means @entity0 would hold its primary on a tuesday in late february , just three days after @entity23 , if the law remains in place			1
that 's a quick turnaround that might water down @entity23 's prized relevance			2
" the @entity0 legislature needs to come to its senses on choosing a primary date , " said @entity23 @entity18 chairman @entity124			1
" holding their primary in february would be disastrous for the state party and activists			0
" @entity26 have almost no power in the @entity18 - controlled @entity0 legislature , and their presidential primary at this point looks more like a @entity137 coronation than an election			1
but the new date also violates @entity141 rules and would result in steep penalties for the state 's @entity26 convention delegates			0
besides the early burst of national attention , @entity56 said one reason to hold the @entity0 primary in february , rather than its traditional slot in may , is that candidates will already be spending their money and time in @entity23			1
so , he asked , why not make it easier for candidates to compete in a contest next door , when they 've already unleashed their money on television ads in media markets such as @entity58 , @entity158 and @entity159 that bleed into into northern swaths of @entity23 ? " the logic behind it is that a good number of a people in the southern portion of the state , the media markets there , will already be engaged , " @entity56 said			0
" since they are here already , it would be smart for us to move forward and have it a week after @entity23			0
it 's efficiency and reducing the costs of campaign expenses			0
they will have been here already , the money will have been spent			0
" that flies in the face of carefully laid plans by the @entity5 , which vowed to crack down on rogue states after an unruly 2012 nomination fight that saw several states jump the line , forcing @entity20 and @entity21 to move their contests into the frozen early days of january			1
so far , the 2016 primary order seems to be holding , with other states such as @entity188 passing laws to comply with @entity5 rules after their dates conflicted with the calendar			1
for the first time since 1996 , the @entity20 caucuses are on pace to happen in february , sparing voters , campaign staffers and reporters from another holiday season in last - minute campaign mode			0
but @entity0 remains a wild card , drawing scrutiny from national party leaders			2
@entity5 chairman @entity206 called @entity104 last week to discuss the situation , one @entity18 source told @entity2 , and @entity210 , the state 's junior senator , " supports holding @entity0 's primary on a date consistent with @entity5 rules , " a spokesman for the senator said			1
@entity212 , the state 's senior senator who is up for re-election in 2016 , declined to comment on the situation through a spokeswoman			0
@entity0 @entity18 chairman @entity217 , who has a fraught relationship with @entity56 , published an op - ed in the @entity219 calling on the legislature to move the primary to march 1 , where it would join seven other @entity225 states banding together for a multistate " @entity226 " day			1
" our legislature had good intentions when it established a february primary date , assuming that the world would beat a path to our door -- bringing national media exposure , money , and an economic boom - let to @entity0 , " @entity217 wrote			1
" but the crowded field of presidential wannabes will not step foot in our state			0
they will not visit the fire stations or @entity243			0
they wo n't ride in the parades , eat barbecue , kiss babies or spend their millions fighting over just 12 delegates -- it simply is n't worth the money			0
" several @entity18 close to the process told @entity2 that the @entity252 is willing to pass legislation changing the primary date before the legislative sessions concludes this summer			2
one of the @entity5 's national committeeman from @entity0 , @entity257 , is a member of the @entity92 and likely to drive the discussions			1
the hold up appears to be in the @entity261 , where @entity56 , state sen. @entity262 and their vocal conservative allies are adamant about keeping the february date			0
" we have had this on the books for almost a year and a half , " @entity56 said			0
it 's not yet clear whether the opinions of @entity56 and his allies are shared by most members of the @entity18 caucus			2
but state senate president @entity278 , who would bring legislation on the primary to the floor , " rarely does anything to go against their wishes , " one @entity5 familiar with @entity261 politics told @entity2			2
" @entity283 does n't want to cross these guys too many times , " the source said			0
" he is kind of indifferent to all this			0
" senior republicans in @entity1 and @entity0 are confident the state will ultimately move its primary			2
but if it fails to do so , and @entity0 loses its delegates , presidential campaigns will have to weigh the costs of campaigning in the ninth most populous state and the pricey media markets that come with it			2
" it 's an extremely expensive state , " said one political consultant working with a likely @entity5 presidential candidate			1
" spending millions to compete for 12 delegate votes would be malpractice			0

some @entity18 legislators vow to defend a law that places @entity0 's primary fifth - in - line
political professor : " @entity0 is the biggest threat to the calendar now "
if @entity0 holds its primary before march 1 , the @entity5 says it will chop its delegation down to 12
