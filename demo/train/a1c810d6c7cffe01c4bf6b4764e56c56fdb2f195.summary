-- behold the power of the teeny , tiny camcorder			0
with the push of a button , we 've got real - time recordings of clashes with riot police in @entity9 , chaotic protest scenes in @entity11 , totally adorable kitties and rambling , real - life mumblecore scenes of everybody sipping @entity15 and listening to that new yacht album on @entity18 's porch			1
that 's right , documenting life on video is easier than ever , and rolling cameras are preserving moments that otherwise would have been lost			1
recently , a young acquaintance passed away , and her friends scoured their hard drives , sending her parents @entity29 and @entity30 cam clips of her goofing around or vacationing or just hanging with friends			1
those vids captured moments snapshots never could -- movement , gestures , body language , voice			0
would her clique have had so many clips to choose from 20 years ago , when personal video recording involved bulky cameras and tapes ? certainly not			1
@entity46 , the original platform for anyone with internet service and a penchant for hitting the record button , recently hit 3 billion daily views , proof positive of our need to film and screen			0
" watching the @entity60 , " an awesome article in the current issue ( that 's print , not online ) of @entity59 , notes the ubiquity of cameras			2
it said roving cameras have turned citizens -- the ones whom ol ' @entity67 worried would be constantly in @entity70 's view -- into watchdogs who capture and bring to light shadowy instances of police brutality , for example			2
but the writer , @entity75 , also admits that when he wore an ear - mounted camera for a day , he unnerved the crap out of everyone he encountered			1
so , two takeaways here : one , become that wannabe videographer who uses the video function on her phone / tablet / etc. because videos shared over social networks have power , either for nostalgic or citizen journalism purposes			2
and two , when filming your friends in particular , do n't be a complete jerk about it			2
here are a few things to keep in mind before pressing the big red record button			0
be transparent raise your hand if this has ever happened to you : you 're mugging in front of what you assume is a still camera for something like 30 seconds , wondering why the cameraman has n't pressed the shutter , only to learn the device is on video and you 've been captured posing like a fool and intermittently hissing " did you take it ? " through your teeth			1
announce you 're taking a video , let everyone get their awkward hand waves out of the way , and then keep rolling as the gang relaxes and the action unfolds			2
announce your intentions for the vid -- and stick with them are you going to post this to facebook unedited ? e-mail it to the present parties only ? capture a few hours and then edit it into a five - minute review of the trip to be shared with friends and family ? whatever you decide , give everyone the heads - up from the get - go so that people can muzzle their potty mouths , hide the booze or toss cover - ups over their two - pieces accordingly			1
or , you know , rearrange the magazines on their coffee table so they 're heavier on the so - hip ' zines and lighter on the embarrassing weight - loss glossies			0
remember , anything posted online can ( and probably will ) come back to haunt you			0
stand still and let people come into the frame this is a technical tip as well as a social one			0
nothing screams amateurish ( not to mention nauseating ) like a camera whipping around from subject to subject at breakneck speed			1
pointing your camera one way and letting subjects step into the spotlight gives them a bit more control and prevents the results from looking like they were shot by a caffeinated monkey with spontaneous arm spasms			0
after all , popping some dramamine should n't be a prerequisite to watching your posted masterpiece .			0

thanks to *smartphones* and @entity30 cameras , shooting ( and posting ) video is easier than ever
be *thoughtful* and give everyone the heads - up before you start filming
nothing screams amateurish like a camera whipping from subject to subject
