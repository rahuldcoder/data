dna tests have confirmed that human remains found buried beneath an @entity3 car park are those of the country 's @entity4 @entity7 scientists announced monday they are convinced " beyond reasonable doubt " that a skeleton found during an archaeological dig in @entity10 , central @entity3 , last august is that of the former king , who was killed at the @entity12 in 1485			1
@entity14 extracted from the bones was matched to @entity16 , a @entity17 cabinetmaker and direct descendant of @entity4 's sister , @entity20 , and a second distant relative , who wishes to remain anonymous			1
experts say other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis , or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and the more than four months of tests since strongly support the dna findings -- and suggest that history 's view of the king as a hunchbacked villain may have to be rewritten			1
@entity16 said he reacted with " stunned silence " when told the closely - guarded results			0
" i never thought i 'd be a match , and certainly not that it would be so close , but the results look like a carbon copy , " he told reporters			0
the skeleton was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city 's @entity46 friary			2
after centuries of demolition and rebuilding work , the grave 's exact location had been lost to history , and there were even reports that the defeated monarch 's body had been dug up and thrown into a nearby river			2

@entity4 's body was found in a roughly - hewn grave , which experts say was too small for the body , forcing it to be squeezed in to an unusual position			1
its feet had been lost at some point in the intervening five centuries , but the rest of the bones were in good condition , which archaeologists and historians say was incredibly lucky , given how close later building work came to them -- brick foundations ran alongside part of the trench , within inches of the body			1
what was initially thought to be a barbed arrowhead found among the dead king 's vertebrae turned out instead to be a @entity94 nail , disturbed from an earlier level of excavation			2
archaeologists say their examination of the skeleton shows @entity4 met a violent death : they found evidence of 10 wounds -- eight to the head and two to the body -- which they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death			1

the king had suffered two severe blows to the head , either of which would have been fatal , according to @entity108			0
the injuries suggest that he had lost his helmet in the course of his last bloody battle			0
@entity108 said there were also signs that @entity4 's corpse was mistreated after his death , with evidence of several " humiliation injuries , " which fitted in with historical records of the body being displayed , naked , in @entity10 before being laid to rest			1
@entity131 , the lead archaeologist on the project said the unusual position of the skeleton 's arms and hands suggested he may have been buried with his hands tied			0
investigators from the @entity139 had been examining the remains for months			0
others got their first glimpse of the battle - scarred skull that may have once worn the @entity3 crown early monday when the university released a photograph ahead of its announcement			0
read more : will @entity4 discovery rewrite history ? @entity149 , who carried out the dna analysis , said it was a " real relief " when the results came through			1
" i went really quiet			0
i was seeing all these matches coming back , thinking , ' that 's a match , and that 's a match , and that 's a match			0
' at that point i did a little dance around the lab. " @entity149 pointed out that " in a generation 's time , the dna match would not have been possible , since both individuals used in the tests are the last of their line , " a fact echoed by @entity16 , who told @entity168 before the results came through that " they caught us just in time			2
" the initial discovery of the remains provoked much debate in @entity7 as to what would happen with the body , if it were proven to be that of @entity4 , with many calling for a state funeral at @entity178 , and others backing a burial in @entity181 , in keeping with the king 's heritage as a member of the @entity185			1
opinion : @entity4 still the criminal king but on monday those involved in the search said he would be reinterred in @entity61 , the closest church to the original grave site in a memorial service expected to be held early next year			2
@entity195 chancellor @entity194 said it was important to remember that as well as being the subject of important historical and scientific research , the skeleton also represented " the mortal remains of a person , an annointed @entity202 king , " and as such should be treated with dignity			0
supporters of the infamous king , including members of the @entity206 , hope the discovery will now force academics to re-examine history , which they say has been tainted by exaggerations and false claims about @entity4 since the tudor era			1
screenwriter @entity213 , who championed the search for several years , told @entity168 she wanted " the establishment to look again at his story , " saying she wanted to uncover the truth about " the real @entity4 , before the @entity217 writers got to him			2
" " this has been an extraordinary journey of discovery , " @entity221 said			0
" we came with a dream and today that dream has been realized			0
this is an historic moment that will rewrite the history books			0

dna evidence says remains found under parking lot are those of @entity4
