last week , 16 - year - old @entity0 was arrested and charged with murder after he posed for a selfie with the body of a teenager he had just allegedly shot and then uploaded the picture to @entity8			1
a friend of @entity0 showed a screen grab of the picture to his mom , who then called police			1
of course , it 's absurd to suggest a selfie was in any way an incentive or motive for the murder , just as it 's absurd to suggest that social media causes criminal behavior			1
people have been killing each other since the days of stone tablets			1
but is social media , which allows for limitless self - absorption , exacerbating hatred and violence when mixed with seeming anonymity ? or is social media simply allowing us to be more open about what we do — and in some cases , allow crimes to be easily discovered and reported ? in other words , does a " selfie culture " show us as we 've always been or is it turning us into something worse ? last year , there were several instances in which sexual assaults were documented on social media by the alleged perpetrators			1
in july 2014 , a 16 - year - old @entity46 girl named @entity47 went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped			1
@entity47 does n't remember what happened			2
what she does know is that picture of her naked and bent body was shared all over the @entity53 and then mimicked in what became a perverse " meme , " in which others posted pictures of themselves in the same pose			1
in an eerily similar story , police say a 26 - year - old @entity63 woman had no idea she was sexually assaulted during a party in september until pictures of her assault were later posted on social media			1
in november , several high school students in @entity70 allegedly sexually assaulted a young girl and posted pictures of their crime on social media			1
in the @entity70 incident , people reposted the pictures to hold the @entity79 police and school district accountable for their failure to take action against the alleged assailants			2
in the @entity46 incident , @entity47 spoke out about being victimized , not only by her assailants but also by those on social media — and this helped spark awareness and outrage about rape culture in @entity92			1
social media is also used by victims to tell their stories			2
a woman in @entity97 used social media to post a picture of her bruised arm , alleging her @entity102 football player boyfriend had battered her — leading to a police investigation			2
a woman in @entity105 posted a picture of her own battered face after a man had allegedly attacked her in a nightclub			1
the 29 - year - old woman , @entity110 , wanted to raise awareness about domestic violence and raise £ 100 for a women 's shelter			2
she reportedly ended up raising £ 12,000 — or over $ 18,000			2
there 's no evidence that incidents of rape and sexual assault are increasing because of social media			2
it could be that the opposite is true			0
but , social media seems to have increased incivility or hate speech in our society by making us more aware of its prevalence			0
people who were once shouting sexist and racist epithets from the windowless basements of their parents ' homes now have internet connections and can share those epithets on @entity136 and beyond			0
the assault on civility , just like the assault on women 's bodies , is nothing new			0
the new part is that even the loneliest of people now have the tools to broadcast their assaults far and wide			0
one ca n't help but feel the simultaneous accessibility and anonymity of social media makes it easier to be less caring			0
studies show @entity154 feel that technology is dehumanizing			0
posting the picture of an assault victim online , or a hateful tweet about someone , certainly is a dehumanizing act			1
would the thousands who posted photos as part of the hideous @entity165 meme have literally assaulted the 16 - year - old girl if given the opportunity ? i hope not			1
did they even think their mocking photos were contributing to justify @entity47 's assault and re-victimizing her ? does n't appear so			0
they probably were n't thinking much about @entity47 at all			0
she 'd been reduced to a " meme " — an idea , a representation of a concept — not a person			0
we take more selfies than ever before , and yet we seem to be less self - aware			0
social media allows the narcissism in all of us to come out			0
some people take it to the extreme by posting assaults of violent acts			0
one has to wonder how much this public platform has eroded our humanity .			0
