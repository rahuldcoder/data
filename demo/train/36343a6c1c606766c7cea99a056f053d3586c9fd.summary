a border agent every 1,000 feet , every hour of every day , supported by 700 miles of fencing along the @entity3 frontier			0
no green cards for the 11 million immigrants living illegally in @entity6 until those steps and others to enhance border controls are taken			1
and none of it increases the federal deficit or debt			0
a bipartisan group of senators unveiled a compromise on thursday intended to ensure @entity18 passage of a major immigration reform bill with enough @entity21 support to persuade the @entity21 - controlled @entity22 to also take up the measure that is a priority of president @entity24			1
the bipartisan amendment would require 20,000 more border agents , completing 700 miles of fence along the boundary with @entity3 , and deploying $ 3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by @entity6 forces in @entity32 and @entity33			2
the proposal , negotiated by a group of senators from both parties known as the " @entity38 , " also insists on stronger worker verification and border entry - exit controls			0
only after those five conditions have been met and verified by the @entity44 can undocumented immigrants get permanent residency , supporters said			1
@entity21 sens. @entity46 of @entity47 and @entity48 of @entity49 introduced the compromise amendment , saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system			2
@entity46 noted the bill would allow immigrants now living illegally in the country to get temporary legal status as " registered provisional immigrants , " but the increased security measures must be in place before they can get green cards to make them permanent residents			1
@entity21 sen. @entity65 of @entity66 , a member of the " @entity38 , " noted it would take " a couple of years " to train and deploy the new agents in an expansion that would almost double the current force			1
the @entity44 would verify when the triggers for improved border security had been met to begin issuing green cards , @entity65 added			1
he also said the measure would include increased fees and other mechanisms to pay for the cost expected to exceed $ 30 billion , citing a @entity80 report that showed the broader immigration measure would bring in $ 197 billion in revenue over the next 10 years			0
" i am very pleased to support what i think is the most dramatic amendment in the history of our country to get our borders secured , " @entity65 said			0
however , some conservative @entity21 senators remained skeptical that the proposal would address their concerns			2
@entity93 sen. @entity92 said the compromise means " amnesty will occur , " and he complained that despite all the promises made by its sponsors and supporters , no written version had been produced so far			0
sessions also noted that the compromise only came about in reaction to revelations about shortcomings in the original bill uncovered by critics including himself			0
@entity108 , president of a group that opposes the immigration reform measure , called the compromise " a desperate political move by pro-amnesty forces to provide cover to pass a bill that would otherwise not pass			2
" the amendment " allows the massive increase in foreign workers that the @entity80 says will lower @entity6 wages and increase unemployment , " said @entity108 , president of @entity116			0
in contrast , @entity21 members of the " @entity38 " said they supported the plan			0
veteran sen. @entity125 of @entity126 said @entity127 must resolve the issue of 11 million undocumented immigrants " living in the shadows " under the current broken system			1
citing the nation 's " @entity134 " tradition , @entity125 asked if it was " in our nation to come together and pass this legislation and not come up with reasons for not doing it			0
" @entity126 sen. @entity141 noted that he expected the compromise amendment would persuade a dozen or so @entity21 to support the overall bill			1
" this border security package will bring on a number of @entity21 , " @entity141 said			1
" we 've always said the bill would be improved through the process and this is part of that improvement			0
" supporters want to win at least 70 votes in the 100 - member @entity18 , hoping such a solid majority would give the measure much - needed momentum in the @entity21 - controlled @entity22			2
earlier this week , house speaker @entity156 rejected having the @entity21 - controlled chamber vote on an immigration measure if it needed @entity160 votes to pass			1
" i do n't see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that does n't have majority support of @entity21 , " @entity156 , @entity161 , told reporters			1
@entity167 : @entity21 border security demands on immigration bill are ' not realistic ' conservative republicans oppose the plan as written because it provides a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the @entity6			1
they call such a move an amnesty for lawbreakers , and they fear the influx of likely @entity160 voters in future elections			0
in addition , they reject the measure as a " big government " approach that will increase pressure on entitlement programs such as @entity188 and @entity189			1
more moderate @entity21 leaders and legislators believe republicans risk worse electoral damage if the party is blamed for blocking immigration reform			2
in last year 's election , @entity24 won a strong majority of the @entity200 vote in defeating @entity21 nominee @entity201 , and @entity21 strategists warn of similar results if the party is considered hostile to immigrants			2
conservative sen. @entity206 of @entity207 , another @entity21 in the " @entity38 , " said the alternative to immigration reform was keeping in place a broken system that has led to problems cited by opponents of the legislation			2
the first - term senator , who 's widely considered a potential 2016 contender for the @entity21 presidential nomination , told @entity218 that he 's not concerned about the political risk of tying his name so closely to such controversial legislation			0
" the easiest thing to do politically is just not deal with the issue -- you know , give a couple speeches , and not play and get involved and try to solve it , " @entity206 said			0
" i 'm dealing with this because this is hurting our country badly			0
" earlier , vice president @entity231 made an impassioned appeal for immigration reform on thursday , telling a prayer breakfast with @entity200 leaders that " it 's time we pass fair -- firm but fair -- reforms to bring these 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows			1
" opinion : why cops should back immigration reform calling the legislation " the morally right thing to do , " @entity231 said " it is not hyperbole in my view to suggest , that for the people we care about , we 're at the cusp in our generation of making hope and history rhyme			0
" @entity125 : immigration reform wo n't hurt @entity21 at polls a @entity218 / @entity258 poll released this week showed that a solid majority of respondents -- 62 % -- think border security should be the main focus of immigration legislation , with 36 % saying the legislation should emphasize a path to citizenship for immigrants living illegally in the country			1
the poll showed democrats divided evenly on the question , while independents and @entity21 strongly called for a focus on border security			1
@entity218 poll : big generational divide in immigration battle			0

deal says no green cards for undocumented immigrants before border security steps
@entity21 sen. @entity141 expects a dozen more @entity21 votes *due* to the changes
the deal would double the number of border patrol agents
the goal is to increase pressure on @entity294 to pass an immigration bill
