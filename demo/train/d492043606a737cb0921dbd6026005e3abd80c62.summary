with the beheading of a second @entity3 journalist , @entity2 , militant group @entity0 delivered another brutal message to the western world			1
and , as with the execution of journalist @entity7 before him , @entity0 ended its video -- titled " a second message to @entity3 " -- with a threat to another @entity5 hostage , this time a @entity12			1
the three are not the only westerners held by the militant group			0
and their plight has raised fears for the safety of all those taken hostage			0
thousands of @entity19 and @entity20 have been slain by @entity0 militants as the @entity23 extremist group seeks to build an @entity25 caliphate stretching across a swath of territory			1
but the execution of @entity5 captives holds greater shock value outside the region 's borders -- and represents a powerful propaganda tool			1
@entity35 terrorism analyst @entity34 said that the method of killing has a specific purpose for @entity0			1
a video like the one showing @entity2 's killing " really energizes " supporters of @entity0 , and beheading is employed for " maximum propaganda " to " terrify " @entity0 ' enemies , @entity34 said			1
alternatively , @entity5 hostages , often journalists or aid workers , can be a useful tool if kept alive : either freed for hefty ransoms , used as bargaining chips for the militants ' ends or sold on to other extremist groups			1
it 's hard to know how many captives there are because governments , employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release			1
@entity0 is believed to be holding a number of @entity3 , a @entity3 official told @entity35 after @entity7 's execution			1
the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , declined to identify them or say exactly how many @entity3 are being held			1
missing journalists the @entity73 estimates that about 20 journalists are missing in @entity19 -- most of them local , some from outside @entity19			2
it says many of them are believed to be held by @entity0			1
among them is @entity79 , a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to the @entity82			0
he disappeared in @entity19 in august 2012			0
there has been no word of or from him since his abduction			0
altogether , more than 80 journalists have been abducted in @entity19 since the conflict started , according to the cpj			2
some have been freed , others killed			0
often a media blackout on journalists ' abductions is lifted only in best - and worst - case scenarios			1
the kidnapping of @entity3 journalist @entity96 was publicized only after he was handed over to @entity98 peacekeepers in august by @entity99 , a @entity19 rebel group with @entity101 ties , after almost two years in captivity			1
@entity105 officials helped secure his release , his family said			1
it emerged after @entity7 's death that @entity3 special operations units were sent into @entity19 this summer to rescue him and other hostages , but their mission proved unsuccessful			1
@entity112 , a spokesman for the news website @entity114 , also revealed that @entity0 had demanded a ransom of 100 million euros ( about $ 132 million ) for @entity7 's release			1
the journalist freelanced for @entity114 and other news organizations			0
after his death , @entity7 's mother , @entity119 , expressed concern about other hostages on the free james foley facebook page			2
" we implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages			2
like @entity128 , they are innocents			0
they have no control over @entity3 government policy in @entity20 , @entity19 or anywhere in the world , " she wrote			1
@entity2 's mother , @entity135 , also had directed an emotional plea for her son 's release to @entity0 leader @entity139 , to no avail			1
beheading of @entity3 journalist recalls past horrors to pay or not to pay ? fears for the safety of @entity5 held by @entity147 militants have also highlighted the different approaches taken by governments when it comes to kidnappings			1
the @entity153 government has a hard - line policy of never paying ransoms			1
the @entity3 government also does not negotiate with terrorists			1
at the same time , other @entity159 governments in the past are thought to have handed over cash to terror groups to ensure the release of nationals			2
the @entity3 , as in the case with the thwarted @entity7 mission , has in the past attempted hostage rescues			2
sometimes these can work out , as happened in 2012 when @entity169 rescued @entity3 aid worker @entity170 and fellow aid worker @entity171 of @entity173 after three months ' captivity in @entity175			2
they had been abducted while traveling there for the @entity178			0
but sometimes , such attempts fail			0
@entity180 , a kidnapped @entity153 aid worker , was accidentally killed by a @entity3 grenade during a seal rescue bid in @entity183 in 2010			1
the @entity153 government said it had attempted to rescue the @entity153 citizen shown in the latest @entity0 video " some time ago " but failed			1
@entity153 foreign secretary @entity186 provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works			2
" you would n't expect me to discuss various options that we will be considering , " he said			0
" but i can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person			0
" tortured , beaten in captivity while negotiations for potential releases continue , little or nothing is made public about the hostages ' background or their plight			0
out of public view , @entity2 's family members , their congressional representative and a number of government agencies had tried to gain his release for the past year			0
@entity3 secretary of state @entity210 highlighted the efforts made behind the scenes in a statement wednesday			1
" for so many who worked so long to bring @entity2 and the other @entity3 home safely , this was not how the story should 've ended , " he said			2
" it 's a punch to the gut			0
the @entity3 government has used every military , diplomatic and intelligence tool we have , and we always will			2
our special operations forces bravely risked a military operation to save these lives , and we 've reached out diplomatically to everyone and anyone who might be able to help			0
that effort continues , and our prayers remain -- as they always are -- with the families of all hostages who remain trapped in @entity19 today			0
" beaten , tortured after @entity7 's death , details slowly emerged of the experiences he endured after his abduction while he was on a reporting trip in northern @entity19 in november 2012			0
a source who says he was held last year with @entity7 told @entity35 's @entity238 that he , @entity7 and another journalist were held from march to august 2013 in a prison in @entity241 , @entity19			0
at the time , the source -- who spoke on condition of anonymity -- said they were being held by @entity99			0
at one point , according to the source , there were nearly 100 people -- including @entity159 journalists -- in the prison			0
the source said @entity7 and the other journalist , who was not @entity2 , were transferred to an @entity0 training camp			2
@entity7 and the other journalist , according to the source , were tortured in prison -- mostly beaten			0
@entity257 journalist @entity256 , who was taken hostage in june 2013 with @entity257 photographer @entity259 , told @entity35 that he also had been held with @entity260 in northern @entity19 before his release this year -- and that @entity7 " had to endure more because he was @entity3			1
" @entity263 and @entity259 were freed along with two other @entity257 journalists , @entity265 and @entity266 , on april 19			0
it 's not known what went on behind the scenes to secure their freedom , but @entity257 foreign minister @entity271 insisted that @entity257 had not paid a ransom , @entity267 reported at the time			2
other westerners held in @entity19 also have been released in recent months			0
two @entity275 journalists held for more than six months in @entity19 -- @entity277 staff correspondent @entity276 and freelance photographer @entity278 -- were freed in march			0
at the time of their capture , @entity277 said the journalists ' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to @entity0			1
and a @entity173 photographer , @entity286 , was freed in june , the @entity287 said , having been held captive in @entity19 since may 2013			0
@entity0 puts pressure on @entity289 to act			2

@entity0 has other @entity5 hostages besides the two murdered @entity3 journalists
hostages can be useful bargaining chips or *exchanged* for ransom payments
@entity3 and @entity153 governments have policies against paying ransom for hostages
abductions are often kept quiet for fear of *jeopardizing* efforts to secure the release of the victims
