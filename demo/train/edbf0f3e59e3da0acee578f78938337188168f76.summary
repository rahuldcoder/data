-- gosh , you guys really hate selfie			2
and we see the hate runs so deep you do n't mean just the images , you mean the word itself			1
each year , the overseers of the overwrought phrase usage at @entity11 in @entity12 ask the public to send in nominations of words or terms that drive them crazy			1
their @entity18 to be banished from the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 gets thousands of submissions and then it narrows the list to 13			1
because that 's what we need at the end of the year , a top 10 + list of something ! a quick and totally unscientific search of @entity0 in 2013 reveals three dozen references to selfie , which includes stories about president @entity33 's selfie controversy , selfies taken at funerals , selfie tips and the fact that some organization called the @entity39 had the nerve to name selfie the global word of the year			1
and selfie only just became an honest - to - goodness real word			1
we may not be able to keep people from posting them online , but we can try to get them to use another word			1
" a self - snapped picture need not have a name all its own beyond ' photograph			2
' it may only be a matter of time before photos of one 's self and a friend will become ' dualies , ' " wrote nominators @entity51 , @entity52 , and @entity53 , @entity54			2
another critic said the term is full of self - importance			2
" @entity67 disparages the word because it 's too selfie - serving , " wrote @entity65 of @entity66			1
" but enough about me , how about yourselfie ? " but the battle between the @entity11 folks and the @entity39 crew does n't end there			1
the award - winning " twerk " also gets the thumbs down from the 39th edition of the banishment list			1
what is twerking ? i 'm not sure i can accurately capture it in words , so watch this , but quickly			1
@entity65 from @entity66 comes back strong again			2
" i twitch when i hear twerk , for to twerk proves one is a jerk -- or is at least twitching like a jerk			1
@entity89 has brought us to a new low in our lexicon , " she wrote			2
some of the phrases were a bit surprising to some of us , but if you insist , i guess it 's time to retire mister @entity98 and t - bone , the verb , as in one car @entity102 - boned the other			2
" while the accident 's layout does , indeed , resemble its namesake cut of beef , we 'd prefer to dispense with the collateral imagery and enjoy a great steak , " the barons of overused phrases wrote			0
as for mr. @entity98 , well , that movie came out 30 years ago ( kids , it 's hilarious ) , and the idea of a man staying home while a wife works is not so novel any more			0
" i am a stay - at - home dad / parent			0
and if you call me ' mr. @entity98 , ' i will punch you in the throat , " said @entity120 , @entity121			0
we agree , the guy in the movie was a bit clueless about how to care for the little ones and the house			0
we went over to the @entity129 to see the reaction to the call for the end of " @entity129			1
" apparently many people missed the memo on that ( i can use that -- missed the memo has n't made the complete list yet )			1
another @entity140 word to make the 2013 list was the written out or spoken hashtag			1
the symbol # is fine , apparently			0
read the previous " banished " words list " typed on sites that use them , that 's one thing			1
when verbally spoken , hashtag - itgetsoldquickly			0
so , hashtag - knockitoff , " typed @entity148 of @entity149 , @entity150			0
but @entity151 from @entity152 , @entity12 , thinks : " it 's # obnoxious # ridiculous # annoying and i wish it would disappear			1
" we concur , @entity151			0
# soundslikeagoodidea # notgoingtohappenanytimesoon sports fans contributed two words -- " adversity " and " fan base			1
" @entity162 user @entity161 had an even better idea , getting rid of " nation " after every team 's nickname to describe their fans base			0
and adversity ? in a sporting event ? it means " a state , condition , or instance of serious or continued difficulty or adverse fortune , " according to @entity175			0
" facing adversity is working 50 hours a week and still struggling to feed your kids			0
facing third and fifteen without your best receiver with tens of millions in the bank , is not , " @entity179 , @entity12 , wrote			1
another phrase that likely got its start in sports but leaked into other usage and needs to go is " _ _ _ _ _ _ _ on steroids "			0
for instance , it 's like a fast food restaurant on steroids			0
wow , it must be , um , great			0
there were a few huge crises on the planet in 2013 but it 's still here			0
so the use of " - ageddon " and " - pocalypse " got old quickly			0
we say there will be no @entity199 2014			0
and we pray there is no a global shortage of pork products as the world must avoid using @entity204 , or worse , @entity205			0
the list also included two terms associated with politics , or at least with @entity209			2
intellectually / @entity210 was one			0
@entity211 of @entity212 , @entity213 , wondered : " are there intellectual creditors ? " and the other was @entity217 , which appears in the media approximately every 3.2 seconds			1
however , that is easier to fit in a headline or ticker than " @entity217			1
" just sayin ' ( also not banned -- yet )			2
which words would you be happy to never , ever hear again ? let us know in the comments .			2

selfies are *loathed* by many social media users , and the word is , too
