@entity0 -- @entity3 premier @entity2 is in @entity4 on his first foreign trip since assuming the post and has begun diplomatic talks at a delicate time for the world 's two most populous nations			1
just weeks ago , the world witnessed the latest chapter in one of @entity15 's least understood disputes when soldiers from @entity3 's @entity17 crossed the border and set up an encampment in the mountains at the edge of the @entity4 region of @entity23			1
the troops have since withdrawn , but the incident served as a stark reminder of the smoldering problem that still bedevils the @entity15 behemoths			0
the origins of the struggle for this charged corner of the world lies in the realpolitik and imperialism of the 19th and 20th centuries			0
according to a report by the @entity40 , the @entity38 , installed in their @entity4 colony , attempted to demarcate their holdings with the " @entity43			2
" @entity44 : @entity4 protest @entity3 's incursion drawn by the surveyor , @entity47 in 1864 , it claimed the area known as @entity49 as part of @entity4 's @entity23 territory			1
the @entity38 later repudiated the line and , in 1899 , replaced it with the @entity53			0
the new line moved @entity49 back to @entity3			2
after @entity55 , the @entity38 reversed themselves again , placing @entity49 back in @entity4 , but never made any effort to exert formal authority			2
in 1947 , newly independent @entity4 drew their border to reflect the more generous @entity43 even though they had not exerted an iota of control over @entity49 for almost half a century			1
the @entity23 incursion puts a wrinkle on what seemed to be a burgeoning era of @entity3 - @entity4 bonhomie			1
in recent years , both nations have bent over backwards to demonstrate their mutual good will			0
bilateral trade is expected to hit $ 100 billion by 2015 , joint military exercises were held last year ( after previously being suspended ) and both sides had agreed to respect a more favorable boundary for @entity3 known as the " @entity72			2
" but @entity3 's recent advance beyond the de facto border is hardly without precedent			1
according to @entity76 , @entity3 has violated the @entity72 more than 500 times since 2010			2
though experts have described many of these transgressions as " routine , " and regular military contact exists between the two governments , any " mistake " that were to occur by the @entity3 army on @entity4 soil could be volatile			1
particularly in @entity3 , journalist - stoked jingoism can turn even the most banal activity into an absurd ballet of face - saving			0
far - fetched ? in 2002 , @entity92 soldiers in @entity93 accidentally ran over and killed two 14 - year - old girls			0
the @entity96 , as it became known , sparked a fury of anti-american protests and severely tested the @entity92 - @entity93 relationship -- and @entity92 was there legally			0
how would @entity4 and @entity3 resolve a similar incident ? " mistakes can be made , " said @entity101 , professor of strategy & globalization , at the @entity104 at @entity104 and co-founder of the @entity3 - @entity106			1
" however , i do not believe that either @entity3 or @entity4 is looking for a fight			1
" @entity101 stressed that @entity3 's latest incursion should be seen in a regional context as a test of " muscle - flexing " and that its actions were not indicative of any real desire to acquire new territory			1
muscle - flexing or not , what is certain is that in recent years @entity3 has become a very bad neighbor			0
their @entity4 claims extend over a 6,530 - kilometer ( 4,057 - mile ) border , which includes a sizeable chunk of the @entity4 state of @entity122 and large swaths of @entity124			2
in the last year the world saw the strident revival of @entity3 's long dormant claim to the @entity128 , as well as a string of others extending as far south as the @entity131 , a mere 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) from the @entity133 coast			2
while the risk of conflict between @entity3 and @entity4 will always remain until a final resolution is reached , going forward , there are reasons to believe that the two sides will be able to continue on a relatively peaceful track			1
@entity3 's relationship with @entity4 is far more benign than its one with their other regional antagonist , @entity145			1
the 1962 @entity146 , fought for this very territory , is all but forgotten among @entity3 citizens , while memories of @entity145 hostilities during @entity151 are as raw as ever			0
as the @entity152 reported in her book : " @entity3 : @entity157 , " @entity3 's relationship with @entity145 is highly sensitive and thus subject to the counterproductive impulses of popular nationalism			2
by contrast , @entity3 's relations with @entity4 stir no such emotions and are handled out of the spotlight with greater room to maneuver			1
@entity163 too will likely promote cooler heads			0
as @entity101 noted , @entity4 's importance to @entity3 will only increase as @entity4 's economy grows			1
as a market for exports and investments , he predicted that @entity4 would become an invaluable partner			0
" i see the next five years as high risk , " said @entity101			0
" then i think we can all be a lot more relaxed			0
" unfortunately , it remains a truism that facts on the ground often move faster than governments ' ability to respond to them			0
in the absence of a resolution , the world can only hope that @entity4 and @entity3 succeed in kicking their differences down the road indefinitely , because if their dispute ever does come to a head , the consequences could be catastrophic			1
