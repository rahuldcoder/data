the annual match between the winners of the @entity13 and @entity14 , have rarely been classics and this was no exception on a poor quality pitch at the @entity20 stadium			0
@entity6 did not create a single opening in normal time while @entity4 at least showed some intent in a match of few chances			1
@entity26 has a snapshot that flew just over the crossbar while a quick free - kick from @entity30 saw @entity31 sting the fingers of @entity33 in the @entity6 goal -- and the keeper recovered quickly to deny the lurking @entity26			2
if the first half had been disappointing , there was little to lift spirits in the second			0
@entity31 hit a fierce left - foot effort that @entity33 could only parry , and when the ball drifted out to @entity26 by the left touchline he took deliberate aim to loop a shot into the far corner but the @entity6 keeper climbed just high enough to turn it over			2
in the 98th minute , @entity48 made his first save , diving low to keep out @entity52 's goal - bound shot			0
@entity54 , on for @entity26 , could have wrapped it up with two chances before , having barely threatened , the @entity53 were denied a blatant penalty when @entity58 was felled			0
@entity6 coach @entity59 stormed onto the pitch in fury but it was all in vain as @entity31 's brilliant pass set up @entity2 for the latest of winners .			1

a goal from @entity2 gives @entity4 a 1 - 0 win over @entity6
@entity70 was set up by @entity31 in extra time as @entity4 won @entity8
there were *precious* few chances in the match played on a poor @entity9 pitch
