@entity0 grew up in @entity1 in @entity2			1
his parents still live there			2
he still keeps an office there			2
but it 's not the same neighborhood he grew up in , and his feelings about newcomers now inhabiting once - blighted parts of @entity12 's most - populous city like @entity1 slapped many people in the face after the famed director went into an expletive - laced rant during an @entity18 lecture on tuesday			2
" i grew up here in @entity20			1
it 's changed , " @entity0 said at @entity2 's @entity21 , an art , design , and architecture school			1
" and why does it take an influx of white @entity20 in the @entity27 , in @entity28 , in @entity29 , in @entity30 for the facilities to get better ? the garbage was n't picked up every mother * * * * * * * day when i was living in 165 @entity34			1
... the police were n't around			2
when you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers , three o'clock in the morning on @entity40 , that must tell you something			2
" @entity44 , a professor of urban policy and planning at @entity48 's @entity47 , said the city has witnessed an enormous recovery since 2001 , and the greatest change has been felt in @entity2 , which has drawn newcomers because of its housing , access to @entity55 and improved safety			1
" cities do n't stand still , and the cities that stand still are @entity59 , " @entity44 said			1
" so if @entity0 wants to see a place where there is no gentrification , he 'll also find a place where there are no investments			1
obviously , he 's someone who knows how to make a movie but does n't know anything about cities			2
" he added : " @entity2 has become more attractive to more people			0
of course , that means some people are going to have to find other places to live , but that 's the magic of @entity20			1
today , @entity76 , which was an area that people were afraid to go to , now has some of the best restaurants in the city			0
" the new neighbors complain " let me just kill you right now , " @entity0 , the " @entity85 " director , told @entity86 , a @entity2 homeowner and tech start - up director , at the speech when @entity86 brought up the subject of the " other side " of gentrification			1
and then he launched his lengthy tirade			0
on wednesday , @entity0 told " @entity96 " that he 's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly @entity95			1
" my problem is that when you move into a neighborhood , have some respect for the history , for the culture , " @entity0 said			1
@entity86 , the managing director of the start - up @entity103 , told @entity105 that he does n't mind that @entity0 ripped into him and would n't let him interject			1
@entity86 told @entity0 on tuesday that he did n't dispute his point that services in the neighborhoods had changed after the new people -- most of whom are white -- moved in			1
" whoa , whoa , whoa ... " said @entity0			1
" let me kill you some more			0
" " can i talk about something ? " @entity86 said			1
then comes the mother * * * * * * ' @entity112			0
you ca n't discover this ! we been here , " he said to applause from the audience			0
he gave the examples of people playing drums in @entity123 , a tradition he said lasted 40 years until the new residents complained			0
and then there was the one that literally hit home			0
@entity0 said his father , " a great jazz musician , " bought a brownstone 46 years ago			1
" and the mother * * * * * * ' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father			0
he 's not â€” he does n't even play electric bass			0
we bought the mother * * * * * * ' house in 1968 , and now you call the cops ? in 2013 ? " according to a @entity147 article , police have received 17 noise complaints			0
the @entity147 said a woman who lived next door had called most			0
@entity0 : why are the services finally better ? @entity0 lamented that @entity34 in the morning resembled the @entity152 with hip dogs and that real estate brokers and " mother * * * * * * * hipsters " conspired to change the names of neighborhoods like the @entity27 to @entity27 or @entity76 to @entity157			1
" so , why did it take this great influx of white people to get the schools better ? " @entity0 asked			1
" why 's there more police protection in @entity29 and @entity28 now ? why 's the garbage getting picked up more regularly ? we been here ! " @entity86 could n't get a word in during @entity0 's speech tuesday night			1
but the next day he said he was glad the filmmaker got people talking about the issue			2
" what i wanted to do was expand the dialogue , " he told @entity105 's " @entity175			1
" there is another side , resident says but @entity86 said there was a definite lack of balance in @entity0 's rant			1
" i 'm black , and @entity12 is @entity12 , " he said			0
" i do n't need to moan and groan about it all the time			0
and some things are bigger than @entity29 or @entity1 or being black in @entity2			0
gentrification is an issue everywhere			2
it gets right down to the whole economic scene with the super rich , the 1 % , and then the other 99 % of us			0
" @entity86 said that when he bought his parents ' four - story brownstone in 1989 , he thought he 'd be lucky to one day get $ 450,000 for it			2
" we passed that some time in the ' 90s , " he said			0
" i 'm personally tired of moaning and groaning about being black , " he said			0
" here 's a case where it has its advantages -- for the first time tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of blacks can participate in @entity12 wealth creation			0
my @entity203 , that 's what this country is all about			0
" referring to reports that @entity0 's 9,000 - square - foot mansion on @entity55 's @entity208 is on the market for $ 32 million , @entity86 said : " @entity210 is a causative factor in gentrification			1
if @entity210 moves to a swamp ... that land next door goes up immediately			0
" but @entity86 does n't disagree entirely with @entity0			1
" i 've had incidents with the dogs of new owners crapping on the sidewalks			0
they do n't think anybody lives there , " he said , adding that most are " wonderful new neighbors			0
" @entity0 did n't dispute to @entity96 that gentrification brings rising home prices , but he worried about what became of the people who were priced out of the neighborhood			1
but what cost ? if we lose half of the @entity95 - @entity12 population , in my neighborhood , @entity1 , and the schools become better , what happened to half the people that left ? " and he was angry that city services improved when the neighborhood profile changed			0
" i just find it interesting you have to have an influx of white @entity20 to move into these neighborhoods for the services to go up , for the schools to be better , " he told @entity105			2
" they get better sanitation , get more police protection			0
why did n't that happened before gentrification ? we 're still paying taxes			2
" @entity0 slams the @entity255 hate machine			2
