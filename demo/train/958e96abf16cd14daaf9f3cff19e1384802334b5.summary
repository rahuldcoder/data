how to react to @entity2 's new smiley - faced president , @entity0 ? smile back , but do n't stop squeezing @entity2 with sanctions			1
@entity0 has offered a series of positive gestures since taking office in early august			2
he has released some political prisoners			0
he sent @entity9 's greetings to @entity10 in @entity2 and around the world			1
he took a phone call from the president of the @entity14			2
does any of this portend real change in @entity2 ? the case for skepticism is strong			1
none of the regime has changed in any way			0
@entity2 continues to make mischief through the region , most horrifically by supporting the brutal actions of the @entity26 regime in @entity27			1
as far as anyone can tell , @entity2 pursues nuclear weapons as determinedly as ever			2
@entity0 himself is no liberal and no @entity31			0
an early supporter of the @entity35 , @entity0 held senior positions in the @entity2 state during the regime 's most vicious period of international terrorism , the early 1990s - the years in which @entity2 - backed terrorists carried out assassinations in @entity42 and @entity43 and carried out two terrible bombings of @entity10 targets in @entity46 , killing 114 people and wounding nearly a thousand more			1
as @entity2 's chief nuclear negotiator in the 2000s , @entity0 nimbly evaded international efforts to achieve a peaceful end to the country 's drive for weapons of mass death			1
more fundamentally , the president of @entity2 does not govern the country 's national security system			1
the military and the secret police answer to the supreme leader , the @entity61 , who has very emphatic geopolitical ideas of his own			0
compared with all that , a cheerful tweet and a few words of condemnation of @entity68 crimes do n't seem much of an offset			0
but there is an " on the other hand			0
" on the other hand , sanctions have been biting @entity2 hard the past year			1
the currency has plunged in value , inflation rages , goods have become scarce in the shops			0
@entity2 's leaders have seen other authoritarian rulers swept from power in @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 - and pushed to the very brink in @entity27			1
has @entity2 's leadership become frightened that it could fall victim to similar grievances ? if anything , @entity2 's economic situation has deteriorated further and faster than that of any of the countries in which leaders were toppled			1
@entity2 elections are neither free nor fair			0
but @entity2 elections do permit some controlled airing of public grievances			0
@entity0 has been quoted as saying that he does not approve of @entity2 's centrifuges spinning while the economy remains stagnant			1
as so often the case with him , these are very ambiguous words			0
perhaps he means that he 'd like to accelerate the spinning of both the centrifuges and the economy			0
perhaps he is expressing a purely personal and ineffectual opinion			0
but it 's worth the effort to explore whether he and his colleagues might mean something more			0
@entity109 diplomats often succumb to the @entity2 demand that we accept total responsibility for the @entity2 - @entity114 relationship while assigning @entity2 none			2
last week , the @entity117 magazine indulged yet another example of this tendency when it quoted @entity120 , former ambassador to @entity121 and @entity122 , as suggesting that we might have reached a deal with @entity2 in 2002 if only president @entity125 had not bruised the mullah 's feelings with his " axis of evil " speech , in whose drafting i played a role			2
the hope that some magic incantation might change @entity2 springs eternal , but states are more thick - skinned than that			1
they act for deep reasons of interest			0
@entity2 's policy toward the @entity114 originates inside the regime , and so will any changes of that policy			1
if those changes have begun , the @entity14 should be ready to recognize and welcome them			0
but there should be no mistaking why those changes have begun : economic pressure from @entity109 - imposed sanctions and fear of @entity14 - backed military action			1
end the pressure and the fear prematurely , and the changes will end			0
@entity2 's nuclear program must be closed down for good			1
@entity2 's long record of evasion and deceit requires more than mere promises - we must see decisive and irrevocable proof			1
until @entity2 changes policy , we do n't change policy			2
but if @entity2 changes its tone , we can change tone , too			2
a smile is a helpful start , so long as we all understand that it 's only a start .			2

@entity167 : in face of @entity0 's moves , @entity14 should smile back , keep up sanctions
he says there 's reason for skepticism ; @entity0 has *history* in terrorism - backing regime
he says @entity61 holds the real power ; still , there 's hope some change may begin
@entity184 : @entity2 has long record of deceit ; for progress , nuke program must be shut down
