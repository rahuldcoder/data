i used to be able to justify using @entity1 as a cost of doing business			1
as a writer and sometime activist who needs to promote my books and articles and occasionally rally people to one cause or another , i found @entity1 fast and convenient			1
though i never really used it to socialize , i figured it was ok to let other people do that , and i benefited from their behavior			0
i can no longer justify this arrangement			0
today , i am surrendering my @entity1 account , because my participation on the site is simply too inconsistent with the values i espouse in my work			1
in my upcoming book " @entity23 , " i chronicle some of what happens when we can no longer manage our many online presences			0
i have always argued for engaging with technology as conscious human beings and dispensing with technologies that take that agency away			0
@entity1 is just such a technology			1
it does things on our behalf when we 're not even there			0
it actively misrepresents us to our friends , and worse misrepresents those who have befriended us to still others			2
to enable this dysfunctional situation -- i call it " digiphrenia " -- would be at the very least hypocritical			0
but to participate on @entity1 as an author , in a way specifically intended to draw out the " likes " and resulting vulnerability of others , is untenable			1
@entity1 has never been merely a social platform			1
rather , it exploits our social interactions the way a @entity48 party does			0
@entity1 does not exist to help us make friends , but to turn our network of connections , brand preferences and activities over time -- our " social graphs " -- into money for others			1
we facebook users have been building a treasure lode of big data that government and corporate researchers have been mining to predict and influence what we buy and for whom we vote			1
we have been handing over to them vast quantities of information about ourselves and our friends , loved ones and acquaintances			0
with this information , @entity1 and the " big data " research firms purchasing their data predict still more things about us -- from our future product purchases or sexual orientation to our likelihood for civil disobedience or even terrorism			1
the true end users of @entity1 are the marketers who want to reach and influence us			1
they are @entity1 's paying customers ; we are the product			1
and we are its workers			2
the countless hours that we -- and the young , particularly -- spend on our profiles are the unpaid labor on which @entity1 justifies its stock valuation			2
the efforts of a few thousand employees at @entity1 's @entity90 campus pale in comparison to those of the hundreds of millions of users meticulously tweaking their pages			1
corporations used to have to do research to assemble our consumer profiles ; now we do it for them			0
the information collected about you by @entity1 through my @entity1 page is n't even shared with me			2
thanks to my page , @entity1 knows the demographics of my readership , their e-mails , what else they like , who else they know and , perhaps most significant , who they trust			1
and @entity1 is taking pains not to share any of this , going so far as to limit the ability of third - party applications to utilize any of this data			1
given that this was the foundation for @entity1 's business plan from the start , perhaps more recent developments in the company 's ever - evolving user agreement should n't have been so disheartening			2
still , we bridle at the notion that any of our updates might be converted into " sponsored stories " by whatever business or brand we may have mentioned			0
that innocent mention of cup of coffee at @entity131 , in the @entity1 universe , quickly becomes an attributed endorsement of their brand			2
remember , the only way to connect with something or someone is to " like " them			0
this means if you want to find out what a politician or company you do n't like is up to , you still have to endorse them publicly			0
more recently , users -- particularly those with larger sets of friends , followers and likes -- learned that their updates were no longer reaching all of the people who had signed up to get them			1
now , we are supposed to pay to " promote " our posts to our friends and , if we pay even more , to their friends			0
yes , @entity1 is entitled to be paid for promoting us and our interests -- but this was n't the deal going in , particularly not for companies who paid @entity1 for extra followers in the first place			1
neither should users who " friend " my page automatically become the passive conduits for any of my messages to all their friends just because i paid for it			2
that brings me to @entity1 's most recent shift , and the one that pushed me over the edge			2
through a new variation of the @entity179 feature called @entity180 , users who " like " something can be unwittingly associated with pretty much anything an advertiser pays for			1
like e-mail spam with a spoofed identity , the @entity185 shows up in a newsfeed right under the user 's name and picture			0
if you like me , you can be shown implicitly recommending me or something i like -- something you 've never heard of -- to others without your consent			0
for now , as long as i do n't like anything myself , i have some measure of control over what those who follow me receive in my name or , worse , are made to appear to be endorsing , themselves			0
but i feel that control slipping away , and can not remain part of a system where liking me or my work can be used against you			0
the promotional leverage that @entity1 affords me is not worth the price			2
besides , how can i ask you to like me , when i myself must refuse to like you or anything else ? i have always appreciated that agreeing to become publicly linked to me and my work online involves trust			0
it is a trust i value , but -- as it is dependent on the good graces of @entity1 -- it is a trust i can live up to only by unfriending this particularly anti-social social network			1
maybe in doing so i 'll help people remember that @entity1 is not the internet			2
it 's just one website , and it comes with a price .			0

@entity222 : @entity1 has been very useful to him but now goes too far
he says its @entity180 features misrepresents " likes " of users without their consent
facebook users have always been its workers , providing info about themselves to data miners
@entity222 : @entity180 takes too much control , causes him to break trust with followers
