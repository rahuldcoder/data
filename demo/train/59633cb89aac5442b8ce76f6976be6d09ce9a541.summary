hey kids ! forget trying to become a doctor or rapper or a football star , not to mention all the teasing you may get in school for being a nerd -- computers are where it 's at			0
that 's one message of a new video in which @entity15 chairman @entity14 , @entity17 co-founder @entity16 , @entity19 co-founder @entity18 and other tech execs urge young people to learn computer programming			1
" learning how to program did n't start off with wanting to learn all of computer science or trying to master this discipline or anything like that , " @entity16 says			1
" it started off because i wanted to do this one simple thing -- i wanted to make something that was fun for myself and my sisters			0
" @entity14 says , " i was 13 when i first got access to a computer			1
i wrote a program to play tick - tack - toe			1
" the five - minute clip , called " what most schools do n't teach , " was posted online tuesday by @entity38 , a new nonprofit foundation that seeks to cultivate computer science in @entity41 school curricula			1
the foundation argues there is a worldwide shortage of computer programmers but that only 1 in 10 schools in @entity41 teach kids how to code			1
" our policy ( at @entity17 ) is literally to hire as many talented engineers as we can find , " @entity16 says			2
" the whole limit in the system is that there are n't enough people who are trained and have these skills today			0
" the @entity17 ceo appears to be passionate about supporting technology and science education			2
last week @entity16 and a handful of other tech execs announced a $ 3 million annual prize for researchers doing life - saving work , saying he hoped it would inspire future scientists			1
the " what most schools do n't teach " clip tries to make coding seem accessible and easy for anyone with a basic understanding of math. " addition , subtraction , that 's about it , " @entity14 says with a smile			1
" it 's really not unlike playing an instrument , or playing a sport , " says @entity77 , who created file - sharing site @entity79			0
" even if you want to become a race - car driver , or play baseball , or , you know , build a house -- all of these things have been turned upside down by software			0
" also featured in the video are musician @entity92 and @entity95 star @entity94 , both of whom have taken coding classes			0
there 's been much recent hand - wringing in @entity101 about how the @entity41 is lagging behind other countries in developing future software engineers			0
@entity38 claims that computer - programming jobs are growing at twice the @entity41 national average while less than 2.4 % of college students graduate with degrees in computer science -- less than 10 years ago			1
the video also emphasizes the perks and casual vibe of working at a deep - pocketed tech company , where employees get free food , work barefoot and skateboard around the office			2
" the programmers of tomorrow are the wizards of the future , " says @entity117 , co-founder of video game developer valve			0
" you 're going to look like you have magic powers compared to everybody else			0
" the clip already has been viewed more than 2 million times on @entity126			0
@entity38 hopes to get it shown in schools across the country .			2
