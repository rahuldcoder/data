@entity0 , @entity1 -- the face of the @entity4 is well known the world over : athletes winning , losing , straining every sinew of their bodies in the pursuit of podium glory			1
but behind the scenes there is another story of the athletes ' lives and the use of their bodies , one that centers on their time staying at the @entity19			1
" anyone who wants to be naive and say they do n't know what 's going on in the @entity19 are lying to themselves , " one former gold medalist and veteran of two @entity4 told @entity2 of his previous experiences at the @entity4			1
" they know , the officials know , even the media			2
it 's not a secret , everyone knows ! " ( @entity32 ) is all part of the @entity4 spirit			1
the @entity35 ( @entity35 ) would n't say that , but it is , you ca n't shy away from it			2
why do you think they give away so many condoms ? " the @entity41 at the @entity4 is a unique environment : nearly 3,000 tightly packed apartments , containing over 10,000 of the world 's finest athletes who have traveled from more than 200 countries around the world to stay for a two - week sporting jamboree			1
a potent mix of fit , body beautiful , young people -- many of whom have abstained from sexual intercourse as part of a disciplined training regime -- being in the same place , at the same time ; cocooned from the outside world by tight security and often reveling in the glory of success and attention of devoted crowds and the world 's press			1
@entity4 live blog it is maybe only human nature that people , when placed together , procreate to some extent , but that libidinous cocktail means @entity74 officials were right if the experiences of @entity76 and @entity77 were anything to make 150,000 condoms -- a record for the modern games -- available to the @entity19 's frisky inhabitants , according to @entity2 's source " the athletes do n't know what to expect the first time they go to the @entity4 , but it just happens , " added the former gold medalist , who is now approaching his late 30s , looking back at his @entity4 experiences			1
" as soon as you finish competing there 's no sleeping until the next day ! " many of the volunteers ( in the @entity19 ) would say ' oh , what is your room like ? ' and i knew they were not really wanting to see the room			1
it 's just fun , they are excited to be with the athletes			1
" you talk , you go to your room			2
let me say this ... there were lots of volunteers and they were happy to help you with whatever your needs were			2
" my roommate and i would put something on the door so we would know if the other was ' busy '			2
i feel bad to say it but my coach actually guarded the door the night before me and my roommate were racing ( because of our reputations ) ! but it did n't affect me like that			2
when i raced after sex i felt light on my feet			2
" we were young and most of the people i hung out with were single			2
@entity126 told it basically like it is , " said the runner , referring to the @entity125 female soccer team goalkeeper			2
solo is one of the few current athletes to have been candid about her experience of the @entity19 environment			1
" there 's a lot of sex going on , " said the 30 - year - old keeper in an interview with @entity135 , prior to the @entity136			1
" with a once - in - a - lifetime experience , you want to build memories , whether it 's sexual , partying or on the field			1
i 've seen people having sex right out in the open			2
on the grass , between buildings , people are getting down and dirty			0
" the anonymous runner who spoke to @entity2 , said that he found himself in the exact situation @entity152 had described , despite the surveillance of airborne security at the village employed after a bomb exploded at the @entity157 in 1996			0
" it was around one in the morning and security would n't let us out of the @entity19 , so me and my roommate went to the cafeteria for something to eat			1
the girls in there said , ' oh , we finish in an hour , what are you guys doing ? ' so we said ' we 're heading back to our room '			0
they asked if they could walk with us , and all i will say is we did n't make it back to the room -- and this with the helicopters flying over with their searchlights ! it was ok , we were under trees			0
" shenanigans that would conceivably come as no surprise to swimmer @entity178 and winner of five medals in the @entity1 pool			0
" seventy to 75 percent of @entity183 hook up behind the scenes , " the 27 - year - old swimmer told @entity135 in july			0
" hey , sometimes you got ta do what you got ta do			0
" solo believes the friendly nature of the @entity4 makes it easy to meet people			0
" unlike at a bar , it 's not awkward to strike up a conversation because you have something in common , " @entity152 told @entity135			1
" it starts with , ' what sport do you play ? ' all of a sudden , you 're fist - bumping			0
" " @entity76 was the best , they were so welcoming , friendly and passionate , " said @entity2 's anonymous athlete , referring to the @entity198			1
" in @entity76 it was like going back to your school reunion and seeing people you have n't seen for a few years			0
athletes from the @entity205 , @entity206 , friends that you keep with on the circuit all excited about being there			1
the @entity4 spirit somehow touches everyone			0
" in the @entity19 you have an official masseuse and i was having problems with my leg after my race			1
so i went to the medical center which ultimately led to me having a rub down and i remember the very pretty lady who was going to treat me			1
she said : ' please take off your clothes ' and then she said ' @entity222 , look at your body , i 've never seen a body like this ! ' so she helped with the rub down and afterwards i knew something was going to happen , and it did			0
" @entity4 athletes ' extreme eating habits however , it is not just the sexually - charged nature of the @entity41 that makes it such unique accommodation			2
according to former 100 - meter men 's champion @entity234 , the @entity19 offers a unique opportunity to spend time , and often to make friends , with other athletes and even rivals			1
" i loved staying in the @entity19 , when i was @entity241 captain i encouraged people to stay there because how on earth will the young athletes develop if all the experienced stars stay away ? it 's a way to take your mind of the pressure of your event , " said @entity246 , who is working with @entity2 during the @entity4			1
" in 1992 there was the basketball ' @entity254 ' and you see @entity256 walking around in the cafeteria -- it was like ' woooh ! ' you look up to him , firstly , because he was seven foot but also because he was a big star			0
i collected autographs in there , for other people			0
" and in track and field the people that you compete against are often your good friends			0
i met @entity268 that way			0
i 've got a good friend who was a @entity272 handball player and have friends from swimming as well as track and field			0
i met people through sport that i would never have met otherwise			0
" @entity277 also creates an environment in which national teams can bond			0
" i think it 's very positive , because it 's a shared experience and it 's a leveler , " said @entity246			1
" sometimes the food was bad , but if i performed as team captain and i 'd eaten the same food then that was a message for the team : it was no excuse			0
it 's fun , you can hang out with superstars and you get a chance to talk to people instead of being cocooned in a hotel on your own somewhere			2
" @entity293 , a veteran of the @entity294 and @entity295 , also felt staying at the @entity19 was a vital part of the @entity4 experience			1
" you know you 've arrived when you get to the @entity19			1
@entity300 are there and everything is available for your needs , " he said			0
" i 'm quite an insular person , self - centered even , and the @entity41 was good for my preparation because everything there is about ' you '			0
you can decide whether or not you want to speak to the press or not			0
if you have a niggle then there 's a doctor , physio , all there ready to go , " the 400 - meter runner and hurdler told @entity2			2
" @entity315 had the best facilities			0
we could e-mail and get information straightaway as it was the beginning of internet facilities			0
they had 24/7 movies , great food and it was my first time in @entity125 , @entity323 ! it was phenomenal games			0
" for 17 days we were the center of the universe			1
and if people were getting jiggy that 's fine but that was n't my experience or a lot of other athletes			1

@entity74 distributed 150 , 000 condoms to athletes
@entity19 comprises nearly 3000 apartments , *housing* over 10,000 athletes
@entity234 : " i think it 's very positive *[* @entity19 life *]* because it 's a shared experience and it 's a leveler "
