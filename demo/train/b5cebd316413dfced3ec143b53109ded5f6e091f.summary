-- this is a selfie made of blood			1
yes , real , straight - from - veins - of - a - human blood			2
the human you 're looking at is @entity7 , an artist living in @entity8			1
these are his first blood paintings			0
@entity7 created the works for an upcoming exhibition , @entity10 , opening september 11 at the @entity13 in @entity14 , and it should be noted that he did n't originally set out to paint with his vital fluids			1
then again , who does ? the whole weird thing came about as a larger investigation into how @entity7 could use a @entity20 milling machine in new ways to create his artworks			2
you 'll notice the blood is actually dispensed onto a brush controlled by the @entity20 's robotic arm			1
one day as an experiment , @entity7 hooked up a pen to the cnc machine 's arm to see how it might draw			1
it drew really well ! " i was doing a drawing of the moon and thought , ' oh , this could be really cool to do in my own blood , " he recalls			0
" it was a logical progression			1
" any logicality involving drawing with your own blood is debatable , but @entity7 persisted and adapted his process to replace traditional ink with body ink			1
to make his selfie , @entity7 began by taking a photo of himself in the nude			2
in @entity47 he rendered the photo into vectors then used @entity50 to turn the art into code that the cnc machine could read			0
@entity7 hooked himself up to a needle and funneled his blood into the machine like one might do with ink			1
the machine dispensed lines of blood , creating a pixelated version of @entity7 's original photo			1
" if you 're right up close to it , you can almost see the lines of code , " he says of the artwork			0
blood is n't an easy medium the issue with blood , or any other liquid for that matter , is that it tends to pool on paper			0
to combat this , @entity7 constructed a completely flat table and used a vacuum to suck the paper against it as tightly as possible			2
this allowed the blood to dispense evenly onto the paper , reducing the risk of globbing			0
after the paintings were finished , @entity7 sprayed them with an acrylic fixativeâ € ” " so they do n't rot , " he notes			2
there 's a trick to making a good blood painting			0
@entity7 's involves lots of water and a pre blood - letting cheeseburger			1
" i found that fatty foods make for a nicer flow , " he explains			0
lots of practice helps , too			0
@entity7 experimented with making two full - sized selfies before he finished the final painting			1
the selfie painting took around three hours to complete , but @entity7 says the total blood used is probably less than what you 'd regularly donate			1
despite describing himself as squeamish when it comes to blood and needles , the artist has found that if you stick a needle in your arm enough times , it gets easier to ignore			2
" blood is just a medium , " he says			0
" when you focus on something other than yourself , like making a drawing , it becomes ink and stops being blood			0
" more from @entity0 : the mystery of go , the ancient game that computers still ca n't win 30 years after @entity127 's meltdown , gripping photos expose the human fallout i liked everything i saw on @entity131 for two days			0

@entity7 uses a robot to print selfies -- using his blood in place of ink
the @entity8 - based artist uses a computer - controlled arm to paint his blood onto a canvas
he calls the new *technique* a " logical progression "
