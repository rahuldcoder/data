@entity0 , @entity1 -- a doctor 's license was revoked friday in the case of a teenager who planned to have an abortion but instead gave birth to a baby she says was killed when clinic staffers put it into a plastic bag and threw it in the trash			1
@entity17 - @entity16 , right , and his attorney , @entity18 , at the hearing			2
the doctor , @entity20 , was not present when the baby was born , but the @entity22 upheld @entity24 allegations that he falsified medical records , inappropriately delegated tasks to unlicensed personnel and committed malpractice			1
@entity18 , the attorney representing @entity20 at the license revocation hearing in @entity30 , said @entity20 has not decided whether to appeal			0
the state attorney 's office , meanwhile , said its criminal investigation into the incident is ongoing and no charges have been filed			1
a fetus born alive can not be put to death even if its mother intended to have an abortion , police said when the incident occurred in 2006			1
the baby 's mother , @entity41 , sued @entity20 , the clinic and its staff in january , seeking damages			1
she alleges in her suit that " she witnessed the murder of her daughter " and said she " sustained severe emotional distress , shock and psychic trauma which have resulted in discernible bodily injury			0
" " this is not about a pot of gold , " said @entity54 , her attorney			0
" what this is about is right and wrong and making a statement , making sure it does n't happen to other young women			1
" according to the suit , @entity41 , then 18 , discovered while being treated for a fall that she was 23 weeks pregnant			0
she went to a clinic to get an abortion on the morning of july 20 , 2006 , after receiving medication and instructions the previous day			1
@entity20 was not at the clinic , however , and @entity41 was told to wait for him			0
she was given two pills and told they would make her ill. when she complained of feeling ill , clinic staff members gave her a robe and told her to lie down in a patient room , the suit says			1
@entity20 was still not present when @entity41 " felt a large pain " and delivered a baby girl , according to the suit			1
" the staff began screaming and pandemonium ensued			0
@entity41 watched in horror and shock as her baby writhed with her chest rising and falling as she breathed			1
" a clinic co-owner entered the room and used a pair of shears to cut the baby 's umbilical cord , the suit said			1
she " then scooped up the baby and placed the live baby , placenta and afterbirth in a red plastic biohazard bag , which she sealed , and then threw bag and the baby in a trash can			1
" staff at the clinic did not call 911 or seek medical assistance for @entity41 or the baby , the suit said			1
@entity20 arrived at the clinic about an hour later and gave @entity41 a shot to put her to sleep			1
" she awoke after the procedure and was sent home still in complete shock , " the suit said			0
police were notified of the incident by an anonymous caller who told them the baby was born alive and disposed of			2
" the complainant [ @entity41 ] observed the baby moving and gasping for air for approximately five minutes , " according to a police affidavit requesting a search warrant for the clinic			2
two search warrants found nothing , but officers executing a third warrant " found the decomposing body of a baby in a cardboard box in a closet , " the suit said			2
the baby was linked to @entity41 through dna testing , the lawsuit said			2
an autopsy showed it had filled its lungs with air prior to death			0
documents from the @entity141 said its cause of death was determined to be " extreme prematurity			0
" fewer than 1 percent of babies are born at less than 28 weeks , according to the @entity147 , a nonprofit organization aimed at reducing premature births , birth defects and infant mortality			2
infants born at that stage may survive , but require treatment with oxygen , other medical help and mechanical assistance to help them breathe			0
they are too immature to suck or swallow and so must be fed intravenously			0
babies born before about 32 weeks of gestation face the highest risk of health problems , the @entity147 said			0
@entity41 ' lawsuit seeks damages from @entity20 , the clinic and its staff			0
it claims that clinic records were falsified to say only that @entity41 underwent an abortion			1
@entity41 filed the suit individually and " as personal representative of the estate of @entity172 , deceased , " the suit said			0
the medical board 's action friday came at the request of the @entity1 @entity141 , which filed an order in february 2007 seeking emergency restrictions on @entity20 's license			1
department documents list many of the same allegations as @entity41 ' lawsuit			0
" dr. @entity20 's failure to practice medicine with that level of care , skill and treatment that is recognized as being acceptable , as well as his willingness to falsify medical records , poses a serious and immediate danger to the public , " the health department said			2
@entity20 did not respond to the health department or dispute the facts it alleged , department spokeswoman @entity192 said friday			0
@entity41 has declined to speak publicly about the case , said @entity54 , her attorney			2
she suffers from post-traumatic stress because of the experience , he said .			0
