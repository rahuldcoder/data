-- thousands have died in the current @entity3 outbreak in @entity4 , and much of the global conversation has centered on the lack of an approved medication to treat the deadly disease			1
yet in 2013 , 1.5 million people died from another infectious disease that has a cure			1
on wednesday , the @entity12 released its 2014 @entity13 , which shows that 9 million people developed tuberculosis in 2013 and 1.5 million died , making it one of the world 's deadliest communicable diseases			1
" in addition , around 3 million people who fall ill from @entity20 are still being ' missed ' by health systems each year either because they are not diagnosed , or because they are diagnosed but not reported , " the @entity12 said in a statement			1
@entity20 , commonly called @entity20 , is a bacterial infection that can be spread through the air			1
the bacteria usually attack patients ' lungs but can also hit the kidney , spine and brain			0
@entity20 can be fatal , according to the @entity32 , but it does n't have to be			2
four drug regimens are approved to treat @entity20 ; the bacteria can usually be conquered by taking a mix of medications for six to nine months			1
more than 700 infants exposed to @entity20 in @entity38 the prevalence rate of @entity20 has fallen 41 % since 1990			2
but given the fact " that most deaths from @entity20 are preventable , the death toll from the disease is still unacceptably high and efforts to combat it must be accelerated , " the @entity12 report authors write			1
part of the reason so many are dying from tuberculosis is that a strain of the bacteria has become resistant to treatment			0
about 3.5 % of the people who were diagnosed with @entity20 in 2013 had this form of the disease , according to the @entity12			1
but that 's only 3.5 %			0
another reason is lack of funding , the @entity12 says			2
about $ 8 billion is needed each year for a " full response , " the agency says , but just over $ 6 billion is allocated			0
this money shortage plays into what is probably the top reason many people with tuberculosis are not being treated : the majority of cases are found in @entity69 and the @entity70			2
another quarter are found in @entity4 , which has the highest prevalence and death rate			0
many people in these regions simply do n't have access to quality health care			0
" pharmaceutical industries are less interested in diseases in developing countries where potential gains are limited , " said dr. @entity78 , director of @entity12 's @entity79			0
" as a result , we have a problem ( with tuberculosis ) because people know that 95 % of cases are in developing countries			0
" there are 15 tuberculosis vaccines being tested in clinical trials around the world , according to the @entity12 report			1
an effective vaccine could be a way to stop the epidemic for good			0
