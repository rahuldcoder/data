video gamers spend tons of time -- for many it 's 10,000 hours by age 21 -- battling mythic monsters , shooting aliens and rescuing princesses from digital castles			0
@entity9 wants to put those efforts to better use			2
the @entity13 computer scientist is the creator of two online games -- @entity15 and @entity16 -- that put video gamers to work solving epic scientific puzzles			1
his aim is to make super-boring - sounding scientific mysteries like " protein folding " and " rna synthesis " fun and challenging for gamers			0
the results have been staggering , as @entity15 and @entity16 players -- there are about 430,000 of them between those two games , most of them playing @entity15 -- continue to make discoveries that had eluded scientists and their supercomputers			1
earlier this month , for example , @entity15 players helped solve a puzzle about proteins that could further research into hiv / aids			1
their work was co-published in the journal @entity40			0
players know they 're working on science puzzles , but the games are meant to be fun			1
" one of our goals when we made @entity15 is to make proteins toy - like , which is actually a technical term from game design , " @entity9 said in a recent interview at the @entity47 conference			1
" it should be something you want to play with , like a @entity55 or a @entity56			0
" proteins are these esoteric things that most people do n't know very much about , but through computer graphics and interaction we were able to make them something you can play with and wiggle and pull -- and make them physically real for people			0
and i think that realness -- that toy - like aspect of proteins -- is what made it ultimately comprehensible to our players , and allowed them to solve problems that elude computer programs			1
" to get why this is significant you have to understand a little bit about proteins , which @entity9 describes as building blocks for life			2
if scientists can better understand the shapes of proteins , they can do more to build them themselves , which could lead to new methods of disease prevention and treatment			0
but they need help figuring out how to use these tools			0
" we 're building with , like , completely new materials , " he said , " so we know how to build with hammers but we do n't know how to build with @entity92 and @entity93 yet			0
" that 's where the games come in			0
gamers essentially are teaching scientists and computers how to build with genetic code , by toying with the shapes of @entity102 and proteins to see what works best			1
in @entity15 , they 're awarded points for making proteins that use the least amount of energy			1
in @entity16 , which launched earlier this year , a @entity109 lab actually will create a picture of the sequences made in the game			1
" when you create a molecule in the game we actually synthesize it -- we make it for real and we send you back pictures of what you 've made , " he said			2
here 's more on how that game works : " what we actually do is give the players very simple tasks like build a circle , build a star , " he said			2
" these are tasks that are beyond the limits of science today , but through trial and error and being able to play with real molecules through this computer game , people have been able to figure out how to solve these tasks , which is sort of extraordinary			1
" @entity9 has high hopes for gaming 's potential to unlock good in humanity -- and impact the real world			2
" people can solve much more complex problems online at the edge of human knowledge , " he said in a @entity47 speech , " and i think we 've just scratched the surface			0

@entity9 , a computer scientist , designs games that further science
in @entity15 , players mold @entity149 models of *protiens* as if they 're puzzles
another game , @entity16 , lets players toy with genetic sequences
@entity9 : gamers have made discoveries that elude scientists and computers
