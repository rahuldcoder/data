-- for actor @entity2 , it was an unpaid gig starring in a @entity4 - only video that 's just two minutes long			1
an @entity5 and a @entity6 later , he says " @entity8 " is the best job he 's ever taken			1
" it changed my career , " @entity2 said			2
" i 'm doing feature after feature			2
i 'm doing four in a row right now , and that 's all because of the reaction to ' @entity16 '			2
" the personalized , interactive video took the web by storm last @entity20			1
in it , @entity2 plays a disturbed - looking stalker who paws through @entity25 photos and other information the viewer provides before jumping in a car and driving in a twisted rage toward the address that the user has posted right there on the internet for anyone to see			2
as of wednesday , the video had been " liked " on @entity25 more than 13.9 million times			1
director @entity37 says it 's been watched more than 100 million times total , and its 10 million likes in less than a month made it the fastest - spreading app in @entity25 's history , according to @entity43			1
and now ? like any good horror outing , it 's getting a sequel			1
@entity37 hopes to launch " @entity47 " by @entity20			1
he 's started a @entity49 campaign , hoping that some of the millions of people he freaked out last year will help him do it again			1
" the people were such a huge part of making the first one so successful -- there was really nothing else that made it successful other than people talking about it and people writing about it , " he said			2
" thirteen million peopled ' liked ' the original one			2
if we just got 150,000 of those people to give a dollar to say they liked the first one and want to see a second one ... it 's such an interesting concept to see that 's all it takes			2
" " @entity16 " clearly touched a nerve			0
in it , @entity37 ( whose viral - video pedigree began with 2006 's interactive " @entity76 " ) merged @entity78 's disturbing screen persona with the public 's mounting concerns about @entity25 security and online privacy in general			1
it would go on to shock even its creators by winning a @entity5 for " @entity85 " as well as a pair of @entity6			0
" you always have that thing in your mind where you hope what you 're doing is going to be successful , but i never had any clue it would be this successful , " @entity37 said			1
" winning the @entity5 was probably the most remote thing i could have put into my head			0
" @entity2 says he sees the video 's wide reach in his daily life			2
" particularly if i 'm wearing a wife - beater ( t - shirt ) , which is frequent in @entity100 because it 's hot , " he said			0
" i 've actually had kids say , ' @entity103 , that 's the guy who stalked me on @entity25 ! ' the kids think it 's funny			0
the adults are freaked out by it			0
" @entity2 is already a bit of a b - movie regular , with appearances ranging from @entity113 's " @entity112 " to the provocatively titled " @entity111			0
" but he credits the video with helping him emerge as something of a cult favorite			2
( " i 'm killing a guy in a bathtub today , " he says by phone during a break in shooting an upcoming feature )			0
" it became worldwide , " he said			0
" i went from just trying to work to someone who was described , whether accurately or not , as an emerging horror icon on sites in @entity126 and @entity127			0
i owe @entity37 and his team a great debt because , basically that 's a two - minute reel for what i do on film			1
" @entity37 is being understandably tight - lipped about details of the sequel			1
" part of what made the first one really successful was the idea that your friend told you to do this , but really did n't give you too much information , " he said			0
" a lot of the word of mouth was , ' @entity146 , this is the scariest thing i 've ever seen , ' but a lot of people did n't really tell people what happens before they saw it			0
" he promises it will again be interactive and be " bigger " than the original			1
" we want to take it a step further , " @entity37 said			1
" we think there 's an interesting story we 're developing that , if you spoiled some of the details , would spoil some of the experience			0
" he wo n't even officially confirm whether @entity2 will be back , although he quickly acknowledges that he " could n't imagine him not being a part of it			0
" and @entity49 supporters can be part of the action			0
donor levels range from $ 1 to $ 10 ( which gets you the iconic blue lollipop featured on the original video , sans razor blade ) all the way up to a whopping $ 10,000 , at which point the campaign ominously promises " an extended film experience that begins to infiltrate your real life			1
" for a more meager $ 2,500 , you can have a photograph of yourself included in the film			0
" we wanted to come up with some inventive ways of letting people be a part of it , " @entity37 said			1
" if , for whatever reason , it ends up being seen by as many people as the first one , you can be part of it			0
