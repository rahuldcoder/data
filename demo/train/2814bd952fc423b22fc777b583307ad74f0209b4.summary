@entity0 -- relaxing on his couch , @entity2 quickly scans the channel guide on the tv , his @entity7 bulldog resting at his feet , before landing on a football game			1
weekends were much different for @entity2 a few years ago			1
" my job on sundays is to find a place inside of me , to be furious , to be angry , to be violent , " he said			2
" i better be ready to go out there and knock somebody 's head off			2
" as a running back in the @entity18 , @entity2 did whatever it took to prove himself because he always knew his job was up for grabs			1
and his hard work paid off			0
@entity2 , now 34 , was a standout at the @entity22 , and he went on to play 12 seasons in the @entity18 and earn a coveted spot in the league 's elite 10,000 @entity25			1
despite his love for the gridiron , the coal miner 's son knows there 's a dark side to the sport			0
" in the @entity18 , yeah , we 're making a lot of money			1
but the reality is , you 're taking a chance on your life as well , " he said			0
" people love to see someone get knocked out			0
but no one 's there when they have a concussion			0
" a tale of two former @entity18 players and their brains it 's something that weighs on @entity2 , who retired from the @entity18 in 2011 after playing 12 seasons for five different teams			1
still nimble , @entity2 does n't experience chronic headaches or have memory trouble			1
he even considers himself less irritable nowadays than when he was playing			0
although his daily life is n't riddled with pain resulting from repeated pummeling , he is concerned about the long - term effects of the sport on his brain			2
that concern grew after talking to doctors and players haunted by gnarly hits for a six - part documentary series , " the @entity18 : the @entity65 , " which he is producing			1
@entity18 , @entity66 planning $ 100 million player study he felt his worries were founded when he learned that star nfl linebacker @entity69 -- who took his own life last may -- suffered from a neurodegenerative brain disease that can develop from concussions known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy or @entity74			1
at that point , @entity2 said he decided to donate his own brain to the @entity77 -- which studies the link between sports and brain trauma -- for research upon his death			1
@entity2 said he hopes that research will help bring more understanding of the brain disease so future football players are informed when they decide to take the field			1
" @entity74 did n't just pop up			0
it 's been around , " he said			0
" but unfortunately it took a couple of big - name guys to take their own lives to bring attention to it			2
" seven months after @entity69 's death , another @entity18 player 's life came to a violent end , stunning the sports world once again and raising concerns about the mental health of football players			1
on december 1 , @entity104 linebacker @entity103 fatally shot his girlfriend in the same home as their 3 - month - old daughter before heading to team 's practice facility , thanking his coaches , and turning his gun on himself			0
yet , in the wake of @entity103 's murder - suicide , the nationwide discussion turned away from mental health and toward guns			0
@entity119 sportscaster @entity118 fueled the firestorm with his comments just one day after the incident			0
referencing a piece written by @entity125 ' @entity124 , @entity118 said , " ' handguns do not enhance our safety , they exacerbate our flaws , tempt us to escalate arguments and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it			0
' " ' if @entity103 did n't possess a gun , he and @entity132 would both be alive today			0
' " weeks later , the gun debate would grow even louder after the @entity136 , @entity137 , school massacre			0
@entity2 -- who played with @entity103 and owns a handgun -- said there 's a much bigger picture to consider			1
" i loved @entity103 like a brother , but he did something terrible , horrible , and we ca n't take that back , " @entity2 said			1
" but to segue into ( saying there is ) a gun culture in the @entity18 ... makes me sick to my stomach			1
" @entity2 started playing football at age 7 in @entity150 , @entity151			2
the oldest of seven kids , he describes his childhood as a simple country life			0
he said his family was so big they had to make two trips to church on sundays -- half the family at a time			0
and , sometimes the family went without basic necessities , including heat			0
@entity2 stepped into a different world as a professional athlete after graduating from the @entity22 , he said , a world that has brought good fortune but one that also leaves him contemplating the future			1
since retiring from the @entity104 last season , @entity2 turned his attention to letting people know that life after football also has risks			2
he 's hopeful that the @entity18 will create new ways to make the sport safer , but , he said , " football is football , it 's a gladiator sport			2
unfortunately , that 's part of the game			0
" @entity2 said he is creating his documentary series to give viewers an insider look at @entity18 players ' lives without the helmet			1
in one scene , former @entity18 defensive end @entity189 laments about his memory loss			2
" i know my memory 's screwed up at times , i know i be forgetting things , " @entity189 says			0
" i kind of laugh it off now , but ... i hope these concussions do n't come back to haunt us in the end			2
" through this documentary , @entity2 hopes he can shed light on the human side of professional football			1
" even though we can do superhuman things , it seems , on the football field , it does n't make us superhuman off the field , " he said			0
