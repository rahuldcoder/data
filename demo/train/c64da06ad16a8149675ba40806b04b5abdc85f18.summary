-- march 1 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : you 're at the beginning of a new month , a new week and a new day of commercial - free headlines from @entity0			1
first up : @entity21 @entity22 : safety and food : top priorities in @entity4 after the country was jolted by a massive earthquake over the weekend			1
it struck very early saturday morning when most people were sleeping			1
it registered a magnitude of 8.8 ; very powerful			1
a scientist with the @entity33 says it released about 500 times more energy than the quake that hit @entity37 in january			2
more than 90 aftershocks have been recorded in @entity4 , many of those pretty powerful in their own right			1
as of yesterday evening , the quake was being blamed for more than 700 deaths			2
it affected 2 million people , caused serious damage to around half a million homes			2
@entity4 's president called it an " unthinkable disaster			1
" she declared a " state of catastrophe " in some regions that were hardest hit			2
state of catastrophe meaning that government aid is available ; it 's going to get to victims as fast as they can get it to them			1
however , the president also pointed out the recovery efforts will take quite a while			2
president @entity59 , @entity4 ( @entity61 ) : we see the size and the dimension of this catastrophe is going to require a gigantic effort from the private and public sectors , not only now , but it 's going to take us a long time in the future			1
we are in front of an emergency that has no point of reference in the past of @entity4 , in @entity4 's history			1
@entity22 : as you can see on this map coming up right here , @entity4 is a long country			1
it runs down the western side of @entity80 , along the @entity81			2
it 's home to about 16 and a half million people			1
and the coastal region actually has a history of earthquakes			2
since 1973 , there have been 13 quakes there with a magnitude of at least 7.0			2
because of that , experts say that newer buildings are built to help withstand the shocks			2
so , while the devastation caused by this quake is certainly severe , it 's part of the reason why it might not be as bad as what we saw in @entity37			1
however , the effects of this tremor were felt far away			2
in fact , the entire @entity81 was under a tsunami warning ; large waves that form in the ocean			2
they can be triggered by earthquakes			2
the warning for the tsunami , later canceled for all countries			2
but listen to this : @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 , locations that are thousands of miles away from @entity4 , all experienced waves that were triggered by this quake			1
@entity119 @entity22 : heavy snow was the big story in the northeastern @entity122 over the weekend again			1
this is the third major storm to hit the area in a month			2
and over the course of february , @entity125 set a new , all - time record for snowfall			2
this storm knocked out power to about 700,000 homes and businesses around the @entity132			2
that includes almost 225,000 in @entity125 alone			2
according to one meteorologist , another round of severe winter weather could be coming this week			2
is this legit ? @entity137 , @entity15 : is this legit ? a term in the @entity122 @entity139 lasts four years			1
nope ! a @entity139 term is two years , which means all 435 voting members are up for election this year			2
election expectations @entity22 : that election 's coming up this november ; campaign season has begun			1
@entity146 currently control both the @entity139 and @entity147			2
and here 's what @entity139 speaker @entity149 predicted about her party 's election chances : @entity149 , ( @entity153 ) @entity154 , house speaker : the democrats will retain the majority in the @entity139			1
i 'm not yielding one grain of sand			2
we 're fighting for every seat , but we are ready			2
@entity22 : meantime , senate minority leader @entity162 talked about @entity164 chances : sen. @entity162 , ( r ) @entity165 , @entity166 : obviously , we 're optimistic			0
but in the meantime , we need to be doing the people 's business and not trying to predict what the environment may be in november			1
if the election were today , we 'd have a very good day			1
@entity22 : and here 's what registered voters said in a recent @entity176 : 63 percent felt that most members of @entity178 do n't deserve to be re-elected ; 34 percent said they do			1
@entity179 @entity22 : @entity179 shows with orca , or killer , whales are back on again			0
the shows were suspended for three days after an accident involving one of the animals at the @entity179			0
it claimed the life of a trainer , @entity189			0
the theme park , as well as two government agencies , are looking into this accident			0
meantime , @entity179 is putting new policies in place with regard to how trainers interact with the whales			0
hundreds of people attended the orca show in @entity5 on saturday , the first one since the accident			0
it began with a tribute to @entity189 and a standing ovation for her fellow trainers			0
some of the visitors who were there for the show talked about the experience			0
@entity210 # 1 : i think it was great that they moved forward			0
i wished they would have said a little bit more , actually , about it , what had happened and what was going to happen			0
because obviously everyone there was anxious and curious about what the future is			0
@entity210 # 2 : it was n't a happy atmosphere			0
we all stood up for the remembrance and we cheered the trainers			0
this day in history [ @entity229 ] @entity230 -- incident involved accusations of witchcraft			0
first charges issued on march 1 , 1692			0
in all , 150 people imprisoned ; 19 convicted and hanged			0
[ @entity229 ] @entity236 -- established by president @entity237 march 1 , 1961			0
promotes world peace and friendship			0
volunteers work in developing countries			0
nearly 200,000 volunteers and trainees to date			0
record setting medals @entity22 : and some more history being made in @entity247 as the @entity122 racks up the most medals ever by one country in a @entity250			1
37 total medals , when you add up gold , silver and bronze			0
this also marks the first time since 1932 that the @entity122 has been first place in the overall medal count at a @entity250			1
adopt a @entity260 ? @entity22 : all right , our next story today is about owning a cat ; it 's not so unusual			1
some people might have a chance to adopt a rare breed , though , thanks to a plan being considered by @entity7			0
the thing is , these cats weigh up to 500 pounds ! that 's ' cause they 're tigers ! and all you need to get one is a big chunk of money			1
as @entity278 explains , some people are concerned about the consequences of this			0
( begin video ) @entity278 , @entity282 , @entity283 : ever dream of owning a tiger ? if you are in @entity7 , it just might be possible			0
these @entity288 tigers at the safari park outside of @entity283 could soon be up for adoption			1
it 's part of a conservation initiative the government is considering			1
for a $ 100,000 deposit , ordinary citizens would be allowed to care for a pair of these critically endangered wild cats in their own backyard , as long as it 's at least a tenth the size of a football field			1
@entity302 , @entity7 director general , @entity304 [ @entity61 ] : we hope that this program will help to eradicate poaching , because in @entity7 or abroad , a lot of people want to have tigers as pets			1
but because it 's illegal , they go and buy dead tigers			1
@entity315 : with this option , @entity318 says , the ones in the wild will be left alone			0
illegal poaching and an 80 percent loss of tiger habitat in @entity323 has caused their numbers in the wild to dwindle down to a few hundred			0
these guys do look like they would make absolutely adorable pets right now			1
but they 're not going to stay this small or this cuddly for long			0
officials are saying that they do believe that this program will be successful , because it 's based on a similar initiative that they launched earlier for the @entity336 mynah bird that was on the verge of extinction			1
problem is , caring for a bird the size of a pidgeon and caring for a tiger , not exactly the same thing			0
now , they are very small			0
@entity346 : yes , very small			0
@entity315 : in nine months , they will be this big			0
the keepers were all stunned to hear that their tigers could end up as household pets			1
the keepers here go through a rigorous training program , @entity353 explains			1
the government says it 's planning on assigning keepers to each pair that is adopted			1
conservationists say animals like these belong in the wild , not as a backyard symbol of prestige			0
@entity278 , @entity0 , @entity365 , @entity7			0
( @entity366 ) @entity367 @entity22 : under consideration in @entity370 : an optional senior year ; letting high school students graduate as juniors			1
not a popular idea with some students , but it would save the school money , something you are constantly hearing about in this recession			1
we want to hear what you 've seen in your school			1
field trips canceled ? bigger class sizes ? tell us at @entity384			0
before we go @entity22 : before we go , you better watch your mouth ! especially if you live in @entity154			0
what the ... ? ! ? the @entity388 has passed a resolution that would make the first week of march " @entity390			0
" a time to silence the swears			0
police officers wo n't be washing out anybody 's mouth with soap			1
the idea is just to make things a little more polite , even if it 's only for a few days			1
this was actually inspired by a student			0
goodbye @entity22 : he started the no cussing idea in his school , but lawmakers swear it can work for the state			0
okay , we can bleep today 's pun on air			1
but our transcript includes every word we say			0
so if you were to go to , say , @entity384 , for example , no one could stop you from finding out what we said			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity20 .			0

assess the impact of a massive earthquake that struck in @entity4
hear predictions from both parties about @entity122 *midterm* elections
consider an adoption program that could turn tigers into pets
