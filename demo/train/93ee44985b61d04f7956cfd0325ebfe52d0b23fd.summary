-- in two weeks , economic policymakers from around the world will gather in @entity3 , for the @entity4			1
as has been the case for the past five years , there will be much talk of economic crisis and of strategies to restore confidence , kick start growth , and create jobs			1
there is growing evidence that we are on the right track , but this agenda still requires much more work			1
the meetings , though , also offer an occasion to look beyond the short term crisis - fighting measures			0
it is a chance for leaders to adopt a long - term perspective and assess where we stand and where we are headed			0
if they do , they will see that today we are at a moment of historic opportunity			1
for the end of absolute poverty , a dream which has enticed and driven humanity for centuries , is now within our grasp			1

on the strength of robust private sector growth underpinned by improved economic governance , today extreme poverty is in retreat across the developing world			1
in 1990 , 43 % of the developing world lived on less than $ 1.25 a day			0
the @entity54 estimates that by 2010 this figure had dropped to 21 %			1
the first @entity56 , to halve extreme poverty , was achieved five years ahead of time			1
as we look forward , while we of course can not take high growth for granted , the conditions are in place for this strong performance to continue			2
indeed , the successes of past decades and an increasingly favorable economic outlook combine to give developing countries a chance -- for the first time ever -- to end extreme poverty within a generation			1
our collective duty now must be to ensure that these favorable circumstances are matched with deliberate decisions to realize this remarkable opportunity			0

this feasible but ambitious goal should bring unity , urgency , and energy to our collective efforts in the fight against poverty			1
meeting this deadline will require strong , stable growth across the developing world , especially in @entity77 and @entity90			1
it will require policies to enhance inclusiveness and prevent increases in inequality , and ensure that growth translates into poverty reduction , most importantly through creating jobs			2
it will require transformational changes in fragile states , which are home to an increasing share of the world 's poor			0
and it will require that potential shocks , such as climatic disasters or new fuel , food , or financial crises , are averted or mitigated			0
it will not be easy , and will demand concerted global action from governments , donors , civil society , and the private sector			0
but is there anyone , anywhere , who doubts that the reward will be worth it ? read more : study shows speed of global warming of course progress toward ending poverty will need to be sustained over time and for all future generations			2
we must promote shared prosperity , helping vulnerable people so that they will not fall back into poverty			0
and , crucially unless the world takes bold action now , a disastrously warming planet threatens to reverse past advances			0
climate change is not just an environmental challenge : it is a fundamental threat to economic development and the fight against poverty			2
at the @entity143 we have no pretence that we will be the key actor in ending poverty			0
progress toward this goal , as it always has , will continue to depend primarily on the actions of developing countries			0
but we will be there to help			0
we will work with our partners to share knowledge on solutions to end poverty			1
we will closely monitor and observe progress toward this goal , reporting annually on what has been achieved and where gaps remain			2
and we will use our convening and advocacy power to continually remind policymakers and the international community what is at stake			0
by acting today , there is an opportunity to create a world for our children which is defined not by stark inequities but by soaring opportunities			2
we can and must achieve a world free of poverty			2
