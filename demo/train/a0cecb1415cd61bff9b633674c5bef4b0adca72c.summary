@entity0 -- @entity3 's best - known judge , @entity2 , went on trial tuesday in @entity0 for the second time in two weeks , accused of abusing his judicial authority during his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of @entity3 's @entity9			1
a seven - judge panel at @entity3 's @entity13 is hearing the case , a week after a different seven - judge panel at the same court conducted the first trial against @entity2 , for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a financial corruption case			1
@entity2 , 56 , was suspended from his post in 2010 , pending these trials			2
if convicted , he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in @entity3			2
many observers said the second trial is the most important against @entity2 , who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former @entity27 dictator @entity26 , who was in a @entity29 hospital			1
@entity2 accused him of the murder of @entity3 in @entity27 and crimes of genocide			1
@entity34 of @entity35 said the trial against @entity2 for his @entity9 investigation " is the first time in a consolidated democracy " and in the @entity41 that a judge " is indicted for investigating human rights abuses			1
" " @entity2 is being tried for trying to apply in @entity3 the same principles he applied internationally			1
a democracy needs judges who are n't afraid , " @entity34 told a news conference in @entity0 on monday , flanked by other international observers who are attending the trial			2
in both cases , state prosecutors have asked that all charges be dropped			0
but under @entity3 law , a private prosecution is also allowed and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against @entity2			1
last week 's trial in the so - called @entity60 financial and political corruption case lasted three days and the seven - judge panel must now determine a verdict			1
in the case tuesday involving the @entity9 regime , a small civil servants union called @entity66 , or clean hands , brought charges against @entity2 , saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in @entity3 parliament , two years after @entity9 's death			1
" @entity72 unanimously approved the amnesty law			0
judge @entity2 takes a stance as if they 're crazy			2
what does he think ? that he 's better than them ? " said @entity77 , leader of @entity66			0
@entity77 denies critics ' charges that his group is a tiny far - right front , but he told @entity1 he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the @entity84			0
@entity2 said in may 2010 , at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the @entity89 , " i face this calmly , with the tranquility of knowing that i am innocent of these charges			2
" @entity9 's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three - year @entity94			2
the war ended when @entity9 's forces emerged victorious over @entity98 and leftist fighters			0
@entity9 's dictatorship continued until his death in 1975			0
mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed			0
just outside the courtroom on tuesday before the proceedings began , @entity2 told @entity1 he is " okay " as he heads into this second trial			2
he talked with his lawyers and supporters , smiled broadly and appeared relaxed			0
outside the courthouse , several hundred people demonstrated in favor of @entity2 , a far larger crowd than at the start of last week 's trial			1
inside the ornate 18th - century @entity13 building , various people , still looking for the remains of their relatives in mass graves from the @entity118 , filed into the courtroom , right next to @entity120			0
but the two opposing groups apparently did not recognize each other , and there were no apparent verbal exchanges			0
the trial opened with preliminary issues , in which @entity2 's defense lawyer called for the case to be thrown out			1
among the questions was whether a case like this could go forward when not the state prosecutor but only a private prosecution is bringing the charges			0
in the financial corruption case that @entity2 was investigating , and which still has ongoing trials against defendants in various parts of @entity3 , @entity2 ordered electronic surveillance against some defendants being held in jail , and some of their conversations were with their lawyers			1
these lawyers later filed charges against @entity2 , saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in ordering the wiretaps on their conversations in prison and also violated their constitutional rights			1
during the trial , @entity2 said his orders did not breach their attorney - client privilege and that the electronic surveillance was supported by prosecutors			1
it was done , @entity2 said , on suspicion that the defendants in the corruption scandal were engaged in money laundering , even while they were in preventative prison			0
lawyers for the financial corruption defendants called on the court to clearly delimit how far a judge could go in investigating alleged crimes			0
@entity2 spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the @entity89 , which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases			0
he has investigated the @entity171 leader @entity170 , the @entity173 terrorist group @entity174 , and drug traffickers			0
at times in the past , @entity2 has been considered a darling of the @entity3 right or the @entity3 left , depending on the cases he was investigating			2
his critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras			0
since his suspension in 2010 , @entity2 has been working as a legal adviser outside of @entity3 on human rights cases and judicial issues , including in @entity189			1
a third case against @entity2 , for alleged judicial improprieties linked to his organization of some courses at @entity193 that had major @entity3 corporations as sponsors , is still in the investigation phase and no trial date has been set			1
in that case as well , @entity3 prosecutors have not pressed charges but a private prosecution has .			0

@entity3 's best - known judge is on trial for the second time in two weeks
a judges ' panel has yet to rule after last week 's trial
@entity2 is accused of abusing his judicial authority
the second trial is thought by many to be more important
