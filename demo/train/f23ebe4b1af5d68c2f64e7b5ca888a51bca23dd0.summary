@entity1 president @entity13 reaffirmed his commitment to transparency and human rights in his offensive against the cartels , @entity3 said			1
some $ 100 million in anti-drug aid , known as the @entity21 , could be delayed because of concerns about human rights violations , it was reported last week			1

" the three @entity32 countries depend on their borders being safe and secure , @entity3 said , adding that he supports " orderly and legal " migration , while respecting the @entity32 tradition of welcoming immigrants			1
he also responded to critics who say that the @entity4 has not been forceful enough in demanding the return of ousted @entity50 president @entity49 to power , calling them hypocritical			1
" the same critics who say that the @entity4 has not intervened enough in @entity50 , are the same people who say that we 're always intervening and that @entity54 need to get out of @entity55			1
you ca n't have it both ways , " @entity3 said			2
" we have been very clear in our belief that president @entity49 was removed from office illegally , that it was a coup , and that he should return , " @entity3 said			2
the @entity63 and @entity64 , including the @entity4 , have called for @entity49 's return , but more than one month later , the interim government of @entity67 remains firm and talks between the two sides have so far been unsuccessful			2
@entity33 agreed with @entity3 's stance			0
the @entity4 has very clearly stated its position while letting a multilateral process take the lead , he said			0
" that 's precisely what we want to see from the @entity4 , " @entity33 said			0

@entity3 told journalists that @entity33 has raised the issue every time they have met			0
@entity33 has complained the " @entity80 " provision is protectionist and could harm trade relations between the closely linked @entity32 economies			0
" this in no way this has endangered the billions of dollars of trade taking place between our two countries , " @entity3 said , standing beside @entity33 and @entity13 at a final news conference			0
@entity33 responded to the same question by saying the leaders had a good discussion on the issue , and their respective trade ministers also were talking about it			0
@entity34 is the top trade partner of the @entity4 , with cross-border commerce worth more than $ 1 billion a day			1
the $ 787 - billion stimulus package enacted in february included a provision that only @entity32 goods be used in stimulus projects			0
it also stipulated that the measure would not override existing @entity4 trade treaties such as the @entity111			0
@entity3 also talked about comparisons between the @entity4 and @entity34 health care systems , saying @entity34 's government - run health care model wo n't work in the @entity4			1
" we 've got to develop a uniquely @entity32 approach to this problem , " he said			0
opponents of health care legislation in the @entity121 and @entity122 say it will lead to a single - payer system like the government - run program in @entity34 , with some warning the @entity34 system means restrictions on treatments and long delays			0
@entity3 noted the @entity4 system is based on employers providing health insurance for most @entity4			2
throwing that out would be too radical an overhaul , he said			0
however , he said he expects opponents of health care legislation to continue to make what he called the misleading comparison between proposed @entity4 legislation and @entity34 's system			1
" i suspect that you @entity34 are going to continue to get dragged into the debate , " he said .			0
