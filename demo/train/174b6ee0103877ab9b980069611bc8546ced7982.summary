forensic tests have found the blood of @entity2 on the gun , uniform and police cruiser belonging to officer @entity6 , who fatally shot the unarmed teen two months ago in @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity10 reported			1
the revelation , provided by unnamed government officials familiar with a federal civil rights investigation , marked the first public account of @entity6 's testimony to investigators			1
that it could potentially serve as exculpatory evidence -- or at the very least , used by @entity6 's supporters to back the officer 's account of what transpired on @entity23 on august 9 -- immediately drew suspicion and anger from leading activists who portended an ominous reaction from @entity2 supporters			1
" this is clearly constructed and contrived to justify the killing of @entity32 , " @entity8 resident @entity28 told @entity30 affiliate @entity29			0
@entity33 , a @entity8 resident who was among activists meeting with @entity36 attorney general @entity35 there in august , found the newspaper account of @entity6 's testimony " so hard to believe			1
" she said the report addressed only the initial encounter and not the subsequent fatal shooting , when some witnesses said @entity2 was surrendering with his hands up			1
but police said @entity6 shot @entity2 after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun			2
@entity33 speculated that the account was leaked to the newspaper because a @entity51 grand jury investigating the teen 's killing is now leaning toward not indicting the officer			1
" if [ @entity2 ] struggled with this officer , this still does not justify why this child is not alive , " @entity33 said			1
" if this young man did this , and struggled , that means he got free			0
and then witnesses said he turned around with his hands up			0
this kid should still be alive			0
" there was speculation probably about a week ago , that @entity6 will not be indicted , and that he is going to get off			0
people are more angry now			0
there 's more anger now than when the incident happened , " @entity33 continued			0
@entity33 worried whether the revelation would provoke another round of racially charged protests akin to the violent demonstrations immediately after @entity2 's august 9 death in the @entity75 suburb			1
@entity6 is white ; @entity2 was black			2
" this is not a black and white thing , this is about what 's right and wrong			0
@entity75 is in trouble , because if this is what @entity6 said , and they believe him , @entity75 is going to burn , " @entity33 said			1
" i 'm so frustrated with this			0
it 's all for political gain			0
it 's become no longer about @entity32 , " @entity33 added			0
the officer 's account @entity6 , 28 , a resident of the @entity75 area , has stayed out of the spotlight since the incident , and until now , few details have emerged publicly about his side of the story			1
@entity6 told investigators he was trying to leave his car when @entity2 shoved him back in , the @entity10 reported friday night			2
once in , @entity2 pinned him in his car and tried to get his gun , which made him fear for his safety , the newspaper reported , citing unnamed government officials familiar with the federal civil rights case			1
the officer told authorities that @entity2 hit him and scratched him repeatedly , leaving bruises on his face and neck , according to @entity108			1
analyst : " helpful testimony " for officer @entity30 legal analyst @entity112 said the new account appears to be " strong evidence " favoring the officer , but " the real focus on the case will shift to what happened outside of the car when @entity2 ran away , according to many witnesses , " @entity112 said			1
" i think the focus will shift on the officer , " @entity112 said			0
" he is not out of the woods yet , even though this is helpful testimony for him			2
" the officer will claim here that because @entity2 tried to kill him with his gun ... he was a danger to the public and to the officer in general , " @entity112 said			1
" however , if , as some witnesses have said , @entity2 turned with his hands up in a surrender gesture , well , then he 's no longer a threat to anybody and he can not be shot			1
" the officer may be saying , well , that is not what 's happening			2
he was running towards me and trying to tackle me and he constitutes a continuing threat to my safety			0
so it will depend on what the grand jury believes which is the accurate version , " @entity112 said			0
@entity144 fired twice in car @entity148 forensic tests showed the gun was fired twice in the car , with one bullet hitting @entity2 's arm while the second one missed , the newspaper said			1
in addition to @entity6 's uniform and gun , forensic tests found the teen 's blood on the interior door panel of his car , the @entity10 said			0
his account did not include an explanation on why he shot at @entity2 even after they got out of the car , according to @entity108			1
a preliminary autopsy showed the teen was shot at least six times , including twice in the head			0
separate federal and local investigations are still ongoing , but the government officials said the evidence so far does not indicate that the officer violated any civil rights , the @entity10 reported			1
@entity30 can not confirm the details of the @entity10 ' report			0
a grand jury is considering whether @entity6 should be tried on other charges			0
what happened in the car mostly a mystery most of the accounts of @entity2 's shooting have focused on what happened outside the car -- on the street -- with conflicting narratives between both sides			1
@entity187 , 22 , who was walking with @entity2 on the street when the shooting occurred , told @entity30 that the officer pulled up and told them to get on the sidewalk			1
they told him they were almost home , and would be off the street shortly			0
the officer drove forward , but stopped and backed up , almost hitting the pair , @entity187 said			0
" we were so close , almost inches away , that when he tried to open his door aggressively , the door ricocheted both off me and @entity202 's body and closed back on the officer , " he said			2
witnesses ' version a stark contrast still in his car , the officer grabbed @entity2 by his neck , but he tried to pull away as the officer pulled him toward him , @entity187 said			2
the officer drew his weapon and fired , hitting @entity2 , @entity187 said			2
a bloodied @entity2 took off running , but the officer followed him and fired , according to @entity187			2
@entity2 turned around with his hands up and told the officer he was unarmed , but the officer fired and the teen hit the ground , @entity187 said			2
another witness , @entity220 , has said she saw @entity6 and @entity2 " tussling through the window " of the police cruiser			2
complete coverage of @entity8 shooting and protests			0
