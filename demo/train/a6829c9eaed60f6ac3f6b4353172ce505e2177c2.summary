-- back in 2005 , when he stopped studying third down tendencies long enough to work on a motivational self - help book , @entity1 kept hammering on one phrase			1
the book 's title was " how good do you want to be ? a champion 's tips on how to lead and succeed at @entity10			0
" the phrase the @entity13 's football coach was stuck on was mercifully shorter			1
" the clutter is you			0
the clutter is this story , another horn in the vast media brass section trumpeting a college football game taking on @entity25 proportions			1
" it 's everything out there that can take away from your focus , " said @entity1 's co-writer , @entity26			1
this week @entity1 -- called " the most powerful coach in sports " by @entity33 in 2008 -- is up to his furrowed brow in clutter			1
his no. 2 @entity36 plays no. 1 @entity38 saturday night in @entity40 , @entity36 , in the most anticipated college football game in years			1
both teams are undefeated , and it 's the first ever @entity44 regular season game matching the country 's two top teams			1
@entity47 : @entity48 vs. @entity36 really does mean everything to some , and that 's ok @entity1 , who just turned 60 , is not exactly a willing contributor to the ruckus that surrounds big - time college football			1
when his own players doused him with the traditional @entity57 victory shower after @entity36 won the @entity58 in january , 2010 , he looked genuinely irked by the display			1
@entity1 's no - nonsense nature -- he and a statue of him outside @entity36 's football stadium are tied for number of memorable one - liners -- perfectly equips him for a moment like saturday night			1
" it 's fun to play in games like this , " @entity1 said this week			1
and then he broke out the wet blanket			0
" but i also think it 's important to be able to stay focused on what you need to do to play well			0
you ca n't drain yourself emotionally because of all the things that are happening surrounding the game			0
" @entity47 : @entity36 hosts @entity48 in the game of the year the @entity1 method certainly has paid off			1
his overall college coaching record is 137 - 53 - 1 , a .717 winning percentage			1
he has won as many national titles ( two ) as all - time major college wins leader @entity83			2
but @entity1 is the only coach to win a @entity58 championship with two different programs			1
it is a testament to both @entity1 's coaching genius and his tumbleweed past that his dna is on both programs involved in saturday 's showdown			1
here 's how he got there : the son of a @entity95 gas station owner , he began coaching as a grad assistant at alma mater @entity97 in 1973			2
over a lengthy career , he has been employed by nine different college programs , and three more @entity101 franchises			0
following four years as head coach at @entity103 , @entity1 was brought to @entity104 in 2000 after @entity48 had gone 7 - 15 the previous two seasons			1
within four years , @entity1 delivered a national title			1
his professional travelogue did n't end there			0
@entity1 left to test himself as an @entity101 head coach with the @entity110 in 2005			1
two seasons there produced a 15 - 17 record , and then @entity1 was seduced by a once proud southern belle who had fallen into disrepute			2
" i 'm not going to be the @entity13 coach , " @entity1 infamously declared on december 21 , 2006			1
on january 4 , 2007 , he was introduced as the @entity36 's next coach			1
he was apologizing for that one three years later in a @entity119 interview			0
" i apologize for any professional mishandling that might have occurred , " he said			0
but there is a reason @entity36 ponied up $ 4 million a year for @entity1 ( university president @entity123 makes a reported base of $ 490,000 a year )			1
he is one rainmaker of a coach			0
while perhaps not always so dedicated to the truth about his comings and goings , @entity1 is all in with building winning football programs			2
and in 2007 @entity13 needed him badly			2
with 13 national championships in the bank , and the legend of @entity138 growing dim , the @entity36 football program of the early 2000s was a mess			1
one coach was tangled up in a sexual harassment charge and eventually got the program placed on @entity144 probation			0
one hire never coached a game , fired after an off - season @entity148 strip - club romp became public			2
one abandoned ship after two seasons , informing his team he was leaving for @entity153 via video conference			0
another had the name ( @entity157 , son of @entity160 @entity101 coach @entity159 ) but won few hearts with his 26 - 23 record			0
then came @entity1 , whose stern dictatorship cut through all the nonsense			2
he is 51 - 11 at ' @entity165 , with one national title and the hopes of another resting on saturday			2
his success did not sit well a couple states to the left			0
when @entity1 first left for the pros , @entity48 fans were mostly understanding			1
they even cheered him when he returned to @entity104 with the @entity110 in 2005 to take on the @entity174 , who had been displaced from @entity176 after @entity177			0
but when he took over a conference rival , he was a direct threat to their team and the game changed			0
on @entity1 's trip to @entity104 in 2008 , he was greeted with the requisite effigy burning			2
the @entity48 student newspaper produced an editorial that proclaimed : " for the record , @entity1 , the @entity191 faithful hate your guts			1
" " what people suddenly did n't seem to understand is that he did n't leave @entity48 for @entity36 , " said @entity192 , who covers the @entity193 for @entity194			1
after ditching the @entity110 , " the only open jobs were @entity36 , @entity198 and @entity199			2
what was he supposed to do ? " @entity201 has somewhat softened the @entity1 - is - @entity203 storyline when @entity48 and @entity13 play now			1
his connection to @entity48 was brought up only once in his press conference last monday			2
in response , @entity1 sounded almost wistful			0
" i really do n't think a lot about that , but there are a lot of personal relationships we have with a lot of people because of the association we had with @entity48 , " he said			0
" the older you get -- and everybody knows i 'm getting old -- you kind of cherish those relationships and really respect and appreciate them			0
i 'm happy to say a lot of those things do n't get affected by this game and what happens in this game			0
" are the halcyon days of @entity1 - hating gone ? after his clumsy departure from the @entity110 , @entity1 appeared as no. 9 on a @entity33 top 10 list of most disliked people in sports			2
he has not made the last two editions of that list			0
when he completes this season , his fifth , it will match his longest stay at any of his coaching posts			0
" i think there 's a feeling that this is the right place for him and his wife at this stage of their lives , " @entity26 said			0
the @entity1 family was out front in the recovery effort after a devastating tornado swept through @entity40 in april , only reinforcing his @entity36 identity			1
@entity1 's @entity248 provided the $ 50,000 seed money to start @entity250 , which coordinates aid for those who lost homes and loved ones to the storm			2
@entity1 , his wife @entity257 and his team have been out front throughout the recovery process , said @entity260 , @entity250 's managing director			2
" as you know , @entity1 is not one to be exuberant , but he shows he really cares through his actions , " @entity260 said			0
" when he cracks a little smile ( doing the relief work ) , it 's like you or me jumping for joy			0
" maybe some will even begin taking him at his word that , " when i came here , i came here with the idea i 'd be here for the rest of my career			0
" @entity1 may never be the warm and fuzzy good ol ' boy kind of southern football coach			1
because that is just the kind of clutter that has nothing to do with a final score , he 's unlikely to spend much time courting favor			0
at least he has settled into one place long enough now that those who wish to appreciate him know where to find him .			0

no. 1 @entity48 faces no. 2 @entity36 saturday in college football game of the year
@entity13 coach @entity1 has coached both teams to national championsips
@entity1 has angered some with his ugly departures from previous coaching jobs
@entity1 is only coach to take two different *schools* to college football 's @entity58 championship
