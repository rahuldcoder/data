-- more than three years ago , the outgoing @entity2 ambassador in @entity3 , @entity1 , wrote a valedictory note about the government of president @entity6			1
it was titled simply " @entity8 is @entity9			0
" his advice to the @entity12 : " stay the course and prepare for change " in the southern @entity16 nation			1
today , president @entity6 is still in place , though he now heads an uneasy power - sharing government with the opposition @entity20 ( @entity20 )			1
the cable , dated july 2007 , is one of thousands obtained by @entity23 , some of which were published sunday in the @entity25 and four @entity27 newspapers that had advance access to the documents			1
@entity30 goes on to characterize @entity6 , who has been in power since 1980 , as " a brilliant tactician " who is " more clever and more ruthless than any other politician in @entity3			1
" he also believes @entity6 is " hampered by several factors : his ego and belief in his own infallibility			0
" he notes that contacts within the ruling party , the @entity41 , are desperately seeking reform but acknowledge that it wo n't happen while the " @entity45 " is still there			0
@entity6 has been in power in @entity3 since its independence in 1980			2
once one of @entity51 's wealthier nations , with a thriving agricultural sector , it has deteriorated into economic and social turmoil			0
in 2007 , the same year the cable was written , @entity3 had the highest inflation rate in the world at 66,212 percent , according to the @entity56			1
fuel and food shortages prompted @entity30 to say " for the first time the president is under intensifying pressure simultaneously on the economic , political and international fronts " and that @entity6 was " running out of options			1
" he says it up to the @entity2 " once again , to take the lead , to say and do the hard things			0
" he admits in 2007 that @entity6 will " not wake up one morning a changed man , resolved to set right all he has wrought			2
he will not go quietly nor without a fight			0
he will cling to power at all costs			0
" @entity30 added : " @entity6 and his henchman are like bullies everywhere : if they can intimidate , you they will			2
but they 're not used to someone standing up to them and fighting back			0
" according to the cable , @entity30 said the " optimal outcome ... is a genuinely free and fair election , under international supervision			2
" @entity81 , former president of @entity51 , had been trying to mediate in @entity3 and had , according to @entity30 , " the best , albeit very slim , hope of getting there			1
" when considering possible @entity6 successors , @entity30 is less than impressed with the options			1
he calls the @entity20 " far from ideal " and is " convinced that had we [ the @entity2 ] had different partners , we could have achieved more already			0
" he goes on to lament that the current leadership would " require massive hand - holding and assistance should they ever come to power			0
" @entity93 , prime minister and @entity20 head , is characterized by @entity30 as a " brave , committed man " with " star quality			2
" however , @entity30 criticizes @entity97 as being " not readily open to advice , indecisive and with questionable judgment in selecting those around him			0
" perhaps most tellingly @entity30 says of the @entity20 leader : " @entity3 needs him , but should not rely on his executive abilities to lead the country 's recovery			2
" last week , @entity93 took president @entity6 to court , claiming he was making unilateral decisions regarding important @entity110 and judicial appointments in violation of the power sharing arrangement .			1
