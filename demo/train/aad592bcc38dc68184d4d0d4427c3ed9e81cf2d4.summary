-- " what 's wrong with your foot ? " asked the medicine man as i ducked into his grass hut to escape the tropical downpour			1
he could see that i walked with a slight limp			2
like many an aging athlete , i had injured myself while training for a hike			2
i knew i had to condition myself to be able to walk 50 miles carrying a backpack at 9,000 feet			2
so strenuous was the training that i hurt my foot and had to hobble into the offices of physicians , orthopedists and chiropractors -- in short , anyone who might heal my affliction			2
i tried massage , ice packs , heating pads and whirlpool baths			2
i took aspirin , ibuprofen , anti-inflammatories , prescription pain pills and a cortisone injection in search of relief			2
the pain was reduced to the point where it became bearable , and i completed the hike			2
but i felt my injury every step of the way			2
in the ongoing debate over the enormous health care costs in @entity41 , we can do well to look southward at the tropical @entity41 countries where shamans reside and practice their healing			1
like physicians , shamans are not infallible and vary in abilities			1
this shaman -- @entity49 in southern @entity50 -- i knew to be a master of his craft			2
he looked up from a fire he was stoking , over which he was boiling local herbs in a battered old aluminum pot. the smell of the plant potion filled the dwelling as i entered			0
@entity62 wasted no time on pleasantries , even though he had not seen me for almost a year			0
" take off your shoe , " he ordered , and i complied			0
he examined my foot carefully , and then issued another order : " give me your machete ! " i removed the machete from my belt and passed it to him			0
with one clean stroke , he sliced a fuzzy fern off the bark of a nearby palm tree , carried it back to the hut and threw it directly into the flames			0
after less than a minute , the shaman snatched the fern from the fire and applied it to the base of my foot , causing me to howl with pain			0
when both my foot and the fern had cooled , however , the pain had disappeared			0
he then threw the fern in another pot of water , warmed it over the fire , and had me drink the entire potion			0
the pain in my foot went away			0
and for seven months , there was no pain			0
then i returned to the jungle for another successful treatment			0
to some , the term " shaman " may conjure up images of tricksters more than healers			0
but authentic shamans are masters of a sacred craft , living repositories of centuries of therapeutic wisdom			1
the depth of shamans ' knowledge on preventive medicine and diagnostics has astonished even physicians who have studied their approach			1
dr. @entity111 , a @entity112 - trained physician and ethnobotanist specializing in the @entity114 , recently noted , " when asked about disease conditions , shamans present highly detailed and specific descriptions of disease characteristics and associated symptomatology			1
they frequently comment on disease associations and responsiveness to therapy , often demonstrating a remarkable insight into the natural history of disease processes as we understand them			0
" many scientists who study tribal people 's use of plants can recount experiences of injuries or ailments that physicians failed to cure that were then treated successfully by an " uneducated " herbalist , or shaman			1
in other words , we have a lot to learn from shamans			1
but our pharmaceutical industry is often dismissive of nature as a source of healing			1
it seems to overlook the fact that many of the most important classes of prescription drugs like @entity153 inhibitors for high blood pressure ( first developed from @entity156 snake venom ) , beta blockers ( from hallucinogenic @entity159 fungi ) , and cholesterol - lowering statins ( from @entity162 fungus ) came from natural sources			0
and new finds continue to be made			0
@entity111 and his colleagues in @entity166 have recorded indigenous people employing hallucinogenic frog slime to heighten sensory acuity			0
it may contain properties to treat high blood pressure			0
and i have observed medicine men in the northeastern @entity114 using insects to treat arthritis and bacterial infections , indicating that local wisdom regarding the healing potential of plants and animals has been underestimated			1
when i entered the field of rainforest conservation more than three decades ago , there were two basic areas of focus : protecting rainforest ecosystems and protecting traditional rainforest cultures			1
many in the first group overlooked the opportunity to enlist tribal inhabitants of the rainforest , its natural guardians , as allies			1
many in the second passed over the hard truth that these cultures can not survive unless the forests are preserved intact			1
in the spirit of the interconnectedness of all things , we launched the @entity203 to protect the forests , preserve the tribal populations and their cultures and knowledge , and along the way , hopefully discover new medicines from nature			1
the @entity203 has joined forces with our tribal colleagues and local governments to achieve these goals			1
we have partnered with elderly medicine men and women to establish shamans ' apprentice programs and clinics to improve local health care and transmit traditional healing knowledge to succeeding tribal generations			1
we hope you 'll join us to broaden the world 's knowledge			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

@entity227 : in the debate over huge health care costs , we should look south
@entity227 : the shamans of the @entity114 possess centuries of therapeutic wisdom
he says we have a lot to learn from the shamans about healing power of plants
@entity227 : we need to protect the @entity114 forests and preserve the tribal cultures
