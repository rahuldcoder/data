-- in the digital age , consumers expect more and more from their cars , and all brands are pushing the technological envelope			1
@entity7 car company , @entity6 , is hoping to deliver on the driver 's expectations , adding an option that 's far beyond anything that 's under the hood			1
@entity13 , cio of @entity14 , is one of the brains behind the roam delivery service , which aims to make e-shopping and deliveries more convenient			1
@entity0 : how does roam work ? @entity20 : how it would work is that a customer , via an online store , places a purchase then chooses the car as the delivery point			1
then the transportation company gets the opportunity to deliver the goods directly to the vehicle and via a digital key , the transportation company is granted access to the customer 's vehicle			1
when the delivery has been made , the customer gets a confirmation back that the delivery has been done			0
@entity0 : how will you allay customer safety fears in giving complete strangers access to their vehicle ? @entity44 : when it comes to safety and security , this is very important to us within @entity6 cars			1
that goes for physical safety as well as virtual safety , so in this we 're working heavily with digital keys and digital certificates in order to ensure security for our customers			1
the customer grants that the delivery can be made and then gets the confirmation back once the delivery has been made , and that specific digital key ceases to exist			0
@entity0 : what challenges have there been in orchestrating this venture ? @entity44 : one of the biggest challenges has been that @entity6 is only one part of the delivery chain with online shoppers			1
there 's transportation companies , our customers and our vehicles , and bringing those aspects together has been one of the most challenging part			2
@entity0 : what are the benefits of using roam ? if you take the example of consumers , online shopping is one of the areas where consumers can save time , money , and also add convenience to their lives			2
one of the challenges with online shopping is actually the delivery			0
when the delivery is supposed to be made , for example to homes , or in suburban areas , that becomes a hassle ; because the owner of the house is working , out of town and the delivery is sometimes bouncing			0
so the delivery company usually tries to make the delivery not only once , maybe twice , even three times			0
the roam delivery service actually adds convenience and simplicity both for the customers and as well as for the distribution companies			2
the challenge now [ is ] to perfect the concept and get delivery companies to buy into the innovation			0
@entity0 : what effects will the service have on the automotive industry ? what we see today is that the car becomes connected , the customer becomes connected , that actually means that the car is part of the digital ecosystem and is integrated in the network society			2
and that has the opportunity to add additional services , connected services , to us as a society and also to us owners of the vehicle			0
and this is an area where we can see a rapid change within the automotive industry			0
