-- @entity2 's hopes of winning a treble this season ended on saturday with a 1 - 0 defeat to arch - rivals @entity6 in the semifinals of the @entity8 at @entity9			1
@entity11 's team are on course for a record - breaking 19th @entity13 league title and have also reached the semifinals of the @entity15 , but @entity17 's second - half winner gave @entity6 the chance of winning a first trophy in 35 years			1
the @entity21 midfielder pounced after consecutive errors by veteran goalkeeper @entity23 and midfielder @entity24 allowed him the chance to drill in a low shot seven minutes after halftime			0
@entity2 's bid to reach the final of the 140 - year - old knockout competition for a record 19th time was then sabotaged by a moment of madness from 36 - year - old midfielder @entity34			1
the former @entity39 international , the only player of the two squads actually born in @entity37 , was sent off with 18 minutes left for a reckless high lunge into the thigh of @entity6 's @entity43 defender @entity42			0
@entity11 casts doubt over @entity46 future @entity6 last won the tournament in 1969 , and most recently reached the final in 1981 -- one of the modern classics which was won in a replay by @entity52			2
@entity54 's team will face either @entity55 or @entity56 in the final on may 14 , with the two @entity59 teams meeting in sunday 's second semifinal also at @entity39 's national stadium			1
the @entity62 urged his team not to get carried away , with the club still battling to qualify for next season 's @entity15			0
" we have everything in our hands			0
if we have the same spirit we had today , we have the fourth spot , " he said , having molded @entity6 into contenders since taking charge december 2009 after being handed a lavish transfer kitty by billionaire owner @entity73			0
" @entity6 was a small team until three , four , five years ago			0
it 's important to start to win the first trophies			0
" @entity2 should have taken an early lead after dominating the first half - hour , with @entity80 guilty of two bad misses in quick succession			0
the @entity83 , starting in place of suspended @entity39 striker @entity85 , was first denied by quick - thinking goalkeeper @entity86 and then belied the form that has seen him become the @entity59 's top scorer this season by inexplicably scooping the ball over the bar from close range after being found by @entity94 's inviting low cross			0
city , missing injured captain and top scorer @entity95 , capitalized on some slack @entity2 defending after the interval as the 40 - year - old @entity23 -- who retires at the end of this season -- made a poor clearance and then @entity24 gave the ball away to @entity17			2
@entity86 did well to tip a 65th - minute freekick from @entity94 onto the crossbar before @entity34 ' red card forced a reshuffle with @entity80 replaced by midfielder @entity108			2
@entity109 was denied by @entity23 in the final minute and @entity6 survived five minutes of time added on to reach the club 's second final since winning the @entity113 in 1976			1
the match ended in ugly scenes as @entity2 defender @entity116 had to be restrained after @entity108 reacted to @entity6 striker @entity118 's unwise celebrations in front of opposition fans			2
@entity121 in troubled waters at @entity123 in saturday 's @entity59 action , third - placed defending champions @entity125 moved five points clear of @entity6 with a 3 - 1 victory at mid-table @entity128			1
the @entity131 club bounced back from the midweek @entity15 exit at the hands of @entity2 as striker @entity134 leveled the scoring after this time being given the chance to start instead of $ 80 million signing @entity137			0
@entity128 had led through @entity139 striker @entity138 , but @entity140 put @entity125 ahead in the 26th minute and @entity141 sealed victory just before halftime			2
the result eased any fears that @entity125 will not qualify for next season 's top @entity147 competition , moving @entity121 's team eight points clear of fifth - placed @entity52 -- who host @entity2 's main title rivals @entity152 on wednesday			1
@entity152 can reduce @entity2 's lead to four points by beating sixth - placed @entity155 on sunday in a match that @entity158 's team also need to win in order to beat @entity52 to the sole @entity161 spot			1
@entity162 consolidated seventh place with a 2 - 0 victory at home to @entity166 thanks to second - half goals by midfielder @entity168 and defender @entity169 , the latter a penalty			0
@entity172 moved up to ninth with a last - gasp 2 - 1 victory at second - bottom @entity175 as substitute striker @entity176 headed an injury - time winner after teammate @entity178 canceled out @entity180 's early opener			1
@entity183 , @entity147 hopefuls earlier this season , slumped to an eighth defeat in nine games as the 2 - 0 loss at @entity187 left both clubs in a group of four teams on 38 points -- five clear of the relegation zone			2
@entity193 moved out of the bottom three with a 3 - 1 win at @entity195 that dropped the promoted home team into the danger area for the first time this season .			1

@entity6 through to @entity8 final for the first time since 1981
@entity17 's 52nd - minute winner ends @entity2 's hopes of winning three trophies this season
