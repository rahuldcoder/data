this crisis was not created by us , " he said			0
that dialogue might not include @entity1 's new interim government , whom @entity45 criticized			0
" the current government is dependent on the radical nationalists who seized the power , " he said			0
" even our @entity211 partners know what they are like			0

map : how @entity1 is divided @entity4 , a self - governing region in southern @entity1 with an ethnic @entity12 majority and strong cultural ties to @entity12 , has become the epicenter of a battle for influence between @entity159 , @entity160 and the @entity268 since @entity172 was pushed out of office			1
complete coverage on the @entity1 crisis @entity12 fears @entity273 , executive director of the @entity274 and a professor of history at @entity277 , told @entity2 that @entity12 had nothing to gain from the current tensions in @entity1			1
" there is no advantage for @entity12 to stoke this instability , " he said			0
" a lot of it is instability that is born of the great cultural , ethnic and now political divisions that are on the ground			0
" while most @entity1 do not want to be allied solely with either @entity12 or @entity288 , he said , @entity159 is definitely concerned by @entity160 's turn toward the @entity268			1
" the great @entity12 fear right now is that @entity1 , in the guise of being incorporated economically into @entity288 , is slowly incorporated into the @entity293 alliance , " he said			1
" ultimately , of course , @entity12 are concerned about their @entity295 in @entity183			1
this explains their very harsh and highly risky reaction , and the presence of what seem to be @entity12 forces in the @entity4			1
" @entity12 speakers make up about 60 % of @entity4 's population of more than 2 million , but around a quarter are @entity1 and 12 % are @entity303 , a predominantly @entity305 minority			1

" usually it 's a celebration that symbolizes the beginning of spring			0
but right now it 's hard to get into any kind for festive mood , " @entity322 said			0
