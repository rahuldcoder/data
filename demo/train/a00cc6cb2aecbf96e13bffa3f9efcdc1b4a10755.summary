-- @entity1 may be more populous , but @entity2 is better - liked			1
that 's the message from a new set of data released tuesday by the @entity6			2
@entity2 , the 1 - year - old social network that pundits declared dead last year , ties @entity8 at the top of the list of social media sites , with a score of 78 out of 100			1
@entity1 is the least - liked social network on the list , with a score of 61 on the group 's ranking of e-businesses			1
that 's down nearly 8 % from @entity1 's previous ranking , indicating a drop in popularity of the social network that is by far the world 's most populous , with more than 900 million active users			1
by contrast , @entity2 has about 150 million monthly active users			2
" if @entity1 does n't feel the pressure to improve customer satisfaction now , that may soon change , " @entity29 's ceo , @entity28 , said in a news release			2
@entity29 is an analytics firm that partnered with @entity6 to create the report			2
this was the first year @entity2 was included in the ranking , which is based on interviews with consumers			2
@entity6 , which releases monthly reports in a variety of business categories , says it interviews 70,000 people a year			0
with a rating of 63 , @entity44 , another popular network , barely scored higher than @entity1 in terms of customer satisfaction in tuesday 's report			1
@entity50 , which is owned by @entity51 , received a 73 ; pinterest a 73 ; and @entity52 a 64			0
( @entity55 , in case you 're wondering , is n't part of the list anymore )			0
some people who use @entity2 were n't surprised by the ranking			0
" makes sense , " one user wrote in response to a @entity0 question about the news			0
" i 'm sure a lot of people use @entity1 because they genuinely love it , but a huge number are also using it because they feel forced to -- because everyone else they know is using it , or they think they need to have a business presence there			0
so there are many people using @entity1 on a regular basis who do n't actually like it and have plenty to complain about			0
whereas the majority of people using @entity2 regularly only bother to do so because they really prefer it over other sites like @entity1			1
" @entity6 says @entity2 is strong in areas where @entity1 is weak			1
" according to the report , @entity2 's strong showing is a result of an absence of traditional advertising and what is seen as a superior mobile product , " the group says in its news release			0
" @entity2 's strengths may be @entity1 's weaknesses , as users complain about ads and privacy concerns			1
however , the most frequent complaints about @entity1 are changes to its user interface , most recently the introduction of the timeline feature			0
" the index was founded at the @entity107 and gets support from @entity29 for its e-commerce and e-business rankings			0
