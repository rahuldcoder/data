-- last week i offered some eco-friendly cell phone tips for people looking to save energy when they communicate			1
so , today i 'll add it 's also worth noting that several manufacturers already offer solar cell phone chargers			1
solar cell phone chargers are n't just greener			1
they 're also a handy piece of emergency equipment , especially if you get stranded ( at least , during the daytime ) with no access to a working electrical outlet			0
or if you 're spending time outdoors ( at your kid 's baseball game or doing yard work ) , you can keep your phone available and ready without running down the battery			2
examples include : @entity23 , which claims to be compatible ( via adapter cables ) with most feature phone and smartphone brands , as well as popular mobile gaming devices and media players			0
the company also offers a larger model for charging laptops			0
@entity32 , a compact model featuring an attractive petal - like design and a long list of compatible mobile devices			0
) solar @entity40 glove , offered by @entity41			0
the @entity44 mobile phone solar charger			2
also , solar chargers are available for many cell phone accessories , such as speaker phones ( for car use ) or bluetooth headsets			1
the blog 12 - volt solar panels recently explained how solar phone chargers work and reviewed a few models			1
they note that small two - watt solar chargers need about three hours of direct sunlight to fully charge a typical cell phone battery ; 18 - watt models can do the job in about 30 minutes			1
or : why not charge your phone by bike ? this year @entity65 debuted a bike charger kit that works with @entity65 phones			1
@entity68 reports , " the first bike - powered chargers will be made available in @entity71 for around â‚¬ 15 [ $ 20 @entity72 ] and then go on sale later this year worldwide			2
" if you like building your own gadgets ( or if you own a bike but not a @entity65 phone ) , make explains how to build your own bike - powered cell phone charger			1
even though it 's not renewable power , @entity81 's @entity80 is worth a look			0
this device automatically shuts down when it 's done charging your phone -- thus avoiding wasting energy via vampire power			0
whenever you buy a charger for your phone -- especially if you use a smartphone , which often have highly sensitive electronics -- check the manufacturer 's charging specifications for your phone carefully to make sure that a third - party charger is n't likely to damage your phone			2
also check whether using a different charger might void your warranty			0
and of course , take a little time to research online product reviews , forum posts or other information from people with the same kind of phone as yours			0
what was their experience with the charger ? remember that any nonstandard product combination is likely to yield some bad experiences			1
but a pattern of bad reviews ( or no comments , which could indicate something does n't work ) is a red flag .			0
