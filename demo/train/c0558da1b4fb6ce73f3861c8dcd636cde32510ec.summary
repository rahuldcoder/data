instead , charges against the two arose from " related investigations , " authorities said			2
three men had previously been charged in the @entity10 plot , with authorities saying they planned to target president @entity17 's campaign headquarters , the home of @entity0 mayor @entity19 and several other law enforcement and financial sites			1
on sunday , the @entity22 said it had " approved charges against two additional individuals in connection with the ongoing @entity10 investigation			1
" @entity17 , @entity28 meet at @entity29 @entity31 , 24 , of @entity0 , is charged with falsely making a terrorist threat , prosecutors said in a statement			1
@entity34 , 28 , also believed to be from @entity0 , is charged with attempted possession of explosives or incendiary devices			2

the two defendants ( @entity31 and @entity49 ) ... each face their own charges arising from separate incidents			1
" the two appeared in court sunday			0

court documents allege @entity31 , a native of @entity60 , told associates he had made two homemade explosive devices that could " blow up half of an overpass for a train " and was planning to use them during the summit			2
he said last week that they were stored in a @entity0 home in a hollowed - out " @entity70 " book , the documents said			0
he also claimed to possess a vehicle " filled with explosives and weapons , " according to the documents			0
however , a search warrant found no explosives , and @entity31 told investigators that while he had made the statements , he did not actually possess a bomb , the court documents said			0
meanwhile , @entity34 allegedly told an associate that he wanted to obtain materials to make a pipe bomb , and that if the associate got the items , he would create it , according to court documents			0

the three were charged with material support for terrorism , conspiracy to commit terrorism , and possession of explosives or incendiary devices , authorities said			1

a lawyer representing the three has called the accusations against them " propaganda " and said authorities " infiltrated " a peaceful group and set the men up			1
a police probe that began early this month revealed the three suspects are " self - proclaimed anarchists " and members of the " @entity126 " group who traveled together from @entity92 to @entity0 to commit violence as a protest against the @entity10 summit , authorities said in a statement			1
" @entity126 " was the group blamed for violence that occurred in recent " occupy " protests , such as in @entity131 last year when anarchists in ski masks torched cars and clashed with police and even other occupy protesters			0
@entity137 : police van drives through crowd @entity31 also claimed to be a member of the " @entity126 , " court documents said , as well as " an anarchist who is upset with the lack of chaos in @entity0			0
" the three men were planning to destroy police cars and attack four @entity0 police district stations with destructive devices as a way to undermine police response to other planned actions at the @entity10 summit , according to a statement by @entity5 state 's attorney @entity153 and @entity155 superintendent @entity154			1
@entity0 financial institutions were also among the proposed targets , authorities said			1
" the individuals that we have charged in this investigation are not peaceful protesters			2
they are domestic terrorists who came to @entity0 with an anarchist agenda to harm our police officers , intimidate our citizens and to attack their politically motivated targets , " said @entity164			2
@entity137 : protesters march through the streets of @entity0 according to authorities , @entity172 said he wanted to recruit four groups of four co-conspirators -- or 16 people -- and that reconnaissance had already been done on the @entity155 headquarters			2
the three men also possessed or built improvised explosive or incendiary devices , a mortar gun , swords , a hunting bow , throwing stars , and knives with brass - knuckle handles , authorities said			2
in court , prosecutors accused the three men of preparing for " violence and destruction , " such as stockpiling @entity192 cocktails			2
a couple dozen of their supporters in the courtroom could be heard faintly scoffing at prosecutor @entity196 , as he called the defendants " self - proclaimed anarchists ... making preparations for violence and destruction			0
" @entity196 said one of the defendants could be heard planning an attack and quoted him as saying , " this city does not know what it is in for , and it will never be the same			0
" according to @entity196 , the defendants bought gasoline at a @entity210 station , cut bandanas for fuses and had four empty beer bottles to be used as @entity192 cocktails			0
@entity196 told the court that @entity172 made a remark while assembling the @entity192 cocktails : " ever seen a cop on fire ? " defense attorney @entity218 accused authorities of " police misconduct , " saying undercover agents infiltrated a " peaceful " group			2
" they even bought the makings of @entity192 cocktails and gave it to them , " @entity218 said in court			0
outside of court , he called the case a setup and an example of " entrapment to the highest degree			0
" " it is sensationalism by the police and the state to discredit the protesters that have come here to nonviolently protest , " the attorney said			0
the @entity240 , representing the three defendants , said @entity0 police arrested a total of nine activists wednesday at a house in @entity0 's @entity247 neighborhood and then released six of them			0
the guild described the three defendants as " occupy activists " and said police provided no evidence of criminal intent or wrongdoing			0
" it 's outrageous for the city to apply terrorism charges when it 's the police who have been terrorizing activists and threatening their right to protest , " attorney @entity255 with the lawyers guild and the @entity257 , said in a statement			0
judge @entity266 set the three defendants ' next court date for tuesday			0
