-- three years ago , a few days before @entity4 's 21st birthday , a stranger sharing his last name sent him a message on @entity6			1
his mother denied knowing the person at first , but eventually admitted the stranger was his birth mother 's sister			1
the woman he 'd called mom all his life was another aunt			2
the revelation tore the lid off 21 years of family drama that she 'd hidden from him			2
@entity4 's birth mother had down syndrome and could n't care for him ; his aunt and uncle had adopted him			1
when his adoptive father died , a feud tore the family apart , leading @entity4 's mother to decide it was better to sever ties with the family and never share with the young boy his history			1
" without @entity6 , she would n't be part of my life because they did n't want her to have anything to do with me , " the 24 - year - old software engineer from @entity34 said			2
it 's hard to keep secrets in the age of social media and the adoption world is no exception			1
@entity4 's story is just one that shows how the @entity48 is making it easier for birth relatives to find each other , hastening the end of the era of " closed " adoption , the nonprofit @entity45 said in a report released thursday			1
birth parents are seeking out their kids and adopted children are going online to find biological relatives , often without their adoptive parents ' knowledge , according to the report , " untangling the @entity62 : the @entity48 's @entity63			1
" @entity64 , executive director of the @entity45 , said he hopes the report will help shape policies and practices that harness the new technology while protecting vulnerable children and parents			1
" we hope this report will serve as a wake - up call that something historic is happening that demands the attention of legislators , practitioners , law - enforcement officials and the affected parties themselves , " @entity64 said			1
the report also addresses the " growing commodification " of adoption through scams and unregulated websites that raise ethical and legal concerns			1
it 's now nearly impossible -- and perhaps unethical -- to promise secrecy or anonymity in adoptions , the report suggests			1
the report calls for more education and training to help adoption professionals understand the positive and negative uses of the @entity48 , along with revised training programs that assume most people will be able to find each other at some point			1
" everything from @entity96 is being rewritten without best practices or guidance , " @entity64 said			2
" we have a maze in front of us and we have to learn to navigate it and provide people with resources , or they 're going to get lost in it			2
" over the past few decades , it has become more common for birth parents and adopted parents to agree to some sort of open relationship , the report says			1
a recent survey found that 100 infant adoption programs in the @entity115 reported 5 % of their adoptions were completely closed , while 55 % were fully open and 40 % were mediated through an agency , the study said			1
even in open adoptions , it can be hard for people to resist crossing boundaries			1
why wait for a picture in the mail when you can peek at someone on @entity6 , @entity126 or @entity127 ? but if both sides communicate , they can reach an agreement on how to handle each other 's lives online and offline			1
@entity134 's daughter used to send her letters and pictures through her adoptive parents			1
but when the 13 - year - old started sending @entity134 e-mails , she knew she had to tell the girl 's parents			1
" i was aware of her need for connection and i wanted that so much for myself , too , " said @entity134 , who lives in @entity142 , @entity143			2
" but then i had to realize i 'm not the parent making the decisions and i need to stay in my own place in the picture , and also , we will both get what we want in the future as life plays out			2
" sort of like delayed gratification			0
" the girl 's adoptive parents were n't comfortable with e-mail at the time , but @entity134 was grateful to hear they wanted her to have more frequent contact with their daughter as she got older			1
last year , for the first time since her birth , @entity134 's daughter met her birth mother			1
the girl is now 16 , and e-mails with @entity134 with her adoptive parents ' permission			2
a few years ago , her daughter friended her on @entity6 ; @entity134 has n't accepted it , but she keeps it in the queue so she can see how the profile picture changes			0
" the internet does provide more opportunities for surveillance of each other but not really in a negative way , " she said			0
" it 's hard to walk that line between wanting to respect boundaries and still wanting a connection			2
" the internet opens up possibilities but it does n't change any of the inherent complicated feelings that everyone has around the situation			0
" indeed , not everyone agrees open adoption always works			0
in a recent guest post on the blog " @entity193 , " a woman who adopted a child from foster care detailed her decision to close the adoption for the child 's safety			2
the boy 's biological parents had a history of drug and alcohol abuse and erratic behavior			1
in the few instances she initiated contact , the mother angrily demanded to see her child , signaling to the adoptive mother that she was unstable			0
" i tried to open up our adoption , maybe just a little bit			0
and it was a huge mistake			0
the state created closed adoptions from foster care for a reason , " the adoptive mother wrote in her post , " why my son has a @entity223			1
" " i will never badmouth his birth parents to him			1
he has seen their photos and i answer whatever basic questions he has			0
but he has n't had many			0
when he is 18 , he can read my huge , thick file of his records from the state , including his birth parents ' full names etc. " but while he is underage , i will protect him and keep him safe			1
even from his own relatives			2
" the @entity48 has created vast support networks for birth parents , adoptive parents and adoptees , including blogs , social media sites and message boards			1
among the millions of links , though , it 's easy for those seeking guidance to be overwhelmed			2
it took @entity246 six years to find @entity247 , a support group for expectant mothers or mothers who found new families for their children			1
they were the first ones she turned to after she learned that her 17 - year - old son wanted to visit her			0
two months earlier , in september 2010 , the son she had named @entity257 sent her a message on @entity6 : " @entity259			0
" @entity246 had hoped to one day meet the son she gave up for adoption years earlier , but she worried he would hate her			0
friends from the support group told her to be brave			0
she went to the airport two hours ahead of time and cried while she waited			0
she was unsure if she would recognize him but as soon as he rounded the corner she knew it was him			0
the two embraced , marking the start of a relationship that continues to thrive , she said , even with his adoptive family			0
" it 's like he was never out of my life even though he went down a different path , " the @entity275 woman said			2
" i feel good about it , too , knowing he had a good life and became the fine young man he is today			0
" not every encounter has a storybook ending			0
@entity286 is happy he knows who his biological mother is , but it has n't brought peace or closure to the rest of his family			0
it took him two years to respond to the @entity6 message and call his mother			0
they spoke briefly about her decision , and he concluded that @entity302 had prevented her from making her own decision			0
the two became @entity6 friends , keeping in touch through occasional messages , he said			0
but in the interest of avoiding conflict , he has n't taken the relationship any further			0
there 's still a lot of tension between his adoptive family and the one he never knew , and he 's not interested in starting another feud			2
" i ca n't blame her for wanting to see her son grow up , " he said			0
" this is a way for her to stay quietly in the background and be a part of my life			0
" " like " @entity326 on @entity6 and follow @entity327 on @entity126			0

@entity48 makes it easier for birth relatives to find each other , @entity45 report says
it 's now nearly impossible to promise secrecy or anonymity in adoptions , the report says
report hopes to shape policies that harness technology while protecting children , parents
some say closed adoptions still necessary sometimes to protect children
