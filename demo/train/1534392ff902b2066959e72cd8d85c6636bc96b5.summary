three days after a massive earthquake threw @entity2 into chaos , @entity0 was homeless , along with her two children			1
but her nightmare was just beginning			2
" i was gang - raped while i was sleeping in the middle of the street , " she said			2
" and i got pregnant			2
" @entity0 did not know her attackers			2
depressed and unsure of what to do next , she was directed by a friend to a clinic run by @entity12 , a @entity14 acronym that translates into the @entity15			2
" by the time i got to them , my belly was already big , " she said			2
" but they took care of me			2
" @entity0 was given food , water , housing and prenatal care			2
she decided to keep her daughter , even though the psychological pain could be difficult -- and still is , two years later			2
" it 's terrible , " said @entity0 , 33			2
" i love my daughter ... ( but ) i look at myself and see that i have a child that is a product of a gang rape			1
" her story is , unfortunately , all too common in @entity2 , said @entity33 , one of @entity12 's co-founders			1
" after ( the earthquake ) , the situation was inhumane and degrading , " @entity33 said			1
" there was no security in the ( displacement ) camps			2
there was no food ; there was no work			0
and now there is a rampant problem			0
" accurate numbers are difficult , if not impossible , to find in the aftermath of such devastation , but @entity12 and other groups say they have seen a definite increase in rape cases after the january 2010 earthquake			1
" victims became more vulnerable due to a range of things , " said @entity54 , director of the @entity55			1
" they lost their houses ; there were no locked doors anymore			0
people lost family members who were a source of protection			0
" terrible living conditions , including a shortage of food and water , contribute to the problem as well , said @entity71 , a senior communications officer with the @entity73 high commissioner for refugees ' @entity75 office			0
" the conditions are so dehumanizing , " @entity76 said			0
" over months and months , it increases all forms of violence , including sexual violence			0
" there has also been a lack of prosecution in the country			0
in the first two years after the quake , not one person in @entity2 has been convicted of rape , according to the @entity89			1
" the big problem is , you ca n't find justice , " said @entity33 , 52			1
even before the quake , she says , rape was an issue in @entity2 , historically underreported because of social stigma , retaliation from perpetrators and a lack of legal support			1
that is what led her and @entity104 to start @entity12 in 2004			0
since the group 's inception , it has helped more than 4,000 rape survivors find safety , psychological support and / or legal aid			1
" we tell people to come out of silence , " she said			0
" do not be afraid to say that you have been victimized			0
" @entity33 knows what it 's like to be a victim of sexual violence			1
she has been raped twice , and her husband died as a result of beatings he endured trying to save her from being raped			0
in 2010 , her 14 - year - old daughter was raped in a displacement camp			1
" i ca n't describe to you how i felt when i heard about that , because i was a victim , " she said			0
" i started asking myself what kind of generation i came from			0
am i cursed ? " do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity134 she escorted her daughter to two police stations and received no assistance , she said , just a lot of talk			1
one police officer told her that " girls are so promiscuous " and indicated that many young girls are asking for sex			0
but she carries on , " fighting with hope that i know there will be a change , " she said			0
internationally , she has testified before the @entity148 , calling for increased security within the displacement camps and asking that women 's groups be included in decision - making processes			1
" i was a victim , and i did not find justice			0
but know i will get it for other women , " she told @entity134			1
when the earthquake hit @entity2 , @entity12 's founders watched their clinic and their offices collapse along with their homes			1
@entity33 lived in the dangerous @entity162 displacement camp for half a year			1
there , she said , she watched as conditions deteriorated			0
" it was all kinds of people who ended up in one area , " she said			0
" the jails were not destroyed , but their doors were opened , and all prisoners went free			0
many of them ... were armed , and they were notorious murderers			0
" one criminal held @entity33 at gunpoint , demanding money			1
the police never showed up , she said , but she managed to escape after a group of supporters arrived to fight			1
@entity33 said many single women had to leave their children with strangers in order to search for food , water or work			1
in some cases , the children were raped			0
the youngest victim , she says , was a 17 - month - old			0
" i spent six months witnessing it , " she said			0
" babies are not spared ; adults are not spared ; mothers are not spared ; sisters are not spared			0
" despite the escalating violence and the loss of its clinic , @entity12 regrouped to help victims in @entity2 's " tent city " camps , where about 500,000 people still live today			1
the group has 66 female outreach agents and 25 male security guards who work within the camps , organizing nighttime community watch groups and providing whistles and flashlights to women			1
all of them have been affected by gender - based violence , whether personally or through a family member or loved one , @entity33 said			1
@entity12 also relies on more than 1,000 members to help share their stories , support the victims and urge them to come forward and fight for justice			1
it usually starts by accompanying the victims to the hospital within 72 hours of being raped			2
once they undergo a test , they receive the medical certificate they must have to begin legal proceedings			0
" after that , we assign a lawyer to her , " @entity33 said			1
there is no cost to the victims , and they receive support from @entity12 through the trial			2
@entity33 says she is determined to keep fighting for a brighter future , even though justice has been elusive			1
" my dream is that we will get to a place where we stop talking about the number of rape cases , " she said			2
" we will stop talking about @entity2 as a country where people are committing violence against others			1
one day , we have to be able to say that we have a country with people who respect each other			0
