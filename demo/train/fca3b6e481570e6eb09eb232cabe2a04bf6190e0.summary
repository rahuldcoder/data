-- @entity1 may need passports to board domestic flights or to picnic in a national park next year if they live in one of the states defying the federal @entity8			1
homeland security secretary @entity9 says there are no plans for a federal database of drivers ' information			1
the act , signed in 2005 as part of an emergency military spending and tsunami relief bill , aims to weave driver 's licenses and state id cards into a sort of national identification system by may 2008			0
the law sets baseline criteria for how driver 's licenses will be issued and what information they must contain			0
the @entity29 insists @entity8 is an essential weapon in the war on terror , but privacy and civil liberties watchdogs are calling the initiative an overly intrusive measure that smacks of @entity37			1
more than half the nation 's state legislatures have passed or proposed legislation denouncing the plan , and some have penned bills expressly forbidding compliance			1
several states have begun making arrangements for the new requirements -- four have passed legislation applauding the measure -- but even they may have trouble meeting the act 's deadline			2
the cards would be mandatory for all " federal purposes , " which include boarding an airplane or walking into a federal building , nuclear facility or national park , homeland security secretary @entity9 told the @entity57 last week			1
citizens in states that do n't comply with the new rules will have to use passports for federal purposes			2
" for terrorists , travel documents are like weapons , " @entity9 said			1
" we do have a right and an obligation to see that those licenses reflect the identity of the person who 's presenting it			0
" @entity9 said the @entity8 program is essential to national security because there are presently 8,000 types of identification accepted to enter the @entity1			1
" it is simply unreasonable to expect our border inspectors to be able to detect forgeries on documents that range from baptismal certificates from small towns in @entity84 to cards that purport to reflect citizenship privileges in a province somewhere in @entity88 , " he said			2
@entity9 attended the conference in @entity90 , @entity91 , in part to allay states ' concerns , but he had few concrete answers on funding			1
the @entity29 , which estimates state and federal costs could reach $ 23.1 billion over 10 years , is looking for ways to lessen the burden on states , he said			1
on the recent congressional front , however , @entity9 could point only to an amendment killed in the @entity104 last month that would 've provided $ 300 million for the program			1
" there 's going to be an irreducible expense that falls on you , and that 's part of the shared responsibility , " @entity9 told the state legislators			1
@entity112 , senior legal fellow for the @entity113 , a @entity114 - based conservative think tank that supports the @entity8 , said states should n't be pushing for more federal dollars because , ultimately , that will mean more federal oversight -- and many complaints about cost coincide with complaints about the federal government overstepping its bounds			1
" they are only being asked to do what they should 've already done to protect their citizens , " @entity123 said , blaming arcane software and policies at state motor vehicle departments for what he called " a tremendous trafficking in state driver 's licenses			0
" the @entity57 is calling @entity8 an " unfunded mandate " that could cost states up to $ 14 billion over the next decade , but for which only $ 40 million has been federally approved			1
the group is demanding @entity138 pony up $ 1 billion for startup costs by year 's end or scrap the proposal altogether			1
everyone must visit @entity143 by 2013 the @entity8 repealed a provision in the @entity145 calling for state and federal officials to examine security standards for driver 's licenses			2
it called instead for states to begin issuing new federal licenses , lasting no longer than eight years , by may 11 , 2008 , unless they are granted an extension			2
it also requires all 245 million license and state id holders to visit their local departments of motor vehicles and apply for a @entity8 by 2013			1
applicants must bring a photo id , birth certificate , proof of @entity164 number and proof of residence , and states must maintain and protect massive databases housing the information			2
@entity57 spokesman @entity170 said the requirements are " almost physically impossible			0
" states will have to build new facilities , secure those facilities and shell out for additional equipment and personnel			2
those costs are going to fall back on the @entity1 taxpayer , he said			0
it might be in the form of a new transportation , motor vehicle or gasoline tax			0
or you might find it tacked on to your next state tax bill			0
in @entity84 , @entity170 said , one official told him that without federal funding , the @entity84 might have to charge its citizens more than $ 100 for a license			0
" we kind of feel like the way they went about this is backwards , " @entity170 said , explaining that states would have appreciated more input into the process			0
" each state has its own unique challenges and these are best addressed at state levels			0
a one - size - fits - all approach to driver 's licenses does n't necessarily work			0
" many states have revolted			0
the governors of @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity114 have signed bills refusing to comply with the act			1
six others have passed bills and / or resolutions expressing opposition , and 15 have similar legislation pending			0
though the @entity57 says most states ' opposition stems from the lack of funding , some states cited other reasons for resisting the initiative			0
@entity210 passed a @entity228 bill opposing the program and calling @entity8 " contrary and repugnant " to the state and federal constitutions			1
a @entity233 @entity228 resolution dismissed @entity8 by expressing support for the war on terror but " not at the expense of essential civil rights and liberties of citizens of this country			2
" privacy concerns raised @entity233 and @entity210 lawmakers are not alone			1
groups like the @entity245 and @entity246 say the ids and supporting databases -- which @entity9 said would eventually be federally interconnected -- will infringe on privacy			1
@entity246 says on its web site that the information in the databases will lay the groundwork for " a wide range of surveillance activities " by government and businesses that " will be able to easily read your private information " because of the bar code required on each card			0
the databases will provide a one - stop shop for identity thieves , adds the @entity245 on its web site , and the @entity1 " surveillance society " and private sector will have access to the system " for the routine tracking , monitoring and regulation of individuals ' movements and activities			0
" the civil liberties watchdog dubs the @entity247 " internal passports " and claims it would n't be long before office buildings , gas stations , toll booths , subways and buses begin accessing the system			0
but @entity9 told legislators last week that @entity29 has no intention of creating a federal database , and @entity123 , of the @entity113 , said the @entity245 's allegations are disingenuous			2
states will be permitted to share data only when validating someone 's identity , @entity123 said			0
" the federal government would n't have any greater access to driver 's license information than it does today , " @entity123 said			0
states have the right to refuse to comply with the program , he said , and they also have the right to continue issuing ids and driver 's licenses that do n't meet @entity8 requirements			1
but , @entity123 said , " any state that 's refusing to implement this key recommendation by the @entity145 , and whose state driver 's licenses are as a result used in another terrorist attack , should be held responsible			0
" state reaction to @entity8 has not been all negative			2
four states have passed bills or resolutions expressing approval for the program , and 13 states have similar legislation pending ( several states have pending pieces of legislation both applauding and opposing @entity8 )			1
@entity9 said there would be repercussions for states choosing not to comply			1
" this is not a mandate , " @entity9 said			2
" a state does n't have to do this , but if the state does n't have -- at the end of the day , at the end of the deadline -- real id - compliant licenses then the state can not expect that those licenses will be accepted for federal purposes			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
