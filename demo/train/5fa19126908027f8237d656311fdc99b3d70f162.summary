-- on july 20 , many of us woke to the horrific images of the events that had unfolded in an @entity6 , @entity7 , movie theater where 12 people were killed and 58 wounded			1
in the wake of the tragedy , we do n't simply wonder who or why , but also how ? soon after , president @entity12 gave a fiery speech , stating , " @entity14 belong in the hands of soldiers , not in the hands of criminals			1
they belong on the battlefield of war , not on the streets of our cities			0
" while you might think such a statement indicated that the president was going to show some real leadership and fulfill his promises to reinstate the assault weapons ban , which expired in 2004 , the @entity24 later released a statement saying that gun control was not something the administration was going to push at this time			1
the president seems more concerned with making sure the @entity35 people know of his commitment to protect their @entity38 rights than he does with protecting them from the danger posed by assault rifles in the hands of criminals			2
opinion : when will @entity35 wake up to gun violence ? no politician , including the most powerful man in the free world , wants to pull the trigger on solving the complex issue of gun control			1
the odds of political survival after such a move are worse than those in a game of @entity57 roulette			0
when he was governor of @entity59 , @entity58 strongly backed gun control , dubbing assault rifles " instruments of destruction , " and he signed the first comprehensive state ban on assault weapons like the @entity65 , which @entity66 is accused of using in @entity6			1
however , now @entity58 does not " believe in new laws restricting gun ownership and gun use			1
" do n't get me wrong , the @entity38 is one of my favorites			0
in the military , i was an expert marksman who trained foreign militaries in counter-guerilla warfare , and i am an avid gun enthusiast			0
as a gun owner , i absolutely believe in the right to protect my family from anyone who threatens our safety			0
but i also know that when the @entity38 was passed in 1791 , the most lethal weapon was a single - shot musket			0
arguing that you need an assault rifle to protect your family is like saying you need a blowtorch to light a cigarette			0
within months of 9/11 , new security measures were put in place at airports to ensure the safety of airline travel			0
in the wake of the @entity99 bombing , new laws were enacted to detect suspected criminals and new security measures were put in place at federal buildings			0
however , since 1982 we 've had 56 incidents of mass killings involving firearms , many of which were semi-automatic handguns and assault rifles			1
yet here we stand , 30 years later , no closer to resolution on even the simplest forms of stricter gun control			1
such resolution is blocked at almost every step of the way by the juggernaut that is the @entity118			2
there are no two cozier bedfellows than the @entity118 and politicians ; if laws controlled guns the way the @entity118 controls politicians , @entity35 would be the safest country in the world			1
@entity127 : @entity128 drives opposition to gun control the @entity118 makes more than $ 200 million a year			1
these earnings , coupled with its 4 - million strong membership , has paralyzed any thoughtful discussion of the issue from politicians who are scared to even have an honest debate of where the proper lines should be drawn			2
one only has to look at @entity35 sen. @entity140 , @entity141 , the two - time chairman of the @entity142 , who after a 36 - year career lost his primary race in the face of heavy campaigning against him by conservative groups , including the @entity118 , which criticized his support for a ban on assault rifles			1
it 's political suicide to even propose safety measures like background checks at gun shows			0
president @entity12 and @entity58 are focused laser - like on the key swing states , which all have significant gun ownership			1
it 's clear that both candidates are afraid of turning off these gun owners and the @entity118			1
with 4 million members on its rolls and as many as 47 % of all @entity35 reporting gun ownership , appearing sympathetic to the ideals of the @entity118 is a significant consideration for anyone running for public office			1
the @entity118 wields a carrot - and - stick approach to politics , doling out generous political backing to those who agree with it or to those who are simply running against someone who disagrees with it			2
the group also employs a rating system under which candidates are graded according to their votes on key issues			0
the @entity118 is always transparent about certain votes being graded , and as such candidates are always on notice before they vote			2
until we face the power of the @entity118 and truly measure the length of its reach , the issue of gun control is doomed to stay exactly where it is -- stuck			1
challenging such a powerful lobby , daunting as it appears , is paramount , because we ca n't allow special interests to run roughshod over the public interest			0
the issue of guns and how we as a country regulate their ownership and use must be addressed -- and soon			0
i am like many gun owners who , polls have shown , stand by both our right to bear arms and the responsibility to create safety measures that protect the public			0
yes , we want to have our cake and eat it , too , and i firmly believe such a middle ground -- not a " flip - flop " a @entity213 , nor an empty promise , a la @entity12 -- exists			2
but we need to jump - start the conversation -- and stay well clear of the fiery rhetoric			0
as it stands , a little more than a week after @entity66 gunned down 12 people , including 6 - year - old @entity219 , who were enjoying a night out at the movies , we are left with some politicians ' righteous indignation and a few photo ops			2
a dozen grieving families and a nation deserve more -- we deserve real leadership			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			2

@entity231 : neither major party candidate seems willing to take on gun control issue
despite dozens of mass killings , politicians remain in thrall to the @entity118 , he says
@entity229 : after 12 died and 58 were wounded in @entity6 , we must act on gun issue
he says @entity12 has n't kept promise on assault weapons ban ; @entity58 *changed* his views
