-- imagine the top three things that might make you happier and more productive at the office			1
i bet larger lunch tables did n't make your list			2
but that and a few other small but concrete steps like overlapping lunch breaks and moving coffee stations can improve workplace morale and productivity by as much as 25 % , according to @entity14 , a research scientist and ceo of @entity16 , a management consulting firm			1
" if you go to a company and tell them you will increase their productivity by 25 % , they will expect that they have to completely reorganize , " @entity14 told me last week at the @entity17			1
but a total reorganization is n't necessary , according to @entity14 's research , which first began in 2006 when he was a doctoral student at @entity28 's @entity27			1
scientists at the @entity28 consider ways in which technology might enhance the human experience			0
( though @entity14 co-founded his company last year , he continues his research at @entity28 and @entity36			1
) @entity14 and his team use a method they call " reality mining " to come up with insights about work productivity and satisfaction			1
reality mining may appear to be more science fiction than fact , but from our cell phones to e-mail to work @entity50 badges , we leave behind constant trails of information about ourselves			2
stand up and live longer analyzing raw data derived from specially designed social sensing id badges that collect quantitative data on human behavior , @entity14 began drawing out patterns to help predict outcomes in a variety of situations			1
his early experiments involved observing speed dating sessions and pitches to venture capitalists			0
" we found in our studies that we had incredible predictive power , " says @entity14			1
" in the speed dating experiment , with five minutes of data we could predict with 85 % accuracy whether people were going to go out on a date			0
" @entity14 went on to combine the data from the social sensing id badges with other data sources -- e-mail and instant messaging patterns , phone logs , and meeting informationâ € ” and selected data features that related to job performance and satisfaction , and how people communicate and collaborate			1
he then began to test those features across dozens of companies in different industries			0
" eventually we found the same trends recurring over and over again , making it highly unlikely that our findings were a coincidence			2
" @entity14 's research revealed that the key to transformation in the workplace is " social levers " -- small changes that people respond to in dramatic ways			1
act on these social levers in the right way and you will get big results			2
author : do n't check your emotions at the workplace door what are some important social levers ? having a tight - knit group that you can commiserate with is a critical one , says @entity14			1
it is evident across companies and cultures : a tight group enables employees to vent and gain support			0
it also allows for the exchange of complex information and tips			0
the size of your network matters as well			0
in one project , @entity14 and his team observed workers in a lunchroom with tables of varying sizes -- some with four seats and others with 10 to 12 seats			1
the lunch groups remained fairly stable over time			0
" we found that the people who sat at the larger tables had substantially higher performance , " observes @entity14			1
this is because they had created a much bigger network to tap into			0
over the course of the week , they saw the same people again and again			0
consequently , they often knew what these colleagues were working on and could go to them if they had a problem			0
the employees at the smaller tables , on the other hand , had smaller networks and less opportunity to interact			0
the diversity within your network also matters , the team discovered			2
@entity14 finds that people tend to spend time with those who are similar to them			1
" whether it 's gender , race or the school you went to , there are many different ways we break ourselves into groups			2
" for a healthier work life , get off your duff ! but it 's important to break out of your comfort zone , expand your network and connect with broader groups			1
what makes people more innovative and productive is having different connections in a variety of social groups , according to their research			1
if all your friends are similar and have the same opinions , preferences and habits , there are n't many new ideas coming in			0
@entity187 out and talk to people in groups you would n't normally talk to , suggests @entity14			1
it does n't have to be through a formal mechanism			0
" it can be through bumping into people by the coffee machine			0
just standing there and chatting gives you new perspective			2
our research shows that chance encounters make people more effective			0
" @entity14 recommends taking time every day to walk around , check in with people and say hello			1
workers who are more physically active are more excited , emotive and engaged in their work			2
this drives up energy levels and makes people more productive and happy , he says			0
the physical environment is also a huge social lever			0
@entity14 finds that companies often do n't think strategically about the people they want interacting with each other			2
" if you are stuck in an office far away from everyone you work with , it 's unlikely that you will be talking to anyone else			1
" your location can affect morale and productivity , as can a workplace where everyone sits in their offices with the doors closed			2
you need to have the right groups bumping into and talking to each other			0
one final social lever : reduce e-mail ! " the more e-mail you engage in , the less effective you are , " says @entity14			1
" people think being on the computer is the same as being face to face			0
" e-mail and instant messaging are not universally bad , he says , but if we rely on them too much and do n't take the time to interact with people on a personal level , we will pay the price			0
there is a pervasive belief in our society that in order to be productive , we need to be chained to our desks with our heads down			0
but @entity14 's research begs to differ			1
as it turns out , the secret to effectiveness and happiness at work might just be communication , friendship and social interaction			1
