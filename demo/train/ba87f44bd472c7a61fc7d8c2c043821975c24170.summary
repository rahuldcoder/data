wednesday was a day for digging out in @entity1			1
but forecasters are warning more snow might be on the way			1
to be sure , it will be nothing compared to what has already fallen this week			2
@entity7 , @entity8 , received a record 34.5 inches from monday through wednesday			1
" there 's so much of it , you have a problem because there 's just nothing to do with it , " a resident told @entity0 affiliate @entity10			2
he compared it with a blizzard in 1978 and a storm in 2013			2
" this is much worse , " he said			2
" it just never stopped			2
" for many people in @entity1 this blizzard brought whiteout conditions from heavy snow and wind greater than 35 mph for as long as 14 hours			1
in towns and cities from @entity28 to @entity8 to @entity29 there were plenty of folks who were digging through more than 30 inches of fresh snow on sidewalks and driveways			1
homeowners were n't just dealing with the question of where to put all the snow			1
some had to call their insurance agents , like residents of 11 homes in @entity42 , @entity8 , where there was significant damage after a seawall breach			1
after deserting the streets tuesday as the storm struck , traffic moved again along major roads in @entity8 and beyond			1
@entity51 's @entity50 accepted incoming flights around 8 a.m. , according to spokesman @entity53			0
buses and trains in @entity8 -- including the @entity51 - area subway system , the " t " -- ran again , with major roads reopened as well , said incoming state transportation secretary @entity59			1
but schools in @entity51 were closed , as they will be thursday			0
the @entity62 said wednesday that another system is moving toward the area and several more inches of snow could come down thursday night into friday night			1
the high on saturday is forecast to be 16 degrees			0
@entity0 senior meteorologist @entity68 said as the low pressure develops off the coast , damaging winds might yet again be in store for @entity1 on friday and saturday			1
if anyone has a right to complain , it was those digging out wednesday not just in @entity1 but also on @entity78 's @entity77			1
the weather service reported that @entity80 on the tip of @entity77 , ended up with 30 inches of snow			1
that 's about 10 inches more than fell across @entity84 in @entity85 , @entity28 , though mayor @entity86 noted that his city has up to 8 - foot drifts and some roads that were still impassable wednesday morning			1
" we 're getting there , " said @entity86			0
" but it will be another day or two digging out from this			0
this is n't going anywhere			0
" " there are still a few dead ends that we still need to punch through to get to , to make sure that people can get out of their houses , " the mayor said			0
one good thing : because it was colder than expected , most of the snow did n't weigh enough to snap too many limbs down onto too many power lines			1
so instead of 300,000 power outages in @entity8 , as authorities had feared , the number topped out at 36,000 , according to @entity112 spokesman @entity111			1
" although we may end up with record snow , it 's not going to be a record disaster , which it could have very well been , " @entity111 said			1
still , any outage can be deadly in a winter storm like this			0
and at one point an entire island , @entity122 , was in the dark			0
four hours after the power went out , @entity124 gave birth to her first child at @entity128 -- with a few lights on and some heat , thanks to the facility 's generator			1
" and @entity124 is a superstar , " said dr. @entity134 , who noted that a " blizzard girl " joined @entity124 's " blizzard boy , " @entity138 , a short time later at the same hospital			2
" she did it all naturally			0
" in central @entity28 , @entity140 felt her contractions coming on overnight monday			0
after getting the ok from @entity144 police to break the travel ban , she drove in and settled into the hospital in time for the birth of her baby , @entity148			2
@entity150 and baby had plenty of quality time together tuesday , since visitors could n't hit the roads to come see them			2
" it 's so boring , " @entity157 said			0
" i ca n't wait to go home			0
" for @entity161 , there 's no going home			0
the @entity163 war veteran had evacuated to a friend 's house overnight , knowing that things might not be safe in her own home of @entity42 , a town of 25,000 located 30 miles south of @entity51			2
when she got back home , the @entity168 sergeant broke down in tears			0
" part of the roof collapsed , the wall , my door was missing , " @entity170 said of her house			0
" it was just destroyed			0
" she was n't alone , as 10 other homes in the same seaside town were also damaged after the powerful storm tore down about 50 feet of seawall			0
two of the houses were damaged badly enough to be condemned			0
there was significant flooding there and in other coastal communities around @entity8 , which had to deal not only with storm surges but lashing winds that in some places topped 75 mph			1
even so , there is also recognition that -- for the vast majority of the 58 million people in the storm 's path , especially given the dire warnings -- it could have been even worse			2
" despite the fact that we had record - breaking snowfall in many parts of @entity8 , " gov. @entity199 said wednesday , " we have come out of this , i think , in relatively good shape			1
" @entity0 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0

@entity7 , @entity8 sets record with total for one snowstorm
towns in @entity1 and on @entity77 under 30 inches of snow
more snow -- much less this time -- *appears* to be in the near *future*
