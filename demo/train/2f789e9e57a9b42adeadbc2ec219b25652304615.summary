-- as darkness falls on @entity3 , the floodlights flick on and locals gather for a game of kick - about late into the night			2
the bars , restaurants , sidewalks and beaches of @entity11 all seem to pulse to the beat of football			1
it 's a @entity16 love affair that dates back to 1894 when @entity17 -- a @entity16 of @entity19 - @entity18 decent -- returned from studying in @entity19 to help establish the @entity20 , bringing with him some equipment , a rule - book and two balls			1
one was round and one was oval shaped			2
football was quickly adopted and thrived , but rugby remained in the shadows of its closest competitor , a sport largely played by expatriates from rugby - playing nations			1
but times are changin ' in @entity16			1
new opportunities are bringing new life to an old game and over the past five years 10,000 @entity16 players have taken up the sport			1
rugby sevens ' inclusion in the 2016 @entity42 , with a guarantee of automatic qualification for the home nation , has encouraged new clubs to spring up in diverse and remote regions across the country with players seeking to represent their country			1
part of this rugby revolution are four @entity11 brothers -- @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 -- who live in the @entity58 , one of the city 's largest slums , perched on the hillside above @entity63			1
all four siblings play to a high standard , but @entity55 has already represented @entity66 and shows huge promise			2
they reside in a toppling multistory space which is held together with brick , plastic and corrugated iron in the heart of @entity58			2
" because the family kept on growing we converted it , " @entity55 told @entity0			2
" on the ground floor is my mother , my dad			2
the second my sister and her children ... above that my sister with her daughter			0
above is me , my brother , cousin and his baby			0
he 's on one side , i 'm on the other with that little window			0
" on the top floor , stuck to the left panel of the little window is a sticker saying " @entity93 " -- the only visible evidence that one of @entity16 's brightest rugby talents lives here			1
like many sports that make inroads in @entity16 , the brothers ' first encounter with rugby came on the beach			1
" a friend of mine used play on the beach , " explains @entity55			0
" out of curiosity i asked him what rugby was and he said , ' c'mon i 'll show you			1
' " at first i did n't want to because it seemed like a violent sport			0
the following week i went to watch and they asked me to join them , so i did			0
i 've stayed ever since			0
" the brothers are being helped to achieve their potential by @entity116 , one of several initiatives designed to grow the game in @entity16			1
" @entity116 welcomed us like a family and we accepted it like a family			1
it showed us things , like how to respect others , " adds @entity55			0
just as importantly , rugby has helped provide a respite from the toughness of favela life			1
" a lot of people who grow up here in this community do n't have the mentality to do anything , " says @entity55			0
" they think they 're ' made - men , ' but no ... the education that my parents gave me -- to follow what is right and leave what is wrong behind -- is just like rugby			1
" they 've helped us to not only stay in the favelas but take us out of the community and travel			0
" efforts by the @entity11 authorities to squeeze out criminal gangs and drug lords in order to make the area safer for its residents have led to an escalation of tension with the police , who have been criticized for their heavy handed and some times violent approach			0
against that backdrop the boys continue their training , using a small clearing outside their home when space on the beaches and practice areas is in short supply			0
" this was something crazy that i came up with , " says @entity55 , pointing to a set of handmade weights -- four metal bars and plastic tubs filled with cement			0
" i 've been playing rugby for some time now , and i made this out of concrete because i wanted to grow stronger			1
it struck me as something that i needed to do			0
" down on the vast expanse of @entity63 beach , laughing and joking the brothers deftly toss the rugby ball to and fro			2
when their feet touch the sand they launch into action , leaping , spin - passing and sprinting , demonstrating well - rehearsed drills			0
@entity57 means " passion " in @entity193 , and these brothers are full of it			0
beside them a group of locals are playing football , but the boys do n't give them a second glance			2
even in @entity202 year , @entity16 does n't begin and end with football , and rugby is beginning to march to the beat of its own drum .			1

@entity116 arrived in @entity16 at the same time as football
while football thrived immediately , rugby has taken *longer*
but inclusion of rugby sevens in 2016 @entity216 has encouraged its growth
