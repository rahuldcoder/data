@entity0 -- it came as no surprise to anyone who is a baseball fan that last year on september 28 a flurry of articles marked the 50th anniversary of @entity9 ' final game			1
@entity9 ended his career as few major leaguers do , with a home run in his final at bat			1
but this year as we approach the 51st anniversary of the game that ended @entity9 ' career in 1960 , it is time to turn our attention to novelist @entity21			1
it is the story @entity21 wrote for the @entity23 , " @entity29 , " that has allowed @entity9 ' last hurrah to take on a life of its own and that last year prompted critic @entity26 to argue that " @entity27 " is " probably the most celebrated baseball essay ever			1
" thanks to @entity21 , @entity9 ' last home run is far better known than his even more remarkable feat -- which took place exactly 70 years ago this month --- of going six for eight on the final day of the 1941 season to lift his average to .406 and become the last man in baseball to hit .400			1
like @entity21 , i was at @entity9 ' final game			1
i cut the graduate school poetry class i normally went to three afternoons a week for the chance to see @entity9 end his career			0
i had expected to get stuck sitting in the center field bleachers , but @entity44 was not even half filled			0
only 10,454 fans showed up for the game with the @entity47			0
the @entity48 were a seventh - place ball club in 1960 , and even for @entity9 , most @entity49 were unwilling to take off work on a wednesday afternoon so gloomy that in the sixth inning the stadium lights were turned on			0
i got good seats along the third base line , and in the fifth inning i was able to move down to the field boxes next to the visitors ' dugout			0
the ushers could not have cared less			0
before the game @entity9 was honored with a @entity62 silver bowl and speeches from @entity65 's mayor and @entity48 television announcer @entity66 , but the ceremonies felt perfunctory			1
like the small @entity44 crowd , they reflected @entity65 's divided view of @entity9			2
he was someone to admire but not to love , and in his final game he stayed true to form			1
in his last time at bat in an otherwise meaningless game , @entity9 pulled his miracle			2
in the eighth inning on the third pitch to him , he hit a towering home run to right field that cleared the @entity48 bullpen with plenty to spare			0
it was the 521st home run in a baseball career that had been interrupted by service as a @entity85 pilot during @entity86 and the @entity87			0
the home run was the perfect stage exit , but as @entity9 trotted around the bases with his head down , he made no effort to dwell on the drama of the moment			0
once in the @entity48 dugout , he refused to come out despite the chants of " we want @entity9 , " and when at the start of the ninth inning manager @entity98 sent @entity9 out to his left field position , then instantly replaced him , he jogged back to the @entity48 dugout with his eyes firmly on the ground			0
as he had done since the end of his first year in the major leagues , @entity9 refused to tip his hat to the applauding fans			2
the @entity9 whom @entity21 describes is a man divided between pride in his craft and determination to avoid making himself vulnerable to the whims of fans			1
but what sets @entity9 apart in @entity21 's account is that his internal and external struggles have taken place before thousands in stadiums across the country			2
in his role as a marquee athlete , he has not had privacy since his rookie year of 1939			0
as much as our contemporary culture will allow , @entity9 is a man of mythic dimensions , in @entity21 's story , ironically titled to sound as if it belonged on the sports page , @entity9 is both " @entity130 , the hero of incomparable powers and beauty , " and a figure who at rest looks like " @entity137			1
" but always he is larger than life			0
circling the bases following his home run , @entity9 moves for @entity21 " like a feather caught in a vortex			2
" @entity21 was able to capture more than any of us saw that afternoon at @entity44 , and with the passage of time , his story of @entity9 ' final game has become more powerful than the original experience			1
@entity21 's account is all that thousands who were never at @entity44 that fall afternoon , and who now outnumber those of us there , know of the heights on which @entity9 left the game			1
if @entity9 is our achilles , then @entity21 is our @entity158			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0

@entity161 : this year marks 70th anniversary of @entity9 ' .400 season
@entity166 says @entity21 told *lyrical* story of @entity9 ' final game
