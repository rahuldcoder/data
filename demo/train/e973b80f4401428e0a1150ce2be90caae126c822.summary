-- and @entity0 's @entity1 is ... @entity2 ! she is the gift that keeps on giving			1
first the 49 - year - old @entity6 winner teamed up with the uproarious @entity7 in @entity9 's winning buddy cop comedy @entity10			1
then , as dr. @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity2 gives an emotionally naked performance that will likely earn her an @entity6 nomination			1
@entity2 's tremendous talent and range â € ” to say nothing of the woman 's trademark grace and good humor in good times and bad â € ” is what earned her the top spot on our annual list of the most exciting performers in 2013			1
@entity0 : @entity27 plays ' chopsticks ' with @entity2 @entity2 's one - two punch demanded a fair amount of give and take from the actor			1

" once i realized that that drove the film i had to step back , " she says			0

) " what if she had absolutely nothing to fight for ? " @entity2 says she proposed			2
" she 's lost a child , there 's nothing back home , she 's a person who 's basically a machine			0
that was my idea and @entity75 was so open to it			0
" and as for squashing talk of another gravity , @entity2 appreciated @entity80 's alternate ending idea of @entity81 falling from the sky on top of her at the end			1
" the last scene you just see us on top of each other , limbs everywhere , " she imagines with a laugh			0
" our hands intertwine with our last breath of air and we die on top of each other clutching the @entity64			0
" @entity2 is joined by 15 more @entity96 , including the masterminds behind @entity98 , @entity100 star @entity99 , girl on fire @entity102 , a very @entity104 , and more			1
