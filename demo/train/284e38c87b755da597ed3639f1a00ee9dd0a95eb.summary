-- seventeen years after the release of her breakthrough album , " my life , " @entity1 offers up a sequel -- " @entity5 : ... @entity6 ( @entity7 1 )			1
" " the first ' @entity4 ' album was about healing and helping people get through things , " the singer told @entity0			1
" now there 's recession , there 's war and there 's people really not feeling good about life anymore			1
so it 's time , because people need to feel the hug that comes through music			1
" in the mid- 90s , @entity1 herself was in a troubled place , spiraling downward with drugs , alcohol and a tumultuous relationship with @entity29 of the @entity31 duo @entity29			1
" i just knew by maybe 1997 , i would be dead or just finished			2
that 's where we were at the time			2
we were very suicidal , very dark , " she recalled			2
@entity1 admits she reached out to fans for support , because she did n't know where else to turn			1
" i spoke up through my lyrics that i needed help , and the spirit that came behind it was that i was sad , you know , " she said			2
four million people responded to that album , saying , ' @entity1 , wow			1
' " " @entity5 " finds the @entity50 native in a very different place			1
at 40 , she 's cemented her place as an @entity54 icon , with 50 million in worldwide album sales and nine @entity56			1
in 2003 , she married @entity57 , a man she credits with saving her life			0
and lately , she 's been honing her acting chops , taking on the role of a nightclub owner in the big - screen adaptation of " @entity63 , " starring @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
she 's also set to star as the eclectic jazz great @entity68 in the biopic , " @entity68			2
" it 's " @entity71 " playing " @entity72			2
" @entity0 caught up with @entity1 last week in @entity73 to talk to her about her music , her acting and @entity64			1
@entity0 : a lot has changed in the 17 years between " @entity4 " and " @entity5 " what precipitated that change ? @entity1 : that 's an interesting question			1
i come from embarrassment , and my mom struggling , and having two jobs and leaving us with the baby sitter -- and coming back and we 're outside the baby sitter 's house			2
i 've come back from abuse from people			0
it started snowballing into this thing that was hurting me , and i was in the public eye			0
i got to a place where i understood that i needed help , and that was during the " @entity99 " album ( released in 2001 ) when i met my husband -- who was my boyfriend at the time			2
and who knew that he was going to have the information that he had for me , and that i was going to be able to receive it ? @entity0 : we 've seen young people like @entity108 struggling			0
why is it that she ca n't get it together ? @entity1 : why ca n't @entity108 and so many other people get it together ? i mean , everyone is afraid of the pain			1
that is a painful walk			0
it brings a tear to your eye when you have to walk down the red carpet with so much shame in you , and so you would rather paint something on			0
but in my case , i never cared about being embarrassed or ashamed to ask for help			0
i was just ashamed of being ashamed			0
i was just tired of feeling that way			0
@entity0 : you talk about being abused			0
the @entity131 scandal must have hit you pretty hard , as someone who went through an experience that was similar			0
@entity1 : yeah , it hurts when i see stuff like that -- children being molested by grown - ups			1
but the thing that i have learned is that there is something wrong with that grown - up			1
it is something wrong with that adult that people are overlooking , and sweeping under the rug and throwing money on			0
and you have to get to a place where it 's just , " you know what ? you did it , but i have got to get out of it			2
you did it to me , but i ca n't let you destroy me , and not allow me to have a chance to have what i am supposed to have in life -- which is happiness , which is success , which is life , period			0
" that is the only way i can describe it			0
@entity0 : it sounds like it took you a while to get to that place where you said , " i 'm deserving of all this success			2
" @entity1 : it did take me a while			1
it was just recently that i started saying , " you know what ? i am deserving			1
" i would n't say two years ago , but i 'd say maybe five or six years ago i was like , " wow , i deserve this " -- because sometimes when i get so many accolades , i want to bury my head			1
but then i hear someone say , " no , pick your head up			0
you are walking the walk			0
you are not finished yet , but you are still standing in the fire , walking through the fire			0
you 're still 40 , but you are still standing up for women proudly , and doing what you need to do , so keep your head up			0
" @entity0 : let 's talk about " @entity63			2
" @entity1 : i play a gentleman 's club owner			1
i mean , you know ... @entity0 : is that a strip club , @entity1 ? @entity1 : yeah , it 's a strip club ! but you know , on the highest scale			1
and my job is to encourage those women to feel better in a dark place			0
@entity0 : did you have direct scenes with @entity64 ? @entity1 : i definitely had a scene with @entity64 , and he is just so helpful and so much fun			1
everyone was just -- how can i say it ? everyone in that star - studded cast , they were just as star - struck to meet me as i was to meet them			2
and when i met @entity65 , she was like , " i love you ! " and i was like , " what ? i love you ! " and @entity66 is just amazing			0
and @entity209 is my friend , and @entity210 ( the director ) is one of my really good friends			0
so we were like family -- no joke			0
@entity0 : you seem to be in a really good place , and that 's reflected on " @entity5 " @entity1 : yeah , i am			1
the place i 'm in with " @entity5 " is understanding that there will be trials			1
it is not going to be , " oh , everything is wonderful all of the time , " because it is not			0
and the balance is you either know how to get around it , or you just have to go through it			0

@entity1 's new album , " @entity5 , " is a follow - up to an album from 17 years ago
the singer says that recently , she has learned to say , " you know what ? i am deserving "
" you either know how to get around it , or you just have to go through it , " @entity1 says
