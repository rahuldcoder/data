@entity0 -- this year , as for the past 12 years or more , parishioners from @entity3 have marched under their church banner in @entity0 's colorful gay pride parade			1
but this year , there was a difference			0
their banner was blank , missing the name of the church			2
@entity0 's archbishop @entity12 asked the church 's pastor to keep @entity3 ' name out of the picture			1
the parish was told that the archdiocese 's spiritual leader was concerned the church might be seen as endorsing some elements of the gay pride march that may advocate a promiscuous lifestyle			2
" our people are not endorsing that at all , " said the church 's pastor , the rev. @entity23			1
members of the gay ministries of @entity29 say they view the parade as an opportunity to welcome gay @entity32 back into the fold			1
they hand out welcome brochures to reach out to anyone watching the march			0
" perhaps some people come to @entity3 because they do n't feel judged , " said @entity37 , a self - proclaimed lesbian who has been active in the parish for several years			1
" i do n't know if it 's the @entity41 , but there 's love ... the presence of the savior , " said @entity37			0
for years , @entity46 and other parishioners have taken their spirit to the streets , proud to advertise their church			2
" it 's empowering , it 's refreshing , it 's a mission , and people need to know there 's a place they can come home to , " said @entity37			0
she said when parishioners heard about keeping their church 's name under wraps in the march , many in the church 's gay ministries were n't happy			1
" i was like , hell no , " said @entity37			0
then , she said the @entity66 -- lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender -- ministries together decided to march with a blank banner and continue to distribute their brochures			1
" we are honoring his request , " she said of the archbishop			0
but they also wore t - shirts on which they printed the @entity29 name			1
a compromise , @entity37 said , that they and their pastor accept			0
" for me , the blank banner stands for , ' we 've been silenced			2
' for me , that 's also very powerful and we can -- i can -- live with that this year			0
" a spokesman for @entity12 told @entity1 he had no comment .			0
