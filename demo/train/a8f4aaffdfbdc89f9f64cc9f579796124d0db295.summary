a controversial @entity1 surveillance unit that cataloged information on @entity4 communities has been disbanded , according to the department			1
the @entity1 's @entity6 -- or @entity7 -- was developed with the @entity9 's help after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
the unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included @entity4 - owned business and mosques across the @entity16 region and has been the target of controversy and civil lawsuits			1
" @entity22 , previously referred to as the demographics unit , has been largely inactive since january , " the department said in a statement tuesday			2
" recently , as part of an ongoing assessment of @entity28 operations , personnel assigned to the @entity7 were reassigned to other duties within the @entity28			0
" the statement continued : " understanding certain local demographics can be a useful factor when assessing information regarding potential threats coming to the attention of the @entity1 , it has been determined that much of the same information previously gathered by the @entity7 may be obtained through direct outreach by the @entity1 to the communities concerned			1
" two advocacy groups that filed a lawsuit challenging the unit and its activities said they were pleased it had been disbanded but want to ensure the surveillance stops			1
" while we welcome the dismantling of the @entity6 as a long overdue step towards reining in the unconstitutional excesses of the @entity1 , what has to stop is the practice of suspicion-less surveillance of @entity4 communities , not just the unit assigned to do it , " said a joint statement by @entity46 and the @entity47 , which filed the lawsuit in 2012			1
" we will continue to work , through litigation and advocacy , to ensure the @entity1 is fully and finally respecting the rights of the @entity63			1
" that suit , @entity65 of @entity16 , was dismissed in february and is currently under appeal			2
the @entity16 chapter of the @entity68 echoed those sentiments			0
" this is an important first step			0
however , the damage of unconstitutional mass spying on people solely on the basis of their religion has already been carried out and must be addressed , " said @entity72 president @entity71			2
this decision and the city 's move to drop an appeal of a federal judge 's august ruling that the controversial stop - and - frisk practice violated the @entity86 are seen as signs of changes in the way the city operates			2
mayor @entity91 and police commissioner @entity92 have replaced former mayor @entity93 and former commissioner @entity94			0
" our administration has promised the people of @entity16 a police force that keeps our city safe , but that is also respectful and fair			0
this reform is a critical step forward in easing tensions between the police and the communities they serve , so that our cops and our citizens can help one another go after the real bad guys , " de @entity91 said in a statement tuesday			0
@entity92 , who was police commissioner in the 1990s , once again took the helm of the nation 's largest police department in december at a time of low crime rates but heightened tension with the public over his predecessor 's controversial policies			0
when @entity92 was introduced as @entity16 police commissioner , he talked about bringing the police and the public " together in a collaboration of mutual respect and mutual trust			0
" " i will get it right again in @entity16 , " @entity92 said			0
in february : spying on @entity4 is legal ?			1

@entity1 started the @entity6 after 9/11 and monitored @entity4 business , mosques
the department disbanded the group , saying outreach could yield the same the information
advocacy groups that filed suit welcomed the decision but remain *vigilant* about spying
