-- a @entity2 military spokesman confirmed the existence friday of a report on detecting extremism in service members			1
but he disputed a claim that it was classified only after the shootings at @entity9 , @entity10			1
security expert @entity11 told @entity0 she contributed to a 2008 report aimed at helping the military spot signs of extremism among troops			1
she said the report was unclassified at its inception but is now under wraps			1
@entity11 says the military 's attitude about the report -- she says political correctness trumped the study -- caused it to fail in its intended purpose of helping the military detect signs that one of its own might pose a threat			1
on friday , a spokesman for the @entity2 military 's @entity30 , @entity32 , said that his command has the report , but he denied that it was classified only after the shootings at @entity9			1
" the classification of the document has n't changed since its origination back in august of 2008 , " he said			1
@entity11 said closer attention to the study could have helped prevent the november 5 shootings at @entity9			1
she said it was meant to detect signs of extremism like those reportedly exhibited by maj. @entity46 , an @entity47 psychiatrist who authorities say killed 13 at @entity9			1
@entity46 was wounded in the incident and is paralyzed from the waist down			2
" these people did n't have to die , and that 's why i 'm speaking out , " @entity11 said			0
" it 's an atrocity that this even had to happen			0
... you would think , eight years after 9/11 , we 'd be smarter , " she said			0
@entity11 was involved in the case of @entity59 spc. @entity58 , a @entity60 convert who was convicted in 2004 of trying to pass information to @entity63 over the @entity64			0
afterward , she was asked to contribute to the report , " @entity66 within @entity67 " ( @entity67 )			2
it was completed in april 2008 , she said			0
after the @entity58 case , @entity11 said , the military recognized a need for more awareness to stop radicalization among troops			1
" the intent behind the whole report was to provide a useful tool for intelligence officials to spot and identify certain signs of radical behavior , " she said			2
at the time it was completed , it was her understanding that it was not classified , she said			2
she told @entity0 's " @entity87 360 Â° " that she understood the report was sent to " intelligence officials within the defense community as well as the greater intelligence community			2
" after the @entity9 shootings , she said she contacted the military after hearing no mention of the study in the media or from military officials			1
" i sat quiet for a week , " she told @entity0			0
" ... people were acting like there was nothing out there that could have been useful			0
" @entity11 said she was told the study was now classified			1
" the @entity67 report was intended to prevent something like this , and it 's just astonishing that this even had to happen after something like that has been prepared as a useful tool			2
" @entity105 accuse the military a key congressional committee opened an investigation into the shootings thursday , pledging to find out if authorities failed to " connect the dots " and could have prevented the attack			1
members said they planned to focus on whether senior @entity47 officials appropriately dealt with concerns raised by @entity46 's colleagues about his " mental stability and political extremism			0
" among other issues , the @entity119 has said it was aware of communication between @entity46 an @entity123 , a @entity124 - @entity2 cleric who has promoted jihad against the @entity2 and other @entity127 countries			1
but investigators determined that those contacts were " consistent with research being conducted by @entity131			0
" also , a memo reportedly written two years ago by @entity46 's supervisor at @entity134 says @entity46 demonstrated " a pattern of poor judgment and a lack of professionalism " during his residency at the hospital			0
@entity0 could not corroborate the authenticity of the memo , which was obtained by @entity142			0
a former classmate has said he witnessed at least two of @entity46 's @entity146 discussions that included what he described as extremist views			0
in these presentations , which were supposed to be about health , the source said that @entity46 justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of @entity60 in the @entity154 , in the @entity2 and in the @entity2 military			1
" people are saying that , ' wow , this is brand new , ' but in my travels , in talking with counterterrorism experts around the world , especially in @entity165 , this whole process of radicalization has gone through a much more in - depth study , a much more professional rigor than i think what we 've seen in the @entity2 , " rep. @entity156 of @entity157 , the ranking @entity158 on the @entity159 , told @entity0 's @entity87			1
" we could have learned from them , and it looks like we did n't			0
" a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told @entity0 that when @entity46 first came to the attention of investigators because of his communications with @entity123 , officials looked at his military personnel file , and nothing was found that raised suspicion			1
none of the items that have been reported since the shootings -- including the reported @entity134 memo and the powerpoint presentation arguing that @entity60 in the @entity47 should be allowed conscientious objector status -- were part of the file , the official said , but it was noted that @entity46 had done research about @entity60 in the military			1
@entity11 said she was incredulous when defense secretary @entity193 announced a 45 - day review of @entity67 policies to see if the @entity67 had fallen short in identifying service members " who could potentially pose credible threats to others			0
" that review apparently will do " exactly what this report encompassed , " @entity11 said			2
" it 's just like , you know what ? they need to fall on their sword and we need to fix this			0
" " i think what you need to do here is , you need to understand the phenomenon , " @entity156 said			0
" i think the political correctness here is not about profiling			0
it is a reluctance to acknowledge that this problem actually exists , to confront it and ultimately , then , to defeat it			0
i think that we can study this problem			2
" @entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this report .			2
