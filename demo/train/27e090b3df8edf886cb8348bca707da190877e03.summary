-- look out @entity2 , @entity1 has arrived			1
as famous for his larger than life demeanor as he is for his goalscoring exploits , the mercurial striker has completed his move from @entity7 to the @entity9 club			1
he joined on a long - term deal , @entity2 said on its website monday wit the fee reportedly around $ 26.5 million			2
" i 'm very happy , " @entity1 told the club 's official website			2
" we 've been talking about coming here and now i 'm happy to be here			0
" @entity2 are one of the best teams here in @entity19 and the football is very good here			2
" it 's a great team with young players , and that 's why i came here			0
" the @entity23 is well known to @entity19 football fans after a turbulent two - and - a - half - year stint with @entity26 , where he helped the team to a first league title in 44 years while also gaining a cult following for his off - field antics			1
but @entity1 could be just the man @entity2 needs to help spearhead its @entity9 and @entity32 challenge following the departure of last season 's top scorer @entity34 to @entity36			1
" @entity34 's exit left a hole in the side in terms of his goals but more than that , it also left a hole in terms of @entity2 losing a player idolized by the @entity50 , " @entity37 , writer for @entity38 and the @entity40 websites , told @entity0			0
" few players are idolized at @entity38 to the same kind of level that @entity34 enjoyed but @entity54 is in prime position to take that crown			0
" there are question marks about his temperament but @entity2 are signing a 24 - year - old established @entity23 international , a different proposition to the teenager @entity26 courted , the youngster @entity57 said was unmanageable			1
" every signing is a risk but at Â £ 16 million in today 's market that risk is far smaller than the ones taken a few transfer windows ago when @entity2 paid Â £ 35 million for @entity70 and @entity71 paid Â £ 50 million for @entity72			0
" @entity1 will bring joy to @entity38 , whether it 's more from his natural talent as a comedian or a goalscorer remains to be seen , but the chances are it 'll be both			0
