-- @entity1 does n't cost any money to use , but it 's not free			1
@entity4 's popular online e-mail service , which turns 10 tuesday , may not charge for its @entity1 accounts			1
but the company is still collecting payment in the form of massive amounts of personal information about the people who use it			1
with an estimated 500 - plus million users , @entity1 has grown to dominate the web - mail world			2
it has also repeatedly found itself in hot water over privacy			0
@entity1 is facing multiple privacy lawsuits in the @entity18 and @entity19 , some accusing the company of illegal wiretapping for scanning the content of e-mails			1
@entity4 reported $ 16.86 billion in revenues for the last quarter of 2013 alone			0
one way it makes money from @entity1 is by automatically scanning and indexing messages and using the data it mines to show relevant ads to its users			1
" the basic premise of @entity1 is , we 'll give you a robust e-mail service and in exchange we want to display ads alongside our e-mail and we 're scanning your e-mail to decide what ads are most relevant , " said @entity35 , a professor at the @entity36			1
scanning and ads @entity1 looks for keywords that identify topics of discussion based on things such as frequency and context , then matches the e-mail up with related ads. a conversation thread about meeting up at a spinning class , for example , might trigger an ad for a weight - loss product			2
@entity62 gathered through e-mail scanning can also be used to create user profiles for future ad targeting			1
what many consumers do n't consider is that companies such as @entity4 can create a comprehensive profile of each user based on information from different products such as search , maps , e-mail and @entity76 , its social network			1
" nothing in life is free , and as a result it is important for people to understand what value they bring to a free service of any kind , " said @entity77 , a partner at the law firm @entity78 in @entity79			0
when people send and receive messages using a free e-mail service , they are sharing details about their interests , who their connections are and what their finances look like			2
that information might seem mundane on the surface , but when extracted and organized , it 's incredibly valuable to marketers and advertisers			0
all the major e-mail providers , including @entity104 and @entity105 , benefit one way or another from offering a free service			0
the provider might serve up general or targeted ads , generate a user base for marketing other services , or just use the e-mail service to build brand recognition			1
and while @entity1 may have popularized it , targeted ads based on user data has become the primary business model for many tech companies			1
it 's how social media companies such as @entity120 and search engines such as @entity122 make money as well as a huge number of apps that scrape contact and location information from users			0
it 's also led to a number of similar privacy lawsuits against other companies , including @entity132 , @entity105 and @entity120			1
any company that collects personal information has to advise its customers what it is doing with their information and comply with any relevant privacy laws , @entity77 said			1
these are usually laid out in the lengthy terms and conditions and privacy policies that customers barely skim before hitting " agree			0
" however , many of the details about how exactly @entity4 's program works have been kept confidential			2
and critics say the service does n't adequately disclose what it is doing with customers ' information			0
legal action when @entity1 made its debut in 2004 , it was upfront about the fact that it would show contextual ads targeted to match the topic of e-mail threads			2
people still lined up to be accepted as early beta users of the service because it was slickly designed , included ample amounts of storage , and was excellent at filtering out spam			0
and it did n't cost anything to sign up			0
one problem is that not all the people affected have agreed to @entity4 's privacy policy			1
one group of plaintiffs in a recent class - action lawsuit were @entity174 users who sent messages to @entity1 accounts			0
@entity4 responded that @entity178 customers had no expectations of privacy when sending e-mails to people who did use the service			2
@entity4 has defended its e-mail scanning program by pointing out that it 's automated and handled by computers picking out keywords			2
@entity4 's employees are n't personally reading through e-mails for the latest lovers ' spat			1
@entity4 also says the scans are necessary to cut down on malicious e-mails and spam , and for features such as @entity195 and the tabbed view that filters e-mails into different categories			2
a federal judge dealt a blow to the case this month , ruling it could n't proceed as a class - action lawsuit because the different groups were n't cohesive enough			0
a class - action lawsuit could have cost @entity4 trillions of dollars in damages			0
a changing landscape when @entity1 debuted in 2004 , the rules for collecting user information were looser			2
but the privacy landscape has changed drastically over the past 10 years			0
several @entity18 states have passed laws that restrict the use of personal information , the @entity211 has been more active pursuing privacy violations , and the industry has adopted best practices about what 's acceptable			1
one thing that has n't changed is the federal law with the biggest impact on how and when companies can share data with third parties			0
the @entity226 is a dusty piece of legislation passed in 1986 , long before the era of cloud - based e-mail			0
many legislators and technology companies ( including @entity4 ) have lobbied to have the law updated to reflect the times			0
meanwhile , consumers must increasingly weigh the value of using a free e-mail service such as @entity1 against their personal privacy .			1

@entity4 's @entity1 has turned online e-mail service into a *profitable* business
the company scans e-mails and uses data for targeted ads and user profiles
many users do n't realize how much their personal information is worth
@entity1 has been the target of multiple privacy lawsuits
