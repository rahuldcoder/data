the new web series " an @entity1 " is fun , trendy and over the top			0
it 's also breaking taboos , dismantling stereotypes and creating major buzz in the continent			0
set in @entity9 , the series focuses on five glamorous young women who 've returned to @entity11 after living abroad for years			1
they navigate the chaotic world of love , adventure and careers -- all while trying to reconnect with their bustling capital in spiky heels and fabulous clothes			0
fans describe it as the @entity24 version of " @entity25 , " a comparison that show creator @entity27 readily welcomes			1
@entity28 caught up with @entity27 to find out more about the series and what inspired the former expatriate to do it			1
and the story closely mirrors hers			2
born in @entity9 , her family fled to @entity37 in the 1980s to escape a coup			1
they later relocated to the @entity40 , where she grew up before packing up her bags recently and returning home			0
" i always dreamed of @entity9 ; @entity9 was where i wanted to be , " she says			1
" @entity9 had color , it had potential , it had opportunity			1
" @entity28 : how did the show come about ? @entity27 : i wanted something for @entity24 women , something for us and by us			1
i was tired of the sole narrative of the @entity24 woman being about poverty and disease			1
i wanted to see another narrative -- one of beauty , glamor and intelligence			1
i knew i had to do something about it			0
i could n't keep complaining about the problem			0
why did you decide on this particular theme ? after returning to @entity9 from the @entity40 , i was sitting in my living room watching re-runs of " @entity25 , " and that sparked a solution to the problem : " an @entity1			1
" i was first inspired by its model -- a @entity75 , a @entity76 , a @entity77 and , well , two @entity78			2
leading ladies being completely vulnerable and open in the discovery of themselves -- whether sensually or professionally			0
women are raving about the fashion and makeup ... @entity9 designers graciously loaned us clothes to use during production			1
i wanted this show to be a platform for all creatives -- fashion designers , musicians , interior designers , painters , etc. @entity24 culture tends to be conservative , and sex conversations can be a taboo			1
but you went there ... yes , @entity24 culture can be conservative			1
but you get enough @entity24 women in a room , and conservatism can easily give way to what is real , to what is intimate , to what is vulnerable			2
and i think as a continent we are ready to bring down the facade and just be real			0
for the sake of the next generation , there are too many societal issues that need to be addressed in a real and authentic way			0
critics have said a lot of @entity24 women ca n't relate to the show			1
thoughts ? do we all have to be burned - out chemistry teachers with cancer to relate to " @entity120 " ? do we all have to be @entity122 - @entity40 mobsters living in @entity123 to relate to " @entity124 " ? in @entity9 , my choices for film entertainment are limited			2
" an @entity1 " is trying to be the answer to what is lacking in our film industry ; it 's trying to be of high production value while incorporating the stories of @entity9 and others throughout @entity24			1
others have said the lives of the women in the show revolve around men ... their lives do not revolve around men , but the show revolves around the part of their lives that does			2
however , if people really pay attention ... there is a lot to learn			0
episode six touches on the @entity148 while an upcoming episode nine brings up training female cooperatives and fighting the @entity151			0
the show focuses on a narrative rarely seen , even in @entity24			1
was that your goal ? i wanted a tv show about modern , beautiful , educated @entity24 women -- sometimes doing unintelligent things or going through absurd situations -- but for comedic purposes			1
when it comes to the @entity24 woman , there is room for many stories			1
stories that we -- as @entity24 -- can take control of and share with the world			1
what about this show unifies all women , regardless of background ? as women , we 've all been in love			2
we are all looking for love			0
if you 're a female ceo or a woman pounding yams in the village , you are trying to take stake of your love life			0
the love life you assumed you would have ( because of societal / cultural ideals ) versus the love life that realistically exists			0
but , for me , a key unifying factor is nearly every @entity24 woman wants the narrative on the @entity24 woman changed			1
this show is one of the many ways to do so			2
why did you decide to go the @entity194 way , instead of tv ? i loved that i would not lose any creative control to a tv network			0
i wanted to push some boundaries and i did n't want any tv network telling me otherwise			2
which brings me to the next question			0
are you generating revenue from the show ? you know , for me , it 's not about the revenue			2
season one was really about just doing something in regards to the narrative , even if i had to use my own savings to get that done			0
best compliment you 've received so far ? there are women in @entity24 and throughout the @entity215 who have written me to just say thank you , that they are not used to seeing themselves on the screen			2
they are grateful and i am honored			0
when mainstream media ignores you or constantly tells you that there is only one type of you , you feel invisible			0
" an @entity1 " is about our visibility			0
most misleading misunderstanding about the show ? i wanted the show to start a conversation -- many conversations at that			2
the one conversation i would like to address is when people ask : " is this @entity24 ? " but , that 's the thing -- what is @entity24 ? or , what is @entity24 " enough " ? in a world where you have @entity24 immigrants who are born and raised elsewhere , are they no longer @entity24 ? who decides ? talk to the critics ... what do you want them to know ? i am aware of what they do not like about the show			1
but , i do n't see those things as problems and they should n't either			0
this is our show -- the show for us as @entity24 women			1
we can all work together to make it better from episode to episode , from season to season			0
and to the fans : thank you			0
thanks for showing tv networks the kind of content that we are all thirsting for , and what we 're all thirsting for is other narratives of the @entity24 woman .			2

creator @entity27 sets her story in @entity11 , @entity9
she says she wanted to create a narrative " of beauty , glamor and intelligence "
@entity27 says she was inspired as she watched re-runs of " @entity25 "
she wanted the show to tell the stories of not just @entity9 , but @entity24 as well
