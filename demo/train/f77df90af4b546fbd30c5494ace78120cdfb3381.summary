-- some skygazers along the @entity2 of @entity3 witnessed a spectacular solar eclipse sunday morning			1
the eclipse was visible for a few minutes from parts of @entity3 , @entity7 , the @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10			1
@entity11 said the eclipse would be one of the most interesting solar events of the year , because it was a hybrid annular - total eclipse			1
that means for part of its path , it was an annular eclipse -- where a thin ring of sunlight is visible around the moon 's shadow -- and for another part , it was a total eclipse			1
that phenomenon was only visible from a narrow band of the @entity27 and equatorial @entity10 , @entity11 said			1
in a much broader area , viewers saw a partial eclipse			1
but photographers in the eastern @entity32 liked what they saw			1
@entity34 photographed the eclipse from his apartment in @entity37 , @entity38			1
" i 'm on the 15th floor , and i knew i had a great view of the sunrise , so i set my alarm and crossed my fingers that the clouds would cooperate , " he said			2
for him , the eclipse lasted only five minutes before the sun ducked behind the clouds			1
" by that time it was too hard to observe anyway due to the increasing brightness of the sun , " he explained			0
" but i 'm glad the clouds cooperated			0
i 've never seen a solar eclipse and just found out yesterday that i would have a prime opportunity this morning			1
" military photojournalist @entity54 woke up at 6 a.m. to see the much - anticipated eclipse			1
an avid follower of space and science news , @entity54 set his camera up in front of his home in @entity62 , @entity63 , and started taking photographs			0
" i pointed the camera and tried not to look through the lens because it was so intense			0
i was constantly adjusting the camera to make sure i was still pointing at it			0
i just got lucky , " he said about the images he captured			0
despite reports that the eclipse would only last a few minutes , @entity54 says he was surprised to see the event last more than 10 minutes			2
" it was unbelievably vivid			0
i have never seen an eclipse at sunrise before			2
it was actually very haunting			0
it looked like something out of a movie , " he said			0
@entity80 said he only saw the partial eclipse for a few short minutes			1
@entity80 photographed the eclipse during a chance opportunity			2
he read about the event the night before but forgot about it soon after			0
when he woke up sunday morning , he realized the eclipse would be happening in 20 minutes			1
he put his 5 - year - old son and 6 - year - old nephew in his car while they were all still in their pajamas and drove them to the highest point in their town of @entity96 , @entity97 , which is an elementary school called @entity99			0
" there were a few other people hanging out there to see the eclipse			2
it was surprising , but sort of neat , " he said			0
he and his boys watched the eclipse happen over the horizon			2
" my kids thought it was really cool			0
they are really into @entity110 -- a video game where you watch the sun rise and set -- and showing them a real life version of that was great , " he said			0
