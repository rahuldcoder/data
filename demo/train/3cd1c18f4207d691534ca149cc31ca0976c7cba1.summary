-- one of two @entity2 journalists freed last year from a @entity4 prison said wednesday that their release was thanks to an expression of condolences made by former president @entity9 , to @entity4 's reclusive leader @entity10			1
" i tried to maintain hope as much as i could , " journalist @entity11 told @entity0 's " @entity13 " of being sentenced to 12 years ' hard labor along with fellow captive @entity15			1
the women were apprehended in march 2009 after crossing into @entity4 territory while reporting from the border between @entity4 and @entity19 for @entity21 - based @entity20			1
after being allowed unprecedented communication with her family in the @entity2 , including four phone calls , @entity11 was able to convey requests by her captors for a diplomatic rescue mission headed by @entity9			1
@entity11 : silence is an oath i ca n't keep " there was no deal , " @entity11 said of their release in august 2009			0
" what president @entity9 said on the plane ride home was that @entity10 told him , ' you were the first person who reached out to me when my father ... died , even before my allies			0
i 've always remembered that and i 've always respected you for that and i 've always wanted to meet you			0
' " @entity11 's sister , tv personality and journalist @entity46 , helped coordinate the effort for their release and said , " i think what @entity4 was trying to do was communicate these requests to me ( through @entity11 ) , and they saw that we were actually executing what they wanted , and so they kept upping the ante " ultimately asking for the envoy to be @entity9			1
the @entity11 sisters have written a book about the ordeal titled " @entity62 : one @entity64 's captivity in @entity4 and the @entity65 's fight to bring her home			2
" the book hit stores tuesday			0
@entity68 and @entity11 ended up spending 140 days in prison , but unlike other inmates , were allowed to receive and write letters to their families and make phone calls			1
" i think that our ability to communicate really allowed @entity4 and the @entity2 to talk more directly , " @entity46 said			2
" it 's such a circuitous way our countries communicate ... and i think they figured out that by letting @entity11 and me talk somehow they could communicate messages to our country			0
" @entity11 expressed empathy for her captors and the guards who oversaw her imprisonment saying , " i developed some very human bonds with them , ( but ) i do n't hold the same regard for the @entity4 government			2
" " i developed a better understanding for my captors and they of me , and i hope that they have a wider perspective about @entity2 and the @entity2 , " she said .			0
