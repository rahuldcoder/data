" we do n't have the right to have our opinion heard , " he said			1
he speaks during a break from a soccer game on a makeshift cement field that 's wedged in by the wall			2
the " eco-wall , " as officials call it , runs up next to his house and around most of the @entity28 shantytown where he and about 7,000 others live			2
" the state government walled us in , so more houses would n't be built in the forest , " de @entity33 said			1
" but people felt imprisoned , like they were setting borders and limiting when we could come and go			0
" the state of @entity0 began building the wall around @entity28 in march , and it plans to spend $ 17 million on similar walls around the shantytowns			1
there are nearly 1,000 such favelas -- cramped poor communities built around the city			2
the squalid homes tilt from their shaky foundations , some built on top of others			2
many are carved into the humid rainforest that cling to the hillsides			0
it 's estimated about 20 percent of @entity0 's 6 million people live in the shantytowns			1
@entity59 , director of @entity0 state 's public works , says the walls are necessary because the favelas have continued to expand by 7 percent over the last decade , making them one of the biggest causes of deforestation in the state			1
" the limits used to be virtual and now they 're physical , " he told reporters at a news conference			0

blog : postcard from @entity0 's ' pacified ' slum " they treat the people here like children who need to be corralled in , " said @entity91 , who runs her own party - organizing business in @entity28			1
" we can respect limits as well as the rich people			0
we do n't need a wall			1
" founded by squatters looking for work in the big city , shantytowns like @entity28 are not even on most maps			2
critics see the wall as a barrier between crime - ridden slums and beachside condos rather than an effort to protect the forest			1
but not everyone in @entity28 opposes the wall			0
@entity114 has lived here for 34 years and he 's seen the population explode in size , more than double what it was in the 1970s			0
he says an increased police presence and investments in projects like the wall and a funicular ( cable car on rails ) linking the steep slum to the rest of the city shows that officials are trying to improve their standard of living			1
" people are pleased because it 's going to protect the @entity135			0
protecting the environment is important , " he said from his balcony overlooking the forest			0

@entity161 , a senator from @entity1 's @entity162 , disagrees			0
" this wall is not a wall like the @entity156 , " he says			0
there is no control trying to avoid people visiting the community or leaving the community			0
" but , he says , he recommended introducing a satellite tracking system to prevent the expansion of favelas , instead of building a physical barrier			0
" it 's the difference between soft power and hard power			0

@entity0 is *erecting* walls around shantytowns to protect rainforests
residents say it amounts to social *segregation*
" the state government walled us in , so more houses would n't be built in the forest "
officials say the wall is needed to keep the regions from *spreading* further into jungle
