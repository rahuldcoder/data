-- now in its 37th year , the @entity1 has built a reputation as the mother of all music festivals , with the biggest names in rock music gladly accepting invitations to play the pyramid stage year after year			1
yet for all their combined wealth and fame , it is festival 's organizer who remains the true star of @entity1			1
festival guru @entity17 is , by his own admission , " a bit of a puritan			1
" @entity17 is the one of the most un-rock and roll people you are ever likely to meet			1
by his own admission he is " a bit of a @entity24 "			0
he worships , with his 95 year - old mum , @entity25 , at the local @entity27 chapel every sunday , and abhors drink and drugs and smoking			1
yet his twin passions for music and people inspired him to start what would grow into @entity35 's foremost music festival			2
born in 1935 , @entity17 was educated at @entity36 in @entity37			2
he left school when he was just 15 years old to join the @entity39 as a trainee midshipman			0
he spent four happy years plying the trade routes between @entity35 , @entity42 and @entity43 before , at the age of 19 , his father -- a farmer and @entity27 preacher died of cancer			0
it was initially with some reluctance that @entity17 accepted his inheritance of 150 acres , 60 cows and an overdraft , and returned from his life at sea to run @entity55			2
at the same time he embarked upon his first marriage to @entity57 , which produced three children before they divorced in 1964			0
the idea to stage a festival took seed in 1970 when @entity17 and @entity63 ( his future wife ) snuck into the @entity65 and saw @entity66 perform their set			1
@entity17 has often described that moment as an epiphany			2
" something flashes down and you suddenly change , " he said			0
later that year , on september 19th @entity17 organized a @entity72 at @entity55 charging £ 1 and offering free milk to festival goers			1
@entity75 -- who arrived in a velvet covered @entity78 car - topped the bill after @entity80 had pulled out at the last minute and although the festival made a loss of £ 1500 -- @entity17 had hoped it would pay off his mortgage and allow him to farm ecologically -- it was deemed a success			1
the following year the festival was renamed the " @entity90 " with an attendance of 12,000 and the famous pyramid stage was erected for the first time			0
after the " impromptu " festival in 1978 , where 500 travelers arrived unannounced from @entity94 , the festival began to regain momentum			0
by 1981 , it was officially called the " @entity1 " and began its attachments with political and charitable causes			2
the @entity100 benefited to the tune of £ 20,000 and by the end of the decade @entity104 , @entity105 and local charities were all benefiting from donations			1
but by now , @entity17 was facing annual opposition from local residents and the district council who threatened to revoke the festival 's entertainment license			1
matters came to a head in 1990 when travelers , who were looting the site clashed with security guards resulting in 235 arrests and £ 50,000 of damage to property			0
the rest of the decade proved more peaceful and crowds soared to over 100,000 , but the millennium would close on a tragic note for @entity17 when his wife and mother of the festival , @entity129 , died of cancer in 1999			1
a wicker sculpture was ceremoniously burned in her honor and fireworks illuminated the sky			0
in 2002 the festival underwent the biggest overhaul since it 's conception			2
steel fencing ringed the site and music event 's organizer @entity140 took over the running of ticketing and security , successfully stopping troublemakers and ticketless fans from entering the site			2
some people accused @entity1 of selling out and caving in to consumerism , but without such measures it would never gain it 's license			1
far from denting its popularity , the festival has gone from strength to strength with a record 180,000 people attending in 2007			1
@entity17 will raise £ 2m for charity this year with @entity104 , @entity158 , @entity105 , i count and a range of local charities all benefiting from the festival			1
the 2007 finished as usual , with people shouting their thanks to @entity165			0
covered in mud , they all joyfully tell him what a fantastic time they have had			0
@entity17 receives the praise graciously			0
he signed off his post-festival message on the @entity1 web site saying : " if i ever needed encouragement to carry on , you have all given me loads of it			0
thank you again for everything			0
" for now , it 's time for @entity17 to go back to farming and look forward to 2008 .			0

@entity17 , who abhors drink and drugs , has *hosted* the festival since 1970
charities such as @entity105 and @entity104 have had @entity1 donations
since 2002 the festival was ringed by a metal fence
