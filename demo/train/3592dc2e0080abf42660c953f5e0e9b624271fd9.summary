first came word of a woman stabbed			2
but the full story of thursday 's gruesome beheading at an @entity5 food processing plant -- especially why it happened -- is still waiting to be told			1
one day later , there are tears for @entity8 , the 54 - year - old woman whose head was severed			1
there are prayers for 43 - year - old @entity12 , who is in stable condition at a nearby hospital for treatment of " numerous wounds , " according to police			1
and there are questions about 30 - year - old @entity20 , the man who authorities say attacked them both and might have gone after more people if not for the company 's ceo , also an off - duty reserve sheriff 's deputy , who confronted and shot him twice			1
answers may come from @entity20 himself			1
as of 6 p.m. ( 7 p.m. et ) , he was " coming out of a sedation " at a hospital and investigators planned " to attempt to begin interviewing him as soon as he was coherent enough to understand what was going on , " according to sgt. @entity31 of the @entity32			1
here 's what they do know : the attack happened very soon after @entity20 learned he 'd lost his job			1
@entity20 had been incarcerated until march 2013 , for possession of a controlled substance , escaping confinement and resisting an officer			1
and he had been trying to convert co-workers to @entity45			1
@entity31 also said there may be other information about @entity20 's past , that he could not reveal , that might help explain the incident , and that the @entity51 had been called in to dig deeper into @entity20 's background			1
" once we started investigating this initially , and started finding some of the things that he had been involved in , some of the things that he had been saying , we immediately contacted the @entity51 and got them involved , " @entity31 told @entity54 's @entity53			2
ceo / reserve sheriff 's deputy stops attack the large , rectangular @entity64 processing plant looks like many others from the outside : a no - frills design , nondescript front entrance and loading bays out back			1
but friday , there was nothing normal about it			0
police cars were everywhere , and uniformed officers walked the property			0
some citizens stood outside watching , putting their arms around each other and trying to make sense of the horror the day before			0
some of this drama could be heard in a 911 call released friday by the city of @entity84			0
it starts with a man yelling out , " shut the doors , " before calmly turning his attention to a 911 dispatcher			2
" we have someone attacking someone in the building , " he says			0
the initial violence happened near the @entity64 plant 's main entrance , but did n't stop there			2
according to a 911 call , the suspect went through the front office , to the shipping office , then over to a customer service office			2
did he know who he was attacking ? not according to @entity31 , who said the suspect used a knife -- which , otherwise , would be used in the processing of produce at the plant -- to randomly inflict bloodshed			2
" he was n't targeting anyone , was n't going specifically after them , " the police spokesman said			0
" it appears they were just in his way as he came in			0
" the onslaught 's end could be heard on the 911 call , when the caller 's steady voice was interrupted			0
" can you hear this in the background ? " he tells the dispatcher			0
" and that , that 's a gunshot			0
" three shots rang out in total , according to the caller			0
there 's no indication that the suspect , @entity20 , was armed with anything other than a knife			1
of course , no one knew that at the time : they only knew that someone had entered their workplace , beheaded one woman , then attacked another			1
@entity142 -- who besides being his company 's ceo has been a reserve deputy with the @entity145 since june 2010 -- " did n't hesitate " after learning that there was a killer on the loose , sheriff @entity141 said in a statement			2
instead , he confronted and twice shot @entity20 , who is now hospitalized in stable condition			2
" without regard to himself or his safety , " @entity141 said , " yesterday @entity142 became a ' hero ' while doing the job he was sworn to do -- protecting others			0
" beheading raises questions , but officials say no terror link the idea that a man who 's been trying to convert others to @entity45 ends up beheading someone is alarming enough , but perhaps even more given what has been happening in the @entity164			1
the @entity166 extremist group @entity165 has made a name for its itself using such tactics , going so far as to record the beheadings of @entity173 journalists @entity171 and @entity174 as well as @entity176 aid worker @entity175			0
and they 've threatened more to come , especially if the @entity173 and its allies continue to launch airstrikes at the group in @entity181 and @entity182			0
this has spurred concerns that @entity165 sympathizers may similarly lash out against innocents in the @entity187			0
that said , it 's not known if @entity20 's religion had anything , at all , to do with what happened thursday			1
the @entity51 and other investigators , of course , could eventually find some sort of link or tie @entity20 to others			2
but that has n't happened yet			0
as of friday , all @entity173 law enforcement officials said was that there are no indications linking the @entity84 attack to terrorism			0
a spokesman for @entity5 gov. @entity205 , @entity206 , noted the governor had blocked @entity20 from receiving parole in 2012 , but said she " believes we need to let law enforcement do their job and not to jump to any conclusions before the conclusion of the investigation			1

@entity5 governor warns against " jumping to conclusions "
suspect in beheading , @entity20 , was a recent convert to @entity45
suspect is in a hospital and will be interviewed once he 's " coherent enough , " he adds
the man *allegedly* beheaded a woman , attacked another ; an off - deputy deputy stopped him
