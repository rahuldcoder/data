" he wanted me to send him some money to get him to @entity17			2
" the elder @entity1 said he was n't sure how @entity1 would make it all the way to page , but his son mentioned following the river			1
within a week of his call home , @entity1 got a ride to where @entity59 crosses the river , and set out on his journey			1

he was casually eating a granola bar as he was talking to the deputy , " said @entity19			1
in a statement , @entity83 said he had not been expecting a good outcome			0
" we had no idea if @entity1 had stayed along the river , or decided to leave , or got a ride with someone , or was lost somewhere other than along the river , " he said			2
" we flew along it without any expectation of finding anything at all			0
the conditions would have to be just right too ; unless he was out in the open there was no way we would be able to find him			0
" @entity83 , praised by @entity1 's family for his work on the case , did not immediately return a message left friday by @entity0			2
@entity140 was in an area popular with hikers , but was about 30 miles beyond where most venture , @entity19 said			0
