-- vampires and their stories seem to be enjoying an eternal renaissance in contemporary fiction and film			2
@entity16 's " @entity15 " kicked off the modern raft of tales , and the popularity of more recent book and movie offerings like " @entity11 " and " @entity14 " shows that folks are , well , batty for vampire tales			1
so where can you go to learn more about these creatures of the night ? discover the top destinations with this excerpt from @entity23 's @entity22			2
@entity24 , @entity25 there 's nothing better than going to the source , and in the case of vampire lore that 's @entity31 , legendary ruler of @entity32 , now part of @entity25			1
@entity31 became the scourge of the @entity36 empire and was fond of impaling entire @entity38 forces sent against him			2
his bloodthirsty reputation inspired @entity42 author @entity41 to use him as the model for " @entity44 , " and thus a legend was born			1
@entity24 , one of his strongholds , now houses a museum dedicated to @entity51 @entity50			1
it has an impressive clifftop profile , looking like the quintessential location for a vampire movie			1
@entity56 , @entity57 the vampire bat has become inseparable from the legend of the vampire			1
apparently inspired by a newspaper article about these inhabitants of @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity41 wove their blood - sucking habits into his novel and the rest is history ( or at least , folklore )			1
these small bats do feed on animals ' blood but rarely suck on humans , though there have been reported attacks in recent years in @entity76 and @entity77			2
one of the best places to see them in the wild is @entity57 , especially within @entity80 and @entity81			2
@entity23 : how to travel like a kid @entity83 , @entity84 hidden away in the @entity86 district of @entity87 is an enigmatic museum devoted to the vampire			1
visits can only be made by appointment , but once through the forbidding red door , the visitor is treated to an eclectic collection of books , photographs , weapons , masks , models , costumes and other curios referencing the vampire legend			1
there 's also a creepy @entity105 garden out the back			2
@entity109 , @entity110 when author @entity112 set her vampire novel " @entity11 " in the small town of @entity109 , @entity110 , she had little idea of the wave of vampire tourism she was setting in motion			1
when " twilight " went ballistic on the bookshelves , ardent fans headed for @entity109 , neatly arresting the slow economic decline caused by its traditional mainstay , the timber industry , losing momentum			1
now vampire fans can buy undead memorabilia , go on tours to locations that resemble @entity130 and @entity132 's literary hangouts , and celebrate @entity132 's birthday on 13 september			1
dazzled by @entity11 offers three twilight - themed tours of @entity109 and @entity135			1
@entity136 of @entity137 anyone who 's read @entity44 will remember @entity139 , whom @entity44 attacked with the intent of transforming her into a vampire			1
given that this curse was apparently lifted once he was destroyed , you might be surprised to find @entity139 wafting about in 21st - century @entity137 , and sporting an @entity146 accent			2
but every weekend you can join @entity139 for a vampire tour of the city 's historic @entity148			1
it covers documented @entity137 history as well as speculative supernatural events , and attendees are encouraged to dress spookily			2
the @entity136 of @entity137 commences at 8 p.m. each friday and saturday			2
@entity154 of @entity155 , @entity156 given the @entity156 capital 's starring role in the original @entity44 novel , it makes sense that there should be a vampire tour of its darker nooks and crannies			1
this supernatural outing takes in a house in @entity169 where the vampiric one apparently lived during his @entity155 sojourn			2
it also takes in the ghosts of @entity174 , the satanists of @entity176 , and other dark denizens			2
curiously , the whole thing is then followed with a medieval banquet			0
blood , presumably , is not on the menu			0
the @entity154 of @entity155 , run by @entity181 , takes place nightly except mondays			0
@entity183 , @entity184 vampiric creatures are n't just a @entity187 obsession			0
@entity188 and @entity184 share the legend of the pontianak , supposedly the undead manifestation of a woman who has died during childbirth			0
this supernatural being is said to take the form of a beautiful woman , attracting men to their deaths by disemboweling them with her razor - sharp fingernails			0
you would n't really want to encounter one of these hellhounds , but if feeling brave you might visit the city of @entity183 , said to be named after the undead creature which once terrorized its men			0
@entity183 is the capital of the @entity184 province of @entity207 , on the island of @entity209			0
@entity23 : hotels where famous people have died @entity44 's haunts , @entity213 , @entity156 before " @entity44 " reached @entity155 in the pages of @entity41 's novel , he came ashore at @entity213			1
the @entity217 seaport is famous for being the home base of 18th - century explorer captain @entity219			0
however , no amount of historic circumstance can top @entity41 's evocative description of the @entity225 schooner @entity223 blown across @entity213 's harbour with its dead captain lashed to the helm , crashing beneath the @entity229 before disgorging the vampire in the guise of a huge dog			1
as a result , @entity213 has become a popular destination for vampire - fanciers			1
the @entity236 is held twice - yearly , in april and october , and features concerts , markets and comedy nights			1
" @entity241 " locations , @entity146 " @entity241 " gained vampires a big new tv audience in the 1990s			0
if you loved seeing @entity246 stake scowly - faced evil vampires while finding time to fall in love with a reformed one then you might like to visit the locations in and around @entity251 where the series was filmed			0
the series ' exterior scenes at @entity255 were in fact filmed at @entity257			0
shots of the fictional @entity259 at @entity255 were taken at the @entity261 campus in @entity262 , and at @entity263 in @entity264			0
and the vampire mansion once lived in by @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 is the @entity269 -- designed @entity270 near @entity271			1

" " @entity14 " locations , @entity146 @entity278 , @entity279 , is the fictional town in " @entity14 , " the rightful heir to the vampire - mania stoked by @entity241			1
as with @entity241 , the main character of the show is female , @entity285 , who , like @entity241 , falls in love with vampires			0
unlike @entity241 , vampires no longer hide from mainstream society -- they have ' come out of the coffin ' to drink a synthetic human blood ( @entity14 )			0
but vampires are n't the only supernatural citizens of @entity278			0
werewolves , werepanthers , faeries , shapeshifters and maenads also roam its streets			0
while all the human characters in the series pass through @entity304 's @entity303 , the vampires of the show frequent @entity14 , a bar owned by the thousand - year - old vampire @entity308 in @entity309 , @entity279			2
the actual bar used for some of the filming is located in @entity313 , @entity314 , so if you want to be a fang banger then head to @entity317			0
