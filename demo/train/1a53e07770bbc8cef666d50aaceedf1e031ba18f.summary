-- while the presidential candidates spar in debates and jump on gaffes , two possibly historic votes on november 6 will cut to the most primal issues : nothing less than death and love			2
in @entity10 , voters will decide whether to keep the death penalty on the books in @entity14 's most populous state			1
meanwhile , in my own state of @entity18 , there is a good chance that a proposed constitutional amendment to bar same - sex marriage will be defeated			2
each is significant because it could represent a crucial shift in momentum and a turning point â € ” away from the use of the death penalty , and toward a broader societal acceptance of gay men and women			1
the death penalty law in @entity10 is a mess			1
it is expensive in a time of fiscal crisis , and simply does n't work			0
@entity10 has by far the largest death row in the nation , with more than 700 residents ( @entity40 is next with about 400 ) , yet it has only executed 13 people since 1976			2
if @entity10 sensibly reject continuing this failed death penalty approach , it will join five other states that have also recently abolished capital punishment : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
@entity10 's action would have two principle effects			2
first , it could lead to a reconsideration of the soundness of the death penalty in other states where it is seldom used , including @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
@entity10 is a trendsetter and it will be meaningful when the state with the largest death row gives up the cost and moral burden of capital punishment			0
second , it would be a large step toward a new challenge to the death penalty under the @entity75			1
since the 1980s , the @entity76 has looked to trends in the states to evaluate where national standards are regarding what punishments are " cruel and unusual			0
" in fact , such an analysis led to a constitutional ban on the death penalty in cases where the defendant committed the crime as a juvenile or suffered a mental defect			1
moving @entity10 to the abolition side would commit a large fraction of the @entity14 population to leaning away from the death penalty			1
it may well be that the best way to get rid of the death penalty in @entity99 is to abolish it in @entity10			1
while @entity10 considers the state 's ability to kill its citizens , @entity18 will decide an issue related to love			1
while @entity18 is not a population giant , the symbolic value of the upcoming referendum on same - sex marriage in that state has huge symbolic importance			0
the proposed amendment would insert into the @entity113 a definition of marriage as between one man and one woman ( the state 's statutes already contain this definition )			0
some 30 states ( most recently @entity122 ) have already amended their constitutions to include similar language			0
three other states â € ” @entity126 , @entity60 and @entity61 â € ” are voting on whether to allow same - sex marriage ( essentially the opposite question from the one posed in @entity18 )			0
the @entity18 vote is perhaps the most significant , though , because it could break the unbeaten streak of those who have pushed bans on same - sex marriage into state constitutions			2
it would reflect an overextension of that effort and a crucial shift going the other way			0
right now , polling on the @entity18 marriage amendment is roughly even , while @entity10 polls show death penalty abolitionists behind			1
the remaining weeks will be crucial in each contest			0
history often moves when we are n't watching , and political epochs rarely align with elections			0
rather , @entity14 sometimes change their consensus over time , and nearly always there was a noticeable swing in momentum at a time we can name			0
for example , with the civil rights movement , it was not a presidential election that marked a turning point , but something as simple as a brave woman on a bus			2
should the people of @entity10 and @entity18 choose less death and more love , respectively , this , too , could be one of those moments			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

voters in @entity10 will decide on death penalty and those in @entity18 on gay marriage
@entity169 : each is significant because it could represent a turning point in history
@entity169 : let 's see if @entity10 and @entity182 choose less death and more love
