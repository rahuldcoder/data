books , filled with prayers for peace , splattered with blood			0
sacred vestments shredded by bullets and knives			0
lifeless bodies in the sanctuary			0
the rabbis had gathered to ask @entity11 to bestow blessings upon their troubled land			2
their prayers were interrupted by two men wielding butcher knives and a gun			0
an @entity19 police officer and four rabbis were killed , including an @entity21 whose family is considered " rabbinic royalty			1
" combined with the site of the slaughter -- a synagogue in @entity29 -- the targeting of rabbis struck at the soul of @entity25 around the world , several @entity25 leaders said tuesday			1
" this is an attack on all of us , " said rabbi @entity34 , who leads @entity35 in @entity36			2
" any terrorist attack is a horror			1
but to attack people while they are engaged in prayer , are talking to @entity11 , is a new low			1
" in fact , both sides in the seemingly endless fight between @entity19 and @entity46 have attacked people at prayer			2
in 1994 , a @entity25 extremist murdered 29 @entity46 worshiping in @entity49			1
in 2002 , @entity46 extremists attacked a @entity51 in @entity52 , killing 30			2
like those assaults , tuesday 's murders threaten to ignite another inferno of unholy violence			0
@entity58 president @entity57 condemned the attack , but @entity60 and other @entity46 praised the terrorists , identified by police as two cousins from @entity64			2
@entity19 prime minister @entity66 's office vowed to " respond with a heavy hand " to the killings			0
the attackers , identified as @entity71 and his cousin @entity72 , were killed by police responding to the synagogue assault , authorities said			0
@entity75 , a spokesman for @entity60 , linked the attack to the discovery sunday of a @entity46 bus driver hanged in his bus not far from the synagogue where the rabbis were killed			1
but relatives of the terrorists told the @entity84 the men were motivated by @entity19 's recent closure of @entity29 's @entity88 / @entity88 compound , a site holy to both @entity25 and @entity90			1
the site has since been reopened , but the dispute has fueled small - scale attacks by @entity46 that have killed six @entity19 in recent weeks			0
in the @entity21 , the horror of tuesday 's terror attack unified @entity25 across the political spectrum , even those who sharply disagree with @entity66 's handling of the @entity19 - @entity46 crisis			1
in an editorial , the @entity99 said the frustration of @entity46 " living under occupation " is understandable			0
but killing innocent men at prayer is morally indefensible , the newspaper said , noting that the synagogue is in @entity29 , not in " contested territory			2
" killing innocents anywhere is detestable , @entity25 leaders said tuesday			1
but there is something especially heinous about killing people while they pray			1
" we look on our ministers , priests , rabbis and mullahs as intermediaries between ourselves in the divine world , " said @entity113 , a professor of @entity114 at @entity115			1
within the slain rabbis ' @entity125 tradition , respected rabbis are assumed to have a " hot line to heaven			2
" " so an attack on them is a little closer to being an attack on @entity11 , " @entity113 said			2
the four rabbis killed were : @entity133 , 58 ; @entity134 , 43 ; @entity135 , 59 ; and @entity136			0
@entity133 was a dual @entity137 - @entity19 citizen , and the other three were @entity21 - @entity19 citizens			1
" this was an attack by @entity46 terrorists of pure evil and would have been utterly deplorable wherever , whenever it had occurred , " said rabbi @entity139 , the former chief of rabbi of @entity137			0
" but for this terrorist attack to occur in a synagogue , deliberately targeting innocent @entity25 deep in prayer , is something that strikes at the soul of @entity25 people around the world			1
" @entity153 condemns ' horrific ' @entity29 terror attack the @entity155 also condemned tuesday 's attack			0
" we strongly believe that houses of worship should be a sanctuary for all people , not a place of violence as we regretfully witnessed today			1
@entity90 commands its followers to protect houses of worship , " the group said in a statement on @entity166			1
@entity135 , originally from @entity169 , comes from an almost @entity171 - like clan of respected scholars and rabbis			0
his father , rabbi @entity174 , was a world - renowned expert on @entity25 theology and founding director of @entity178 for @entity25 learning			1
@entity135 's maternal grandfather was rabbi @entity181 , a philosopher and professor at @entity183 who was considered one of the most important minds in @entity186			0
" it 's a very prominent family in @entity25 life , in @entity25 scholarship , in @entity25 theology , " @entity113 said			1
@entity34 said @entity181 was responsible for training thousands of rabbis who passed through @entity183 in @entity193 , where his legacy still burns bright			0
@entity135 's brother , @entity195 , teaches at the university			0
family legacy aside , what makes tuesday 's attack all the more galling , @entity25 leaders said , is that the rabbis planned to engage in the very opposite of terrorism : praying for peace			1
" that 's what 's so horrible about this , " said @entity34			0
" these people were trying to do their part to bring good into this world through their dedication to @entity11			1
" ' grief and outrage ' at @entity29 synagogue slayings other @entity25 leaders noted that the rabbis likely did not expect their morning service to be interrupted by an assault			1
" if you are truly at prayer , you are most vulnerable , " said @entity218 , the forward 's editor - in - chief			0
worshipers are not looking around for potential terrorists ; they are focused on @entity11			0
during the central prayer of @entity25 services , the @entity228 , it is considered sacrilegious to interrupt worshipers			2
" @entity228 " means " standing " in @entity114 , and @entity25 are taught to imagine themselves standing before @entity11 , asking for his blessing , said @entity34			2
by tradition , the last prayer asks for peace in @entity19			0
it 's unclear whether the rabbis had reached that point when the slaughter began .			0

killing of rabbis strikes at soul of @entity25 around the world , @entity25 leaders say
in the @entity21 , the horror of the attack unifies @entity25 across the political spectrum
something especially heinous about killing people while they pray , leaders say
*muslims* also condemn attack , saying followers of @entity90 must protect houses of worship
