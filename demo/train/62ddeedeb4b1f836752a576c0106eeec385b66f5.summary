@entity0 may have scored the go - ahead goal for the @entity2 in what would ultimately be a gut - wrenching tie with @entity5 in sunday 's @entity7 game			1
but on social media , @entity9 star @entity8 was three times as popular as the @entity2 striker			1
@entity8 , considered the best soccer player in the world by some , was mentioned on @entity16 1.5 million times during the @entity2 - @entity5 match , compared to 465,000 mentions for @entity0			1
of course , the word " popular " is probably relative to most @entity2 , after @entity8 lobbed a perfect crossing pass to help create the last - minute goal that prevented the @entity2 from advancing to the @entity7 's next round , at least for now			1
" i feel like someone ( @ @entity8 ) just punched me and my babies in the gut ! " @entity28 placekicker @entity27 wrote			0
30 seconds away from advancing ! still , we control our own destiny ... # @entity33 , " tweeted pop star @entity30			0
sunday 's match was a high point in a @entity7 that 's already shattering social - media records			1
@entity37 says 10 million people had 20 million interactions during the @entity2 - @entity5 match			1
according to @entity42 , there were 8 million tweets about the match while it was happening			1
by itself , that 's no match for the 24.9 million tweets during this year 's @entity49 ( including pregame , halftime and postgame )			2
but , taken as a whole , the @entity7 , bolstered by its massive international appeal and growing popularity in the @entity2 , is becoming the biggest social - media event in the medium 's short history			1
the @entity7 's opening match , between host country @entity60 and @entity61 , spurred 12.2 million tweets alone -- possibly not surprising when you consider that soccer - crazy @entity60 has the fifth-most @entity16 users in the world , behind the @entity2 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			1
the tournament 's first week , june 12 to 18 , spurred 459 million posts , likes and comments on @entity37 , according to the company			0
compare that to 185 million interactions about the @entity49 , 120 million for the @entity77 and 25.4 million for the @entity78 in march , and you realize the @entity7 inspired more activity than the other three combined			0
" sporting events always drive a massive amount of conversation on @entity37 , but what we 've seen so far during the @entity7 has been extraordinary , " a @entity37 spokesman said in an e-mail			0
" @entity37 and the @entity7 are both fundamentally global , and we knew that @entity37 would become a global , mobile stadium where people connect and engage during the tournament			0
it turned out to be a unique moment for us , and one that has seen the highest level of conversation for any event @entity37 has ever measured			2
" both @entity37 and @entity16 saw the deluge of soccer - related activity coming and launched tools to encourage it			2
in addition to letting users choose their favorite nation 's flag as their avatar , @entity16 has created a dedicated # worldcup feed featuring tweets from selected clubs , media outlets , players and even @entity110 , the international soccer governing body			0
it has also added " hashflags			0
" when a user tweets the hashtag for a @entity7 team -- # @entity2 or # @entity116 , for example -- the nation 's flag will appear as an image beside it			2
@entity120 has created a similar one - stop home for the tournament , trending @entity7			0
in addition to top posts , your friends ' updates about the @entity7 also will appear in the feed .			0
