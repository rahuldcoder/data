-- @entity1 has only produced two @entity3 champions , but they are two of the greatest drivers the sport has ever known -- and they can thank one man for spotting their nascent talent			0
@entity9 and @entity10 have won 11 world titles between them , winning renown across the globe for their record - breaking feats			1
and the story of their success started in the small town of @entity21 , where @entity22 is known as the man who finds champions at the local go - kart club			1
it was at this innocuous circuit , carved out of an old gravel pit , that @entity22 first spotted the potential of @entity1 's two giants of motorsport			1
but his involvement in karting happened almost by accident			0
" i got to know the @entity9 family , the father and mother , " @entity22 explained to @entity0 's @entity35 in a rare television interview			1
" that 's when i first really found out about kart sport			0
" that way i also met @entity9 , and i enjoyed it so much , us both being in motorsport , that i stuck with it			2
" @entity9 grew up in @entity21 , where he graduated from a homemade kart at the age of four to become the benchmark for @entity3			1
the 44 - year - old , who began his @entity3 career in 1991 , won a record seven world championships before retiring for a second time more than 20 years after his debut season			1
it is a little ironic that after being introduced to karting by the @entity9 family , @entity22 would go on to mentor the man who is already well on the road to usurping @entity9 's place in @entity3 history			1
@entity10 -- dubbed " @entity62 " when he made his @entity3 debut seven years ago -- has already won four consecutive world titles with @entity64 and collected several of the old maestro 's racing records in the process			1
all this at the age of just 26 -- no wonder @entity22 saw his potential as @entity9 's successor			1
" @entity10 was not the first great talent after @entity9 , " explained @entity22 , who also coached a generation of @entity1 @entity3 racers that included @entity74 , @entity76 - @entity75 and @entity77			1
" there are many great race drivers that all came from this club but @entity10 was the first one where i felt a special connection			2
" he 's got something that @entity9 has too , a very special personality , great will and a lot of talent , and that led me to decide to look after him in that way			1
" the first time i saw @entity10 was in 1996			2
he was a bambini driver and racing in @entity21			2
" we were watching a race particularly closely and it was in the rain			0
some of the drivers had changed to rain tires , @entity10 continued to drive with slicks ( dry weather tires )			2
" he was very dominant compared to the others even without rain tires , and that impressed me so much that i said i want to give it another go and see if i can manage this young driver to get into @entity3			0
" after the long gap between @entity9 and @entity10 , i just decided to approach the @entity10 family and try to support such a young driver			1
" @entity22 decided to temporarily rent out his business to help guide @entity10 's career or , in his own words , " smooth the way for him			1
" " after all those years in motorsport i knew a few important people and , thank god , we were lucky to always find the right people at the right time to support @entity10 , " the businessman explained			2
" i myself was his mechanic , his coach , all those things that you need in karting			0
we went to the races together , we lived together , at the weekends at least , and the family was always there , too			0
" i did everything that was needed also to sort out the financial background , to find the right people and the right sponsors , and luckily we always did			0
" those connections helped him sign @entity10 to @entity64 's junior academy at the age of 13			1
after a stint as a reserve for the @entity141 team , the young racer began his first full season in @entity3 with @entity64 's junior @entity144 team in 2008			2
this year @entity10 became one of just four men to win the @entity3 world title four times , and @entity22 predicts his former charge could one day surpass all @entity9 has achieved			1
" i believe that @entity10 will certainly be able to get the seven titles , " @entity22 said			1
" but a lot depends on whether the team he 's with at the time is competitive			2
. " at the moment there really is no need to change the team			0
@entity64 are great , it 's where the best people are , and he proves it at every race			0
" at some point he might change the team			0
i think in the next few years there is no question about it			0
" @entity9 , who won his world titles with @entity171 and @entity172 , recently conceded in an interview with his former @entity175 team that he is happy for @entity10 to take over his mantle			1
" if someone can break all these records then i prefer him to do it than somebody else , " said @entity9 , who @entity10 cited as his inspiration growing up			1
" i did what i did in my time and he 's doing it in his time -- i 'm glad it is him in the end			2
" @entity9 bowed out of the @entity3 spotlight at the end of 2012 after a second career with the @entity191 , and revealed since his retirement that he too has been helping find the next generation of racing stars			0
" i 'm looking after young drivers in the go - kart area , " explained @entity9 , who occasionally returns to @entity21 to drop in on his racing alma mater			1
@entity10 is likely to be in the spotlight for many years to come , but he too stays in touch with his roots -- and the man who helped his talent grow			2
" the last time we talked in person was at the @entity204 ( home of the @entity1 @entity205 ) , " revealed @entity22			2
" since he won his fourth title we have only been able to speak on the phone			0
i hope we will have time again to go out for a meal or have time for a longer chat			0
" we have very little time for each other , but that will improve in the winter months			0
" and does @entity22 see a changein the boy who has become @entity64 's all - conquering racer ? " he has grown up , that 's the only thing that 's changed about him , " @entity22 reflected			1
" other than that he is , in my view at least , still the same @entity10 that he was when he was eight years old			0
i never notice that anything much has changed about him			0
" he always worked hard , and above all , he has the will to persevere , always challenging his opponents , and ultimately winning			0
" that 's always been the case with him and you can still see that in him today			0
all that and he still remains down to earth			0
" the same could be said of @entity22			0
he may have nurtured two racing superstars but he is content in @entity21 , running his karting business -- and keeping one eye on track for the next racing prodigy .			1

@entity9 and @entity10 were both nurtured by the same man
they were guided in their junior careers by @entity22 in the town of @entity21
@entity22 was introduced to karting through his *friendship* with the @entity9 family
he says four - time champion @entity10 will *eclipse* @entity9 's record seven titles
