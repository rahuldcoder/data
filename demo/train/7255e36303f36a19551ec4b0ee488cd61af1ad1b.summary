-- the judicial equivalent of white smoke has risen : the @entity3 has ruled in a split decision rejecting most of @entity6 's controversial immigration policing law , @entity5			1
many were expecting a tough ruling favoring the @entity6 statute and opening the floodgates to states ' rights			1
and so the majority opinion is surprising as it upholds the federal government 's power in setting immigration policy , leaving less room than many anticipated for state immigration enforcement			1
decision and issues at a glance the justices upheld the provision of most concern to immigrant rights advocates , requiring police to check the immigration status of people they stop for other reasons if the officers suspect that they are in the country illegally			2
but even that part of the opinion is tenuous , and it 's far from certain what will happen next			0
maybe it 's a coincidence , but the court 's hesitance to open the door to more state immigration enforcement is consistent with a new mood emerging in the states and nationally			1
winners , losers in immigration policy debate ? the past six years saw a federalist revolution in immigration lawmaking , with states taking more power into their own hands every year			1
but the mood in most state houses was strikingly different this spring , with lawmakers much less focused on immigration and in much less of a hurry to crack down			1
read the immigration ruling ( @entity57 ) according to the @entity59 , state lawmakers considered far fewer bills mentioning immigration : halfway through the legislative sessions , in march , the number was down by 44 %			1
only two or three states seriously considered far - reaching enforcement measures , and no state enacted a new law			2
( @entity68 revised an existing law , mostly softening it			0
) most surprising , no state took advantage of the opening created by last year 's @entity3 immigration decision , the ruling that states may act to prevent and punish the hiring of unauthorized immigrants , requiring employers to enroll in the federal e-verify worker identification program			1
most observers expected that ruling too to encourage a host of imitators			2
in fact , nothing happened ; not a single state enacted a law mandating e-verify for any new employers			0
opinion : an incomplete win for @entity92 ? developments in recent weeks suggest that the public 's views , too , may be shifting			0
president @entity92 's surprise announcement that immigration authorities will not deport up to a million young people brought to the country illegally as children has met with an astonishing reaction : approval by voters and acquiescence , if not support , among @entity105			0
neither @entity106 nor @entity105 leaders in @entity108 have denounced the order			0
a poll by @entity111 found that nearly two - thirds of the public are in favor			0
and some courageous @entity105 -- including influential former @entity116 gov. @entity115 -- have endorsed the policy , if not the way it was issued , by partisan fiat			0
it 's no secret what 's behind this jockeying , by @entity124 or @entity105 : the outsized role the @entity127 vote is likely to play in november , determining the outcome in several swing states and perhaps the next president			0
but as significant in the past week has been the broader public 's easy acceptance of the @entity92 order , a new climate already creating new room to maneuver in @entity108			0
@entity3 mostly rejects @entity6 immigration law ; gov says ' heart ' remains the fight over who should make immigration law , @entity142 or the states , is far from over			1
but today 's ruling , seemingly consistent with a new mood taking hold nationwide , is a stunning reversal of recent trends			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			2

@entity150 : many expected court to favor @entity6 law
she says ruling fits in with emerging mood toward immigration in states , nationally
she says unlike in previous years , states are in no hurry on immigration *crackdowns*
@entity150 : with " @entity168 " move , @entity165 gaining *political* power , is trend reversing ?
