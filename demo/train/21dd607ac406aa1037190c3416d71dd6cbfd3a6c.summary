@entity0 , @entity1 it is early afternoon on board the " @entity5 , " and the @entity7 sun is already starting to set			2
near the back of the ship , two people dressed in orange rain slickers are anxiously waiting			2
any minute now , the ship 's lines will pull taut , and a green mesh bag will be back up on deck			2
when that time comes , a sigh of relief as crewmembers empty out the full bag onto the deck			2
stepping forward are @entity22 , a cell biologist , and @entity24 , a marine biologist			2
the pile of dirt , sea sponges , and starfish from the ocean floor are what they came all this way for			0
above the @entity34 in the @entity35 of northern @entity1 , researchers on the " @entity5 " are searching for the next generation of antibiotics			1
in these sea organisms , they hope , are new bacteria to become those drugs			1
" if no one finds new antibiotics for common infections , what will happen is we will go back to the pre-antibiotic age in which a simple cut could turn into an infection that becomes deadly , " said @entity41			1
@entity41 is the founder of the @entity51 project , an @entity53 - funded initiative to bring research groups together around the world in search of new antibiotics			1
the @entity58 says antibiotic resistance is a growing health crisis around the world , calling it " an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society			1
" it is not cost - effective for pharmaceutical companies to search for new antibiotics			1
on average , it costs a pharmaceutical company more than $ 2 billion to bring a new drug to market			0
in the case of antibiotics , the drug is only taken for a short time , and could eventually develop resistance			1
that 's why large - scale focus has moved away from antibiotics research in the past 30 years			1
in the meantime , bacteria have evolved , adapted , and become resistant to many current antibiotics			1
" what was once common treatments are no longer treatable by using standard antibiotics , " @entity83 said			1
the key is finding new chemistry			1
bacteria ca n't be resistant to a drug if they 've never seen anything like it before			1
extreme environments are providing new places to look			0
" in the past , bacteria and fungi have been the main sources for new antibiotics , " @entity41 explained			1
" in fact , about 70 % of our antibiotics still come from nature , normally from sediment samples and soil samples from land			1
but now , by looking at the ocean , we hope to find new life forms which give us new chemistry that might be able to treat bacterial infections			0
" that 's exactly why @entity110 and @entity24 are on board the " @entity5			0
" they are part of @entity41 ' @entity51 team , and they have identified the icy waters of the @entity1 @entity7 as a potential breeding ground of new bacteria			1
in this extreme environment , the sea organisms have been forced to adapt over time			0
" they have to adjust for very different temperatures as compared to other parts of the world , " @entity110 said			0
" we think that since they are living in an extreme environment , they have developed some extreme strategies to survive			0
" @entity110 and @entity24 take their finds from the bottom of the sea straight to a wet lab on the ship			0
it is critical to begin testing as soon as possible , ensuring freshness of the organisms			0
@entity24 cuts open the starfish , while @entity110 makes solutions to be plated on a petri dish			0
in a few weeks , bacteria will grow on the plates , hopefully exhibiting antibacterial properties			2
it is a long and tedious process , with no time to waste			0
it often takes upwards of a decade for new drugs to be approved			0
" it 's a rush against time , " @entity110 said			0
" i think we have to speed up the process of trying to find novel antibiotics			2
at the moment , a lot of the antibiotics out there are working in the same way			2
" the early results are promising			0
several compounds being tested in @entity1 and at @entity83 ' lab in @entity163 are showing initial signs of antibacterial properties			0
a good start , with a long way to go , but @entity41 knows the hopeful legacy of the @entity51 project and others like is around the world is to eradicate the issue of antibiotic resistance			1
who knows where the next penicillin will be found ? perhaps , it will be in the icy @entity1 @entity7			0
" it is always very exciting when you get to the stage where you are the first person to see a bacteria , " said @entity41 , " or the first person to identify the structure of a new molecule that has the potential at that moment , to be a treatment for a difficult disease			2

researchers are looking for new bacteria in @entity34
new bacteria could be key to creating new antibiotics
