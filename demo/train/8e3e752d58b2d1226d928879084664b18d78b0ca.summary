it 's one of the @entity2 's bigger rivalries , the @entity3 vs. the @entity4			1
and intentional or not , sunday 's game occurs during @entity8 weekend , deepening the meaning of a fresh conflict about whether " @entity4 " slurs @entity11 , their leaders say			1
5 predictions for @entity4 vs. @entity3 more than 500 years after @entity16 ' encounter with the natives of the @entity18 , any enduring uneasiness between @entity11 and mainstream society is exemplified by the controversy over the @entity4 name , which took a new turn last week when president @entity24 spoke of " legitimate concerns " that the mascot is racist , some @entity14 leaders say			1
@entity28 mascots : pride or prejudice ? team owners strongly dispute any racism behind the mascot and wo n't change it , saying the @entity4 name honors " where we came from , who we are			1
" but many @entity14 contend it 's incredulous that a major sports team in the nation 's capital fails to see the word 's offensiveness , especially in a game sunday whose rival mascots conjure up the bygone real bloodshed between cowboys and @entity11			1
some news outlets and sports writers agree and are n't printing " redskin " in their stories about the @entity2 team			2
" after 500 years , it 's pretty unbelievable that this issue is at the forefront right now , " said @entity52 , a @entity53 who 's an assistant professor and director of the @entity56 at the @entity57			2
" even in the last 50 years ( of the civil rights movement ) , we learned so much			0
it 's just ridiculous that this is an issue			2
" the @entity2 team disagrees			2
in response , the @entity65 of @entity66 began airing this weekend a radio ad protesting the @entity4 mascot in the @entity3 ' hometown			1
the ad , entitled " @entity72 , " quotes how @entity24 , a @entity73 , and rep. @entity74 , a @entity75 leader in the @entity76 , disapprove of the @entity4 name			1
@entity79 team owner @entity78 stepped up his defense of the moniker this month			1
last spring , he told @entity82 he will " never " change the name			0
" our fans sing ' @entity86 ' in celebration at every @entity4 game			1
they speak proudly of ' @entity91 ' in honor of a sports team they love , " @entity78 wrote in a letter to fans			2
" after 81 years , the team name ' @entity4 ' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from , who we are , and who we want to be in the years to come , " he continued			1
" i respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name			2
but i hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means , not only for all of us in the extended @entity4 family , but among @entity14 too , " @entity78 said , citing several polls conducted in recent years that show that a majority of people do not want the name changed			1
but @entity114 @entity11 like @entity52 worry about the normalization of an epithet			1
he 's also vice president of the @entity117 , which launched last month a media resource page on its website about offensive @entity28 mascots in @entity114 sports			1
" we 're on the verge of laying back and letting this name run rampant when we can actually make a difference , which is what we all should be striving for , " @entity52 said			0
" i 'm glad to see there are so many organizations like @entity117 and the ( @entity114 ) president who are standing against it			1
" @entity24 said last week that if he were the team 's owner , he would " think about changing it , " referring to the mascot			1
opinion : @entity24 is right about ' @entity4 ' @entity24 added that " i do n't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real , legitimate concerns that people have about these things			1
" the ad also airs a quote by @entity74 saying " the name is just simply inappropriate			0
it is offensive to a lot of people			0
" @entity4 , @entity24 & a name - changing public relations disaster the political leaders ' remarks are repeated in the radio ad advanced by the @entity65 and its leader @entity151 , who 's also ceo of @entity153 , which operates a casino and other businesses			1
@entity151 acknowledged his tribe 's " @entity158 " campaign faces an uphill struggle			2
he refers to the mascot as " the @entity161 , " without explicitly stating it			1
" well , history is littered with people who have vowed never to change something -- slavery , immigration , women 's rights -- so we think one thing that 's really great about this country is when many people speak out , change can happen , " @entity151 said			2
when asked about other team mascots such as the @entity175 , @entity11 , @entity176 and @entity177 , @entity151 cited how " redskin " is defined in the @entity179 unabridged online dictionary as " usually offensive			2
" " let 's be clear			2
the name , the @entity184 word , is defined in the dictionary as an offensive term			0
it 's a racial epithet			0
it 's a racial slur			0
i think there is a broader discussion to be had about using mascots generally and the damage it does to people and their self - identity			0
but certainly there 's no gray area on this issue , " he said			0
@entity151 asserted the word was born out of hatred -- and referred to the long , ugly history between the native people of the @entity18 and the colonizers from @entity205 who followed @entity206			0
" its origin is hated , use is hated , it was the name our people -- that was used against our people when we were forced off our lands at gunpoint			0
it was a name that was used when our children were forced out of our homes and into boarding schools , " he said			0
" so , it has a sordid history			0
and it 's time for a change , and we hope that -- and what 's great is when enough people do recognize that , change will come			0
" fans are sharply divided about the issue			0
a non-scientific online poll by the @entity231 shows 43 % saying the team should change its name			0
but 57 % say no , keep it			0
one respondent said the term is " a racist holdover from another day , a time when @entity11 were depicted as violent , ignorant , savages ( by ) whites ( who largely were equally violent , ignorant and savage )			0
" but another respondent referred to political correctness and said : " the liberal pc society has gotten out of control , if you do n't like the teams name then do n't watch them ... ! " @entity4 attorney @entity248 said the mascot is " not about race , not about disrespect			1
" at games , he joins fans in singing " @entity86 " because " it 's a song of honor , it 's a song of tribute			0

the controversy over @entity4 mascot heightens as team plays the @entity3 this weekend
it just so happens it 's @entity8 weekend , adding historical context
the @entity65 is airing radio ads saying the " @entity161 " is racist
but the team owner says the @entity4 name honors @entity114 *heritage*
