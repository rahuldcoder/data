-- as @entity3 fans and the media pour into @entity5 , @entity6 , for what could be the most widely watched memorial of all time , an obvious question remains : where will he be laid to rest ? @entity12 is among the notables buried at the @entity15 park			1
although the jackson family has n't made an official statement , all signs seem to point toward @entity19 , the organization that has buried a vast number of @entity15 's notables			1
on monday , sources told @entity0 that @entity3 's relatives will hold a private gathering at the @entity26 in @entity5 tuesday morning ahead of a massive public service			1
the gathering is scheduled for 8 a.m. ( 11 a.m. et ) -- two hours before a memorial service at the @entity31 arena downtown			0
cemetery officials have not commented on the matter			0
sunday , @entity34 , assistant chief of staff of the @entity36 on sunday , said @entity15 officials were working with the @entity17 on their plans , which were part of " a package " of events tuesday			1
his comments , however , did not answer questions about where or when @entity3 would be buried			1
there is speculation that the burial will be at @entity50 's @entity49 location , but the media have been swarming around the @entity53 memorial park , located right off the freeway behind @entity55			1
@entity57 's ex-wife , @entity56 , is believed to be buried there			1
@entity59 is the first stop tourists make in search of the crypts of @entity15 greats			1
numerous books and web sites such as findagrave.com and seeing - stars.com claim to have insider knowledge about celebrity grave locations on the properties , but @entity15 is unrelentingly secretive about who , exactly , is entombed in its parks			1
" we hold the privacy of our client families in very high regard , " said @entity73 , spokesman for the @entity49 location , which is considered the " mother lode " for celebrity grave hunters			1
" there are certain areas and property types that have limited access			0
" the tombs of @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 are in locked areas not accessible to the general public , according to findagrave.com			1
with that kind of commitment to privacy , it 's understandable why @entity3 , known for being reclusive , might be buried there			1
@entity98 grave hunter @entity97 , who frequents both the @entity49 and @entity53 parks , said she would n't be surprised if @entity3 were to be buried at either location			1
@entity97 was first drawn to @entity49 because of its artwork and statuary , but once she found out that celebrities were " buried with the regular people , " she said , she began to grave hunt			2
" we leave flowers and take pictures , " @entity97 said of her time at famous graves			0
" it 's the way of remembering someone who made a difference , who cheered me up when i was a kid or entertained me			2
with @entity3 ... if he ends up at a cemetery , i 'll definitely go and take flowers			2
they feel like a member of the family , so you treat them like a member of the family			0
" even if you ca n't find a way to see your favorite celebrity 's crypt , @entity5 residents said that just stepping foot in the park is an experience in itself			0
" i know for some people cemeteries can be intimidating or just where you go to mourn			0
but at @entity15 , it is n't sad ; it 's really a beautiful place , " said @entity138 , an @entity139 , @entity6 , professional who frequents the park 's museum			1
but if you call any of the @entity49 and @entity145 a cemetery , you would be remiss			0
there are certainly graves behind the @entity49 park 's majestic wrought - iron gates , but that 's where the similarities end			2
amid its 300 acres , the park has three churches , replicas of all of @entity156 's works and a copy of @entity159 's " @entity158 " in stained glass			0
instead of above - ground tombstones , the park uses flat , engraved markers for grave sites , so from afar all you can see are grassy hills			0
the memorial park draws over a million visitors each year , including 70,000 who come to get married			0
built in 1906 as a traditional cemetery , @entity15 was revamped by dr. @entity170 in 1917			2
like @entity3 , @entity170 was " an icon [ of his ] time , " said @entity173 , author of " 100 years in the @entity174			2
" " [ @entity170 ] is the man who first envisioned the memorial park concept , that cemeteries should not be filled with tombstones but should celebrate the life of those entombed there and celebrate the living , " @entity173 said , " and people loved the whole concept			0
" @entity97 agrees whole - heartedly with @entity170 's vision			2
" cemeteries are for the living , " @entity97 said about her visits to celebrity tombs			0
" we 're remembering them			0
it sounds crazy , but i dare anyone to do it , and i 'd bet it would make them feel good			0

will @entity3 be buried among other stars at a @entity15 location ?
the not - for - profit group 's *strict* regulations about privacy would match @entity3 's life
