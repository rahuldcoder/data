-- by the time we arrive at @entity2 , on the northwestern shore of @entity5 's @entity4 , we 've seen far more birds than people			1
@entity10 grebes , thousands of them , bob peacefully until our boat gets directly in front of them			1
then they dive upside down like toy ducks , showing their black - and - white behinds before disappearing under the surface			2
@entity5 , @entity18 , is a haven for water recreation			1
so when we pull up to @entity20 , we 're almost surprised to see a couple of bass fishermen casting right off the dock			2
people at last ! " catch anything ? " my husband calls out			2
" nah , " says one , without looking up			2
his friend chimes in , " but at least it 's a nice place to hang out			2
" and then , gesturing to @entity20 : " and the wine over there 's pretty good too			1
" the scene sums up what 's so nice about visiting @entity18 's @entity5			1
even with a burgeoning wine scene , @entity5 is still first and foremost a haven of water recreation and summertime fun			1
if you 're looking for the opposite of tony @entity41 , it does n't get much more un-napa than this			2
the fun center of the wine country two - and - a - half hours north of @entity46 and two hours northwest of @entity47 , @entity4 has long been party central for college kids drawn here for water - skiing , boating and concerts at @entity54			1
though that element certainly still exists , now there are also a few very sophisticated restaurants and hotels ( the @entity58 and the @entity59 , most notably ) , as well as 10 or so worthwhile wineries			2
among those is the only boat - in winery we 've ever heard of			1
( @entity65 , restaurants , wineries ) it 's a concept we ca n't resist			2
@entity70 , of @entity72 's @entity71 , sets us up at the boat launch in @entity74 , instructing us to head east first to " the @entity75 , " where the north arm of the lake connects to the south arm , before the lake gets choppy			1
he tells us how to use @entity80			0
@entity81 -- the once - active volcano that looms several thousand feet above the lake -- as a landmark , and invites us to call his cell phone if we lose our bearings			0
though it 's still morning , we 're dying to check out @entity20 -- we 'll have just a sip , we rationalize			0
we head north toward the lake 's western shore , passing @entity90			0
we briefly consider stopping here for a hike ( the park has boat access as well ) , but decide against it , figuring that today should be all about boat rides and decadence			1
a few miles northwest of the park , we glimpse the dock of @entity20 , looking like an arm outstretched in a gesture of welcome			0
after we 've chatted with the fishermen , we tie up the boat and walk up the dock into a @entity107 - style garden that could easily be mistaken for one beside @entity109 's @entity108			1
a lavender - lined path leads through gardens framed by olive trees			0
in front of us is a courtyard where a fountain burbles and festive music plays			0
people come and go in and out of a tasting room tucked into a series of hacienda - style buildings			0
the place feels more like a spa than a winery -- and in fact , it will eventually be both , @entity125 tells us			0
@entity125 , whose family produced an annual 2.5 million cases of wines in the 1980s and ' 90s , discovered @entity5 as a teenager , when his father used to take him on grape - buying trips			1
after the @entity125 family sold the company and the name , @entity125 bought a 163 - acre piece of prime lakefront property in the then not - so - nice town of @entity138 ( pronounced like the city in @entity140 ) and set about creating the county 's first resortlike destination			0
he plans to break ground on the spa as well as a restaurant in two to three years			0
" @entity5 could be the fun center of the wine country , " @entity125 says , gesturing out to the lake , where a seaplane is floating , flanked by a group of teenagers sunning themselves on inner tubes			1
after calling out a welcome to the group -- which , it turns out , is celebrating a birthday out here on the lake -- @entity125 tells us about the seaplane access he 's just created , and the ferry system he 's working on putting in place			0
he talks about @entity5 's clean air ( the best in the state , he claims ) , the lack of fog , the tremendous birdlife			1
" being on the lake , making wine , it does n't get much better , " he says			1
on the way back to @entity74 , at @entity125 's urging , we stop at @entity172 , a wetlands preserve just a few miles west of @entity20			0
we kill the engine , and slowly , an @entity176 scene comes to life before our eyes : a great blue heron stands stately in the tule reeds ; a grebe dives for its prey			1
i say that i ca n't believe all the birdlife here			0
" why not ? " my husband replies			0
" it 's a pretty nice place to hang out			0
