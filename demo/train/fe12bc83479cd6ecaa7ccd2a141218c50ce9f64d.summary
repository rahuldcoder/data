-- in 2000 , only 11.7 percent of @entity2 's board members were women			1
today , that figure is still disappointingly low at just 16.9 percent			1
@entity5 , a former investment banker turned headhunter , thinks she might know why this is			2
as managing director and principal shareholder of the executive search company @entity11 , she recently wrote " mrs @entity13 's @entity12			2
" speaking at this year 's @entity15 conference , an event where @entity17 was a media partner , @entity5 explains that the sooner women accept that they ca n't have it all , the better			1
" the biggest challenge to women in the workplace that still has n't changed is the level of unconscious bias			0
so people have in their minds that they would prefer not to hire or promote a woman and they do n't even realize that they feel like that			0
i know as a headhunter that if i propose two candidates of equal skills , maybe they 're both in their mid thirties , one 's a man and one 's a woman , and the woman has recently gotten married , assuming there 's nothing else to choose between them , the employer will choose the man and that 's even if the employer is a woman			1
" " the best careers advice i 've ever received myself , which was so good that i wrote a whole book based on it , is that the way we can smash the myth of the glass ceiling is to smash the myth that women can have it all			0
to really pursue a career is no different to pursuing your gold medal in the @entity57			0
you have to make choices and they 're not always easy			0
in my experience , if you try and do everything well what will end up happening is you will end up disappointing everyone			0
much better to disappoint a very small number of people and everybody else is not disappointed , and furthermore supportive of you and your career			0
" " people still think that women are not going to be as reliable a hire as a man , especially in those mid years			2
it 's a sad truth today , and i hope this will change , that women have to not just be as good as a man , but better			1
because if you 're faced with two people and one of them is a 35 - year old woman with a wedding ring , and she 's noticeably better than the man , you 'll still hire the 35 - year - old woman with a wedding ring			1

only 16.9 percent of @entity2 's board members are women
@entity5 explains that a man will get hired over a *suitable* women if she recently married
women have to be noticeably better than men to get *ahead*
