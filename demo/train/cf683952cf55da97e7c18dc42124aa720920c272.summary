@entity0 -- @entity2 now has the toughest immigration law in the nation			1
the law went into effect on september 29 , prompting hundreds of families to pull their children from school and workers to disappear from @entity2 farms			2
a federal appeals court has blocked some provisions , including the one requiring state officials to check the legal status of students in public schools			0
no doubt , the issue is far from being settled			2
@entity2 is just one state where an uproar over immigration has been heard			1
the rapid growth in @entity2 's immigrant population , a large proportion estimated to be mostly present illegally , was the impetus behind the law			1
but the reality of immigration is more complex than the perception			2
you would n't know it from the rhetoric the last few years , but immigration nationally over the past decade was slower than in the 1990s			1
between 1990 and 2000 , the @entity32 gained 11.3 million immigrants , the largest increase this country has ever experienced , a growth rate of 57 %			2
the 2000s , by contrast , witnessed an 8.8 million increase in immigrants , a 28 % growth rate			2
an estimated 40 million foreign - born individuals now call the @entity32 home , according to @entity45 data released in september , which we analyze in a new report			0
so why the ruckus now ? the context for immigration has changed considerably since 2000			2
economic times were good at the beginning of the decade , so immigrants , legal and illegal , were drawn by plentiful jobs in an expanding economy			1
back then , they were viewed as assets to our labor force and society			0
today , amid economic distress , unemployment and shrinking public coffers , immigrants are more likely to be viewed as a drain on resources and as competitors for jobs			2
during the economic expansion of the late 1990s , immigrants found new opportunities in some unexpected places			1
this trend continued in this decade as immigrants dispersed to new metro areas and suburbs within metro areas			1
the five metropolitan areas with the largest foreign - born populations -- @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 -- housed a smaller share of the nation 's immigrants , just 38 % in 2010 , compared to 43 % in 2000			1
meanwhile , immigrants have increasingly settled in the suburbs , so by 2010 a majority of the nation 's immigrants are suburban residents			2
nine metropolitan areasâ € ” from @entity93 , @entity94 to @entity95 , @entity96 to @entity97 , @entity98 € ” experienced at least a doubling of their foreign - born populations between 2000 and 2010			0
this rapid change did not come without resistance			0
in the eight states represented by these metro areas , restrictive immigration legislation was introduced , if not passed			1
@entity106 , @entity107 , and @entity2 all participate in the 287 ( g ) program , an agreement between state and local law enforcement with @entity112 ( @entity112 ) delegating authority for immigration enforcement within their jurisdictions			1
the friction in places unaccustomed to or unprepared for new inflows of foreigners , particularly those who are assumed to be present illegally , manifests itself in different ways			0
in @entity130 , @entity2 , @entity123 , @entity96 and @entity124 , where metro areas experienced some of the fastest or largest growth in their foreign - born populations over the decade , state legislatures passed laws in 2011 to crack down on unauthorized residents			1
not every region is reacting in this way			0
metro areas that want to stem their population loss and boost economic growth -- such as @entity139 and @entity140 -- are devising ways to woo immigrants			1
these areas experienced the slowest growth of their immigrant populations among all metropolitan areas -- @entity139 at 9 % and @entity140 at 6 % -- well below the 26 % growth across the 100 largest metro areas			1
@entity150 , @entity149 , where the tiny immigrant population grew by 57 % over the past 10 years , is the most recent place to buck the " stay out " trend			1
the city council agreed to a new plan , crafted by 130 community members from all segments of @entity150 's communities , outlining a framework for new policies to make the city more open and supportive of immigrants			0
@entity150 's mayor @entity163 emphasized , " this is not a city of @entity150 government program			0
for this effort to be successful , it will take the support and active participation of businesses , schools , institutions and organizations throughout the @entity150 area			0
the welcome @entity150 plan represents an attitude we all must adopt to take advantage of the brainpower , energy and resources available through the various immigrant groups coming to @entity150			0
" even as @entity2 state legislators were passing their restrictive legislation , city council members in @entity184 voted unanimously on a resolution condemning the law when it was passed in june , calling for a commission to figure out better ways to address the issues			0
there is widespread agreement that the national immigration system is broken , but no consensus on how to fix it			0
given an acrimonious @entity198 , the emotional nature of the immigration issue -- especially in tough economic times -- and the looming presidential campaign season , federal reform is an unlikely prospect in the near future			1
in the meantime , a patchwork of state and local approaches will continue to address the benefits and challenges of immigration that confront people where they live , where they govern , and where budgets are made			0
in other words , do n't expect the uproar to die down anytime soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity112 actually slowed down in the last decade despite the uproar , authors say
they say the immigration issue is much more *contentious* because of a poor economy
some areas have seen immigrant population more than double , prompting *controversy*
authors : while some pass laws to curb immigrants , other places welcome them
