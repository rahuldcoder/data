to @entity13 eyes more used to the region portrayed through images of religion , conflict or conservative societies , it may come as a surprise to learn these photographs represent a snapshot of life in the @entity23			1
but these and 300,000 more gathered in an archive in @entity25 tell a different story : one of a long - forgotten belle epoque of glamour and innocence			1
this sprawling photographic collection is the work of the @entity32 , a non-profit organization dedicated safeguarding a local perspective often overshadowed by the works of @entity13 photographers			1
" we were interested in showing the @entity32 world as we know it ; as we see it in our photographic album , " foundation director @entity36 told @entity0			1
this lovingly - curated collection boasts many gems , not least the noir - ish work of @entity44 , an @entity46 - @entity45 portrait photographer who attracted the rich and famous to his @entity49 studio			0
active during the 1940s and 50s , @entity44 also pursued his own artistic vision , posing for fantasy self - portraits , re-imagining himself as a heroic pilot , prisoner -- or even a chiffon - robed young woman			0
says @entity36 , @entity44 , whose work predates similar projects by celebrated @entity59 photographer @entity58 by almost 40 years , is among several " enthusiastic " supporters of the 13 - year - old foundation			1
but , with most of its funding coming from @entity64 and the @entity59 , she says more @entity23 donors , who tend to back charitable rather than cultural organizations , need to step up to help preserve their own past			1
the foundation 's new research center in @entity25 , where white - gloved curators carefully handle the slides , plates , prints and negatives that make up the collection , should help , she says			0
it is hoped the research will offer new insight , not only into a golden era for the region , but also into the techniques of those who strove to capture it			0
adds @entity36 : " we do have important historical documents , but the main interest in these images were what the images can tell us about the relationship between the photographer and his clients			2
" @entity0 's @entity93 contributed to this story			0

@entity32 has collected more than 300,000 photographs
aim is to preserve archive of images of @entity23 by local photographers
@entity32 funded mainly from @entity59 and @entity64 but is seeking regional backers
