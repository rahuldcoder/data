-- from luxury hotels in colossal tower blocks to traditional " ryokan " and functional capsule hotels , there 's plenty of variety in @entity9 's hotel scene			1
sample the salaryman lifestyle at the @entity11			0
if you can afford it -- and you probably ca n't -- you owe it to yourself to stay at the @entity15 ( 1 - 8 - 1 @entity16 , @entity17 )			1
as well as overlooking the @entity19 , what makes this hotel so special is the incredible array of high - tech mod cons in the rooms			1
there are wall panels that show the outdoor weather conditions , in - room nail dryers and espresso machines and , best of all , the toilets have a heated , self - lifting seat and built - in power deodorizer -- ingenious			1
another top - end option is the @entity34 ( 3 - 7 - 1 - 2 @entity35 ) , immediately recognizable as the setting for the movie " @entity38			1
" the hotel occupies floors 41 to 52 of the @entity41 , and with breathtaking views over the city and towards @entity46 , its popularity with visiting celebrities is understandable			2
a more economical option is the @entity9 ( @entity48 , 1 - 7 - 1 , @entity49 ) , which also has great views , along with modern , unfussy rooms			1
the hotel even employs " @entity54 " staff to make sure you get a good night 's sleep			2
@entity57 ( 1 - 6 - 30 @entity58 , @entity17 ) has comfortable rooms and is surprisingly luxurious for a business hotel			1
a " ryokan " is a traditional @entity62 - style inn , often featuring communal baths and rooms with futons and " tatami " ( straw mat ) flooring			1
they also tend to be cheaper than regular hotels			0
family - run @entity72 ( 2 - 3 - 11 @entity74 , @entity75 ) is cheap and homely			0
the @entity77 - speaking owner is exceptionally helpful and keen to immerse you in @entity62 culture			0
if you 're lucky , his family will put on a tea ceremony or lion dance for your viewing pleasure			0
@entity84 ( 1 - 31 - 11 @entity85 , @entity75 ) is a more expensive but more traditional option			2
most rooms have private bathrooms but it 's worth using the communal baths just for the views of the nearby five - storied pagoda			1
' @entity94 - style ' rooms are also available			0
if you 're on a tight budget , or just curious , you could always try a ' capsule ' hotel , where guests sleep in coffin - sized capsules , just big enough to sit up in			1
aimed primarily at workers too tired or too drunk to make it home , capsule hotels are only really suitable for single - night stays			2
@entity103 ( 2 - 20 - 4 @entity104 , @entity75 ) , with a women - only floor , is one of the few capsule hotels in @entity9 that allows female guests			2
you 'll be provided with a dressing gown and toothbrush and you 'll have access to communal bathing facilities			0
be sure to take earplugs , as the snores of drunken salarymen wo n't do much for your beauty sleep			0
where to stay what to see where to be seen where to eat where to shop ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
do you agree with our @entity9 picks ? send us your comments and suggestions in the " @entity129 " box below and we 'll print the best .			0

why stay at the @entity15 ? because it has in - room espresso machines
the views from the @entity34 were the real star of " @entity38 "
a " ryokan " is a traditional inn , with futons and " tatami " floor mats in the rooms
if you 're short on cash , or just curious , spend a night in a capsule hotel
