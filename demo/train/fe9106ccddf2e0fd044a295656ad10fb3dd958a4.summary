-- " @entity1 " weaves together a rich , deep storyline with its " shoot everything " mentality to produce an adventure that will immerse you for many , many hours			1
the game opens back on @entity8 , a planet with a @entity11 mentality and penchant for outlaw justice			1
it begins five years after the ending of " @entity8 " and the opening of the vault , a location of rumored riches that actually contained a huge alien beast with massive jaws and multiple tentacles			1
this time , @entity8 is under the control of a man named @entity25 , who is mining the planet for a valuable resource in order to open yet another vault			1
it 's not hard to figure out @entity25 is the villain -- you begin the game left for dead after being attacked by his henchmen			1
one of the main things " @entity8 " may have lacked , " @entity1 " has in spades -- a great narrative with interesting characters			1
the writing team at @entity39 really delved deep into each character , making them unique and giving them purpose			1
players can connect with them and that sense of immersion raises the level of " @entity1 " from just a simple shooter to something more			1
dialog from the characters helps cement that attachment , as well as providing some comedic moments			1
some of the death screams of enemies are almost " @entity62 " and the humor helps take the edge off all the dying and suffering that goes on around you			1
banter between characters is laugh - out - loud funny			1
serious soldiers have lighthearted moments and comedic foils are portrayed in serious moments			1
the range is what you 'd expect from real people , not typical one - dimensional game characters			1
even @entity25 , bad guy though he may be , evolves and changes throughout the game			1
starting out as a sarcastic , taunting , self - centered jerk , he changes and starts to exhibit other , more caring emotions			2
but as with most people , you find out what he 's really all about in the end			2
you really are going to hate this guy			2
the story progresses through a mission / quest based system			1
there is the main quest ( beat @entity25 , save the day ) , but there are numerous side missions that help raise your experience while helping you understand what 's going on with @entity8			2
interaction with other characters is a must			2
take your time through the missions			0
see everything there is to see			0
talk to anyone you can			0
it makes the game more enjoyable and you 'll discover even more missions			2
finishing the game will take hours , so there 's no rush to get to the story 's climax			1
" @entity1 , " like its predecessor , is all about the loot -- specifically weapons			1
there are hundreds of different weapon configurations to be found or bought			2
do you keep a pistol because it does acid damage or opt for the shotgun with more power ? the choices can be exhausting , but can really be tailored to fit your style of play			2
there are boxes containing loot at nearly every turn			0
unless you are in open terrain , it 's hard not to find one of these boxes around			0
players will get overwhelmed by the amount of treasure they find and will , at times , have to leave some behind because they ca n't carry it all			0
you 'll sell off a lot , but end up spending that money on more ammo or better shields			0
and nearly every enemy you kill will drop something			0
makes you wonder where that spider - ant is hiding that sniper rifle , but hey , he obviously does n't need it anymore			0
oh , and outhouses scattered throughout @entity8 are real treasure chests			0
i guess people did n't notice they were dropping their weapons as they were taking care of business			0
the customization extends from the armory into the player characters themselves			2
there are four characters to choose from			2
more of an assassin ? zero is your guy			0
@entity161 is a commando soldier while @entity162 is a " gunzerker " ( think crazy guy with two guns )			0
@entity166 is a @entity167 , with telepathic / mystical powers			0
each playthrough will be unique depending on which skills you choose			0
characters can also be visually customized			2
change your character 's head or clothes and you can still stand out in a crowd of @entity179			1
graphically , the game looks and plays like " @entity8			1
" controls are basically the same with only a few changes			0
environments are noticeably different , though , looking sharper and more vibrant than before			0
there are also barrels full of acid , electricity , explosives and the like on battlefields , so make use of them to take care of large groups of enemies			0
for a game as large and deep as " @entity1 , " there were only a few visual glitches			1
( helicopter pilots would remain in mid-air after their choppers were blown to bits			0
creatures would get blown into solid rock faces from grenades , not allowing them to be killed but still allowing them to fire at you			0
) want to up the challenge ? add up to three friends and the enemies ( and loot ) ramp up appropriately			0
choose between up to four - player online co-op or ( if you want to have your partner next to you ) two - player split screen co- op. the game will also support two split - screen co-ops if that 's how you want to roll			2
it really works best when four people play different classes because each complements the other with their particular skills			0
having four assassins would be a bit silly			0
" @entity1 " took what was fun from " @entity8 " and added interesting characters with a range of emotions , and a deep , telling storyline worth following			1
you 'll laugh , you 'll get angry and you are likely to grip your controller a bit tighter as the tension mounts			0
all those accolades " @entity1 " has received are deserved and well - earned			1
if you liked " @entity8 , " you are going to love " @entity1			1
" " @entity1 " is available now for pcs , @entity234 and @entity235 .			1

' @entity1 ' improves on original with better story , characters
@entity240 picks up five years after original on a @entity11 planet
choices of character , weapon can change how game plays
moments of humor *soften* the *carnage*
