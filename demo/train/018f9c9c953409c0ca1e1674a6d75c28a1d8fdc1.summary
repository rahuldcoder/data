-- president @entity2 's remarks monday on @entity3 were in some ways the most significant of his presidency			1
they were , at their core , about the role of government -- all governments -- and the responsibility of citizens to take care of themselves and each other when times are tough			1
by embracing self - reliance and resiliency -- " take care of yourselves " and " we will get through this " were themes -- @entity2 did more to defend and explain the role of government than any presidential debate ever could			1
the message was political , but not in the partisan sense			0
it was more akin to the debates at @entity30 's founding on the role of government , and included an appropriate sense of tough love			1
it was a statement to the nation that reality is sometimes cruel and challenging			0
it was not filled with a " we got this " bravado			0
it would have been a lie for @entity2 to say so ; as he noted , this is a massive storm , and -- by meteorologists ' accounts -- of a different nature from what responders have seen before			1
he did not promise instantaneous response , explaining that first responders and utility company workers should not put themselves at risk until conditions are safer			0
nor did he claim that all would be back to normal immediately			0
politics : looking presidential -- the optics of leadership during a disaster that messaging was not an accident , nor was it partisan			0
in the statements from the @entity63 to statehouses both @entity65 and @entity66 , there 's a hint that @entity3 may help engender a new discussion about our resiliency			0
the measure of our success has as much to do with our initial response to a crisis as it does with restoring the mechanisms that support our commerce and transportation and all other aspects of our infrastructure			1
the value of a stronger infrastructure is not just that it does n't fall apart when the winds howl , but that if operations are interrupted , it gets running again as soon as possible			1
it is not too early to think about @entity3 as a key point in policy discussions about our aging infrastructure and our lack of commitment to it			1
for the last several years , infrastructure enhancements have often been tied to the economic debate			1
the stimulus package had a dual purpose : get roads fixed , bridges modernized , transportation systems upgraded , and all while putting people back to work			2
it was an important effort , but its public message referred primarily to jobs and the economy , not public safety			0
that we have to hunker down for the next few days is a basic -- and correct -- safety response to the wrath of such a storm			0
but @entity2 also noted an obvious fact : our ability to bounce back -- to get the power lines restored , the transportation systems running -- is no small feat. when a storm puts 60 million people in danger , sends tens of thousands across the eastern seaboard fleeing to the high ground to escape a surge made more threatening by a century of rising sea level ; when it essentially shuts down @entity125 , bringing the transportation system to a halt and even shutting down the stock exchange -- it is not just a matter of safety in this storm			1
when we talk about upgrading and improving our infrastructure , we are talking about maintaining our resiliency as nature serves up ever more complicated , unpredictable weather in our new era of climate change			2
politics : 5 things to watch in hurricane - wracked campaign how to do this ? there are plenty of solutions , many with bipartisan support			2
one involves creating an infrastructure bank , where the private sector directly invests in infrastructure projects , as is the case in many countries , with the promise that toll fees will bring in the financial gains			1
architects embrace a concept of resilient design : for example , a new bridge across @entity158 will sway with an earthquake rather than resist it			0
public policy planners from @entity125 to @entity163 are grappling with how to make investments and drive activity , even as big weather puts much of the last century 's infrastructure at risk , and sometimes under water			2
electric companies that have fought government requirements to submerge power lines will face criticism about why so many lines are vulnerable			1
if storms like @entity3 are likely in the future , we will begin to see a move toward a more resilient infrastructure , starting with projects that are already under way			2
local and state governments are likely to require that primary power cables are underground and protected			2
design competitions are just beginning to make resiliency a priority for public projects			0
anticipate much more of this in the future ; and , after the election , expect the infrastructure bank idea to gain momentum as legislators recognize that it might be better for the private sector to pay for projects that benefit their communities			1
shutting down , as we all are doing this week , makes sense			0
but afterward , the real focus has to be on getting better at starting back up			0
no nation is immune to harm , but prepared nations are quicker at getting back to normal			0
@entity3 has caused a lot of damage and suffering , but there are many emergency managers , architects , city planners and politicians who hope that it may also refocus a political effort to invest and upgrade			2
it is good for the economy , yes , but more important , it is good for our safety			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 : @entity2 pointed out roles of self - reliance and government in crisis
@entity226 : success in dealing with emergency is measured in what we do after
we need to improve our ability to get the power restored , transportation running , she says
@entity226 : we need commitment from private sector , creative efforts to improve infrastructure
