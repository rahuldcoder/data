@entity0 -- a top official in the @entity5 administration 's @entity3 told a @entity7 panel tuesday that he made a mistake in failing to warn attorney general @entity9 and other justice executives about the controversial @entity13 tactic of allowing illegally purchased guns to " walk " across the border , into the hands of @entity18 drug cartels			1
at a @entity21 subcommittee hearing , assistant attorney general @entity19 was grilled by sen. @entity22 , @entity23			1
@entity19 acknowledged that in hindsight , he would have done things differently			2
@entity19 's apologetic tone followed months of top @entity3 officials staunchly defending what they said was their minimal role in flawed operations by the @entity13 and denials of high - level involvement			2
@entity19 said he learned of the tactic of allowing illegally purchased guns to leave gun shops in april 2010 regarding a previous operation known as @entity37			1
" i wish that at that time that i had said clearly to the deputy attorney general and the attorney general that in this case , @entity37 , we had determined in 2006 and 2007 guns had ' walked			1
' i did not do that , and i regret not doing that , " @entity19 admitted			2
@entity19 had expressed his regret over his action in a statement late monday			2
@entity49 began in 2006 during the @entity51 administration			0
the controversial @entity49 began in 2009 during the @entity5 administration and allowed illegally purchased firearms to " walk " from gun stores in @entity55 across the border to drug cartels with the intent of monitoring the flow of weapons , but hundreds were lost or unaccounted for			1
the tactic led to a storm of outrage inside and outside the @entity13 when two of the missing weapons were found at the site where @entity68 agent @entity68 was killed in december			0
@entity19 also admitted to @entity22 he had failed to recognize that the same tactics used four years earlier were used again in @entity49			1
" i did not draw a connection between the unacceptable tactics used by the @entity13 years earlier in @entity49 and those in @entity49 and therefore did not alert others within @entity3 leadership of any similarities between the two			1
that was a mistake , and i regret not having done so , " @entity19 said			0
as head of the criminal division , @entity19 is one of @entity9 's most important assistants			0
@entity19 's statement of regret came as the @entity3 sent 650 pages of documents to congressional investigators			0
the documents had been subpoenaed october 11 by @entity87 lawmakers angered by what they claim was stonewalling by the justice officials			0
@entity22 said at the hearing that the @entity3 officially assured him in february that allegations of gun walking in @entity49 were not true			1
" however , as mr. @entity19 's admissions in yesterday 's statement made clear , the @entity3 's claim was not true , " @entity22 said			0
" with every document that comes out , the @entity3 loses credibility and the faith of the @entity101 people , " @entity22 concluded .			0
