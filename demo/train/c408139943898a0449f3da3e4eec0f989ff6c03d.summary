-- @entity2 dr. @entity1 was on call one night four decades ago when a devastated rape victim walked in			2
her eyes were lifeless ; she was like a breathing corpse			2
" she looked at me and said , ' if only i had teeth down there , ' " recalled @entity1 , who was a 20 - year - old medical researcher at the time			1
" i promised her i 'd do something to help people like her one day			2
" forty years later , @entity15 was born			0
@entity1 is distributing the female condoms in the various @entity2 cities where the @entity19 soccer games are taking place			1
the woman inserts the latex condom like a tampon			1
@entity25 rows of teeth - like hooks line its inside and attach on a man 's penis during penetration , @entity1 said			1
once it lodges , only a doctor can remove it -- a procedure @entity1 hopes will be done with authorities on standby to make an arrest			1
" it hurts , he can not pee and walk when it 's on , " she said			1
" if he tries to remove it , it will clasp even tighter ... however , it does n't break the skin , and there 's no danger of fluid exposure			1
" @entity1 said she sold her house and car to launch the project , and she planned to distribute 30,000 free devices under supervision during the @entity19 period			1
" i consulted engineers , gynecologists and psychologists to help in the design and make sure it was safe , " she said			0
after the trial period , they 'll be available for about $ 2 a piece			0
she hopes the women will report back to her			0
" the ideal situation would be for a woman to wear this when she 's going out on some kind of blind date ... or to an area she 's not comfortable with , " she said			1
the mother of two daughters said she visited prisons and talked to convicted rapists to find out whether such a device would have made them rethink their actions			1
some said it would have , @entity1 said			0
critics say the female condom is not a long - term solution and makes women vulnerable to more violence from men trapped by the device			1
it 's also a form of " enslavement , " said @entity86 , a fellow for the @entity87 in the east @entity2 country of @entity89			1
" the fears surrounding the victim , the act of wearing the condom in anticipation of being assaulted all represent enslavement that no woman should be subjected to			1
" @entity86 said the device constantly reminds women of their vulnerability			2
" it not only presents the victim with a false sense of security , but psychological trauma , " she added			0
" it also does not help with the psychological problems that manifest after assaults			0
" however , its one advantage is it allows justice to be served , she said			0
various rights organizations that work in @entity2 declined to comment , including @entity113 and @entity114			0
@entity2 has one of the highest rape rates in the world , @entity113 says on its website			0
a 2009 report by the nation 's @entity120 found that 28 percent of men surveyed had raped a woman or girl , with one in 20 saying they had raped in the past year , according to @entity113			2
in most @entity2 countries , rape convictions are not common			0
affected women do n't get immediate access to medical care , and dna tests to provide evidence are unaffordable			0
" women and girls who experience these violations are denied justice , factors that contribute to the normalization of rape and violence in @entity2 society , " @entity113 says			0
women take drastic measures to prevent rape in @entity2 , @entity1 said , with some wearing extra tight biker shorts and others inserting razor blades wrapped in sponges in their private parts			0
critics have accused her of developing a medieval device to fight rape			2
" yes , my device may be a medieval , but it 's for a medieval deed that has been around for decades , " she said			1
" i believe something 's got to be done ... and this will make some men rethink before they assault a woman			2
