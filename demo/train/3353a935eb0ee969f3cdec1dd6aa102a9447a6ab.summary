reporter @entity0 walked into the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , with plenty of questions for the woman accused along with her husband of luring a man with a @entity10 ad , then killing him			1
he walked out with a bombshell of a story that 's sent police and the press alike scrambling for answers			0
@entity16 told @entity0 , a reporter for the @entity18 newspaper in @entity2 , that she 'd killed before			1
and not just once or twice			0
" she said , she has , you know , done this before , " @entity0 told @entity21 affiliate @entity20 of his friday interview with the 19 - year - old murder suspect			1
" and i said , ' what 's the actual number ? ' " " and she said , ' under a hundred , ' " @entity0 told the station			2
@entity32 said she had stopped counting at 22 killings , according to @entity0 's story in the @entity18			1
" she kind of floored me , " @entity0 told @entity21 affiliate @entity35			2
@entity32 told the @entity18 that the killings occurred over the past six years in @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			1
that 's sent investigators in those states back to their cold - case files , but it 's also raising questions among people who study serial killers			1
" anything is possible , and of course it 's conceivable that she 's a serial killer , " @entity50 criminologist @entity49 told @entity21			1
but he said few women are serial killers , and those few are typically older and do n't use knives , as @entity32 is accused of doing in the @entity3 case			1
authorities have n't yet corroborated any of @entity32 's claims , including statements that she was involved in @entity62			1
her alleged confession has raised questions among attorneys , missing persons experts and even a representative of the @entity68 , the nation 's largest satanic body			2
" thorough investigation will likely demonstrate that this cult story is fiction , " said @entity71 , the @entity72 - based head of the @entity68			2
in @entity37 , state police are looking into the claims and will pursue " any leads that may present themselves , " @entity77 spokeswoman @entity76 told @entity21			2
and @entity82 , the founder of a missing persons center in @entity39 , said her phone started ringing sunday night with questions from families whose loved ones have n't turned up in years			2
" it sends everybody into a panic mode -- a hopeful panic mode , " @entity82 said			0
" they want to be one of those , but they do n't want to be one of those			2
they want their nightmare to end			0
" police : newlyweds lure man through @entity10 for thrill killing 2013 killing in the one case in which authorities say they have pinned down @entity32 's involvement , she and her husband , @entity16 , 22 , are accused of killing 42 - year - old @entity106 , who police say responded to a " companionship " ad placed by @entity16 on @entity10			1
the couple just wanted to kill someone together , police said			0
they had been married for only three weeks at the time of the slaying , and had moved from @entity39 to @entity3 after tying the knot			0
police say @entity16 strangled @entity106 in the front seat of her red @entity119 while @entity16 stabbed him at least 20 times in november 2013			1
@entity106 's body was found the next day in the backyard of a home in @entity2 , a small city about 100 miles northwest of @entity126			0
the last number dialed on his cell phone led police to the @entity130 , according to authorities			0
@entity32 claimed she began killing when she was 13 and involved in a satanic cult , @entity0 reported			1
" i can pinpoint on a map where you can find them , " he quoted her as saying of the bodies			0
but she said @entity106 's killing was the @entity130 ' first as a couple			2
@entity16 told police at the time of his arrest that he and his wife had tried to kill others , but the plans did n't work out			1
both @entity130 face several charges in @entity106 's death , including murder			0
despite @entity16 's statements to @entity0 , both have pleaded not guilty			2
@entity32 's attorney , public defender @entity151 , told @entity21 he did n't know she was planning to give the interview			1
he declined to comment on her claims			2
but @entity49 said the way @entity156 's body was left in someone 's yard is n't typical of serial killers			2
" if you 're a prolific serial killer , you 're going to go out of your way to dump the body in a desolate area off a highway so that people do n't find the evidence , " he said			1
satanists : accused @entity10 killer not one of us claims raise doubts @entity2 police chief @entity172 told @entity21 that investigators have been in contact with the @entity175 and law enforcement in some of the states where @entity32 has lived			1
the father of @entity32 's 1 - year - old child is dead , and @entity2 police have said that is part of their investigation			1
" we investigate all leads just because that 's the proper protocol to follow through , " @entity172 said			0
authorities also are looking closely at @entity32 's claims that she was involved in @entity62 , according to another law enforcement source close to the investigation			1
but @entity71 , of the @entity68 , said his church has a " law and order philosophy " that does not condone killing			0
he said the church has had no contact with @entity16 or her husband			1
@entity82 , the founder of the @entity200 - based @entity199 for @entity201 , has worked with murderers before in hopes of bringing closure to people whose loved ones have n't been seen in years			1
in 2009 , her organization helped find the body of @entity209 , who was abducted and murdered seven years earlier , after @entity211 's convicted killer wrote to tell @entity82 where the remains could be found			0
" anytime anything like this happens , we start getting e-mails and phone calls			0
i started getting texts last night , " @entity82 said			0
but she said @entity32 will have to be questioned extensively by investigators before those claims can be put to the test			1
" you ca n't just say you 've killed 22 people between this region and that region , " @entity82 said			1
" you 've got to give a town or something that only police or an organization like us would know			0
" without details like the gender , age or race of a victim , " we do n't even know where to start , " she said			1
and like @entity49 , she cast doubt on @entity32 's claims			1
" that 's a lot of people to kill in such a short time , and being so young and never making a mistake , i 'm hard pressed to believe that amount , " she said			0
and for the families she works with , " you do n't want to build any false hope			0
" getting the interview @entity0 told @entity20 he got the interview after @entity32 sent him a letter saying she wanted to talk			1
@entity0 told @entity21 on sunday that he was not allowed to bring a notepad or any other recording device into the interview			0
he said police allowed him to listen to the interview after it was conducted			0
in his interview with @entity20 , @entity0 described @entity32 as " very meek , very mild " with a " very low voice			2
" " she never hesitated once , " he told the station			0
" she never gave the impression of it was a rehearsal			0
" @entity0 said he eventually asked if she had any remorse			0
" and she said , ' none , ' " @entity0 told @entity20			0
but that 's not what @entity0 said he found most surprising			0
that would be , he said , " the fact that she said that if she got out she would do it again			0
