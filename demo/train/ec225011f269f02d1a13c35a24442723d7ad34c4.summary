-- in 1988 , the @entity2 hip - hop group @entity3 released a provocative song called " @entity5 , " which stirred controversy and marked it as one of the most high - profile examples of tension between the black community in @entity11 and authorities			0
a few years later tensions erupted into rioting and violence in that city following the acquittal of @entity11 police officers in the videotaped beating of motorist @entity20			1
those two incidents , and whether the former helped spark the latter , is just one of the topics explored in the documentary " uprising : @entity28 and the @entity29 , " which airs at 9 et tuesday night on @entity30			1
the project was the brainchild of director @entity33 and executive producer @entity34 , both of whose professional credits include stints at @entity0			2
the pair told @entity0 earlier this year at the @entity40 music , film and technology festival that the documentary was an idea they had long thought of bringing to the small screen			1
" we had worked together on a documentary about @entity3 a few years ago , " @entity33 said			2
" that was always in my mind , the song ' @entity5 ' and how powerful it was , and was there a connection between that song and what happened years later ? " @entity34 added , " we have the @entity58 franchise at @entity30 , and i always look for film and subjects that transcend music and that impact social and cultural ways of living , and this felt like one of those			1
it was a huge moment in time for @entity69 , and there was a music angle that no one had ever looked into			2
" now 20 years after the riots , the rapper @entity73 narrates the documentary , which includes appearances and commentary from other rap stars , including @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			1
in the film , @entity79 notes that " @entity20 was the confirmation of everything we had been rapping about since the early ' 70s			2
" " @entity87 " director @entity86 , who is featured in the documentary , told @entity0 , " it was almost as if the riot legitimized everything we were trying to do as artists and show the world what was happening in our neighborhoods			1
" the filmmakers gained access to several people connected to the riots , including @entity99 , who participated in the beating of white truck driver @entity101 following police officers ' acquittal in the @entity20 case			1
@entity99 has long maintained his silence , but @entity106 and @entity34 were able to get him to open up on film in a moment that shows him shrugging when asked if he regrets his part in the assault on @entity101			2
" ( @entity99 ) pretty much tells it like it is , " @entity33 said			0
" that was a very interesting thing to explore , that 20 years later even people who participated in the looting , @entity73 being one of them , are n't incredibly repentant or apologetic about it , " he added			0
" they look at it as something that happened ; it was a moment in time that was a frenzied and mob feeling			0
" former talk - show host @entity121 appears in " uprising " and attended a recent screening and panel discussion about the film			1
as the 20th anniversary of the riots is marked , @entity121 said the country must never forget			0
" here we are 20 years later , but it 's almost like the battle against @entity133 , " @entity121 said			0
" if we stop talking about it , people get careless , and they stop remembering that we 're on a mission			0
" @entity33 and @entity34 said they are aware some may take offense at the title " uprising , " viewing the events as more of a crime than a revolution			0
but @entity33 said he hopes viewers come away from the documentary with a different message			1
" it shows how powerful music can be , what it can do and what it means to people , " he said			1
" i hope what people really take away from it is for us to pay attention to the suffering going on in our society			0
it just so happened at that time , hip - hop was about the only place you could hear the messages being told			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
