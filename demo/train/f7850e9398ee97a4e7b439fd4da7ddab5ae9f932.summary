-- a bird with an estimated 20 - to 24 - foot wingspan was identified in @entity3			0
there 's evidence that dinosaurs roamed what 's now a national park in @entity9 , and a 9 - foot - tall stegomastodon was unearthed in @entity11			1
and those are just the fossil finds made across the @entity14 this summer			1
if you 're fascinated by magnificent prehistoric creatures , there 's plenty more exploration to be done			0
no need to worry about a @entity21 attack			0
these eight " fossil finds " offer unique family - friendly , @entity23 - free ways for paleontologists of all ages to explore prehistoric life			1
so pack up your family and start uncovering some of the planet 's most fascinating previous inhabitants			0
@entity33 , @entity9 just this month , as tracks of large , plant - eating dinosaur herds were discovered in @entity9 's @entity33 , scientists gained a new picture of prehistoric @entity39 wildlife			1
the tracks ranged from 5 to 24 inches and came from hadrosaurs -- plant - eating , duck - billed dinosaurs			0
hadrosaurs were prevalent during the @entity44 nearly 70 million years ago , and the new tracks only add to @entity9 's rich dinosaur history			1
" we discovered the first dinosaur tracks in 2005 , and now since we know what to look for , we 've since discovered thousands of tracks , " said @entity33 park ranger @entity47			1
" here , these tracks are unique because it houses traces of the entire ecosystem , " she said			0
" birds , insects and plant life -- it really paints a picture of what life was in the area			0
" the tracks are not accessible through guided hikes or paved trails , but experienced hikers can find them nestled in @entity33 's back country , @entity47 said			1
@entity69 , @entity70 what exactly is a beardog ? take a tour through the @entity69 in @entity70 , where 20 million years ago the land now known as the @entity75 was a grassy plain comparable to @entity78 's @entity77			1
at @entity75 , roaming animals once included the beardog ( @entity81 ) , a 6 - foot - long hunting creature that actually is not related to the bear or the dog			0
there 's also evidence of the dinohyus ( large pig - like animal ) and a short rhinoceros called a @entity91			0
as rock weathered and terrain shifted , these species died off and became fossilized , and they are now visible in the @entity75 cliffs			0
@entity96 , @entity97 stake your claim at the @entity100 and fossil pit , an excavation site about 230 miles northeast of @entity103 where visitors can dig for fossils			1
@entity107 's marine fossils date to the @entity108 , about 400 million years ago			1
and even more fun : all collected artifacts are yours to keep			0
fossils include trilobites ( relatives of horseshoe crabs with segmented bodies and frog - like eyes ) , pelecypods ( early ancestors of oysters , mussels and clams ) and gastropods ( snails )			1
one tip : wait until after a good rain shower to go fossil hunting			1
sometimes the rain can make the fossils easier to spot in the rock			2
@entity129 , @entity130 the @entity131 is the unquestioned star of @entity129 's show			0
about 1,500 dinosaur bones from up to 149 million years ago and an 80 - foot mural reveal the history of the dinosaurs and their eventual demise			1
bone displays include meat - eating reptiles like the 20 - foot long allosaurus and massive , grass - eating dinos like the @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
outside the exhibit hall , this monument to dinosaurs still has a rich variety of wildlife throughout the area			0
adventurous visitors can take a whitewater rafting trip through remote canyon areas			2
@entity155 , @entity156 @entity155 is a fossil lover 's heaven			2
expansive and well - preserved , the rock bed formation spans four states -- @entity156 , @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 -- although the main park is squarely in @entity156			0
fossils date to the late @entity166 period , 65 million to 70 million years ago , and were discovered in 1902 by paleontologist @entity167			1
today , families can take guided , private day digging tours with experienced paleontologists to hunt fossils			2
and in @entity155 , abundant species include the distinctively horned ceratopsians ; the duck - billed herbivore creatures called hadrosaurs ; and theropods , the lizard - like carnivorous dinosaurs			0
but there 's another reason historians love the @entity155 beds : the chemical presence of iridium in some rocks gives credence to the theory of a dinosaur extinction caused by a meteor			2
@entity191 , @entity11 @entity192 ( @entity194 ) buster at this spot 's @entity195			0
this new @entity198 museum includes bones of the coelophysis , a slender , two - legged carnivore that was over 9 feet long and grazed the ranch 's grassy plains nearly 220 million years ago			1
other dinosaurs on display include the 6 - foot - long therapod @entity206 and @entity207 , an underwater reptile			0
after a tour of the museum , venture into the @entity210 , where red beds of rock have preserved the remains of at least 1,000 rare species			0
@entity215 , @entity162 with walkways and set excavation areas , @entity215 in @entity162 is the perfect site for an introduction to paleontology and dino - digging			0
@entity222 , the track site , named for being an area where footprints and fossils are preserved , includes managers of the excavation sites to help beginning visitors identify dinosaur tracks in the sand			1
fossil collection is permitted on most days , barring road closures and fire danger , and the rewards for a fossil hunt are great			2
trilobites , brachiopods ( shell creatures ) and all invertebrate fossils can be collected for personal use and without permit			2
and some of those fossils date 167 million years			1
however , if you want to search like a professional paleontologist for vertebrate fossils -- with bones and teeth -- a permit is required			2
@entity250 at the @entity250 , @entity251 they call it excavation 101			0
and it begins with a fossil deposit , a grid and the careful removal of dirt to find a bone			1
part of the @entity250 in @entity261 , the @entity250 ' outside pits and the museum 's inside exhibits create a must - see attraction for @entity267 fossil lovers			2
there are outside options where viewers can observe excavations of @entity251 's rich wildlife , explore prehistoric fossils and learn the basics of excavation			2
at the @entity250 , visitors look at expansive fossil exhibits , including full replicas of the smilodon , an extinct saber - toothed cat			1
the museum 's @entity281 allows visitors to peer though the glass walls to watch fossils get cleaned , enhanced and prepared for viewing .			1

there have been dinosaur finds across the @entity14 this summer
one recently unearthed stegomastodon fossil is 3 million years old
some spots allow visitors to keep the fossils they find
