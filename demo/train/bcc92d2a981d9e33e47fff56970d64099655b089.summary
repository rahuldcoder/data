@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's body is broken , courtesy of a sniper who blew holes in the soldier 's left leg and left hand			1
the wounds are so fresh that blood seeps through the bandages			1
he winces as he struggles to try to sit up before giving up and lying back down on the gurney			1
staring up at the stained hospital ceiling , @entity4 recounts the fierce firefight wednesday on the streets of @entity19 that landed him here			1
across the room , a border guard wounded in the battle for the @entity24 border crossing writhes in pain as doctors examine his legs , which are being held by metal rods rather than bone			1
in the corner , an @entity1 special forces soldier is wrapped in bandages from gunshot wounds he received in a firefight outside of @entity35			1
these are just a few of the dozens of the war 's wounded that @entity2 saw thursday being treated at a hospital in the heart of the @entity1 capital where soldiers , police and border guards are packed four , five and six , in some cases , to a room			1
their stories paint a fuller picture of frontline battles detailed at near daily news briefings conducted by @entity1 's military spokesman , lt. gen. @entity52 , who cites the military 's " success " in battling the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) and their @entity55 militant allies			1
he offers up a laundry list of information , from the number of air strikes carried out to the number of @entity53 fighters killed			1
but @entity52 has offered no details about how many of the country 's security forces have been killed or wounded			1
the ministries of defense and interior have also declined a @entity2 request for the number of casualties			2
but the anecdotal evidence , in the form of personal accounts from the wounded and the families of the dead , paint a picture of an @entity1 military that is still very much fighting to hold ground in some areas against @entity53			1
@entity4 , 28 , joined the military three years ago as a way to provide for his family , who live south of @entity0 in the city of @entity87			2
three months ago , he was deployed to @entity19 as part of the government 's effort to hold the provincial capital after nearby @entity92 was overrun by @entity53 fighters , a bellwether of what was to come for @entity1			1
observers predicted the city would fall to @entity53 after the extremists swept across the @entity100 border last month in a lightning offensive that saw them seize large swaths of northern and western @entity1			1
but the city has held			2
or at least a part of it			2
" we ran out of ammunition , and we called back to the base and they said to come back , " he said			2
as they started to withdraw on wednesday , snipers opened fire			2
when it was over , he and five of his comrades were wounded and two were dead			2
" they were still shooting but someone drove a humvee to us , and he carried us out , " @entity4 said			2
within hours , he was transported to the hospital in @entity0 , where doctors have told him he will be released and sent home in a week			2
maybe less , he says			2
" they told me they need the room , " @entity4 said			2
' my friends , they carried me ' on the other side of the room , @entity131 's mother tends to him , bringing him food and water			0
he is @entity136 's only son , and she is worried about his prognosis			0
the x-rays that hang in a plastic shopping bag off the bed tells the tale : a shattered tibia and fibula in his right leg			0
a portion of the bone is missing , lost perhaps when @entity53 fighters shot him as he was running			1
@entity131 , 29 , of @entity149 , was at @entity24 when @entity53 fighters swept across , pushing the @entity1 military and the border guards from their posts after they ran out of ammunition and supplies			1
rather than surrender to @entity53 , he and 10 of his fellow border patrol officers ran six kilometers to a police station			1
but when they arrived , he says , there was nobody there			0
with what little weapons and ammunition they had left , they barricaded themselves in the building and fought back			0
one by one , his comrades were shot and killed			0
with eight men dead , it was clear they could n't hold out until help arrived , he said			0
that 's when he and two others decided to make a run for it at night			0
@entity131 said he bolted from the building , only making it a short distance before he was gunned down			0
he never saw who shot him			0
laying in the hospital bed , @entity131 covers his eyes with his forearm , not wanting anyone to see the tears he can no longer hold back			0
" my friends , they carried me , " he said			0
evacuated from front line @entity189 , 29 , lies in the hospital bed next to @entity131 , and listens to the story			1
he tells him in @entity192 , " it will be ok			0
" @entity189 , an army lieutenant , knows it wo n't really be ok for the men in the room			1
if they are lucky , they will walk again			0
not perfectly , but enough to live a life			0
" this is what happens when you fight , " he said			0
@entity189 was hit by shrapnel during a mortar barrage in @entity206 this week that left the femur in his left leg broken in several places			0
when asked about government reports that @entity1 troops were successfully retaking @entity213 's hometown , 160 kilometers north of @entity0 , he shook his head			1
at one point , he said he and his troops appeared to be surrounded by @entity53 fighters			1
" no food , no water , " he said			0
they had to drink water from streams			0
ammunition was also running low , he said			0
@entity189 said he was evacuated from the front line by the army			1
in his hospital bed , he looks down at the long thin screws that have been twisted into his leg to hold the pieces of bone together			0
at least , he says , he 's alive and he will one day go home			0
some of his comrades were n't so lucky			0
@entity1 's orphans left to ask : ' why do these people kill other people ? '			1

@entity1 army soldiers , border guards , tell stories from the front line
@entity53 fighters are taking over large swaths of northern , western @entity1
*civilians* are also caught in the *crossfire*
