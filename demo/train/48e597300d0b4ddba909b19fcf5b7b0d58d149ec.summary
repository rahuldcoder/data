about every two weeks , @entity0 gets a series of thermal snapshots from high above @entity3 that show how water gets used across the western @entity5 , a perennial source of friction in the largely arid region			1
" we see all of the cold spots , which are irrigated fields , " said @entity0 , the director of the @entity9 at the @entity10			0
" we take the relative temperatures and transform that into an equivalent of an amount of water used in cubic feet per acre per day , or cubic meters , or inches of depth			0
we can transform that information into types of units that are used by water managers and state agencies to manage water consumption			0
" the stream of data that @entity0 dips into has been flowing since 1984 , when @entity33 's @entity32 satellite went into orbit			1
@entity32 5 finally shut down in november , and it successor , @entity32 7 , beams back a set of images of @entity0 's region to the @entity40 every 16 days -- but because of a faulty scanner , they come in with black streaks across them			0
a replacement is being readied for launch , but it 's unlikely to make it aloft before january			0
" we 'll be hobbling through the year 2012 using only @entity48 7 with incomplete imagery , " @entity0 said			1
" that 's really hurting us badly			0
" it 's a problem facing other scientists as well , as a combination of budget pressure , program delays and a pair of launch failures leaves the @entity5 facing a " rapid decline " in its fleet of @entity3 - science satellites , the @entity58 warns			1
of 23 such satellites now aloft -- carrying dozens of instruments that help weather forecasters produce storm warnings and measure pollution , ocean winds and sea levels -- only six are expected to remain in operation by 2020 , and efforts to replace them have stalled , the @entity62 reports			1
" these precipitous decreases warn of a coming crisis in @entity3 observations from space , in which our ability to observe and understand the @entity3 system will decline just as @entity3 observations are critically needed to underpin important decisions facing our nation and the world , " according to a may report from the @entity58 's @entity62			1
" advances in weather forecast accuracy may slow or even reverse , and gaps in time series of climate and other critical @entity3 observations are almost certain to occur			1
" @entity33 calls the report " overly pessimistic , " however			1
in a statement to @entity95 , the space agency says many of its satellites have lasted far beyond their expected lifetimes , and that scientists are getting regular data from other countries ' probes			2
" @entity33 is developing a set of missions that will both continue critical long - term data records and demonstrate new instruments and measurement approaches for important variables that are not presently being measured from space , " it said			1
" our research portfolio remains robust			0
" the @entity62 report follows up on a 2007 study that recommended a list of 17 satellite missions for the next decade			1
but @entity117 , who led the committee that produced the new report , said none of those have launched " because of a variety of reasons			2
" " they did n't get as much money to use as the decadal survey assumed , " said @entity117 , an atmospheric science professor at the @entity124			0
" some things cost more , especially launch vehicles , so the overall cost has gone up			0
" meanwhile , science budgets for both @entity33 and @entity132 are n't keeping pace with inflation , he said , and @entity33 has lost two previously planned missions after liftoff			1
the 2009 @entity138 was to have measured the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , while 2011 's glory would have measured solar radiation and atmospheric aerosols			0
both crashed into the @entity146 when the shell around the satellites failed to break away from the boosters			1
the kind of observations those probes send back are critical for climate researchers like @entity154 , at @entity33 's @entity155 in @entity156			1
@entity154 relies on radar imaging from the @entity159 satellite , which monitors the rise in sea levels scientists say is a sign of a rise in global temperatures			2
@entity159 's expected lifetime is up in mid- 2013 , but its scheduled replacement , @entity159 , is n't likely to be launched until late 2014			0
if the current satellite goes out before the new one goes up , it would break a string of uninterrupted observations that date back to the early 1990s			2
" one of the reasons it 's so good and powerful is we 've been able to link together the satellite records before the last one gets old -- we 've been able to fly a new one and get some overlap , " @entity154 said			2
" what 's important is not just what sea level is today , but how today 's sea level relates back to the past			0
" the @entity33 - launched , @entity132 - funded satellite , about the size of a refrigerator , scans nearly all of @entity3 's ocean surfaces every 10 days from about 800 miles up			1
it has been orbiting since 2008 -- and while its lifespan is officially five years , @entity154 said its predecessor @entity192 is still functioning at 10			0
" it 's not super-healthy , but it 's still collecting data and it 's still being used , " he said			0
of the 17 recommended missions in the 2007 survey , 15 are still in the study and review phases , @entity33 spokesman @entity196 told @entity95			2
the remaining two are expected to launch by 2016 , along with a replacement for the @entity138			0
in the meantime , the space agency is using more aircraft flyovers to take the place of satellite observations of the @entity208 and @entity209			0
the program , known as @entity211 , is aimed at filling a gap between the shutdown of the @entity215 orbiter in 2010 and the espected launch of its successor , @entity215 , in 2015			0
but the report by @entity117 's committee noted that the flights " must leave unobserved large portions of the major ice sheets and sea ice " until regular space - based observations resume			2
@entity33 is already running two other airborne missions and plans to announce more in the coming year , @entity196 said			1
and @entity132 , which manages many of the satellite programs once the hardware has reached orbit , has also made arrangements to share data from a @entity234 satellite launched last week			1
the first of a new series of @entity132 satellites aimed at boosting the accuracy of long - range forecasts went into orbit in 2011 , and it also carries instruments that monitor ozone levels , energy from sunlight and moisture in the air .			2

*tights* budgets , growing costs and failed launches hurt satellite programs , report finds
" we 'll be hobbling through the year 2012 , " @entity255 scientist says
nearly three - quarters of 23 @entity3 - observation satellites could go dark by 2020
@entity33 calls the report " overly pessimistic "
