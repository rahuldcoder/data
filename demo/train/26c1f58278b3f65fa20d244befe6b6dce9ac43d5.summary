@entity1 's plans for a new nuclear test , like most things that happen inside the reclusive state , are shrouded in mystery			1
but that 's not stopping analysts and officials from making some informed guesses about what 's going on			2
why is @entity1 planning to conduct a nuclear test ? the @entity12 says the " higher level " test is part of its military deterrent in its confrontation with the @entity18 , which it describes as " the sworn enemy of the @entity1 people			1
" its declaration that it would carry out the test came just two days after the @entity25 @entity24 voted in favor of imposing broader sanctions on the regime in response to @entity31 's long - range rocket launch in december that was widely viewed as a test of ballistic missile technology			2
the pattern of events is similar to the lead - up to the previous nuclear tests @entity1 carried out in 2006 and 2009			1
@entity38 appears likely to shrug off pressure from most of the international community , including @entity1 's main ally , @entity42 , and go ahead with a third test			1
" neither the prospect of stronger sanctions , nor the growing discontent of @entity53 and @entity42 with his behavior , appears to deter @entity1 's young leader , " @entity44 , professor of peace studies at the @entity46 , @entity47 , wrote in an opinion article this week for @entity49			2
under the @entity12 's power - driven ideology of songun , or " military first , " the punishment meted out last month by the @entity24 requires a strong response , according to @entity62 , senior analyst for the @entity63 covering @entity64			0
@entity1 " sees international law , international institutions , collective security , arms control and any other cooperative arrangement as undesirable and as schemes to undermine their national security , " @entity62 said in a recent blog post			2
a new test will also give @entity1 a chance to underscore advances in its nuclear program , potentially moving it closer to a nuclear weapon that it can mount on a long - range missile			1
" to make its nuclear arsenal more menacing and provide the deterrent power @entity31 's vitriolic pronouncements are aimed to achieve , @entity1 must demonstrate that it can deliver the weapons on missiles at a distance , " @entity80 , a @entity81 professor who has visited @entity1 nuclear facilities , wrote in an article for @entity84 this week			1
when is it likely to happen ? given that @entity1 is one of the most isolated , secretive regimes on the planet , one that views much of the rest of the world with suspicion , getting a clear idea of what exactly it plans to do when is often far from straightforward			2
its announcement last month that it would go ahead with a nuclear test did n't provide a time - frame , so analysts and government officials around the globe are interpreting satellite images of the test zone and parsing the language in state media reports for clues			1
most of them agree that @entity1 is technically ready and could carry out a test at any time			1
the question is when the top leaders in @entity31 will give the political green light to go ahead with a move that is likely to further sour relations with the country 's @entity121 neighbors and the @entity18			0
" i think by their political calculations , this is where they 're going to have , so to say , the most bang for the buck and make it most effective for what they want to try to accomplish , " said @entity123 , executive director of the @entity124 , a @entity18 - based foundation that seeks to stop the spread of nuclear weapons			0
@entity123 said this week that @entity1 's recent statements suggest a test is " imminent			1
" @entity1 on @entity139 : monuments , nuclear complex , gulags how will other countries know if it has happened ? the test is expected to take place underground at the @entity12 's @entity148 nuclear facility , and the first indications that a test has taken place are likely to show up on earthquake - monitoring equipment			1
the area around @entity148 has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards , according to @entity157 ( @entity157 ) maps			0
but the previous test , in 2009 , registered as a seismic event with a magnitude between 4 and 5			0
besides earthquake - monitoring organizations like the @entity157 , the @entity164 in @entity165 , has a network of seismic , sonar and radiation instruments designed to pick up nuclear tests			0
it also has sensors that can detect gases that may leak into the atmosphere from the explosion			0
but determining the sophistication of the nuclear device , and what kind of material -- plutonium or uranium -- was used , will be considerably more difficult , experts say			1
at some point , @entity1 is likely to announce that the explosion has taken place			1
" @entity31 will almost certainly claim that the test was successful and will tout its sophistication			0
it will be difficult to distinguish truth from propaganda , but experience shows there is often a nugget of truth in @entity1 's claims , " @entity81 's @entity80 says			2
@entity193 cast wary eyes to the @entity12 what stage will @entity1 's nuclear weapons program be at following a new test ? with hard facts about the test so scarce , analysts are busy theorizing what exactly @entity1 means when it says the test will be of a " higher level			1
" there is a widespread expectation that it will involve the use of highly enriched uranium , whereas the country 's two previous tests are understood to have involved plutonium - based devices			0
" a successful uranium test indicates that @entity31 has advanced centrifuge technologies and related support systems , " @entity47 's @entity44 said			0
" it means that @entity1 , if left unchecked , can both produce and export such material			2
" in an article for the @entity219 last year , @entity80 and another analyst , @entity217 , speculated that @entity1 could test two devices at the same time , one using plutonium and the other uranium			1
" two detonations will yield much more technical information than one , and they will be no more damaging politically than if @entity1 conducted a single test , " they wrote			1
some observers have even suggested that @entity31 could make an early attempt at testing a thermonuclear device , which uses nuclear fusion to create a more powerful explosion			0
but others say they do n't believe the @entity12 has that ability within its grasp yet			0
in any case , the test is expected to take @entity1 closer to having a nuclear weapon it can direct at its enemies			1
but actually achieving that goal still remains a longer - term effort , according to @entity242 , president of the @entity124			0
" i still think we 're years away from @entity1 having a capability to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile even to a country as close as @entity248 or @entity193 , " @entity242 said recently			2
" and they 're even further away from having a long - range missile that could hit the @entity18			0
" what are the consequences likely to be ? the region is already braced for the test to take place , and countries like the @entity18 , @entity193 and @entity248 are already preparing their response			2
@entity258 , the new @entity18 secretary of state , spoke to his counterparts in @entity260 and @entity261 by phone on sunday , and all of three of them agreed that the @entity12 must understand " that it will face significant consequences from the international community if it continues its provocative behavior , " according to a summary of the calls from the @entity267 a push for fresh condemnation and sanctions from the @entity24 is likely , but whether or not the new measures have much bite depends on @entity42			0
in the event of a new nuclear test , @entity278 is likely " reduce its assistance to @entity1 , " the the state - run @entity42 newspaper @entity276 said in an editorial last month			1
but it added that " if the @entity18 , @entity248 and @entity193 promote extreme @entity25 sanctions on @entity1 , @entity42 will resolutely stop them and force them to amend these draft resolutions			2
" fundamentally , analysts say , a new test wo n't upend the geopolitical situation in @entity64			0
but it will seriously harm the chances of any meaningful dialog between @entity31 , @entity261 and @entity291 in the near future			0
" it will signal that the new regime , like its predecessors , has chosen bombs over electricity " for its impoverished population , @entity80 wrote			0
another test also increases concerns about where @entity1 's nuclear material will end up in the long term , either because it decides to sell it or in the event of a collapse of the regime , according to @entity305			1
" that 's something that we really have to be concerned about , " he said .			0

@entity1 has vowed to carry out a " higher level " test
experts and officials say it could take place at any time
opinions vary on exactly what kind of test it may carry out
another nuclear test is likely to further strain relations in @entity322
