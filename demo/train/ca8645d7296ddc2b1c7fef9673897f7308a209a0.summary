-- it 's the sixth of october , 2005 , a crisp indian summer day in @entity3 , and we 're sitting in the dining room of our @entity7 apartment			1
outside the window , against the cobalt blue sky , looms the @entity10 , where @entity11 and i were married , where my brother , tall and handsome in his morning suit , walked me up the aisle and , in my father 's stead , gave me away			1
now , almost forty years later , he 's come alone for a single night , bringing with him a whiff of unease , even alarm			1
first it was his wife 's last - minute cancellation , and now it 's the formality with which he 's summoned us to the table ... like one of those scenes from @entity28 , when the detectives have to tell the family a loved one is dead			1
named @entity33 , after our father , he 's always been known in the family as @entity34 ( pronounced " @entity35 " as in " chin " )			1
in addition to being the only immediate family we have ( @entity11 and i had no children , and @entity11 's brother died in a sky - diving accident when he was twenty - eight ) , @entity34 is the one we turn to for help in so many waysâ € ” all those areas in which we are inept			1
from the humbly domestic ( what temperature should the refrigerator be ? @entity34 travels with a special thermometer ) to the technological to the arcane ways of money and finance ( he 's a financial adviser by profession and a rationalist by avocation ) , my brother is a fixer of problems and a fount of common sense , generous with his time as if there were no end to it			1
in recent years , the only time i can remember being vexed with him was in this very dining room			1
@entity11 and i were giving a party that required removing a leaf of the chrome and glass table			1
as @entity34 and @entity73 were up visiting , he offered to help remove the panel , but the heavy glass , detached from its chrome frame , dropped and shattered			1
if @entity11 had perpetrated this domestic calamity , it would have been exasperating but unsurprising			2
at the hands of my hyper - competent brother , it was almost comically out of character			1
and now he is about to shatter normalcy in our dining room again , in a way that i would have said was out of character if i knew what character was and if character had anything to do with it			2
i 'm terrified it 's some fatal illness , possibly @entity92 ( @entity94 's disease ) , the degenerative neurological disorder from which our father died			1
without our ever talking about it , that possibility has been a constant in our lives			1
sensing this , he immediately disposes of it : he 's not dying and he does n't have an illness in the ordinary sense			1
" i have what 's known as gender dysphoria , " he says			1
" for most of my life , i 've felt i should have been born female			2
and now i 'm going to become one			2
how can this be ? @entity34 , my brother ! @entity11 's brother - in - law ! he 's so utterly normal			1
there 's no sudden memory , no flash , no " of course			1
" he was ( and is ) a manly guyâ € ” no trace of effeminacy or kid in a tutuâ € ” who , if not captain of the football team or a hell - raising , beer - swilling male chauvinist , was always plenty virile , and there were two wives who 'd have so attested			2
when did he know ? " since way back , early childhood , " he tells me , " i had confusing urges , feminine longings , but even in puberty i simply had no concept for what i was experiencing			2
" " you mean , as the expression has it , a female trapped in a male body ? " " nothing as clear as that , but just confused feelings , a desire to dress and feel like a girl , not very strong at first			2
" a desire , it seems , for which neither he nor society had words			2
his marriages were good , even sexually , but part of everyday was increasingly spent in something like agony , imagining himself a woman			1
i 'm suddenly struck by two odd memories			2
in the later years of his second marriage , he became anorexic			2
@entity73 and i kept asking , even nagging , him about it , but he insisted he was doing it to keep his cholesterol down , with his internist 's approval			1
" i was trying to change my body shape , " he now admits			2
the other image seems even more telling			2
for as long as i can remember , he would pick at the skin at his fingertips , almost like an animal gnawing its own flesh , till his fingers became raw			2
" i was trying to get out of my skin , " he says			0
and now , in effect , he will			0
she has to be devastated			0
they 've had what to all appearances is a wonderful marriage , worked and travelled and built a life together that is about to splinter at the seams			0
they 're separating , he tells me , and eventually he will move to a mountain condo the two of them bought some years ago			0
when i ask how she 's dealing with it , @entity34 's calm voice wavers			1
" she 's having a hard time			1
i think she 's struggling less with the idea of me being transsexual than with losing the marriage			1
a year and a half before we got married , i told her i had had this problem but i thought i had it under control			0
" " why now , at this late date ? " " because , " he explains , " the urge gets stronger , not weaker			0
you just do n't want to go to your grave in what you believe is the wrong body			0
" i ask him if he ever thought of doing it earlier , if it was the reason he and @entity211 , his first wife , got divorced			0
he separated from @entity211 in 1976			0
we were all mystified , so joined at the hip were the two			0
they 'd been together since puberty , had dated other people but always come back together			0
" yes , i took hormones , " he says			0
" i was going to change			0
" he bought a charming @entity220 house in @entity222 's @entity221 and had it rezoned so that it could serve as a financial management consultancy below and residence above			1
and then he realized he could n't do it			0
@entity230 , his son with @entity211 , was still alive , @entity229 was alive , the doctors he went to presented a confusing picture ; there was no internet , no information , no guidance			0
" i did n't anticipate the intensity of the drive			0
to the point that not having the sex change is no longer an option			0
from the outside it looks like a selfish act , but from the inside not at all			0
i had a ' happy ' life before , and i 'm destroying it all			0
it 's nothing to do with happiness			1
i had happiness in all those normal senses			0
" it 's like ... " he pauses			1
" well , imagine you 're a paraplegic , and they tell you they can give you movement in your legs , but you 'll have to use a cane			0
of course you 'd jump at the opportunity			0
i 'll go further , " he continues			0
" i 'd rather die in surgery trying to become a woman than live the rest of my life fighting it			1
the only way i would n't go through with the surgery is if there were a 100 percent chance of death			0
" spoken in his calm , determined voice , rational to the end , this is so chilling it takes my breath away .			0
