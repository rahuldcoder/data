@entity0 , @entity1 -- when trouble strikes in our personal lives and we are searching for a source , it usually makes sense to take a look in a familiar place -- the mirror			1
and so it should be in our troubled politics today			2
many of us are deeply angry at politicians in @entity16 and the broken government they have created			1
we tend to look down upon them as jackasses and ideologues who are incapable of organizing a two - car funeral			2
we blame special interests for capturing them , a 24/7 media for encouraging them , and power for corrupting them			2
indeed , a list of reasons for broken government could -- and will -- fill a week of columns			1
but perhaps we give too little attention to the basic notion that our politicians are also a reflection of the public they represent			2
as the old saying goes , we get the president we deserve -- and usually the @entity38 , too			2
in truth , our fractured politics are due in no small part to a fractured country -- one in which consensus and moderation are disappearing			2
with apologies to president @entity48 : the buck stops here			2
those of us who are older -- born somewhere close to midcentury -- grew up in an @entity52 where there was a general consensus that the @entity52 was a great nation , that you could be a success if you worked hard and played by the rules , that government had a positive role to play when trouble hit , and that politics must stop at the water 's edge as we united against dangerous enemies			1
but with @entity65 , the tumult of the ' 60s and ' 70s , @entity67 and more , our sense of common purpose began collapsing			2
listen for a moment to three of the smartest observers in the country who have weighed in this week on the collapse			2
in this week 's @entity73 , columnist @entity72 argues that by the late 1960s , " the bipartisan national consensus over the central role of government -- which had held firm through the @entity77 , @entity48 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity81 administrations -- was kaput			1
the @entity83 revolution was in the wings			2
" we also began to lose faith in ourselves and our values			0
in an interview with the @entity90 early this week , professor @entity87 of the @entity88 chimed in with pained observations about what is happening to @entity52 competitiveness : " this is shocking for the @entity52 if you go back 100 years , you find that the @entity52 was a huge pioneer in public education			1
... the @entity52 was a real pioneer in creating a national , very deep university system			1
... the @entity52 was a pioneer in the interstate highway system			1
... we stepped to the plate in the past and made very , very bold investments in the fundamental environment for competitiveness			0
but right now , we ca n't seem to agree on any of these things			0
" or listen to @entity109 , who was instrumental in helping president @entity110 bridge the divides in politics			0
in the @entity113 , he argues that the middle is shrinking in politics			0
in 1992 , he points out , @entity116 found that 43 % of respondents identified themselves as moderates , 37 % as conservatives , and 17 % as liberals			0
in 2009 , conservatives and liberals were each up 4 % and moderates were down by 7 %			0
similarly , a study of national election data by @entity126 found that in 1984 , some 41 % identified themselves at the midpoint of an ideological scale versus 10 % who placed themselves at liberal or conservative extremes			0
by 2005 , the number who identified themselves at the center had dropped to only 28 % , while the number at the endpoints had risen to 23 %			1
we continue to hear that even so , independents have the whip hand in electoral politics and we tend to assume that they are middling in their views , open to argument , and rather homogeneous			0
but even these assumptions seem doubtful			0
@entity72 , for example , highlights a recent @entity148 survey that suggests that nearly half of independents are actually @entity151 ( 21 % ) or @entity152 ( 26 % ) who just shy away from the label , while another 20 % are more populist , skeptical @entity151 ( " @entity154 " ) , 16 % are " disaffected " voters with a highly negative view of government , and 17 % are " disengaged " altogether			1
not exactly a portrait of moderate unity			1
surely there are many sources of the fractures in today 's electorate , just as there are many social scientists more qualified to take a crack at explaining them			1
but one potential contributing factor comes from a fascinating piece in @entity169 by @entity170 , who fears the winnowing out of so - called " middle - tier relationships " for the @entity52 citizen			1
these relationships have long been , as @entity170 puts it , " at the root of @entity52 community life , " and encompass such different - minded acquaintances as " bridge partners , brothers in the @entity179 , fellow members of the @entity181			1
" but these connections have withered in recent years , even as we stay close to those like - minded folks who inhabit our inner circles of friends and family , and are connected on an unprecedented scale by technology and social media to those farther away			0
without these vibrant , heterogeneous " middle - tier " relationships , @entity170 argues , it may simply be much harder to build the sense of public trust and unity that allows people to stand up to big challenges together			0
the good news is that , as with any self - inflicted wound , the power is in our hands to change course			0
and indeed there is a growing sense in the country that people are finally getting tired of this particularly rancid level of divisiveness			0
there is a generation rising -- singled out in a recent @entity214 cover story as " the @entity215 " -- that , led by its young military veterans , is eager to put aside partisan squabbles to get things done			1
the bipartisan group @entity219 recently convened a conference call with @entity222 ceo @entity221 that they reported drew more than 100,000 participants			0
and even in @entity16 itself , @entity224 , a senior @entity152 senator , recently quit his leadership post so he could devote more time to forging consensus and working across the aisle			0
so there is cause for hope			1
in the meantime , it is up to us to continue to hold those in the halls of power accountable for results and not just party orthodoxy , and to expose ourselves to people outside our handpicked inner sanctums , ideas and opinions outside our own ideologies , and even news sources different from our favorites ( unless you 're a regular @entity2 viewer , of course )			0
politics in this country has always been rough - and - tumble , and so it should be			0
but as no less a patriot than former secretary @entity253 reminded us last thursday while accepting the @entity254 at the @entity255 , " the warning given a long time ago by @entity257 still applies : ' either we hang together or we will surely all hang separately			0
" that advice likewise applies as much to our representatives in government as it does to those to whom the founders truly entrusted the reins of power -- us			1
