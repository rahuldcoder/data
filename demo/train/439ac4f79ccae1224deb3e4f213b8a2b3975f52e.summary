a struggling @entity1 youth club could have its fortunes turned around , thanks to a rather unusual gift			2
when an image appeared last month on the website of famous street artist @entity8 , the race was on to find the original			1
the work , showing a couple embracing while checking their cell phones , was tracked down to a wall of the @entity16 youth center in the southwestern city of @entity18			1
hours later , the @entity8 -- believed to be spray - painted on a black piece of wood screwed onto the wall -- had been removed for safekeeping			1
it is currently on display in a city art gallery			0
now , the notoriously elusive graffiti artist has written a letter confirming that the artwork is his and given his blessing for the cash - strapped club to make money from it			1
the painting could fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars , based on sales of past works			0
in a letter addressed to @entity37 of the @entity38 , the artist says that he intended the work to be " a small visual gift for the area -- but apparently a financial one would 've been more useful			0
" " i do n't normally admit to causing criminal damage but seeing as it looks like charges wo n't be brought any time soon you have my blessing to do what is right with the piece			0
" @entity37 said it was hard to believe the club 's stroke of good fortune			0
" it was very surreal , " he said			0
" you dream that it 's going to happen			0
you do n't think it will happen , and when it does , it 's like ' boom ' -- it 's like winning ( on ) a lottery ticket , really			2
it was such a buzz to think , ' hang on a minute , all our troubles are over			0
' " the club has been serving young people in the city since 1894 , he said , but its finances have suffered during the recent economic downturn			1
we were getting to a stage where we could 've run out of money if we did n't do something drastic about it , " he said			0
" @entity78 and behold , a @entity8 comes along , which we never planned			2
it was just one of those things			0
" the artwork will stay in the museum for the moment , he said , but the club plans to auction it so it can help as many young people in @entity18 as possible			1
it will probably set up a trust , @entity37 said , which will be " a legacy to @entity8 , forever and a day " and help keep young people " off the streets and out of trouble			1
" more than 20,000 people have been to see the piece in the @entity97 , he said			0
@entity98 , mayor of @entity18 , said in a statement that the letter was confirmed as authentic and that he believed the city had " done the right thing " in looking after the artwork while displaying it in aid of the boys club			1
he and @entity37 had agreed that if @entity8 was to " send a signal " that the artwork was to benefit the club , he would be more than happy to oblige , the mayor said			1
" @entity37 said he would like it to benefit both the club and other youth projects in @entity18 which would be a brilliant resolution , " he added			2
" thank you @entity8 ! " a company that held an auction of " salvaged " @entity8 street works ( @entity118 ) last month , @entity119 , estimated their values as ranging from $ 170,000 to nearly $ 850,000			1
the artist 's last high - profile project was a month - long street art " residency " in @entity126 in october			2
is it a @entity8 ? @entity129 street art image appears to show spies at work @entity8 bids farewell to @entity126 with balloons bigger than @entity8 : @entity135 street art goes large interactive : @entity8 takes over @entity126			2

the artwork was spray - painted on the wall of the club last month
club *leader* says being given the @entity8 artwork is like winning the lottery
the club will auction it to raise funds to help young people in the city of @entity18
