@entity0 , @entity2 - controlled northern @entity1 it was n't until jihadist militants mounted a relentless siege of @entity6 , a border town within sight of international television cameras , that much of the world realized ethnic @entity11 were an effective fighting force within @entity1			1
but as much of the rest of @entity1 ripped itself apart in a vicious civil war , @entity1 's @entity2 minority spent three years quietly building a series of mini-states in the north of the country			1
they refer to these three enclaves as @entity23			0
until recently , some outside observers saw them as something of a success			0
" they tried to run them as pretty autonomous statelets that were actually rather admirable in some ways			0
they included many different ethnic groups , faith groups , and they tried to be inclusive , " said @entity31 , a senior analyst with the @entity32 , a conflict mediation organization			0
bulletins pasted on walls on the streets of one @entity2 - controlled town urge business owners to post signs in the three official languages of @entity23 : @entity2 , @entity42 , and @entity43 -- an ancient @entity45 language spoken in the @entity46 for nearly 2,000 years			1
" the municipality will help in preparation and translation , " the bulletins printed by the municipality of @entity0			0
" our language is our identity , our history , our existence and our dignity			0
" in some ways , the @entity2 - controlled zone feels a world away from many other battle - scarred towns in northern @entity1			1
these areas have barely been targeted by the @entity1 government airstrikes and barrel bombs that pummel rebel - held cities and towns , killing at least 182 civilians last week alone , according to the @entity68			1
unlike the atmosphere in territory controlled by @entity73 militias , women in @entity23 walk freely on the streets , their hair and faces uncovered			0
and everywhere , there are posters and graffiti celebrating the bravery and martyrdom of @entity2 fighters from the @entity83 , or @entity83			2
" our martyrs do not die			0
they live on in memory ! " a @entity2 commander announced at a memorial ceremony for slain fighters			2
the commander , a woman dressed in green camouflage wearing a pistol on her belt , stood in front of scores of uniformed female @entity2 militants who performed military parade drills with @entity98 assault rifles			1
a pillar of the @entity2 movement 's ideology rests on gender equality			1
the fiercely secular @entity83 stands in sharp contrast to its bitter enemy the @entity105 ( @entity105 )			2
in territories it controls , @entity105 militants dramatically reduced freedoms of women and issued public statements justifying the kidnapping and enslavement of thousands of women from the @entity115 religious minority in @entity116			1
" we as women defend and protect our people , " said @entity117 , the female co-president of the largest of the 3 @entity2 enclaves , in an address at the memorial ceremony			2
" we carry weapons to protect our homes and avoid becoming slaves of @entity105 , " she added			2
at the conclusion of the ceremony , female fighters as well as the mothers and widows of @entity83 members killed fighting @entity105 , chanted " @entity132 , " or " @entity133			2
" @entity134 is the nickname of @entity134 , the imprisoned leader of the @entity137 , or @entity137			0
for 30 years , militants from this @entity140 - inspired @entity2 separatist movement fought a guerilla war against the government in nearby @entity143			1
to this day , @entity143 , as well as its @entity145 allies the @entity146 and the @entity147 , officially label the @entity137 a terrorist organization			1
@entity83 leaders insist the @entity137 is a fraternal , though distinctly separate organization			0
the @entity83 's iconography and membership suggest otherwise			0
@entity137 leader @entity134 's portrait sits at the center of many posters of slain @entity83 fighters			0
in addition , during two trips @entity3 journalists made to @entity23 , @entity3 encountered at least a dozen armed @entity2 militants of @entity143 origin			1
in an interview with @entity3 , co-president @entity117 said in her youth she had been a @entity137 fighter , before eventually becoming an activist in a women 's association			0
the @entity11 ' close links to the @entity137 put @entity23 at odds with the @entity2 zone 's neighbor to the north : @entity143			1
that left the enclave of @entity6 vulnerable when @entity105 mounted its assault last month			1
" when push came to shove in @entity6 , the @entity83 fighters were terribly exposed and have been dealt very cruel blows , " said the @entity32 's @entity31			2
more than 200,000 refugees fled across the border to @entity143 to escape the @entity105 advance			1
meanwhile , @entity6 's @entity2 defenders were pushed back almost to the border fence with @entity143 in their grim struggle against the jihadi offensive			1
@entity146 airstrikes , and a series of weapons and ammunition air drops , succeeded in loosening the @entity105 siege			1
but the @entity146 move to help the @entity11 strained relations with @entity143 , whose president called the @entity146 aid drops " a mistake			1
" while the @entity1 @entity11 have become a point of tension between two @entity145 allies , they are also enjoying soaring popularity among @entity11 scattered across different countries in the @entity46			1
last august , @entity83 fighters mounted a daring rescue operation across the border into neighboring @entity116			0
they evacuated thousands of of @entity202 from the @entity115 religious group , who were trapped by @entity105 on a barren mountain			2
over the last month , the @entity83 's defense of @entity6 have electrified and united @entity11 often fractured by linguistic and political divisions			1
but the popularity has come at great cost			0
hundreds of @entity83 members have been killed , and many more wounded , in the war against @entity105			1
at the memorial ceremony for fallen fighters last weekend , a widow named @entity213 sat with her daughter and son watching the speeches			0
she was in the final month of her pregnancy with her daughter @entity220 last year , when her husband @entity221 was killed in a battle with @entity105			2
@entity213 said her husband 's body had been mutilated when it was recovered , with one of his ears severed			0
" i am angry and sad about what happened to him , but i 'm still proud because he was a fighter , " @entity213 said			0
" if i did n't have these children , i myself would go and fight			0
because this is a just war			0
" not far away , her 3 - and - a - half - year old son @entity233 played next to rows of female fighters who sat on the parade ground clutching their rifles			0
the boy was dressed in the green camouflage uniform of a future @entity2 fighter			2
@entity105 prisoners reveal life inside terror group			2

@entity1 @entity11 have become a point of tension between @entity145 allies @entity143 and the @entity146
the @entity146 has aided @entity2 defenders holding off @entity105 in @entity6
but for 30 years , militants from the @entity2 separatist movement fought a guerilla war
their *opponent* in that fight has been the government in nearby @entity143 .
