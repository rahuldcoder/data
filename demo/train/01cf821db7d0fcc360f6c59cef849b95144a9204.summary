sorry , no @entity1 researchers allowed ! oh wait , seems like that was a misunderstanding			1
@entity6 's management apparently misinterpreted a security law when it barred @entity1 researchers from attending the space agency 's @entity9 in november , @entity1 's state - run @entity4 news agency reported sunday			1
@entity4 said @entity6 sent a letter to @entity1 scientists inviting them back and cited excerpts from the letter			1
@entity6 did not immediately respond to a request for comment early sunday morning			0
the confusion apparently stemmed from a @entity19 law passed in 2011 that prevents @entity6 funds from being used to collaborate with @entity1 or to host @entity1 visitors at its facilities			1
@entity6 had announced that @entity1 nationals would not be allowed to attend the conference for @entity6 's kepler space telescope program at the @entity26 due to national security			1
the space telescope has been searching for planets outside of our solar system			0
earlier this month , @entity1 slammed @entity6 for its decision to ban @entity1 scholars from the conference , calling it " discriminatory			1
" @entity34 , an official with the @entity35 of the @entity1 @entity37 's @entity36 , said the ban was similar to previous @entity19 action against the @entity40 during the @entity41			1
he said it also illustrated @entity19 fear of @entity1 's fast development			1
@entity6 did n't release an official statement on its website due to the @entity19 government 's partial shutdown earlier this month			1
but some @entity19 scientists joined in decrying the decision and called for a boycott of the conference			0
" in good conscience , i can not attend a meeting that discriminates in this way			0
the meeting is about planets located trillions of miles away , with no national security implications , " @entity57 , an astronomy professor at the @entity58 , wrote in an e-mail to the organizers			0
' inaccuracies ' @entity19 @entity66 rep. @entity66 , who drafted the 2011 law , issued a statement on his website that sought to correct " inaccuracies " about the restrictions first reported by @entity74 's @entity73 newspaper			2
" i was concerned to read an october 4 article in @entity73 that reported on poor guidance about these policies with regard to restrictions on @entity1 nationals attending a conference next month at @entity26			0
unfortunately , the article is riddled with inaccuracies , as is , it appears , the guidance provided by @entity26 staff to the attendees , " @entity66 wrote			0
" as you know , the congressional provision -- which has been in place since early 2011 -- primarily restricts bilateral , not multilateral , meetings and activities with the communist @entity1 government or @entity1 - owned companies			0
it places no restrictions on activities involving individual @entity1 nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the @entity1 government			0
" security fears @entity66 said @entity6 officials may have believed the decision was needed because of extra temporary restrictions on foreign nationals after a potential security breach by a @entity1 citizen at a @entity6 facility earlier this year			2
in march this year , a @entity1 aerospace contractor who worked for @entity6 was arrested at @entity110 's @entity109 as he boarded a flight to @entity112			2
@entity113 , who worked at @entity6 's @entity114 's @entity26 in @entity115 , @entity116 , was charged with making false statements to @entity19 authorities by failing to disclose all of the electronic devices he was carrying on his one - way flight			2
@entity66 , who oversees congressional funding of several agencies , told reporters in march he believed @entity113 was spying and had access to highly sensitive documents , including source codes for high - tech imaging used in missiles , unmanned aerospace equipment and other technology desired by the @entity1 government .			0

@entity6 had barred from @entity1 researchers from next month 's @entity9 science conference
@entity4 : @entity6 management apparently misinterpreted a 2011 @entity19 security law
the law prevents @entity6 funds from being used to collaborate with @entity1
