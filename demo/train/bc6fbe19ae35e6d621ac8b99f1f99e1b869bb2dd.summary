@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 has been an awe - inspiring event -- with daily doses of drama , guts and glory -- but its zenith was always going to be the showdown of the gladiators of pace that is the men 's 100 meters final			1
of all @entity17 disciplines there are none as original , pure and spectacular as this hallowed contest			1
original : because the first 13 ancient games consisted only of the " stadion " discipline , the short - distance sprint race that ran the length of the stadium in @entity26			1
pure : because every person on the planet , barring disability , can relate to running as fast as their legs will carry them ; everyone knows in some way their own limits in this capacity and , consequently , respecting the audacity of the world 's finest and fastest athletes over the distance is an easy connection to make			1
spectacular : because there is no moment in the sporting world that has such intensity of drama			2
bolt sprints to @entity17 gold the superhuman nature of its combatants connects with the human psyche in a primal and magnetic way , and has transfixed populations from ancient times to modern			2
thousands of lucky souls in attendance at @entity1 's packed - to - the - rafters @entity0 were witness to the latest chapter of this thousand - year narrative and in @entity66 witnessed arguably its greatest character add to his legend			1
another two billion were estimated to be watching the feat live on television screens worldwide			0
hindsight would always see the hero prevail , but much was in doubt ahead of the race			0
true , @entity66 was the reigning @entity17 champion of 2008 , but the 25 - year - old 's aura of invincibility had taken major blows since he shattered the world record in @entity82 in 2009			1
concerns pervaded over @entity66 's form and fitness ; worries that escalated when he lost to his training partner and rival @entity88 in @entity90 's trials barely a month before the @entity21			1
@entity17 blog : day 9 action as it happened there was a scrutiny associated with @entity66 's every move that no other athlete had to contend with either			1
relentless interviews followed endless commercial commitments			0
his actions may still have conveyed a man who was carefree and confident , but this was a young man who was well versed with the energy - sapping rigors of celebrity on a grand scale			0
but the task of the champion is to overcome			0
the first indications of the marvel that was to happen came in the semifinal heats , where @entity66 cruised to victory by covering the yardage in little over 10 seconds and seemingly without breaking from second gear			1
there was a nonchalant swagger to the way qualification was assured			0
ahead of the final itself there was no one cooler than the 1.96 meter tall @entity90			1
while 80,000 people collectively fidgeted , fretted and fussed in anticipation of the main event , @entity66 remained immune to the pressure			2
he jested as the myriad of tv cameras honed on his expressions , gesticulating how fast he would run with two rapidly moving index and middle fingers			0
he shrugged and he smiled			0
the runners were called to their marks , forming a line of the fleet - footed finest			0
many champions in their own right : gay , @entity137 and @entity138 from @entity139 ; @entity88 , @entity140 and @entity141 from the @entity142			0
the pilgrims of the @entity144 were called on to endure a claustrophobic wait by large video screens that said : " quiet please			0
" " set ! ... " a lone helicopter broke the noiseless air , hovering miles in the distance			0
@entity152 ! eight heads rose in a line on the track as a wave of sound and flash photography exploded around the stadium before crashing on to the most scrutinized piece of land on the planet like a tsunami			0
@entity66 's reaction time was typically slow , with @entity137 , @entity88 and @entity165 faster out of the blocks , but the legs in lane seven were starting to drive			2
at 20 meters the head was up and the long stride was reeling in the lost ground ; by 50 , @entity66 had drawn level , arms now pumping like pistons , torso bucking in time			2
the line of sprinters in alternate lanes of red and yellow ( @entity139 in red , @entity90 in yellow ) squeezed every sinew to keep up with the new pacemaker			2
@entity66 relaxed , elongated his stride and left the rest in his wake			2
when he crossed the line after 9.63 seconds he was a good meter ahead of the field			1
the time -- the second fastest in history -- was a new @entity17 record and @entity66 had achieved what only @entity193 had before : to have won gold medals twice in the event			1
he had beaten three other athletes who ran under 9.8 seconds ( 9.85 was the world record up until 2008 ) , making it the fastest 100m podium of all time			1
@entity66 : the man whose name sounds preordained by the @entity204 , a real - life superman , the greatest sprint showman that ever lived , the world - record holder and the newly crowned double @entity17 champion			1
the king still reigns , and he 'll be running the 200m in a few days time ...			0

reigning @entity17 champion @entity66 confirms his position as world 's fastest man
