-- @entity1 will surrender his world no. 1 ranking to @entity3 after the 17 - time major winner confirmed he is pulling out of the @entity5 through injury			1
@entity1 endured a painful defeat to @entity8 at the @entity10 tournament in @entity11 on sunday , a match that lasted a grueling two hours and 45 minutes			1
and after his marathon match , he confirmed he would skip the @entity5 in order to focus on the season - ending @entity15 in @entity16 that start in early november			1
that decision means he will lose the rankings points he accrued from three tournaments last year , and will be unable to overhaul @entity3 even if he wins his third straight @entity15 crown			2
" it 's just too much , " @entity1 was quoted as saying on the official @entity5 website after defeat in his home town			1
" i was trying to make up my mind and i had some niggles i did n't want to take a chance on			0
i do n't want to take a chance for @entity16			0
" i feel very disappointed as i had one of the best weeks of my life there last year , but this is just a last - minute decision			0
" @entity3 enjoyed a 53 - week stay at the top of the rankings after his record - breaking 2011 until @entity1 regained top spot after taking his seventh @entity38 title back in july			1
but @entity3 will now end the year as world no. 1 for a second successive year , the first time that has happened since @entity1 held it between 2004 and 2007			1
with @entity43 out for the rest of the year with a knee injury , @entity42 is the major threat to the dominance of @entity1 and @entity3 and the @entity48 says he is raring to go after missing the @entity11 tournament			1
" i had a full week of rest after @entity53 which i needed , " @entity42 told the tournament 's official website			2
" i 've had a pretty decent preparation for the tournament , which is good			2
" @entity42 is one of the strong favorites for the @entity58 title , and he is gearing up for a big end to his breakthrough year in which he took his first ever grand slam victory and an olympic gold medal to boot			2
" it does n't make sense to come and save energy , " added the @entity64 champion			0
" having a full week of rest at this stage of the season ( is something that ) in the past i had n't really had , so i feel so much fresher coming into @entity58 than i had done the last few years			0
" i 'll try to play my best this week and then see what happens in @entity16			0
i feel better at this stage of the year compared with last year			0
" @entity42 will begin his @entity58 campaign on wednesday against either @entity79 wild - card @entity77 or @entity82 qualifier @entity80 .			0
