-- can the " birthers " ever be convinced that @entity1 was born in @entity2 and is eligible to serve as president ? probably not , according to one prominent psychology professor and other political observers			1
since @entity1 launched his bid for the @entity9 , a sizable minority of @entity2 has expressed strong doubts about whether he was actually born in the @entity2			1
over the past few years , the allegation that he was born overseas -- in @entity13 or perhaps @entity14 -- has taken on a life of its own , despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary			2
a recent @entity20 poll showed that roughly 25 % of @entity2 -- including over four in 10 @entity21 -- believe @entity1 was definitely or probably not born in the @entity2			1
earlier this week , @entity0 released the results of its own investigation into the controversy			0
documents and statements from numerous public officials and childhood friends made clear that the president was born in @entity30 on august 4 , 1961			1
on wednesday , @entity1 himself addressed the issue , pleading for an end to the distractions of " sideshows " and " carnival barkers			2
" the president yielded to demands from his critics that he release his original long - form birth certificate , filing a special legal request with @entity30 authorities to release a document that is no longer used for official purposes and ordinarily remains buried in the basement archives of the state health department			1
@entity1 's 2008 release of the more common " live birth certification " -- a short computer - generated form typically used for documentation purposes -- did little to silence the chorus of skeptics			1
it remains to be seen whether wednesday 's release will be received any differently			2
but the early reaction was n't exactly positive			0
one of the main websites pushing the birther claims -- birthers.org -- declared that " forgery or not , now we can debate the true meaning of a natural born citizen			0
" the @entity2 @entity62 says only " natural born " citizens can become president -- a vague clause that some members of the birther movement contend disqualifies @entity1 if he was born outside the @entity2			1
@entity68 , editor - in - chief of the conservative website @entity70 , said that " we know ( @entity1 's ) father was a @entity13 citizen , and that he would therefore confer @entity13 or @entity73 citizenship on his son , which would at best make him a dual citizen			1
" dual citizenship , @entity83 asserted , " is not what the @entity77 had in mind when they coined the phrase ' natural born citizen			0
' " @entity84 , the legislative director for a @entity86 state representative backing a bill requiring proof of citizenship for presidential ballot access , told the website @entity92 that she was still suspicious			0
" what they produced today ... still says certificate of live birth across the top , " she said			0
" we want to see a ' birth certificate			0
' ... the one that we have that says ' birth certificate ' is from @entity103 , @entity13 , with his footprint on it			0
he has still not produced an @entity2 birth certificate			2
" why the unrelenting skepticism ? @entity111 's @entity110 , author of the " @entity112 " and an informal advisor to @entity1 's 2008 campaign , chalked up much of it to @entity1 's reluctance to immediately rebut the charge more quickly in the presidential race			1
" the right wing was attempting to make him ' one of them ' as opposed to ' one of us , ' " he claimed			0
@entity110 , a professor of psychology and psychiatry , cited what psychologists call the " sleeper effect			2
" " if you present negative information about someone and it initially goes unchallenged , you might alter some people 's conscious beliefs by challenging it later , " he asserted			2
" but they are left with a negative gut - level feeling that does n't go away			0
" " political feelings , once they are strongly held , tend to be resistant to facts			0
it 's just the result of the way our brains work , " he said			0
@entity110 mentioned the so - called " @entity150 " attacks against @entity145 presidential nominee @entity144 in 2004 , which called into question the senator 's service in @entity149			1
@entity144 " allowed his honor to be challenged and did n't respond for weeks , " @entity110 said			1
" when finally he did respond and had definitive evidence that the attacks were untrue , it was too late			0
people 's feelings towards him had already changed			2
they would n't change back by that point			0
" along similar lines , @entity110 told @entity0 that if staunch @entity145 or @entity21 are presented with clear evidence of wrongdoing on the part of their party 's nominee shortly before an election , they 'll come up with " every kind of rationalization to explain it away			1
" " we fight off information that makes us feel bad and gravitate toward information that makes us comfortable , " he said			0
@entity110 also brought up the explosive issue of race , one of the biggest political lightning rods in @entity2 history			1
he insisted the birther movement never would have taken hold with a white president			0
it 's not fair to call a large segment of today 's electorate " 1950s - style racists , " he said			2
but some people are " unconsciously prejudiced in a way that predisposes them to not believing that a black man with a funny name could have really been legitimately elected president of the @entity2			1
" but @entity189 , a @entity190 political scientist , took issue with the notion of race as the critical component of the birther movement			1
" the fact that @entity1 is black may affect the form of the conspiracy , but probably not the fact that there is a following for this rumor , " he told @entity0			1
" conspiracy beliefs have a long history in @entity2 politics			1
" @entity189 cited a range of political conspiracy theories , including claims regarding the @entity209 assassination , involvement on the part of the @entity212 in alleged murders , and @entity215 's supposed knowledge of the 9/11 terror attacks			1
presidential historian @entity217 noted that , back in the 19th century , questions were raised over the @entity2 roots of @entity220 and @entity221			2
but it was " nothing like this , " he told @entity0			0
" we are now in the age of electronic journalism			0
... this has become a ghastly scenario ( over ) the last month			0
" @entity189 suggested that @entity1 's release of the long - form birth certificate will " further marginalize those who insist ( the matter of his birth ) is an open question			1
" still , he added , " i do n't understand why the @entity9 took so long " to put out the document			2
just how long will the controversy drag on ? @entity110 claimed the birther issue will continue to be political fodder until a critical mass of @entity21 leaders decide it 's making the @entity21 look " foolish " and hurting the party among independent voters			1
a spokesman for @entity9 speaker @entity246 , @entity247 , released a statement wednesday claiming that the controversy " has long been a settled issue			0
@entity0 's @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report			0

a significant portion of the electorate continues to believe @entity1 was n't born in @entity2
there is *overwhelming* evidence that @entity1 was born in @entity30 in 1961
@entity111 's @entity110 says race is a key factor , and that people often block out facts they *dislike*
@entity190 's @entity189 notes the long history of conspiracy theories in @entity2 politics
