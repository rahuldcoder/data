the @entity1 - led @entity0 on thursday voted to form a select committee to investigate the deadly @entity4 terror attack , elevating its oversight of an issue that has become a partisan flashpoint			1
@entity4 -- government cover - up or right - wing conspiracy theory ? a nearly party line vote of 232 - 186 established the panel despite investigations by multiple @entity0 committees that have reviewed documents , interviewed witnesses and held numerous hearings			1
the september 2012 armed assault on the @entity19 diplomatic compound in eastern @entity20 killed four @entity19 , including ambassador @entity21			0
democrats were still deciding whether to participate in the committee , arguing its creation was a political ploy to keep the controversy in play during a midterm election year			0
more will be known about that as early as friday			0
house speaker @entity30 said new questions about the @entity34 administration 's handling of the matter now required the @entity0 " to respond as one institution " to arrive at the truth			1
but @entity39 @entity38 said @entity1 have exploited the tragedy , adding that the " nation deserves better than yet another deeply partisan and political review			2
" @entity43 : no reason for new @entity4 committee @entity30 said the committee would have robust authority and its investigation " will not be a partisan process			1
" new information released last week the @entity34 administration has come under fire over questions about the level of security before the armed assault , its reaction to it , and its slow - to - evolve public response			0
in moving ahead with the committee , @entity30 said that " a line was crossed in two places			1
" first , he said documents unearthed by a conservative watchdog that surfaced last week raised questions about the administration 's explanation of events after the attack			0
he also said the administration defied a congressional subpoena to turn over information			0
there has been intense controversy over early statements linking the attack to a spontaneous protest over an @entity78 film produced in the @entity19 that had sparked demonstrations elsewhere at the time			0
but it was soon revealed that it was a coordinated terror attack			0
@entity1 allege the administration politicized its response in a presidential election year			2
the @entity0 has said the new information cited by @entity30 was broad - based and not specifically related to @entity4			1
will @entity87 participate ? the question now centers on whether @entity87 will sign on			2
as of now , they would get five of the 12 seats			0
but @entity87 want more equity			2
those issues center on membership as well as subpoenas and the questioning of witnesses			0
@entity97 : the biggest mistake @entity87 could make on @entity4 @entity0 @entity1 are unlikely to bend to @entity87 demands on the details of the committee , a @entity1 source familiar with the matter told @entity104			1
but when pressed about whether @entity1 would make changes to give @entity87 more power in the investigation , @entity30 would only say that " there are further conversations continuing on that issue			1
" those talks were said to be intense			0
in addition to a possible boycott , @entity104 has learned that @entity87 also are discussing another option -- minimal participation -- something short of an all - out boycott and less than the full contingent of @entity87			1
according to a @entity87 leadership aide , this option would " make clear they 're protesting , but also have full member participation to ensure that there are @entity87 in the room to hold @entity1 accountable for their behavior on the committee			1
meeting on strategy on thursday , many @entity0 @entity87 attended a weekly meeting to go over strategy for floor action on the issue			1
but @entity38 and other top @entity87 were still weighing the pros and cons from their rank and file on the issue of participation			2
one aide told @entity104 that @entity87 recognized they were unlikely to get changes they outlined in a letter to @entity30			1
but the aide said that " the calculus on this is being weighed -- do we participate in a @entity145 - like committee or worse , or is it worth having someone in the room for it ? " @entity145 is chairman of the @entity150 , which has taken a leading role in the @entity1 - led investigation of @entity4			1
his effort has been sharply criticized by @entity87			1
rep. @entity154 , who heads the @entity155 , which is in charge of electing democrats to the @entity0 this november , is arguing privately it would be a mistake to participate			0
he cited numerous reasons , including fear that independent voters fed up with @entity164 bickering would see democrats as part of the problem			0
fundraising off @entity4 separately , the controversy grew more intense this week over revelations that @entity1 were using it for political fund - raising			1
@entity87 contend that just underscores their belief that the select committee was politically driven			2
@entity30 punted on the fund - raising question on thursday , refusing to endorse or dismiss it			2
despite multiple questions about whether it is right for @entity1 to use the tragedy to raise political cash , all @entity30 would say repeatedly is " our focus is on getting the truth for the @entity19 people and these four families			1
" @entity30 already appointed @entity186 rep. @entity185 , a former prosecutor , to head the select committee			2
he said he would release the names of other @entity1 members in the near future			0
a @entity1 aide told @entity104 he expected the names to be released on friday			0
opinion : a guide to @entity1 's @entity4 obsession			0

@entity0 votes almost entirely on party lines to establish the panel
@entity87 want the @entity1 - led panel to be evenly split with *republicans*
but @entity0 speaker @entity30 says the current plan for a 7 - 5 division was fair
@entity30 also said forming the committee was a serious effort to get at the truth
