-- while many teenagers will be focusing on opening presents and eating turkey , this christmas day @entity1 will be poring over weather maps			2
after circumnavigating the globe by herself at the age of just 16 , it would be easy to presume that a 628 - nautical - mile race would not faze the sailor			1
but the @entity13 teen is not taking any chances when she enters the @entity15 to @entity16 , beginning on december 26			1
now aged 18 , @entity1 will skipper the youngest - ever crew in the ocean race			1
" we 've ticked all the boxes " , says @entity1			0
" this last week is all about keeping your cool			0
" @entity1 became the youngest person ever to sail around the world non-stop and unassisted last year			1
her 23,000 - nautical - mile journey came to an end in @entity27 amid much fanfare			1
thousands of people lined the foreshore to greet her , leisure boats sailed through the heads alongside her and she was officially welcomed home by the then prime minister @entity35			0
@entity36 : making the most of @entity13 's ' harbor city ' it is in the same harbor where the celebrations took place that the @entity15 @entity36 to @entity16 will start next week			1
@entity1 will skipper " @entity43 , " one of 89 boats in the fleet this year			1
" @entity46 is all about slow and steady and keeping your head together for the 200 - plus days , " says @entity1			2
this race provides a completely different challenge of leading a team , where the average age is only 19			1
with all competitors required to be aged 18 and over , @entity1 only just qualifies			1
" we learned a lot in the practice run -- it 's all about communicating			0
when the communication goes well , we sail really well , " she says			0
the crew of 10 -- four women and six men -- comes from both sides of the globe , with its members a mix of the best young talent from @entity13 and @entity66			2
despite their age @entity1 insists they have the experience , with two already having competed in the event previously			2
some of the crew come from racing backgrounds and the skipper says others have clocked up a huge amount of offshore miles in their relatively short lives			0
but @entity1 is under no illusion about how challenging the race can be			2
the course takes the fleet down the south - east coast of @entity13 and across the treacherous @entity84			1
the conditions are notoriously demanding			0
in 1998 six crew lost their lives at sea when rough weather hit			0
" our number - one goal is to finish the race , " @entity1 says			1
the sailor is well aware of the race 's reputation of being tough			0
" you train for these sorts of things , " she adds			0
" we 've done endless amounts of overboard drills			0
" @entity101 : conquering the ' @entity102 ' @entity1 and her crew have been in intensive training for the race since october			2
for six days a week they have combined fitness work with on - the - water training			0
@entity1 says sailing down to @entity16 and back last month gave them the confidence they need going into the race			1
" we had quite a lot of tough conditions , which we wanted , and everyone held up well			0
" all eyes will be on the record - holding supermaxi " @entity120 , " vying for her sixth title , to take line honors			0
however , @entity1 's presence ensures " @entity43 " will also be one of the yachts that will be closely monitored by the sporting world as she heads down the coast			1
the young crew will be competing in the @entity36 38 class , and while their main aim is to finish the event , they are well aware that it is a race			2
" it 's tough but we are hoping to be as competitive as possible , we 've put the hard yards in , " says @entity1			2
the final touches of their preparations will be made on sunday , @entity138 , when @entity1 and her crew will join the competitors for the traditional barbeque lunch at the yacht club			0
it may not be a normal @entity138 for the average teenager , but for someone who has spent most of her 18 years on the water , @entity1 gives the impression she would n't have it any other way .			1
