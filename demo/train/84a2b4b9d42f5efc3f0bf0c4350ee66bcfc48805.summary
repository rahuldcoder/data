the ability for tag - team action			1
the latest version in the iconic series from @entity11 and @entity12 returns to the game 's roots with fast action , brutal results and a story mode that takes players back to the first three " @entity8 " games in an effort to change the future			1
fatalities make a return , as well as a new move called x-ray			0
the controls are deceptively simple			0
each button on the controller works a particular body part -- one button for left arm , one button for right leg , and so on			0
using the d - pad or an analog stick in conjunction with the button makes the character perform more complicated maneuvers			1
and , as in the past , stringing together a series of buttons and stick movements creates highly specialized and devastating attacks			0
however , the game can work just as well with basic moves , for beginners , as it does with more detailed ones , for experienced players			1
while the characters and background stories are rendered in three dimensions , fights take place on a two - dimensional plane			1
the details in the movements and battle effects are highly rendered and , in the sprit of the franchise 's past , graphic			1
nowhere is this more evident than in the new x-ray attack			0
a bar at the bottom of the screen fills up as moves are used			1
once completely full , the x-ray move can be used			0
cinematics are shown as a character performs a devastating series of attacks that demonstrate in gory and specific detail what bones are being broken or which internal organs are being destroyed			0
the imagery is gruesome and groan - worthy , but it wo n't let you avert your eyes , and fatalities are also more detailed and violent than in past versions			1
so these moves are not for the faint of heart or stomach			1
more than once during my game play , others watching moaned or yelled " gross ! " ( which , it must be said , made me want to perform those actions again and again )			0
there are also fatality moves that use the surrounding environment 's scenery to deadly effect			1
fan - favorite characters are back , including @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			1
other playable , never - before - seen characters get unlocked during game play			1
the single - player story is cheesy , but it gets you into the action quickly and requires you to use a variety of characters			1
at each stage , the player controls a different avatar through a series of fights to advance to the next stage			1
combat difficulty ramps up as you advance , but during some battles , the difficulty seems to be extraordinarily high			0
specific tactics seem to be needed to get through those particular fights -- for example , counterpunching only or flying attacks only			0
in the story , lord @entity120 sends a message back in time to himself to prevent @entity124 's ultimate victory ( the story told in " @entity126 " )			1
it plays out like ... well ... a movie , but offers an excuse for the ensuing battles and tournaments to take place			2
single - player action is expected to last more than eight hours			1
it took me about 10 hours to complete , including the climactic boss battle , which ended up being fairly easy once i figured out a particular series of moves to win			2
other modes of play offer fight training , skill tests and tutorials that allow you to practice fatality moves over and over			2
the @entity146 consists of fights and mini-games that test your skills and hone your moves			2
there are also special modes that randomly change the fight rules , hand out rewards for breaking items , check your eyesight with a hidden ball game and test timing with a fast - strike game			2
with 300 different challenges , this mode will keep you busy for quite some time			2
the new @entity164 feature lets up to 4 gamers play in a tournament or single competition			2
the tag element allows for combo attacks in which one character can set up a devastating finale with the other			0
once that sequence begins , the opponent offers no resistance , so there is no pressure , which allows players the time to perfect the awesome maneuver			1
plus , it is just fun to see how combatants are dismembered			0
there are also battle modes for online action , including ladder challenges and tournaments			2
sadly , because of the @entity189 outage , i was unable to check those out			0
" @entity8 " is a triumphant return to the roots of the classic fighting game			0
despite story line dialog that is more in line with a b - movie , the single - player action does move along at a brisk pace and offers great variety in characters and action			1
if you 've never played a " @entity8 " game before , this is a good way to get a handle on the characters			2
but if you are a longtime fan of the series , you will be impressed with the improved graphics , original content and battle challenges			0
it is a worthy addition to the series			0
" @entity8 " is available now for the @entity214 and the @entity215			0
it is rated m for mature because of blood and gore , intense violence , partial nudity and strong language			0
the @entity214 version also contains @entity222 from the " @entity225 " series as a playable character , and the game can also be played in stereoscopic 3 - @entity227			0

from @entity11 and @entity12
lord @entity120 sends a message back in time to himself to prevent @entity124 's ultimate victory
the single - player action moves at a brisk pace and offers great variety in characters
