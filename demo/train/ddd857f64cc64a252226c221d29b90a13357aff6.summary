-- in the posters for " @entity3 , " @entity1 has been given the stylized bod of a comic - book sci - action vamp , and her features are as coolly chiseled as her physique			1
but in the movie version of @entity11 's 2011 novel , @entity1 , i 'm glad to say , is a lot more recognizably human , and that goes for her acting too			1
her character , @entity15 , spends most of the film learning to leap and toss knives and risk death like a badass , and when she puts those skills to the test battling her society 's corrupt leaders , there 's no doubt that she 's a superior , market - tested @entity26 role model , like @entity27 in " @entity28			1
" but she is also , as @entity1 plays her , an intensely vulnerable and relatable character			1
@entity15 , @entity31 , has been raised as a member of @entity33 , one of five factions in a walled dystopia that was formerly @entity36 and still looks , strikingly , like a semiruined concrete - playground version of that city			2
the members of @entity41 dress in plain gray frocks , like the @entity43 , and they 're all about puritan self - sacrifice			2
the other four factions are @entity46 ( defined by their transcendent knowledge ) , @entity48 ( who are compulsively honest ) , @entity50 ( the naturally peaceful ) , and @entity51 ( the fearless tattooed warrior jocks in black â € ” in other words , the sect that anyone cool would want to be part of )			2
@entity31 and her peers have the right to choose a - faction for themselves ( it 's like picking a college â € ” you can go to @entity64 even if your folks did n't )			0
but when she takes the test to learn which faction she 's best suited for , it turns out that she 's in the rare forbidden - category known as @entity3 , which means she has the qualities of three factions at once : @entity73 , - @entity46 , and @entity51			0
it may sound silly to say she 's an outlaw because she 's self - sacrificial , brilliant , and strong all at the same time , but what 's really forbidden is - independent thought			0
@entity1 , through the delicate power of her acting , does something compelling : she shows you what a prickly , fearful , yet daring personality looks like when it 's nestled deep within the kind of modest , bookish girl who should n't even like gym class			1
@entity15 chooses to become part of @entity51 not because she has any special athletic skill but because it 's her nature to go for broke			0
the first half of " divergent " is a lean , exciting basic - training thriller , with @entity15 willing herself to do things like jump aboard speeding trains and fight with her bare knuckles			0
@entity1 , at every turn , lets us feel as if we 're in her shoes , not so much @entity51 as thrillingly daunted			1
the second half of the movie goes on a bit , with too many rote combat scenes			0
yet the director , @entity105 ( the fanciful craftsman who made " @entity106 " and " @entity107 " ) , keeps you invested , staging a rise - of - the - savior - heroine plot so that it seems less ritualistic than it does in the @entity28 films			0
it helps that the drill sergeant , named four , is played by @entity113 , who 's like an unflaky @entity115 with a surly hint of t - shirt - era @entity117 ; he brings off the neat trick of playing a hardass who is also a heartthrob			0
and it 's nice to watch @entity123 go full ice - blood fascist as the @entity46 leader who makes a scarily smart case for a society rooted in the fine art of - control			0
in many ways , she sounds similar to a movie executive , so i 'm glad to see the launch of a dystopian franchise in which individuality , as embodied by @entity1 , looks like it could mean something beyond hiply propping up the status quo			2
