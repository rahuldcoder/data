@entity0 -- to say that @entity2 misses the glory days when huge numbers of visitors flocked to @entity7 's ancient sites is probably an understatement			1
a veteran of the travel industry who now heads the @entity13 , he 's seen his business take hit after hit as the country 's stability unraveled in the wake of the 2011 @entity18			2
" i have six cruise ships , " he laments			0
" they are not operating for three years now			2
" better times could soon be around the corner			0
elections this month to choose a new president are seen by many as an opportunity to draw a line under months of turmoil and return to stability			1
the vote is likely , however , to raise fresh concerns over visitor safety and ongoing outbreaks of sometimes deadly violence			2
yet @entity35 is optimistic that , despite the problems , a new marketing campaign will succeed in winning back the visitors he and the rest of the country 's tourism industry so sorely miss. @entity7 's @entity43 launched its " we miss you " message earlier this month , using social media to promote a glossy video that portrays the nation as a luxury destination for big spenders			1
instead of focusing on the country 's famed antiquities , the video features dancers , shopping malls and ritzy hotels			2
campaign 's crucial timing " i expect this campaign to bear fruit by the beginning of august , " @entity35 says			1
the timing and the tone of the " miss you " message is crucial			2
with @entity7 's traditional visitors from @entity68 and @entity69 not expected to return in their previous numbers for years to come , the country is instead turning to wealthy @entity72 from @entity74 nations			1
up to 70 % of @entity7 's tourists have traditionally come from @entity69 , with the @entity74 making up another 20 %			1
the greatest numbers in recent times have come from @entity78 , followed by @entity79 , the @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			2
the hope is that shortfalls in traditional visitors can be made up by encouraging @entity72 , particularly from @entity86 , @entity87 , the @entity88 and @entity89 , to consider @entity0 as a travel destination for this year 's @entity92 holiday			1
the end to the traditional @entity94 fasting month of @entity95 is due to fall on july 28			1
" arabs are definitely high spenders , " says @entity35			0
" in contrast , he says , visitors from @entity78 and the @entity80 , in particular , tend to go on low - cost tours			2
" you do n't have big spenders coming from @entity78 , " he says			0
" some of the @entity72 , they are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in three days			1
" gambling and drinking @entity111 are known for their love of @entity7 nightclubs and casinos , engaging in activities -- gambling and consuming alcohol -- that are forbidden in their home countries			1
@entity119 is the preferred time for these tourists			2
big money is dropped at casinos , in particular , the @entity124 at the five - star @entity125 on central @entity0 's upscale @entity128 island			2
during a recent midday visit to the casino , before the " we miss you " campaign has had a chance to do its work , five middle - aged @entity86 men could be seen at the roulette wheel			1
in a matter of less than half an hour , thousands of dollars were laid out in plastic chips , and lost			0
it 's money that 's desperately needed			2
since the january 2011 revolution that removed president @entity142 , @entity7 's tourism industry has suffered deep losses , estimated at more than $ 2.5 billion on the back of a 32 % drop in visitor numbers			1
the tourism federation says those that do visit the country are making shorter trips , leading to a 43 % drop in hotel occupancy			2
" but the big disaster is the decrease in the average spending , " @entity35 says , pointing out that the average outlays were higher even two decades ago when the @entity156 invasion of @entity86 and subsequent @entity157 was hurting business			0
" it 's down to $ 60 [ a day ] for all tourists			1
if you compare this figure to 1992 , it was $ 135			0
" the tourism ministry says its " we miss you " campaign -- or " @entity171 " in @entity169 -- aims to portray @entity7 as a destination unruffled by upheavals , including the resurgence of violence that followed the 2013 ouster and arrest of former leader @entity178			1
" life has never been interrupted in any of the cities , " says ministry spokeswoman @entity179			0
" @entity7 is still a safe destination , if you know where you are going and what you are doing			1
" despite the ministry 's assurances of safety , calm has not entirely returned to @entity0 , home to some 20 million people			0
travel warnings the @entity192 @entity191 continues to warn travelers that ongoing political and social unrest in major cities has increased the risk of violence , including gun and explosive attacks			0
it warns that women have been targeted in sexual assaults			0
in one incident on may 19 , three policemen were killed and nine others injured when unknown gunmen opened fire near a university			0
the attack took place when security forces confronted students loyal to @entity178 's @entity213 who were protesting against the military - led government in charge since the former leader 's arrest			0
a government spokesman , @entity219 , characterized the latest incident as an attempt to disrupt @entity7 's democratic process			1
he pledged that a crackdown that has seen 16,000 people arrested would " create a peaceful and stable and prosperous future			0
" " there is no place in @entity7 society for those who resort to violence of any kind in an attempt to undermine the state , " he said in a statement			1
one day after the killings , a trickle of foreign tourists could be seen entering @entity0 's @entity238 , home to the treasures of @entity242 's tomb , apparently unaware of the most recent attack			0
@entity244 , 22 , said he had flown in from @entity245 a day earlier and had gotten up at 4:30 am tuesday to begin a two - day visit to @entity7			1
he managed to tour both the @entity248 and @entity249 pyramids before arriving at the @entity238			0
" i really like what there is to see , " he said			0
" at the same time , it 's not an easy travel			1
" the @entity238 is located on the edge of iconic @entity255 , the epicenter of the protests that pushed president @entity142 from office in 2011 , and @entity178 in 2013			0
to reach the museum 's main entrance , @entity244 walked along a side street lined with 24 @entity263 tanks			0
" it 's a little intimidating , but it 's actually a bit reassuring , " he said			0
@entity266 , another @entity192 visiting the museum , is in @entity0 for the summer , interning at a @entity269 agency			0
she has an unusual perspective , having been present in @entity7 during the 2011 revolution and again when @entity178 was removed			1
" i feel completely safe , " said @entity273 , 24 , adding that she felt at ease in @entity0 because her dark looks mean she is sometimes mistaken for an @entity7			1
" i say it all the time , i love @entity7 and i love @entity7			1
this is my favorite place			0
" @entity278 is a journalist based in @entity0 who writes for publications including the @entity280 and the @entity281 .			0
