this weekend , @entity0 appoints 20 new cardinals in @entity3 ( five of them are nonvoting cardinals )			1
as one commentator notes , it is not a question of right versus left , but of north versus south : most of these new cardinals hail from far - flung locations including @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			1
they are a far cry from the usual array of @entity21 and @entity22 cardinals			1
this will , indeed , " change @entity23 forever			2
" @entity23 is a global religion , of course , and it 's changing fast under the leadership of this very bold pontiff			2
the right - versus - left argument has also been in play , dramatically , as this pope has moved quickly to change the way @entity32 think about gays , famously saying " who am i to judge ? " when asked about gays in the church			1
this was one of the first bombshells of his papacy , when he suggested that gays should be " accepted with respect , dignity and compassion , " adding that " every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided			2
" last year , his synod of @entity50 -- a conference of leaders brought together to consider family matters and sexuality -- leaned too far left for many among the bishops , especially in the first draft of their joint statement			0
the @entity0 did n't give up , however , and will try again this coming year , with many fresh voices among his bishops			1
and the chances are that fresh teachings will emerge , as @entity0 clearly wants the church to be more open to gays and friendlier to couples who have been divorced			1
the @entity0 has also addressed the complicated issue of women in the church			1
last year , he declared that women " must have a greater role in the decision - making areas of the church			0
" he has also been sympathetic to the idea of giving women a greater role in the liturgical work of the church , arguing recently for a " more widespread and incisive female presence " in the church			0
indeed , there is good theological ground for this , as the early church had female deacons , and @entity83 put great trust in female leaders , such as @entity86 and @entity87 ( a deacon with whom he entrusted his famous letter to the @entity90 )			0
it was not until quite late in the @entity93 movement that women were relegated to the sidelines , told to sit down and be quiet , and @entity83 's teachings on women in the church remain highly contradictory ( a good summary can be found here , by @entity98 )			0
as with all scriptures , @entity83 's letters need to be read in context			0
one must also take into consideration that not all of @entity83 's letters were by him : most scholars now believe that only seven of his letters were authentic , while the rest were by disciples of @entity83 -- " school of @entity83 , " so to speak			0
and many of these offered comments on women that were incompatible with the original seven letters , as @entity112 ( one of the finest of biblical scholars ) and others have persuasively argued			0
to be frank : it seems to me unlikely that @entity0 will ever allow women into the priesthood , let alone into the @entity124			1
but it also seems inevitable that these things will happen in due course			0
still , the @entity0 revolution is real			1
he has laid the groundwork for profound change , and it matters that he has now appointed a cadre of cardinals from parts of the world where poverty remains an abysmal problem			1
this pope wants the church to be , above all else , a " church for the poor			2
" in the first year of his papacy he wrote a strong @entity141 in which he condemned " the invisible hand of the market " and pushed for economic reforms			0
this eloquent document was so radical , in fact , that even @entity146 stepped into the fray , calling it " pure @entity149			0
" but this pope is n't a @entity152			2
he 's a deeply humble man who believes in social justice			0
he regards @entity154 as someone who identified with those on the margins of society , who declared : " @entity160 are the poor			0
" this pope has consistently sided with those who have no power , and he has been unafraid to state his case , repeatedly , in unequivocal terms			2
the appointment of 20 new cardinals from the margins of the world will only add to his case , reforming the church structurally , from within			1
while not every one of these cardinals shares the pontiff 's views on gays and women in the church , there is no doubt that fresh voices will open the debate on any number of issues			2
this is a revolutionary pope , and his first two years in office have been breathtaking to watch .			1

pope @entity0 will appoint 20 new cardinals in @entity3 on *saturday*
@entity187 : his first two years in office have been breathtaking
