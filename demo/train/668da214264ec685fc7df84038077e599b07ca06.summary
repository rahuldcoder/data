-- @entity1 was more than just the star of countless bedroom wall collages in the late 1960s			1
the @entity5 frontman and token @entity6 who captivated audiences with his talent and charisma was the quintessential teen heartthrob			1
news of @entity1 ' passing ( he died of a heart attack at age 66 wednesday ) prompted nostalgic outbursts from fans , all wanting to reminisce about the @entity16 and 16 magazine covers , the hours logged in front of the tv , and the moments spent bopping around to " @entity21			1
" @entity0 commenter rosemeow wrote : " sad feeling , when pieces of your childhood start falling away			0
there goes another piece of mine			0
" whether the grief stems from the feeling of closing a chapter in one 's own life , or the larger question of mortality , the death of a former teen idol can have a profound effect on fans			0
like @entity41 , who died in 2009 , and @entity42 , who died last month , @entity1 was someone younger generations looked up to as " the first person who made them interested in music , " said @entity47 , @entity48 's senior correspondent			1
for many people , @entity5 were the first group they could claim as their own , as opposed to the music that belonged to their parents , @entity47 added			1
" that really affects people , " he said			2
and then there was @entity1 ' teen heartthrob status			1
" if you talked to any girl who liked @entity5 , invariably , ( @entity1 ) was her favorite , " @entity47 said			1
" it 's the lead singer			0
it 's the cute one			0
the one who 's got the nice personality			0
" but that fandom is n't limited to the girls who would 've gladly traded a limb for a date with @entity1			1
" when i was a kid , i wanted to be @entity1 , " actor @entity67 tweeted			1
" @entity69 part of what led me to showbiz			0
" @entity72 : share your memories of @entity1 a lot of the people who are grieving this loss are in their 40s and 50s , @entity47 said , adding , " it 's a case of , ' wow , he 's one of me			1
' people think of him as , ' he 's from my lifetime			2
' " and though it seems like a far departure , that 's how today 's youths will view pop star @entity89			0
sure , the magazines have changed -- now it 's @entity92 and twist -- and @entity1 ' fitted button - down shirts have been replaced by purple hoodies			1
but the significance of teen idols remains the same			0
( ironically , so does the hair			0
) in 2008 , one year before @entity89 earned his teen heartthrob status , @entity99 named @entity1 the top teen idol of all time , ahead of @entity41 and @entity102 , who shared the honor with @entity104 and @entity105 in the early 1970s			1
taking a page out of @entity5 ' book , @entity89 has taken advantage of this time in the limelight , releasing a memoir , a movie , appearing on " csi : @entity113 , " and touring , all while making music			1
@entity1 guest - starred as himself in a 1971 episode of " @entity118 , " appropriately titled " getting @entity1			2
" the now iconic episode , in which @entity1 performs " girl " for @entity123 at her prom , was beloved by fans			2
" there 's something about @entity5 and what that told us about pop culture and how music and tv and , eventually , film can work together , " @entity47 said			1
" this is sort of a lesson that people can still learn from , and it keeps getting repeated five decades later			2
" the @entity138 -- the group that inspired @entity5 -- released " @entity139 " in 1964			2
three decades later , ' 90s superstars , @entity141 , came out with the movie " @entity143			0
" " the teen idol marketplace is really a two - to five - year window , " @entity47 said , and that was understood back when @entity5 were at their peak			2
but the thing that makes @entity5 different is that their music managed to transcend generations , @entity47 said			1
" oldies radio or commercials or ... on tv shows , ( their music ) kept getting used in the ' 70s and ' 80s , so when they had a comeback , there was an audience for it			0
" after first finding fame in the late ' 80s and mid ' 90s , @entity159 and @entity158 , respectively , experienced a comeback of sorts when they toured together			0
as former fans become parents , and introduce their children to @entity5 , @entity47 said , their audience will grow			2
not to mention that @entity170 's version of " @entity171 " appeared in 2001 's " @entity172			0
" @entity0 commenter papanez wrote : " @entity1 and @entity5 were very special to me			1
i enjoyed them back in the ' 60s , i had a blast introducing my daughter to them when she was little , and i very much enjoyed their reunions			0
" " there will come a day that somebody is going to play @entity141 or * @entity182 for their kids and say , ' let me tell you how great music used to be , ' " @entity47 said			0
" it 's kind of hard for us to fathom , but in the same ways someone says ' @entity21 ' is a great song and , ' they do n't write ( songs ) that way anymore , ' i 'm sure somebody will say that about ' @entity194 ' one day			0
