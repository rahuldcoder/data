@entity0 , @entity1 -- the head of the @entity4 said friday he has found no willingness among leaders of @entity1 ' interim government to return president @entity8 to power			1
@entity4 secretary general @entity10 doubts @entity1 ' new leaders will restore ousted president @entity12			1
" they have , for the moment , no intention of reversing the situation , " secretary general @entity10 told reporters			2
he said he had reached that conclusion after speaking friday with members of the @entity20 , among others			0
@entity10 also rejected assertions by the interim government that the change in leadership was not really a coup d'etat			1
" i do n't know what else you would call it when a group of military take a president out of power and sends him to another country , " he said			1
at the end of @entity10 's comments , deputy foreign minister @entity35 said @entity1 is willing to withdraw from the @entity4			1
" if the @entity4 does n't deem @entity1 worthy of membership of the @entity4 , then @entity1 would renounce , with immediate effect , the @entity41 charter			1
" vice chancellor @entity42 also said @entity1 was ready to leave the @entity4 , which she called a political organization rather than a tribunal of justice			1
" @entity1 will defend its sovereignty , " she said in a televised response			1
@entity8 was ousted in a military - led coup sunday and sent to @entity49 in his pajamas			1
the same day , the @entity51 voted to install @entity52 as interim president			1
that sparked international condemnation , with the @entity4 on tuesday passing a resolution calling for @entity8 's reinstatement by saturday and threatening to suspend @entity1 from the group			1
@entity8 has said he will return this weekend with presidents of other @entity4 member countries , despite @entity52 's vow to have him arrested for violating the country 's constitution if he does so			1
on friday , thousands of people assembled in front of the presidential residence in @entity0 , where @entity52 praised the armed forces for their efforts and offered a different version of events			0
" we must tell the world that there was no coup d'etat here , " he said , his voice hoarse			0
" it was n't a coup ! it was n't a coup ! " he promised that the nation would revert to a democracy , but did not say when			0
" here , in front of @entity1 and the entire world , i guarantee we will have free elections , as soon as we decide when , " he said			1
@entity52 has promised not to run in elections slated for november			0
" you may choose any candidate from any party , " he told the crowd			0
" i want to tell you that i am governing for all political parties			0
i am governing for the poor , for the businessmen , for the rich , for the children and for all the people of @entity1			1
" though the two sides appeared far apart , a compromise might be possible , said @entity101 , an @entity102 expert at the @entity104 , @entity105 - based @entity103			0
" the options are that neither side backs down and that president @entity8 shows up tomorrow and the police are there waiting to arrest him			1
" if @entity8 returns accompanied by international figures , the result would be " awkward , " she said			1
@entity101 added there could be " some kind of compromise , including mutual guarantees			0
" one such scenario -- @entity8 's promise not to pursue legal action against the coup plotters in exchange for their agreement to step aside and not to pursue his cabinet ministers who are in hiding			2
@entity101 praised @entity128 president @entity127 for supporting @entity8 without qualification			1
" by taking the principled stand for democracy that he took in this case in favor of a government that is an ally of @entity136 , he did not let politics intervene			0
this is a change from the previous administration , " she said			0
@entity101 was referring to the tacit @entity128 approval that was given to the coup that in 2002 briefly toppled leftist @entity136 president @entity143 , who has been a consistent @entity128 critic			2
" it helps to recuperate the pro-democracy credential of the @entity128 in this hemisphere , " she said			0
meanwhile , @entity147 accused the new government friday of intimidating media workers			0
" recent reports suggest that journalists who have published news stories on the crisis or covering the issue of protests and scores of detentions have been intimidated , " it said			0
" prosecutors have also reported threats on account of their attempts to verify human rights abuses during protests			0
" at the center of the dispute was a referendum that @entity8 had vowed to carry out last sunday even after the country 's supreme court and congress declared it would be illegal			1
the nonbinding referendum could have opened the door to the creation of a constitutional assembly to modify the country 's charter			2
opponents accused @entity8 of having sought to rewrite the constitution to allow him to run for re-election			2
@entity8 denied that was his intent			2
however , international support for the new government has been virtually nonexistent			0
on thursday , the @entity182 announced that all its ambassadors had left @entity1			2
also thursday , the @entity184 said it was suspending some aid programs to the country			2
earlier , the @entity128 military , which has trained @entity1 forces for years , postponed some planned exercises with the @entity1 military until the situation in the country settles down			1
@entity8 narrowly won the presidency in 2005 with 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for @entity195			2
after 18 years of nearly uninterrupted military rule , @entity1 returned to civilian control in 1981			2
since then , the military has not seemed interested in holding power in the nation of more than 7 million people , about 70 percent of whom live in poverty			0
military interventions were once common in @entity205 , but civilian governments have held sway since the 1980s			0
before sunday , the only other barracks revolt this decade was the unsuccessful 2002 coup attempt against @entity143 , when the military displaced him but backed down days later and allowed his reinstatement			0
@entity2 's @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
