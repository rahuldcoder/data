-- it did n't get a ton of attention monday , but @entity5 's next mobile operating system means significant changes for how @entity8 users send and receive messages			1
if you 're an @entity5 user , this is a big deal			1
messages is the most frequently used app in @entity14 , and is how most users share texts , photos and videos with each other			1
with @entity14 8 , coming this fall , @entity5 is borrowing features from popular messaging platforms like @entity22 and @entity23 while unveiling some new tricks of its own			1
here 's a quick look at the new messaging features announced at @entity5 's @entity27			1
we 'll find out in a few months whether they catch on with users			0
audio and video messages the text window in the next version of @entity35 will contain a little microphone button			1
users hold a finger down on the button , record a short audio or video message , and send it with the swipe of a finger -- all without leaving the app. in this way , @entity5 is taking a page from @entity23 , which also allows audio and video messages			1
@entity47 bought that startup , which has a huge user base overseas , in february for $ 19 billion			0
audio files will appear in your messages stream as jagged lines			2
simply tap on them to listen to the message			0
@entity5 did not say monday whether there will be a limit on the length of the messages			2
self - destructing messages photo and video messages that disappear after a few seconds have been popularized by @entity22 , the mobile messaging app that reportedly spurned multibillion takeover offers from @entity47 and @entity66 last year			1
this ephemeral format has been especially popular with teens and young adults who like to exchange silly or racy messages without fear they 'll be haunted by them later			2
now @entity5 is getting into the game			2
audio and video messages within @entity14 will automatically vanish within a few minutes ( @entity5 did n't say how many ) unless you adjust your settings			1
" you do n't want to have to clean these up			0
audio and video messages can take up space , " said @entity79 , head of @entity81 product marketing			1
" so they 're set to self - destruct unless you choose to keep them			0
" do not disturb sure , group messaging threads among friends can be fun			1
but sometimes all the back - and - forth chatter gets out of hand			0
this feature lets you mute a thread for a while while reserving the option to rejoin the conversation later			0
" if you 've ever been on one of those noisy threads that just keeps buzzing in your pocket ... you can choose when to leave , " said @entity5 senior vice president @entity97 , to applause from the audience			2
@entity103 : nice job , @entity5			2
but i 'm not coming back lock - screen functions if you 're in a hurry , responding to a message on an @entity8 can be a little cumbersome : you have to punch in your passcode and then hit the @entity112 icon just to get started			0
with @entity14 8 , users can listen and respond to audio messages without leaving the lock screen -- just by holding the phone to their ear			1
the phone detects when it 's next to your face , plays the message and lets you record a brief response			0
lower the phone , and the message is sent automatically			0
" it 's super easy , " said @entity79			0
" you can send a message ... just by raising it ( the phone ) to your ear			0
" this feature seems convenient but potentially glitchy if users send accidental messages just by speaking near their phone			1
there was no word from @entity5 on how to avoid this potential problem			0
other stuff if your contacts choose to share them , their locations will pop up in group - messaging threads			1
for the first time , users will be able to add or delete someone in the middle of a group - messaging thread			2
and message attachments -- images and videos , mostly -- will be collected in one place so you do n't have to scroll back through longstanding threads to find them .			0
