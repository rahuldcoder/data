-- @entity1 sits under the blazing sun in the soon - to - be world 's newest capital of @entity5 , a city of red soil , winding dirt roads and scattered tin - roofed homes			1
she watches in delight as children frolic on the streets and women mill about with the new flag of @entity14 wrapped around their shoulders			1
a few feet away , boisterous neighbors spray the rare paved road with a hose , playing with the soapy suds as they hum the new anthem of a nation on the eve of its birth			2
" oh my goodness , i can not believe this day is finally here , " says @entity25 , a resident of @entity26 , @entity27			1
" it is very emotional			2
i 'm excited , but i 'm also thinking of all the people who died for this to happen			2
" @entity25 is among scores who have returned home to witness the birth of @entity14 , as it officially splits from the government based in the north on saturday			1
" the airport is packed and homes are filled with people coming in from all over the world , " @entity25 says			2
" we lost almost everything -- our relatives , our homes , everything we own -- to get to this point			2
there was no way i was missing this			2
" @entity25 says dozens of her relatives died in the violence			2
she fled @entity5 in 1991 as mortars rained from the sky , and has not set foot in her homeland since then			2
" we were at the airport trying to leave when the north started bombing nearby , " she says			1
we all started screaming and hiding			0
" @entity14 's @entity64 north has been in conflict with the majority @entity67 south for decades			1
the civil war created a class of refugees who drifted in and out of neighboring countries -- many on foot -- to flee violence and famine that left about 2 million people dead			0
in january , @entity14 voters overwhelmingly approved a referendum to split , which was part of a 2005 peace deal that helped end the war			1
@entity82 resident @entity81 escaped @entity5 in 1984			0
" i wish my many relatives who died in the civil war were here to witness the separation into a new country , " she says			0
" from here on , i know that they did not die in vain			0
" scores who fled the long conflict are coming home to a region that has not changed much over the years			1
the infrastructure is still lacking -- with about 30 miles of paved roads in all of @entity14 , an area the size of @entity98			1
" it is no @entity27 , " @entity25 says with a chuckle , " but it 's home , and there is a feeling of solace you get at home that you will never get anywhere else			1
" water remains a luxury in most communities and security is still tense , especially in regions bordering the north where violence still rages days before independence			1
but patriotism trumps the challenges , say the returnees , who gathered this week in @entity5 to discuss how they will help move their new country forward			0
@entity120 , who left @entity14 in 1989 , hopes to capitalize on the opportunities in his homeland after he decides what to invest in			1
the 46 - year - old bought a one - way ticket from @entity126 , where he works as a counselor			0
" i left @entity14 because ... we were not wanted by the government in the north , " he says			1
" we have our own country now			0
it is time to come back to invest and help my people			0
" business analysts warn that the minimal infrastructure in @entity14 can lead to a difficult business climate			1
" good business skills will come at a premium and there will be a ferocious demand for talent , " says @entity137 , director of @entity138 , a global firm that works with businesses looking to invest in @entity140			0
the rewards , he says , can include unprecedented business opportunities			0
" returning @entity14 will get an opportunity to shape domestic business ethics and this will ultimately govern the commercial context in which everyone operates , " he says			1
@entity120 says he is not deterred by the flashes of violence that have flared in @entity155 , a border area between the northern and southern regions that remains tense ahead of the independence			0
other challenges such as the disputed region of @entity160 remain , he says , but he is ready to sacrifice for his new homeland			0
" back before i left , i was being attacked in a country that did not want me , " he says			0
" the difference now is i 'll be fighting for @entity14			1
i 'd rather die for my country than watch them suffer			0
" @entity167 will not make it home for the festivities , but the @entity171 resident is planning to move back permanently			2
he has already torn his @entity14 passport in anticipation of a new one from @entity14			1
" having a new country gives me a reason to go back , " the musician says			0
" there is no way i would have gone back to that country if we had not voted for the separation			0
" for now , @entity167 will focus on his upcoming album -- one that includes a song called " 99 %			0
" it 's a reference to the number that voted for the split .			1
