@entity0 , @entity1 -- pope @entity3 visited the main @entity5 synagogue in @entity0 on sunday , a trip that unfolded amid heightened tension between @entity8 and @entity5			1
@entity3 was the first pope in 24 years to visit the @entity10 , or @entity11			1
he called on @entity8 and @entity5 to keep an open dialogue and work together to tackle problems , such as poverty and disease			2
" as @entity19 taught ... and as @entity22 affirms in the @entity23 , all of the commandments are summed up in the love of @entity25 and loving - kindness towards one 's neighbor , " the pope said , according to a @entity18 transcript			0
" this rule urges @entity5 and @entity30 to exercise , in our time , a special generosity towards the poor , towards women and children , strangers , the sick , the weak and the needy			2
" @entity30 and @entity5 " share to a great extent a common spiritual patrimony , " but " often remain unknown to each other , " he said			2
" it is our duty , in response to @entity25 's call , to strive to keep open the space for dialogue , for reciprocal respect , for growth in friendship , for a common witness in the face of challenges of our time , which invite us to cooperate for the good of humanity ... " the visit to @entity0 's synagogue is part of what should be an annual @entity61 , but it did n't happen last year			1
the @entity62 had reinstated an ancient prayer calling for the conversion of the @entity5 , decades after it was shelved as part of 1960s - era reforms			1
@entity1 's @entity5 community pulled out of the @entity68 in protest			1
the @entity62 smoothed feathers by re-wording the prayer			2
but then it revoked the ex-communication of a renegade bishop , @entity74 , who turned out to be a @entity77 denier			0
@entity3 apologized and visited @entity78			0
then he moved @entity77 - era pope @entity79 a step closer to sainthood			1
that rankled the @entity5 community in @entity0 , where @entity84 rounded up @entity5 on pope @entity79 's watch , said @entity87 , the @entity89 's liaison to the @entity62			1
the @entity62 says @entity79 worked behind the scenes to save @entity5 from the holocaust , but it has refused to open archives from his tenure to show proof			1
it also says a papal statement outlining the late pontiff 's heroic virtues was not meant to offend @entity5			0
@entity5 groups have called on the @entity62 to open its archives on @entity100 says scholars eventually will be able to examine the paperwork , but not for several more years because of how long it is taking to catalogue and organize			1
@entity103 , president of the @entity104 , reiterated calls during sunday 's service for the @entity62 to open the archives			1
" the silence of @entity79 still hurts today as an opportunity missed , " he said			0
the pope might not have been able to stop the @entity112 deportation trains , @entity103 said , but he could have conveyed solidarity and comfort simply by speaking out			0
he acknowledged the church 's role in helping save some lives and noted that @entity61 nuns saved his father during @entity120 during his address , @entity3 recalled his 2006 visit to the @entity124 concentration camp			2
" the rulers of the @entity112 wanted to crush the entire @entity5 people , " the pontiff said			0
he said many @entity8 helped @entity5 fugitives whom the @entity84 were " hunting down " for deportation to concentration camps			1
he also said the @entity62 provided help -- " often in a hidden and discreet way			0
" yet the pope acknowledged that others remained indifferent			0
he said the @entity8 has deplored the failings of its adherents , begged forgiveness for actions that " contributed to the scourge of anti-semitism and @entity141 , " and looked forward to warmer relations between @entity8 and @entity5			0
" may these wounds be healed forever , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity144 contributed to this report			0
