after football player @entity2 was caught on video dragging his unconscious fiancee out of an elevator , his attorney called the incident a " very minor physical altercation			1
" where i 'm from , when one combatant in a fight gets knocked out , that is no longer " minor			2
" once the incident made the news , it was inevitable that there would be a " minor " kerfuffle over the story			1
i am not interested in discussing the incident itself			2
what i am interested in discussing is how this incident shows us that when emotional issues are involved , fair debate and discussion get knocked out , too			2
@entity27 commentator @entity26 was nowhere near the elevator that day , but he just got knocked out by a chorus of voices and a spineless employer			1
when @entity26 commented on the issue , he clearly stated his position that @entity2 was dead wrong and deserved punishment			1
without excusing it , @entity26 gave his opinion that , in general , when there is violence , sometimes it might be worth asking questions about provocation			1
he made it clear that there should never be violence , especially by a man against a woman			2
for even suggesting that there could be provocation before a fight , @entity26 is now off the air			1
mind you , @entity26 never tried to justify @entity2 's actions			1
once the outcry began , @entity26 rushed to apologize			1
i do n't believe that @entity26 owed anyone an apology			1
if you listen to his entire statement , he said nothing to suggest that @entity2 's now - wife , @entity58 , " had it coming , " nor did he make any excuses for @entity2 's behavior			1
the only offense he committed was that he blathered so incoherently that he made it hard to see how he managed to get a tv show in the first place			0
so , if @entity27 wants to take him off the air and replace him with a better commentator , i 'm all for it			1
but i 'm disgusted at the rancorous , politically correct swarm that descended upon @entity26 , and the spineless reaction of the management at @entity27			1
and once the swarm gets into " beast mode , " there is no recovery			0
why ? plain and simple : sexism			0
recall that a few months ago , @entity76 attacked @entity77 when that happened , the feminist site @entity80 had this take : " the real tea is n't the fight itself , but what could have possibly gone down between the two to make @entity76 kick her sister 's husband in the balls			2
" in other words , " if she hit him , he must have done something to have it coming			0
" and this was not an outlier view			0
nobody 's outrage meter spiked there			0
no , it was " funny			0
" i 'm not defending @entity2			1
but there 's definitely a " sit down and shut up " double standard among those who seek to promote one side of this issue -- and this is less about @entity26 's comments being inappropriate			1
the gleeful rush to call for @entity26 's head is far more inappropriate			1
yes , there 's a difference between a physically huge @entity111 player beating up his fiancee and a wisp of a woman kicking @entity77 in the crotch			2
but what 's really going on here ? what 's really going on here is that one side of the debate wants to make it impermissible for the other to speak			0
take this in the context of how gender issues are presented when there are voices that dare to deviate from the feminist narrative			0
here 's an example : recently , there was a conference in @entity132 for the " @entity133 " blog and its readers			0
that controversial website has the audacity to question certain issues from a man 's perspective			0
as a result , according to news reports , this political meeting was the target of threats of violence that , in any other context , would have been called " terrorism			0
" organizers said the conference moved from the hotel where it was to be held			0
did you hear about that ? it did n't get very much press coverage			2
nobody called for a candlelight vigil			0
could you imagine if this had been the annual meeting of the @entity161 ? perhaps @entity26 is a complete ignoramus			1
or , perhaps he was misunderstood			0
and next to that , we must concede that there was very little criticism of those who said that @entity77 must have done something to provoke violence against him			0
there was no real outcry when @entity133 was the victim of what would be called " terroristic threats " if it was any other viewpoint			2
in a routine , he discusses the statement " there 's no reason to hit a woman			0
" he 's doing comedy , but he makes a really cogent point -- perhaps there is no justification for it , but why is it so taboo to ask about what happened before the violence ? " when you say there 's no reason , that kills any sort of examination as to how two people ended up at that place			0
if you say there 's no reason , you cut out the build - up , you 're just left with the act			0
how are you going to solve it if you do n't figure it out ? " he said			2
" you can only ask questions about what the guy did , you can never ask about the woman , why is that ? " why , indeed ? maybe @entity176 was on to something ? neither @entity176 , nor i , want to defend @entity2 beating up his fiancee			1
i 'm appalled that @entity2 only got a two - game suspension			1
but i 'm just as appalled that free discourse has become such a victim of the politically correct police that nobody can even ask a question , or raise any other viewpoint except to fall over themselves with condemnation			1
well , nobody except @entity176 .			0

@entity222 : *uproar* over video of @entity2 dragging unconscious fiancee from elevator
@entity27 commentator @entity26 then *slammed* for comments about possible provocation , he says
he says @entity26 did n't defend @entity2 , just raised issue of cause , but condemnation shut him up
@entity222 : in @entity26 incident , free discourse a victim of the " politically correct " police
