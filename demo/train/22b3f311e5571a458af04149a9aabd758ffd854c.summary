-- " @entity3 " is n't a word you hear much in 2013			0
it should be , though			0
and a group of modern - day freedom fighters in @entity7 is resurrecting the term -- with its echoes of @entity10 -- to combat ongoing slavery in a faraway @entity13 country			1
the @entity14 , which launched its website on monday , is a newly formed group trying to end slavery in @entity17 , a remote outpost in the @entity18 where an estimated 10 % to 20 % of people are enslaved , according to a @entity21 expert			1
" there 's just a special connection between @entity7 , where president @entity26 and president @entity27 and president @entity28 are from , and @entity17 , " said @entity22 , the group 's co-founder , who also hails from @entity7			1
" ( they 're ) different places , but with the same path			0
" hopefully that path leads to universal freedom			0
i traveled to @entity17 in december 2011 to report on the issue for @entity0 's @entity35			1
it 's an amazing and gut - wrenching place , full of vast potential but struggling to break slavery 's psychological chains			0
more than a year later , i 'm left with a deep sense of hope and cautious optimism that @entity17 will be able to break them			1
@entity22 and his nascent group are one reason for that			0
he saw the @entity0 report online in march 2012 and decided he wanted to do something to help abolish slavery in a country he 'd never visited , in the name of people who he 's mostly never met			2
" to say it changed my life and changed other peoples ' lives would be an understatement , " he said			0
the @entity14 has applied for 501 ( c ) 3 status as a nonprofit organization , @entity22 said , but has not been granted that status yet			2
its website lets users quickly petition the @entity65 and other world governments to put pressure on @entity17 to prosecute slave owners " instead of protecting them			2
" it calls slavery in @entity17 " one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time			1
" @entity22 assembled a well - connected board of directors to raise awareness about the issue and to collect funds for anti-slavery groups who work on the ground in @entity17			1
the board includes veterans of @entity28 political campaigns , the @entity87 movement , the @entity88 -- as well as @entity17 human rights activists who are now living in @entity91			1
@entity92 , whose story inspired the film " @entity100 " and who is credited with rescuing 1,200 people during the 1994 genocide in that @entity99 country , spoke at the @entity14 's grand opening			1
@entity22 , a 35 - year - old from suburban @entity102 , is following the path of many brave abolitionists in @entity17 -- several of whom i was lucky enough to meet			0
since our online project published last year , @entity107 , head of one local abolitionist group , was arrested for burning @entity112 texts he says condone slavery			0
later , after being released , he was given the @entity114 by a human rights group in @entity116			0
meanwhile , @entity117 , head of a group called @entity119 and one of the long - standing heroes of the country 's abolitionist movement , has provided assistance to women who recently escaped slavery or who come from the enslaved class			1
@entity22 had a @entity130 jersey made with @entity117 's name on it -- and wants to nominate him for a @entity133			0
@entity22 's first goal , though , is to make people aware that slavery exists in @entity17 , although government officials have denied its existence			2
and he 's smart to do so by forging ties between his state -- home to the @entity65 president who banned slavery and the country 's first @entity13 - @entity65 president -- and a country in @entity13 that continues to struggle for freedom			1
" the more people around the world who are aware of the issue the more pressure will be generated on ... @entity17 , " he said , " and the better the situation will become			2
" the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity156 .			0

new group called the @entity14 forms in @entity7
it will tackle the issue of slavery in the @entity13 country @entity17
@entity165 : the group offers hope that things will change in @entity17
the institute brings together veterans of the @entity87 and @entity100 campaigns
