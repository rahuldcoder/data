-- the tragedy of @entity3 's violent past seemed close to the surface this week as an @entity6 presidential candidate was confronted about his former role as an @entity9 commander , and @entity11 's prime minister talked with a family about a @entity14 victim of " the troubles			1
" @entity6 presidential candidate @entity16 was confronted monday by a man claiming to be the son of a soldier killed by the @entity9 in the 1980s , as @entity16 campaigned ahead of @entity20 , october 27			2
@entity21 confronted @entity16 in @entity22 , @entity3 , demanding answers about his father , @entity24 , who he said had been shot dead with a trainee police officer as they attempted to rescue a kidnapped businessman in the @entity6 in 1983			1
as shoppers and the media looked on , @entity24 demanded that @entity16 name the killers , to which @entity16 replied , " i do n't know who was responsible for the killing of your father			1
" @entity24 then accused @entity16 of having been a member of the @entity9 's ruling @entity38 at the time of the killing -- which @entity16 denied			1
" you are a liar			0
i want justice for my father , " @entity24 said			1
@entity16 , a former @entity9 commander and now a leader of the political party @entity45 , stepped down from his position as @entity3 's deputy first minister to run for president of the @entity6			2
@entity3 is part of the @entity11 , while the @entity6 is an independent state			2
meanwhile , on tuesday the widow of murdered @entity53 lawyer @entity52 and other family members will hold talks with @entity11 prime minister @entity56 about their demand for a public inquiry into his 1989 killing			1
the family says they suspect the @entity11 government sanctioned the killing			1
@entity52 , 39 , had represented @entity9 members in many high - profile cases , but he had also represented @entity67 , or loyalist , terrorists			2
he was gunned down by a loyalist gang at his @entity53 home , in front of his wife and three children			0
his family has long believed the security forces cooperated with the killers			0
the man convicted of @entity52 's murder was a police informer			1
@entity80 was the youngest at the family dinner table on the day of the killing , just 8 years old			2
now a lawyer himself , he will also attend tuesday 's meeting at @entity86			2
" the meeting is at the request of the prime minister and we expect to be told what his intentions are , " he told @entity0			1
" we are optimistic and hopeful he will announce there is an inquiry and the inquiry is one we can engage with			0
we are cautiously optimistic , but there have been let - downs over the past 22 years			0
" @entity52 says he has " absolutely no doubt " the state was involved in his father 's murder			1
" that 's not just my opinion , that 's the opinion of sir @entity106 , the most senior policeman in @entity107 , when he examined it			0
it 's also the opinion of @entity111 , " a retired @entity113 judge , " who was tasked with looking at the evidence in the case to decide whether an inquiry was necessary			2
so it 's not just my family that believe there was collusion			0
" i think it 's pretty much accepted that there was collusion in my father 's killing			1
" the question , he said , is " how high up the chain of command that went			0
" @entity52 added that , " in the absence of a transparent examination of all the relevant evidence , i believe it went as high as the office where i 'm going to meet the prime minister			1
" the @entity11 prime minister at the time was @entity139			1
while the almost daily violence of the 1970s and 1980s is a thing of the past in @entity3 , remnants of " the troubles " remain			0
some terrorist splinter groups remain active and even have the capacity to kill			0
still , the current campaign is on a much smaller scale than in the past			0
@entity45 , viewed as the @entity9 's political wing , is now a key player in the peace process and shares power with its former bitter enemies , @entity67 lawmakers , in a coalition government in @entity53			0
but this week 's events show how old wounds still haunt and divide the island			0
@entity52 believes facing the past is the key to continuing progress			0
" the issue of the past is the single most important issue that has the ability to bring both sides of the community here back to a very dark place , " he said , " and unresolved cases like my father 's do nothing but damage the present society			1
