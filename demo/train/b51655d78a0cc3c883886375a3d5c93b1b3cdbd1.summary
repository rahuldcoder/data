-- fact : the most underrated cute animal on the face of the planet is the walrus			2
sure , it 's a 4,000 - pound , breathing pile of assorted blubbery walrus parts , but so are most @entity9			1
thus , who are we to judge the walrus			2
besides , it has a mustache ! and that has to count for something			0
even if it means they 're the unintentional hipsters of the animal kingdom			0
so , yes , they 're super fat and toothy , and they probably like bands you 've never heard of , but walruses are still cute			2
and if they happen to do fun party tricks like sit - ups or playing a saxophone or @entity31 keg stands , it 's all over			2
reward the walrus with fish			0
the same applies to @entity35 : if he performs , feed the man			0
" but here 's the thing walruses are n't really ... walruses			1
apparently , now , they are officially known as wordbanks			0
about a week ago , 39 - year - old @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 was just washing dishes in his home while his wife , @entity50 , rummaged through papers in their son 's school folder			1
@entity50 walked over to @entity45 , did n't say anything , and just showed him one particular assignment from their son , @entity56			1
you see , @entity56 , who is in kindergarten , had incorrectly identified a seal as a walrus from a word bank of several different arctic animals in a matching exercise			1
which , mind you , is easy enough for anyone to do			0
especially a five - year - old			0
but that 's not the funny part			0
the seal labeling was just a small mistake			0
and , to his credit , @entity56 did correctly identify the shark			1
for that one , he chose ... wordbank			1
as in , the heading from the box where the various animal names were printed			0
" @entity50 and i could not stop laughing , " @entity45 explained to me			1
" @entity56 asked what was so funny , but flitted off to play with his brothers and sisters before we could work out what to say			1
" so , eventually , being a modern parent , @entity45 did what was absolutely necessary -- he posted @entity56 ' school assignment on the website @entity94			1
this was on wednesday evening , right before @entity45 started making dinner			1
@entity45 says that , amazingly , by the time they began eating , an image of his son 's schoolwork was already the most popular post on the main page			1
" i 've never topped @entity94 before , " he says			1
" so , it was kind of exciting to see it well - received			0
" and then @entity94 did what @entity94 does			2
by the time @entity45 and his wife started putting their five children to bed , pictures of walruses labeled as " wordbanks " started showing up everywhere , including several @entity115 - themed images			1
quite simply , @entity45 had created an internet ... thing			1
the next day , the walrus / wordbank situation got even stranger as more images and mentions started showing up on @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			2
it was a modern phenomenon , and walruses had officially become wordbanks			2
of course , @entity45 says , @entity56 does n't totally understand what 's going on , but nevertheless likes the idea of being in the news and knowing that people found humor in his schoolwork			1
and he 's sticking with it			0
@entity45 explained , " he just started saying ' wordbank ' a lot			1
which is pretty much what @entity94 did , too			2
" and it could n't have happened to a finer animal , for the walrus deserves a moment in the spotlight			0
especially before they all die			0
despite their blubbery adorableness , they are a stark reminder that being overweight is no laughing matter			0
it can lead to heart disease and diabetes			0
so , you check your blood sugar , and you check it often			0

@entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 shared his son 's schoolwork on @entity94
