-- for the past three years some of the world 's most resourceful software engineers and mathematicians have worked feverishly in the spirit of friendly , @entity6 competition -- and in pursuit of a $ 1 million prize -- to improve the @entity10 movie recommendation system by 10 percent			1
@entity10 says it will announce the winner of its $ 1 million @entity12 at an event september 21			1
it 's been a long journey , but it 's almost over			0
@entity10 said tuesday it would announce the winner at an event in @entity19 on sept. 21 -- where details about the @entity12 2 sequel would also be unveiled			1
as things stand now , nobody outside of @entity10 knows which team will win the million - dollar prize , but the winning entry will power @entity10 's upcoming movie recommendation engine			1
because nothing about the contest barred entrants from licensing their technology to companies other than @entity10 , both qualifying teams could find plenty of licensees -- even if they come in second			0
and not much separates the two top teams			0
@entity38 ( @entity39 ) , @entity40 and @entity41 combined to form @entity38 's @entity42 , the first team to qualify for the prize on june 26 with a 10.05 percent improvement over @entity10 's existing algorithm			1
this triggered a 30 - day window in which other teams were allowed to try to catch up -- and indeed , a team called @entity50 , made up of lower - ranked contestants , submitted a higher score of 10.10 percent as time ran out -- a hair better than @entity38 's @entity42 ' final score of 10.09 percent			1
before sept. 21 , @entity10 must decide ( assuming they have n't done so already ) which of the two qualifying teams has the best algorithm based on how they score on various undisclosed tests			2
the company must also determine whether the winning team 's results are reproducible , meaning that its algorithm handles new data as well as it did the test data			0
when we wrote about this last month , after the window for qualifying closed , @entity10 declined to say whether it will reveal details about its methodology for picking the winner ( whichever team loses , they 're going to want to know how , exactly , that happened -- as will curious onlookers around the world )			1
a @entity10 spokeswoman told us , " we are definitely going to touch on the methodology in the press conference , " and offered to let us interview @entity10 executives to find out more about how they picked the winner			2
@entity10 vice president of communications @entity80 told us last month that the company is pleased with the results of the contest , and apparently , it hopes there 's more where that came from			2
at the same @entity19 event where it will announce the @entity12 winner , the company plans to unveil details about @entity12 2			1
writing on @entity10 message boards , chief product officer @entity90 already offered some hints : " the next contest will be a shorter , time - limited race , with grand prizes for the best results at 6 and 18 months			0
while the first contest has been remarkable , we think @entity98 will be more challenging , more fun , and even more useful to the field			0
" more than 40,000 teams from 186 countries competed for the first @entity12			0
some contestants doubted that any team would be capable of surmounting the 10 - percent - improvement barrier , but two teams managed to do so			0
clearly , @entity10 has stumbled onto a winning formula here , and will walk away from the contest with a measurably improved movie recommendation engine -- and recommendations are a linchpin of its business			2
as the field of " prize economics " evolves , offering organizations increasingly efficient ways to solve their problems , we expect results like this to become more commonplace			0
