@entity0 -- as the @entity2 prepares to take some troops out of @entity4 this july , an ambitious program to persuade @entity4 insurgents to leave the fight has managed so far to attract only 1,700 converts over the past 10 months , according to a general leading the " reintegration " effort			1
but the killing of @entity13 may convince more to turn , the general says			1
the @entity2 and its allies have contributed $ 141 million to the program of amnesty and reintegration			1
and estimates are that 20,000 to 25,000 fighters remain in the field , despite efforts to persuade both @entity23 leaders and foot soldiers to cross over			1
" it is gaining increasing authenticity			0
people know they can step out of the fight , " @entity28 maj. gen. @entity27 said thursday in a video link from @entity4 to the @entity30			1
he heads up the allied reintegration effort for the @entity34 ( @entity34 )			2
@entity27 said @entity35 have talks underway with 40 to 45 @entity23 and insurgent groups , representing maybe a total of 2,000 additional fighters			1
he said there had been new interest after @entity2 commandos killed @entity13 in @entity43 early this month			1
" we were talking to some officers from the ( @entity4 ) @entity46 this morning and they were quite clear that that the expressions of interest of low level and mid level groups to join the program has picked up considerably over the last couple of weeks			2
@entity2 secretary of defense @entity53 said soon after the raid that @entity13 's death opens the door to @entity23 parting ways with @entity58			1
" if that could happen at the same time we 're keeping military pressure on the @entity23 , keep them from taking back what you guys seized from them , expand the security bubble , you may actually next winter have the potential for reconciliation talks that are ... meaningful in terms of going forward , because one of the red lines for both us and the @entity4 government ( is ) the @entity23 disavowing any role with @entity58 , " @entity53 told @entity73 at @entity74 in @entity75 on may 12			1
potential recruits to the reintegration program are interviewed , photographed and fingerprinted , and they can be sheltered in safe houses and receive a stipend before returning to their villages			1
but @entity27 admitted problems with the program			2
" inevitably if you start with a paper document and you have to build this airplane as you fly it , so to speak , then you are going to have challenges meeting demands			0
" for some fighters , leaving the battlefield can be an impossible step			2
" there still is a sense among a lot of the fighters that this smacks too much of surrender and their honor and dignity as fighting men ... ca n't quite take it as yet , " @entity27 said			0
" there is still that psychology playing out there			0
" another problem is what @entity27 described as " the predatory reach " of insurgents who cross the border from @entity4 to punish and kill those they see as disloyal			0
and he denied problems with fighters taking refuge in the program , only to return to the insurgency			2
" thus far the people who have come -- the 17 hundred who have come in recent months -- have shown no signs of recidivism yet			0
there is no sense they are coming in to wait out the fighting season and go back , " @entity27 said			0
in the long term , success of reintegration will depend on overall military and political momentum in the country			0
there are no certainties in @entity4 -- that is one of the things we have learned over the past 10 years , " @entity27 said , predicting a tough fighting - season in coming months			0
" at its heart this is a very human process			0
it requires people on both sides of the divide to make really courageous and life - changing decisions			0

" people know they can step out of the fight , " says a @entity28 general
about 1,700 insurgents have entered the reintegration program , he says
estimates are that as many as 25,000 @entity23 fighters remain in the field
the killing of @entity13 may convince more to turn , the general says .
