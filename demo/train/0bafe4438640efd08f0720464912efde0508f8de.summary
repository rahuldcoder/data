@entity0 @entity3 's announcement that she would step down from her @entity5 seat is the golden opportunity that many of @entity10 's @entity9 stars have waited years for , and it 's touching off one of the most unpredictable and expensive scrambles for federal office in the @entity14 in years			1
with @entity10 's two @entity5 seats locked down for more than two decades by @entity3 and sen. @entity16 , @entity3 's announcement thursday -- via a video with her grandson -- set up a key test of the state 's top - two primary system			1
given the shallow @entity25 bench in @entity10 , many political observers predicted a fierce runoff in november 2016 between two of the state 's top democrats , depending on who emerges from the june primary			1
top @entity9 contenders weigh @entity34 run " there 's an entire generation of @entity9 politicians who have been waiting for an opportunity like this one , " said @entity35 , executive director of the @entity37 at the @entity38			1
" that 's a lot of pent up energy and ambition			0
" three of the strongest potential @entity9 contenders for the seat — attorney general @entity50 , lt. gov. @entity51 and billionaire environmentalist @entity52 — have been coy about their plans , praising @entity3 's long tenure as a champion for progressive causes , but staying mum on their own ambitions			1
former @entity0 mayor @entity61 released a statement saturday expressing his interest : " too many @entity64 are struggling to make ends meet , pay the bills , and send their kids to college			2
they are looking for progressive leaders in @entity72 who will fight for them , like @entity3 has done for over 20 years , " the former @entity0 mayor said in a statement			2
" the urgency of the needs of the people of this great state have convinced me to seriously consider looking at running for @entity10 's open @entity5 seat			1
" @entity52 is expected to make a decision within days			0
for the others , there was a political chess match underway behind the scenes			0
@entity3 's vacancy could be just the first of three statewide openings in @entity10 in the next few years			1
the governor 's office will be vacant in 2018 and that 's when @entity16 's current term expires			0
she could step down , though the 81 - year - old senator has given no indication that she will retire			0
@entity93 on @entity3 retirement : ' what ? ' @entity96 , @entity51 and @entity61 have all expressed interest to confidantes in running both for @entity5 and @entity100 's race over the years			1
@entity96 and @entity51 share the same @entity10 - based strategists , including @entity102 , raising the possibility they could strike a pact where @entity96 runs for @entity3 's seat and @entity51 waits to run for @entity100 after his two terms as lieutenant governor			1
( @entity102 , who also advised @entity61 before the former @entity0 mayor returned to the private sector , is often mentioned as potential top strategist for @entity111 's 2016 campaign )			1
the two @entity10 politicians have an amicable , if not close , relationship			2
if pitted against one another , they could split that region of the state between them -- clearing a path for a strong @entity120 candidate like @entity61 , who has won prior races with strong support from @entity123			2
increasing speculation about a deal this week , @entity96 and @entity51 sent a message of unity on monday when @entity51 chose the attorney general to administer his oath of office at his swearing in for his second term as lieutenant governor			2
another wild card are the future plans of gov. @entity136 , who faces term limits in 2018 after his fourth term as governor			0
@entity51 , who has had a fraught relationship with @entity136 over the years , withdrew from his first bid for governor in 2009 after struggling to raise money with the specter of @entity136 entering the race			1
@entity136 , who barely campaigned in his re-election race last year and won overwhelmingly , has said little about what he would do after the governor 's office			2
beyond those big names -- which rose to the top because of their strong fundraising potential in @entity10 , and @entity52 's ability to self - fund -- the list of potential candidates seemed almost endless thursday			1
more than a half - dozen members of @entity157 are weighing whether to jump into the race , as well as a number of state lawmakers and treasurer @entity161 , who is widely talked about as an underestimated candidate			2
but federal limits on fundraising are far more restrictive than state limits — setting up steep challenges for any of the contenders			0
further complicating matters for @entity9 , many well funded labor groups who have played an active role in other state races will be wary of choosing sides between high profile @entity9			2
while @entity25 @entity177 would be the most formidable candidate on the @entity25 side , he is unlikely to leave his post as @entity180			0
@entity3 's opponent in 2010 , former @entity182 ceo @entity181 , now resides in @entity183 and is weighing a run for president			1
" i do n't think there 's an obvious ( @entity25 ) contender , " said longtime @entity25 strategist @entity186 , who advised @entity181 in her run against @entity3 in 2010			1
" @entity10 has become a very , very difficult state			0
it 's going to be somewhat easier not to have to run against an incumbent , but 2016 will be a presidential year -- so the result is that there will be a lot heavier @entity9 turnout , which makes it an even bigger hill to climb for a @entity25			1
" other republicans who could throw their hat in the ring include @entity201 , who ran unsuccessfully for governor against @entity136 last year , as well as @entity204 mayor @entity203			0
but few @entity25 aspirants are thought to have a chance against the top tier @entity9 contenders			1
" this race is going to cost $ 20 million just to get to the starting gate , " said longtime @entity10 political analyst @entity209			2
" there is nobody who would be likely to run as a @entity25 who could come up with that kind of money			0
" ( @entity3 , in conjunction with party committees raised more than $ 35 million for her 2010 re-election bid )			0
rep. @entity220 , who could have funded his own campaign , withdrew his name from consideration			0
democrat @entity224 was among the first to step aside , saying he was focused on his new job as @entity0 mayor			0
@entity3 , who is 74 and was elected with @entity16 in the so - called " year of the woman " in 1992 , did not reveal her leanings toward a potential successor during a call with reporters thursday afternoon			1
if faced with a competitive @entity9 race for her seat , she could very well opt not to endorse given how many people underestimated her in her own @entity5 race in 1992			1
when she ran in that cycle against two formidable @entity9 , then - lt. gov. @entity237 and rep. @entity238 , @entity3 was pressured to drop out , but pulled off a surprise victory : " i was an asterisk , " she mused thursday			1
she said discussions of an endorsement were premature : " i do n't know if one person will come forward or if 15 will come forward , " @entity3 told reporters on a call thursday			0
she said she made her decision over the holidays to be fair to the contenders			0
" i am doing it this early , " @entity3 said , " because i think it 's important for the field -- give them plenty of time to look at this ; do n't give any one person the advantage , and just send the message out loud and clear			2
" @entity16 similarly did not tip her hand on who she would favor in the race , but she noted that the candidates would need to get off to a fast start given the enormous expense of running a statewide campaign in @entity10			1
" most candidates do n't realize , until they 've run , how big the state is and how you have to reach people , " @entity16 said during a press gaggle on @entity267 thursday			0
" you have to figure : ' how many hands can i shake in two years			0
100,000 ? 200,000 ? ' ( you 've ) got 38 million people			0
so it really comes down to media , unfortunately			0
" @entity1 's @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278 contributed to this report			0

@entity61 says he *'ll* ' seriously consider ' a run
