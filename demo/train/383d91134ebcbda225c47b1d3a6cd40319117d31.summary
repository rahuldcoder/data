the first overseas tour by the @entity1 and @entity2 -- @entity3 -- was an undisputed triumph			1
the couple , still basking in the glow of their globally televised wedding , drew vast crowds throughout @entity10 and @entity11			0
will their hosts in @entity13 be charmed as easily ? here 's my best guess as to where and when the likely highlights will be			0
the most poignant moment would undoubtedly be at the start of the tour in @entity21			2
in 1997 , the @entity22 named an orchid after prince @entity25 's mother , @entity24 , with the intention of presenting it to her on her next visit -- but she died before she had a chance to see it			1
@entity25 completed what @entity24 could not on the first day of his tour tuesday			2
he and his wife also had an orchid named after them			0
the next stop , @entity36 , will take on a more excitable tone -- and it 's all about @entity38			1
a bigger population means bigger crowds , and the @entity41 is doing what it can to whip up interest by tweeting details of where you can rub shoulders with the couple			0
@entity49 will give only her second public speech at a hospice in @entity52			0
public speaking does n't come naturally to @entity38 , but she clearly wants to make the hospice movement a key part of her public role : her first public speech as a royal was at @entity60 's @entity59 , the hospice charity she supports in the @entity62			0
@entity38 will be more comfortable on thursday night for what 's set to be the most glamorous evening of the tour : full frocks and rocks for a state dinner hosted by the @entity68 , whose name -- @entity70 @entity71 -- takes some getting used to			2
luckily for the @entity1 and @entity2 , the king -- who attended @entity73 -- speaks fluent @entity74			1
from the city to the jungles of @entity77 on saturday and the couple will visit a conservation project in @entity80 , recommended to them by @entity82 , who shares a passion for the environment with his eldest son			2
royal photographers are holding out for an encounter with orangutans as the couple negotiate rope bridges high up in the forest canopy			0
on sunday , expect a big @entity92 welcome in the @entity93 and a canoe trip to paradise			0
after a series of formal engagements , the @entity1 and @entity2 will spend the night at the luxury @entity99 resort before heading off to their final destination : the remote island of @entity103 , where the @entity104 is head of state and her husband , prince @entity105 , is revered as a god			1
when @entity25 's grandparents visited @entity103 they were carried on the shoulders of warriors , creating one of the abiding images of the @entity104 's 60 - year reign			1
the @entity1 and @entity2 are likely to get the same treatment when they arrive there next week as they cement their role as the next generation of @entity62 -- and @entity103 -- royalty .			1

@entity1 and @entity2 hope to *repeat* *success* of their @entity3 tour
stops on their *itinerary* *include* @entity21 , @entity36 and @entity77
final stop is @entity103 , where prince @entity25 's grandfather , prince @entity105 , is revered as a god
