with @entity0 finally called and the 2012 presidential election falling into the rear view mirror , here 's a look at another reason why president @entity6 won re-election : the @entity8 held their " blue wall " -- the cluster of eastern , @entity12 and western states that have traditionally gone @entity8 and were crucial to his victory			1
" @entity8 held the entire ' blue wall '			2
they have now won 18 states in at least six consecutive elections , the most states they have won that often ever , since the formation of the modern party system in 1828 , " says @entity20 senior political analyst and national journal editorial director @entity21			0
what states make up this so - called " blue wall " ? when history speaks : @entity28 's three lessons for an @entity6 second term start in the mid-atlantic and head north into @entity31 : @entity33 , @entity32 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			2
the only state not included in this list is @entity44 , a perennial swing state			0
add three @entity47 states ( @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 ) and @entity51 , and the reliably blue @entity12 states ( @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56 )			0
put all those states together and add the @entity58 , and you total 242 electoral votes			2
that 's a nice starting point for any @entity8 nominee , considering that 270 is the magic number needed to win the @entity64			1
@entity20 @entity66 map : you do the math many of the october public opinion polls indicated the president with the slight edge in the eight swing states ( according to @entity20 's electoral map )			0
that may explain why @entity76 became the latest @entity78 presidential nominee to try to make a last - minute bid to breach the " blue wall , " with moves in @entity34 , @entity55 and @entity54			1
but once again , it did n't work			0
as the nation 's demographics continue to shift , @entity85 and even @entity86 may eventually be added to the " blue wall , " making the @entity78 's path to the presidency increasingly difficult			2
" until @entity78 can crack the ' blue wall , ' @entity8 start with a base of 242 @entity66 votes , which means a @entity78 nominee must thread the needle , or practically run the table , to get to 270 , " adds @entity21			1
the @entity78 , on the other hand , have their " red wall " -- the large southern , @entity98 and @entity99 states that cover a lot of geography but not as many electoral votes , like @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and others			1
but together , the " red wall " only nets @entity78 177 electoral votes at most			1
the big question confronting @entity78 : " how to crack that wall " ? with director @entity117 's new film " @entity119 " opening to critical praise , @entity20 polling director @entity114 sees a comparison of today 's " blue wall " to the coalition of states that put @entity78 @entity28 in the @entity64 in 1860			1
@entity124 : election a call for purple politics " there are some differences : @entity58 and @entity51 were n't in the @entity130 at the time and @entity32 and @entity33 were slave - holding states			0
@entity28 also added @entity44 , @entity133 and @entity134 to the list of " blue wall " states in order to win the @entity64 , " says @entity114			1
" the @entity78 was the ' big government ' party back then , willing to use the government 's power not just to resolve the slavery issue , but also for big government programs like the @entity144 , the land - grant college program , and the @entity146 -- all projects which a lot of @entity8 opposed at the time as going beyond the bounds of the government 's authority			0
the parties have changed sides , but it looks like the underlying attitudes in those states that put them in the ' blue wall ' category may be similar to what they were in @entity28 's time , " adds @entity114 .			0

' blue wall ' states traditionally go @entity8 in presidential elections
those states *accounted* for 242 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the @entity64
@entity78 ' red wall , ' on the other hand , only makes up 177 electoral votes , at most
