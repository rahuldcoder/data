@entity0 -- president @entity2 , who took his renewed pitch to cut taxes for the middle class to @entity6 tuesday , and @entity8 presidential candidate @entity7 ratcheted up the tense back and forth over outsourcing work overseas in an appeal to those hit hardest by the economic downturn			1
at its core , the debate is a fierce battle to win the support of middle class voters -- especially those in battleground states			1
the @entity2 campaign continued hammering @entity7 over his private equity firm , @entity21 , which " owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the @entity26 to overseas call centers and factories making computer components , " according to a television advertisement released saturday			1
@entity2 's campaign has also been forcefully pushing a @entity33 report that calls @entity7 's former private equity firm , @entity21 , a " pioneer " in outsourcing jobs overseas			1
the campaign has made the report a focal point of its ads against @entity7 , and the president frequently mentions it in his stump speeches			0
@entity7 and the @entity8 have spent the past few days fighting back against the @entity2 campaign 's line of attack that when the former @entity47 governor was at @entity21 he outsourced jobs overseas to the detriment of middle - class @entity26 workers			1
@entity53 chairman @entity52 , who was also in @entity6 as part of a @entity8 strategy of " bracketing " the president 's public appearances in battleground states , unveiled a new website , called @entity61 , which the @entity53 said shows instances where the president 's policies have led to job creation overseas			1
@entity7 addressed the issue during a stop in @entity68 , @entity69			0
" it is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of @entity26 jobs himself by putting money into energy companies -- solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the @entity26 , " @entity7 said			2
" if there 's an outsourcer - in - chief , it 's the president of the @entity26 , not the guy who 's running to replace him			0
" in response , @entity2 's campaign said : " president @entity2 has fought continuously to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas , fostered incentives for companies to bring jobs back to @entity26 and doubled the rate of trade enforcement actions we 've taken against @entity99 to ensure an even playing field for @entity26 workers , " the statement read			1
in addition to @entity52 ' event , @entity7 's campaign is also pointing to a new story in the @entity33 that details criticism of @entity2 for allowing domestic jobs to shift overseas			1
" @entity26 jobs have been shifting to low - wage countries for years , and the trend has continued during @entity2 's presidency , " states the article , published online monday night			1
during his campaign rally in @entity115 , @entity6 , a state the president won by 10 points in the 2008 election , the president held a roundtable discussion with an @entity6 family and then talked about middle - class tax relief at a campaign event			1
that message included a call to pass a one - year extension of the @entity127 - era tax cuts for households making less than $ 250,000 a year and let cuts for wealthier @entity26 expire			0
" we 're going to have two choices in this election			0
and one choice is to take us down a path of top - down economics and an approach that says if we do good for folks at the very top , somehow everybody benefits , " @entity2 told the crowd			2
" and my vision , which says , when we grow best it 's because our middle class is doing well and everybody who 's fighting to get into the middle class			1
" @entity2 's renewed push to extend the tax cuts also serves to steer the conversation from friday 's news of relatively stagnant job growth rate and an unemployment rate of 8.2 %			1
the mission for both candidates , political experts say , is to frame their messages in a way that makes it clear each empathizes with the plight of those who are struggling to make ends meet			0
facing a tough re-election fight against @entity7 , the @entity2 campaign seeks to frame the contest as a debate between the president 's goal of restoring middle - class opportunity versus @entity8 policies that it says would primarily benefit corporations and wealthy @entity26			1
for @entity2 that message is , " ' we 're coming back			0
we 're producing jobs and we 're trying to restore fairness , ' " said @entity170 , who was a speechwriter for dozens of @entity173 political figures , including former vice president @entity174 , and is author of " the @entity177 's companion			1
" @entity7 's challenge is to shake the image of a wealthier , disconnected business executive and convince voters that his experience as a leader in his field gives him the qualifications to be the nation 's leader			2
for @entity7 the message is , " there are too many people out of work and it 's terrible , " @entity170 said , adding that @entity7 needs to make clear that he " feels for the people who are having a hard time			2
" a recent @entity1 / @entity197 poll conducted june 28 - july 1 , with 1,517 adult @entity26 , including 1,390 registered voters , also indicates that while voters are divided on whether @entity2 or @entity7 would do a better job on the economy , @entity7 holds an edge among crucial independent voters in the race for the @entity205			1
forty - eight percent of registered voters say the president would better handle the economy , with 47 % saying @entity7 would do a better job			2
president @entity2 's re-election team is working overtime to paint @entity7 as someone who is rich and out of touch			1
the campaign has kept up the attacks on @entity7 over what is described as his lack of transparency			0
a new web video released by the @entity2 campaign tuesday claims that the presumptive @entity8 presidential nominee is " defying calls to release more than one year 's worth of tax returns			2
" and at a @entity227 speech for the @entity229 convention , a large @entity230 civil rights group , vice president @entity225 continued the campaign 's recent blitz against @entity7 over reports of his offshore investments			0
in january , @entity7 released his tax returns for 2010 and an estimate for 2011			0
federal campaign law does not require candidates to release tax returns , but it does require candidates to file annual financial disclosure paperwork , which @entity7 has done			0
however , the @entity2 re-election team often points to @entity7 's father , the late @entity243 , who released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968			2
" his son has released one year of his tax returns			0
making a lie of the old adage : like father , like son , " @entity225 said			0
as the campaigns continue the messaging slugfest , there are some pitfalls they must avoid , @entity170 said			2
" the worst thing for @entity2 to do would be to sound apologetic all the time or to say we have n't done all that we wanted to do , " @entity170 said			0
for @entity7 , the worse thing " would be to concede too much to what the administration has done			0
but i do n't think there 's any chance @entity7 would do that			0
" @entity1 's @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity2 , @entity7 argue over who sent more jobs overseas
@entity2 's pitch to middle - class voters continues in @entity6
@entity8 and @entity173 are fighting to appeal to middle class voters
both campaigns must avoid political pitfalls in the messaging battle
