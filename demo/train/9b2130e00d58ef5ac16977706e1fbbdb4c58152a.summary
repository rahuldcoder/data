prime minister @entity0 gave up the fight thursday to keep his post , clearing the way for a new leader that many hope can hold @entity6 together as the country battles brutal extremist fighters			1
in a televised address , @entity0 withdrew his candidacy for a third term and endorsed the prime minister - designate , bringing to an end a political battle that just days ago saw him vow to hold onto power as he ordered tanks into the streets			1
" i announce to you today that i am withdrawing my candidacy in deference to my brother , @entity21 , in the highest interest of the country , " he said			0
the news -- first flashed on state television -- follows mounting pressure , at home and abroad , for @entity0 to step aside and make way for someone to bridge the sectarian divide that many accuse him of fomenting			1
the move comes at a critical time in @entity6 as @entity36 fighters with the so - called @entity37 , formerly known as the @entity38 , force hundreds of thousands from their homes as they seize large swaths of land			1
@entity0 's announcement came the same day that @entity44 president @entity43 declared the @entity38 siege that trapped thousands in the @entity46 over , but warned the crisis is far from solved			1
while humanitarian airdrops and @entity44 airstrikes saved those stranded from starving and provided safe passage off out of the mountains , the @entity48 arrived by the thousands at camps in and outside @entity6			1
@entity0 will continue to serve as the country 's caretaker prime minister -- as well as its top military commander -- until @entity21 forms a new government			1
@entity0 's acquiescence was a turnaround for the man , who in recent days called the appointment of @entity21 unconstitutional and said he would not step down			1
he had gone so far as to file a lawsuit in federal court to stop the formation of a new government and ordered tanks and soldiers loyal to him into the streets of @entity73 , raising concerns of a possible coup			0
but with world leaders , diplomats , members of his own political party and the country 's most revered @entity81 cleric pressuring him to step down , @entity0 gave up the fight			1
calling it in an " honorable decision " by @entity0 , @entity44 secretary of state @entity84 urged @entity21 to move quickly to form the government , saying it is essential to pulling the country 's various ethnic and religious groups together to fight a common enemy in @entity38			1
who 's @entity93 , the man who will lead @entity6 ? while @entity6 works to seat a new government , @entity43 said in a televised address on thursday that the @entity44 will continue to conduct airstrikes to protect @entity44 personnel and facilities			1
the @entity44 carried out airstrikes thursday against three @entity38 targets northeast of the @entity102 regional capital of @entity103 , according to the @entity104			1
the targets were @entity44 - manufactured mine - resistant ambush - protected vehicles , more commonly known as @entity108 , and other armored vehicles being driven by @entity38 fighters			1
the vehicles are believed to have been seized by @entity38 after it routed @entity6 troops in northern @entity6			1
also , there were reports that @entity38 fighters were advancing south and west of @entity115 , about 240 kilometers ( 149 miles ) north of @entity73			2
at the same time , @entity43 urged @entity6 's @entity81 - dominated government to seize " the enormous opportunity of forming a new inclusive government " under @entity21			0
" he still has a challenging task in putting a government together , but we are modestly hopeful that the @entity6 government situation is moving in the right direction , " he said			0
the new battleground in @entity6 appeared to be spreading to the south and west of @entity115 , where @entity38 fighters occupied four towns to the south and west of @entity115 , according to @entity130 , a researcher at the @entity131			2
according to his sources in the field , there was fighting ongoing between @entity38 and @entity102 fighters , known as @entity137 , in the town of @entity139			2
the town is home to a number of @entity143 , an ethnic minority in @entity6			0
the @entity145 estimates that more than 400,000 people have been driven from their homes since june , when @entity38 swept across the border from @entity149 into @entity6			2
of those displaced , more than 200,000 have poured into northern @entity151 in recent weeks , where refugee camp populations have swelled since @entity38 began its assault against @entity48 , @entity154 , @entity102 and @entity81			2
thousands of other refugees sought protection inside the northern @entity102 region of @entity6			0
" to be blunt , we do n't have housing for all of them			0
we do n't have shelter , " a spokesman for the @entity145 human rights commissioner , @entity162 , said at a camp near the @entity165 bridge where @entity6 are entering the area			0
" thousands of tents are being erected as we speak			0
" yazidi refugees were also fleeing across the @entity6 border into @entity149			0
as of thursday , there were about 15,000 @entity48 refugees from @entity6 who arrived at the @entity175 camp in @entity149 , the @entity145 refugee agency said			0
thousands more are arriving , the agency said			0
the @entity48 fled last week in the @entity46 as @entity38 overran the city of @entity179			2
a senior commander said @entity38 fighters abducted more than 100 @entity48 women and children from the community			2
the @entity38 commander , who has knowledge of the events that unfolded , said the fighters killed a large number of men when they took over the town more than a week ago			2
" at that time , they took @entity48 women and children , and i can confirm those women and children have entered @entity198 , " the commander said by telephone			0
" ... the @entity37 is taking this opportunity to call them to @entity201			0
" while @entity203 can not independently confirm the claim , it follows reports by survivors who describe @entity38 fighters grabbing families and separating the men from the women and children .			0
