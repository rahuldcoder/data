as expected , @entity0 has launched a @entity2 - like mobile app that lets users trade ephemeral photo - and video - based messages			1
but that 's not what 's most interesting about it			0
with the new app , called @entity11 , you ca n't view an incoming message until you respond with a photo or video of your own			1
that 's right : there can be no passive users on @entity11 , which is basically forcing its community to trade photos and video clips , quid pro quo , like schoolkids exchanging stickers or lunchbox snacks			1
" with @entity11 , we wanted to build something where everybody is a creator and nobody is just a spectator , " its creators said tuesday in a blog post announcing the app. " when everyone participates , there 's less pressure , more creativity and even the little things in life can turn into awesome shared experiences			0
" judging by initial reaction , however , at least some users may find this stricture a little annoying			0
" it 's frustrating , not exciting when a friend sends you a shot and you ca n't immediately view it , " wrote @entity42 in tech - news site @entity44			2
" @entity11 is a new and strange example of a messaging app that raises barriers instead of tearing them down , and increases the friction to viewing a friend 's photo instead of reducing it			1
" in fairness , the app is designed not for sending urgent information -- we have texting or even phone calls for that -- but for exchanging spontaneous moments or snippets of creativity			0
@entity0 said @entity11 is available in the @entity65 , starting tuesday , on @entity66 ( @entity67 ) and @entity68 ( @entity69 and @entity70 )			2
a spokeswoman said the app will roll out to other countries in the future			0
@entity11 , which leaked briefly last week before @entity0 pulled it offline , is the social networking giant 's latest attempt to compete with @entity2 , a rival messaging app that is popular with teens and young adults			1
snapchat is estimated to have more than 30 million users and reportedly turned down a $ 3 billion acquisition offer from @entity0 last fall			2
@entity0 later went on to buy @entity80 , a messaging app that 's especially widespread overseas			1
slingshot succeeds @entity83 , a messaging app that @entity0 launched in 2012 and shut down last month after it failed to gain traction with users			1
slingshot messages are photo and video only , although users can superimpose bits of text on the images			0
like @entity2 ( and @entity83 ) , @entity11 messages are n't meant to be saved			1
they vanish once the user responds to them or swipes them away -- a slight distinction from @entity2 messages , which by default disappear after a few seconds			2
" photos and videos that do n't stick around forever allow for sharing that 's more expressive , raw and spontaneous			0
we can connect the same way we like to live : in the moment , " @entity0 said in its post , which takes the unusual step of crediting its competitor			0
" we 've enjoyed using @entity2 to send each other ephemeral messages and expect there to be a variety of apps that explore this new way of sharing , " it said			0
unlike @entity2 , @entity11 allows users to send , or " sling , " messages to multiple friends at once			1
a push notification will appear when somebody sends you something , but you 'll only see a pixelated image until you respond .			0
