@entity0 -- major royal tours like the one the @entity3 and @entity4 embarked on this month act as milestones in a royal career			1
the images that come out of them will be used in perpetuity to illustrate an ongoing history of monarchy			1
in @entity14 and @entity0 there have been dozens pictures that made great magazine spreads but i have chosen three that i think say something more			2
the royal ' crawl - about ' on the face of things , this was just a play date at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity14 , but it had been organized for a future king and was the starting gun for a lifetime of official engagements for @entity29			0
i chose a picture from the end of the event because it 's also an intimate portrait of a close - knit family unit with hands - on parents who people can relate to			0
every parent has had one of these moments and it 's what makes parenthood worth it			0
@entity45 sunset @entity46 has never been to @entity0 before and what stronger message could there be to say she has arrived ? it 's a rite of passage for tourists to have a picture taken at @entity45 at sunset			1
but this image is also loaded with family history			0
prince @entity54 and @entity55 posed in the same spot on their first foreign tour as a family			2
the interesting thing here is that @entity4 and @entity63 's picture did n't work			1
the shoot was rushed and the couple looked awkward			1
you can even see the shadows of photographers at their feet			0
this picture places @entity4 in a country where she will be @entity72 but it also speaks to the media pressure the couple are under and trying to juggle			2
future head of state prince @entity63 knows he has n't been the headline act of this tour , with the spotlight firmly fixed on his wife and son			1
but look closely and there 's been an interesting shift in his public appearances			0
there were the usual fun moments , typified by sporting challenges with his wife and intimate moments with his son , but there 's also a creeping formality to his engagements			0
this was most obvious for me when he sat down with the @entity0 prime minister , @entity98 , in @entity99			2
it was a kingly side that i ca n't remember seeing in him before -- prince @entity63 is a future head of state			1
during this tour we got to know a new generation of royalty ( @entity106 ) but we also saw an existing one ( @entity63 and @entity4 ) mature			2
they are doing it in their own way by focusing on events that reflect their personal interests ( conservation , the military , sport , young people and hospices ) and they 've done so to rapturous praise in the @entity0 media and amongst the political leadership			1
if they have n't killed off the republican debate , they 've at least put it on the back burner			0
they 've also added a chapter to their official biography .			0
