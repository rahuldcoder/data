@entity0 , wanted in the @entity1 for the torture and killing of @entity5 agent @entity4 , has been ordered released from a @entity7 prison because of procedural errors in his case			1
a federal court in the state of @entity12 overturned @entity0 's conviction for the kidnapping and killing the @entity1 agent in 1985			1
