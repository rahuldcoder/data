-- the @entity2 slum of @entity3 has long suffered from high rates of unemployment , crime and school dropouts , and the end of apartheid did little to change the situation			1
but hundreds of children are starting to find hope thanks to @entity13 , who is changing the community through education			1
@entity13 's nonprofit , the @entity16 , provides free academic support , meals and after - school activities to more than 400 children living in the slum			1
@entity0 asked @entity13 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity24 of 2012			1
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean for the @entity16 ? @entity13 : it means we can continue to grow as an organization , and it has helped us educate people about the life that we live here			2
@entity3 is one of the very old communities around @entity35 , but it 's still lacking in things like schools , electricity , running water			2
but this does n't stop the children in our program from continuing to believe in their dreams			2
the recognition has also taught us that through hard work everything is possible , but it has also brought us a big challenge : we should always be working hard , because we will never know who is watching us ! @entity0 : what was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 @entity24 ? @entity13 : @entity16 people heard me shouting , and they wanted to know what was happening			1
i immediately told them that we have made it ! they went straight to the computers to double - check			2
after that , we started singing our @entity16 songs , celebrating that we are part of history in the making for our country and continent			0
tears fell from my eyes , thinking how proud my mom was going to be seeing her struggle paying off to the nation			0
and i was then touched when a colleague said this achievement is dedicated to my late brother , @entity74 , who passed away in april			0
more from @entity24 : finding ' diamonds ' in @entity76 @entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity24 ? @entity13 : our plan is to build a computer lab , provide school uniforms for the year 2013 and buy a solar geyser ( to heat water ) for our kitchen			1
it will also help provide relevant training for our staff so that we can be more competent in the work that we do			0
we believe that is very important , so our team can also grow with the organization			0
we want to strengthen the programs that we have , especially the tutorial program			0
we 've been visiting a number of educational institutions around @entity97 to see how we can strengthen it , what resources and skills we need			2
for us to succeed , we need to make sure our tutorial program is strong			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity13 : the most important thing that i would like people to know about @entity16 is that it is an organization that is community - needs driven , and it is led by the youth of @entity3 that want to break the poverty cycle that has existed for many decades			1
this will be done through formal and nonformal education , where people will be empowered in things they are good at			0
... we believe that if people are guided to what they are interested in , that is setting them up for success			0
