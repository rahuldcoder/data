@entity1 's foreign ministry denied published reports that a woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her @entity6 faith is expected to be released			1
foreign ministry spokesman @entity7 said that he is not aware of any plans to release @entity10 before a ruling from an appeals court			1
@entity13 was condemned to die by hanging after she declined to profess she is a @entity16 , the religion of her father			1
sharia law considers her a muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a @entity6			1
she is unlikely to change her mind despite giving birth in prison , says her husband @entity24 , who also is a @entity6			1
some western media outlets have reported that @entity13 would be released in a few days , but her husband said that only the appeals court could free his wife			1
" i 'm not aware that any release is imminent , " @entity24 told @entity29			0
technically , the president of @entity1 can not pardon her , so the judiciary might be the only way out for the government , which is coming under increased international pressure to release @entity13			1
the court convicted her of apostasy and adultery two weeks ago			2
at the time , she was eight months pregnant			0
she gave birth to a baby girl this week at a @entity43 prison , where she 's detained with @entity44 , her 20 - month - old son			1
despite languishing in prison with two infants , she 's holding firm to her beliefs , according to her husband			1
" there is pressure on her from @entity16 religious leaders that she should return to the faith , " @entity24 told @entity29 in a tv exclusive			2
" she said , ' how can i return when i never was a @entity16 ? yes , my father was a muslim , but i was brought up by my mother			0
' " @entity24 said his wife is a practicing @entity6 , more so than him , and even had their son baptized			1
" i know my wife			0
she 's committed , " he said			2
" even last week , they brought in sheikhs and she told them , ' i 'm pretty sure i 'm not going to change my mind			2
' " @entity24 , who is a @entity63 citizen , said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth does n't hasten his wife 's death sentence			1
in past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , @entity1 waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence			1
sharia law as practiced in @entity1 prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an expectant woman until two years after she gives birth			1
@entity29 sought comment from the @entity1 government and was directed to the justice ministry			1
a @entity29 request for an interview was denied , and the justice minister said they do n't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued			2
an attempt to contact @entity1 's foreign affairs minister for comment was unsuccessful			1
woman raised as @entity6 , husband says @entity13 , 27 , was arrested after @entity16 relatives accused her of renouncing her religion			1
their complaint alleged that she went missing for years , and her family was shocked to find out she married a @entity6 , according to her attorney , @entity97			1
@entity24 said he 'd never met the relatives who made the accusations			0
his wife , he said , was raised a @entity6 by her mother , an @entity102 orthodox , after her @entity16 father deserted the family when @entity13 was 6			2
" these people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared , " he said			0
at first , @entity13 was charged with adultery for marrying a @entity6			2
the apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a @entity6 , according to her husband			1
" the police originally called for the case to be dismissed , but these people went back and added another charge ... which is adultery , by saying she was their sister and a @entity16			0
it is illegal for a @entity16 woman to marry a @entity6 man , therefore we were brought before the court			1
" she 's been detained since january 17 , he said			0
in addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction , the couple also have to worry about their children , @entity24 said			0
" an illegitimate marriage does not result in legally recognized offspring , which means that my son and the new baby are no longer mine , " he said			0
@entity24 's physical condition makes the ordeal even harder			0
he uses a wheelchair and " totally depends " on @entity13 , according to her lawyer			0
" he can not live without her , " he said			0
@entity24 said he 's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added			0
" she 's in a bad mood , " he said of his wife			0
" more punishment in addition to the death sentence , the court sentenced @entity13 to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction			2
the court had warned her to renounce her @entity153 by may 15 , but she has steadfastly maintained she is a @entity6 and will remain so			1
@entity1 @entity155 speaker @entity154 said claims that she was raised as a @entity158 were untrue			2
she was raised in an @entity160 environment , and her brother , a muslim , filed the complaint against her , according to @entity154			0
' i 'll stand by her ' @entity24 said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court 's ruling being overturned			2
" i 'm hoping that , given the way people have come together around the world -- which i want to thank them for , " he said			0
" all the rights groups , all the broadcasters ... it 's looking like it had an effect			0
perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned			0
" but until it 's done , the mother of his children has his support			0
" i 'm standing by her to end			0
whatever she wants , i 'll stand by her , " he said			0
worldwide condemnation rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide have condemned the verdict			2
the ruling also created shock waves in @entity1 , where activists are defying the government and criticizing what they consider an overly harsh implementation and interpretation of @entity160 " the fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice , and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion , is abhorrent and should never be even considered , " said @entity198 , @entity199 's @entity1 researcher			1
foreign embassies in @entity43 , including those of the @entity63 , @entity208 and @entity209 , urged the @entity1 government to reverse course			1
there 's no timetable on when the judicial process will be over , but the couple is n't giving up			0
the appeals court 's ruling could come within the next week , their attorney says			1
until then , they 're grasping at small signs of hope			0
the last time @entity1 executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized @entity226 law .			2
