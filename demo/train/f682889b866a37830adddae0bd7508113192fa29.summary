how big of a threat is @entity1 really ? the @entity2 wants to find out and is deploying as many as 300 military advisers to @entity4 to assess the might of the @entity6 in @entity4 and @entity7			1
the jihadi group 's rash battlefield successes make it look extremely fierce			0
@entity1 militants have surged from the border with @entity7 to blitz major cities in @entity4 's northern @entity14 region , taking @entity15 and @entity16 , then moving quickly south			1
hundreds of thousands of civilians fled from their path , creating a new refugee crisis			0
they have advanced on @entity21 , just north of @entity22 , and are threatening to attack the capital			0
the @entity25 administration has said there will be no more @entity28 boots on the ground after the drawdown of all @entity28 troops -- tens of thousands of them			1
it 's up to the advisers to help @entity4 security forces vanquish @entity1 on their own			1
@entity36 officials have said little about what they 'll actually be doing , and expert opinions on that and on whether they should be in @entity4 at all are split			1
who are they ? they are high - ranking officers			0
they are @entity44 and @entity45 , said retired @entity47 sgt. @entity46			0
@entity46 , who scrapped through the brutal battle for @entity49 during the @entity4 war , thinks the term " adviser " is misplaced			1
" it is political semantics , " he said			0
" we are calling them adviser now ... instead of combat troops or boots on the ground , " he said			2
" they are the most elite fighters we have , " he added			0
" so , if they are n't going to be combat troops , i 'm not quite sure who the president is going to refer to as combat troops			2
" where will they be ? " they 'll be sitting in offices , not out on the front lines , and they 'll be looking at the maps , " said retired lt. col. @entity67			2
" so , they 're sort of holed up , giving advice , " he said			0
it would be unwise to put them on the front lines , where @entity1 could capture them			1
how will they work ? the plan is for the advisers to divide into small teams of about a dozen each and partner with @entity4 to form joint operation centers , senior administration officials said			1
what will they do ? their job will be to gather intelligence , in case president @entity25 decides to pull the trigger on airstrikes , a possibility he 's weighing			2
the advisers will also pass on intelligence to @entity4 forces , said retired lt. gen. @entity96 , who commanded @entity28 forces during operation @entity98			1
@entity22 tense as military seeks to halt @entity1 militants ' advance should they be there ? that depends on whom you ask			1
col. @entity108 says no. he says it 's a largely meaningless gesture			0
" they 'll be at risk , " he said			0
he says he thinks sending them was the least bad of a list of bad options presented to the president , who felt he had to do something			0
the @entity28 has to push back against @entity1 , he said			1
how dangerous are the militants ? @entity108 calls them " semi-illiteral ( illiterate ) thugs driving around in pickup trucks with machine guns			0
" they wo n't pose a military threat to the @entity28 , he said			0
" they 're occupied with decapitating @entity125 and trying to establish an @entity127 state in vast open stretches of empty , irrelevant desert			0
" picking up on @entity108 's term , @entity117 said that " @entity132 ( illiterate ) thugs " have struck the @entity28 before and could come again			0
" we ca n't allow that to occur any more than it is right now in @entity4 , " he said			1
the group has shown signs of sophistication , publishing complex reports on its finances			0
it has recruited fighters from multiple countries and bonded with professional ex-members of former @entity4 leader @entity146 's armed forces			1
and @entity14 tribal leaders have also joined their ranks			0
@entity1 also holds much of the northernmost region of @entity7			1
@entity150 : @entity28 would communicate with @entity151 , not work with it , against @entity1 will the advisers ' presence help ? that 's yet to be seen			1
@entity25 has said that his goal is to prevent @entity4 from becoming a haven for terrorists			2
some have criticized him for not leaving a residual force in the country to prevent the type of invasion @entity1 has mounted			2
but @entity25 is quick to point out @entity4 's role in that choice by not protecting @entity28 troops from @entity4 's justice system in the event of bloodshed			1
" the @entity4 government and prime minister ( @entity172 ) declined to provide us that immunity , " @entity25 said			2
retired sgt. @entity46 feels iffy about @entity4 soldiers ' commitment			2
when the @entity1 jihadis overran the northern cities , many @entity4 troops put up little resistance and fled			1
" i had friends over there who had the exact opposite experience where over 50 % of a unit would desert at a given time and a firefight would happen and they would drop their rifles and run			0
" opinion : @entity190 's amazing chutzpah on @entity4 transcript : @entity25 's remarks on @entity28 response to @entity4 crisis current fighting pushes @entity4 refugee population past 1 million			2

the @entity2 wants advisers to assess the dangers @entity1 poses
they will also support @entity4 troops by forming joint operation centers
experts are split on what they will actually do -- gather intel in offices or advise troops *closely*
they also disagree on whether or not they should go at all
