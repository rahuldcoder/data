assesses the strengths of his soon - to - be opponent , @entity6 ( played by @entity4 )			0
" you 're fast , and you like pain , " he says			0
" you eat it like candy			0
i 've seen a few cases like that in my time			0
the more they get hurt , the more dangerous they become			0
" that scene comes to mind whenever someone asks me what they should make of @entity22			1
who is he ? and what 's he up to ? they put those questions to me because i 've known @entity22 for a dozen years , since he was an anonymous lawyer toiling in the bureaucracy of the @entity28			1
and -- despite what may be the most tumultuous and colorful 10 months for a freshman legislator in the history of the @entity32 -- i 'm proud to call him a friend			1
for some of my readers , this seems an odd confession			0
after all , we 're talking about the most hated politician in @entity41			0
keep in mind that much of the hate being directed at the junior senator from @entity45 is coming from other politicians			1
@entity22 : @entity48 ' new bogeyman in fact , recently , an adviser to sen. @entity50 told @entity52 that the @entity55 " f * * * ing hates @entity22			1
" @entity56 do n't like the 42 - year - old because he makes them look bad and they ca n't control him			2
democrats do n't like him because his jabs sting and he wo n't back down			2
@entity22 does n't seem to be losing any sleep			1
the more he gets attacked , the stronger he 'll become -- and the more determined			0
it 's not just because he 'll get more popular with folks at the grass roots			2
for those who are convinced that @entity66 is broken and that corrupt lawmakers are serve their own interests while fooling constituents into thinking they 're serving them , @entity22 is a refreshing break from the ordinary			1
it 's the way @entity22 is wired			1
before entering the @entity32 , he argued for a living and was good enough at it to make a handsome living while building a reputation as one of the best constitutional lawyers			1
@entity81 @entity80 , no conservative , told the @entity83 that @entity22 was " off - the - charts brilliant			1
" @entity22 has been named by @entity41 lawyer magazine as one of the @entity87 under 45 in @entity41 in the country			1
in his 30s , he argued nine cases before the @entity90 and won several of them			0
whenever he is challenged , his energy level goes up , his backbone stiffens , and his wits sharpen			0
from that point , it 's game on			2
@entity22 does n't care about being popular or part of the in - crowd			1
he 's comfortable with conflict , and sometimes he even seems like a glutton for punishment			2
he ca n't be intimidated or scared off			2
he does n't care if other senators isolate him , ignore him or attack him			2
he does n't care if they let him into their club			1
so they have no power over him			0
not that his fellow senators have n't tried , unsuccessfully , to beat him into submission			2
they gave it a go last week at a closed - door lunch meeting in the @entity32 's @entity113			1
according to senators who attended the meeting , and who spoke anonymously to @entity119 and the @entity120 , one @entity55 senator after another berated @entity22 for -- as they saw it -- causing the government shutdown without a plan to end it			1
opinion : goodbye to the strategy @entity56 knew was a fantasy at one point , sen. @entity128 of @entity129 -- who is one of the @entity56 senators targeted for defeat by the @entity132 , an outside group that aims to punish those who did not fight the good fight against @entity135 -- asked the @entity45 senator whether he would publicly renounce the attacks			1
@entity22 's response , according to someone who was in the room , was short and sweet			1
" i will not , " he said			0
as he sees it , this is his colleagues ' problem , which they brought upon themselves by breaking promises and straying from principles			0
it 's not his job to save them			2
as one senator told the @entity120 , @entity22 's refusal to renounce the attacks on his colleagues " just started a lynch mob			1
" who knew the @entity56 senators still had some passion left in them , at least when re-election is at stake ? one senator who attended the meeting told @entity119 , " i just wish the 35 @entity163 members that have bought the snake oil that was sold could witness what was witnessed today at lunch			2
" notice that the unnamed senator -- a real profile in courage -- was n't so anxious for the proceedings to be witnessed by the scores of conservative voters outside of @entity66 who side with @entity22			1
for the @entity56 establishment , transparency is a concept that is best not carried too far			0
that hypocrisy from @entity56 sticks in my craw			0
i believe that the shutdown was the right thing to do and that defunding , or at least delaying , @entity135 is the necessary thing to do			1
opinion : obstructing government , from @entity186 to @entity22 it 's not ready for @entity41 , and @entity41 is not ready for it			1
the arguments coming from @entity163 @entity56 are more persuasive than the ones coming from the @entity163			0
i believe that @entity190 hurt his credibility by continuing to provide members of @entity193 and their staffs subsidies to purchase coverage and by agreeing to a delay in the mandate to provide insurance to those employers who are not already in compliance with the law			0
this is a spectacle that resembles employees who work in a restaurant vowing never to eat there			0
it 's no wonder the public is skeptical			0
the fact that i believe all this has nothing to do with @entity22			1
i got here all by myself			0
besides , i do n't put stock in the popular media narrative that @entity22 is singlehandedly responsible for shutting down the government			1
that 's just smoke from @entity48 and the @entity56 establishment			0
scores of @entity55 lawmakers raised money by promising to repeal @entity135			1
and then as soon as they got to @entity66 , they settled into their offices and did n't lift a finger to defund the program			1
in fact , they went on the attack against the one guy who led the fight to do just that			0
of course , this double talk blew up in their faces			0
what did they expect ? @entity193 is broken , but it was that way long before @entity22 got there			1
my friend draws his staying power from the belief that he 's right			0
as unpopular as he is within the @entity243 , he is keenly aware that -- in the heartland and across the country -- his stance in defiance of @entity135 , and his willingness to rock the political boat , have transformed him into a rock star			2
he has lost the support of many , if not all , his @entity32 colleagues			2
but , judging from what you hear on talk radio and right - wing blogs , he is winning the loyalty and respect of many average @entity41			0
and , in politics , that can carry you far			0
@entity22 will continue to be attacked			2
and like a fictional prizefighter , the more that others try to hurt him , the more dangerous he 'll become			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			2

@entity265 says @entity22 has shaken up @entity66
he says @entity22 , a smart and able lawyer , should n't be *underestimated*
@entity265 : @entity22 is n't worried about making friends and being part of the @entity32 club
he says the @entity45 senator 's *critique* of @entity135 is right on the money
