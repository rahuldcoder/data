" @entity2 then handed the @entity6 trophy to @entity4 president @entity11 , who flew in for the announcement			1

" he promised @entity4 " will now , with great pride , do its homework			2
" and , he added , " if everything works out well , we will win once again a @entity6			2
" @entity4 was the only candidate to pitch to host football 's global showpiece after @entity30 rivals @entity28 pulled out of the running in april			1
however , @entity4 had been told by @entity3 it was n't guaranteed the tournament simply because it was the only candidate , saying it had to provide a solid bid package			1
@entity2 said the lack of competition from other @entity30 nations was one reason behind @entity3 's decision monday to do away with the rotation system that gave each continent a turn at hosting the @entity6			1
the decision takes effect with the 2018 tournament			0
" we are a civilized nation , a nation that is going through an excellent phase , and we have got everything prepared to receive adequately the honor to organize an excellent @entity6 , " @entity46 president @entity45 said			2
@entity4 sports minister @entity52 , national team coach @entity53 , veteran striker @entity55 and renowned author @entity56 were among those making the trip to @entity0 -- and the final decision was made by @entity3 's executive committee after a 30 - minute presentation			1
" of course , dreams demand hard work and we @entity4 are ready to face this task , " @entity56 said			2
" all the countries in the world have two teams -- the national squad and the @entity4 squad			2
" @entity4 hosted the @entity6 once before , 57 years ago			1
since launching its bid for 2014 , @entity4 has emphasized why the country needs the @entity6 , much more than what it has to offer the tournament			1
" over the next few years we will have a consistent influx of investments			0
the @entity6 will enable @entity4 to have a modern infrastructure , " @entity45 said			1
" in social terms will be very beneficial			0

" the @entity6 goes far beyond a mere sporting event			0
it 's going to be an interesting tool to promote social transformation			0
" tuesday 's presentation was smoother than the one in july , which underlined @entity4 's status as a developing nation with repeated images of its car factories and dry statistics			0
@entity2 had recently questioned @entity4 's infrastructure and bid plans , but @entity3 said last week that a stadium - inspection trip in august showed the country could put on " an exceptional " tournament			1
however , there have been delays in hosting some major events , problems with violence in the streets and the public transportation system in the country is often overloaded			0
the @entity4 soccer confederation estimates that the construction and remodeling of stadiums will require an investment of $ 1.1 billion , though that could vary significantly depending on the cities chosen to host games			2
@entity4 is home to 10 of the world 's largest football stadiums , including the famous maracana where more than 200,000 fans saw the home side lose 2 - 1 to @entity117 in the 1950 @entity6 final			1
renovations have since reduced its capacity to 95,000 seats , with thousands more standing			0
