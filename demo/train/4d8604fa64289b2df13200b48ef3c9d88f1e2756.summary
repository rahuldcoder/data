editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- two men stand in the yard of a @entity21 jail , facing the camera			0
one looks straight into the lens while the other looks away			0
they are on trial for poaching and could be sharing a cell for the next 20 years if convicted			0
@entity28 and @entity31 have been documenting the illegal trade of endangered animals in @entity34 for more than ten years , covering its dealers , stockpiles , trafficking routes and markets			1
they knows that poachers are but a small part of a much bigger contraband industry that is centuries old			0
" a poacher who kills a rhino and removes its horn in @entity46 gets $ 350 , " @entity28 explains			1
" by the time it reaches @entity50 , the horn is worth about $ 95,600 per killogram			0
" money fuels illegal animal trade , as it does any other form of smuggling , but the demand and value of these animals is built upon false beliefs and superstition			1
@entity61 horns have no medicinal purpose , but myths about their effect on health and potency have pushed their value to more than five times the price of gold in black markets			0
animal trade thrives on novelty and on the belief that exotic animals exude certain powers			1
more and more people are becoming aware of the myths , but sellers are also adapting			0
as @entity28 explains , porous rhino horns are now often soaked in @entity78 before they reach the market			1
see the rest of @entity81 : @entity28 at @entity5 the exact size of that market is impossible to figure out , but experts estimate that its value is somewhere in the hundreds of millions of dollars			1
legal global wildlife trade has doubled since the 1990s , and the evidence is nothing short of disheartening : more than 100 million sharks are killed each year , elephants have evolved to have shorter tusks because of poaching , and there are more @entity96 tigers in @entity97 than in the bay of @entity99			2
the trade pandemic is only made worse by the shortage of animal specialists at checkpoints			2
" the problem seems insurmountable , " @entity28 said , " but one way of curbing rampant killing is to educate future generations			1
" @entity28 does not think of himself as an animal activist , but rather talks about exposing a subculture of society and documenting the story of what happens to these animals			1
he hopes his work will raise public and political awareness about this issue and has said that his ultimate goal is to educate the developing world			1
@entity28 and @entity31 ' decade - long project will culminate with the publication of " @entity122 " later this year			2
the book was made possible by the crowd - funding site @entity125 and will include an introduction by journalist @entity31 .			0
