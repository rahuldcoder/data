" further details about @entity3 's reported order were n't immediately available			0
but a withdrawal may ease tensions simmering since @entity4 annexed @entity12 's @entity30 peninsula of @entity31 this month -- a move that has led to the worst @entity34 relations since the @entity35			1
earlier monday , @entity4 media reported that one @entity4 infantry battalion was being moved from the border area to its base deeper into @entity4			0

@entity88 told @entity89 that progress depended on a @entity4 troop pullback from @entity12 's borders but no breakthrough was announced			1

" at some border districts the troops are withdrawn , in others they approach the border , " he said			0
" we are concerned about this movement of the army			0
" @entity74 official : ' too soon ' to discern @entity4 intentions before @entity2 's announcement , a @entity74 official said monday it was too soon to conclude whether @entity4 was moving its troops away from the @entity12 border			1

" we have nothing to back that up one way or the other so far , " the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity			0
barring any significant withdrawal from the border , the @entity4 are positioned " in a way ( that ) they could conduct a swift movement into @entity12 , " the official said			2
@entity4 prime minister in @entity31 @entity57 arrived in @entity31 's capital , @entity162 , for talks monday on social and economic development			1
