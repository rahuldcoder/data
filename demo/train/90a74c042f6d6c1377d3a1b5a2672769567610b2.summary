-- the @entity2 secretary of defense says any agreement reached that keeps @entity2 troops in @entity6 past an end - of - the - year deadline to withdraw must include immunity from @entity6 prosecution			1
" if they want the benefits of what we can provide , if they want the assistance , if they want the training , if they want the operational skills that we can provide , then i think they have to understand that they 've got to give us some protections in that process , " @entity10 told sailors friday during a visit to @entity13 , @entity14 , home of the @entity15			1
@entity10 's statement follows news this week that @entity6 's top political leadership agreed that a number of @entity2 troops should remain in the country to aid in training and security , though said it was " unnecessary " to grant @entity2 forces legal immunity			1
@entity10 made the comments while answering a question from a sailor , who inquired about @entity6 refusing to grant legal immunity to @entity2 forces and what it might mean for the future role of the @entity2 military in @entity6			1
" this is obviously a very pertinent question right now as we try to deal with the issue of whether or not we 'll have a future presence in @entity6 , " @entity10 said , according to a transcript released by the @entity49			0
the defense secretary said negotiations were ongoing between @entity6 's political leadership , @entity2 ambassador @entity57 and gen. @entity58 , commander of @entity2 forces in @entity6			1
@entity10 said the meetings include discussions about what are the rights of @entity2 troops and what will be required in order for those troops to assist @entity6 forces in the future			1
" if you 're going to play a large role in dealing with another country where it requires , as i said , a large group of troops to be on the ground and to be dealing with that country , i want to make damn sure that you 're protected , " @entity10 told the sailors			0
the @entity2 has grown increasingly frustrated with the pace of the negotiations , which have dragged well past an @entity6 self - imposed august deadline to decide whether to keep troops			2
the negotiations have been strained following @entity84 ' release of a diplomatic cable that alleged @entity6 civilians , including children , were killed in a 2006 raid by @entity2 troops rather than in an airstrike as initially reported by the @entity2 military			1
the @entity49 dismissed the cable from @entity93 investigator @entity92 to @entity2 officials , saying it had investigated the claims and found there was no merit			0
shortly after the @entity84 cable gained attention in news reports in september by @entity102 , @entity6 prime minister @entity98 ordered an investigation into the deaths outside of @entity105			0
@entity2 officials have long said they believe @entity6 may need help with training , counterterrorism , air defense , command and control and intelligence operations			2
any @entity2 troops remaining to do those jobs might also need additional security forces			2
the prospect of @entity2 troops staying beyond the end of the year sits uncomfortably with many @entity6 , who have routinely questioned @entity2 motives following the 2003 @entity2 - led invasion that toppled @entity121			1
radical anti-american cleric @entity122 , whose @entity124 political party is closely aligned with @entity98 , has vowed to escalate armed resistance if the @entity2 military does not leave as scheduled , a move that could destabilize the country should his militia repeat the bloody battles it waged against @entity2 and @entity6 forces during the height of violence			2
gen. @entity134 , the new army chief of staff , said last month there would be risks in leaving a large force of @entity2 troops in @entity6			1
a large @entity2 force , he said , could provoke new claims of @entity2 occupation and distract from efforts to develop the @entity6 military 's abilities			0
he would not comment directly on reports that the @entity147 administration had decided to leave between 3,000 and 5,000 troops , should they be requested by @entity6			0
@entity134 , who served as the top @entity2 commander in @entity6 , said training of @entity6 security forces was not complete			0
" we need to probably be there to assist them at certain levels for a while , " he said last month in a question - and - answer session with journalists at the @entity49			0
@entity10 's visit to the @entity13 base was part of a trip that has taken him to @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 , where he met with @entity166 officials			0
@entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
