" we believe there is a great potential for us to invest in east @entity5 and ( we 're ) looking forward to further cooperation , " @entity73 said			0
the @entity75 claims the construction could create at least 10,000 jobs locally as " large quantities of local inputs such as steel , cement , aggregates , electricity generation and electricity transmission pylons and cables , roofing materials , glass are required from local industries			0
