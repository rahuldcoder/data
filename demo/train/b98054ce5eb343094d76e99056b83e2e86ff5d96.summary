@entity0 -- just seven days after the world woke up to the shock of yet another @entity6 police brutality scandal , the story has already moved to the inside pages of newspapers			1
here in @entity6 we are not much surprised by the brutal death of @entity11 , the taxi driver who was allegedly dragged by a police van to his death last week			1
the only surprise is that @entity6 -- and knowledgeable observers of the country -- were surprised by this outrage at all			1
@entity20 's tragic death is merely the latest in a long and growing list of innocents suspected of being perpetrated by our police			1
@entity20 's name is preceded by others that reflect the re-militarization of the @entity29 over the past four years , and the consequences of that process			0
we remember very well , here , the name @entity33			0
he was three years old when police shot him dead in 2009 , allegedly because the policeman thought the toddler was carrying a gun			1
he was just playing with a piece of iron pipe in a settlement where toys are hard to come by			1
then there was the activist and teacher @entity44 : he ran to stop policemen abusing an old man			0
eleven of them beat him to death with batons in front of television cameras and shot him with rubber bullets at point - blank range			1
and so it goes on			0
last august 34 striking mineworkers at @entity58 were mowed down in under 30 minutes by police , who later bizarrely charged their surviving comrades with murder of their own colleagues			2
as if that was not enough , the commissioner of police later told her members that they should not feel sorry for what had happened			2
more than 13 of the marikana dead were shot in the back			2
the reason for the increase in cases of police brutality in @entity6 is not hard to find			1
it goes straight to the heart of the administration of president @entity78 , which since its inauguration in may 2009 has beaten the drum of " tough action " against the admittedly high and rampant crime in our country			1
@entity6 fury over shooting tests @entity78 in 1994 the @entity89 administration actively started demilitarizing the apartheid police force			1
military ranks were abandoned , and the word service was added to the police 's name to make it the @entity29			2
civilians were encouraged to be more active in police structures , with community policing becoming the norm			2
a process of re-militarization of the police started , coupled with tough talk from politicians and police top brass			1
@entity78 's administration was particularly enamored with the word " bastard			1
" " we can not say to the police , retreat			2
we can not say to @entity6 , despair			1
our job is to give people hope			0
hard - nut to crack , incorrigible bastards , " said then - deputy police minister @entity116 in 2009			1
he was echoing words used by the justice minister , @entity119 , who had said the year before : " you must kill the bastards if they threaten you or the community			2
you must not worry about the regulations			0
your responsibility is to serve and protect			0
" in the period since 2009 military nomenclature has returned to the @entity29			0
the police commissioner now carries the rank of general			2
crack units have been established , and the para-military unit " @entity132 " is notorious for its brutality in enforcing the law in townships			2
victims have provided numerous footage of their brutality , in one case beating up restaurant patrons without any provocation , but no action has been taken			2
police brutality is rarely punished in @entity6			1
@entity145 newspaper reports that in the 2011/12 financial year 720 deaths allegedly at the hands of police were investigated by the @entity149			1
only five officers were dismissed and 13 convicted of crimes during that period			0
in the 2008/09 financial year 912 deaths at the hands of police were investigated			2
just three officers were dismissed			0
it is not just that the police do not want to act			0
as demonstrated by the sheer buffoonery of the investigation carried out by @entity160 -- the investigating officer in the @entity163 case and himself facing seven charges of murder for shooting at a taxi with seven passengers in it -- our police services are terrible at investigation			1
out of 65,000 sexual offences reported every year in @entity6 in recent times , the police are fortunate to record more than 4,000 convictions			1
it is almost just not worth reporting the crime			0
so where does that leave us , a country still reeling from international coverage of @entity163 ' shooting of an innocent woman in his own bathroom ? where does all this rape , murder and brutality come from ? many point to apartheid , others to the gun and violent culture of that system			0
others point to its effects : the dehumanization of the black man and the dehumanization of the white man too			0
the sociologists are kept busy with all this -- how does one explain an international athlete living in a secure estate sleeping with a gun by his bedside and a rifle at his windowsill ? how does one explain a rape every four minutes ? the here and now is that we are not doing enough to push back against our historical problems			1
men are not being taught in schools and communities that rape is wrong			0
all this points to one thing : you will be hearing of another violent , police or gun - related or rape - related , scandal out of @entity6 before long			1
after all , @entity78 has already promised tough action against protesters this year			1
our police are ready , and waiting , to " shoot to kill			0
" editor 's note : @entity6 's acting police minister has said tough action will be taken against those involved in the death of @entity11 and called for a speedy independent investigation			1
@entity235 , a spokesman for the @entity149 ( @entity149 ) , an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police , said officers who carry out crimes do not reflect the police service as a whole			0
" there are many other officers who are dedicated , who uphold the law and arrest criminals all the time , " he said			0
@entity247 also said the statistics cited by the @entity145 were misleading when viewed out of context			0
not all of the 720 deaths reported in 2011/2012 were caused by police action , he said			0
some were due to natural causes or injuries sustained before arrest			0
" in fact , the number of deaths in custody as well as deaths as a result of police action have been declining significantly over the last four years			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			0
