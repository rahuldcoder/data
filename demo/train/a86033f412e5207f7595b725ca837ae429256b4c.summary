-- the gun lobby is " ginning up " fears the federal government will use the @entity5 shooting tragedy , exactly one month ago , to seize @entity7 ' guns , president @entity1 said monday			1
at least part of the frenzy is little more than marketing , he implied			0
" it 's certainly good for business , " the president said , responding to a question about a spike in weapons sales and applications for background checks after the massacre at @entity18 's @entity5 left 27 people dead , 20 of them children			1
" part of the challenge we confront is that even the slightest hint of some sensible , responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow , ' here it comes , everybody 's guns are going to be taken away , ' " @entity1 said			1
read more : @entity5 searches for answers a month later this week , the president is reviewing recommendations from a task force led by vice president @entity38 looking into ways to curb gun violence			1
@entity1 set up the group after december 's carnage in @entity5 and demanded reform ideas by this month			1
@entity1 said he expects to have a fuller presentation later in the week " to give people some specifics about what i think we need to do , " he told reporters monday			1
while the final recommendations have not been made public , @entity38 has said he 's found widespread support for universal background checks and restrictions on the sale of high capacity magazines , which gun - control advocates believe contribute to more bloodshed at mass shootings			1
@entity1 said he backs such measures as well as renewing the @entity62 - era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004			1
passing any legislation may not be easy : the influential @entity64 , among other gun rights groups , has vowed to fight any new gun restrictions -- like an assault weapon ban , which the group 's president @entity68 predicted sunday would n't make it through @entity71 -- tooth and nail			1
yet , as he weighs options , @entity1 said politics is n't his first concern			1
" my starting point is to focus on what makes sense , what works , what should we be doing to make sure our children are safe , " he told reporters			0
" i think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the @entity86			0
" ' this is about the safety of the public ' gun control advocates , gun violence victims , the @entity64 , video game makers and others have met with the @entity38 - led task force , with their conversations ranging from the capacity of ammunition magazines to portrayals of violence in the media			1
the vice president met monday with congressional democrats , talks that are " part of a larger outreach effort that will involve other members of @entity71 , " a source familiar with the meeting told @entity0			0
in addition to new gun restrictions , the package proposed by @entity1 may include mental health provisions that could garner wider support			1
some initiatives -- like how the government tracks how weapons fall into criminals ' hands -- could be accomplished by executive order , @entity1 said			1
yet other measures would require approval of a @entity71 that , on many issues , has been hard - pressed to get anything accomplished -- even though the momentum to act in some way , be it by clamping down on guns or putting armed guards in schools , as the @entity64 has proposed -- is undeniable			1
@entity129 , a former @entity130 pilot and astronaut whose wife , then - rep. @entity132 , survived a 2011 mass shooting that left six dead , said he and his wife both own guns and support the @entity86			0
yet the couple is adamant that more must be done to curb gun violence , touting measures like banning high - capacity magazines and having universal background checks , which @entity129 said a vast majority of the @entity64 's 4.2 million members support			1
decisive action or imagery : gun control and the power of political symbolism " this is n't really about the @entity86 , " said @entity129 , who has formed a political action committee intent on pursuing reforms			2
" this is about gun safety , and it 's about the safety of the public			1
" the retired @entity130 captain told @entity0 he believes the debate can produce " common sense solutions to this very serious problem			0
" people around the country are demanding nothing less in the wake of the @entity5 shooting , @entity161 mayor @entity160 said			1
he said monday that more than 1 million people have signed a petition backed by his group , @entity169			2
" for many @entity7 , this is the straw that broke the camel 's back , " he said about the @entity18 school carnage			2
@entity175 appears to support the contention			0
poll shows public dissatisfied with gun laws a new @entity180 poll released monday shows 38 % of @entity7 are dissatisfied with current gun laws and support stricter proposals			2
that is a 13 percentage point jump from a year ago			0
the shift is most marked among men			0
the poll revealed a 17 percent increase in support for stricter gun control laws among men , compared to 10 percentage points for women			2
that may be because polling has shown women already tend to be more supportive of gun control legislation			2
the increase spanned the partisan divide , but it was strongest with @entity201 , 64 percent of whom said they favor additional regulations			2
that 's up 22 percentage points from last year , @entity180 reported			2
among @entity207 , support rose by 12 percentage points , though that still only works out to 18 percent overall			0
the poll of 1,011 adults was conducted january 7 - 10 and has a sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points			0
@entity216 background check : what does it mean ? new gun violence proposal in @entity220 @entity18 gov. @entity221 wrote @entity38 , and told @entity0 , that federal gun control action is imperative , noting there 's little to stop would - be criminals from taking advantage of relatively lax laws in one state and transporting guns around the country			1
while this view is widely shared among gun control supporters , that has n't stopped some of them from taking actions on the state level			2
speaking at a @entity239 summit on reducing gun violence attended by @entity241 , @entity220 gov. @entity237 said he will debut gun control proposals this week that would ban military style assault weapons and limit the size of magazines and introduce a " common - sense licensing requirement for handguns that respects the traditions of hunters and sportsmen			1
" the proposals would also include mental health reforms , @entity237 said			0
those include additional funds for treatment and efforts to detect and head off serious mental illness sooner			0
the plan also calls for investments in school safety , including a center to study ways to improve security at schools			2
he said the issue is n't a partisan one , but rather a public health issue , and said it " makes no sense to blame every factor but guns			0
" " there may be no way to completely prevent the next @entity5 tragedy , " he said			0
" but again , perhaps there is			0
" @entity276 passes new gun regulations in @entity161 -- where a week ago , @entity201 gov. @entity278 spelled out tough new gun control proposals -- the state @entity276 passed a series of new gun regulations in a 43 - 18 vote monday night			1
the bill now goes to the state assembly			2
@entity278 called for an assault weapons ban , background checks for people who purchase guns in private transactions and a ban on high - capacity magazines			0
the tentative deal would include a statewide assault weapons registry and add a uniform licensing standard across the state -- altering the current system , in which each county or municipality sets a standard -- a state @entity276 source said monday			1
magazines could have no more than seven bullets under the would - be agreement , according to the source , among other provisions			0
discussions had percolated about crafting a law , similar to one in @entity311 , that allows mental health professionals to inform law enforcement if they believe their patient could pose a threat to themselves or others , the source said			0
law enforcement authorities may then revoke the patient 's license to carry a firearm and prevent them from having a gun for at least six months			1
one month since shooting meanwhile , bitter memories of the tragedy that spurred such proposals remains raw , especially in western @entity18			0
the one - month anniversary of the shooting went largely unmarked in any formal way , save for a moment of silence at a news conference held by a community group , " @entity334 , " formed after the killings to find a solution to gun violence			1
@entity338 , whose son @entity339 was among the children killed in the shooting , was among several parents who spoke			0
" i still find myself reaching for @entity339 's hand to walk through a car parking lot , or expecting him to crawl into bed beside me for early morning cuddles before we get ready for school , " she said , her voice quavering			2
" it is so hard to believe he is gone			0
" others spoke of their resolve to ensure such violence ends			0
" we refuse to be remembered only for our loss , " group co-founder @entity354 said			0
" we want the @entity5 to be recalled as the turning point when we brought our community , and communities across the nation , together and set a real course for change			0
" @entity5 opens eyes to other gun violence against young people @entity0 's @entity365 , @entity366 , @entity367 , @entity368 and @entity369 contributed to this report .			1
