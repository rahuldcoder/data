@entity0 has one of the top computer science schools in the country			1
except maybe not on monday			0
that 's when the school 's admissions office mistakenly sent out acceptance emails to 800 rejected applicants for the university 's master 's program in computer science			1

@entity0 issued a statement apologizing for the fiasco			2
" this error was the result of serious mistakes in our process for generating acceptance letters , " the university 's @entity28 said			2
