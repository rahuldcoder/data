-- when @entity3 , a @entity4 student at the @entity5 , posted a @entity6 about the sexual harassment she says she experienced during a study abroad trip in @entity9 , the response was overwhelming			1
@entity3 ' story , which is now the most - viewed @entity6 of all time , spawned thousands of impassioned comments and responses , many from women who live in @entity9 or who had traveled there and who wished to share their own experiences			1
sexual harassment in @entity9 : ' the story you never wanted to hear ' " this is a side of @entity9 that is a reality to most young women who reside here -- or for that matter travel here , " said @entity22 , 27 , from @entity23 in @entity9			1
" i wish i could take your pain away , " said @entity30 , 22 , from @entity31			2
sexual harassment remains a pervasive problem in @entity9 society			1
often referred to by the euphemism " eve - teasing , " a 2011 survey supported by @entity37 found 95 % of females in @entity41 said they felt unsafe in public places			2
earlier this year the country introduced stricter anti-rape laws following the fatal gang rape of a young woman in @entity41 , but gender inequality remains embedded within @entity9 society			1
as reports of another gang rape emerged in the @entity9 city of @entity31 on friday , the issue remains as pertinent as ever			1
while @entity3 has garnered attention for speaking up about her experience , she 's not alone			1
four women with connections to @entity9 shared their own experiences , whether they felt it fair to single out @entity9 on the issue , and how best to tackle the problem			1
please note that @entity0 can not independently verify the incidents described below			1
@entity62 , 27 , business development professional from @entity64 when i read @entity3 ' article i was ashamed of my country ( for the first time )			1
but i realized that i can not sit in my comfortable space and watch people tear my country down			2
almost every woman who grows up in @entity9 has been subjected to some kind of sexual innuendos ... but for every man who can not control his libido and gives in to his over-crazed sexual drive , i can assure you that there will be 10 men who will fight for you and your dignity			1
keeping chivalry alive : men respond to @entity9 rape crisis in @entity85 , we say " @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 " ( translated : @entity90 , @entity91 , teacher , @entity92 )			1
the meaning of this adage is the greatest truth and is the order in which we offer reverence			0
this is the basic tenet in existence from time immemorial , and every man has been taught to place the womankind even above @entity92			2
@entity9 men know to treat their women with respect			1
and i can not tolerate your generalization that @entity9 men are bad			1
you can not blame the entire male population for the actions of few			0
in all the countries i have been to , i have been subjected to roving eyes and sexual overtures from men			0
i have been leered and heckled by cab drivers and pedestrians alike			0
even a middle - aged woman is not spared			0
let 's not be too dramatic here and accept that sexual crimes against women are a problem the world over			1
@entity125 , 22 , student in @entity4 , grew up in @entity31 born and raised in @entity9 , i moved to the @entity4 three years ago to pursue my undergraduate education			1
like @entity3 , i studied abroad in the fall of 2012			0
my chosen destination was @entity129			0
upon my return , i told family in @entity9 and friends from around the world exactly what they expected to hear			1
i told them i was in love -- in love with @entity129			0
i did indeed relish the experience of living in a country whose culture and language is so different from my own			0
how it feels to be a woman in @entity9 however , i fell short of mentioning the time i was harassed by a drunk man at the @entity148 , while numerous people simply stood and watched , the time i was groped by a man on a bus who threatened to follow me home , or the time i was actually followed back home from my afternoon run at @entity157 des @entity158			1
this , unfortunately , is a woman 's plight , wherever in the world she might be			2
although an @entity9 women who is expected to be used to the staring and teasing , i am not prepared			1
i am not prepared to look over my shoulder after sunset			0
i am not prepared to think twice before using public transport			0
i am not prepared for the reactions that my clothing might elicit			0
having lived in three of the world 's megacities , @entity31 , @entity129 and @entity172 , i have been equally unprepared wherever i might be , for the simple reason that i am a woman			2
the pervasiveness of sexual harassment is global			2
@entity176 , 25 , reporter from @entity23 a lot of us in @entity9 ... feel a collective responsibility for what happened to @entity3 and feel terrible for what 's happened to her			1
but i also think it is terribly unfair to turn every man in @entity9 into a monster			1
it also hurts to read comments where people urge others to stay away from this beautiful country			2
should solo female travelers avoid @entity9 ? as someone who lives here every day of her life , it hurts when someone says " if you have white skin , you should stay away from @entity9			1
" it 's this kind of racist bigotry we should try and overcome			2
unfortunately i have been groped at and harassed by men			0
i am a runner and every time i set out to run by myself , i make sure i have my phone with me and pepper spray in case men on the streets decide to harass the girl running in sweatpants ( i never wear my shorts on solo runs )			2
but that 's not what the country is all about			2
it 's a big nation that should not be generalized			2
in any city you will find millions talking different languages , following different cultures			0
you simply can not speak for all of them in one breath			0
it 's not possible in @entity9			1
i think sexual harassment is a global problem , and it 's something women have to live with every day of their lives			1
it 's unfortunately as bad as it gets in @entity9			1
i really do believe that there needs to be mass education to help change attitudes toward women			0
@entity230 , 21 , student from @entity31 reading line after line of @entity3 ' story filled me with an overwhelming sense of shame			2
i have been stared at , leered at , groped and followed by strangers for close to 11 years of my life			0
and yet , i feel ashamed before i feel indignant			0
i believe the poor treatment of women and their sexual objectification is endemic in @entity9 society today			1
children might be taught to treat women with respect in their classrooms , however , most of them go back home to see the exact opposite in implementation by members of their families			0
' she could have been me ' : @entity253 urged after @entity41 gang rape case it appears to be a fairly daunting and uphill task to go about educating a billion - plus population about the importance of proper treatment of women , and in a way that translates into meaningful change in the society			0
but it needs to happen			0
stricter laws would be an essential part of the solution			0
police apathy and in some cases , blatant disregard for the plight of the victims only encourages and empowers this disgusting behavior			0
i think it is most important for women to come out and speak about the issue			0
we have grown up being taught to remain silent about sexual abuse			0
i think one of the most significant changes one can bring about in this situation is to remove the shame attached to being a victim of sexual abuse			0
if we talk about it more , millions of women will draw strength from speaking the truth and will come closer to being liberated .			0
