-- to the @entity3 voters in the other 49 states , i sympathize with you			2
it must be painful to turn on every cable and broadcast network , read the websites and follow the blogs and realize that you mean absolutely nothing when it comes to choosing a @entity3 nominee for president of the @entity15			0
please , do n't even bother			0
@entity16 has it all under control , and what happens there , and in @entity21 , will settle the race once and for all			1
what a load of animal droppings on the @entity16 farm fields			1
conventional wisdom , which really means the opinions of the smart , politically savvy know - it - all sages in @entity30 , says that if you do n't win @entity16 or place high there , you wo n't be able to raise the money to continue , and you might as well go home and lick your wounds			1
remember when that was the standard talk in 2008 after then - sen. @entity37 won @entity16 ? the political elites said if he beat sen. @entity41 in @entity21 , the race was over			1
a lot of voters in the @entity21 were offended to hear that , especially women , and backed @entity46			1
as a result , those two fought it out for another five months in a grueling race for the @entity51 presidential nomination			0
it has always offended me that voters in the other states are seen as also - rans			2
and that 's the no. 1 reason why @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 threatened or successfully moved their primaries and caucuses : they wanted to matter , and not just accept what @entity16 and @entity21 gave them			1
no @entity3 candidate should entertain the notion of dropping out of the race based on what happens in @entity16 on tuesday night			1
why end it after one state ? i bet former @entity73 gov. @entity72 regrets dropping out after the @entity75 , @entity16 , straw poll , which rep. @entity76 won			1
was he having money issues ? sure			0
but so were @entity76 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
the latter two vaulted to the top of the polls based on debate performances			2
see , it paid to keep going			0
it 's true that @entity16 can be a game changer if you are not expected to win			1
it was a huge boost for @entity37 in 2008 , but for past @entity16 winners such as @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , it did n't lead to winning their respective party 's presidential nomination			1
now i doubt @entity97 , @entity98 or even @entity99 will slip up after tuesday night , but no one knows for sure			0
we 've seen a lot of crazy things happen in this race so far			2
so we might as well be prepared for the unpredictable			0
in fact , i find it hilarious that so many folks in the chattering class say it 's all about @entity16 , and @entity97 turns into @entity110 if he wins			1
yet if @entity98 wins , the results do n't matter			0
really ? so excuse me if i sound like a contrarian by refusing to buy the media hype of putting so much on @entity16			2
it 's one of 50 states			0
it 's the first , sure			0
but it sure as hell should n't be the last , or even next to last , for all of the candidates			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .			2

@entity121 *objects* to the notion that you have to take @entity16 to win
@entity121 : no candidate should drop out based on performance in @entity16 or @entity21
the *48* other states must not be dismissed , he says ; changes in fortunes happen
@entity16 boosted @entity37 , he says , but not winners @entity90 , @entity91 or @entity92
