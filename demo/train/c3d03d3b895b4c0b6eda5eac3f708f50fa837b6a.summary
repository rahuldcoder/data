@entity3 will probably not force votes on proposals meant to shine an unusually ugly spotlight on @entity9 sen. @entity8 's alleged past solicitation of prostitutes , a @entity2 @entity1 aide acknowledged to @entity11 tuesday			1
majority leader @entity12 , @entity13 , and other top @entity3 have been considering holding the votes in response to @entity8 's attempt to force a politically tough vote on whether to strip federal healthcare support from lawmakers and staff			1
the @entity2 aide said the @entity1 plan was hatched in response to years of mounting frustration with the @entity26 senator			1
among other things , @entity3 have been loudly floating an alternative amendment to strip federal healthcare contributions from any lawmaker found to have likely solicited prostitutes			1
they 've also considered a vote on an amendment stripping federal healthcare contributions from lawmakers whose actions more generally reflect poorly on @entity37 , as well as an amendment cutting off healthcare subsidies from any senator who votes for @entity8 's proposal			1
@entity8 was famously linked to the so - called " @entity42 " prostitution scandal in 2007			0
the conservative @entity44 admitted to committing a " very serious sin , " and won a second @entity2 term in 2010			0
as far as @entity3 are concerned , @entity8 was the one who first crossed a line by going after congressional staffers			2
" for senator @entity8 and his @entity44 allies to end the contribution for 16,000 hardworking federal employees -- even after years of accepting the subsidy themselves -- is hypocritical and mean - spirited , " @entity12 said on the @entity2 floor on tuesday			2
" if senator @entity8 opposes the employer contribution to congressional staffers , does he oppose it also for the 150 million other @entity57 whose employers help pay their health insurance premiums ? " @entity8 -- a fierce critic of president @entity61 's @entity60 -- caused an uproar on @entity63 when he first proposed to end federal contributions to healthcare coverage provided to lawmakers and legislative staffers			1
@entity8 's plan would save nearly $ 1 billion over the next decade , according to the non-partisan @entity69			1
under @entity60 regulations crafted by the administration , legislators and staffers will continue to receive federal healthcare contributions while participating in insurance exchanges set up under the law			2
but @entity8 says @entity78 politicians and staff should n't receive what he views as special subsidies denied to other @entity57			0
democrats -- quietly joined by a number of congressional @entity44 -- insist the federal government 's contribution to its employees ' health care is no different than the contribution provided by other large employers to millions of @entity57 in the private sector			0
" all that we are asking is that this group of individuals be treated the same as every other @entity57 with health insurance through their employment , " said @entity92 sen. @entity91 , the chamber 's no. 2 @entity93			0
" my fear is that this is n't the end of senator @entity8 's crusade against health insurance by employers			1
i think this is the first step			0
the next step could be to eliminate the employers ' contribution for health insurance across the board			0
" @entity8 's plan is " a step back in time , " @entity91 declared			1
@entity8 lashed back on @entity115 , writing , " so many employees will lose their employer contribution because of # @entity60			2
anyone think @ @entity120 deserves to be exempt ? " later , @entity12 told reporters he may allow a vote on @entity8 's proposal , which is virtually certain to be defeated			1
@entity8 then took to the @entity2 floor to praise reports of a possible resolution to the embarrassing showdown			2
it " certainly sounds like the discussion at the majority ( @entity1 ) lunch today was , let 's just say , more appropriate and more productive than the discussion " last week , @entity8 said			0
but " what is good for @entity57 is good for @entity78 , " he added			0
" the rule for @entity57 should certainly be the rule for those who have the particular honor and responsibility to help govern			0
and that should be the case across the board			0
" last week , @entity8 argued that @entity12 and other @entity3 , by shining an uncomfortable spotlight on his past , engaged in unacceptable congressional behavior			1
on friday , he requested an ethics investigation into whether @entity12 , sen. @entity146 , @entity147 , and their staff violated @entity2 rules by publicly proposing legislation which " ties members ' personal healthcare benefits to their performance of specific acts and votes			2
" " this is attempted bribery , and the exact sort of behavior that the @entity160 has previously condemned , " @entity8 wrote			0
@entity3 dismissed @entity8 's accusation , calling it baseless .			1

@entity3 backing off votes meant to embarrass sen. @entity8 , @entity26
votes would have highlighted @entity8 's alleged past *involvement* with a prostitute
votes were possible response to @entity8 plan to strip healthcare contributions from lawmakers , aides
@entity2 may still hold vote on @entity8 plan , which is considered likely to lose
