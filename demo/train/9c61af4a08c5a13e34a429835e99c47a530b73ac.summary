-- i am the mother of three amazing children			0
before having children , i was a firm believer that guns were dangerous			1
but i did nothing to educate myself about guns or gun safety			1
i feared the unknown and the danger guns seemed to possess			1
but after 10 years , i now have a gun in my home			1
listening to president @entity14 's news conference on thursday marking 100 days after @entity15 , and the whole gun control debate , prompted me to get my viewpoint across			1
he of course was a firm believer in his right to bear arms			1
this posed no issue until our son was born			0
i was adamant that no gun be allowed in our home , while he felt quite the opposite			1
we agreed on one gun locked in a safe , and his other hunting guns were stored at his parents			1
' slowly over the years , i became more and more fearful of being home alone on the nights he worked , especially after i had children			0
we were living in @entity39 on a farm in the middle of nowhere			0
one night , i got a call from my husband telling me to lock all doors and windows as he had just spoken with a sheriff down the road who was looking for an escaped convict			1
we had that one gun , but i had no idea how to use it			1
that changed very quickly over the following weeks , as we went out for target practice			1
i learned how to shoot and for the first time in years , i slept well			0
i finally felt safe at night			0
over the 11 years of our marriage , i slowly learned about guns			1
i began to accept that the gun itself posed no danger -- any danger was in the hand and heart of the beholder			2
i learned there were safe ways to teach your children about guns			2
guns were a tool like any tool ; they have multiple purposes and uses			2
i learned more about our @entity73 and our rights as @entity77 citizens			0
i learned i had nothing to fear and a lot to gain from owning a gun			2
why would someone own a military - style rifle ? i think mothers need to educate themselves and learn how to best educate their kids			0
i work with a lot of other mothers , and many of them are shocked that i was taught how to shoot			0
i understand because i was there at one point -- i was scared of guns			2
but i no longer fear them			0
marine to senator : i wo n't ' register my weapons ' so mr. @entity14 and your gun control advocates : i am not physically capable of stopping a 200 - pound man from raping me or my daughters			2
i am not physically capable of stopping a 200 - pound man from entering my home and doing what he may			0
however , my gun is very capable of stopping such a criminal if such an act were to occur			2
parents defend right to keep guns in the home we live in a society where no one is there to protect us			2
the police come after the crime , not before			0
i do not have 24/7 armed protection like you do , mr. president			0
so until you can explain to this nation why your old city of @entity124 has rising murder rates by guns , despite some of the strictest gun control laws in the country , i will continue to support the @entity130 , i will continue to urge others to support the @entity132 and i will continue to vote for those politicians that support my views			1
i will also support the notion of placing armed police , veterans , etc. in our schools			0
why should your children , mr. president , be of the select few children in this country who are protected by armed guards ? why are your children more special than mine ? guns on campus : @entity130 to announce school safety measures the fact is they are not			0
all children are special and have the right to be cared for and protected			0
i am a mom , and i am proud to support the @entity130 and my right to bear arms			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			1

@entity157 used to be adamant about not having guns in the house
her husband , a @entity162 , firmly believes in the right to bear arms
after a decade , she 's changed her view and supports gun ownership
