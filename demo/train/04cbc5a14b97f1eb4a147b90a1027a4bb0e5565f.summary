happy birthday , @entity1 ! the " @entity3 " turns 80 tuesday , and guess what ? feminism seems to be turning the corner -- again			1
many young women are now embracing the term and rejecting the notion that feminists are hairy , ugly , man - hating , angry women			1
@entity12 , even @entity11 appeared on the cover of @entity1 's magazine , ms. , last year			1
and lest critics point to @entity11 's overt sexuality as evidence of her hypocrisy , this year queen @entity11 took it a step further and wrote an essay for " the @entity24 : a woman 's nation pushes back from the @entity27			2
" in it , @entity11 ( note the hyphenated name ! ) proclaimed that " gender equality is a myth ! " she went on to write , " the average working woman earns only 77 percent of what the average working man makes			1
but unless women and men both say this is unacceptable , things will not change			1
" a few years ago , @entity41 told @entity43 magazine of her " @entity45 " character , " @entity46 's not scared to be clever			2
i think sometimes really smart girls dumb themselves down a bit , and that 's bad			2
" @entity41 added she 's a lot like @entity46 : " i 'm a bit of a feminist			0
i 'm very competitive and challenging			0
" that 's not to say all young women feel the same			1
5 reasons why we love @entity1 @entity58 perverts the word " feminist " all the time			1
he likes to call his targets " feminist extremists " and " feminazis			0
" in 2012 , @entity58 took on @entity65 law student @entity64			1
she testified before @entity66 about the need for her @entity69 university to provide contraception insurance coverage for female students			0
she even admitted to being an " @entity73 woman who uses contraceptives			0
" oh , my ! @entity58 promptly labeled her a " feminazi " and a " slut			1
" or to quote the big man himself , " so , ms. @entity64 and the rest of you feminazis , here 's the deal			1
if we are going to pay for your contraceptives , and thus pay for you to have sex , we want something for it , and i 'll tell you what it is			0
we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch			0
" it so evokes @entity92 , right ? a pro tennis player who , on september 20 , 1973 , challenged @entity94 to a tennis match because " the best way to handle women is to keep them barefoot and pregnant			1
" happy 80th , @entity1 @entity98 , who co-edited @entity99 -- a widely read and influential feminist blog -- and author of " @entity102 , @entity103 , " says many young women have been afraid of the word " feminist " because it 's been the target of a powerful smear campaign for decades			1
but , thanks largely to the @entity111 , smears like @entity58 's are losing their power			1
at @entity99 , she says , " we get mail from teenaged girls in the middle of @entity117 who say ... ' i stumbled on your site and realized feminism is n't about man - hating and @entity123			1
' " it 's actually " kind of cool and counter-cultural			0
really ? @entity98 says yes			0
because today 's feminist movement realized it had to embrace aesthetics			0
beauty and fun and relationships matter , too			0
so does the cool factor			0
@entity132 , anyone ? @entity132 has a cultural agenda , he 's cool , and young people follow him in droves			1
@entity136 , an author sometimes described as a feminist evangelist , says that when she delivered talks on feminism on college campuses a few years ago , one or two hands went up when she asked who considered themselves a feminist			1
today , she says , " now almost all of them do			0
" and , says @entity98 , it 's not just because of " cool " or contraception or abortion rights			0
it 's because of a more evolved definition of feminism			1
" feminism means a fight for others , " @entity98 said			2
it 's about living a " feminist life			0
" that means equality for everyone : women , children and , yes , men			2
that includes advocating on issues like immigration , human trafficking and so much more			0
perhaps @entity168 , an activist and media commentator for @entity170 , @entity171 and her own blog , put it best			0
" in my lifetime feminism has evolved far beyond the binary identity politics of women vs. men , " she wrote in an e-mail			1
" to me , feminism is one part of a larger global movement for liberation			2
gender norms dictating how you ought to behave , dress , marry , or work are oppressive regardless of what body you inhabit or how you identify yourself			2
" she says social media have helped many young activists in her generation speak with powerful voices			2
they no longer need one " figurehead " in " order to create change			0
" they just need each other			0
so , happy birthday , @entity1			1
on your 80th birthday , feminism has indeed turned a corner			2
we 'll have to see how far it has gone when you turn 90			0

the face of feminism , @entity1 , turns 80 on tuesday
