a provocative bake sale designed to satirize affirmative action resulted in no fisticuffs tuesday , but it did prompt a sellout of 300 cupcakes and some heated debate at the @entity7 , the bake sale organizer said			1
" the biggest thing is that no violence broke out			0
there was no physical situation , which is really great , " @entity11 president @entity10 said tuesday afternoon , as the bake sale was nearing an end			1
" we sold out of cupcakes , and i think we have some ( of the 200 ) cookies left , " @entity10 told @entity16			0
" beside from selling cupcakes , there was a lot of conversations between people , " @entity10 said			0
" there were some aggressive people who came up with angry things to say , but there was no violence			0
" in light of recent threats made against supporters of the group , college republicans from several other @entity35 universities showed up by the carloads and volunteered to help staff the event , held on a campus plaza , @entity10 said			2
the flagship campus of the @entity7 system was the state epicenter tuesday in the debate over affirmative action and college admissions			1
on one side , the @entity46 hosted their " @entity48 " -- a satirical event that charged customers different prices based on race and gender			1
yards away , @entity7 's student government -- the @entity54 -- hosted a phone bank in support of @entity58 , state legislation that would allow @entity35 universities to consider race , gender , ethnicity and national origin during the admissions process			1
during the sale , scheduled from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. , baked goods were sold to white men for $ 2 , @entity70 men for $ 1.50 , @entity71 men for $ 1 , black men for 75 cents and @entity68 men for 25 cents			2
all women received 25 cents off those prices			0
" we agree that the event is inherently racist , but that is the point , " @entity10 wrote in response to upheaval over the bake sale			1
" it is no more racist than giving an individual an advantage in college admissions based solely on their race ( or ) gender			1
" @entity54 president @entity88 said many students who attended a community meeting monday night expressed disgust that the bake sale would take place			1
" as a woman of color , when i first saw the event , i was appalled someone would post something like this on the @entity100 -- not only a different pay structure , but also to rank the races , " she said			2
" it trivializes the struggles that people have been through and their histories			0
" @entity10 said he agreed a ranking system for races is n't fair -- not for bake sales , and not in other aspects of life			2
" the purpose of the pricing structure ... is to cause people to disagree with this kind of preferential treatment , " @entity10 said			0
" we want people to say no race is above another race , or no race is below another one			2
why put one over the other ? why rank them that way ? " before the sale , @entity10 said his group would n't enforce the price list			2
" if a white guy comes up and says , ' i want the price from an @entity130 female , ' we absolutely give him that price , " he said			0
there can be complications with self - identifying a race -- especially if a person is multiracial , @entity10 said			2
events similar to the @entity7 bake sale have taken place at other colleges across the country , generally organized by college @entity142 groups			1
in some cases -- such as at @entity7 -- the plan sparked controversy and protests			2
other times , university officials stepped in			0
at @entity151 in @entity152 , officials shut down a similar bake sale on campus			1
officials at @entity156 in @entity157 cut off a cookie sale , saying they were " shocked and appalled			0
" the @entity159 , shut down a bake sale on campus , saying it was discriminatory			1
and a bake sale at @entity164 in @entity165 was shut down after 45 minutes because of what officials called an " unsafe environment , " according to local reports			1
@entity88 , @entity7 's student government president , said she is concerned about students potentially feeling ostracized due to the bake sale			1
" i have heard that from numerous students who have said this makes students feel unwelcome on campus , " she said			0
" for that reason alone , we should think about what events we have on campus			0
" @entity10 said the bake sale at @entity7 was unanimously agreed upon by the club , whose leadership includes @entity70 and @entity184 students and whose membership represents a " wide variety of ethnic backgrounds			1
" " more than half of the voices were female , " he added			0
@entity7 's student government held an emergency senate meeting sunday to discuss the issue and passed a resolution that , in part , " condemns the use of discrimination whether it is in satire or in seriousness by any student group			1
" " i completely support the idea of @entity46 -- or any students on campus -- ( having ) political discussion , " @entity88 said			0
" i think student members of @entity46 have a full right to express their feelings , but i do n't necessarily think this tactic is constructive			0
" as for where the bake sale proceeds will go , @entity10 said the @entity46 are considering several charities			1
but " because of all this controversy , we do n't want to advertise the organization , " he said			0
" we do n't want to cause them problems			0

no problems occur at satirical bake sale -- just *hot* debate , organizer says
bake sale lampooned a bill that would allow race and gender to be considered in admissions
group leader : " we agree that the event is inherently racist , but that is the point "
@entity7 's student government countered with a call - in supporting the bill , @entity235 *185*
