@entity0 -- civil rights lawyers demanded the death penalty for former @entity5 president @entity4 on monday , joining prosecutor 's calls for him to be executed			1
" we merged our voice with the prosecutor 's closing arguments from last week 's hearing and demanded the death sentence to @entity4 , his former interior minister @entity4 , and four of his aides for killing hundreds of protesters and injuring thousands more , " attorney @entity8 told @entity1			1
" we have proof @entity4 is directly responsible for the killings along with @entity4 and his aides			1
" @entity8 said @entity4 deserved to die for violating @entity5 's criminal law 77			1
" his negligence and actions led to endangering the national security of the country , " he said			1
the attorney also provided the court with a list of alleged suspects he wants indicted , including police officers he said where caught on camera firing their weapons on protesters			2
another lawyer , @entity35 , said he provided evidence to the court " of communication between security forces that prove the presence of snipers on rooftop buildings during the revolution			1
" the judge , @entity44 , has set aside monday and tuesday to hear from at least 10 civil rights lawyers			0
the defense is expected to make its closing arguments later in the week			0
" the judge will then decide on a day to announce the final verdict , " said @entity48 , the official spokesman of the general prosecutor 's office			0
" if he is fast , we may see a verdict before january 25th " -- the day the @entity5 uprising began last year			2

@entity63 and @entity64 also issued statements of " concern			0
" @entity4 is accused of corruption and ordering protesters killed during the country 's uprising last year			2
he has denied the charges			0
two of @entity4 's sons are also on trial on a variety of charges			2
the sons , @entity78 and @entity79 , have pleaded not guilty			0
lawyers familiar with the case said it is unlikely @entity4 and his fellow defendants will receive the death penalty			2
this is in part because of the difficulty in proving the president ordered the killings , the lawyers said			0
analysts agreed that while some @entity5 might welcome a death sentence for @entity4 , particularly at a time of heightened tension as the anniversary of the uprising approaches , he is more likely to receive a prison term			1

five police officers accused of killing protesters already have been acquitted			0
@entity102 had estimated more than 840 protesters were killed and 6,000 injured			0
@entity48 , the prosecutor 's spokesman , said the prosecutor 's estimate of 225 deaths and more than 1,300 injured is lower " because there has been a differentiation between those killed outside police stations while attacking the precinct and those shot while protesting			0
