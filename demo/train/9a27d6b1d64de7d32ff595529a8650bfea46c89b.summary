-- multinationals see @entity2 as the " gateway " to @entity4 , says the boss of the country 's largest food company			2
@entity8 , chief executive officer of @entity9 , told @entity0 that the @entity2 economy is " very progressive			1
" he added : " i think it [ @entity2 ] recognizes that it can not rely totally on its own market and it has to look internationally to develop an economy			0
we have been very successful at attracting multinationals into @entity2			0
" this attraction is mainly the result of @entity2 's low corporation tax , which currently stands at 12.5 % and has led to a number of companies becoming headquartered in @entity2			1
the tax rate is far less than @entity22 's , at 33 % , and the @entity23 's , at 24 %			0
this is an issue that has riled @entity2 's @entity4 partners , given the country 's request for sovereign aid from the eurozone 's rescue funds in 2010			1
prior to the financial crisis of 2008 , @entity2 was described as the " @entity33 " of @entity4 , due to its rapidly expanding economy and booming property sector			2
but following a collapse in its banking sector , the country fell on hard times			0
@entity8 is confident the @entity2 economy will come back " much wiser " and " pragmatic " than before , with a focus on prudence			1
he told @entity0 : " i hope the @entity33 does not come back in terms of legacies that still exist			0
" on @entity4 , @entity8 told @entity0 that @entity9 is not " turning its back " on the continent and insists that @entity46 membership has been very positive for the food company and @entity2			1
he added : " prior to @entity2 joining the @entity46 we did n't have exposure to the international markets that we enjoy today , we were somewhat insular in our thinking and it has certainly provided us with the opportunity to take a much more global perspective			2
" @entity0 's @entity57 contributed to this report .			0
