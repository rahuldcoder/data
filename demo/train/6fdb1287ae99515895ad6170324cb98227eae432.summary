seven decades after being sent to @entity1 concentration camps , survivors of the @entity3 will have the chance to get retribution -- from the government of @entity7			1
@entity7 signed an agreement monday with @entity10 authorities to pay $ 60 million to @entity3 survivors transported to concentration camps , said @entity13 , a spokesman for the @entity7 embassy in @entity15			1
@entity16 , @entity7 's ambassador at large for human rights in charge of @entity3 issues , said monday the agreement " is a further contribution to recognizing @entity7 's commitment to facing up to its historic responsibilities			1
" the reparation programs set up immediately after the war , and those introduced in the past fifteen years , are the tangible symbol of the official acknowledgment in 1995 of @entity7 's ' imprescriptible debt ' towards the victims of the @entity3 , " @entity16 said			1
a joint statement from @entity7 's @entity32 and the @entity33 noted that the accord shows the close relationship between the two countries			0
" in this year marked by the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the @entity41 landings in @entity42 and @entity43 , this agreement further strengthens the historic friendship and ties between our two countries , " the statement said			0
@entity10 officials created the fund and will administer it			0
but @entity10 are n't the only ones eligible for compensation ; victims living in nations that have n't signed @entity3 compensation agreements also can benefit , according to the embassy spokesman			2
a few thousand people may be eligible for some of the fund , according to @entity13			0
this fund had been years in the making , and had come under intense pressure inside the @entity10 , including efforts by @entity10 lawmakers to bar the @entity63 , the @entity7 national railway , from bidding in @entity10 markets until the issue is resolved			0
one piece of proposed legislation , the @entity69 , stated that more than 75,000 jews and thousands of others were moved from @entity7 to @entity1 concentration camps on @entity63 trains			2
those transported included @entity10 citizens and their relatives , as well as @entity10 military pilots shot down during the war			0
an official at @entity7 's national railway declined to comment on the agreement when reached by @entity82			1
yet @entity83 explained that the @entity63 was not considered liable for the deportation of @entity70 in @entity7 , because it was commissioned by @entity7 's @entity86 government -- which was formed after the armistice and collaborated with the @entity89 -- to do so			2
this is n't the first time that @entity7 , which was invaded by @entity1 in 1940 before reaching an armistice agreement with @entity94 's government later that year , has borne some responsibility for the @entity3			2
as @entity13 noted , this latest agreement is one of several mechanisms by the @entity7 government to compensate @entity3 victims since 1946 , the year after @entity96 ended			0
the @entity89 systematically killed more than 6 million @entity70 during the holocaust , along with millions of other people who were religious and ethnic minorities , political dissidents , homosexuals or disabled , in death camps situated primarily in @entity1 and @entity107 .			1
