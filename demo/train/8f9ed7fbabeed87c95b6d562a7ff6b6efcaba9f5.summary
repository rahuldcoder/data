-- @entity1 loves a cash cow , and @entity4 's pregnancy bible surely qualifies			1
it spent more than a decade on the @entity6 ' best - seller lists , and there are some 17 million copies in print			0
so what if there 's no story ? there 's a name -- and as all parents know , that 's a major achievement in itself			1
so , what to expect from " @entity18 " -- the movie ? like other recent " concept " films , those cynical date movies -- " @entity23 " and " @entity24 " for instance -- the film wears a celebrity - studded thong to cover any perceived shortcomings in the script department			1
they come in all shapes and sizes , new and old			0
kids your kids will know like @entity36 , and @entity37 , tv personalities like " @entity41 's " @entity39 and @entity40 ( playing herself ) rubbing shoulders with inescapable media magnets like @entity44 and @entity45			1
we even get celebrities playing celebrities : @entity49 as motivational weight - loss guru / dance show winner @entity50 , @entity52 as baby store owner / nursery book author @entity53 , @entity54 as @entity53 's overbearing father - in - law , an @entity57 champ , @entity56			2
these are n't people you meet in my neighborhood , but types we know well from talk shows and supermarket tabloids , and see , here 's the point , when it comes to obstetrics , they 're just like you and me : anxious , nauseous , excited , and at the mercy of the fates			1
screenwriters @entity73 and @entity74 hop between half a dozen couples , most of them residents of @entity77 , and each allocated a representative pregnancy issue			2
@entity79 and @entity80 ( @entity81 and @entity82 ) are adopting a @entity84 baby , but he 's getting cold feet and she 's losing her best - paid gig			2
rival food cart chefs @entity89 and @entity90 ( @entity88 and @entity37 ) get pregnant on their first date , and do n't know if they 're ready to remake " @entity93 " so soon			2
meanwhile @entity53 wants everything to be just perfect but is n't prepared for the gas			0
... the jokes are feeble and the conflicts never transcend sitcom material -- in other words , " @entity18 " is entirely predictable and not a little redundant			1
the days when the movies would discreetly close the door when a woman went into labor ( " hot water , and lots of it ! " ) are long gone			0
it 's been nearly 30 years since @entity4 's book was first published , and there 's hardly an aspect of pregnancy that has n't been channeled into @entity112 ©			1
which is n't to deny there 's something reassuring about seeing other people going through this stuff one more time			0
perhaps the saddest aspect of what is largely , admittedly , an inoffensive and anodyne enterprise , is the sad spectacle of @entity122 and chums wheeling strollers through the park in the service of lame gags about baby - whipped dads			0
as far as we 've come , it would seem that half the world 's parents are still little more than a laughingstock			0
final word : not worth the sitter .			0

the movie is based on @entity4 's pregnancy bible
the jokes are feeble and the conflicts never transcend sitcom material , @entity140 says
" what to expect when you 're expecting " is entirely predictable , the *reviewer* says
