-- the nightmare began around 12:30 p.m. on christmas eve			0
@entity2 stood next to his wife 's hospital bed , stricken			1
the skin was cold , ashen			0
@entity8 's heart had stopped			1
" i opened my hand and her arm just fell out of mine , " said @entity2			2
" she was already gone			0
" moments later , the staff at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , sounded a @entity16 -- resuscitation needed for cardiac arrest			1
they would have to act fast : @entity8 , 33 , was also in labor			1
her baby was perilously close to death			2
but this was a perplexing case			0
before her heart stopped beating , @entity8 was , by all accounts , completely healthy			1
doctors still have few clues about what caused her cardiac arrest			1
" the risk of a woman dying in the course of trying to carry a pregnancy is an incredibly rare event , " said dr. @entity30 , director of obstetrics at @entity32 , who was not involved with @entity2 's case			1
" the number of things that can cause this in an otherwise healthy woman is a very short list			2
" @entity30 says that only around eight in 100,000 women die during childbirth in the @entity48			0
dr. @entity49 was 100 yards away when the @entity16 sounded			0
she ran to the delivery room where @entity2 stood next to what he thought was his dead wife			2
" my first thought was that i ca n't allow this father to lose both his wife and his child , especially on @entity59 , " said @entity53 , director of maternal - fetal medicine at @entity13			1
watch the @entity60 on @entity61 it was a situation she had witnessed only nine or 10 times during her career			0
based on experience , @entity53 had ideas about what might have caused @entity2 's cardiac arrest , but nothing was certain			1
she could rule out things like pre-existing heart problems -- they are rare for someone healthy , young , and with no family history			2
@entity2 had not experienced excessive blood loss or other major trauma , also common reasons for cardiac problems during childbirth			1
watch dr. @entity81 explain what may have happenend @entity2 could have an amniotic fluid embolism , a condition in which the fluid suspending the baby in utero leaks into the mother 's bloodstream			1
it could also be pulmonary embolism , in which a blood clot in the leg breaks off and lodges in lung tissue			0
both conditions cause blood pressure , heart rate and oxygen levels in the blood to plummet -- precisely what was happening to @entity8			1
at 12:40 p.m. , staff attempted to resuscitate @entity2 using a rapid - fire sequence of chest compressions			1
four minutes later , fearing for the baby 's life , they performed an emergency caesarean section			1
" we call it a four - minute rule , " said @entity53			0
" i knew that if @entity8 was not resuscitated by four to five minutes after her heart stopped , [ the baby 's ] chances for brain injury began to increase dramatically			1
" but @entity53 says that if a baby is removed from its mother within five minutes of a witnessed cardiac arrest , the baby will survive 95 percent of the time			1
at 12:46 p.m. , @entity2 and @entity8 's baby boy , @entity124 , was born via c - section , limp , but with a faint pulse			1
moments after her son was born , @entity8 took a timid sip of breath for the first time in several minutes			1
her pulse was barely perceptible , but it was there			0
almost as suddenly as she had " died , " she was alive again			0
" we all stopped and took a breath , " said @entity53			0
" we had to make sure she was n't going to re-arrest			0
doctors quickly wheeled her out to an operating room to finish her @entity139 and put her on a ventilator to help her breathe			0
hospital staff continued their resuscitation of baby @entity143			0
in a few minutes his skin was flushed ; he gasped for air and let out a loud wail			0
" i thought he was dead until he gasped for air , " said @entity2			2
" when he let that cry out , that 's when the whole world stops			2
most parents ca n't stand the sound of a crying baby , but i 'll tell you from experience that 's one of the best sounds you could ever hear			2
" no sooner had @entity2 absorbed that his son was alive than doctors delivered the news that @entity8 was breathing on her own			1
in a span of minutes , @entity2 went from the despair of losing two people to the elation of having them back			2
he says he remains stunned , but grateful			0
" it has changed my life , " he said			0
" you do n't take anything for granted			0
" @entity8 still feels a tingle of fear when she thinks about what happened to her			2
" it 's scary to know you went into the hospital perfectly healthy and then almost not come out of the hospital at all , " she said			2
but almost two weeks removed from near - death , there is little time to think about that			0
the @entity60 want to relish life , with the rest of their family -- sons @entity186 , 11 , and @entity188 , 3			0
@entity8 will undergo more tests in the coming weeks , but doctors still have no idea what happened to her heart on @entity59 .			1

mother @entity8 's heart suddenly stops as she is in labor on @entity59
doctors *battle* to revive her , do c - section to deliver baby @entity124 , limp with faint pulse
both are revived ; @entity8 's *husband* @entity2 goes from grief to *joy* in minutes
tests being done to determine why healthy mom suffered cardiac arrest
