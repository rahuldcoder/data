-- we do n't know where to look first			2
the massive pillars , looking like tree trunks , stone chameleons , tortoises and turtles , help support the columns			2
the sheer size of the place is amazing			2
some of the towers soar more than 500 feet			2
even jaded teens , like my 13 - year - old niece , @entity13 , ca n't help but be impressed			1
@entity16 's @entity15 is @entity17 's most famous site and @entity18 's most visited			1
welcome to @entity16 's unfinished masterpiece , the @entity15 , @entity17 's most famous site and @entity18 's most visited			1
more than 40 years after the eccentric and revered architect 's death -- he was struck by a tram -- work still continues on the huge church first begun in 1882			1
some 2.5 million people visited last year			1
this is a great place to engage the kids in a scavenger hunt			1
( find the fruit carved on top of the towers , the young stone musicians , the birds			2
) there are two completed facades -- one represents the birth of @entity38 , the other the @entity37			2
( if you look closely , you 'll see @entity16 's face			1
) it 's amazing that the project continued after anarchists burned @entity16 's studio , along with the plans for the church , during the @entity48			1
luckily , @entity16 had made plaster models of the church ( we see them in the museum at the site ) and though they were also smashed , his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue			1
@entity16 , so obsessed at the end of his life with completing the church , slept on a bed in his workshop			1
he is buried in the church 's crypt			1
i want to go to the top ( you take an elevator , but walk down the stairs ) , but i think @entity13 has had enough			2
sometimes , you have to know when to call it quits , even at incredible sites like this one			2
i tell myself @entity13 will come back some day and remember how she could n't decide whether she was bored or fascinated			2
@entity70 garden complex , designed to be a housing development , was @entity16 's largest work in @entity17			1
it 's a garden city with fantastically shaped roofs , a house that looks as if it 's made out of candy , and the famous serpentine bench made out of broken mosaic			1
unfortunately , no one in @entity17 gravitated toward the idea			2
the only three houses built were for @entity16 , the developer and the developer 's lawyer			1
i 'd live there in a minute for the spectacular views of @entity17			0
we all love the giant mosaic dragon			0
" cool , " @entity13 says			0
sometimes when trying to show kids new cities , you ca n't hope for more than that			1
@entity17 , home to the @entity93 , is a city that appeals to kids ( especially teens ) and parents			1
in recent years , it 's become a favorite of @entity100 families who board cruise ships here in summer -- as we did last year			1
if you plan to do a lot of touring , get the @entity17 card , which includes free public transportation , museum admissions , restaurant discounts and more			0
there are some 10,000 restaurants in @entity17 and 35,000 shops			0
( did you know more than 20 percent of all spending in @entity18 takes place here ? and with such friendly locals , there 's no better place for the kids to practice their @entity18			1
( starting this spring , @entity117 will fly nonstop from @entity118 to @entity17			0
walk off your jet lag by taking in all the chic couples walking along the beach , the city 's famous art nouveau architecture , the art , ( @entity122 lived here as a teen ) , the ancient @entity127 and the street entertainers along the mile - long @entity129			1
ever see a human flower statue ? a bird market ? i never saw so many different kinds of gummies than at the famous @entity136 food market , said to be the largest in @entity137			0
it 's been here for centuries			1
the kids will give a thumbs up to @entity143 , one of @entity17 's largest recreation areas , which rises nearly 700 feet above the south side of the city			1
we 're holing up overnight at the @entity149 , a @entity150 , a famous icon of the @entity17 skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites			0
there 's nothing like a luxury hotel when you are jet lagged			1
the place is packed with families , even on the concierge level where parents and kids indulge in free breakfasts , snacks and drinks			1
another highlight is the secluded pool area next to the distinctive shadow of the @entity174 fish sculpture			0
but before we hit the pool -- or fall asleep -- a little culture is in order			0
it 's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist 's early years , his @entity187 and early works from @entity17			1
@entity122 moved here in 1895 at the age of 14 and donated some 2,500 art pieces to the museums in 1970			0
( show your young artists what he did as a kid ! ) that night , after we hit the pool , we head to @entity199 , which the hotel concierge told us is a " hip " gathering spot for locals			0
i did n't really see evidence of that , but , after all , we were there at 8:30 , early by @entity17 standards			1
even @entity13 agreed the food was great , especially the wood - fired pizza			0
donkey or bull , our amiable guide @entity212 asks the next morning			0
the bull , of course , is the national symbol of @entity18			0
the donkey is the symbol of the @entity220			0
we learn that people in @entity17 speak @entity222 as well as @entity18 and there 's a fierce matter of national pride			1
from its earliest days , @entity17 has been linked to @entity226 , thus the emphasis here on @entity222 -- @entity229 lies midway between @entity226 and @entity18			0
i 'm determined to have @entity231 for lunch			0
we are in @entity17 after all			0
paella , of course , is the famous @entity18 rice dish that 's usually topped with chicken , sausage and shellfish			2
we head to a small restaurant in the old historic quarter of the city , @entity242			0
i 'm completely charmed by the mosaics and the open kitchen , the way the rooms of the restaurant wind up around an old staircase			0
" i just wo n't eat , " says @entity13 , after perusing the menu			0
there 's no pasta and she does n't want anything else			2
we dig into our paella			0
@entity13 agrees to taste it , as long as i take the shells off the shrimp			0
not bad , she says , helping herself to more rice			0
i just sip my sangria and do n't say a word			0
a few months later , @entity13 tells me she 's already decided where she wants to go abroad when she 's in college -- @entity17			2
