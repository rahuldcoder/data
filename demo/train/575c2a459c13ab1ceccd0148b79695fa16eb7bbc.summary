he was a basketball - loving kid from the @entity2 who turned into a jihadi - fighting terrorist in @entity4 -- and then died there			1
exactly what spurred @entity7 's metamorphosis remains murky			1
but while his radicalization and death have stunned loved ones back home , his actions abroad have raised fears that other @entity14 may follow suit			1
here 's what we know about the 33 - year - old man who died while fighting for @entity19 , the radical militant group that has captured swaths of @entity21 and @entity4 and spawned major concerns in the @entity14 : @entity14 on alert amid new claim of @entity14 killed in @entity4 he grew up in @entity26 @entity7 grew up in the @entity29 suburb of @entity30 , his friend @entity27 said			1
the two lived in the same @entity30 apartment building and became fast friends			0
" when i first moved here , i did n't know anyone , so i went to the park and i would see him and his brother and a bunch of other people playing basketball , and he asked me if i wanted to play , " @entity27 said			0
" we just hung out pretty much from 10 o'clock in the morning all the way until nighttime			0
we 'd just play basketball and talk			0
... he was an older guy that i looked up to			0
he was actually a good dude			0
" @entity27 remembers @entity7 as a nice , quiet young man , but one who was looking for purpose in life			2
when @entity50 joined the @entity51 in 2007 and served in @entity21 , @entity7 was impressed that his friend was making something of his life and wanted to do the same , @entity27 said			2
but after learning that @entity7 died while fighting for @entity19 , which is trying to establish an @entity56 state across @entity21 and @entity4 , his friend was bewildered			1
" it just hurts a little bit knowing that if he was over there and i was over there at the same time , we would 've been going against each other , " @entity27 said			0
" that 's what hurts the most because he was a good person , and i just do n't understand why anyone would do anything to the @entity14 " his family is stunned and he was raised by good parents , @entity27 added			1
he said @entity7 's mother attended church regularly , while the father is deceased			1
@entity74 described the nephew he knew as " a good person , loved his family , loved his mother , loved his faith " -- the latter being a reference to @entity79 he practiced before his conversion to @entity56 several years ago			0
opinion : when @entity14 leave for jihad the family was n't alarmed by his conversion			1
but @entity7 's @entity89 posts sympathetic to @entity19 got relatives ' attention , the uncle said			1
" we are devastated , and we are just as surprised as the country is , " @entity74 said of the news his nephew had become a jihadi in @entity4			2
but not every family member believes @entity98 joined @entity19 , a group with tactics so brutal even @entity100 has disowned it			1
" we 're from @entity101			0
we grew up in @entity26 , " his cousin @entity102 told @entity105 affiliate @entity104			2
" he 's not a terrorist			0
" " his religion was very important to him , but those people -- the @entity19 people -- they do n't represent what my cousin 's beliefs are or were at all			1
" @entity102 -- who said @entity7 commented about her sons growing up on a @entity89 photo a few days before his death -- wondered if her cousin may have gotten caught up in the wrong crowd			1
" why was he in @entity4 ? ... what kind of people was he hanging around ? i feel like maybe it was the people he was hanging out with because that 's not who he is			1
he 's not @entity19 , " she said			1
spent time in @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 @entity98 did n't take a straight path from @entity26 to @entity4 , from @entity79 to an extreme brand of @entity56 , from " good person " to accused terrorist			1
physically , he moved around some as well			0
that includes time in @entity131 , where he attended @entity140 , according to spokesman @entity141			0
at the beginning of this decade , @entity7 also spent time in @entity132			2
an acquaintance of his in that @entity145 nation , @entity143 , remembers him as " a really good basketball player " and a " fun guy who spread a lot of good energy			0
" " i never noticed him giving any bad energy , at all , to anybody , " @entity143 said from @entity150 , @entity132			0
" everybody who met him , of those i know , remember him the same way			0
" @entity7 appeared to have no problem with anyone 's religion -- including that of @entity143 , who is @entity160			2
while all his stops are n't publicly known , uncle @entity74 did say that his nephew was in @entity133 when he last touched base with him a few months ago			2
not coincidentally , @entity133 borders @entity4			1
from hip - hop dancer to jihadist : how dad tracked down son in @entity4 @entity14 government had been monitoring him @entity7 had several run - ins with local law enforcement in @entity26 since 2000 , according to the @entity171			1
these include arrests for disorderly conduct , speeding , driving after revocation , theft by swindle and giving an officer false information			0
and in 2003 , he paid a $ 250 fine after pleading guilty to having marijuana in a motor vehicle , according to court records			0
still , these were minor issues , certainly not matters of national security			0
in the early 2000s , though , @entity98 did come to the federal government 's attention , according to a @entity14 official			1
he was associated over the years with numerous people who authorities were watching -- including one from @entity26 who ended up dying in @entity193 while fighting as a jihadi -- the official said			2
but there was no indication that @entity7 was involved in anything nefarious during his time in the @entity2			2
things changed , though , as the years went by			0
@entity14 counterterrorism investigators had been looking into his activities for some time before his death , a @entity14 official said			2
@entity7 was on a list of @entity14 who are believed to have joined militant groups and who would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if he traveled			1
it 's not clear when @entity7 got on that list			2
moreover , @entity14 authorities did not learn that he was in @entity133 until he was already there , according to a @entity14 official			1
how and why he moved on to @entity4 , how and why he became a jihadist and joined @entity19 , befuddles those who knew him back in the @entity14			1
some clues about his final days , weeks and months may lie in a @entity216 account reported to be that of @entity7 's			1
a june 9 message read : " i will be joining you guys soon			0
" he followed up the next day , " i 'm with the brothers now			0
" then came this perhaps telling retweet , on june 26 : " it takes a warrior to understand a warrior			0
" who is the @entity19 ? how @entity19 is overshadowing @entity100			0

retweet from @entity7 's purported account refers to warriors ; says " pray for @entity19 "
@entity231 says @entity7 commented on a photo of her sons just before his death
the @entity26 - bred @entity7 died while fighting for the radical militant group @entity19 in @entity4
the @entity14 government had tracked @entity7 , but did n't know he had traveled to @entity133
