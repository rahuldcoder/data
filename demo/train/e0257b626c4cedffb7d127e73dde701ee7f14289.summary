-- @entity2 and @entity3 leaders weighed the pros and cons of arming @entity7 's rebels wednesday -- a possibility made more urgent by a series of new military setbacks for forces seeking to topple strongman @entity12			1
government forces have been pushing from @entity14 to @entity15 , a critical eastern oil town that the opposition seized on sunday			0
@entity12 's military has also launched escalated strikes in the western town of @entity20			2
the new offensive was launched in the wake of an international arms embargo and air strike campaign designed to establish a no - fly zone and provide humanitarian relief for civilians threatened by the @entity7 military			1
@entity30 prime minister @entity29 told the @entity31 wednesday that the @entity43 @entity42 mandate " allows all necessary measures to protect civilians and populated areas ( and ) this would not necessarily rule out provision of assistance to those protecting civilians in certain circumstances			2
" " as i 've said before , we do not rule it out but we have not taken the decision to do so , " he said			0
@entity3 president @entity47 said tuesday he is also open to the possibility of arming rebel fighters			1
" i 'm not ruling it out , but i 'm also not ruling it in , " he told @entity50			0
in a separate interview with @entity52 , @entity47 said that " if we wanted to get weapons into @entity7 , we probably could			2
... we 're looking at all our options at this point			0
" one significant problem , however , is the need to train opposition forces on how to use advanced weaponry			1
" the notion of the gang that could n't shoot straight might be lived out , " retired maj. gen. @entity60 told @entity0 tuesday night			0
" there must be some degree of training associated with arming this force , " said @entity60 , a former commanding general of the @entity63			2
" however , some weapons systems , clearly they can get a handle on and they can use immediately			0
it 's the more lethal weapon systems that would require training , and i do n't think there 's time to do that			2
" another problem : a possible @entity78 and @entity79 presence within @entity7 's rebel movement			1
@entity3 intelligence has detected evidence of " flickers " of @entity78 and @entity79 elements among the rebels , according to adm. @entity86 , the @entity3 @entity87 commander			1
@entity86 stressed tuesday , however , that such a presence appears to be minimal			0
" the intelligence that i 'm receiving at this point makes me feel that the leadership that i 'm seeing are responsible men and women who are struggling against col. @entity12 , " @entity86 told a congressional committee			0
@entity86 's comments come the same day that @entity3 secretary of state @entity95 met with leaders of @entity7 's opposition in @entity98			1
a senior counterterrorism official , unnamed because he is not authorized to speak on the record , backed up @entity86 ' assessment , downplaying the concern about @entity78 among the @entity7 opposition			1
there is probably " a sprinkling of extremists to perhaps include @entity78 " in @entity7 among the rebels , " but no one should think the opposition is being led by @entity78 or one of its affiliates , " the official said			1
@entity78 has had a presence in @entity113 for years			2
" it 's hard to tell who all the leaders are in the opposition , " the official said , but " the rebels do not appear to be adopting an @entity78 bent or ideology in @entity7			1
" @entity123 press secretary @entity122 told reporters tuesday that the rebel leaders meeting with @entity129 " made clear what their principles are			0
" " we believe that ( their principles are ) meritorious , " @entity122 said			0
@entity0 's @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report			0

@entity30 and @entity3 leaders are openly considering arming the @entity7 rebels
