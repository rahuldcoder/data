@entity1 users will soon be able to conduct voice and video calls supported by a near - real time translation technology			1
and while it ca n't yet guarantee that no fine detail will be lost in translation , @entity6 's new idea for its video chat platform surely feels like something straight out of science fiction			2
no longer will our hopes for such a marvel be tagged to imaginary aquatic creatures -- the @entity16 from " @entity17 " -- or improbable " telepathic fields " , such as the one cast by @entity19 's @entity20 to relay any alien language to its pilot in plain @entity23			2
it all sounds , in fact , quite similar to what @entity28 in @entity29 use to make their generally belligerent intentions quite clear : an unseen , but ever - present , " universal translator "			2
" the idea that people do n't understand each other , it 's going to be a thing of the past , " @entity33 , corporate vp of @entity1 , told @entity35 's @entity34			0
" in the same way it 's hard to imagine a world before you were able to travel to different places and quickly , whether it be in a car or a plane , we 'll never think about , wow , those were the dark ages where people could n't understand each other			0
that 's where we 're headed			0
" called @entity54 , the add - on builds on the research done for @entity56 , and uses a technology called @entity58 , which yields significantly better speech recognition results than previous methods			1
it will be available as a @entity63 beta app before the end of the year , but @entity6 is already showing off its @entity23 to @entity66 functionality , as you can see in the video above			1
it is still unclear whether the service will be free for the 300 million @entity1 users , or will be extended to other platforms			0
@entity6 is not alone in its quest for a universal translator			0
@entity75 already offers translation by voice in its @entity79 service and is also working on integrating real - time translation into @entity81			1
and @entity82 , a @entity84 device that promises real time speech translation in 25 languages , went through a successful crowdfunding campaign last year			1
read more from tomorrow transformed : @entity88 , the app that voiced @entity91 's protests the " green man " in your traffic lights just got new super powers finally , a flying car for everybody ?			0

@entity54 offers near - real time language translation during video calls
a beta version will be *launched* as a @entity63 app later this year
the new technology promises improved speech recognition *compared* to previous methods
