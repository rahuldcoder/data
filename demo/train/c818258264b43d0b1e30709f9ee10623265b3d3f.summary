" you got me , " @entity8 told officers after initially denying his identity , according to @entity10 police			1
he had spent about an hour at the nondescript cafe perusing internet news accounts of his exploits , according to a cafe worker			1
suspect describes himself as ' people person ' " we can confirm this individual has been arrested , " said @entity31 , a @entity5 ministry of public safety spokeswoman			1
" we expect that the individual responsible for these troubling acts will face the full force of the law			0
" authorities in @entity41 -- where police found murder victim @entity44 's torso in a trash bin outside @entity8 's apartment -- were " extremely relieved " about the arrest , police @entity48			1
he said that investigators would begin looking into possible links to other crimes and that authorities have much work ahead of them in bringing @entity8 back to @entity5 to face trial			1
" this is far from being over , " @entity50 said			0
authorities were seeking @entity8 on first - degree murder and other charges in the killing of @entity44 , 33 , a @entity63 student from @entity64 , and threatening , among others , @entity5 's prime minister by mailing him a severed foot			1
not all the body parts have been recovered , and @entity50 said forensic evidence and dna were used to identify the victim as @entity72 the search for @entity8 had captured worldwide attention after news that the efforts to find him had moved to @entity77 following a number of reported sightings there			1
@entity8 was believed to have fled to @entity81 under an assumed name , @entity50 said			1
he said authorities did not yet know when @entity8 had traveled to @entity10 , or how			1
the case began last week when a package addressed to prime minister @entity87 arrived at his majority @entity89 headquarters , and a hand was later found at a post office addressed to the minority @entity93 , authorities said			0
authorities quickly traced the address on the packages to the @entity41 apartment of @entity8 , where they discovered a torso in a suitcase in a trash bin			1
@entity44 's death and dismemberment were allegedly captured on a graphic video posted to the @entity106 , according to @entity41 police			1
it features a man -- who authorities believe is @entity8 -- killing another man , dismembering the corpse and performing sexual acts			1
" we believe he filmed himself , " @entity50 said last week			0
... this is a very deranged person			0
he is looking for attention , and he got it , but not in a positive way			0
" authorities believe @entity8 killed @entity44 on may 24 or may 25 , posted the video , and on may 26 fled the country by plane to @entity126 , most likely @entity81			1
that prompted @entity128 , the global police agency , to alert authorities in 190 countries			2
over the weekend , police said there were indications that the suspect may have been aboard a flight from @entity81 back to @entity41			1
there was no sign of him after a search of the plane , @entity50 said			0
since the case went public , new details have emerged daily , new chapters in a grisly saga with an alleged culprit that police say is infatuated with self - promotion			2
according to @entity5 media reports , @entity8 promoted himself as a gay porn actor through a graphic website that showcases a chameleon - like quality : the ability to change his appearance			1
in one picture , with dark hair , he resembles a teenager			0
in another , with blond hair , he looks rough			0
authorities allege he even changes his names , using the aliases @entity161 or @entity8			2
" there are a lot of pictures of him out there , and it will help lead him to us , " @entity50 told reporters over the weekend			2
his name may not have been known before last week , but @entity8 's digital footprints were large			2
he was notorious among online animal rights activists , who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used cat carcasses in sexual acts			0
a @entity176 group started in december 2010 dubbed him the " @entity182 , " after a video was posted on @entity179 showing kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning			0
several @entity5 newspapers also reported that @entity8 had dated notorious @entity5 killer @entity184 , who years before was arrested for the rapes and murders of three @entity188 girls , including her own sister			1
as part of a plea bargain , @entity184 served 12 years in prison			0
@entity50 said he could not confirm any links and @entity194 is not part of the investigation			0
now , there are reports that @entity8 threatened to kill as early as six months ago during an encounter with a reporter at the @entity201 the @entity203 newspaper implicated @entity8 as a suspect in the videotaped killing of a kitten , which it reports he initially denied			2
then , according to the newspaper , it received an e-mail describing how the writer planned to move on from killing animals to people			0
the writer , the newspaper reported over the weekend , was @entity8			2
" we 're talking about a very strange , unhinged individual , " said the @entity201 's @entity216			0
" obviously , we did give those details to the police in this country			2
" but there was little @entity203 authorities could do , with @entity8 back in @entity5			1
@entity50 has said police are aware of the animal abuse allegations			0
on what appears to be his website , @entity8 defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking			2
" once and for all , i will set the record straight , " he wrote			0
" many hoax websites are created using my image and name , posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website ( sic ) have , i feel i do n't need to list them specifically but people need not be told , not to believe what they read and to take it as fact			0
" the website has writing in @entity244 and @entity245 , and shows images of @entity8 half - naked and with his lips in a distinct runway pout			2
@entity50 from the @entity41 police had expressed confidence that @entity8 would be caught sooner or later -- predicting his desire for attention could be his downfall			1
" this man uses the @entity255 to glorify himself , and ( authorities ) hope this habit will lead to his capture , " the police commander said saturday			0
