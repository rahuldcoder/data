-- there 's a reason most of @entity4 's population clusters near the @entity6 border			1
it 's safer there -- ok , give or take certain @entity10 pubs			1
the country just gets wilder the further north you go			2
from its ghostly peat bog moors , to the minke whales and basking sharks patrolling its islands , the wild geese that flock here and even its own indigenous cat ( a wild cat -- in @entity4 ? ) , this small country contains some of the most unspoiled territory left in @entity24			1
yet few people in heavily urbanized @entity26 -- or outside it -- know much of these fiercely beautiful places within their country 's borders			1
fewer still have explored them			2
below is the nitty - gritty ( there 's probably some @entity4 way of saying that ) of getting to them , starting with a certain improbable cat ... 1			1
" @entity37 tigers " there are fewer than 100 purebred wildcats left in @entity4			1
seeing a " highland tiger " in the wild is a rare privilege , but you might glimpse one in the thick heather and fir woodlands of the @entity45 ( access free , 365 days a year )			1
this pocket wilderness is home to red deer , golden eagle and osprey , as well as wildcats			2
most of the park , whose landscapes include four of @entity4 's five highest peaks , can be explored only on foot			1
the curlew 's cry on the moor few places feel as wild as windswept @entity62			1
only one road crosses this expanse of peat bog , heather moorland , streams and lochans ( a small loch )			2
often the only sound here is the cry of the curlew , a wading bird			2
this remote country is traversed by the @entity75			2
after crossing the moor , this long - distance trail plunges into the forbidding ravine of @entity79			2
in 1692 , @entity81 soldiers in government pay massacred almost 80 @entity83 clanspeople here			2
the walk across the moor from @entity86 ( four trains daily from @entity10 -- see @entity88 ) takes one day			1
allow another day to walk to @entity79 and down the rugged " @entity89 " to the coast			2
you can camp anywhere on the way , but beware of swarms of biting midges in summer			2
@entity4 -- by sea kayak the @entity97 is @entity24 's first long - distance sea kayak journey			1
this 500 - kilometer odyssey takes in almost mythically beautiful stretches of coastline between @entity102 , off the @entity103 , and the @entity104 , near @entity105			2
you can do the journey in stages , or in one epic voyage that takes around two weeks			0
@entity111 ( @entity110 , @entity112 , @entity113 ; +44 ( 0 ) 1479 420 420 ) offers four - and five - day guided journeys from £ 895 ( $ 1,420 )			0
the price includes equipment , hotel accommodation and ground transfers			0
@entity119 's shorter , tougher rival @entity123 , rising above the desolation of @entity122 , is n't among @entity4 's highest mountains			1
reaching its 2,399 - foot summit , though , involves a near - vertical scramble up rocky gullies and is a far greater challenge than the comparative stroll to the peak of much higher @entity119			0
at the top , after the nerve - racking final ridge traverse , a spectacular panorama of loch and moorland scenery rewards you			0
with luck , golden eagles will be soaring overhead			0
@entity123 is 19 kilometers south - east of the village of @entity142 , @entity122 ; access is free			0
downloadable maps are available at @entity145			0
wild geese and clashing stags vast flocks of wildfowl darken @entity151 's skies in winter , when tens of thousands of barnacle geese and white - fronted geese migrate from the @entity154 to this southern @entity156 isle			1
their arrival in autumn and departure in spring are among @entity24 's most memorable wildlife spectacles			1
@entity151 is also the best place in @entity4 to see red deer stags up close as they clash antlers to establish their mating territory			1
at the same time of year , you 'll see mad march hares " dancing " as they , too , seek mates			0
seals and otters haunt the island 's rugged coastline			1
@entity173 ( @entity172 , @entity151 ; 44 1496 850 120 ) offers morning and evening photo safaris from £ 20 ( $ 32 )			0
benign beaver hunt beavers -- extinct in @entity4 for 400 years -- were reintroduced into the wild in 2009			1
a small colony has set up home at @entity180 and @entity181 , in @entity182			0
@entity183 is a unique wetland landscape of rocky ridges and lush oak woodland			0
as well as beavers , it 's home to otters and a rich variety of birdlife			1
guides from @entity193 ( @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 ) lead walks to lochs , beaver dams and feeding sites			1
minke whales and loggerhead turtles the waters around the @entity204 are surging with marine life			0
you can take a boat trip from this lovely west coast island to spot minke whale , dolphin , porpoise and basking sharks at sea , seals and otters on island shores and sea eagles in the sky above			0
rarer sightings may include giant ocean sunfish and even loggerhead turtles			0
a three hour wildlife - watching boat trip with @entity223 ( @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity204 ; +44 ( 0 ) 1680 300 444 ) costs £ 35 ( $ 55 )			0
climbing the twisted @entity226 of @entity227 the " stacks " of @entity4 's west coast offer unique climbing routes			1
these steep rock pinnacles rise straight from the waves and challenge the boldest climber			0
the @entity234 , a twisted , 60 - meter sandstone spire , is rated among the best of these multi-pitch climbs , with a 55 - meter abseil back to sea level from the summit			0
go further @entity4 ( 9 @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 ; + 44 ( 0 ) 1445 771 260 ) offers guided ascents ( maximum two climbers per expert guide ) from £ 130 ( $ 207 ) per climber			1
abandoned @entity248 it 's hard to believe people ever lived on @entity248			1
after centuries of grinding hardship , in 1930 the last islanders asked to be resettled on the mainland			0
since then , @entity248 's only permanent inhabitants have been seabirds , wild sheep and a unique species of fieldmouse			1
this is the wildest of wild places			1
getting here , even in a modern vessel , takes hardihood			0
@entity248 's sheer cliffs provide nesting places for huge flocks of gannets and fulmars			1
below the sea 's surface , the cliffs plunge deep , creating world - class wall dives			1
@entity274 ( @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity204 ; +44 ( 0 ) 1688 302 495 ) operates luxury liveaboard wildlife and diving cruises			0
prices from £ 1,000 ( $ 1,600 ) per person for a six night cruise			0
wild stories and then there are the wild stories -- of which one of @entity4 's wildest concerns the supposed monstrous inhabitant of @entity288			1
on an overcast day , it 's easy enough to believe unknown life forms lurk in its depths			2
and cryptozoology is big business in these parts -- but this vast , dark loch , containing more water than all the lakes in @entity6 and @entity299 combined , is impressive , @entity300 or no. the unsettled side of the loch , which you can paddle to from @entity304 , feels remarkably unspoiled for such a well - known place as @entity288 -- no wonder whisky smugglers used to love its calm , hidden little bays			2
@entity309 ( @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity304 , @entity313 - shire ; + 44 ( 0 ) 1320 366 277 ) offers one - hour " monster - spotting " trips on @entity315 and sonar - equipped boats , from £ 22 ( $ 35 ) per person			0
