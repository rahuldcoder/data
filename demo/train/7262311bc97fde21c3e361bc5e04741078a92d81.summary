-- the @entity2 's support for same - sex marriage is starting to grow			1
in the past 16 months , the number of @entity2 legislators supporting equal access to civil marriage quadrupled -- from just two to eight			1
and recently , @entity8 rep. @entity8 of @entity9 , a swing - district legislator with a deep personal and religious belief in traditional marriage , made a case we will hear more -- a good society should confer the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage on same - sex couples while respecting the religious freedom of houses of worship to perform the sacrament of marriage only in the ways they see fit			1
" as a matter of my @entity28 faith , i believe in traditional marriage			2
but as a matter of constitutional principle i believe in a form of limited government that protects personal liberty			0
to me , that means that the sanctity of one 's marriage should be defined by their faith and by their church , not by their state			1
" accordingly , i believe it is fully appropriate for a state to recognize both traditional marriage as well as same - sex marriage , and therefore i support the recent decision by a @entity49 circuit judge			1
" that july 17 decision applies only to @entity49 , @entity9 , home to @entity51			0
@entity9 's attorney general is appealing the ruling			0
@entity8 's view is consistent with core @entity2 values of limited government , individual liberty , personal responsibility and stronger families			1
more conservatives are starting to understand that the sanctity of a couple 's marriage should be determined by their faith and that the legality of their marriage should be determined by law -- equally applied to all			1
this means that government should respect the right of churches to perform only blessings in which they believe , and it should respect the inherent right of citizens to marry the person they love , without using tax dollars to deny them that basic freedom			0
the foundation of the @entity2 respects personal freedom without unnecessary government intrusion			0
so why should marriage be any different ? the @entity2 's stance is changing beyond the halls of @entity86			1
@entity2 governors with traditional perspectives on marriage are finding principled , inclusive positions			2
@entity92 of @entity93 , @entity94 of @entity95 and @entity96 of @entity97 have not changed their personal views of marriage , but they have responsibly refused to pursue costly and certain - to - lose litigation over the issue , choosing instead to focus on bread - and - butter issues			0
@entity105 gov. @entity104 , who has opposed same - sex marriage , said recently that his own views do n't matter and that courts will resolve the issue			1
@entity111 gov. @entity110 has allowed her state to move on as well , opting not to amend her state constitution in what would be a misguided attempt to prevent same - sex couples from experiencing the joys and challenges of marriage			1
attitudes toward employment discrimination against gays are also changing			1
in addition to @entity92 and @entity104 's public stands against discrimination , @entity2 gov. @entity123 of @entity124 said he was open to talks on the issue and gov. @entity130 of @entity131 has suggested that state law could be updated to ensure @entity134 workers are judged on their qualifications , hard work and merit -- and not on their sexual orientation			1
these principled statements are not simply a defense mechanism to win votes in upcoming elections			0
they reflect a heartfelt acknowledgment that every citizen should be treated fairly and equally under the law and that gay and lesbian @entity134 are just as @entity134 as the rest of us			0
appeals court rejects @entity152 same - sex marriage ban the battle within the @entity2 for gay rights is not yet won			1
there are outliers like @entity158 gov. @entity157 , who has likely done permanent damage to his presidential aspirations by suggesting being gay and or lesbian is like being an alcoholic -- you can choose not to do it			0
these comments are harmful to gay and lesbian people and fly in the face of what straight people innately know about the immutability of sexual orientation			0
even worse , @entity157 's comments repel swing voters from considering worthy @entity2 policy solutions for fear that the @entity2 cares more about pursuing a narrow social agenda that threatens the freedom of their family and friends			2
the tide is turning in favor of freedom across the country			0
and that means a more accepting and inclusive message is emerging			0
the @entity2 is ready for change , and it 's ready to welcome people with sincerely held beliefs on both sides of the marriage issue -- both in terms of party membership and in terms of primary politics			2
across the country , @entity2 candidates are being judged on their substance and ability to advocate for economic freedom , and not because of their positions on marriage			2
an impressive number of @entity2 state legislators , 233 , have stood up for the freedom to marry , and only three have lost their seats because of that stand			2
that reflects a party and a country that 's ready bury the politics of @entity215 freedom in the graveyard of defunct wedge issues			0
the bottom line is that even if your personal religious views do not align with same - sex marriage , someone else 's do			1
we should be able to disagree , treat each other with respect and live our lives with freedom and equal opportunity under the law			0
@entity2 leaders are beginning to " get it " and that 's good for an @entity134 that belongs to all of us .			2

@entity2 's @entity8 says a state can allow gay marriage , but houses of worship should have option
@entity245 : more conservatives think state determines legality , faith determines sanctity
