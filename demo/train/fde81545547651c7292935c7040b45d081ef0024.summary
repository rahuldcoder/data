-- a cadaver dog searching the home where a missing 11 - month - old @entity4 girl was reportedly last seen indicated a positive " hit " for the scent of a body , according to documents released friday			1
the information was included in an affidavit , dated tuesday , police filed to request a search warrant of @entity14 's @entity13 home			1
@entity14 was reported missing at 4 a.m. october 4 , after @entity16 's father , @entity14 , came home from work to find the door unlocked , the lights on and a window that had been tampered with			1
@entity16 's mother , @entity14 , said she last saw @entity16 at 6:40 p.m. the night before			1
" the cadaver dog indicated a positive ' hit ' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of @entity29 's bedroom near the bed , " the affidavit read			2
it also said that interviews with people involved in the case " revealed conflicting information " and that @entity29 told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she " was afraid of what she might find			1
" a judge approved the search warrant , which allowed investigators to comb the house and barred the family from returning home			1
the warrant was executed on wednesday			2
police took clothing , blankets , a toy , rolls of tape and a tape dispenser from the home , documents showed			1
the attorney for @entity16 's parents said the release of the affidavit friday was " unfortunate , " as it could derail the search for the missing girl			1
@entity64 described his clients as " very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive			1
" he said @entity16 's parents are " terrified , not for themselves , but for the welfare of their daughter			1
" the attorney also stressed cadaver dogs are just meant to be an investigative tool , and can not be considered a basis for legal action against his clients			1
the family 's private investigator , @entity79 , called the information contained in the affidavit " interesting			2
" " i 'm eager to get the facts ( and ) i hope it leads to finding baby @entity16 , " he said			2
earlier in the week , @entity29 said in an @entity86 interview that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported			2
@entity29 told @entity86 she is afraid she will be arrested			2
police have accused her of killing @entity16 , she said , and told her that she failed a lie detector test			1
" i was the last one with her , " a tearful @entity29 said			0
" and from judging on how the questioning went , that 's kind of a fear that i have			0
and the main fear with that is , if they arrest me , people are going to stop looking for her			0
and then i 'll never see her again , and i 'll never know what happened			0
" asked how much she had been drinking that night , @entity29 said , " enough to be drunk			0
" but she rejected the notion that she could have harmed her daughter while under the influence of alcohol			0
" no , no , no , " she told @entity86			0
" and if i thought there was a chance , i 'd say it			0
no. no. i do n't think alcohol changes a person enough to do something like that			0
" asked whether he had questions about @entity29 , @entity14 told @entity86 , " no. there 's no question to be had there			1
i know who she is			0
i know the kind of mother she is			0
" @entity123 said it 's possible someone could have entered the house without @entity29 hearing , as the couple 's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from @entity16 's room and @entity29 sleeps with a fan at high speed			0
@entity16 is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blonde hair , according to police			1
she weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it			0
the missing girl has two bottom teeth and a " beauty mark " on her right outer thigh , police said			2
at the time of her disappearance , she had a cold with a cough			0
