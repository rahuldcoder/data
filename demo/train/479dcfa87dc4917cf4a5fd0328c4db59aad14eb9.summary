-- with a name like @entity3 , you ca n't escape the fact that you 're different from your classmates in school			1
from the first grade on , i was constantly looked down upon and treated differently -- and sometimes not so nicely			0
i 'm an @entity9 brat			0
my father was a decorated veteran of the @entity13 65th @entity12 that bravely fought in the @entity14			0
when he left the armed forces , he became a corporate executive for @entity17 in @entity18 , which is where i grew up from the age of 6 until i was 21 years old			2
when i came to the @entity21 to finish my education and became a journalist , i was fascinated by how little people really understood @entity25			1
so i have spent my whole professional life helping my fellow @entity21 understand who we are			1
the last two @entity30 reports and presidential elections have certainly elevated the awareness of the power and growth of the @entity21 @entity36 community , especially in certain sectors , politics being one of them			1
but there is still a lot of ignorance about the important impact hispanics are having on every sector of the @entity21 economy			0
@entity21 @entity36 population is growing fast , and traditional demographic patterns are shifting there are seven sectors of business -- retail , food , entertainment , financial services , etc. -- that offer companies unprecedented domestic growth opportunities , if only they will focus their efforts on marketing to @entity36			1
but business leaders do n't feel like they know how to take the proper steps to capitalize on their @entity36 opportunity , so they do n't do anything at all			2
on average , only 5 % to 6 % of all advertising budgets is allocated to marketing to @entity25 , who already represent 17 % of the total population and 20 % or more of key demographic groups -- children , teens , and millennials			0
clearly , there is a fundamental gap between awareness of the need to start marketing to @entity25 and the ability to do so			0
business leaders often do n't know where to begin			0
it all feels very scary to them -- partly because for so long , language has been the main way people think about @entity36 marketing , when in fact , it 's all about culture and creating marketing campaigns that are culturally relevant			0
fewer latinos will speak @entity88 , more non-latinos will when minorities in general make up almost half of all millennials -- with @entity36 accounting for nearly 25 % of them and growing at the fastest pace -- this is an opportunity you can no longer ignore			2
how can you have a millennial strategy without asking yourself " what about @entity36 ? " you simply ca n't afford to leave out one quarter of your target simply because you do n't know how to talk to them			1
if you do , chances are your competition will figure it out and you will lose in the long term			0
@entity36 are creating a new baby boom in the @entity21			1
think of it this way : every 30 seconds , two non-hispanics reach retirement age and one @entity36 turns 18			1
like the baby boomers before us , the @entity36 baby boom will affect every aspect of @entity21 life over the next 50 years			1
do you want to be the one missing out on this opportunity ? i think not			0
although i have spent the last month giving speeches about the importance of the @entity36 community as part of various events celebrating @entity125 , i feel like the designation of @entity125 is becoming an anachronism			2
in many ways the influence of @entity36 on @entity21 can be felt every day			1
does @entity125 matter ? from the grocery aisle where you pick up your @entity135 beer and your @entity137 ice cream , to the billboard charts where @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 routinely dominate , to the lunch you order at @entity143 or @entity144 or , in fact , at the great @entity21 fast feeder , @entity130 -- the @entity36 effect is everywhere			1
the media and both political parties now readily acknowledge that it was the influence of the @entity36 vote in the key swing states that got president @entity152 re-elected last year			0
in fact , just two weeks ago , @entity153 said that insufficient @entity36 outreach was his largest error in 2012			0
the story behind @entity125 " the largest strategic error was not investing sufficiently , particularly in @entity36 tv and @entity36 outreach to help @entity36 voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity , " @entity153 told @entity0 's @entity158 of the lesson to be learned for @entity161 presidential campaigns of the future			2
funny , because just this past summer , @entity170 made history when it came in first place during the july sweeps , beating @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 in the much coveted demographic of adults 18 - 34			0
i ca n't think of a more appropriate way to recognize the influence @entity36 are having on @entity21			1
25 stories that shaped the @entity36 community the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 spent whole professional life helping fellow @entity21 understand @entity25
every 30 seconds , two non-hispanics reach retirement age and one @entity36 turns 18
" @entity36 baby boom " will affect every aspect of @entity21 life over the next 50 years
@entity186 : businesses ca n't afford to ignore @entity36 , one - quarter of their market
