flanked by police officers with assault rifles , and riding down a highway in the back of a police pickup , police commissioner @entity0 explains the difficult task of fighting crime			0
" the @entity8 recommends that a city of this size have 4,000 officers , " he says			0
" but i only have 1,000			0
" overrun by drug violence , @entity12 is the second - largest and most violent city in @entity14 -- a country that 's the current murder capital of the world			1
at the end of the first day of shooting for @entity22 's " @entity23 " report , we had arranged to meet the commissioner , expecting a quick interview			1
instead , @entity0 jumped into the back of the police truck , taking correspondent @entity28 and the rest of the @entity22 team onto the streets of @entity12 , a manufacturing city with relatively good infrastructure			0
a convoy of other police vehicles joined us as we set off into the city			0
but instead of a tour , we began following a beat - up maroon truck			0
finally , on the outskirts of the city , we surrounded the vehicle			0
its three occupants were pulled out at gunpoint and forced to lie on the highway			0
we were amazed to capture this all on camera , given how most serious crimes here go unsolved			0
in the next moment , the three were standing up , smiling			0
it turned out the police had staged the takedown to show us their tactics			0
a minute later , a call came in , and we were back in a police pickup , heading to the scene of a real crime : another body dumped , another group of neighbors who had n't seen anything or heard anything , another killing where there was n't going to be a dramatic chase ending with arrests			0
welcome to the most violent region on earth			0
getting away with murder @entity71 are well aware of @entity73 's drug war and the horrific violence that takes place a stone 's throw away from the @entity71			1
but narco - trafficking and violence are n't just confined to @entity73			2
in fact , @entity14 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 all had higher per - capita murder rates than @entity73 in 2010			1
@entity22 's " @entity23 " focuses on @entity14 and @entity82 because these two countries have become the key corridor for cocaine coming to the @entity71 from @entity89			1
this has coincided with a dramatic spike in homicide rates , according to the @entity8			0
in @entity14 , homicides have more than doubled between 2005 and 2010 , the @entity8 reports			1
as a result , the @entity71 @entity94 last weekend pulled more than 150 of its volunteers out of @entity14 while it reviews the security situation there			1
almost every murder in these @entity102 countries goes unsolved			1
the impunity rate -- the rate of serious crimes that go unsolved -- is extremely high , estimated by the @entity8 to be 98 % in @entity82			2
here , the odds are overwhelming that someone can literally get away with murder			2
true , there are other places where the impunity rate is high , such as parts of @entity73 where its drug war rages			1
but in @entity73 , the casualties are the result of a drug war that began with known , organized cartels fighting each other			1
in @entity102 , officials estimate that drug dealing is a factor in 60 % of the killings , but it 's not always clear who 's killing whom and why			1
perhaps a murder is related to a big shipment of cocaine			2
or maybe it 's over a $ 50 drug sale on the sidewalk			2
origins of a drug war it started 30 years ago when hundreds of thousands of @entity102 began immigrating to the @entity71 , many of them illegally			1
some ended up in @entity136 , then the street gang capital of the @entity71 , if not the world			1
some of the immigrants ' children grew up and became gang members			0
they formed two large gangs , @entity143 , also known as @entity143 , and @entity144			0
the neighborhoods where these gangs were based became active areas for the @entity149 's homicide division in the 1990s			2
it was as if @entity102 's civil wars in the 1980s had moved north			1
so the @entity71 deported many of these gang members back to @entity102			1
as a result , @entity143 and @entity144 , originally from @entity136 , became @entity102 gangs			2
the region began to suffer an explosion of robberies , extortion cases and murders perpetrated by gang members			0
the threat was so serious that in 2004 , the @entity163 set up a task force to fight these transnational street gangs across the @entity71 , @entity73 and @entity102			1
by 2005 , homicides in @entity14 had risen to nearly 2,500 a year			1
with the @entity71 working hard to stop trafficking in the @entity167 and @entity89 , @entity102 -- with its disruptive violence and high rate of impunity -- became an attractive alternative route			1
how @entity172 is busting its cartels former @entity175 drug cartel member speaks out by 2011 , the @entity176 estimated that 25 tons of cocaine a month were moving through @entity14			1
and there were close to 7,000 homicides there , a 250 % increase in half a dozen years			2
homicides in neighboring @entity80 reportedly rose to the highest level since that country 's civil war of the 1980s			2
of course , those are just numbers			0
on the ground , the increasing level of violence has created a kind of prison			0
when the sun goes down in @entity12 and @entity194 , the capital of @entity14 , people retreat to their homes as if it were 4 a.m. large sections of city become deserted , and armed guards are everywhere			1
forget ideology : it 's all about dollars it 's easy to say the increase in drug trafficking in @entity102 caused the spike in violence			1
but it 's not entirely clear			2
some analysts say they believe the instability and violence created by the deported gang members paved the way for drug traffickers			2
what is clear is that in the 1980s , the region suffered from civil wars that were ideological in nature			0
in @entity82 and @entity80 , @entity219 guerrillas were fighting governments that were allies of the @entity71			1
@entity14 was relatively more peaceful -- but not entirely as government forces battled @entity219 insurgents to a smaller extent			2
these were classic @entity225 conflicts as the @entity226 and the @entity228 bloc squared off			0
after the @entity228 's collapse in 1991 and the acceleration of globalization , a new symmetry has seemed to shape the violence in @entity14 and @entity82			1
now combatants are fighting over dollars from the lucrative drug trade , which could make it more difficult to establish a long - lasting peace			2
if we look at @entity73 's more clear - cut narco war , consider the situation in @entity240			1
in the fall of 2008 , @entity240 was a city under siege , a ghostly place			0
its public areas were largely deserted after dark			0
two years later , the city was bustling again , with new restaurants open , people out and about , and civic life restored			0
while there are still travel advisories -- including from the @entity71 -- warning visitors to exercise caution in @entity240 , there is a relative peace that authorities publicly credit to their efforts to defeat the cartels			1
the authorities publicly credited the relative peace in @entity240 to their efforts to defeat the cartels			0
people whispered that either the warring cartels had made a truce , or that " one entity has prevailed , " the @entity265 , @entity73 's largest and most dominant , reclaiming its hegemony			1
the violence in @entity82 and @entity14 seems less organized , so the path to peace appears less clear			1
@entity82 has seen some success with pilot programs designed to fight official corruption and to convince citizens to cooperate with authorities			2
@entity14 , with a relatively weak government , so far seems to have little in the way of effective programs to end the violence			2
back in @entity12 , on our first morning there , we visited a violence reduction center supported by the @entity281			0
half a dozen or so police officers carrying assault rifles trailed behind for security as the people at the center walked us a quarter mile down a dusty road to a soccer field that represented their greatest triumph			0
the field used to be deserted because of gang violence in the neighborhood			0
after negotiating with the gangs , they reached an agreement allowing youth soccer leagues to use the field during the day			0
this fragile coexistence -- sharing a soccer field with drug gangs -- could be a small step toward what @entity14 and its neighbors must do to create peace in @entity102 .			1

@entity14 and @entity82 are key corridors for drugs coming to the @entity71 from @entity89
in @entity14 , homicides have more than doubled in five years , making it world 's murder capital
*unlike* @entity73 , there are no big drug cartels battling for control in @entity102
