-- @entity2 tennis has come a long way since some of its top players had to train in empty swimming pools to escape the conflict and bombings on the streets of the country 's capital @entity13			1
world number three and @entity15 champion @entity14 , and former female world number ones @entity16 and @entity18 all grew up at the height of the country 's troubles , but their success at the top of the game has firmly put @entity2 on the map as a tennis superpower			2
and now , as @entity13 plays host to the final of the @entity31 competition , with @entity2 facing nine - time champions of the international men 's team event , @entity35 , the country 's transformation from war - torn nation to tennis - playing giant is almost complete			1
" we all know that the @entity31 is a very special competition and playing in the @entity31 final is the biggest success that my country ever had , " @entity2 world number three @entity14 said at a press conference at the @entity43 in @entity44 , which @entity0 attended			1
@entity13 - born @entity14 , grand slam doubles champion @entity51 , 30th - ranked @entity52 and world number 49 @entity53 make up the team that will hope to secure sporting success for their country in front of a packed crowd at the city 's indoor tennis center			1
the story of @entity14 and his compatriots has inspired many people in the former @entity66 state to take up tennis and the sport is now one of the best - loved in the nation			0
" they are massive massive stars in @entity2 , they are gods , " @entity71 from the @entity2 section of the @entity73 told @entity0			2
" they are viewed as heroes as they are giving the country an identity and something to be proud of			0
their stories are quite inspirational and the tennis schools are filled with young girls and boys who want to play like them			0
" for the men 's players reaching the @entity31 final is seen as culmination of the country 's success in the sport and with the added bonus of being able to contest the tie on home - soil , they are much the favorites to become the most recent tennis heroes in their country			2
" on paper @entity2 is definitely the huge favorite , " @entity71 added			2
" they are very much looking forward to playing on their home court and that should not factor any pressure -- it will only be an advantage for them			1
" the prospect of playing their 16th @entity31 final against some of the world 's top players in front of a partisan @entity2 crowd is something that @entity35 have acknowledged is a tough task -- but not an impossible one			1
" i think that @entity2 are the favorites -- they are at home , " @entity113 from @entity114 @entity35 told @entity0			1
" they have @entity14 who is unbeatable at home and is playing very well			2
so they are favorites but only small favorites i think			0
" with 10 players in the top 100 , @entity35 captain @entity121 had plenty of talent to choose from when it came to picking his squad , although the team will be without former @entity132 finalist and world number 13 @entity129			2
@entity35 number one and world number 12 @entity133 will be joined in the team by @entity137 , @entity138 and doubles specialist @entity139			0
@entity35 will become the third most successful @entity31 country of all - time ( behind @entity141 and the @entity142 ) should the quartet win a tenth title			1
but unlike @entity2 who have a recent major winner in @entity14 , @entity35 is without a men 's champion since @entity149 won at @entity150 in 1983 , and recapturing the the @entity31 is certainly seen as a way to atone for a lack of success in a sport that remains hugely popular in the country			1
" we have a lot of great players in @entity35 but have not been able to win a grand slam			0
we love tennis so we have to hope for victory in the @entity31 to make up for it , " @entity113 added			0
whether @entity35 can add another title to its collection or @entity2 can claim their first remains to be seen			1
but one thing is certain -- both sets of players will be fighting hard to win the @entity31 despite having already competed in an 11 - month long season			0
and playing at home , the @entity2 will be relishing the tie event more as they look to seal their place in @entity31 history			1
" it is maybe a unique opportunity for all of us , " @entity14 said			0
" so we have to find this little piece of energy that is left and give everything on the court			0
" " it is a unique opportunity to have the @entity31 final played at home -- you will never have this opportunity again			0
we all are looking forward to that .			0

the final of the @entity190 takes place in @entity13 from 3 - 5 *december*
@entity2 and @entity35 will meet in the competition for the first time
@entity35 have won the event nine times most recently in 2001
@entity2 will be playing in the final for the first time but have the advantage of playing on their home court
