@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 on thursday warned @entity3 of serious consequences if it rejects an offer to hold talks about the dire situation at their shared manufacturing zone where @entity10 has halted activity amid recent tensions			1
the @entity14 spokesman @entity13 urged the @entity15 to respond to the offer of talks over the zone , the @entity19 , by noon on friday			1
@entity13 said that if @entity10 turns down the offer , @entity0 would have no choice but to take " grave " measures			1

seen as the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries , the @entity19 complex is a joint economic zone on the @entity15 's side of the border that houses the operations of more than 120 @entity1 companies			1
earlier this month , during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at @entity1 and the @entity34 , the @entity15 began blocking @entity1 from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border			2
it then pulled out the more than 50,000 @entity3 who work in the zone 's factories , saying it was temporarily suspending activity there			0
since the @entity15 started preventing people from entering the zone from the @entity1 side , the number of @entity43 in there has steadily dwindled from more than 800 before the crisis began			2
as of wednesday , 176 @entity1 and one @entity50 person remained in the @entity19 complex , according to @entity1 authorities			0
