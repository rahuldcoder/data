@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's most celebrated fugitive -- " the last of the gentlemen crooks , " as he liked to describe himself -- was born @entity6 in @entity7 , south @entity1 , on august 8 , 1929			1
@entity6 spent more than three decades as a fugitive after escaping from prison in 1964			1
the youngest of five children , his criminal career began at the age of 15 when he was arrested for stealing pencils from a local shop			0
he joined the @entity16 in 1947 but was dishonourably discharged two years later after being convicted of breaking into a chemist 's shop while @entity19			2
the latter offence resulted in his first spell in prison -- four months in @entity23			2
he was released in june 1949 , but was back in jail within a month for car theft			2
this second prison term -- also at @entity27 -- was to change @entity6 ' life			1
he met and became friends with @entity30 , the man who later masterminded the heist commonly known as the @entity32			1
between 1949 and 1963 @entity6 was regularly involved in criminal activity -- he served several jail sentences -- although he also made money legally working as a painter and decorator			1
in 1960 he married @entity38 with whom he had three children -- @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
the couple were subsequently estranged			0
on august 8 , 1963 -- @entity6 ' birthday -- he was one of a gang of 16 who held up the @entity49 to @entity1 mail train , escaping with a record haul of more than £ 2.6 million ( $ 4.4 million )			1
he was arrested a month later after his fingerprint was found on some stolen notes , and in january 1964 he was sentenced to 30 years in prison			1
after serving only 15 months , however , he made a daring escape from @entity56 in south @entity1 , thus beginning 35 years on the run			2
his first stop was @entity59 , where he spent much of his £ 147,000 ( $ 246,000 ) cut of the train robbery money on plastic surgery and acquiring papers to @entity64			0
he remained in @entity65 until 1969 , working as a builder , before he slipped out of the country using a false passport on a ship bound for @entity70			0
there followed brief spells in @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 before he eventually settled in @entity76 , @entity77			1
in 1974 he was arrested and faced being sent back to the @entity4			1
his @entity77 girlfriend @entity78 , however , was by that point pregnant with his child , and under @entity77 law that meant he could not be deported			2
further attempts were made to bring him back to @entity0 , including a highly publicized kidnapping in 1981 when he was seized by adventurers hoping to claim a reward for his capture			0
he was taken to @entity87 in a sack marked " @entity89 , " but subsequently released due to a loophole in @entity87 law			0
in the meantime , he became something of a celebrity in @entity76			0

@entity6 suffered a minor stroke in march 1998 , and with his health and finances failing he finally returned to the @entity4 in 2001			1
his estranged wife @entity108 said at the time : " the man i remember was a strong , fit , big man who could take on the world			0
now he looks like a walking corpse , just skin and bone			0
i feel so sorry and sad for him			0
" @entity6 and his family campaigned for him to be released because of his poor health virtually from the day he returned to the @entity4 and was immediately incarcerated in @entity119 high security prison			1
instead , @entity6 was moved to a prison facility for elderly prisoners in @entity123 , his parole prospects dismissed by justice ministers because of his apparent lack of remorse			1
but on august 4 @entity6 was moved to a hospital suffering with severe pneumonia			2
on august 7 , the eve of both his 80th birthday and the 46th anniversary of the heist that turned him into a fugitive , @entity6 was formally released on compassionate grounds			1
in 2001 @entity6 said his last wish was to buy a pint of beer in a pub in the southern seaside resort of @entity140			1
but @entity6 ' legal advisor @entity141 told journalists that @entity6 was unlikely to ever leave his hospital bed			2
" this man is ill , he 's going to die , he is not going to any pub or going to @entity76			0
he is going to stay in hospital , " said @entity141 .			0
