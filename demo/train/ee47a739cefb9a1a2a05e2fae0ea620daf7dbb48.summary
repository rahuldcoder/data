-- @entity1 is rumored to be announcing a choice soon for his vice presidential running mate , and conventional thinking suggests his pick is going to be " safe , " someone who brings a high measure of conservative street cred , and preferably from a swing state			1
in other words , the rumor is the guy who has trouble getting people to like him is going to pick someone even more boring than him			2
it seems he has n't figured out that as long as @entity20 is president , his base will be fired up in spite of his dull personality , so what he does n't need to do is waste this pick on a running mate @entity27 will like			1
what he needs is someone who can attract voters on the fence			2
a media darling with a successful track record to point to and someone whose social politics wo n't immediately get them labeled by independents as " crazy			2
" @entity1 risks playing running mate hand too early enter @entity36 : that union - fighting / gay - couple - loving renegade who would make things complicated for @entity42 because he 's managed to get elected three times in the most diverse region in the country while being a rich , old white guy			1
four years ago , sen. @entity47 selected a game changer who turned out to be better in theory than in practice			2
like @entity53 , @entity52 would be a curve ball			1
but while she got people talking , the @entity56 mayor would get people talking and thinking			0
how ? by being something many of the other vp options are not : a real @entity27			0
who will run with @entity1 ? @entity1 could go with the current @entity27 incarnation of the anti-tax , @entity65 thumper who would demonize social programs , but most everyone would see that as pandering , not problem solving			1
@entity52 is viewed as a compassionate leader with many traditional @entity27 views who would be focused on reducing deficits by increasing revenue in addition to making tough decisions on spending cuts			1
you know , like that @entity81 guy the new generation idolizes but is reluctant to emulate			0
remember @entity81 raised taxes to help dig us out of a hole			0
and while he does n't like to talk about it , when @entity1 was governor , he too raised taxes			1
and if you comb through this country 's history , you will see that raising taxes is not the @entity42 ' way of exchanging wealth , it 's been a reoccurring part of the deficit reduction equation and -- in the mayor 's words -- " republicans who emphasize economic freedom would have a lot more credibility if they 'd stop promising a free lunch			0
" @entity36 did n't say that four years ago			1
he did n't say that last year			2
he wrote that in a @entity105 op - ed in march			0
that 's the kind of honest assessment voters on the fence are looking for			0
they 're not married to a party			0
they 're not looking for partisan cheerleaders			0
they already see the writing on the wall			0
they 're just waiting to see which candidate is going to be courageous enough to read it out loud			0
for his part , @entity36 has already said he felt @entity1 would do a better job of running the country than @entity20			1
but the reason why he has n't endorsed the former @entity124 governor is because of @entity1 's social politics , which used to be more in line with @entity52 's before he started pandering to the religious right			1
however , after nearly eight years of campaigning for president , the one thing that should be clear to @entity1 at this point is that the religious right does n't like him			1
it 's just tolerating him because it dislikes @entity20 more			1
and picking a safe , religious conservative running mate is not going to make @entity1 any more attractive to his reluctant base , and it does n't matter because these people are already resigned to voting for him			1
but it does run the risk of alienating independents who are leery of a social policy agenda hijacking the attention that needs to be directed at the economy			0
in the fall of 2010 , @entity27 came storming back into power under the guise of creating jobs and fixing the economy			0
by the spring , we nearly had a government shutdown over the party 's obsession with @entity152 during budget talks			0
the country can not afford another platform bait - and - switch			0
so if planting that leak of @entity158 being on the shortlist of running mates was @entity162 's way of getting the attention off his tax returns and his time at @entity166 , it was a very good effort			2
but that distraction is going to be short - lived if he pulls a name such as @entity170 or @entity172 insider @entity171 out of the hat			0
they may be safe , but safe is not what @entity1 needs			1
safe is n't what the country needs			1
safe is n't going to solve our economic problems , and safe is definitely not going to win the @entity184			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity187 : many expect @entity1 to pick a " safe " conservative running mate
he says @entity1 does n't need to rally the support of base that already opposes @entity20
a *smarter* move would be for @entity1 to choose @entity36 , @entity187 says
@entity187 : @entity52 pick would gain independent support , help show *seriousness*
