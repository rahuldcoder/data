president @entity0 has weighed in			1
the pro football commissioner , has too			2
and now , a @entity3 tribe hopes recent attention to controversy surrounding the name of @entity9 's @entity8 team will provide the momentum needed to get it changed			1
as @entity8 executives arrived in the nation 's capital for their annual fall meeting on monday , the @entity12 held a symposium in town to discuss their campaign to find a new name for the @entity21 after 80 years			1
" we are asking the @entity8 to stop using a racial slur as the name of @entity9 's football team , " said @entity12 representative @entity22			1
the " @entity27 " campaign launched last month with a string of radio ads airing in @entity9 and cities where the @entity21 play this season			1
the @entity8 executives were invited to the symposium , but @entity22 said none attended			1
in an interview with the @entity35 last week , @entity0 said if he were the owner of the @entity21 and he knew the name was " offending a sizable group of people , " then he would " think about changing it			1
" @entity22 began his remarks by thanking the president for weighing in			2
" as the first sitting president to speak out against the @entity9 team name , president @entity0 's comments over the weekend were nothing less than historic , " @entity22 said			1
" is n't that the real issue ? no matter what the history of something is , if it 's offending people , then it 's time to change it			0
and this is a great time to do it			0
" @entity0 on the @entity21 a @entity57 poll from june indicated that two - thirds of people who live in the @entity9 metropolitan area did n't want the @entity21 to change their name , but more than eight in 10 said it would n't make much of a difference to them if the name were changed			1
last month , @entity8 commissioner @entity67 , who had previously expressed support for the team mascot , changed his tone on the " the @entity71 with @entity72 " on @entity73 in @entity9			1
" i want all of us to go out and make sure we 're listening to our fans , listening to people of a different view , and making sure that we continue to do what 's right to make sure that team represents the strong tradition and history that it has for so many years , " @entity67 said			1
the @entity8 confirmed on monday that it would meet with @entity12 leaders			2
but @entity21 owner @entity83 has steadfastly refused to consider it , telling @entity85 last spring that he will " never " change his team 's name , even if they lose an ongoing federal trademark lawsuit that would stop the @entity8 team from exclusively profiting from the @entity21 name			1
in addition to the federal trademark lawsuit , a group of @entity93 lawmakers drafted a bill last spring to cancel trademark registrations that use the name " @entity21			2
" two of them , @entity97 rep. @entity97 of the @entity9 , and rep. @entity99 of @entity100 attended monday 's forum to voice their support			0
@entity9 council member pushes name change for @entity21 @entity99 , who is co-chair of the @entity106 , said the use of the @entity21 name is " exploitation perpetrated for profit by the @entity8 and @entity83 's football business			1
" " mr. @entity83 , change the mascot			0
end this ugly history and tradition of your team 's racial slur			0
pick one that offends no one , hurts no one , dehumanizes no one			0
it is time to put dignity and respect for native @entity93 people ahead of your profits , " @entity99 said			0
@entity83 did not respond to a request for comment from @entity130			0
but @entity21 attorney @entity131 said @entity22 is being " selective in his outrage , " citing other teams named after @entity134 who are not targeted in the " @entity27 " campaign			2
" why is he not protesting the @entity137 , or president @entity0 's hometown @entity138 ? " @entity131 said			1
while @entity22 said that there are certain @entity3 names that " can be unifying and respectful , " he maintains that the @entity21 name is " a dictionary defined racial epithet , " that should n't be used to " sell a national sports team to @entity93 or to the rest of the world			1
" @entity21 ' owner : ' we will never change the name of the team ' " @entity9 's continued use of the current team name is not just a slur against one group of people , it has demonstrable and serious public policy cultural educational , public health ramifications for our entire country , " @entity22 said			1
critics argue that the @entity21 ' name is based on a historically offensive slur and presents negative identity issues for @entity134 , a community already distressed by a slew of public health and social crises including high rates of poverty , diabetes , and suicide			2
dr. @entity174 , a clinical psychologist who attended the forum , called @entity83 's refusal to consider calls for a name change " textbook bullying			0
" " experimental study after experimental study shows that if you bring a @entity3 person into an experimental situation and you show them an image of a @entity3 mascot , their self - esteem goes down , their faith in their community goes down , their feeling that they can achieve goes down , " @entity174 said			0
but @entity131 said @entity174 is ignoring other data that shows @entity134 are not insulted by the name			0
" i ask him , since there 's no intent to disparage or disrespect - and i certainly respect those , and am sorry for those , who are offended - why is he selecting the @entity21 ? does he see the @entity137 of the @entity204 fans ? they 're doing that not out of disrespect			2
" other at the forum , like @entity210 , said the intent behind keeping the name does n't matter			0
" i want to say this to @entity21 fans			2
no one blames you for having used a name that was always used as this team			0
they will only blame you if you continue to use it and if you use it will impunity , " she said			0
the @entity222 were in @entity223 before the @entity9 franchise was born in 1933			0
