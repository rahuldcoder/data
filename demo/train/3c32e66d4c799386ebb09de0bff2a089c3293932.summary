-- @entity1 is , uh , back			1
and so is the whole " @entity7 " universe : morphing machines , the industrious version of @entity5 and a sometimes - befuddled @entity6			0
the trailer for " terminator : @entity13 " hit the web on thursday , and it appears to have amped up the action to video game levels			1
how else to explain @entity1 's old - style @entity9 -- who has apparently raised young @entity5 -- hurtling through the air into the blades of a helicopter ? ( it 's ok			1
he 'll repair himself , right ? right ? ) of course , there are still the " @entity7 " touchstones : post-apocalyptic landscapes , a naked @entity6 showing up in 1980s @entity21 , crazy physics - defying stunts ( how about that school bus ? ) and a blade - equipped @entity25			0
and , yes , @entity1 , looking a little older but still as determined as ever			1
" i 'll be back , " he says before leaping into that helicopter			2
" terminator : @entity13 " has some changes in store , producer @entity28 told @entity31 in october			1
" since ( @entity5 ) was 9 years old , she has been told everything that was supposed to happen , " he said			0
" but @entity5 fundamentally rejects that destiny			0
she says , ' that 's not what i want to do			0
' it 's her decision that drives the story in a very different direction			0
" the film stars @entity42 as @entity43 and @entity44 as @entity6			2
it 's scheduled to open july 1 .			2

" terminator : @entity13 " trailer shows older @entity1
@entity1 is still in *fighting* form , *plunging* into helicopter
new film is *due* out in july
