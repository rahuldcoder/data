-- @entity1 has been mayor of @entity2 , @entity3 -- twice			1
both times , he left under a dark cloud after being convicted of crimes he committed while in office			0
now , he wants back in			0
@entity1 announced wednesday on his weekday radio show that he intends to seek a third go as the mayor of @entity3 's capital and biggest city , feeling he 's the best bet for @entity2 's future regardless of his own past			1
" today with a sense of humility , contrition and confidence i announce to you my candidacy for mayor of @entity2 , " the 73 - year - old @entity1 said on @entity17			1
he was an @entity24 veteran and prosecutor when he became mayor the first time in 1975 , quickly establishing himself as a character and significant actor in the @entity30 city			0
things came tumbling down in 1983 , when he was indicted for extortion , assault with a dangerous weapon , kidnapping , conspiracy and simple assault			1
that stemmed from an incident that year at his @entity2 home , in which he used his hands and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his estranged wife , with a uniformed policeman nearby -- an account detailed in court records and documented by then - @entity51 reporter @entity50			1
he pleaded nolo contendere , or no contest , the following year to one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault , according to court documents			0
as part of the plea deal , @entity1 never went to prison -- getting five years of probation on the assault with a dangerous weapon charge and one year 's probation on the simple assault charge -- but was forced to leave his job as mayor			1
still , @entity1 did n't go away completely			2
he remained very much a part of the @entity2 landscape and a fixture on talk radio			2
and soon after his probation was over , @entity1 was elected mayor once again			1
he stayed in that position for 11 more years , continuing to push the redevelopment and becoming a celebrity of sorts -- with a signature marinara sauce and guest spots on the @entity82 show " @entity2			1
" but @entity1 's tenure in office ended abruptly , as part of what was known as @entity87			1
that led to his conviction in 2002 on federal corruption charge , earning him a sentence of five years and four months in prison , plus two years probation and a $ 100,000 fine			0
at his sentencing , @entity95 district judge @entity94 credited the then - mayor 's " rare vision and boundless energy " and his " great role in the renaissance of the city			2
" " it is not an understatement to say that this is @entity106 , " @entity94 added , saying it was his job to sentence " mr. @entity108			0
" reflecting on his past wednesday , @entity1 told @entity0 affiliate @entity110			2
" i understand it comes with baggage , but i think people have to take you for who you are			0
" they know me from head to toe			0
" @entity1 joins six other candidates aiming for the office			2
" there are some of you that may say that this is an 11th hour decision but i assure you it was not made irrationally or in haste , " said @entity1			0
" rather it has been conceived with much soul searching and reflection			0
" during his announcement on wednesday , @entity1 acknowledged that he will be scrutinized for this decision and even hinted at his previous experiences as his foundation for being a worthy candidate			0
" experience is a great teacher , but often a painful one , " he said .			1

@entity1 has had two runs as mayor of @entity2 , @entity3
both tenures ended after he was indicted -- once for assault , next for corruption
now , @entity1 says he *'ll* run again for mayor of @entity2
" experience is a great teacher , but often a painful one , " he said
