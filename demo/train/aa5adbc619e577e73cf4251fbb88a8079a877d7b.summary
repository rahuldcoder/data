the president bobbed his head to the music and clapped			0
young girls danced with baskets on their heads as the room erupted in cheers			0
at one point , students pulled the first lady on stage and taught her how to twirl			0
" notice they did n't ask me , " the president said			0
students later extended the offer to the president , who joined them and towered over the youngsters as he danced			2
@entity3 also visited students at @entity36 , where students in school uniforms explained their projects to the president			2
one girl described her " eco-friendly village " with a large windmill			0
" did you guys get that -- a tree a day keeps global warming away , " @entity3 told journalists			0
@entity3 also attended an agriculture exposition and took part in a town hall - style meeting with students at @entity54 in @entity55			0
he and the first lady then visited @entity57 , a magnificent architectural precursor to the @entity59 , before heading to @entity0 for a private dinner sunday night with @entity1 prime minister @entity61			1
at the meeting with the students , @entity3 faced some difficult questions including his thoughts about jihad and why the @entity4 does n't consider @entity67 -- @entity1 's neighbor and rival -- a terrorist state			1
the president said it was necessary to isolate those who distort religion as a means for war , and said young people have a role in rejecting violence as a way to mediate differences			0
on @entity67 , @entity3 called it a country of enormous potential that had extremist elements			0
he acknowledged that progress against militants there was " not as quick as we 'd like , " particularly in the difficult terrain of the northwest territories along the border with @entity92			0
@entity3 also said that @entity1 has the biggest stake in its neighbor 's success , and that he hoped over time that the two nations develop further trust and cooperation			2
" the @entity4 stands to be a partner in that process , but ca n't impose that , " @entity3 said			2
the relatively light agenda on the second day of @entity3 's 10 - day , four - nation @entity104 trip followed the president 's unveiling saturday of about $ 10 billion in contracts for @entity4 exports to @entity1			1
" the @entity4 sees @entity104 , and especially @entity1 , as a market of the future , " @entity3 said at a meeting with business leaders from both countries			1
" for @entity4 , this is a jobs strategy			2
" promoting broader trade relations with @entity1 is a delicate balancing act for @entity3 , given @entity4 frustration with the outsourcing of jobs to call centers in the country			1
but @entity3 said the notion of @entity1 outsourcing being a net drain on the @entity4 economy is part of a " caricature of @entity1 as a land of call centers and back offices that cost @entity4 jobs			1
" @entity3 's three - day visit to @entity1 , @entity104 's third largest economy and one of the world 's few growth markets , also will include bilateral talks with @entity61 and an address to the the nation 's parliament			1
