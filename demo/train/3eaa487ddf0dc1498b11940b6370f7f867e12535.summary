-- @entity2 fans and students knew the @entity5 report was going to be harsh , but even so , it exceeded their expectations			1
yet , for a significant number of them , their respect for the late @entity8 is unchanged			1
the lengthy report was released thursday morning , castigating four former university officials -- president @entity13 , vice president @entity14 , athletic director @entity15 and @entity8 -- for their roles in dealing with former coach @entity19 , who now sits in prison for abusing boys , some on the @entity2 campus			1
" i think @entity8 's career here at @entity2 has been unique because he was able to build an athletic program that helped improve academics , which is rare for a university , " @entity22 , a @entity2 graduate , told @entity0 's @entity23			1
" so it 's hard for a lot of people who have been ingrained over those decades to hear his name not used in the best of light			1
" @entity5 's prepared statement ( @entity36 ) student @entity37 was glad the truth had " finally come out			1
" he said it was sobering to read how officials appeared to be more interested in preventing bad publicity			2
" it really seems like everybody was just focused on something else , not the victims , " he said			0
" it 's just sad because the kids , they were lost in all this			2
and i think it 's really important that we move forward and make sure that this stuff does not happen again			0
" @entity2 leaders disregarded victims , ' empowered ' @entity19 , review finds his sentiment was echoed by the @entity57 , a group that also has members who were molested at camps and in athletic programs			1
the group released a statement that said the report was a good step , but change was more important			1
" often , we assume that when a scandal is exposed , reform will result , but that 's not necessarily true			0
information sometimes leads to action , but sometimes not , " the statement read			0
" @entity2 students , staff and alumni must continue to push hard for practical changes to the unhealthy , self - protective institutional culture at the school that endangers kids			1
at a glance : key players in @entity2 report " for starters , top school officials need to be prosecuted as vigorously as possible and punished as severely as possible			1
that is perhaps the best way to deter future cover - ups			0
" @entity88 attorney general @entity87 said : " today 's release of the @entity90 will not hinder the continuing work of our statewide investigating grand jury , nor will it impact ongoing criminal prosecutions			0
" according to a statement from her office , @entity96 has promised to turn over any material related to criminal conduct to her investigators			0
former student @entity104 said he will maintain his deep pride in his university			2
@entity8 defended @entity2 in letter he wrote before his death " i received my diploma in may and it says ' the @entity2 ' not ' @entity110 , ' " he said			1
" the university is not defined by one name or the actions of a few			2
" there are so many other things to be proud of , @entity104 said : the $ 10.6 million the university raised to help fight pediatric cancer , the $ 500,000 it raised for the @entity116			0
" we can either put our heads down in shame and say , ' how are we ever going to recover from this ? ' or we can raise our heads and say , ' ok , how are we going to come out of this ? ' and start recovering , " he said			0
key passages from the report " it certainly hurts			0
you ca n't not be hurt by this , but at the same time i think what 's important now is just moving forward , " he said			0
there is a healing power in a community where there is a common goal , a common passion , he said , and he senses that among the @entity2 community			2
@entity37 said there was an opportunity for students to " really make up for what these administrators have done and have failed to do			0
" a few dozen students and fans wanted to watch news of the release of the report on wednesday morning at a @entity2 student center , but according to the @entity154 , just before a @entity0 anchor started talking about it , the channel changed to a public access show			1
a student worker at the help desk said a university employee was in charge of what channel was on			2
that person was in a meeting , the report said			0
on social media , supporters duked it out with critics and commentators weighed in on what they thought the future will or should hold for @entity2			2
while some called for @entity2 dropping football , a reporter who covers the @entity176 's @entity175 , said , " forget the " @entity177 " for @entity2 ... let them play and make millions ... and make them donate every damn $ to stopping child abuse			1
" @entity0 's @entity23 contributed to this report .			0
