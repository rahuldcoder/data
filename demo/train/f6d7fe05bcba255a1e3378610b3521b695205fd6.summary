-- images of @entity3 's aftermath in the @entity4 appear so devastatingly apocalyptic that most @entity4 - @entity5 remain on edge			1
what news does get out only makes the situation seem more unbearable , especially when @entity0 viewers see typhoon survivors such as @entity11 make anguished pleas in televised reports			2
" get international help to come here now , not tomorrow , now , " @entity11 said			2
" this is really , really like bad , worse than hell			0
" if only loved ones could hear a more reassuring message			2
but personal communication is slow in coming			0
relatives in the @entity5 and around the world are turning to social media sites such as @entity24 , reading @entity4 - based media sites ( such as @entity27 's major newspaper , the @entity26 ) for news , all while waiting for that phone call , text or any kind of message from an unaccounted loved one			1
because of infrastructure failures , only a few individuals from the most ravaged areas such as @entity35 in the @entity37 area of the central @entity4 are able to communicate by cell or land line			1
@entity41 : are you searching for a family member in the @entity4 ? while the @entity45 is in rubble , the @entity44 is in the dark			1
nearly half of all the 3.4 million @entity4 - @entity5 live in @entity49			1
among them is @entity51 , who waits for news from her home in @entity54			0
@entity51 , 52 , executive director of a historical project that preserves images of @entity58 - @entity5 life and connects @entity59 to @entity35 's main region , @entity37 , has heard from just one family member			2
but that 's just a single strand of a large extended family in the @entity4			1
@entity51 was born in the @entity5 , but her mother , @entity65 , 94 , immigrated to the @entity5 in the 1940s from @entity35			0
like many @entity4 , @entity67 came with only one of her younger brothers , meaning there are many relatives still living in @entity35 and the surrounding area			1
" my mom is so worried , " @entity51 said			2
" she just gets up every day and prays			0
" the first positive sign came when another cousin in @entity54 was able to confirm on @entity24 and through text messages that her cousin @entity77 and husband @entity77 were both able to leave @entity35 safely this weekend			0
" she said they just could n't stay , " @entity51 said			0
" it smelled too much like death			0
" another set of cousins , @entity85 and a younger relative , were ok , too			0
@entity51 said they were on a motorcycle on the road from @entity90 to @entity91 , another part of @entity37			0
@entity51 said that trip usually takes an hour , but it took five hours in the aftermath of the storm			0
" they said there were just too many bodies all around , " @entity51 said about her cousin 's experience			0
" the bodies were just piled up on the road			0
" now the focus is on finding another cousin from @entity35 proper			0
but no one has heard from him			0
" @entity108 is an engineer in his late 50s , " @entity51 said			0
" his daughter @entity110 is missing , too			0
where they are ? we just do n't know			0
" the @entity4 @entity114 has reportedly set up a call service at 09175328500			1
the @entity26 also reported that @entity116 has set up a person finder at 16508003977 , where one enters " search ( the person 's name ) " into @entity116			0
@entity41 : home ' wiped out , ' but family is alive but with news images looking increasingly grim , and another storm coming , hope is girded by more prayer			2
that 's tough when even @entity37 's @entity130 had its roof and ceiling blown away by the super typhoon , which is known as @entity3 in the @entity4			1
the government is well aware of the country 's vulnerability to natural disasters			2
sure enough , @entity3 , the third major typhoon to hit the @entity4 in three years , comes at a huge financial cost			1
the @entity4 has about $ 500 million to take care of infrastructure issues			1
the personal needs of the population will have to be made up from individual @entity4 throughout the world			1
the country 's 10 million overseas workers already provide the @entity4 with $ 24 billion in remittances			1
it 's much needed when about a third of the people in the @entity4 live in poverty , existing on $ 2 a day			1
the @entity5 government has already committed $ 20 million to help the @entity4			1
@entity4 - @entity5 will also be counted on to pitch in , perhaps even more than they already do			2
the struggling country boasted a first - quarter gross domestic product growth of around 7.8 % , outpacing @entity155 as well as @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158			1
president @entity161 , with an aggressive pro-business and clean government platform , seemed to be getting the country back on its feet			1
@entity41 : ' all i could do was say a prayer ' @entity4 have always been a tough people			1
but the typhoon has brought despair			0
we need everyone who can to help the survivors and country get back on track			1
in the meantime , loved ones anxiously hope that messages from relatives will come soon			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2
