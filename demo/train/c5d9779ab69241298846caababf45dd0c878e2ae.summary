-- six males potentially exposed to radioactive material stashed inside a stolen truck were examined at a @entity5 hospital on friday , a day after authorities said they 'd recovered all of the potentially deadly substance			1
all six tested at @entity11 were negative for radiation poisoning , @entity10 state health official @entity9 said			1
they were released around 6:10 p.m. ( 7:10 p.m. et ) , the state 's health agency said in a statement			1
after their release , the six were to be interrogated by authorities to determine if they were involved in the theft of @entity20 , said @entity21 , a spokesman for @entity5 's attorney general 's office			1
the six live near where the dangerous material had been , though @entity9 said only one showed symptoms such as nausea and headaches consistent with radiation poisoning			1
they were taken to @entity30 , in the state capital of @entity10 , by federal police officers , according to the state health agency			1
earlier friday , the state - run @entity35 news agency quoted @entity9 as saying the six -- ages 16 , 22 , 24 , 25 , 37 and 38 -- had apparently come into contact with or otherwise been in the vicinity of @entity20 about 12 hours after the truck containing it was stolen monday in @entity42			1
news of the hospitalizations first surfaced on @entity45			2
that came after @entity5 authorities announced they recovered all the radioactive material			1
but officials have n't said yet if those responsible for taking it have been caught or even identified			2
the missing vehicle , along with most of the missing radioactive element used for medical purposes , was located in a remote area in @entity56 about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) from where it was taken			1
all of the radioactive material was accounted for in that same area early thursday evening			1
@entity5 authorities told the @entity61 that the truck , which was transporting the material from a hospital in @entity65 to a radioactive waste storage center , was stolen monday			1
@entity67 is located some 55 kilometers north of @entity68 and 48 kilometers from @entity11			1
the container holding the @entity20 was found about a kilometer ( half a mile ) from the truck and had been opened , said @entity71 , head of @entity5 's @entity72			1
there was less than 40 grams ( 1.4 ounces ) of the hazardous material inside the capsule			2
the @entity10 health agency said friday that residents of @entity56 and surrounding areas do n't face any significant health risks due to the material , assuming they did n't contact it directly			1
where are the thieves ? authorities -- who have said they expect that the thieves will turn up to get medical treatment for possible radiation exposure -- have not announced explicitly that anyone has been caught			2
but the @entity35 article detailing the hospitalizations did state that a 25 - year - old man and a 16 - year - old boy are in federal police custody			1
the report did not say why they 'd been detained , only that the @entity97 will soon have more details			2
nor was there an indication whether the two were among those hospitalized in @entity11 , the capital of @entity10 state			1
the attorney general office 's organized crime division is investigating the case , according to @entity21			0
he added that the driver of the stolen truck continues to cooperate with authorities			1
cleanup authorities are guarding the area and have set up a 500 - meter ( 550 - yard ) perimeter around it near the city of @entity56 , @entity113 said			0
they are evaluating whether any residents were exposed , but none has tested positive for radiation , according to the civil protection office			2
cleaning up the area could take weeks , he said , because they do n't have robotic equipment they would need to quickly collect the dangerous cobalt			0
they 're coming up with a plan and considering asking for help from the @entity61 , the @entity132 or @entity133			0
an early theory is that the thieves were unaware of what exactly they had taken			0
" at the time the truck was stolen , the source was properly shielded , " the @entity61 said			1
" however , the source could be extremely dangerous to a person if removed from the shielding , or if it was damaged			0
" but @entity113 said the truck was n't properly set up to transport the radioactive material , since it did n't have a gps for tracking or other necessary equipment			1
uses for cobalt - 60 @entity20 is used in radiotherapy and in industrial tools such as leveling devices and thickness gauges			0
large sources of @entity20 are used to sterilize certain foods , as the gamma rays kill bacteria but do n't damage the product , according to the @entity132 @entity156			0
if released into the environment , the radioactive material can harm people			1
and experts consider cobalt - 60 one of the " candidates " for making dirty bombs			0
bombs made with @entity20 " pose a threat mainly because even a fraction of a gram emits a huge number of high - energy gamma rays ; such material is harmful whether outside or inside the body , " according to a 2011 report by the @entity172			2
in a speech last year , the @entity61 director warned that such a dirty bomb " detonated in a major city could cause mass panic , as well as serious economic and environmental consequences			0
" preliminary information suggests that the thieves did not know what the truck 's cargo was when they stole it , said @entity185 , deputy director of radiological security at the @entity187			2
the shielding that protects the @entity20 is designed so that the radioactive source is difficult to extract , @entity188 said			2
the casing is designed not to be opened or perforated easily			0
the theft the truck and its cargo went missing early monday after the driver of the white 2007 @entity199 truck and an assistant had stopped to rest at a gas station , local prosecutor @entity194 said			2
about 1 a.m. monday , a man armed with a handgun knocked on the passenger window			0
when the passenger rolled down his window , the gunman demanded the keys to the vehicle , @entity205 said			0
both the driver and his assistant were taken to an empty lot where they were bound and told not to move			0
they heard one of the assailants use a walkie - talkie type device or phone to tell someone , " it 's done , " @entity205 said			0
@entity5 alerted the @entity61 to the theft , following international protocol , @entity188 said			0
the @entity132 @entity225 is assisting with the investigation into the stolen truck , @entity5 authorities said			1
the @entity132 government has sensors at border crossings and sea ports to prevent radioactive materials from entering the country			2
this includes large stationary sensors designed to scan vehicles going through land border crossings as well as pager - size devices carried by agents			0
some of this equipment is sensitive enough that it has been set off by people who had recently undergone radiation therapy , according to a @entity132 law - enforcement source			0
according to the @entity172 report , in @entity247 in 2000 , a disused cobalt - 60 source was stored outdoors and bought by two scrap collectors , who took it to a junkyard where it was cut open			0
some workers suffered burn - like injuries , and eventually three people died and seven others suffered radiation injuries , the report says			0
nearly 2,000 others who lived nearby were exposed to radiation			0
@entity0 's @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0

new : the males tested at hospital ranged in age from 16 to 38
federal police took the six to the @entity11 hospital , state health agency says
official : the six will be interrogated now that they *'ve* been medically cleared
