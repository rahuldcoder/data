-- @entity2 's favorite new resident , a giant inflatable duck , took a turn for the worse on wednesday , looking less like an oversized lovable plaything and more like an unappetizing fried egg on the water			1
the 16.5 - meter ( 54 feet ) inflatable sculpture mysteriously lost its mojo overnight , deflated and bobbed lifelessly in @entity10			1
organizers called an urgent duck crisis meeting early wednesday and did n't immediately respond to questions about the misfortunes of the duck or whether the deflation was part of regular maintenance , as reported in some local media			1
a tweet did appear however on the official @entity22 account , saying : " the @entity23 needs to freshen up			2
stay tuned for its return			2
" much later in the day , organizers responded and said it was a planned deflation			1
why it took so long to clarify and why officials had to get senior management approval to make such a statement seems a little odd and naturally , this got @entity33 's busy with the popular pastime of gossiping			2
the duck has captivated @entity2 since its arrival earlier this month and news of the duck 's deflation was splashed across @entity2 media and social networks with many ruminating as to the duck 's health			1
called " @entity23 , " it 's the product of @entity48 artist @entity47			2
after going on show on may 2 , it was to be on display until june 9			1
the artist told @entity0 earlier this month the duck was built locally so it would be easier to fix should there be any duck drama			1
@entity2 is the latest port of call for the duck			1
it 's previously taken up temporary residence in cities all over the world , including @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
the duck has n't always enjoyed plain sailing			1
in 2009 during a port call in @entity70 , it was stabbed 42 times by a vandal			0
" we do n't know why the person did it , " @entity47 said			0
" but in the @entity77 there was a moment when they ruined all the sculptures in @entity81			0
we call it a " sculpture storm			0
" the museum that bought the work spoke about ' @entity86 ' that would hit the work - and kill it			0
" " but [ the incident ] brought the people of that town together			0
the community had a stake out at night and protected it and even the police looked after it			0
it shows that this piece of art means a lot to people in the vicinity of this work			0
" the duck team also closely monitor the weather after the duck copped some nasty treatment during a storm in @entity70			2
" there is a crew that has wind speed meters and they follow what the weather does , " @entity47 said			0
" they monitor by computer and monitor the weather so they can react in advance because we do n't want to cry if it gets ripped up			0
