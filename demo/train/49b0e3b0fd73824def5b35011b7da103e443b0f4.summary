in the audio message , the @entity8 - based militant group @entity7 , or @entity9 , allegedly announces its allegiance to @entity0 , which calls itself the @entity12			1
the roughly 10 - minute clip blames tyrants and their " jewish agents and their allies " for decades of @entity18 suffering			0
the message also calls @entity0 " the emergence of a new dawn			1
" if verified , this would be a new , dangerous chapter for the deadliest group in @entity4			1
since 2012 , @entity9 's attacks have grown more daring and sophisticated			0
the group has killed hundreds of @entity4 police officers and soldiers			1
the largest attack was last month in the @entity8 , killing at least 31 soldiers			0
analysts put the group 's numbers at from the hundreds to roughly a thousand			0
while @entity9 's attacks , until now , have almost exclusively targeted the @entity4 government , there is growing fear that an association with @entity0 could expand the threat to civilian and tourist sites			1
@entity4 security forces have been aggressively battling @entity9 since the overthrow of president @entity41 in 2013			1
numerous checkpoints dot northern @entity8 to prevent the movement of weapons and fighters			0

after october 's attack , the government authorized a three - month curfew for the northern part of the peninsula			0
