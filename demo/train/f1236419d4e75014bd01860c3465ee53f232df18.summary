-- after receiving nearly 100 reports of stuck gas pedals in @entity5 and @entity6 vehicles , federal regulators said tuesday they have launched an investigation into the problem , which is a suspected cause of one death and nine injuries			1
the stuck accelerators are being investigated for their possible role in one fatal accident , 13 nonfatal crashes or fires and eight injury accidents , according to the @entity17			1
@entity5 and @entity6 said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected , according to the automakers ' reports to the @entity17 in 2004			1
more than half the vehicles were 2001 - 2004 model year @entity22			0
the remaining vehicles were 2001 - 2004 @entity25			0
the @entity17 now has identified 730,000 vehicles potentially affected , expanding the scope of vehicles in question			2
all 730,000 are 2001 - 2004 @entity31 and @entity30 with @entity33 engines , according to the @entity17			2
@entity6 and @entity5 issued recalls in 2004 on models of the sport utility vehicles that had 3.0 liter six cylinder engines			1
several of the reports to the @entity17 involve vehicles not covered by previous recalls , the agency said in a letter to @entity5 's @entity43 on thursday			1
one complaint is based on a fatal crash that occurred in january 2012 , the @entity17 said			2
some of the complaints allege that failures may have been related to repairs made in response to safety recalls initiated in 2004 , the investigation summary said			2
the 2004 @entity5 and @entity6 recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles			1
letters were also sent to dealers and customers , according to filings on the @entity17 website			0
" on your vehicle , it is possible that the accelerator cable may prevent the throttle from returning to the idle position , possibly resulting in elevated engine speeds while driving , " @entity5 's letter to customers read			0
" an unexpected increase in engine idle speed may increase stopping distance and may result in a vehicle crash without warning			0
" the @entity74 petitioned the @entity17 to open a similar investigation on july 8			0
the petition was denied thursday because part of the request is being covered by the agency 's newly opened investigation			0
the @entity17 has opened the investigation to assess " the scope , frequency and safety - related consequences of the alleged defect , " the agency said			0
neither @entity5 nor @entity6 responded to @entity0 's requests for comment .			1
