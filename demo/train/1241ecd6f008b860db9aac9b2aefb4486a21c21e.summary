-- former president @entity1 predicted that @entity3 ' obstructionist ways should change and president @entity5 's re-election prospects could improve after next week 's midterm elections			1
speaking wednesday on @entity8 's " the @entity7 , " @entity1 said the @entity3 has been " completely irresponsible " in the past 18 months by opposing most legislative initiatives backed by @entity5 and his fellow @entity10			1
but the nation 's 39th president said that approach might not work as well , if @entity3 go from the minority to the majority in either the @entity16 or @entity17			2
he said it could also end up leading to less of a logjam on @entity20			0
" if they , maybe , gain control , ... they 'll have to show some responsibility , so that @entity5 will will have an opponent with whom he can debate with some degree of rationality , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 praised @entity5 for doing " an extraordinary job " despite numerous challenges , including an environment in which most every move he made , even if it had once been championed by @entity3 , faced immediate opposition			2
if and when republicans engage the @entity35 after voters hit the polls on november 2 , @entity5 may be more able to engage them as well as voters in drawing a clear distinction between himself and his opponents , @entity1 said			1
" they 've been able to snipe away at what he does , and ( @entity5 ) has n't had a target to debate , " he said			0
" but that 's going to change over the next two years			0
so i think he 'll have a better chance to be re-elected than i think he ( may seem to have ) now			0
" a devout @entity49 and longtime sunday school teacher , @entity1 also addressed recent comments from @entity3 senatorial candidates @entity52 of @entity53 and @entity54 of @entity55 talking openly about religion on the campaign trail			0
he said that it 's very different from when he was president in the 1970s , because " there 's sort of a marriage between religious groups and one political party " -- the @entity3			0
@entity1 said the growing role of money in politics had poisoned the process , not only in funding relentless rounds of negative advertising , but also when the candidates set up shop in @entity71			1
" that 's been the main cause of the change in the political environment -- the enormous influence of vast amounts of money , ( sometimes ) secretly without identifying donors			1
a lot of that money is used in negative advertising to destroy the reputations of opponents , " said @entity1			2
" that animosity , that hatred , carries over			0
