-- @entity1 is no @entity2 and @entity1 prime minister @entity3 no @entity4			1
this is not a " @entity6 , " but a message to an elected leader to reign in his hubris and his divisive politics			0
these are some of the central messages , which both @entity1 commentators ( ourselves included ) , and the international media have brought across			0
@entity3 still has a choice , as the @entity17 reminds us , between rising to the highs of statesmanship of former @entity22 president @entity21 or spending his remaining political life as a @entity1 likeness of @entity26 president @entity25			2
the question now being asked in @entity1 's capital @entity29 , on @entity31 's @entity30 and in the occupied @entity32 , where the initial protests started , is whether @entity3 has the political determination and the nerve to accept the demands of the initial protestors			1
watch more : ' lady in red ' does not want to be a symbol that would mean giving up on his personal dream to build the @entity45 barracks on the park and turn it into a shopping mall			0
his track record would suggest otherwise			0
probably the single most important trigger for the rapid spread of events was the prime minister 's inability to listen to critique and disagreement , and the way in which this inability has manifested over the last few years			1
his rhetoric has been spiraling out of control and has ranged from lecturing women on how many children to bear to calling everyone who enjoys drinking a beer in a sidewalk cafe an alcoholic			0
read more : @entity3 defends handling of protests further , the country has used an excessively violent policing strategy , with which the government has oppressed almost all legitimate protest by trade unions , political movements and student groups			2
all this extreme use of force looks awkward in a country where the government was re-elected with almost 50 % of the vote only two years ago and where its macro-economic development indicators tell a story of unfettered progress			0
one might wonder why a government that still enjoys such popular support is unable to tolerate a few protests here and there and is incapable of giving into what are often very reasonable demands against the excesses of environmental degradation and rent - based urban renewal policies			1
why would an elected prime minister , who has , until now , been respected abroad and at home , use the force of his security apparatus to crush so brutally any popular dissent , which is far from threatening his place at the top of @entity1 's political system ? watch more : the week that changed @entity1 part of the answer lies in @entity1 's recent record of undemocratic manipulations to bring the government down			1
@entity113 elites , the military , the judiciary and the so - called " deep state " rogue elements acting within the visible state structures , conspired to terminate the @entity119 's ( @entity119 ) government from the very moment of its first election in 2002			0
ever since , the party had to face several attempts at power grab , from an ultra-nationalist conspiracy in the mid- 2000s based on unresolved assassinations of christian missionaries and the murder of @entity1 - @entity130 journalist @entity129 to the so - called @entity132 marches against the election as president of @entity135 to the @entity137 's only narrowly averted closure case against the ruling party in 2008			2
all of these experiences have led @entity3 and many members of the @entity119 government to look at @entity1 politics through the prism of conspiracies , and the blame for this shift does not lie only with the @entity119			1
more significantly though , the manipulations they faced from the judiciary and the military have led the @entity119 government to fill both institutions with sympathizers , thereby removing the already weak system of checks and balances in @entity1			2
read more : @entity3 : leader or ' dictator ' ? the confluence of both the conspiratorial mind - set and a lack of checks and balances has created the ground for @entity3 's unhealthy mix of extreme self - confidence on the one side and his insecurity vis - @entity170 - vis criticism on the other			1
the shopping mall in @entity32 , the third bridge over the @entity174 , the new airport and a canal project that is supposed to connect the @entity177 and the @entity178 have been devised without any consultation and public debate			0
that the prime minister sees any criticism of these projects as manipulations by domestic and external enemies is a sign of his insecurity			1
that he failed to grasp that the @entity30 protests were not started by undercover military agents , die - hard @entity189 , @entity190 agents or @entity192 provocateurs may yet mark the beginning of his undoing			0
will @entity3 be able to arrive at a sober consideration of the situation and give in to the demands of the protestors in @entity32 , call an impartial review of police brutality and reconsider the heavy policing strategies , which have turned @entity1 into a police state ? watch more : @entity1 as a ' pivotal ' country if he did , he would still have a chance to enter @entity1 history as a statesman who carried his country into the 21st century , disassembled the military 's tutelage , ended the @entity212 and granted long - fought - for rights to the country 's largest minority , the @entity216			1
if he fails , and drags the country towards polarization and political unrest , his government , the economy and hence the people of @entity1 will lose			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 and @entity226			0

@entity1 is no @entity2 and @entity3 no @entity4 , @entity225 and @entity228 write
but the trigger for the rapid spread of events was the prime minister 's inability to listen to critique and disagreement
one might wonder why a government that enjoys popular support is unable to tolerate a few protests
that the prime minister sees criticism of projects is a sign of insecurity and could yet prove his undoing
