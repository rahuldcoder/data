@entity0 -- co-founder and executive director of @entity5 , @entity2 opened the second @entity7 debate on @entity8 by outlining just what the term means to him , but also what it means to the communities his design solutions are aimed at			1
' when your focus is social change ... why would n't you want to share that openly ? ' taking the ego out of architecture , @entity2 sees the sharing of transformative design ideas as being a moral responsibility of today 's designers and architects			1
" when your focus is social change and not financial change why would n't you want to share that openly ? " below are some of @entity2 's thoughts on a number of topics that were discussed at the debate			1
on shared design " i always think of the design world like the medical world ; we have people who are plastic surgeons , but we have a lot of people who are in the emergency room and a lot of our designers are in the emergency room dealing with the critical issues like post-disaster issues or systemic issues or poverty			1
when i was in college the idea of being a socially responsible architect was unheard of , it was almost taboo : ' we 're trying to make jewels in the city ' , whereas a lot of us wanted to create cities that were jewels			1
" " when your focus is social change and not financial change why would n't you want to share that openly ? innovation only succeeds when it 's shared			1
if you 're a pioneer and you come up with something that can change the world and you turn round and say ' i 'm not going to share this idea with anyone ' then you only impact the few and not the many			1
" " but we 're in a situation right now where we have to deal with a huge variety of issues			1
if you have a design idea that can improve the lives of a million people it 's almost ethically irresponsible to keep to it yourself			2
" on sustainability " it angers me when sustainability gets used as a buzz word			2
for 90 percent of the world , sustainability is a matter of survival			2
when you as a designer design something that burdens a community with maintenance and old world technology , basically failed developed world technology then you will crush that community way beyond bad design ; you 'll destroy the economics of that community and often the community socially is broken			2
" " you have to do this marriage between what is appropriate , learning from the local nature , but also can we leapfrog technologies , so we 're not burdening people with outdated technologies			0
if we can come up with that , then it truly is sustainable			0
" on community involvement in design " the community is not your client but your partner			0
you do n't just put up some nice big rendering and tell them this is what you might have and do a q&a			0
doing workshops within the community and having them design these quiet moments of innovation within the larger developments , not only allows an empowerment of that community , but also ownership			0
" " just because you put their name on the building does n't mean they feel like they own it ; but empower them in the process not only does it quicken the process , but you find you have the political will you can put through things you never even imagined			0
" " when you have strong common will , then projects go forward			0
there 's nothing worse than selling or convincing , but if you 're inspiring and including then it 's a beautiful thing , and at the end of it you 're part of the community			0
