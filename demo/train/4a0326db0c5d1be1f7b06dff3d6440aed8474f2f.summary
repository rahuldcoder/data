@entity0 -- the @entity2 on saturday warned residents of tall structures in the path of @entity6 that the wind hitting upper floors will be stronger than those in most storms			1
" as @entity6 moves through areas with high - rise structures , these structures will experience winds significantly stronger than indicated by the advisory intensity , " forecasters said			1
" winds at the 30 - story level will likely be 20 % higher than at the surface			1
and winds 80 - 100 stories up could be about 30 % higher than the surface			1
" @entity6 was expected to reach the @entity0 metropolitan area sunday at hurricane strength			1
winds were at 80 mph saturday evening			2
the center 's analysis buttressed mayor @entity28 's call for high - rise residents to stay away from windows if they live on the 10th floor or above			1
at the city 's request , building owners were shutting down elevators saturday			0
reaching trapped residents would be a drain on police and fire who need to respond to " real emergencies , " @entity28 added			2
in a hurricane the higher you go , the stronger the wind gusts			1
@entity1 meteorologist @entity45 said the higher friction at the ground surface slows wind speeds			2
according to the @entity2 , forecasters started seeing the significant upper wind increase when the eye - wall collapsed over the @entity52			2
they also noted that there was little thunderstorm activity associated with @entity6			1
thunderstorms tend to bring the higher winds down to the surface , and with the lack of such activity the stronger winds are staying at higher levels			1
as the storm re-emerges over the @entity64 late saturday and moves northward , the colder waters also will aid in intensifying this effect			0
construction workers had wind dynamics in mind while they secured @entity69 ahead of @entity6 's arrival			1
while the windows being installed on the soon - to - be tallest building in the @entity73 are designed to withstand 125 mph winds , they 're only in place up to the 52nd floor			1
steel beams taking the place of the @entity80 have risen to the 80th floor			0
the remaining upper floors are open to the elements			0
that 's a serious concern because anything blown off a building from that height , even something as small as a bolt , can become a deadly projectile in a hurricane			0
" they are very big on safety here , " said @entity92 , an electrician working on @entity69			0
" if anything is not tied down they will address it and fix it			0
" the construction cranes high atop the @entity98 also were to be secured			0
they are designed to withstand strong winds			0
construction workers on the site are well aware how serious high winds are at a skyscraper under construction			1
while the @entity107 was being built a few years ago at @entity108 in @entity0 a plywood board was blown off the building			2
it struck a man below , killing him			0
@entity28 also urged people not to have a generator inside their home or apartment because " carbon monoxide fumes kill			0
" " homeowners and residents : if you have n't done so already , please bring outdoor furniture inside -- plywood , trash cans , any loose items that can blow around , " he said			2
@entity1 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
