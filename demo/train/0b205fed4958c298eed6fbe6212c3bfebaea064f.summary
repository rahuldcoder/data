-- as any ex-jock can tell you , any time you try exercising a muscle that has gone unused for a decade or more , something predictable happens : it barks like hell			0
this is what we 're seeing in this last pathetic run - up to the forced spending cuts agreed to by @entity13 and the president in july 2011 as a fail - safe in case the federal government could n't agree on a totally necessary but politically difficult settlement to address the country 's long - term fiscal unsustainability			1
" hundreds of thousands of @entity22 will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings , " president @entity21 warned			1
( @entity29 verdict : half true			0
" there is no indication that @entity22 will lose their insurance coverage or access to all primary care because of the sequester , " said @entity29 , but added " pretty close to ' hundreds of thousands ' " could lose flu vaccinations and cancer screenings			0
) a trio of @entity37 senators ( @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 ) jointly bemoaned " the calamitous effects that budget sequestration would have on our nation 's economy and security			2
" politicians have been trying to outdo each other in deploying what the neoliberal @entity50 founder @entity49 coined in 1976 as the " firemen first " principle -- the notion that " the public will support ( the @entity57 's ) valiant fight against the budget reduction only if essential services are endangered			1
thus , @entity57 always picks on teachers , policemen , firemen first			0
" so an already rattled nation is being spooked by horror stories of three - hour airport security lines , delayed background check for gun purchases and criminals running freely through the streets			0
all this for a spending cut that the @entity73 estimates will be around $ 44 billion in 2013 , a tiny sliver of the federal budget			1
imagine the squeals if it included significant cuts			0
@entity79 : @entity37 will get blame for cuts no doubt there will be those who find such fear - mongering persuasive			0
but for the rest of us , it suggests a rather pressing and relevant question : just what , precisely , did we get from doubling the cost of the federal government between 2000 and 2010 ? if the bureaucrats ca n't produce an explanation for the price increase of government , then they should not expect their budgets to be rubber - stamped by an already suffering public			1
so the squawking you hear is from a government money - machine having difficulty adapting to a political universe that no longer accepts automatic annual increases			2
and we 'll keep hearing it until the moment politicians have the courage to align government expenditures within miles of revenue			2
the @entity109 - winning economist @entity108 , who died in january , warned us three decades ago about the " permanent disconnect " between revenue and spending , brought about by politicians scared of charging taxpayers full freight for government goodies			1
opinion : the fairy tale on spending cuts " the attractiveness of financing spending by debt issue to the elected politicians should be obvious , " he wrote			1
" borrowing allows spending to be made that will yield immediate political payoffs without the incurring of any immediate political cost			0
" we are living with the results : national debt greater than 100 % of annual gross domestic product and no end in sight , just as the baby boomers stop working and start sucking down expensive federal entitlements			1
even if borrowing costs remain at their historic lows in perpetuity , this kind of debt overhang is more dangerous than any mild bureaucratic shuffle necessitated by the 1 % trim			2
why ? in their controversial april 2012 @entity150 working paper , economists @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 concluded that when countries carry debt of more than 90 % of gdp for five or more consecutive years , economic growth gets chopped down by more than a whole percentage point each year for decades			2
what 's the best method for reversing a debt crisis ? in a 2009 paper ( @entity164 ) , @entity160 economists @entity161 and @entity162 examined more than 100 debt - reduction efforts worldwide since 1970 , and asserted that " spending cuts are much more effective than tax increases in stabilizing the debt and avoiding economic downturns			1
" the authors found " several episodes in which spending cuts adopted to reduce deficits have been associated with economic expansions rather than recessions			1
" opinion : cuts will turn off voters @entity37 is courting taxpayers should n't be fearing the forced spending cuts , they should be fearing that the cuts do n't go nearly far enough			1
and politicians should realize that short - term debt service and long - term entitlements are going to keep shrinking the money left over for doling out goodies			0
like other things that ca n't go on forever , fiscal irresponsibility wo n't			0
time to get those muscles in shape			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity192 : politicians have been squawking about dire *fallout* of forced spending cuts
he says @entity13 and @entity21 agreed on them in 2011 deal , and they 're necessary
he asks : what have we gotten from huge increase in federal government 's budget ?
@entity192 : debt at 100 % of @entity208 , with boomers getting ready to queue up for benefits
