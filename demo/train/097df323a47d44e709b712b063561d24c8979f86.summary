@entity0 -- " @entity6 " is the first single off @entity3 's new solo album , and it 's an ode to his guitar			1
that 's not surprising for the @entity9 axeman , who was once no. 26 on @entity12 's list of the " @entity13 of all @entity14			1
" " i got this new steel string , " he explains , holding up his black acoustic with a bit of pride			2
" @entity20 of @entity21 referred to his main guitar as a ' heart attack machine , ' and it 's black , so i called it ' @entity6			1
' " when asked if he might one day write a real love song , as opposed to one for his guitar , @entity3 rolls his eyes			1
" why do people keep asking me that ? " he says before launching into an overtly sexual jam , worthy of a ' 70s porno flick			0
" try making babies to that ! " in the next room , @entity33 chuckles			0
" that guy 's made plenty of baby - making songs , " @entity3 says			1
he knows it 's true			1
the two musicians have an easy friendship			0
for years , they 've supported each other 's charitable endeavors and activist causes -- which inadvertently led to their first duet , the gospel - tinged " save the @entity45			1
" it 's a track on " @entity48 , " @entity3 's fourth record under the guise of his @entity51 alter ego			1
" we were playing a show in @entity55 for some union issue , and some of the other musicians on the bill were grousing about not getting paid , " @entity3 says			1
" one of the other musicians canceled the show because he had to return to his vineyard			0
we were on the phone kind of moaning about this , and @entity33 said , ' @entity3 , you let me know if you want me to put the hammer down			1
' and i said , ' @entity33 , save the hammer for the man			0
' and we 're like , ' hold on			0
one day , that must be a song ! ' " @entity3 says he and @entity33 have a lot in common , " from the ethnicity of our parents to quite a number of things			1
" both hail from white moms and black dads			0
" we like to consider ourselves the biracial , punk rock @entity81 , " @entity3 says			1
in the home studio where the pair recorded " save the @entity45 , " the 47 - year - old singer - songwriter spoke with @entity1 about " @entity48 " and how events in his childhood shaped his political activism			0
@entity1 : " @entity48 " has a broader focus than your previous albums			1
the @entity51 has gone global			2
@entity3 : i was not looking into a crystal ball when writing the songs for " @entity48			1
" i wrote the songs about a year and a half ago , and yet worldwide events have caught up with them -- from the maquiladoras of @entity99 ( plants that export manufactured goods ) , to the unrest in @entity103 and @entity104			0
it 's a record with a global focus , and it 's part folk record and part rock record			1
@entity1 : you pick up the electric guitar , which you really have n't done as @entity51			0
@entity3 : this is the first @entity51 record where i really play a lot of electric guitar			1
about three years ago , i played an electric version of @entity116 's " @entity115 " with @entity116 on stage , and it was the first time i 'd ever sung with an electric guitar in my hands			2
i realized i could do what i do best as an electric guitar player without sacrificing the integrity of the political , folk music singer - songwriterism that i enjoy very much			0
@entity1 : are you getting more comfortable as a singer these days ? @entity3 : it 's a matter of playing hundreds and hundreds of gigs , and recording four records of my material			1
some of my favorite singers have been @entity133 or @entity134 -- people who may not be able to hit a high " c " on the piano , but whose voices contain the gravitas that makes the music feel like they mean it			0
@entity1 : this is a really autobiographical album , is n't it ? @entity3 : while the events it speaks of are on a global level , it 's also the most personal @entity51 record , as well			1
i deal in some parts of the record with my @entity152 heritage			2
music , i think , is best when it honestly explores personal demons , and it stirs around in the silt of the psyche to find out what 's really there			2
and if it 's true and it rhymes , i 'll put it on the record			1
@entity1 : there 's a song on this record , " @entity164 , " that seems quite personal , given your family 's history in @entity170			1
@entity3 : my parents met in @entity170			1
my father is @entity173 , is @entity152			0
the @entity152 side of my family was involved in the anticolonial movement			0
my great uncle was @entity178 , @entity170 's first president , who led the movement to oust the @entity180 from @entity170			2
i did n't grow up with my @entity152 family			0
i grew up in a small , conservative suburb of @entity55			2
the song " facing @entity170 " explores the pride in that country and the distance from it as well			0
@entity1 : what was it like growing up biracial in a small @entity189 town ? @entity3 : i literally integrated the small town of @entity191 , @entity189			1
i was the first person of color to reside within its borders , which was confirmed when the real estate agent had to go door - to - door in the apartment building we wanted to rent , asking if it was ok for this interracial family -- my mom is white and i was a 1 - year - old half - @entity173 kid -- to live in the apartment building			0
the sales pitch was , " well , look , he 's not an @entity205			2
he 's a very exotic @entity173 , " and that was something that the neighbors were like , " oh , that 's very interesting ! " -- until i got old enough to date their daughters			2
@entity1 : were there any incidents of racism you can talk about ? @entity3 : people often ask how i became political , or when i became political			1
when you 're the only black kid growing up in an all - white town , you find your politics on the first playground that you go onto			1
in some ways , it was an idyllic place to grow up -- but when i was 13 , there was a noose in my family 's garage			2
there was some name - calling throughout			0
you know , race is not an issue that is settled to this day			0
in the @entity233 suburbs , certainly in the 1970s , it was a hot button			0
@entity1 : you graduated from @entity235			0
then all of a sudden , you were a rock star			0
@entity3 : the first @entity51 album is called " @entity237			1
" it 's not a misnamed album			1
i was the only black kid in an all - white town			2
then i was the only radical student in a conservative high school			0
then i was the only @entity243 guitar player at @entity235			0
then i was the only dude with a @entity235 diploma in a @entity246 rock ' n ' roll band			0
so in some ways , there 's always been a sense of aloneness			2
but where i really felt the greatest connection -- outside of close - knit family -- is playing this @entity51 music , and in playing it live			0
this is a place where i feel not disconnected in any way , but very , very connected , and it 's a place that feels like home .			2

" it 's a record with a global focus , " @entity3 says of his new solo album
@entity3 was no. 26 on @entity12 's " @entity13 of @entity266 " list
he talks about the racism he faced growing up in a small @entity189 town
