-- " two professors , both alike in dignity , in fair @entity3 where we lay our scene			0
" when it is finally written , the story of one of the greatest scientific discoveries of our age may begin something like this			0
last month , two eminent professors -- @entity14 and @entity15 -- were jointly awarded one of science 's greatest honours : the @entity19			1
the award came on the back of the dramatic announcement last year that the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , based in @entity3 , had made an astonishing discovery : a new particle , a @entity26 , had been comprehensively proven to exist			1
physicists around the world rejoiced -- some wept openly			0
years of speculation , theory and research had suddenly been validated			2
in typical @entity36 understatement , @entity33 , permanent secretary of the @entity34 said " this year 's prize is about something small that makes all the difference			1
" the discovery came as a major puzzle piece in the way physicists understand the universe			0
the " @entity45 " of physics , which some regard as a " theory of almost everything " suffered from a significant " missing link " before the discovery of the @entity26			1
now there seemed to be a reason why particles have mass ; now we had a key to understanding our 4 % of the universe and perhaps access to understanding the other 96 % of the universe as well			0
but just as one set of answers were being revealed , more questions immediately presented themselves			0
@entity63 spoke to some of the world 's top physicists about what the discovery of the @entity26 means , and what questions now need to be addressed			1
@entity69 , a scientist at the prestigious @entity71 laboratory in @entity72 said : " the big question is why the @entity14 ( particle ) , with a mass more than 100 times that of the proton , is so light			0
that question is not answered by our picture of the universe " @entity82 , @entity83 at @entity84 , says that in his view : " there are issues like what is dark matter ? ( and ) why is the universe mostly matter not antimatter ? " @entity91 , a professor of physics at @entity93 , says : " the main question is this : we have never seen an elementary particle without spin			0
@entity97 , quarks , photon , etc all have spins ... the @entity26 may actually have spin but it is spinning in extra dimensions of space we can not see			2
we really need to know the true nature and context of this newly discovered particle			0
" to answer these questions the @entity23 will soon be joined by another massive experimental facility -- the @entity110 ( @entity110 )			1
like the @entity23 , the @entity110 will be a vast machine that stretches for miles beneath the earth			1
a site for the @entity110 has yet to be determined			2
the history of science is replete with machines that have helped scientists make significant breakthroughs , providing the kind of quantifiable , testable , reproducible data science requires to progress			0
from @entity123 's ionization chamber used in the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity , to @entity126 ray tubes which led to the discovery of the electron , to @entity131 counters and more recently the @entity23 , discoveries have come from equipment both big and small ; simple and complex			2
the @entity110 sits as the latest in a long line of machines designed to advance physics , but what exactly will it do that the @entity23 can not ? @entity138 , @entity139 at @entity140 , @entity142 's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics , says that it will be able to produce many more @entity14 particles than the vast collider in @entity3 , and will offer new levels of accuracy			1
" the @entity110 will be able to study the @entity14 precisely , " he said			2
" it will be a @entity14 factory and will be able to make measurements of the @entity14 ' properties with 3 % relative precision as opposed to the @entity23 's 25 % relative precision , people believe ... the @entity110 could ' crack open the @entity14 ' and reveal the mysteries of nature 's first spin - zero particle			1
" @entity159 , the @entity160 for the @entity110 , says that it is not impossible that the vast machine could help us discover an overarching theory of everything			1
" if we are lucky , the @entity110 can detect a whole new family of particles that might help us to realize @entity168 's dream of uniting all the theories of physics into one overarching and conceptually simple theory , " @entity159 says			1
a decision to begin construction on the @entity110 is currently expected by 2015			0
@entity175 contributed to this article			0

the @entity110 aims to " discover an overarching theory of everything "
the vast new facility will *increase* understanding of the @entity26 , *commonly* known as the " @entity183 particle "
research into the particle led to the awarding of this year 's @entity19
