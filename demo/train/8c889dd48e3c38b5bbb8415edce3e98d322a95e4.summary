-- sixty - six people have died from west nile virus infections this year , and the number of human cases has grown to 1,590 , the @entity2 @entity1 said wednesday			1
that 's the highest case count through the last week of august since the virus was first detected in the @entity2 in 1999			1
nearly half of all the infections have occurred in @entity11 , where officials said later wednesday that 894 cases have been reported along with 34 deaths			1
" those numbers are going to go up , " said dr. @entity15 , commissioner for the @entity16			0
@entity15 said it looks like 2012 will be the worst year so far when it comes to west nile virus cases			1
in 2003 , @entity11 reported 40 deaths because of the virus , and health officials believe they will surpass that number this year			1
all lower 48 states are now reporting @entity27 activity , and 43 states have reported at least one person infected with the virus			1
fast facts on @entity27 virus more than 70 % of all west nile virus cases in the @entity2 are found in six states : @entity11 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , according to the @entity1			1
while the @entity1 said these are the highest number of cases reported by the last week in august since the disease was first recorded in 1999 , it 's not the highest number the country has seen			1
in 2003 , the @entity2 had 9,862 reported cases of @entity27 virus , and in 2002 there were more than 4,100 cases and 284 fatalities			1
in more than half the current nationwide cases , @entity27 has led to neuroinvasive disease -- serious illnesses like meningitis , encephalitis or virus - associated paralysis			2
about 10 % of these cases can be fatal , according to the @entity1 , and a high proportion of those who survive can be left with longstanding neurological problems			2
older people are more vulnerable to severe illness from @entity27			0
so far , the median age among those with neuroinvasive disease this year is 58			0
in @entity11 , nearly two - thirds of all cases are in people older than 50			1
health officials do not yet know why there are more cases this year than in recent years			2
based on previous experiences with floods and hurricanes , health officials do not believe @entity73 will have a major impact on this year 's outbreak			2
mosquitoes that spread the virus breed in small nutrient - rich pools of water , such as the water found in old tires , so a large rainfall event or flooding usually washes out those small pools and eliminates breeding sites , said dr. @entity87 , who heads the @entity1 's @entity88			2
but after the water recedes , there 's always the possibility that new small pools of water will form			0
@entity87 urged the public to take proper precautions to prevent getting sick regardless of whether they live in a state with high or low case counts			0
to reduce your risk of exposure to mosquitoes and to prevent their breeding sites : -- drain all standing water from flower pots , old tires , clogged rain gutters , etc. , where mosquitoes breed			0
-- use an insect repellant that contains @entity110 , picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus			0
-- also wear long sleeves and long pants to protect your skin when you 're outside			0
-- stay indoors at dusk and dawn because that 's when mosquitoes are most active			0
@entity27 outbreak largest ever in @entity2			0
