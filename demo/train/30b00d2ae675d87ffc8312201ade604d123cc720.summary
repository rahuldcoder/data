-- the @entity1 filed a lawsuit tuesday that seeks to stop the state of @entity4 from purging voters from registration rolls			1
attorney general @entity7 said the @entity4 program clearly violated voter registration laws			1
" we have done all that we can to try and reason with the people in @entity4 , " @entity7 told a @entity11 committee at a hearing tuesday in explaining why the lawsuit would be filed			1
@entity4 's @entity18 governor , @entity17 , argued earlier tuesday that removing non- @entity20 citizens from lists of registered voters was a legal necessity			1
appearing on @entity0 's " @entity24 , " @entity17 said the state had identified " almost 100 individuals " who had registered to vote but were n't @entity20 citizens			1
" over 50 of them have voted in our elections , " @entity17 said			2
" i have an obligation to enforce the laws of our land			0
you do n't get to vote in @entity4 if you 're a non- @entity20 citizen			2
" the lawsuit comes after the department began questioning the legality of the state 's so - called voter purge program , which would remove names from @entity4 's voter rolls months before the 2012 presidential election			1
@entity4 is considered a key battleground state in the race between president @entity44 and certain @entity18 challenger @entity45			2
using information from @entity4 's @entity47 , the state identified more than 100,000 names of non-eligible voters that could potentially be on the lists illegally			1
the @entity1 contends the @entity4 program improperly uses the information collected from old driver 's license applications , saying the data could be outdated			1
" a number of persons will subsequently have become citizens and lawfully registered to vote , " the department said in a letter monday			0
critics say the plan unfairly targets minorities and paint it as an attempt to dissuade typically @entity69 voters from going to the polls			0
@entity17 said tuesday that claim was bogus			0
" this is not a partisan issue , " he said on @entity0			0
" this is not @entity18 or @entity74 or independent issue			0
this is an issue that i want , all of us want , everyone wants every @entity20 citizen to go and register to vote			0
but non- @entity20 citizens should n't be doing that			0
" @entity4 , which itself is suing the @entity85 for access to a citizenship database , was within its legal rights in moving ahead with the purge , @entity17 said			2
in 2008 , @entity44 won @entity4 with 51 % of the vote , and the state is classified as a " toss up " on @entity0 's @entity92 in 2012			2
there are 29 electoral votes at stake .			0

@entity4 gov. @entity17 says the goal is to *prevent* illegal aliens from voting
