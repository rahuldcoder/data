-- unless you 've been living under a rock , you know to apply sunscreen			2
there 's lifesaving reason to : about 3.5 million cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year			1
" the incidence of skin cancer , including melanoma -- the deadliest kind -- is going up , and wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to prevent it , " says dr. @entity9 , a dermatologist and spokesperson for the @entity11			1
stick with these smart tips -- and check out our product picks -- to make sure you 're as protected as you can possibly be			0
select a sunscreen you love finding your sunscreen soul - mate is the key motivating factor for using it regularly , experts agree			2
" if you think your sunscreen is pasty , thick or smelly , you have the wrong kind , " says dr. @entity27 , clinical associate professor of dermatology at @entity29			2
" it may make you less likely to put it on , or to reapply when you do			0
" happily , there are plenty of lightweight , sheer formulas , like @entity39 lotion @entity40 50 ( $ 29 ; vichyusa.com ) and @entity41 60 @entity43 sunscreen fluid for face @entity40 60 with @entity45 ( $ 30 ; laroche - posay.us )			1
@entity46 : which sunscreen is best for you ? remember , @entity40 30 is the new 15 as a general rule , @entity40 15 blocks 93 % of @entity50 rays , @entity40 30 blocks 97 % and @entity40 50 blocks 98 %			1
doctors now typically recommend at least @entity40 30 -- at least being the key words			1
if you have a family history of skin cancer or are vacationing in a tropical spot ( where the sun is especially intense ) , go for 50 or even 70			1
just keep in mind : no sunscreen provides 100 % protection			1
so to be safe as possible , you still need to reapply every two hours and after a swim , even if you used the water - resistant kind , says dr. @entity63 , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at @entity66 in @entity67			1
try @entity69 sunscreen spray broad - spectrum @entity40 30 ( $ 11 ; at mass retailers )			1
fyi , sunscreen becomes less effective about three years after you open the container			0
@entity46 : is it a mole ... or skin cancer ? check labels for the term broad - spectrum it means the sunscreen provides protection against both @entity82 ( wrinkle - and cancer - causing ) and @entity50 ( burning ) rays			1
problem is , that labeling rule only went into effect in december and stores still sell inventory made prior to it , notes dr. @entity90 , director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at @entity93 in @entity94 , @entity95			0
so if you 're shopping and there 's no broad - spectrum mention , check the ingredients for zinc or avobenzone , the only two that provide top - notch @entity82 coverage , he says			0
@entity106 broad - spectrum @entity104 ( $ 36 ; coolasuncare.com ) contains zinc , and @entity107 for face broad - spectrum @entity40 30 ( $ 10 ; at mass retailers ) has avobenzone			1
@entity46 : 7 ways you 're aging your skin layer it on think you apply enough ? almost no one does			1
" several big studies show that most people rub in only about a fourth of what 's needed to reach the labeled @entity40 -- it 's faster and easier to put on just a bit , " notes @entity27			2
instead of that old advice to use a shot glass - size dose , all our experts recommend applying two coats			0
squeeze a line of lotion down your arms and legs and rub in , then do it again			0
ditto for spray formulas : hold the nozzle close to your skin and spray , moving slowly up and down until you see a sheen , then go back over the area			0
for your face , apply a pea - size drop to each cheek , your forehead and your chin , then smear in			0
repeat ! @entity46 : sun - proof your skin from a to z do n't forget your nose it 's the number one sunburn - spot , dermatologists say			0
" people apply sunscreen to their face , but either skip or speed over their nose -- especially if they wear glasses , because they do n't want to take them off , " @entity90 says			0
@entity9 adds , " 80 % of the skin cancers i remove are on the nose			2
" other commonly missed areas include the feet , hair part , ears and chest , as well as the backs of hands and legs			0
use a sunscreen stick to spot - apply ; try @entity40 30 + ( $ 10 ; trustthebum.com ) or @entity169 - @entity168 broad - spectrum @entity170 50 + ( $ 5 ; at mass retailers )			1
get antioxidant insurance since rays can still get through sunscreen , companies are now including antioxidants such as vitamins c and @entity178 and green tea to help mitigate damage			2
if you do n't want to bother applying a serum that contains them beneath your moisturizer or sunscreen ( @entity90 's first choice ) , try a souped - up @entity40 pick , like @entity188 with @entity189 broad - spectrum @entity40 50 ( $ 19 ; supergoop.com )			1
@entity46 : are @entity190 ? realize that sunscreen is only one part of a sun - smart plan " the hierarchy of sun protection should be avoidance first , then seek shade and wear a wide - brim hat and protective clothing , then use sunscreen -- but most people have that sequence backward , " @entity90 points out			2
consider hitting the beach or pool in the morning instead of midday ( when sun is strongest ) , and bring an umbrella and a tightly woven long - sleeve shirt			0
know that it 's never too late to start safe habits so you baked in the sun as a teen with little or no sunscreen			0
while regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you 're young raises your risk of skin cancer , @entity9 says , what 's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days			1
" since skin 's ability to repair itself decreases with age , your risk is even greater if you burn now			0
" good thing you 're using it ! @entity227 2011			0
