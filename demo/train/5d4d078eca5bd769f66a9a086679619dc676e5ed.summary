@entity0 , @entity1 -- only at @entity5 , the annual gathering of self - proclaimed fanboys and fangirls , can an early screening of a movie feel like a rock concert , and then literally become one			1
in a surprise on thursday night , some audience members to the panel for " @entity12 " --- in which star @entity13 arrived in a @entity15 costume --- were given the chance to see the entire movie early at a nearby theater			1
the crowd cheered during the movie 's opening credits and roared their approval whenever the title character landed a decisive blow while facing off with his new girlfriend 's " evil exes			2
" the movie , based on a @entity30 manga - inspired comic book , has a good possibility of appealing to comic book fans and gamers alike			1
" it surpassed my expectations , and i 'm a huge fan , " said @entity34 , after the screening , which ended with a performance by the band @entity37 , while cast members such as @entity39 from " @entity40 " rocked out in the balcony			0
@entity44 of @entity45 , @entity1 , is one of several who said the movie was the highlight of the convention so far			2
" i thought the movie was amazing			2
i saw the panel after the one for ' @entity52			0
' @entity53 is hard to beat , but that was pretty awesome			0
" it 's just one of many ways @entity58 studios are trying to get the most bang for their promotional buck among these hardcore filmgoers			2
giving them a chance to see early footage is one thing , but some moviemakers are trying a more " immersive experience " to make sure that the fans have high praise for their top projects , especially when they post to their favorite social media site			1
" @entity76 " does n't stop there , with an off - site area center where attendees can get custom - made t - shirts			0
not to be outdone , " @entity80 's " car , the @entity78 , and the movie 's " booth babes , " known as the @entity79 are all over @entity5			1
con - goers can head up to another off - site location , @entity85 , to catch a glimpse of the masked hero 's vehicle of choice , and others owned by the @entity80			0
" we tried to take risks and make something interesting , and also make something that is worth this amount of money , " said the @entity91 himself , @entity93 , gesturing towards the cars			2
" we went through a lot of different designs [ for the @entity78 ] and ended up with basically the same design as the tv show			0
we just added bigger guns			0
" a comic - con veteran , @entity93 prefers @entity106 over @entity107 and , as for the convention itself , he says he " wishes it were a little bit more about the comics , actually			0
" if cars are n't your thing and you prefer your " immersive experiences " to be more on the techie side , " @entity118 : @entity127 " has an app for that : an all - new version of the " tanks " game from the @entity118 arcade can be downloaded onto @entity126			1
there 's also " @entity129 , " returning to @entity5 for the second year in a row			1
this year , there is a scavenger hunt of sorts on @entity134 , where attentive fans can gain access to special events inside the arcade , which reveal secrets of the film , among other things			1
as " immersive experiences " go , however , " @entity147 , " which had all of 24 hours before the movie 's release to make an impression , went the old - fashioned route by revealing a big surprise thursday : @entity151 favoring the audience with an appearance			1
@entity154 was also on hand to promote the upcoming comic book adaptation , " @entity157 , " though @entity159 winner @entity158 may have stolen the show by talking about her first action role			0
speaking of action , the aforementioned @entity53 was indeed there thursday , pushing " @entity52 , " along with just about every other action hero who is n't the governor of the most populous state in the union			0
another way to grab fans ' attention is food , and @entity176 's upcoming " @entity175 " had a taco stand set up on thursday night , along with an outdoor screening of new footage			0
there are still a few more high - profile movies hoping to thrill the @entity5 crowd			1
" @entity180 " starring @entity181 , and the next two @entity106 adaptations , " @entity183 " and " captain america : the @entity187 " still have their @entity186 presentations coming up over the weekend			0
visitors to the booths in the exhibitors hall had an early glimpse of @entity192 , an alien from " @entity180 , " and both @entity194 and @entity15 's shield were on display			0
also , " @entity198 " director @entity197 is hoping that his third time 's a charm at @entity5 with " @entity201 , " which is still in production			1
and believe it or not , " @entity204 and the @entity205 " will mark that successful movie franchise 's first appearance in @entity0			1
prior to the panel , fans are getting a look at the famous horcruxes as they will appear in the movie			2
at a convention where there is no such thing as too flashy , even the wildly - popular " @entity204 " might have to pull off every trick up his sleeve to avoid getting overshadowed .			2

fans *preview* entire movie " @entity12 , " at @entity5
movie studios are *employing* *dancing* girls , scavenger hunts , @entity126 apps and more
the " @entity204 " franchise will make first appearance at @entity5 this year
