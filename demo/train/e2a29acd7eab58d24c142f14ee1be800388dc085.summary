-- @entity1 , a player of unquestionable talent but with an unfortunate tendency to bite , now faces disciplinary action from soccer 's governing body after he appeared to sink his teeth into an opponent yet again			1
@entity9 said wednesday that it has begun proceedings after the @entity12 striker was accused of biting another player during his team 's @entity15 victory over @entity17 a day earlier			1
television pictures showed @entity1 dipping his head toward @entity17 defender @entity20 , sending both men tumbling to the ground			1
when the @entity24 defender eventually got up , he pulled down his shirt and furiously indicated he had been bitten on the shoulder			1
@entity1 , 27 , has already been banned twice in his career for his wayward teeth			1
but those offenses happened in club - level games			2
tuesday 's incident was during soccer 's biggest spectacle , in front of an audience of millions			2
and whether he 's ultimately found guilty , @entity1 's teeth baring now takes its place in the annals of @entity15 controversy , along with @entity46 's " @entity45 " goal and @entity44 's headbutt			1
@entity1 and the @entity47 have until 5 p.m. @entity53 time ( 4 p.m. et ) wednesday " to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant " to the disciplinary proceedings , @entity9 said			1
@entity1 , a mercurial player who has earned both accolades and ignominy in his career , could face a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years			1
it will probably be much less			0
former @entity24 international @entity60 was given an eight - match ban in 1994 , the longest suspension in @entity15 history , after breaking the nose of @entity66 's @entity65			1
and @entity44 , the former @entity67 midfielder , was handed a three - match ban for headbutting @entity69 in the 2006 final			0
after the game , which @entity12 won 1 - 0 , @entity1 said he simply collided with @entity20 's shoulder			1
" the only thing i know , " he said , " is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch			0
" ' @entity1 is a sneak ' to a large extent , @entity12 's fate at the @entity15 rests on @entity1			1
forced to undergo surgery , he missed @entity12 's opening game against @entity83			1
he made a dramatic return in time to face @entity86 just five weeks after his operation -- and scored both goals in the @entity91 side 's 2 - 1 win			2
then came tuesday 's faceoff with @entity17			1
the two teams were scoreless in the first half			0
then came the controversial tussle			0
moments later , @entity12 's @entity96 scored the match 's only goal			1
despite vigorous objection from the @entity24 players , the @entity100 referee refused to look at @entity20 's shoulder , or penalize @entity1			1
( in yet another bizarre coincidence , the @entity100 referee @entity104 is known as " @entity106 " for his apparent resemblance to the actor who plays the character in a tv show there )			0
" @entity1 is a sneak and he gets away with it because @entity9 want their stars to play in the @entity15 , " @entity20 told @entity111 afterward			1
" i 'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him			0
the referee saw the bite mark too , but he did nothing about it			0
" facing criticism again @entity9 vice-president @entity125 , who also presides as head of the organization 's referees committee , said he had serious concerns over @entity1 's actions			1
" i have watched the incident several times on television , " he said			0
" there is no doubt @entity1 is a fantastic footballer but , once again , his actions have left him open to severe criticism			1
" @entity12 coach @entity138 said he did n't spot the incident but would like to see images of it			1
" and if it happened , the referee probably did n't see it , " he said			0
" so no , i do n't have any more comments to make			0
we had more important things than this in a football match			0
" but he suggested that @entity1 was being singled out by the media			2
" there seems there is animosity against this football player , " @entity138 said			0
" he just came out of a difficult moment and he has been penalized			0
there are people hiding behind the tree waiting for something to happen			0
" defended by captain the @entity12 team captain , @entity160 , blamed @entity20 for exaggerating the episode			1
when asked by reporters about the incident , he said , " you saw this , really ? " you need to show me because i did n't see anything			0
" did you see it today or did you see what happened in other years			0
you could n't have seen it today because nothing happened			0
" the worst of everything is the attitude of @entity20			2
he 's a great player , with an enormous status			2
it does n't correspond with @entity24 football			0
as sportsmen leaving the field , crying and appealing against a rival			0
as a man he disappointed me totally			0
" previous bites the @entity185 , who plays his club football with @entity188 , was banned for 10 games in april 2013 after being found guilty of biting @entity191 defender @entity190			2
he was also guilty of biting during his time in the @entity193 with @entity194 where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of @entity198			2
@entity1 's rap sheet is lengthy			1
at the @entity200 in @entity201 , he deliberately handled the ball on the goal - line to deny @entity204 a place in the semifinals of the @entity15			2
he was sent off for his troubles but @entity204 missed the penalty and @entity12 went on to finish third in the tournament			2
the following year after his move to @entity188 , @entity1 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity212 's @entity211			1
he was fined $ 63,000 and banned for eight matches			0
dazzling season last week , after scoring both goals in the game against @entity86 , @entity1 hit out at the @entity218 media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions			1
" before the game people in @entity86 laughed about my attitude over the last few years , " he said			2
" i want to see what they think now			0
i have dreamed of this moment			0
" @entity1 enjoyed a sensational season with @entity188 -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the @entity229			2
he was voted @entity230 by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists ' @entity230 too -- awards that reflected a feeling that @entity1 had put his troubled past behind him			2
but all those controversies came rushing back to haunt him tuesday			0
his tangle with @entity20 appears to have put his participation in the rest of the @entity15 in serious doubt			1
in this case , he may have bitten off more than he can chew			0
how social media chewed up @entity1 reality bites , but @entity12 have their hero 's back smitten or bitten ? some adore @entity12 's @entity1 , others cry foul @entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			1
