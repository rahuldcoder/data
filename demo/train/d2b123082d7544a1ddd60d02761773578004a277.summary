-- can beauty be defined by age , gender , color , body shape or size ? who gets to decide ? multibillion - dollar beauty and fashion industries both shape and depend on the cult - like worship of what physical attributes the public sees as beautiful			1
and most women feel the effects of those decisions			0
the photo exhibition " @entity20 " at the @entity21 in @entity22 , with 175 pictures by iconic photographers , is aimed at starting people thinking and talking about female beauty			1
it also peeks into the underbelly of the beauty industry , including its relation to celebrity , plastic surgery , the faux - perfection of airbrushing of advertising and even child beauty pageants			1
there are a lot of hot - button issues as to how the media and the beauty and fashion worlds depict whole groups of people , why they show them in a particular way or barely notice them at all			1
however , there 's been a major shift when it comes to diversity in beauty advertising and magazine beauty editorial spreads			1
supermodel @entity55 , @entity56 's corporate diversity director @entity55 , fashion insider @entity55 , @entity58 's beauty editor @entity57 and others share their thoughts on the evolving and increasingly inclusive take on gorgeousness			1
@entity64 's changing definition of beautiful several studies suggest that many equate beauty with symmetry , but even within that equation , " each time has its own standard ( of beauty ) , " said photographer @entity70 during his lecture at the @entity72			1
view more than 30 former @entity77 queens a photographer , an editor or a casting director may be subject to his or her personal predilections of what beauty is and foist them upon the public , leading entire societal likes and dislikes to shift , too			1
and that standard in @entity64 is changing rapidly			1
today , the number of marriages between people of different ethnicities is surging			0
back in 1993 , @entity97 's cover story " @entity94 of @entity64 , " featuring a computer generated face consisting of a mix of several ethnicities , is indeed more in line with what most of us now consider beautiful , according to @entity102 's @entity101			1
" sixty - four percent of all our respondents think women of mixed race represent the epitome of beauty , " the survey says			1
and of those respondents who said they wished to change their skin color , " 70 % reported that they wanted it to be darker			0
" full lips and curvy bodies are also coveted			0
that 's a far cry from 1991 when most @entity102 respondents chose blonde haired , blue - eyed @entity118 as the ideal beauty			1
the all - american look today is much more of a hybrid			0
one model 's story model , writer and television personality @entity55 ( former co-host of " @entity128 " on @entity129 ) experienced this transition from the front lines of the beauty industry			1
although @entity134 was the first african - american on the cover of @entity137 in 1974 , @entity133 was the first @entity135 to win a major cosmetics campaign when she signed on with @entity139 in 1992			0
" for me personally it was like almost the impossible dream of the fashion industry , " says @entity133 of her @entity139 campaign			0
" the biggest reward , the most money you could make , the highest level of commercial validation			0
and you know a barrier -- a real barrier , a glass ceiling that existed forever -- got broken			0
" and the ideal of beauty , and who represents beauty , and what beautiful is changed so quickly and so radically right after that , that by the time i had my children they ca n't even recognize the world of fashion and beauty that i came up in			2
" @entity133 says that in any business when you qualify and can perform on every level , " but you 're rejected out of hand because of your skin color ... not even your skin color , but the perception of your ' race , ' there 's nothing more frustrating than that , " says @entity133			0
but today there 's a whole spectrum of women who 've helmed beauty campaigns from blonde to brunette , from fair skinned to deep , including celebrities such as @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 and models such as @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			2
a global perspective = good business @entity197 has shown the beauty industry that embracing a world of beauty is n't just good karma , it 's also good for the bottom line			1
" for us , the more you are diverse , the more you are successful , " says @entity203			0
@entity56 is the world 's largest beauty company and includes 23 international brands , including @entity56 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210			2
if you are to be a leader , @entity211 says that you have to understand " there is a link between beauty and diversity			2
" and that includes understanding the vision of beauty in places such as @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 as well the @entity64			1
" if it 's only one vision of beauty and not a diverse one , you are out			2
... we have to reflect everyone from the model to the employee			0
" @entity57 , @entity58 's beauty editor who also once worked at @entity232 , says that she 's been lucky to work at magazines that are all about a global perspective , diversity and unusual beauty			1
diversity , of course , can be expresses a myriad of ways , be it featuring women with freckles , who are curvier or who are 45 and older			0
an element in the beauty world that changed things , " was the @entity247 campaign , " says @entity57			2
" using many different types of models and reflecting what women really look like			0
" the campaign 's stated goal is to " free ourselves and the next generation from beauty stereotypes " and contribute to building self - esteem for young women and others through marketing campaigns featuring women of different shapes , sizes , ages and hues as well as partnering with groups such as the @entity269 and the @entity270			2
@entity55 has been a model , modeling agent and recently @entity137 editor - at - large			0
" i 'm an advocate of the fashion model , " says @entity55 , who laments models losing jobs to actors and singers			0
but she does see big changes in advertising in that it better reflects @entity64 demographics			1
@entity55 points out that the beauty industry has a large consumer base , speaks to a broader group of people , and so is more democratic and shifts faster than the fashion world			2
but as the global economy shifts , so too will fashion with the help of newspaper editors who call out inequities and magazine editors , casting directors , advertising agencies and designers committed to inclusiveness , as well as the public			2
" the word beauty is such a controversial word , " says @entity55			0
" i think that the more that there 's exposure ( of different kinds of looks ) , and as long as you expose them consistently , you give people a chance to see what could also be beautiful besides what came before			0
" the " @entity20 " exhibition opened may 21 and runs through november 27 .			1

the @entity20 exhibit opened in may at the @entity314
the exhibit looks at cultural ideals as well as @entity64 standards of beauty
looking at the global perspective for beauty is *enlightening* for everyone
