the chances you will get sicker or even die just because you went to the hospital have gone down dramatically			2
this has been a huge problem			0
for many years hospital mistakes and hospital acquired infections have been one of the biggest killers of @entity9			1
yet a new report shows that patient safety efforts at @entity9 hospitals seem to be paying off			2
an estimated 50,000 more patients are alive today that would n't be if hospitals kept making the same number of mistakes they did in 2010 , according to this new report from the @entity19 ( @entity20 )			1
it released the new numbers tuesday and called the improvement -- particularly the improvements in 2013 -- " remarkable			2
" " hospital - acquired conditions , " as they are called in the industry , include falls , pressure ulcers , infections at surgical sites , pneumonia caused by a patient 's ventilator , catheter problems , and problems with a patient 's drugs			0
preliminary estimates show that in total , hospital patients experienced 1.3 million fewer instances of harm from 2010 to 2013			1
this translates to a 17 % decrease over the three - year period			0
this is good news since a 2010 report from @entity20 's @entity48 had found that 27 % of @entity50 patients had come to some kind of harm because of the care they received at the hospital			1
and these were n't simple incidents			0
half of those patients experienced a significant problem that ended in serious or permanent injury or even death			0
hospital - acquired infections and mistakes have cost the industry and taxpayers billions			1
and at any given time about 1 in every 25 inpatients has an infection related to hospital care according to data from the @entity72			1
the most common health care - associated infections were pneumonia , surgical site infections , gastrointestinal infections , urinary tract infections , and bloodstream infections			0
this latest report found the most improvement was in the mistakes hospitals make with a patient 's drugs			1
too often patients get hurt because they 've been given too much medicine or a hospital has given them a drug they are allergic to or they are even giving the wrong drug			1
there was a 40 % reduction in these kind of mistakes			1
the report also found there were fewer patients that developed bed sores and fewer patients who experienced infections from catheters			1
fixing this problem has been a big priority for the industry and for the government that has spent years working on ways to compel hospitals to better protect their patients			2
it 's unclear from the report what made the most difference			0
new financial incentives from @entity50 to make fewer mistakes may have played a role			1
technological advances could also be key			0
all of this is good news for patients and it is great news for the health care system itself			2
fewer mistakes saved $ 12 billion over the past three years according to the report			0
while she said there is still more work to do , hhs secretary @entity125 seemed happy about the progress			0
she called the results " welcome news for patients and their families			0
" " these data represent significant progress in improving the quality of care that patients receive while spending our health care dollars more wisely			2
@entity20 will work with partners across the country to continue to build on this progress			0
