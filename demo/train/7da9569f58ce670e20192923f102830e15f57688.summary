-- we were laying side by side , both face deep in our iphones -- checking our email one last time before going to sleep , setting our alarm clocks for the next morning , basically saying goodbye to the day			1
i turned to him , his face lit by the tiny screen , and watched him scroll through his @entity12 newsfeed			1
" anything exciting ? " i asked			1
" my cousin really loves @entity15			1
check out the exclamation marks			1
" " should we change our relationship status ? " i asked , as if that were the natural follow - up			1
we had only been dating for two months , but we had been writing partners for seven months , so it felt like a perfectly normal and logical next step to broadcast our love on @entity12			1
plus , we had both been single for the past three years and had never had a little graphic heart next to our names			1
this was going to be fun			1
" um , " he started to mutter			2
the @entity0 : 10 biggest dating mistakes on @entity12 oh no. not another guy who did n't want to claim me			1
i had been engaged to a man , who upon proposing , told me he wanted to " wait to feel joy " before getting me a ring			2
a year and a half went by -- no ring , and apparently no joy			2
" what ? you do n't want people to know you have a girlfriend ? " i asked , sitting straight up in bed			2
" no , @entity42 , that 's not it			1
it 's that i do n't have anything up right now			1
i 'm not listed as single or anything			2
so it seems weird to change it			1
" " i 'm listed as single , " i said in a hands - on - hips kind of way			2
" that 's not good , " he said , thinking about it for a second			1
" ok , let 's do it			1
he clicked on his personal information and answered all the prompts			2
he could choose : " in a relationship " or " in a relationship with @entity67			1
" if he wanted to put me down as his girlfriend , i would have to approve			2
" done , " he said , turning to me			2
" the @entity0 : 25 guys types who are hot , but why ? i tried to log in , but every time i did , it logged me out , in true buggy @entity76 fashion			2
he jumped out of bed and brought in his laptop			2
" we 're doing this , " he said and handed it to me			2
i followed the same prompts , and voila we were an @entity86 couple ! i started to laugh			1
" so , that just happened			2
" " let the commenting begin , " he said , and kissed me goodnight			2
i figured i might get one or two " likes , " maybe a comment here or there , but when i woke up in the morning , i had six thumbs - up and four comments with smiley faces and tons of exclamation marks , trumping his cousin 's love for @entity15 for sure			1
by the end of the day , i had 21 " likes " and 13 comments			1
i was not expecting that			0
i switched over to his page and saw that no one had commented on his relationship status change			1
people commented on his posts and updates all the time			0
i really did n't understand			0
i checked back the next day and he had one comment from an old teacher : " she must be very special to merit this announcement			0
i liked that she was happy for him , but it still seemed weird that no one else had hopped on the " @entity124 ! " bandwagon			0
the @entity0 : travel as a couple without killing each other a few days later , we were eating quinoa pasta , when i turned to him , and asked , " can you believe everyone 's crazy response to my relationship status change ? " " well , " he said , " you are beloved			1
" " so are you , " i insisted			0
he grinned and nodded in concession , as if i had just won a popularity contest			0
" i really think it 's because i 'm a woman			1
" i really did think that			0
men are n't told they 're not going to be ok without a girlfriend or wife			0
if they 're still single , no matter what age , it 's considered socially acceptable , cool even			1
i tried to look at the facts			0
we had both been single for the past three years			0
ok , that 's a big difference			1
being a 37 - year - old woman definitely has its pressures , not only from overactive , pleading ovaries , but also from random old ladies			0
" so , are you dating anyone ? you know you should really think about freezing your eggs			0
" he sure did n't have anyone telling him what he should do with his sperm			0
i guess the biggest difference between us is that i survived a broken engagement			0
but i was the one to break it off , so it was more of a victory than defeat			0
i had gotten to the point where i truly , in my heart , knew i would rather be alone for the rest of life than to be with a man who did n't want me			0
it was a hard transition though			0
i went from sleeping in on sundays with someone wrapped around me , to not being able to go to bed until four in the morning from anxiety about what my life was going to look like			0
i started to enjoy my time alone			0
i liked being able to have my out - of - town girlfriends spend the night on the couch in old - school , slumber party fashion and that i could go to the movies and sit wherever i wanted and that i could visit my family without having to worry about someone else being bored or stressed out or having nothing to say			0
it was just me and myself , and i loved it			0
i had even come to peace with the fact that i may never get married or have children			0
sure , i wanted that , but i could find ways to love in the world			0
i started counseling 8th grade girls			0
i had tons of friends			1
i had a lover here and there			0
i was going to be just fine			0
so , why was everyone so over-the - moon happy for me ? the @entity0 : celebrity " @entity208 " i could look at it one of two ways			0
i am a loving person and friends were happy that i had finally found someone to really love me back			1
or , whether people admitted it or not , they felt relieved that i was no longer alone , as if everything were going to be ok now , because , for as far as we 've come , there 's still the underlying belief that a woman needs a man to be complete			1
i am certainly happy to have a boyfriend i love and who loves me back , but honestly , i would have preferred if friends and family had celebrated my @entity12 single status with the same gusto			1
learning to love being alone is hard , and , in my opinion , is worth way more " likes " than an added " heart " next to your name			1
too bad there is n't an icon that indicates : " i 'm single , just went to a yoga class , bought some flowers , and feel really good about myself these days			0
