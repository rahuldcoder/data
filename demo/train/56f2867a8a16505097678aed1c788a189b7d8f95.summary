-- @entity2 test pilots and managers celebrated friday after the long - awaited inaugural flight of the @entity5 went off without a hitch			1
aviation enthusiasts around the world had their eyes on @entity10 as the aircraft took off from @entity12 around 10 a.m. local time and landed safely about four hours later			2
the test crew waved an @entity2 flag from a hatch above the cockpit as the aircraft taxied after its successful maiden journey			2
the crew , who emerged to applause from waiting friends and family , said the aircraft proved easy to handle and performed well throughout the test program			2
" after the first few minutes , it did n't feel like we were doing a first test flight , " said @entity26 , chief test pilot for @entity2			1
" it was so relaxed and so predictable			0
" " it 's a great day for all people who have a passion for aerospace , " said @entity2 chief executive officer @entity31			2
@entity2 hopes to have the new aircraft fully certified for commercial flight within 12 to 13 months , he said			0
" this is about going fast but never rushing , and i am very confident that after this first flight ... we will deliver this aircraft by 2014 to our first customers , " he said			0
@entity2 hopes to capture more than half the global market of 6,000 long - range aircraft over the next 20 years , he added			0
" i knew it was going to be impressive , but i was blown away , " @entity2 chief operating officer @entity45 said immediately after the @entity5 takeoff			1
" did you hear how quiet it was ? did you hear what you did n't hear ? we 're going to set new standards			0
not just for comfort , not just for performance			0
people living around airports wo n't even know we 're taking off , " he said to the attending press			0
the flight followed many hours of training in a simulator for the six international test flight crew members			1
@entity31 said he had set a target nine months ago of completing the first test flight before the upcoming @entity66			1
however , the company has not confirmed speculation that @entity2 is planning to show off its new plane to aviation enthusiasts at the show , which runs june 17 to 23			0
@entity72 , an @entity2 test pilot who watched from the ground , said the decision had not yet been made but would depend on the data from the test flight and safety checks over the next few days			1
@entity66 2013 : on your marks , jet set , go ! the @entity5 is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes @entity2 designed to go head - to - head with rival @entity86 's @entity85 and 777s			1
" xwb " means " extra wide body			0
" there are three members in the @entity5 family : the @entity5 , the @entity92 and the @entity93 , which seat 270 , 314 and 350 passengers , respectively , in three - class seating			1
the first test plane , " @entity97 , " was unveiled on may 13 at @entity2 headquarters in @entity99 , @entity10			1
turbulent production history friday 's first test flight was the latest achievement in what has been a turbulent production history for the @entity5 program since it was first announced in 2006			1
" @entity2 's initial @entity5 design was n't an entirely new aircraft , but a knee - jerk reaction to the 787 , " aviation journalist @entity106 , air transport editor of @entity107 , told @entity0 in an earlier report			1
" the company , which was hip - deep in sorting out @entity114 development , simply had n't foreseen the huge pent - up demand for a more efficient 250 - seat airliner , and tried to take the easy way out by offering a re-engined version of its @entity119			0
" while the @entity119 is incredibly popular , the airlines were more interested in the potential efficiency offered by a clean - sheet design , he added			0
@entity2 rolls out new @entity5 being publicly lambasted by some of its largest customers -- one aviation executive called it a @entity128 reaction to the @entity85 , while the ceo of @entity130 said the plane just did n't go far enough -- the pressure was on for @entity2 to come up with a plane that would genuinely advance the global aviation scene			1
this year , there were cancellations			0
@entity138 - based airline @entity137 axed seven orders for @entity140 , saying they still were n't happy with the design , criticizing its range , performance and fuel burn			0
" @entity2 belatedly woke up and countered with a completely new version of the @entity5 , and managed to tap into the market , " said @entity106			2
on the technical side , the big appeal for airlines is that over 70 % of the @entity5 's airframe is made from advanced materials that combine composites ( 53 % ) , titanium and advanced aluminum alloys			1
the @entity5 is the first @entity2 passenger jet to use both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fiber - reinforced polymer , resulting in lower fuel burn as well as easier maintenance , according to the company			1
its rival , the 787 , is one of the most advanced airliners launched in recent years , and is made up of 50 % composites and uses 20 % less fuel than other aircraft in the same category			0
@entity5 time crunch @entity66 hopes industry experts said ahead of the test flight that there was an outside chance the @entity5 might be spotted in the skies at the air show , even though @entity2 had said the plane would be too busy carrying out flight tests to attend			1
" we 're still waiting to find out whether the @entity5 will put in an appearance , " said @entity179 , editor of aerospace industry magazine @entity180			2
" that certainly would be a highlight -- it 's one of the newest and most exciting aircraft , but it and @entity188 's @entity187 are at a critical point in their development			0
" it becomes a bit of a fight between the marketing people , the publicists , who want the company to get all the best headlines , and the engineers who are working to critical deadlines to get the plane ready to fly as soon as possible , " he explained			0
" what may happen is they pop in for one day -- fly in and then fly out again -- or even , in the case of the @entity5 , that they do a flypast , without even landing			2
" follow all the action at the 2013 @entity66 via our @entity208 list @entity0 's @entity210 contributed to this report .			2

the first @entity5 test flight comes to a successful end in @entity99 , @entity10
" i knew it was going to be impressive , but i was blown away , " says @entity216
the @entity5 is designed to go head - to - head with rival @entity86 's @entity85 and 777s
there 's still no confirmation of an @entity5 appearance at @entity66
