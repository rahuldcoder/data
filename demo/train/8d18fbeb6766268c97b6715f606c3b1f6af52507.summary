-- @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity1 had been looking forward to it more than anything else			2
" i was 4 years old in may of 1980 and already a certified ' @entity7 ' maniac , " he said			1
" i had a slew of the toys , and they were my most prized possessions			2
" on the fateful day when he went to see " @entity13 , " the second movie in the original " @entity7 " trilogy , @entity2 had little patience for the movie to start			1
" i remember that my mom and i were going to see the movie with my aunt , and i found the wait to get to the theater at the local mall in @entity22 , @entity1 , excruciating , " he said			1
" after what seemed like an eternity , we were finally seated at the theater , and the familiar ' @entity7 ' title logo was blazing from the screen , larger than life , with the opening crawl going by as fast as i could read it			2
for the next two hours , i was riveted to the screen			0
" there is one moment everyone remembers from the " @entity13 " more than anything else : the revelation that @entity37 is , in fact , @entity38 's father			1
then 9 - year - old @entity40 remembers the moment well			0
" i heard from some kids that @entity37 was @entity38 's father , and even though it was spoiled , it made me want to see it even more , " he said			0
still , that was nothing compared to hearing vader himself say it in the movie			0
he vividly remembers the reaction he and his friends had at the time			1
" we were just kind of frozen and just kind of gaped at each other			0
" for @entity40 , there were little moments that stood out as well , like seeing the back of @entity37 's head			0
" it really creeped me out and fascinated me when i was little			0
" it 's moments like these that left a mark on so many " @entity7 " fans			1
thirty years to the day after its release , @entity67 and others are remembering what made " @entity72 " so special and how it 's affected them to this day			1
@entity73 : why " @entity72 " mattered for @entity78 , seeing the movie for the first time " was extremely tense ... you 've heard on the ' edge of your seat ' expression			1
i was literally on the edge of my seat the whole time			1
i have n't had an experience like that since , " she said			0
" for people in my age bracket , that was the first time there were special effects like that			2
" since then , @entity93 has amassed quite the collection of " @entity7 " @entity96 dispensers			0
after a journey to @entity100 , the first appearance of @entity102 , seeing fan favorite @entity103 in the flesh , @entity98 frozen in carbonite ( which " literally made me fall out of my seat in terror , " according to @entity2 ) and a cliffhanger ending , the credits rolled			0
after that , these fans would never be the same			2
" this movie was opening my mind to the infinite potential that was possible in the universe and within me , " @entity2 said			0
" @entity102 's admonition to ' do or do not ' became my personal motto before i was old enough to know what a motto was , and a lifelong love of science and flight was born that continues to this day			0
i tell people all the time that if it was n't for ' @entity7 , ' and especially ' @entity72 , ' i probably would n't be an aerospace engineer today			1
" @entity73 : " @entity72 " changed my life @entity2 is far from the only person whose life took a new direction after seeing the movie			1
@entity134 actually married a " stormtrooper			1
" " when i saw ' @entity72 ' for the first time , i cried ( in the best possible way )			1
i walked out of the theater transformed , and it was like i was seeing things differently for the first time , " she said			2
before she even returned home , 9 - year - old @entity134 immediately began collecting merchandise from the movie and drawing her own posters with " @entity7 " themes			1
soon after , she wished to meet a boy who loved " @entity7 " as much as she did			0
a year later , she got her first job , with her only motivation to buy more " @entity7 " toys			0
many jobs later , she worked at a press junket for the final " @entity7 " movie , " @entity154 , " on @entity155 , and she met one of the many stormtroopers there made available for filmmaking			0
" the first thing i said to him was ' are n't you a little short for a stormtrooper ? ' " her wish from years before would soon come true			2
on may 4 , 2008 , they were married at the @entity166 in @entity167 , @entity168 , with many other stormtroopers , " @entity170 " and " @entity37 " in attendance			0
( @entity134 is actually one of two @entity67 who had an elaborate " @entity7 " - themed wedding			1
) @entity73 : i married a stormtrooper the movie holds a special place in the heart of many hardcore fans like @entity134			1
comedian @entity179 counts himself among those fans			2
" puppets , robots , lightsabers , crater monsters , carbonite , the tauntaun sleeping bag and @entity103			0
how can you not love this movie ? " he said			0
" ' @entity72 ' is the one film that i have watched so many times that i actually wore out the videotape and broke it when i was a kid			1
" @entity179 was one of many celebrity fans who attended a charity screening of the movie on wednesday night			2
surprisingly , it also develops characters , mythology and keeps you invested in the relationships as well as the action , " he said			0
" plus the effects look really good			0
@entity102 , in puppet form , looks more real than 98 percent of @entity205 creatures you see in movies			0
it 's crazy to think that the advancement of technology actually hindered the prequels			0
" ireporter @entity212 refuses to even acknowledge the prequels : " in my mind , they do not exist ! " he is one of the purists , or as he calls them , " true ' @entity7 ' fans " who did n't even like the 1997 special editions released in theaters , saying they ruined the original trilogy			2
@entity73 : " @entity72 " was the best @entity40 might not go quite that far , but he certainly remembers the " @entity72 " era fondly			1
he literally wrote the book on the subject : " collect all 21 ! memoirs of a @entity227 30 years			1
" from " the biggest one - two punch cliffhanger ending ever , " to the endless amounts of merchandise available , memories always come flooding back when @entity40 thinks about " @entity72			1
" " [ anything ] from that time stirs nerves of excitement and anticipation			2
' @entity72 ' is the best in the ' @entity7 ' bunch			1

30 years later , fans remember seeing " @entity13 " for the first time
for some fans , it was a turning point in their lives
@entity134 got her wish to marry a @entity248
