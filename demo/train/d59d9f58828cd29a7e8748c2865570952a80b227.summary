tensions between @entity2 president @entity1 and @entity4 prime minister @entity3 have been strained for years			1
but the conflict in @entity7 has ushered in a new low , some analysts say			0
" it 's probably the worst relationship between a leader of the @entity2 and a leader of @entity4 since all the way back to the @entity18 days , " says @entity9 , a senior political analyst for @entity10 who served as adviser to four @entity2 presidents			1
" the relationship has gotten rockier over this period during the war			0
" while @entity1 and @entity3 emphasize friendship and mutual support publicly , a series of recent events present a different picture			1
blaming @entity4 for an attack that killed several people at a school in @entity7 , the @entity2 said it was " appalled " by the " disgraceful shelling " -- sharp criticism from @entity32 rarely heard when @entity4 is engaged in battle			1
" when you have a situation where innocent civilians are killed in @entity7 , there 's more that @entity4 can do to hold themselves to their own standards , " @entity35 spokeswoman @entity34 said			1
" we do hold ourselves to a very high standard			0
and when innocent civilians are caught in the cross fire between us and @entity47 , it 's an operational failure from our point of view , " @entity4 government spokesman @entity45 countered on @entity10			1
more than than 1,800 @entity50 have been killed in @entity7 during the conflict , according to the @entity52			0
the @entity53 estimates about 70 % were civilians , but @entity55 say about 900 militants were killed , as were 64 @entity4 soldiers and three civilians in @entity4			1
@entity3 did not deny reports that he told @entity2 secretary of state @entity60 and @entity2 ambassador to @entity4 @entity62 " not to ever second - guess me again " on how to deal with @entity47 , which is in charge of the @entity50 government in @entity7			1
@entity47 has launched hundreds of attacks , including rockets , against @entity4 civilians			1
in describing its military action publicly , @entity4 officials have compared it to @entity2 military actions against terrorism			1
@entity2 anti-terror tactics in recent years have included drone strikes , which @entity1 has increased in @entity75 and @entity76			1
hundreds of civilians , including children , have been killed , according to @entity79			0
so when the @entity2 slams civilian deaths in @entity4 military actions , @entity4 can in turn point to @entity2 military actions -- including wars in @entity84 and @entity85 -- that also have killed civilians			1
" that 's a logical , compelling argument , and @entity4 have made it repeatedly , " says @entity89 , who served as an adviser on @entity92 - @entity4 negotiations under both @entity93 and @entity95 administrations			1
that resonates with the @entity2 public , @entity89 says			2
but it does not speak to a central concern for @entity1			2
" his priority is to make the bad pictures from @entity7 go away ... he is much more focused on the middle class than on the @entity106			0
" why things are different with @entity1 there 's always been some dysfunction in the @entity2 - @entity4 relationship , says @entity89 , now a vice president with the @entity106 program at the @entity113			1
but there have also been strong personal connections			0
" i loved him as much as anyone i 've ever known , " @entity116 once said of slain @entity4 prime minister @entity117			2
but @entity1 and @entity3 " have n't liked each other from the beginning , " @entity9 says			2
in 2011 , inadvertently open microphones caught @entity124 president @entity123 calling @entity3 " a liar , " followed by @entity1 's reply : " you 're tired of him ; what about me ? i have to deal with him every day , " according to reports			2
despite differences , in the past , @entity2 and @entity4 administrations " got a lot done " together , @entity89 says			1
by contrast , he says , the @entity1 administration " ca n't produce anything			2
" " these guys have n't found a project on which they can basically cooperate			0
" while united in the goal of preventing @entity140 from getting nuclear weapons -- which @entity142 insists it is not seeking -- @entity1 and @entity3 are split in how to go about it			2
and @entity60 is " is 0 - for - 3 , " @entity89 says			0
his nine months of pushing for peace talks failed , as did his two efforts to achieve a cease - fire to halt the hostilities in recent weeks			2
the truce under way now was brokered by @entity151 -- and apparently quite similar to the @entity151 cease - fire plan that @entity4 accepted and @entity47 rejected throughout the conflict			2
@entity89 believes a " generational divide " on @entity4 separates @entity1 from preceding presidents			1
@entity116 and president @entity156 felt " emotionally bonded to @entity4 , " @entity89 says			2
" ' too big to fail ' despite the tensions , the countries remain critical allies , analysts say			0
@entity3 on sunday praised president @entity1 's " unequivocal stand with @entity4 on our right to defend ourselves " as well as the " untiring efforts " of @entity60			1
he also called @entity62 " a great ambassador			0
" and @entity167 spokesman @entity166 said " the nature of the relationship is strong and unchanged			0
" at a joint appearance in march , @entity1 said , " there 's nobody i 've met with more or consulted with more than @entity3			0
and it 's a testimony to the incredible bond between our two nations			0
i 've said before and i will repeat , we do not have a closer friend or ally than @entity4 and the bond between our two countries and our two peoples in unbreakable			0
and that 's the reason why on a whole spectrum of issues we consult closely			0
" the @entity2 has continued supplying @entity4 with weapons during the conflict			1
and documents revealed by @entity189 leaker @entity188 allegedly detail how the @entity2 shares raw intelligence data with @entity4			1
" the relationship is one between two close allies and there is tension between them at this moment , " says @entity192 , senior analyst with the @entity193			0
they can " overcome " it " once the conflict is ended , " says @entity200 of the @entity201			0
outside of their top leaders , the connection between the two countries seems unshakeable , analysts say			0
" unlike @entity209 , " says @entity89 , " this relationship is too big to fail			0

" probably the worst relationship " for @entity2 , @entity4 leaders since @entity18 , an analyst says
in the past , @entity2 and @entity4 administrations " got a lot done , " an analyst says
" generational divide " separates @entity1 from previous presidents , an analyst says
recent strain can be " overcome " after hostilities end , an analyst says
