@entity0 -- budget cuts from sequestration or overall austerity measures had nothing to do with the @entity3 using an outside company to screen contractors for access to bases , the @entity3 chief of operations said wednesday in response to a scathing federal audit of the @entity16 program			1
the audit , made public tuesday , cited security problems it said were so severe that it recommended immediately closing the @entity20 -- @entity20 -- for security reasons			2
in particular , the audit said dozens of convicted felons got unescorted access to @entity3 installations for weeks and even years because the outside company issued temporary credentials to contractors before completing proper background checks			1
the @entity30 inspector general 's audit also found the program , intended to save money , probably wound up costing tax dollars instead			2
coming a day after a contractor opened fire at the @entity36 , killing 12 people and dying himself , the audit amounted to a powerful indictment of security measures at @entity3 facilities			1
it also came as defense secretary @entity43 ordered a worldwide review of security at military bases			0
there is no connection between the @entity20 and @entity49 , 34 , the it contractor and former veteran who carried out the attack at the historic naval facility 2.5 miles from the @entity55			2
@entity49 had a different kind of pass that was not issued through the @entity20 , the @entity3 said			1
however , the audit revealed security loopholes that potentially put personnel at risk at 10 @entity3 installations around the country that were studied as a sample of the more than 60 located in the continental @entity65			1
@entity36 : storied past , home today to high - ranking personnel wasted money at a @entity71 hearing on wednesday , adm. @entity69 told legislators that the @entity3 would work with the inspector general 's office to reconcile the recommendations in the audit , though he stopped short of accepting all of them			1
@entity69 also declared that the decision to use the outside company to screen @entity3 contractors , while a " cost - control measure , " had " nothing to do with budget shortfalls or sequestration itself			1
" " we do n't cut budgetary corners for security , " @entity69 said			0
" the two are unrelated			0
" sequestration comprises mandatory government budget cuts that took effect earlier this year			0
in response to the audit , legislators said tuesday that the @entity20 should be discontinued			0
" this program wasted money , allowed dozens of felons access to installations they should never have had , and utterly lacked competent oversight , " said @entity97 sen. @entity96 of @entity98 , who requested that the inspector general review the contract after receiving a tip from a whistle - blower in june 2012			1
" it 's clear that its existence constitutes an unnecessary danger to the @entity3 and its personnel and it should be discontinued immediately			2
" @entity115 rep. @entity114 of @entity116 , who sits on the @entity71 , told @entity1 that the audit caused " great concern " because " the report itself specifically says that people at these facilities remain at risk as long as this system is in place			0
" in its formal response to the audit , the @entity3 accepted some recommendations for further review and analysis of the @entity20 but it rejected the call to end the program , saying it meets all federal requirements for background checks			1
discontinuing the program that handled more than 14 million safe visits would result in " unnecessarily long lines " at access points to @entity3 installations , the @entity3 response said			1
called @entity16 by its operating company , @entity140 , the @entity20 began screening and credentialing for most contractors and other commercial workers at @entity3 bases more than two years ago			1
while the military issues credentials to its personnel , @entity20 handles workers from government contractors who choose to pay a fee for credentials in a process that includes a background check			0
contractors unwilling to pay the fee can apply for day passes , while the @entity16 system offers up to a year of unfettered access			2
audit reports @entity3 risked security to cut costs , says source almost 300,000 contractors enrolled according to the audit , there were 9,657 companies and 64,924 individuals enrolled in @entity167 near the end of 2011			1
as of march 1 of this year , the numbers had grown to 30,702 companies enrolled with 298,204 individual participants , it said			0
many of the contractors got interim passes while @entity140 was still conducting a background check required by military regulations , and others got full credentials without having been fully vetted as required through the @entity181 database and the @entity182 , the audit said			0
in addition , seven of the 10 bases visited by auditors lacked sufficient resources to conduct the required background checks for contractors seeking day passes instead of paying to take part in the @entity20 , it said			0
" as a result , 52 convicted felons received routine , unauthorized access to @entity3 installations for 62 to 1,035 days , " the audit said , adding that " this placed military personnel , dependents , civilians , and installations at an increased security risk			1
" vetting military contractors : how did the @entity36 gunman get in ? felony crimes by those who received improper access included intent to distribute cocaine , assault , theft and throwing a missile at an occupied vehicle , according to the audit			1
it also challenged the contention by @entity3 officials that the @entity16 program amounted to a money saving move because of the fees paid by contractors for credentials			1
" the cost reportedly absorbed by contractors to obtain @entity16 credentials are transferred back to the @entity3 in the form of higher contract overhead costs and other contract fees , " the audit said , adding that the lack of transparent accounting meant that the @entity3 " is unable to account for actual @entity20 - related charges from contractor companies			2
" for example , it said , the @entity3 incurred @entity20 - related charges of at least $ 1.28 million for 17 of the more than 30,000 contractor companies enrolled in the program			2
in a statement wednesday , @entity140 ceo @entity236 said the company welcomed audits and " looks forward to working with the @entity30 to further refine and advance the world 's best high - assurance identity management solution			0
" the statement contained no direct response to specific findings of the audit			0
what is security like at the @entity36 ? @entity248 ordered a worldwide review of physical security measures at all @entity65 military installations following monday 's shooting			2
the @entity30 also is expected to review security clearances and access standards for contractors and other employees , according to a @entity30 official			0
at the @entity55 on tuesday , spokesman @entity258 told reporters that the director of national intelligence " is currently undertaking a review of the security clearance policy for certain contractors			0
" in addition , he said , president @entity264 directed the @entity266 was " examining standards for contractors and employees across federal agencies			0
" did @entity264 strike the wrong tone after the @entity36 shootings ? @entity1 's @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
