@entity4 is already a major source of natural resources for @entity1 and with @entity4 economies now some of the world 's fastest growing , it 's also an emerging a marketplace for @entity38 - made goods			1
trade between @entity4 and @entity1 totaled $ 200 billion in 2012 , according to @entity38 state media , and the country is @entity4 's largest trading partner			1
@entity4 leaders have welcomed @entity1 's no - strings investment as a counterbalance to @entity67 aid that is usually conditional on reducing poverty , stamping out corruption or introducing democratic reforms			1
