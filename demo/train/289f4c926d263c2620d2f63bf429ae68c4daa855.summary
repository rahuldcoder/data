" they gave @entity3 the most precious thing they had , the last full measure of devotion			0
and because they did , we are who we are today : a free and prosperous nation , the greatest in the world			0
" what to know about @entity13 he continued , " they risk their lives , and many give their lives , for something larger than themselves or any of us : the ideals of liberty and justice that make @entity3 a beacon of hope for the world			2
that 's been true throughout our history -- from our earliest days , when a tiny band of revolutionaries stood up to an empire , to our 9/11 generation , which continues to serve and sacrifice today			0
" @entity1 further urged @entity3 to " do more than remember : " to care for the loved ones the fallen soldiers leave behind ; to ensure that veterans have adequate care , jobs and benefits ; and to support military missions at home and abroad			1
by the numbers : @entity13 and veterans the speech comes at a time when the administration is dogged by controversy			1
while facing tough questions about the alleged @entity195 targeting of conservative groups and his administration 's response to the attack on the @entity3 @entity200 in @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity1 also answered questions last week about the use of drones , the closing of the @entity208 detention center and sexual assault in the military			1
in a thursday speech , he said drones are a necessary evil but one that must be used more judiciously as the @entity3 security situation evolves			0
about @entity208 , he said he would push @entity215 to allow him to shut down " a facility that should never have been opened			0
" on friday , responding to a @entity218 report that the number of cases of unwanted sexual contact had jumped 35 % between 2010 and 2012 , @entity1 said the attacks threaten the trust and discipline that is the military 's backbone			1
