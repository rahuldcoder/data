-- imagine a mother , ostracized and isolated for years because her son is mentally ill , suddenly receiving thousands of messages of support , thanking her for coming forward and calling her heroic			1
that 's what @entity6 experienced after @entity8 published my story and @entity12 ' video , " my son is mentally ill , " so listen up			1
the response has been overwhelming			0
thousands of messages via e-mail , @entity15 and @entity16 have poured in -- from across @entity19 and from around the world , including @entity21 , the @entity22 and @entity23			1
many were from mothers fighting their private struggle with their own children , from fathers , from nurses , from psychiatrists			0
others opened up their hearts , describing years of agony dealing with their own mental illness before stabilizing			1
my inbox was flooded with supportive messages that were forwarded on to @entity6			2
many carried this message : please know that it can get better			0
" i ca n't thank you enough on behalf of all the mothers out there that deal with mentally ill children , " one mom e-mailed			2
" i admire that woman so greatly for what she does and for the entire family allowing to share their story			1
" legislation seeks to improve mental health system @entity6 risked much in coming forward , especially the fear it could send her son in a downward spiral			1
one family doctor even objected to her doing so			0
but she felt that educating the nation about the struggles of raising a child with mental illness was worth it -- and that in so doing , her son could improve , too			1
her risk seems to have paid off			0
@entity6 shared some of the messages sent to the family with her son , @entity67 , who suffers from bipolar disorder with episodes of psychosis			1
his response astonished her : " @entity72 , i wanted to tell you that i finally can say that i accept myself for who i am , " he said			0
" i am not my mental illness ; i am me			1
" for @entity6 , that statement marked tremendous progress and underscored why she decided to speak out			0
her resolve has only intensified			0
the family has set up a website , @entity81 , for people to communicate with @entity6 and @entity67 and seek help			0
@entity6 hopes to create a foundation in the coming months to help change the stigma around mental illness			1
she also hopes to realize a longtime dream to speak to middle and high school students in @entity89			1
mental illness in children : where to turn one woman messaged via @entity16 that she had endured a similar struggle as @entity6 in raising her son , now a highly functioning 23 - year - old			1
" my advice to the mom you interviewed : be a bulldog on britches , never let go , " wrote @entity100			2

" readers also thanked us for our understanding and sensitivity in telling @entity6 and @entity67 's story			1
many parents raising mentally ill children said they wished they had the courage to tell their story like @entity6			2
on @entity15 , i received hundreds of messages echoing @ @entity116 's sentiment : " thank you for telling her story			1
represents so many stories around the country			0
" " this was a fantastic article , and i am heartened to see it published on @entity0 , " @entity120 said in an e-mail			0
" so many families and people are suffering under the incredible burden of dealing with mental illness , and it 's particularly difficult when it involves children			1
" many called the issue of mental illness the most important story of our time , yet one that is routinely ignored			1
they pointed out that children can now stay on their parents ' health care plans until the age of 26 , yet a mentally ill son or daughter can make all their own health care decisions when they turn 18 -- regardless of parental input			2
that 's resulted in our jails and prisons being filled with people with mental disorders , readers pointed out , and all too often our cemeteries , too			1
" the problem no one seems to address is when these kids turn 18 , we as parents no longer have control , " e-mailed @entity153 , a world champion boxer who cares for her mentally ill son			2
" the parents will tell the same the story : there was nothing we could do or our hands were tied			2
i have been fighting the system for years and nothing will change until we are granted rights to help our sick children			0

" @entity176 battled depression , but was a master at hiding his struggle			0
since losing my son , i have tried to learn everything i can about depression and other mood disorders			2
i was shocked to find out how many people battle mood disorders and how difficult it is to get treatment			0
" @entity171 emphasized another key point : mental illness affects rich and poor alike			1
the @entity191 had money and resources , yet it was n't enough			0
the most poignant outpouring came from those who could relate to @entity67			0
they shared very private struggles			0
most asked not to be identified , but said they wanted @entity67 to know there was hope			0
" i have a history of mental illness too , but am successfully functioning with medicine and years of support , " one reader wrote in an e-mail			1
" i celebrate all the parents and professionals who quietly , bravely fight for the sick ones			0
they suffer when they help , but we all suffer if we do n't help			0
" @entity6 and @entity67 are my heroes			0
i pray that we will be stronger and more compassionate after reading their story			0
" one of the most touching messages came from a mother who said her 9 - year - old son was hospitalized last year for 16 days for delusions , depression , anxiety and suicidal thoughts			2
" i have learned a lot since then about his illness , and even more the startling lack of available mental health resources and treatment options , even in a large city , " the mom wrote			1
the mother asked not to be identified , but she said @entity6 and @entity67 's story inspired her to put into words what she has been through			2
she wrote this poem , titled @entity233 , that she said could be shared with others : @entity235 we hid the knives but you really only wanted to fall from your window nine years is enough i 've had a good life you told me during a visit @entity245 where you still were n't sure if i was really your mom we played basketball in the dayroom and snuggled on worn bean bag chairs with our shoes off and our hopes high that the next day you 'd come home i took weary walks between visiting hours through corridors , concrete walkways and parking decks in the august swell texting @entity257 , @entity258 , 3d to myself digital bread crumbs for the evening return the contraband i carry fits in an empty locker lift the phone speak the code @entity235 hold for the buzz @entity267 one door wait for it to close so the other will open you , always on the other side , anxiously waiting reminding me i was 2 minutes late ( as if i did n't know ) and squeezing the remaining breath from my lungs with your little boy hugs i brought you fresh fruit in labeled cups @entity277 , grapes , oranges , and pineapple chunks the scent embedded in my flesh from cutting something sweet for you , my love my baby my boy my son			1
