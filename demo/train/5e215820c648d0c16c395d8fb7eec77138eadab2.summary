the disease is an incurable -- let 's change that -- progressive degenerative neurological disorder			1
for reasons that are still not completely understood , the nerve cells in my brain and spinal cord will gradually deteriorate			1
i will ultimately lose the ability to move , speak , swallow and finally breathe			2
@entity0 leads to complete paralysis			1
the average life expectancy is two to five years			1
this is not fun to talk about ! i have what is called familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis			2
only 5 % to 10 % of @entity0 patients have this genetic disposition			1
my grandmother @entity19 was diagnosed when i was in middle school			1
she passed away six years later			1
my mother , @entity21 , was diagnosed when i was in high school and has been living with this disease for 13 years			1
although most of my mom 's muscles have atrophied away , she 's the longest living @entity0 patient in her clinic			1
she is the most beautiful and inspirational person you will ever meet			2
four years ago , i graduated from @entity28 in @entity29 and moved back home to help care for my mom			1
i started a wedding photography business			2
i photographed weddings on the weekends and would help my mom during the weekdays while my stepfather was at work			2
i was fulfilling two passions : photographing 40 + weddings a year and spending much needed quality time with my mom			2
i loved it ! but then my hands , arms and shoulders started getting weak			2
i was carrying camera equipment all day , and it became increasingly more difficult to change settings and hold up my camera			2
after a wedding , i felt like i was hit by a bus			2
i was so incredibly exhausted , and it took my body a long time to recuperate			0
i thought i was just overdoing it , but realized i could n't ignore the symptoms anymore			0
on january 27 , 2014 , at 26 years old , i was diagnosed with @entity0			1
that day , hands down , was the most difficult day of my entire life			0
i cried uncontrollably in the doctor 's office			1
when i saw family in the waiting room , i just remember repeating the phrase , " it 's not fair " as my sister @entity59 hugged me without saying a word			1
somehow , i summed up the courage to tell my mom the same day			0
words ca n't describe the level of emotional pain she went through			0
i really hate thinking about it			0
the next day , i canceled 30 weddings i had booked for that year as a photographer			0
i sold all of my camera gear to refund the deposits			0
since then i 've lost the ability to button my clothes and open bottles			0
i feel like i have weights strapped to my body			0
taking a shower is a workout in itself			0
it sucks , but i try to be grateful for the abilities i have n't lost yet			0
the muscles in my upper body are constantly twitching and cramping			0
it 's a constant annoying reminder that my body is breaking down			1
i believe this is one of the reasons many people did n't really know what @entity0 was all about before the ice bucket challenge : no one wanted to talk about a depressing disease with no cure , no hope			1
we rarely discussed the lack of support surrounding this disease because it brought too much heartache			1
" be strong and positive for the family " is what i think most of us had in the back of our minds			0
but now @entity0 is finally out of the closet after the ice bucket challenge sensation this summer ! wahoo ! if there 's one thing i 've learned from my recent experiences is that we have to share our story , even if it 's difficult			1
how else can we rally the support we so desperately need ? one voice can and will make a difference			0
the challenge sparked hope , raised awareness and made a huge impact on launching new research initiatives , but we still need funds to find a cure			0
my family , including my new wife , @entity121 , and i have a sense of empowerment that we 've never had before			0
my quality of life is amazing right now , but it 's so great that i do n't want it to stop			1
i 'm grateful i 've found the love of my life			0
i just want to spend as much time as i can with her			0
let 's change the course of @entity0			1
please join me in this fight , and i 'd be so incredibly grateful .			0
