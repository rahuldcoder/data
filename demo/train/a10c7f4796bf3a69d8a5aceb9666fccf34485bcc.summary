-- @entity2 president @entity1 does not foresee a scenario of " @entity2 boots on the ground in @entity9 , " telling reporters friday that it would not be good for the @entity2 or for that county			1

" having said that , i do not foresee a scenario in which boots on the ground in @entity9 , @entity2 boots on the ground in @entity9 , would be good for @entity2 or be good for @entity9			0
" @entity1 said he has consulted with leaders in the region who want to see stability return to @entity9 , and " they agree with that assessment			1
" even so , the president said that if the @entity2 confirms the use of chemical weapons by the @entity9 government against its people , " that 's a game changer for us			1
" he did not elaborate on what steps would be taken , repeating as he has said previously that the @entity2 would wait until it has more details of evidence of chemical weapons use in @entity9 before making any decision on whether to alter strategy			1
" we have evidence that chemical weapons have been used			2
we do n't know when , where or how they were used , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 's assessment was supported by @entity46 , @entity47 's ambassador to the @entity2			0
" this was a military assessment of intelligence ; like all intelligence assessments , there 's no absolute certitude , " he told @entity0 's @entity48 on friday			0
" our assessment was confirmed by @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity2 sources			0
but it 's true that the usage of chemical weapons by the @entity9 regime or anybody in @entity9 is being closely monitored by our intelligence agency and continues to be discussed at the highest levels between the @entity47 and @entity2 governments			1
" but in recent days , the @entity67 has stepped up planning for potential military intervention in @entity9 , which would most likely include the use of fighter jets and cruise missiles , two administration officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter told @entity0			0
for now , @entity1 said , the @entity2 is continuing its investigation , and working with its @entity76 and @entity77 allies			0

the @entity86 estimates some 70,000 people have died in the fighting			0
@entity9 had denied the use of chemical weapons , accusing the @entity2 of manipulating evidence to pressure president @entity91 to step down			1

" we are actively engaged on a day - to - day basis to deal with this crisis to restore a @entity9 that is respectful of the rights and aspirations of the @entity9 people			2
" in addition to @entity9 's possible use of chemical weapons against rebels , another concern is that parts of the government 's stockpile of chemical weapons -- which analysts believe is one of the world 's largest and includes sarin , mustard and @entity122 gases -- could end up , if they have n't already , in others ' hands			1
