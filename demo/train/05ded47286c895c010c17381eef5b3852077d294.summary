@entity0 , @entity1 -- on the same day it ratcheted up its rhetoric against @entity5 , @entity1 on monday decided to put off an artillery drill on the island central to the latest conflagration between the two nations , state - run media reported			1
@entity1 military officials " delayed " the drill on @entity12 that had been scheduled for tuesday , according to the official @entity13			1
earlier , island residents had been told to move to bomb shelters for the drill			0
the announcement came as @entity5 stepped up its threats recently on its southern rival , as well as the @entity20 , if any military activities infringe on what the communist nation considers its territory			1
@entity1 earlier deployed more long - range artillery and rocket launchers to the border island in the @entity28 , which was struck by @entity30 shelling last week , according to military officials quoted by @entity13			1
also monday , @entity1 president @entity32 warned that @entity5 will face severe consequences if it launches another military attack across its southern border			1
" if the @entity38 commits any additional provocations against the @entity1 , we will make sure that it pays a dear price without fail , " @entity32 said in a nationally televised address			1
" we are aware of the historic lesson that a disgraceful peace achieved through intimidation only brings about greater harm in the end			0
" @entity32 said monday that @entity1 " can not remain patient " in the face of continued hostility from @entity48			2
" fellow citizens , at this point , actions are more important than words , " @entity32 said in a televised address			0

" the divided peninsula -- tense at the best of times -- has been near the boiling point since tuesday , when four people died in a @entity30 artillery barrage that targeted @entity12			0

@entity5 has consistently denied responsibility for the sinking of the @entity67 , which killed 46 @entity1 sailors			2
" it is difficult at this point to expect @entity5 to abandon its nuclear weapons or military adventurism , " @entity32 said			1
" we are now clearly aware that we can not stay patient and be generous			0
that will only give rise to bigger provocations			0
" @entity32 's address came a day after @entity1 and @entity20 forces started joint military exercises , prompting a furious response from @entity5			1
the aircraft carrier @entity84 joined @entity1 's forces near the coasts of @entity87 and @entity5 for the four - day drill , which the @entity89 called " no more than an attempt to find a pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost , " according to the official @entity95			1

and @entity20 sen. @entity133 , @entity134 , said on @entity2 's " @entity135 " on sunday that the flare - up exposed the failure of " continued appeasement " of @entity5 by @entity140 and @entity141 administrations			2
he said the @entity20 has given @entity5 more than $ 1 billion in aid over the past 15 years with the goal of getting them to the negotiating table			2
" it seems the purpose of everything is to get the @entity30 to the table , " said @entity133 , the ranking @entity140 on the @entity146			0
" the @entity30 ' only claim to their position on the world stage is their nuclear capability			0
and they have a terrible , most repressive , oppressive regime in the world			0
they have hundreds of thousands of people in slave labor camps			0
and all of that seems to be sacrificed in the altar of , quote , ' negotiations			0
' " meanwhile , the @entity84 - based @entity163 called for " an end to the @entity20 - @entity1 provocations " and announced rallies in @entity167 and @entity168 and @entity169 , @entity170 , on monday			1

in his monday speech , @entity1 's @entity32 said efforts to resolve the international standoff through negotiations and humanitarian assistance to the @entity89 were met with " nuclear development and the sinking of the @entity67			2
" he said the attack on @entity12 would have been unlawful even in wartime , adding , " i can not but be angered at their cruelty			0
" @entity5 said the @entity1 provoked the attack because shells from a @entity1 millitary drill landed in the @entity89 's waters			2
the @entity89 called reports of civilian casualties part of @entity1 's " propaganda campaign " and accused the " enemy " of creating " a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation			2
" the violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in @entity1			0
