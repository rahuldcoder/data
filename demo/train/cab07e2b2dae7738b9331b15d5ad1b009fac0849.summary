-- @entity1 celebrated wildly thursday with the news of longtime dictator @entity4 's death			1
but in the aftermath of that party , the country 's new leaders will awaken friday morning to the nation - building equivalent of a huge pile of dirty and broken dishes in the kitchen , not to mention a few bitter guests who are n't quite ready to leave , experts say			2
although @entity4 's death will probably end the possibility of an insurgency that could have sapped the new government 's time and energy , it will do little to heal the myriad divisions within the country , said @entity24 , director of the @entity25 at the @entity26			1
" the challenges are much greater than basically the celebration we are seeing today in western capitals , " he said			0
" and i think the morning after , we will wake up to a @entity1 that has changed very little in terms of really mending the rifts inside the country itself			2
" @entity1 celebrate death of longtime dictator those rifts include sharp divisions among rebel groups , such as leaders in the western city of @entity42 who have refused to recognize the eastern - based @entity43 as the country 's new government , @entity24 said			1
and with @entity4 dead , the primary unifying force that held the rebels together is gone , according to @entity49 analyst @entity48			1
" the one thing that held all the rebels together was the presence of @entity4 , even though the rebels had taken the capital and the focus was to essentially put down any form of @entity58 resistance wherever it may be , especially in his hometown , @entity62 , " @entity48 said			2
with that accomplished , the question for the rebels becomes whether they will be able to stick together and not " descend into a situation of chaos and civil war , " he said			0
as for what could happen to @entity1 after @entity4 , @entity24 said , look no farther than @entity70			1
the world celebrated with that nation 's people in february when intense demonstrations against the rule of longtime leader @entity76 forced him to relinquish power			0
several months later , the country is ruled by a military council , and fierce political struggles dominate			0
" the same thing applies to @entity1 , " @entity24 said			2
" in fact , @entity1 is much more divided than @entity70 or even @entity88 , " another @entity83 state that has witnessed protests against its leaders ' rule			2
the @entity43 has achieved remarkable progress since taking power , said @entity91 , a senior fellow at the @entity92 at the @entity93			0
" it got the electricity and water flowing ; they 've got the ( financial ) markets open			0
they 've got police on the street and even garbagemen collecting the garbage , " @entity91 said			0
" but many challenges remain			0
figuring out how to create a sense of national reconciliation in a country where few civil institutions survived @entity4 's rule is but one urgent task for the country 's new government , experts said			1
it must also deal with armed militias , restore basic services nationwide , make sure things such as @entity4 's chemical weapons stores are secured and tackle the mammoth tasks of creating a new constitution and government and scheduling elections			1
leaders also have to figure out how to deal with the trials of @entity4 regime members suspected of being involved in war crimes and address concerns of international human rights groups who fear that former rebels are mistreating and torturing prisoners			1
the @entity43 has put off dealing with many of those issues since toppling @entity4 's regime , said @entity136 , president of the @entity138 - @entity1 council			1
but with the former ruler dead and the last city loyal to him under government control , the nation 's new leaders can no longer use war to explain any lack of progress to the @entity1 people , @entity136 said			1
" there is no @entity4 for them to use as a crutch , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0

with @entity4 gone , @entity1 's new leaders must tackle *rebuilding* , analysts say
@entity4 's death reduces the risk of a *crippling* insurgency , a @entity1 expert says
but it also removes the primary unifying force that has held the rebellious groups together
*numerous* urgent issues await the new government
