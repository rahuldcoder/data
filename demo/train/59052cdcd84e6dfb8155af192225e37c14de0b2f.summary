-- @entity1 is like many people who go on tours or cruises alone : she does n't like to room with strangers , but she also hates paying a single supplement -- the fee many travel companies levy on singles who want their own two - person room			1
operators occasionally reduce the single supplement as the deadline to book a tour approaches			1
" it 's like a double punishment , " says the 51 - year - old @entity16 dentist			2
" you 're going alone , and you have to pay more for the pleasure			0
if you are feeling sorry for yourself , the single supplement is a real slap in the face			1
" because of high fuel prices and the struggling economy , however , some industry experts say that tour operators and cruise lines may have trouble filling their slots in the coming year -- meaning single travelers could have luck getting around the dreaded supplement			1
" but you need to know how to find the deals , " says @entity32 , author of " @entity33 : tales and @entity37 " and editor of @entity39 , a site for single living			2
" @entity43 supplements are like rack rates -- you can usually do better			2
" here are tips on how to find a sweeter deal : be the first one in line ... tour companies sometimes scrap the single supplement for the first few people who book trips the operators believe may not sell out			1
for example , @entity54 will waive the supplement for the first six people who sign up for a @entity59 trip to @entity60 in early 2009			1
@entity61 : tips from solo travelers to find this kind of early - bird special , ask a travel agent or check sites like sololady.com or @entity68 : @entity69			2
@entity70 lists its deals in a bimonthly newsletter that it e-mails to members -- the one - time fee to join is $ 50			2
your best bet is to start looking at least six months before a trip 's departure date , as most tours begin to fill up after that			0
... or wait till the last minute operators also occasionally reduce the single supplement as the deadline to book a tour approaches and they get desperate to sell any remaining spots			1
" if you can wait until the last week [ before the sign - up deadline ] , chances are you 'll get a deal , " says @entity86			2
" but it 's a risk - reward kind of thing			0
you could miss out on the trip altogether			0
" some companies , such as @entity95 , also offer what 's known as a " guaranteed share " : if they ca n't find a roommate for you before a certain date , you 'll get your own double room at no extra cost			0
this works only if there 's an odd number of men or women on a tour , so check in with the operator regularly before the deadline to see how many people have registered			2
last - minute deals are possible on cruises , too			0
some companies try to off - load unbooked cabins in the weeks before a departure by offering " happy hour " specials in which they reduce the supplement			1
the sales are typically held the same day they 're announced on the companies ' web sites , says @entity124 , a travel agent who founded a web site listing discounts on supplements for solo cruisers : @entity128			1
most travel agents receive advance warning of the sales			0
negotiate with the operator you can always turn on the charm and try to persuade the tour company to drop the supplement			1
if you 've got a good reason why you think you should n't have to pay , sell the operator on it			0
" i 've mentioned a recent divorce and a first trip after being widowed -- both true stories , " @entity86 says			0
" usually , i ask the company to waive the single supplement and then hope for an upgrade			2
" sometimes , you do n't even need to give the company a reason -- just be friendly and make your preference for a private room clear			0
" the person who makes the best impression will definitely stand out in the operator 's mind and could receive a single room if it becomes available , " says @entity150 , author of " @entity151 : the @entity157			0
" small - scale tour operators , such as @entity159 and @entity160 , generally have more flexibility than larger companies when it comes to giving single travelers a break on fees			1
" if the owner answers the phone , he can strike a deal right on the spot , " says @entity167 , president and co-owner of @entity160			0
" with a large company , the reservationist ca n't really diverge from official policy			0
" he says to sweet - talk the booking agent by saying you will recommend the trip to friends and by stressing your discretion : " assure the operator that you will not share information about your discount with other travelers on the tour			2
" travel when others do n't discounts for singles abound in the less busy off - season -- summer in @entity192 and the @entity193 , winter in @entity194 -- when tours and resorts have difficulty filling all their spaces			1
@entity200 , for example , has no supplement on 11 of its tours in @entity60 this winter , saving people as much as $ 550 per trip			1
at the @entity208 resort in the @entity209 and @entity210 , there was no supplement for solo travelers who booked a double room this past june			0
the off - season is also a good time to save on the supplement on cruise ships , although the companies often do not advertise the deals			1
for example , @entity124 says that some cruise lines , such as @entity222 , charge less for the supplement on what they call " repositioning cruises , " when companies move their ships from their summer cruising waters to their winter waters ( from the @entity231 to the @entity193 in the fall ) , or vice versa			1
" these kinds of specials are out there with the mainstream brands , but they 're not so easy to find , " she notes			0
" you should have a travel agent look on your behalf			0
" try a @entity60 operator tour companies based in @entity60 are also less likely to charge a supplement , mainly because the fee is not an accepted part of the culture there			1
" @entity60 are not as couple - oriented when it comes to travel , " says @entity86			1
" plus , they 're more cost - conscious and simply would not agree to pay the supplement , so tour operators have less choice			1
the market drives the cost			0
" in addition , @entity60 companies often offer accommodations in family - run pensions and older hotels , which have rooms of varying sizes -- including single rooms			1
for instance , @entity262 , a @entity263 operator that specializes in organizing trips for singles , provides most of its customers with their own room at no additional charge			2
