@entity1 @entity2 -- could the era of spend , spend , spend be about to end ? what is the biggest personal problem ordinary people face ? the answer increasingly , is debt			1
in the last 15 years countries such as the @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 have enjoyed an economic golden age			1
for many consumers it seems there is no product or experience that is out of reach as long as you have a few credit cards in your wallet			2
it 's been the era of " because i 'm worth it , " $ 1,000 " it " handbags , celebrity worship , four credit cards apiece and vacations abroad			1
but a flip side is emerging from this era of excess , with potent signs in the last week that the party is coming to a close			1
there have been warnings signs in the @entity10 this week that the economy is slowing			1
rising @entity10 home foreclosures and a persistent housing slump have triggered a @entity10 credit crunch which has unsettled global markets and raised concerns about a possible economic slowdown			1
the @entity48 's chief economist @entity47 said on wednesday : " we 've seen a shock that has spread to other industrialized countries faster than expected			2
it 's an important wake - up call for all of us			2
" on friday the financial world was rocked when one of the biggest @entity11 mortgage lenders @entity54 received emergency support from the @entity56			1
according to @entity11 newspaper @entity62 , " it 's further proof that the contagion of the credit crisis is spreading through the economy			1
" if the @entity10 housing slump , @entity48 warnings and @entity54 crisis are part of the economic big picture , then it 's also important to heed the calls from the coalface			2

economist @entity111 from the @entity112 believes the @entity10 housing slump and high levels of personal debt are part of the same problem : people on low incomes getting in over their heads with either housing stock or personal debt they can not afford			1
the house of cards comes down when it is time to collect : a slight upward movement in interest rates , a drop in house prices or job losses ( 4,000 in the @entity10 in the last month , a four - year high ) means payments can not be made and the lenders foreclose			2
the chickens coming home to roost for @entity138 , fellow of the @entity139 and @entity140 , high levels of callers distressed by debt are no surprise			1
" the chickens have come home to roost			2
at the personal level people have to face some very difficult decisions			2
it 's difficult to break the ( credit card ) habit and people whose habit is going to the mall will find it very hard , " he said			0
and what habits we have : more than 4.2 million @entity11 have no qualms about taking their next holiday before actually paying for the last , according to statistics from @entity11 bank @entity159			1
research from @entity161 shows one in three adults in the @entity11 refuse to plan their finances at all , and those who do find the time to review them set aside just five minutes a week			1
@entity167 on credit is a problem to be tackled not only by consumers but also governments , with our addiction to credit having a serious ripple effect on the economy			0
in the @entity10 an increase in credit card debt again pushed up outstanding @entity10 consumer debt in july by $ 7.5 billion , the @entity174 reported last monday			1
consumer credit outstanding rose to $ 2.46 trillion in july , up from a revised $ 2.45 trillion in june , the @entity174 said			0

late payments also rose , and the quarterly payment rate -- a measure of cardholders ' willingness and ability to repay their debt -- fell for the first time in over four years			1
simply put , we have developed a habit for credit cards that we ca n't afford , with people becoming adrift from old notions of delayed gratification : you save first before you purchase			0
@entity138 told @entity2 about his grandmother using both sides of an envelope before she 'd throw it out and keeping pieces of string that could later be reused			0
this @entity211 austerity is now folklore although some pundits say panic over the environment and resource use , as well an increase in personal debt may bring the war generation 's frugal habits back into vogue			1
why are we hooked on credit ? @entity222 sees a few factors responsible for our credit binge : " we 've developed retail therapy -- it 's a drug -- but it 's a very fragile plant and to build an economy based on it is ridiculous			0
" he also says the government has encouraged a people to be reckless with money through their own bad example : " the government must take much of the blame for encouraging a debt culture and saddling students early on with loans			1
" the availability of credit lines also contributes to the debt trap			1
in the @entity10 , 80 percent of households have at least one credit card			0
yet that is not enough for many credit providers			0

we use credit cards for computers , the latest gadgets such as @entity264 , holidays and fashion , all the things many of us now deem as essential			0
this readjustment of our needs -- perceiving that we now need more rather than the same or less also fuels our credit addiction			0
economist @entity111 believes our reliance on credit is symptomatic of prosperity : " it 's the by - product of the boom			1
in for example , @entity12 almost 30 percent of the population have never lived through a recession -- young people believe you can always take on debt because it 's always easy to pay off			2
prosperity is the cause of our credit addiction			2
" according to @entity138 , celebrity culture has a lot to answer for : " the credit problem is exacerbated by celebrity culture			2
it 's the ubiquity of television -- you are taught by the electronic media to envy people 's lives who are richer			0
" " with celebrity culture 150 years ago your horizon would be your parish			2
today anybody living on benefits can watch the plutocrats of the world having fun -- i 'm not surprised they are envious			0

" the bulk of callers ringing the @entity77 are juggling debts but in the future @entity138 thinks it will be harder to borrow money , due to the difficulty we 'll have in repaying it			0
when lines of credit tighten or dry up , we 'll have to readjust our spending habits and tastes			0
luxury items will once again be out of reach for most except the super-rich			0
" what 's the answer to borrowing ? " asked @entity138			0
" it 's borrow more			0
but it 's musical chairs and what 's going to happen when you ca n't sit down ? " @entity138 answers the question himself : " i think a lot of people are going to be forced out of the credit economy because they ca n't borrow and they have a black mark against their name -- similarly if you default			0
banks will start to discriminate more carefully			0
" as for our insatiable appetite to have the latest things and have them now : well it may be that if we ca n't afford them and no longer have a seemingly endless source of credit , we may have to go without			0
this in turn will tighten the screws on the retail industry			0
in @entity11 newspaper @entity352 , the " spending squeeze " was forecast with " retailers reporting falling sales as debt - laden consumers tighten their belts			1
" some experts believe it 's not spiraling debt which will be the wake up call but the environmental costs of conspicuous consumption , while @entity111 believes " a recession will trigger a change in behavior			1
the next recession wo n't be like the last one , it will cut deeper			0
