@entity0 -- most @entity2 think @entity4 justices base their rulings on personal political views rather than legal interpretation , polls show , and thursday 's ruling on the politically charged health care reform law will probably reinforce that			1
by the narrowest of margins , the high court upheld almost all of president @entity17 's signature legislative achievement : the @entity18 despised by conservatives as an expansion of government			1
the 5 - 4 decision prompted immediate criticism from the political right and the dissenting justices that it was an improper judicial overreach			0
meanwhile , the reaction on the left was jubilant , with the @entity29 executive director tweeting in exuberance : " it 's constitutional			0
" @entity32 have new rallying point with justices clearly identified as conservative or liberal , based on their rulings and the party affiliation of the presidents who nominated them , any decision on a high - profile , emotional issue such as health care reform seemed certain to exacerbate the perception of politics motivating the ruling			1
a recent @entity48 / @entity47 poll found that 55 % of respondents believed @entity4 justices would decide the health care cases based on personal or political views , compared with 32 % who said the rulings would be based on legal analysis			1
the same poll found only 13 % of respondents believed that justices generally base their decisions on legal analysis , while 76 % believed they were sometimes influenced by personal views			1
at the same time , polls show public approval of the nation 's highest court dipping near or below 50 % , which is on the low side of a rating that has exceeded 70 % in the past but is historically volatile			2
for example , a @entity1 / @entity69 poll in april showed that 50 % of respondents approved of how the @entity4 handled its job , with 41 % disapproving and 9 % offering no opinion			2
ruling cements @entity17 's political legacy to @entity76 , president of the left - leaning @entity77 , the @entity4 's role in the 2000 presidential election through the @entity81 case cemented the perception that the justices were guided by political ideology			1
" clearly the public sees the courts as similar to @entity89 -- the branch where politics trumps everything else , " @entity85 told @entity1 before the health care ruling was handed down			1
now - retired justice @entity93 warned of that very eventuality in his dissent in the @entity81 ruling , writing that although the nation may never be completely certain of who won the 2000 election , the identity of the loser was " perfectly clear			2
" " it is the nation 's confidence in the judges as an impartial guardian of the rule of law , " @entity93 wrote			0
such a dynamic may seem inevitable in an era of stark partisan divide in the country , but court watchers said it should n't be that way			0
" precisely because everything is so polarized , there should be one branch of government that people on both sides of the aisle can view as deciding on the basis of law rather than politics , because these issues are so contested , " said @entity114 , the legal affairs editor for @entity115 , in a recent interview on @entity117			2
opinion : ruling a @entity130 @entity131 , chief counsel and policy director for the right - leaning @entity133 , said on the same @entity117 program that the @entity4 " has always maintained a position of being the most revered branch of government			2
" " what you 've seen is a general decrease of public perception of government , and the court has kind of been dragged down along with it , " @entity138 added			1
in one way , thursday 's ruling altered a perception in recent years that a conservative majority on the court led by chief justice @entity150 held sway			1
this time , @entity150 joined the court 's liberal wing in the health care ruling and wrote the majority opinion , which @entity157 founder @entity156 predicted would change the public view of the court			1
@entity150 ' role in the decision " insulates the court and by extension him from criticism for the next 10 years that it 's just a partisan place that 's looking for political outcomes , " @entity156 told @entity159			2
had @entity150 sided thursday with the other four conservatives -- @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 -- the liberal reaction would surely have been as heated as the anger on the political right			0
" this is truly a turning point in @entity2 history			0
we 'll never be the same way again , " complained @entity177 rep. @entity177 of @entity178 , a leading tea party voice against the health care law			1
she called the ruling " a more far - reaching decision than anyone had expected or imagined			0
" @entity187 : are voters ready to move on ? @entity171 added to the perception of politicized justices this week in his dissent of a monday case on @entity194 's immigration law in which he , @entity169 and @entity170 opposed the majority , which included @entity150 and @entity172			1
in the dissent , @entity171 criticized the @entity17 administration 's recent policy shift to halt deportations of some young illegal immigrants and complained that the government failed to enforce immigration laws , leaving border states unprotected			0
a @entity205 editorial thursday said @entity171 's " lapses of judicial temperament " hurt the dignity of his office and endangered " not only his jurisprudential legacy but the legitimacy of the high court			1
" in recent years , 5 - 4 decisions reflected the conservative majority in some high - profile cases such as @entity217 of 2010 , which opened the electoral process to unlimited private funding without full disclosure			0
@entity150 sided with his fellow conservatives in those cases , while four justices considered to the left -- @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and the now - retired @entity93 -- supported the politically liberal stance			0
since then , @entity229 , another perceived liberal , succeeded @entity93 on the high court			1
the party affiliation of the president who nominated the justices matches the political affiliation now associated with each			2
@entity150 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 all were put forward by @entity32 , while @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity229 were nominated by @entity236			0
" the court is agreeing to hear many more controversial cases and rendering 5 - 4 rulings in these cases , which have the effect of politicizing its decision - making , " @entity85 said , adding that " with @entity217 , the inside game has become much more apparent now to many more @entity2			0
" what the ruling means to you asked if @entity81 had instigated the shift in public perception that the high court was politically motivated , @entity85 responded : " i think that 's right			1
" @entity138 , however , rejected the argument that a single ruling or set of rulings showed any particular political leaning by justices			1
@entity259 reactions follow rulings in any high - profile case , she said , noting the continued public division over the @entity264 decision in 1973 that legalized abortion			1
" the fact that a decision like @entity264 was 7 - 2 , something none of us would consider a close case ... and yet has continued to be possibly the most divisive case certainly in this last century by the court , i think that shows that it 's not all about just the vote count , " she said on the @entity117 program			2
" it 's about the public perception of whether the court is really being political or is actually deciding based on the law			1
" an even more one - sided ruling , the 9 - 0 decision on @entity282 that ended school segregation in 1954 , also prompted a public outcry , including calls to impeach then - chief justice @entity286 , @entity85 noted			0
the desegregation ruling " galvanized a base of people particularly in the @entity290 who were very opposed to that , " she said			0
she added that @entity264 led to further right - wing dissatisfaction with the high court that manifested itself in the nominations of conservative justices by @entity32 presidents @entity297 and @entity299 in the 1980s			1
opinion : the @entity4 punts more recently , major rulings have followed the 5 - 4 breakdown , including the @entity303 and @entity304 affirmative action cases in 2007 , the @entity307 gun control case in 2008 and the @entity217 case			2
shortly after the @entity217 ruling , @entity17 added to the politicizing of @entity4 issues by challenging the decision in his @entity313 as six of the nine justices sat nearby in the packed @entity89 chamber			2
" with all due deference to separation of powers , last week the @entity4 reversed a century of law that i believe will open the floodgates for special interests --- including foreign corporations --- to spend without limit in our elections , " he said to applause			0
" i do n't think @entity2 elections should be bankrolled by @entity2 's most powerful interests , or worse , by foreign entities			0
" as @entity17 spoke , @entity169 appeared to mouth the words " not true			0
" @entity138 , speaking to @entity1 before the health care rulings , questioned @entity17 's public criticism of the justices back then , saying the court 's role is to decide if " a law is within the constitutional authority of the @entity89 " and nothing more			1
" we do n't have a @entity4 to gauge which way the country 's going , " @entity138 said			0
" we have an elected legislature for that			0
" @entity114 , however , said in the @entity117 interview that " if it 's really a novel argument , and reasonable people can disagree , courts are supposed to defer to the political process and not second - guess it			0
" @entity1 's @entity352 and @entity353 contributed to this report .			0
