editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity5 ) -- " we are breaking the law , " says @entity19 , a member of local government in a small village outside of the @entity23 capital of @entity24 , " but here everyone understands this is a tradition and you ca n't change it			1
" @entity19 kidnapped his wife , @entity29 more than 10 years ago			0
he is one of the many @entity23 men who have gotten married through the @entity32 practice of bride kidnapping			1
in august , vice traveled to the @entity34 of @entity23 to investigate the origins and present - day incarnations of bride kidnapping			1
we met a family who was preparing their 18 - year - old son , @entity39 , to kidnap his desired bride @entity41 , a teenage girl from the next town over			0
@entity39 gathered his friends into an eight - seat minivan and plotted out the operation : lure the girl to the neighborhood watering hole ( an actual watering hole ) , then ambush her and drag her kicking and screaming into the van and away from her family			0
bride kidnappings happen in two basic ways : there are " consensual kidnappings , " where the two people know each other and it is a kind of role - playing , then there 's full - on , off - the - street abductions			2
unfortunately , they both look the same			0
it can be hard to tell if the girl you see crying for her mom and clawing at the faces of her abductors is merely acting out her part for her boyfriend and his family 's sake , or is actually on her way to being married against her will			0
although the tradition of bride kidnapping is illegal in @entity23 , authorities largely ignore the law			1
nearly half of all marriages in rural @entity23 are a result of the practice , with the most common justification being " tradition			1
" see the rest of @entity85 in @entity23 at @entity5 @entity86 , founder of the @entity87 , a non-governmental organization that works to abolish bride - kidnapping , argues that the practice has never been a part of @entity23 tradition			1
" the main source for @entity23 customs is the national epic , @entity95			2
but if you read the entire @entity95 , nowhere in it does the hero kidnap his wife or even reference the practice			0
actually , according to our research , we think the practice of bride kidnapping started in the 19th century and did n't become popular until the 1940s and 50s , when @entity23 was part of the @entity107			1
what i tell people when i go out to the countryside to educate them about bride kidnapping is ' it 's illegal , it 's against @entity114 , and it 's not in @entity95			1
' " not only are its historical antecedents pretty dubious , bride kidnapping has become a serious danger to the country 's women says @entity122			1
" spousal abuse is higher in kidnapped marriages , the divorce rate is higher in kidnapped marriages , and suicide rates are higher			0
" none of this seems to phase the men who have participated in this practice			2
" we are @entity23 , " says @entity19 , " it is in our blood			0

@entity5 looks at the practice of bride kidnapping in @entity138
men abduct women off the street and force them to be their wives
the tradition accounts for nearly half of all marriages in parts of @entity23
