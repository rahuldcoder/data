-- in @entity3 's trendy eastern suburbs , tattoo parlors are almost as ubiquitous as hairdressers			1
fashionable , arty and with a long list of celebrity customers , the tattooists at @entity6 -- along the hip strip on @entity9 's @entity8 -- have taken the art form a long way since blue birds of happiness and ' death before dishonor ' skull designs formed the stock in trade of parlors in the onetime port city			2
" we run it like a hair and beauty salon -- usually mondays and tuesdays are our mums and prams day , " co-owner @entity21 told the @entity22			0
while boutique tattoo parlors such as @entity6 like to highlight their family - friendly credentials , police estimate that at least one - in - four tattoo parlors across @entity32 are affiliated with outlaw motorcycle clubs such as the @entity34 , the @entity35 and the @entity36			1
this month , @entity37 passed new laws requiring tattoo parlor owners and employees to provide detailed information about their personal associations and criminal histories			1
@entity21 said the new law unfairly targets the new breed of boutique tattoo parlors			1
" it 's like we 've been tarred with the same brush , " she said			0
" if there 's a shooting somewhere it 's like , " oooh , you know , bikies , tattoos			0
" @entity55 of the @entity56 said growing gang membership is now presenting serious law and order concerns across @entity32			0
" murder to armed robbery to arson to malicious damage , firearms offences - tattoo parlors are synonymous with outlaw motorcycle gangs , " @entity55 told the @entity22			1
" predominantly the way they make their income is through the manufacturing and distribution of illegal drugs , and by having the tattoo parlors opening , they can put some of the income derived from those illegal practices and declare it as income through the tattoo parlour , which then legitimises that particular income , " he said			1
he estimates that in @entity37 alone , there are just over 2000 gang members of outlaw motorcycle clubs and that recruitment is accelerating both in @entity32 and internationally			2
besides the @entity87 , members of motorcycle clubs -- or ' bikies ' as they are known in @entity32 -- have had to contend with anti-association laws in @entity37 and @entity32			1
engaging lawyers to overturn the laws in those states , bikies are now about to fight another battle in the northern @entity94 state of @entity95 which on wednesday passed a law banning gang members from owning , operating or working in tattoo parlors			1
the suite of laws aimed at disbanding gangs named 26 criminal organisations , including the @entity103 , @entity36 and @entity104 , and banned members and associates from gathering and recruiting for new members			1
the laws also carry additional jail terms of 15 to 25 years for bikies who commit serious crimes			2
the state government , however , says it intends to go further , driving bikies out of the security , gym and second - hand car industries and even mooting a special bikies - only jail			2
@entity118 @entity117 vowed to hunt down " relentlessly " criminal gangs in the state			0
" this is not some flash in the pan or momentary phase			0
we are going to hunt you down , " he told parliament this week			0
" take off your colors , get a real job , act like decent , law - abiding human beings and become proper citizens in the state of @entity95 and you will not have to go to jail			1
" @entity94 writer and journalist @entity136 -- author of " outlaws : @entity144 " -- told @entity0 that the bikie threat was often exaggerated by state governments who found a convenient populist target in outlaw gangs			1
" almost all the states have at one time or another -- usually to distract from problems or get re-elected - elected have brought up the bikie issue up , " he said			2
" we 've seen vast amounts of money spent on task forces and crackdowns and new laws but in that period of about 10 years , the club numbers have only gone up : it 's actually attracted more young guys to the movement who figure ' well , if the cops do n't like it , there must be something good going on			0
' " you 've got a whole bunch of disaffected alienated at kids out there who see bike clubs as a cool alternative			0
" he said bikie chic in @entity32 was now so commonplace that fashion houses were releasing their own line in four - piece ' rockers ' -- the traditional leathers worn by motorcycle gang members			2
" of course , you probably would n't want to be standing next to a bikie when you went out wearing one , " he said			0
while critics , including the president of the @entity186 , @entity187 , and @entity37 director of public prosecutions , @entity189 , have derided the new laws as ' hysterical ' , bikies have been involved in some high - profile murders including beating to death a rival gang member at @entity194 in plain view of passengers in 2009			1
@entity32 's most notorious turf war between rival clubs occurred in 1984 when members of the @entity200 and the @entity103 clashed in the @entity3 suburb of @entity202			0
seven gang members and one bystander were killed in the shooting spree which eventually led to 63 murder convictions and became the catalyst for significant changes to gun laws in @entity37 .			0

@entity95 passes raft of tough new laws targetting motorcycle gangs
the laws follow similar anti-association laws in other @entity94 states
tattoo parlors have been the subject of *stringent* new laws in some states
critics say the laws are populist measures that target a high - profile group
