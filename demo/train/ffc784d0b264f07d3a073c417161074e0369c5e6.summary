@entity0 -- most @entity2 know of the @entity4 film of the @entity6 assassination -- the one and only visual recording of the killing of an @entity2 president			0
less known is another controversial recording -- this one an audio tape -- of the other @entity13 assassination , that of the president 's younger brother			1
it is the one and only sound tape of the @entity20 murder in 1968			1
sen. @entity13 was fatally shot in a @entity0 hotel while making his own bid for the @entity23 five years after president @entity6 's murder			0
that long - forgotten sound recording -- uncovered by a @entity27 senior writer and highlighted on @entity28 in 2009 -- is now at the heart of an ongoing court effort by convicted @entity20 assassin @entity31 to win a new trial or freedom			1
in their first in - depth court filing , prosecutors this month addressed the existence of the tape and a controversial analysis of it by an audio expert : the sounds of 13 shots can be counted on the tape , even though there were only eight bullets in @entity31 's sole gun , which he had no opportunity to reload			1
so , was there a second gunman involved in @entity20 's assassination ? just as the @entity52 film raised questions in some theorists ' minds about whether a second gunman was involved in @entity6 's death , the audio tape is being used as evidence in @entity31 's new legal effort to assert a second assassin was involved in @entity20 's murder			1
in documents filed this month in federal court , @entity63 attorney general @entity62 acknowledged the existence of the recording of the @entity20 shooting made by freelance reporter @entity69 , who was covering @entity13 's presidential campaign and was about 40 feet away from the hotel kitchen pantry shooting			1
acoustic expert @entity72 , featured in the @entity28 program , said his analysis of the tape concluded that at least 13 shots were fired			2
that meant a second gun had to be involved , according to his analysis			0
in her overall legal argument , @entity79 dismissed the second - gun assertion , citing " debunking " evidence			2
but @entity63 's top prosecutor was finally forced to engage the second - gun analysis , and that legal development marked a new chapter in one of @entity2 's great political tragedies -- @entity20 's death -- and the case of the man convicted of his assassination , according to @entity31 's attorneys			1
@entity20 assassin faces parole board prosecutors ' engagement of the second - gun argument was stated clearly in court papers , when the @entity63 attorney general said about @entity31 's petition : " petitioner at most has shown that , according to @entity72 , two guns could be heard firing 13 shots in an audiotape of the shooting			1
" at another point , @entity79 stated : " the mere possibility that more than one firearm was discharged during the assassination does not dismantle the prosecution 's case			0
" convicted @entity20 assassin denied parole @entity115 , a @entity116 attorney now representing @entity31 , said this month 's court filing raised public " recognition " of a second gunman now being advanced by @entity31 and his attorneys			1
mindful of a nation 's pain surrounding the @entity13 assassinations , @entity115 is careful to note he was a political supporter of @entity20 in the 1960s			2
he adds that in 1999 , he represented rev. @entity127 's family in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning @entity127 's april 4 , 1968 , murder and successfully persuaded a @entity131 , jury to find @entity132 responsible as an accomplice in the @entity127 assassination			0
@entity115 believes @entity31 was hypno - programmed to be a diversion gunman for the real assassin in @entity20 's murder			1
" what is of interest is that there now seems to be more recognition of the fact that there was a second shooter , well positioned to put three bullets into the senator from close powder burn range behind him , whilst @entity31 was always some distance in front of him , " @entity115 said in an e-mail to @entity1			2
@entity31 's insistence on the presence of a second gunman is highly controversial -- and it is questioned by some , such as legal expert @entity155 , the defense attorney who gained prominence for successfully defending @entity157 in the 1990s			1
@entity31 seeks prison release in fact , when @entity155 was in his last year of @entity159 in @entity0 in 1968 , he was at the @entity161 where @entity13 was shot			2
@entity155 had just heard @entity13 's speech after winning the @entity63 primary for the @entity165 presidential nomination , but @entity155 said he was in a room next to the pantry where @entity13 was fatally wounded and @entity155 only heard , not saw , the gunfire , he said			2
" so let 's say that there was a second gun			2
does that relieve him of any responsibility ? " @entity155 said of @entity31			0
" even if there is a second , third or fourth gun , it 's irrelevant to his claim that he 's not responsible			0
" @entity155 remembers the night of @entity13 's assassination as " horrifying and one that you 'll never forget			0
" " that 's like 44 years ago			0
i remember it vividly , " @entity155 said			0
" i think about it now when i go by there and see a school being built there , " on the site of the old @entity161			0
" it 's interesting , but conspiracy theories will come out on every single case imaginable , " he added			0
@entity155 is n't a party in the latest court action			0
in rebutting @entity31 's contentions , @entity79 criticizes the method of analysis used by the acoustic expert			1
" as reflected in @entity72 's declaration , his conclusions depend on numerous assumptions he made in recreating the shooting , such as the location of @entity69 's recorder , the make and model of the ' second ' gun , the location of this second gun during the shooting , and the number of shots fired by petitioner before he was grabbed by others , " @entity79 wrote in court papers			2
prosecutors rebut jailed @entity20 assassin 's claims in freedom quest " moreover , @entity72 's tests necessarily involved his own personal interpretation of whether impulse sounds in the recording were actually gunshots			1
in turn , there is no dispute herein that @entity72 's interpretation or opinion about the number of shots and firearms is not universally accepted by acoustics experts and that the opinions of qualified experts are available to rebut or challenge @entity72 's controversial opinions , " @entity79 said			0
@entity79 further stated that even if it could be proven " that a second gunman successfully shot senator @entity13 , ( @entity31 ) would still be guilty of the charged crimes " under @entity63 law			1
countering that , @entity31 's defense argues he was hypno - programmed to be the diversion , and that is based on a psychological examination by @entity241 , an associate clinical professor in psychology at @entity243 who has interviewed @entity31 for 60 hours over three years , @entity115 said			1
" the inescapable conclusion was that @entity31 was subject to hypno - programming which involved the use of drugs and hypnosis , " @entity115 said in an e-mail			1
" consequently , he was not in control of his actions on that night and can not be legally responsible for them			0
" i mention , as well , that @entity254 's conclusion was precisely the same as that of @entity259 ( @entity258 ) @entity257 , who extensively examined and worked with @entity31 when he was in prison right after the trial , " @entity115 said			2
@entity257 was a prison psychologist , according to court papers			0
" that these techniques were developed and used by the @entity266 over a 50 - year period was also well documented , in our brief , by professor @entity269 , the leading expert on these practices , " @entity115 wrote to @entity1			0
@entity269 , of the @entity271 , is an expert in the field of mind and behavior control			0
because @entity31 was under the mind control of conspirators , he was n't legally responsible for his actions , and he should be freed or given a new trial , his attorneys contend			0
the attorney general , however , said the psychological evaluation of @entity31 is undermined by a failure to provide " any concrete evidence ... about when , where and how ( @entity31 ) was programmed , about the identity of the ' malevolent hypnotist , ' or about how the hypnotist happened to find ( @entity31 ) as his or her ideal subject for mind control			1
" without any independent evidence that ( @entity31 ) was actually hypno - programmed against his will to write about his intention to kill senator @entity13 , to plan the murder , and to shoot senator @entity13 on june 5 , 1968 , @entity241 's opinions about the possibility of mind control are insufficient evidence of actual innocence , " @entity79 wrote			1
@entity31 and his legal team have until february 22 to file in @entity301 in @entity0 their response to the attorney general , @entity115 said			1
was there a second @entity20 shooter ?			0
