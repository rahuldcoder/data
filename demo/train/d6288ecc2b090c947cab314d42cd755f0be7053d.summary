@entity0 -- a @entity3 group tuesday expressed outrage over the slaying of an @entity7 man , allegedly at the hands of seven teenagers in what police are calling a hate crime			1
@entity13 , 37 , was stabbed to death in an attack that police say was a hate crime			1
the teens ' parents bear some of the blame , along with community leaders who have created an inhospitable environment for immigrants , @entity17 , founder of @entity18 , said at a news conference			2
" we understand that some may not welcome us in their neighborhoods , but killing us will not drive us away , " @entity17 said			2
" those that hate us allow us to cut their lawns , build their homes , paint their homes , cook for them , serve their children -- and yet they teach them hate			1
" @entity13 , 37 , was walking to a friend 's apartment in @entity39 , @entity0 , when he was attacked late saturday , police said			1
he was stabbed in the chest and died of his injuries			2
a friend walking with @entity43 was not injured			1
the seven teens were trying " to find @entity45 and to assault them , " said @entity48 police detective lt. @entity47			1

he and the other six -- @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 -- also face charges of first - degree gang assault			1
the additional charge against @entity62 stems from authorities ' belief that he was the one who stabbed @entity43			1
all of the suspects are 17 except for @entity80 , who is 16 , according to police			1
the " hate crime " designation would enhance any sentence imposed upon conviction			1
upon their arrest , all seven of the youths " admitted their involvement and their role in this crime , " said @entity48 police commissioner @entity85			1
however , all seven pleaded not guilty when they were arraigned monday in @entity95			1
@entity17 said that @entity18 and @entity43 's relatives have retained a law firm and may file suit against the youths ' families " to make sure the parents of these seven kids pay the consequences			0
" but he and other community leaders also laid blame at the feet of @entity107 , @entity48 executive			0
" he has brought this hate that exists here amongst the @entity3 community , " @entity17 said			2
" he has legislated over and over again against @entity3 immigrants			0
... he should be the person not welcome in this community			0
" the rev. @entity115 of @entity116 said , " we all know that mr. @entity107 , along with these seven young men , has blood on his hands			0
and we consider that unacceptable			0
we ask a responsible @entity121 to seek mr. @entity107 's resignation or removal from office			0
we do not need our communities to be separated by hatred , intolerance and racial discord			0
" attempts by @entity1 to contact @entity107 on tuesday were unsuccessful , as his office was closed for the @entity132 holiday			0
on sunday , however , @entity107 issued a statement saying @entity43 's death " was n't a question of any county policy or legislation ; it was a question of bad people doing horrific things , " according to @entity138 , which reported that @entity107 answered no further questions			0
in a statement issued by police sunday , @entity107 was quoted as saying , " this heinous crime that led to the death of an individual because of his race will not be tolerated in @entity48			2
the suspects will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law			0
" @entity0 gov. @entity152 , in a statement monday , also condemned @entity43 's death			0
" @entity153 tell us that mr. @entity13 and a friend were attacked late saturday by seven teenagers who were driving around looking for a @entity3 to beat up , " @entity152 said			1
" the senseless and cowardly act by these teenagers can not stand			2
... mr. @entity13 's death is a jarring reminder that we must remain vigilant and continue our fight to eradicate prejudice in our words and in our actions			1
" @entity17 said tuesday that @entity43 's death " is an outrage			0
... those days of noosing , hanging and torturing should be a thing of the past			0
" @entity62 's friends and fellow students told @entity1 affiliate wabc they do not believe he committed the crime			1
" he 's the nicest guy you will ever meet , " one said			0
attempts to contact @entity62 's defense attorney were unsuccessful tuesday			1
a candlelight vigil was held monday night in honor of @entity43			2
" i still do n't believe my brother 's death , " @entity179 said			0
