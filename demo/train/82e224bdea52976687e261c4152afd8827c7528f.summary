@entity0 -- the relationship between rock stars and royalty has not always been a cosy one			1
back in 1977 , the @entity5 stuck a grubby finger up to the silver jubilee with a raucous barge party on the @entity9			1
in 2012 , a day after a flotilla of 1,000 boats took to the same stretch of water , it seems that peace has been made			0
the diamond jubilee was marked with an entertainment extravaganza on a stage built around the @entity19 outside @entity0 's iconic @entity20			1
smoothing the marriage of music and monarchy was @entity24 's @entity25 , who curated a star - studded line - up designed to represent the best of @entity29 's 60 - year reign			1
@entity25 's friend and sometime bandmate @entity31 opened the show , performing his boisterous " @entity33 " with the trumpets and drummers of the @entity36			1
in the crowd , @entity29 guitarist @entity37 nodded approval : he 's qualified to do so , having opened 2002 's " @entity42 " playing the national anthem on the roof			1
but the real @entity43 were in the royal box , where prime minister @entity45 stood with prince @entity46 , @entity47 , princes @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 and numerous other @entity52			0
prince @entity53 , the queen 's husband , was absent , having been admitted to hospital with a bladder infection			1
@entity57 's prince @entity53 hospitalized the evening opener seemed geared more to the tastes of younger royals			2
@entity63 sang " i got ta feeling " with octave - hopping pop singer @entity65 , x-factor alumni @entity61 produced a medley of hits , while @entity25 performed a duet with a painfully out of tune @entity70			2
before long , the old guard showed the whippersnappers how it 's done			1
enter @entity75 , a man with hits in every decade of @entity29 's reign and a mega-mix to prove it			2
a closing " congratulations " was as kitsch as his powder pink suit , but @entity47 waved her @entity84 approvingly			0
monday was not all about pop though			0
classical pianist @entity86 thumped out " @entity89 , " before tenor @entity87 segued " @entity88 " into " @entity90 , " jiving on the spot for the latter in a matter unbecoming of most opera singers			0
however , the curveball of the evening was yet to come : enter the brilliant @entity96 , who took to the stage dressed like a sci - fi villainess , and spun a hula hoop for the duration of her sensual anthem " @entity103			2
" " @entity106 , our queen , " she concluded , missing the entire point of the occasion			0
meanwhile , young crooner @entity109 looked positively pedestrian in comparison , though with his shaggy red hair the people far off in the cheap seats must have wondered why prince @entity49 popped up on stage with an acoustic guitar			0
at 9 p.m. local time , the crowd stood for the queen			0
her majesty 's arrival was marked by the live debut of @entity123 's " sing , " a track written especially for the jubilee by @entity25 and @entity125			1
" hear a thousand voices shouting loud , " the syrupy lyrics commanded			0
as darkness fell , the procession of stars continued -- @entity131 performed the aptly titled " @entity138 , " while @entity132 , dressed as a @entity29 , and @entity133 whipped the crowd into a frenzy with a storming version of " @entity137			2
" by the time @entity140 appeared , the stage was beginning to resemble a @entity141 of pop music			0
the @entity144 legend sang " is n't she lovely " with lyrics re-worked for the occasion : " is n't she special , a young 86 - years old , " he crooned			2
he also played " @entity106 , " perhaps having conferred with @entity149			0
our attention was then drawn to the roof of the palace , where 80s @entity57 band @entity154 sang " @entity159 " as a light projection transformed the imposing royal residence into a row of typical @entity57 terraced houses			0
then it was back to the stage , where former @entity163 @entity162 concluded the show			1
@entity162 has provided the finale for so many star - studded galas that the image of him performing " @entity169 " as @entity133 , @entity131 and @entity75 clapped along en masse brought on a strange feeling of @entity171 vu			1
but , as ever , his humble , unifying charm made for a warm ending			0
before the majestic fireworks display and the heart - thumping national anthem , @entity25 led the @entity29 , the @entity177 and prince @entity46 on stage			2
" your majesty , @entity183 , " began prince @entity46 , as he delivered a touching speech with the right mix of levity and respect			0
the audience was treated to three hours of big names and big tunes , but -- acerbic comedians and @entity96 aside -- the @entity189 was a safe bet			1
cynics might argue that a more accurate view of modern @entity57 could come from the likes of @entity194 , whose " @entity195 " single sticks the knife into @entity45 's @entity57 , but a gig at @entity20 was never going to be the place for punk sentiment .			1
