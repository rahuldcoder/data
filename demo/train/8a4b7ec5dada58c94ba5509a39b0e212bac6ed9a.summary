-- eight months after the release of a landmark @entity5 report on human rights in @entity7 , the @entity1 is finally deliberating how to address what were described as @entity10 's crimes against humanity			1
commendably , the @entity12 is taking a leading role in drafting a resolution to respond to those crimes			0
at the same time , the @entity5 's report also tells us that @entity20 nations , both @entity12 and @entity18 , have continued to sell the @entity22 regime luxury goods in violation of several @entity25 resolutions			1
by doing so , @entity20 has effectively contributed , and still contributes , to @entity7 's heinous treatment of its population			1
the @entity28 -- citing reports that a famine that ravaged @entity7 in the mid- to late - 1990s killed between 450,000 and 2 million @entity7 -- leaves little question about the culpability for this tragedy			0
every one of those deaths was needless			0
what @entity36 , the current leader 's father , spent during the famine years -- on weapons , luxury goods and a mausoleum for @entity43 , the nation 's founder and the current leader 's grandfather -- could have fed every last one of the victims			2
the fact that a disproportionate number of those sacrificed came from the lower levels of @entity7 's political caste system adds a sinister layer to this horrific man - made disaster , in a fraternal nod to the @entity58 's malevolent axiom , " to keep you is no benefit , to destroy you is no loss			2
" what may be less known is the way @entity20 states have abetted this tale of vast human misery			0
in 2006 , too late to save the victims of the famine , a unanimous @entity25 resolution banned @entity10 from importing " luxury goods			2
" the @entity25 has since reaffirmed that sanction , and the @entity12 has duly enacted it into regulation			0
yet many @entity20 states , both @entity12 member states and nonmembers , have enforced it poorly in practice , permitting what amounts to a " do n't ask , do n't tell " trade in luxury goods for the benefit of @entity10 's elites			1
the practical effect of this " open - minded " business practice is to empower @entity22 's cronies as they purchase banned @entity20 luxury goods for the elite who help @entity22 cling to power through repression			1
in some cases , @entity7 purchased its @entity20 luxuries through intermediaries , but in many other cases , it bought them directly from @entity20 suppliers			2
for the duration of the famine , @entity95 manufacturers reportedly sold @entity36 millions of dollars ' worth of watches each year			0
meanwhile , according to @entity36 's former sushi chef , @entity22 's personal shoppers flew to @entity101 for pork and to the @entity103 for beer , and @entity36 was able to purchase luxury cars and cognac from @entity20 suppliers			1
in 2010 , according to @entity107 , @entity36 distributed 160 @entity109 sedans to his cronies			0
according to statistics released by a @entity114 lawmaker , @entity10 's luxury goods expenditures have tripled since @entity22 's succession in 2011 , to several times what the regime spent on importing food for the hungry			1
@entity120 , the former @entity121 star who has visited @entity7 several times , described @entity22 's private island and a 200 - foot yacht that is a " cross between a ferry and a @entity128 boat			1
" he reportedly added that @entity22 only served the finest liquor , just as a @entity1 survey found that 84 % of @entity7 households have poor or " borderline " food consumption			1
and last year , a reporter for @entity134 identified " @entity138 snowmobiles , @entity140 snow - blowers and @entity142 and @entity143 snow ploughs " in photographs of @entity22 's new ski resort			2
@entity95 authorities refused to allow the sale of ski lifts for the resort , a decision @entity10 denounced as a " serious human rights abuse			0
" too often , advocates of " engagement " with @entity7 have overlooked such ethical questions about what this trade has done to its people			0
in fact , the legacy of the last two decades of engagement with @entity10 increasingly resembles state capitalism -- the rich and powerful have grown richer , while denying the silent , expendable majority the means to survive by cracking down on smuggling , markets , and private agriculture			0
according to the @entity1 , @entity7 -- an industrialized , urbanized , literate society -- has one of the 10 worst cases of food insecurity in the world today , along with predominantly agrarian states in @entity171 where illiteracy hovers around 50 %			2
this state of affairs is not the consequence of lack of resources , but of @entity10 's deliberate choices			0
as commendable as the @entity12 's leadership at the @entity1 may be , it does not absolve @entity20 nations of their legal duty to improve their own enforcement of @entity1 sanctions -- or their moral duty to force @entity22 to make better decisions about how he spends @entity7 's wealth			1
@entity188 , a @entity95 group that monitors the @entity1 , recently published a call by 20 @entity7 defectors , including survivors of @entity7 's gulags , for the @entity95 government to freeze @entity22 regime bank accounts			1
@entity95 should listen to them , and @entity20 governments should gradually make those funds available for the purchase of food , provided that @entity10 permits reliable monitoring of its delivery to those in need			0
finally , @entity20 's @entity205 network , a key processor of financial transactions that recently stopped processing transactions for sanctioned @entity210 banks , should also stop processing payments for @entity1 - sanctioned @entity7 banks			1
for once , the civilized world should demand that the @entity7 state 's wealth be used to feed its enslaved and hungry people instead of its privileged and well - nourished elites .			0
