you 'd expect a conversation with @entity3 to be about music			2
he is , after all , the father of a musical genre : @entity7 - jazz			2
but when he talks about the art form , he tends to focus on its scientific merits			0
" when you start talking about jazz , they 're usually telling us that @entity15 contributed to the rhythm parts of jazz music , but it 's not only the rhythms			1
we have contributed to the science of jazz as well , " he says			0
while innovators like @entity24 may get credit for the creation of modern jazz music by using diminished scales ( as done in classical music by composers like @entity31 ) , @entity22 offers an alternative view : " in southern @entity34 , there are tribes called the @entity36 -- i call them the scientists of music			2
by cutting different size bamboos , [ they ] have been playing this diminished scale [ for centuries ]			0
so who first created it ? @entity31 , @entity24 , or the @entity36 tribes ? " unsurprisingly , i 'm not the only one who 's been presented with such questions by @entity49 , whose passion about @entity15 's contribution to music extends back to the 1960s when he went on to fuse the traditional @entity34 five - tone scales with western 12 - note harmonies to give life to a whole new music genre : the hypnotizing and eerily seductive soundscape of ethio - jazz			1
music pioneer @entity49 , whose performance saturday at @entity64 was one of the highlights of the @entity68 - based festival , has been outspoken about his country 's cultural heritage throughout his five - decade career			1
yet , the father of ethio - jazz first had to go outside @entity34 to find his musical calling			1
born in @entity76 , southwestern @entity34 , in 1943 , @entity49 was sent to @entity77 as a teenager to further his high school studies , with the goal of studying aeronautical engineering			2
it was there where his fascination with music began , after being encouraged by his teachers to pick up various musical instruments			0
@entity49 quickly discovered his natural musical talent -- and has never looked back			0
after shelving plans to study engineering , he moved to @entity68 to study classical music at @entity93			0
during those years , he also started performing live , playing congas and timpani in various clubs across the @entity68 capital			0
keen to explore jazz , @entity49 then decided to enroll at @entity100 's @entity99 , becoming the famed institution 's first @entity15 student			1
at @entity99 , @entity49 analyzed the work of jazz giants -- anyone from @entity106 and @entity107 to @entity108 and @entity109 -- but was also encouraged to explore his own musical vision			1
" i remember at @entity99 we had a fantastic teacher who always used to tell us , ' guys , be yourselves , ' " says @entity3			2
" so i started concentrating , working things out my own way and experimenting			0
" the result was a captivating musical fusion of the four pentatonic @entity34 modes with western jazz			1
" i started combining the five notes against the 12 notes , and it 's not easy , " recalls the multi-instrumentalist , who after @entity99 moved to @entity122 and recorded three albums with the @entity124			2
" it 's so difficult because it can easily lose the beauty , the character and the feel of the @entity34 modes and scales , " he continues			0
" i really had to think and work out how to combine it both and come up with something beautiful and very interesting -- that 's how @entity137 - jazz was created , in @entity122			1
" cultural ambassador by the late 1960s , @entity49 had returned to @entity34 , bringing his electrifying new sounds with him			2
at first , his radical approach was met with some resistance , especially his use of instruments like vibraphones , electric pianos , trumpets and wah wah pedals			0
yet , he eventually managed to win the hearts and minds of his co-patriots and became a leading figure in the " @entity157 " era of the late 1960s and early 1970s , when the @entity34 capital of @entity154 became famous for its experimental music scene and vibrant nightlife			0
during that period @entity49 also got to work with one of his heroes , @entity106 , escorting the great @entity162 jazz composer during his visit to @entity34 in 1973			1
" we talked about @entity34 music and the great @entity15 contribution -- especially the tribes in @entity34 , " recalls @entity49 , " and i made him listen to our great traditional music players			1
" @entity49 enjoyed a successful career in the last years of @entity171 's reign and continued making music after the @entity34 emperor got deposed in 1974 by the @entity175 military regime , which lasted until the early 1990s			1
but his big break -- at least for the wide public -- came in 2005 , when award - winning director @entity178 decided to use @entity49 's music for his bittersweet masterpiece " @entity182			1
" " @entity178 helped so much for my success , he 's a great man , " says @entity3 , recalling his first ever encounter with the @entity162 filmmaker			1
" i was playing in @entity122 and his secretary called up one afternoon and said @entity178 would love to come to your concert , " says @entity3			2
" i said ok , you 're welcome ... we met backstage after the concert and i remember him telling me , ' @entity191 i 've been a fan of your music for a long time , do you mind if i use your pieces in my film ? i said , ' great , just go ahead , there 's no problem			0
' " @entity178 used @entity49 's music as the soundtrack to the travels of @entity204 's character , and even included an @entity34 character in the story			1
the film was widely successful , and helped to introduce @entity49 's music to a large and diverse audience -- from jazz and funk enthusiasts to hip - hop and rap fans			1
several successful tours , collaborations and recordings have since followed , as well as a number of academic accolades -- in recent years @entity49 has been awarded an honorary doctorate from @entity99 , has completed a @entity220 at @entity221 and is working with @entity222 on creating modern versions of traditional @entity34 instruments			1
" sometimes i just do n't believe myself , " says @entity3			0
" i am really so surprised when i see that we play for 120,000 people in @entity227 ; in @entity228 i played twice for 140,000 people , " he continues			0
" there are some great people who created something and probably died before seeing the fruit [ of their work ]			0
but i 'm still alive , seeing my music being played all over the world			0
i 'm very happy and very pleased to see this thing happening while i 'm alive			0
