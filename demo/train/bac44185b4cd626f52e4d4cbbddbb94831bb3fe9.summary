an e-mail from a @entity2 fraternity member to his @entity4 brothers came to light this week			1
it was about how to " succeed at parties , " or more specifically " luring your rapebait			1
" it came with repulsively detailed instructions about how to scope out a target , weaken her defenses with alcohol , grab her and -- you get the idea			0
you can expect well - meaning commentators and bloggers to wonder how such a horrible man could have done such a thing , much less have gotten into a good college			0
others will wonder why one fraternity 's culture would be so toxic			1
university officials will go into damage - control mode , noting how they hold students accountable for violations of policy and that they have an otherwise low rate of rape on their campus			2
they may say , well , this was just an e-mail			2
sadly , it 's all so predictable			0
the " rapebait " e-mail could have been sent from almost any fraternity at almost any @entity39 college or university			1
a study i published in 2007 with my colleagues @entity43 and @entity45 found that fraternity men were three times more likely to commit rape than other men on college campuses			1
it was the third study showing that fraternity men are three times more likely to rape			1
opinion : we can counter " rapebait " culture the definition of " success " in the e-mail sounds eerily similar to what @entity60 identifies as rape in his research on profiling " undetected rapists " -- college men who have committed rape and / or attempted rape , an average of six times each , but are never reported and never are held accountable for their crimes			1
what was particularly remarkable about our study is that we found that it was the fraternity experience that led men to be more likely to rape			1
we traced entering freshmen from the time they got to campus through their first year of college			0
we asked them whether they committed acts of sexual violence before they got to college ( many had )			0
we then compared the rates of sexual assault among men who joined fraternities to the rates of sexual assault among men who did not join fraternities			2
in 2011 : @entity94 fraternity chapter closed over rape survey what we found was highly instructive			1
before they got to college , fraternity men were no different from other male students			1
they committed the same number of incidents of sexual assaults before college			0
but here 's the difference			0
guys who joined a fraternity then committed three times as many sexual assaults as those who did n't join			2
it is reasonable to conclude that fraternities turn men into guys more likely to rape			2
our study confirmed that fraternities provide the culture of male peer support for violence against women that permits bad attitudes to become treacherous behavior			1
and that should concern everyone			0
opinion : why do n't some boys see it as rape ? there are a lot of us across the country who have worked for decades trying to prevent rape on college campuses			2
many experience high levels of frustration at the lack of commitment on the part of colleges and universities to face the issue			2
rarely does a college discuss sexual assault with its students for more than 60 minutes in an entire college career , if they do at all			0
there are many great approaches to prevention			0
in our case at one in @entity155 , we have spent the last 20 years refining an intervention that lasts for one hour called the @entity157			0
our research , published in peer - reviewed journals , shows that when fraternity men see it , 40 % fewer sexual assault incidents occur			1
one would think that national fraternities would embrace such an approach to educating their members			0
sadly , when given numerous opportunities to do so , they prefer to pretend they are n't responsible			0
though there are a few universities that are beginning to do more comprehensive prevention programming , they are the exception			1
we know that prevention programming can help a great deal			1
we just need to make it a priority			0
how difficult is that ?			0

@entity180 says studies show fraternity men three times more likely to rape
he says frat culture gives peer support for bad behavior but education would help stem it
