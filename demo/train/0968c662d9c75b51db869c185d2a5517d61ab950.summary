-- fifty days of fighting			0
thousands of rocket attacks and airstrikes			0
and a number of failed cease - fire agreements			0
that all appeared to come to an end on tuesday , when @entity9 and @entity10 militants agreed to an open - ended truce -- and talks			1
here 's what you need to know about the @entity17 - negotiated agreement that appears to have halted the fighting between @entity9 and @entity10 militants			2
who gets what ? during the fighting , both sides have repeatedly made the same demands : @entity9 called for the demilitarization of @entity26 , and @entity10 called for an end to the @entity9 and @entity17 blockade of @entity26 -- by land , sea and air -- that began in 2007			1
as part of the negotiated truce , @entity9 has agreed to " ease " the blockade , opening border crossings to allow humanitarian aid and construction materials into @entity26 , a senior @entity17 government official with knowledge of the agreement told @entity0			1
as part of easing the blockade , @entity9 will also extend the fishing limit off the coast of @entity26 to six miles , the official said			1
both sides agree to return to @entity48 for further , indirect talks -- as @entity9 and @entity10 refuse to meet face to face			1
if the ceasefire holds , the two sides have agreed to begin talks four weeks from now on a broader range of issues , including the @entity9 release of @entity56 -- primarily @entity10 members -- arrested during the conflict and the construction of a seaport in @entity26 , according to published reports in state - run media			1
the talks will also address @entity9 's demand for the demilitarization of @entity26			1
winner ? while @entity10 spokesman @entity67 declared before a cheering crowd in @entity26 that the truce was " a day of victories for our people , " there is little sign that either side got what it wanted			1
the agreement between @entity9 and the @entity56 broke no new ground			2
in fact , the truce -- by all accounts -- looks a lot like one agreed to in 2012 to end fighting between @entity9 and @entity10 militants			1
in that agreement , @entity9 agreed to ease restrictions to allow for humanitarian aid and construction materials with an agreement to engage in talks aimed at easing economic hardships in @entity26			1
" it 's very similar			0
there is some moderate easing of the blockade of @entity26 as @entity10 and most @entity56 really wanted			2
but the big easing has been pushed off to the future , " said @entity94 , a contributing editor for the @entity95 and the @entity96			0
" and demilitarization of @entity26 , which is what @entity9 said it really wanted , has also been kicked down the road into the future			1
" according to @entity94 , who has long covered the @entity9 - @entity56 conflict : " after all this terrible , terrible bloodshed and trauma on both sides , it looks like we are back to where we were at the beginning			1
" what was the cost ? the cost can be measured in lives lost , but also in the economic and political fallout			0
more than 2,100 @entity56 were killed in the conflict			0
the @entity118 estimates that more than 70 % were civilians			0
sixty - seven @entity9 -- 64 of them soldiers -- have been killed , the @entity118 reports			2
a foreign worker in @entity9 was killed as well			2
the fighting displaced more than 500,000 palestinians , according to the @entity118 , and left thousands of homes damaged			0
it 's not exactly clear how much money the fighting cost both sides , but observers have put the number in the billions of dollars			0
given the toll the conflict has taken , there is also likely to be some kind of political fallout			0
the popularity of @entity10 has been on the decline since it took control of the @entity56 @entity138 in 2006			0
given the length and toll of this conflict , there is a question of whether @entity56 will hold @entity10 accountable for it			0
at the same time , @entity9 prime minister @entity144 's popularity took a severe hit -- going from a high of 82 % to 38 % , according to @entity147 , which cited a poll this week by @entity9 's @entity149			2
what 's next ? that depends on who 's doing the talking			0
if the ceasefire holds , and the negotiators go back to @entity48 , the fact that @entity9 and @entity10 do not talk to one another may prove problematic in trying to bring @entity9 together with @entity56 factions			1
in any talks , @entity56 are likely to include a demand that @entity17 lift its blockade of @entity26 dating back to 2007			1
@entity17 , just like @entity9 , tightened restrictions on @entity26 's borders after @entity10 won political control of @entity26 from the @entity165			0
who 's who in @entity10 @entity17 reclaims role as @entity170 ' indispensable nation with @entity26 talks @entity0 's @entity176 in @entity48 , @entity172 in @entity173 and @entity174 in @entity175 contributed to this report .			2

there is little sign that either side in the conflict got what it wanted
@entity9 agrees to ease the blockade , but not lift it , an official says
both sides agree to return to @entity48 for further , indirect talks
the truce looks a lot like the one both sides agreed to in 2012
