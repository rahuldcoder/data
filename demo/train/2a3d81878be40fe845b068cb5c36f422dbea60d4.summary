@entity0 -- @entity5 finance minister @entity4 is visiting @entity0 on thursday for the first time since @entity3 received its first bailout three years ago , hours after the @entity3 parliament voted through a bill paving the way for thousands of public sector jobs to be cut			1
his visit also comes a day ahead of a @entity13 deadline for @entity3 to meet targets before it gets its next round of bailout money			1
@entity5 , seen as the driving force behind international creditors ' insistence on austerity and reforms , has been the focus of much anger among @entity3 suffering as a result of the country 's debt crisis			2
newspaper headlines thursday reflect that sentiment			0
the newspaper @entity29 says " @entity30 , those about to die salute you , " a reference to a phrase attributed to @entity36 gladiators as they greeted their emperor			0
a headline in another paper , to @entity41 , refers to " the exterminator " and shows schaeuble about to run over civil servants on a rail track			1
while in @entity3 , @entity30 has meetings scheduled with prime minister @entity46 and finance minister @entity47			1
the measures that were voted through early thursday had to be approved in order for @entity3 to receive the latest 6.8 billion - euro slice of international bailout funds -- needed to keep the country afloat			2
the bill scraped through , with just 153 lawmakers out of the 293 present in the 300 - seat parliament voting in favor			0
there were protesters outside the parliament building late into the night while the vote was taking place			0
@entity3 police banned public gatherings and marches in much of central @entity0 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. thursday for security reasons , applying similar restrictions to those imposed during a visit by @entity5 chancellor @entity69 in october			1
but @entity3 's main opposition party , the @entity70 , @entity70 , issued a statement calling for a rally thursday evening " against the architect of the bailout austerity policies " at a square near parliament			1
in its statement , @entity70 said that " if the government is not hesitant about issuing dictatorial decisions banning gatherings , then the people must show that they have no fear for them			0
" ' better days will come ' under the new legislation , 4,000 civil servants , including teachers , could be out of work this year			1
another 25,000 will be on a " mobility scheme " by the end of the year			0
this will allow them an eight - month period to look for re-employment while receiving 75 % of their salary			0
if by the end of that period they have not found work in a different department , they could lose their job			0
a total of 15,000 are expected to be out of work by the end of 2014 to comply with the requirements of @entity3 's lenders , the @entity106 , @entity13 and @entity107 , which are asking for a slimming down of @entity3 's inflated public sector			1
but for ordinary @entity3 , who are facing unprecedented unemployment raging above 27 % , the fear is that if they lose their job , they will not be able to find another in the @entity3 market			2
only hours before the vote , @entity46 announced @entity3 's first tax cut since the crisis began nearly four years ago			1
he said @entity3 " will not relax " in its efforts , adding , " we will continue climbing up the hill , we will reach the top , which is not far , and better days will come for our people			2
" the cut in the value - added tax in the food service sector , from 23 % to 13 % , had been an issue in negotiations with @entity3 's lenders for months			1
the timing of the announcement could be seen as a signal of the government 's willingness to boost the private sector , while downsizing the bloated public service			2
many @entity3 believe the private sector has suffered a disproportionate amount during the crisis in order not to shed public sector jobs			1
on tuesday , @entity3 unions called the country 's fourth general strike of the year so far , bringing many public services to a halt			1
at least 16,000 protesters joined a peaceful march and protest held to coincide with the strike , @entity0 police said			0
@entity3 , the first country to receive a @entity13 bailout , in may 2010 , is struggling to bring its huge public debt under control			2
the country is in its sixth straight year of recession , and unemployment stood at 26.8 % as of march of this year , according to official figures			0
the jobless rate among young people in @entity3 has soared to nearly 60 %			0
journalist @entity157 reported in @entity0 , and @entity1 's @entity158 wrote in @entity159 .			0
