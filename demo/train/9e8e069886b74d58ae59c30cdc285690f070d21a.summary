@entity0 , @entity1 -- after talking about spent nuclear fuel rods at @entity0 for more than two years , it is slightly disconcerting to suddenly be a few meters from them			1
some 1,500 fuel units to be exact , rest in a cooling pool within the damaged reactor 4 building			1
@entity11 ( @entity11 ) , the crippled nuclear plant 's operator , escorted a small group of journalists including @entity2 , into the heart of the building to show us the preparations being made for an imminent and crucial operation			1
@entity11 says it will start the difficult process of removing this nuclear fuel in the coming days and transport it to a more stable location 100 meters away			1
officials say they have done this more than 1,200 times before under normal circumstances			0
but considering there was an explosion in the @entity29 building days after the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami , these are n't normal circumstances			1
" we have removed large debris ( from the pool ) and cleaned it with a water vacuum , " said plant chief @entity32			1
" but there is a possibility that very small pieces of debris were left behind			0
" if they are stuck between the channel box and the rack , we may not remove fuel smoothly , which will affect the operation 's smoothness			1
in that sense , we are concerned			0
" this would certainly be considered one of the more dangerous areas of the plant to work in			1
half a dozen men were making final checks to the newly installed crane and hook that would lift the fuel rods from the pool into specially built containers for transportation			1
all are wearing full protective gear with dosimeters in their left chest pockets to monitor their daily exposure			0
in the four hours we were on site , our dosimeters showed we were exposed to 0.06 millisieverts , the equivalent of two week 's radiation away from @entity0 , a @entity11 official told me			1
driving around the plant , evidence of the devastating tsunami is still perfectly clear two and a half years later			2
some building structures remain damaged , as steel girders lie broken and untouched			2
the cleanup operation is so immense that only essential maintenance is tackled			0
we were also escorted to the @entity77 tank area , the scene of a recent leak of contaminated water			0
the plant is home to about 1,000 storage tanks , holding the irradiated water that has been used to keep the nuclear reactors cool			2
from the 400,000 ton capacity , @entity11 says 370,000 has already been used			0
@entity87 is also continuing to try and increase the capability of the @entity90 water decontamination system , currently a fairly slow process			2
close to the ocean front , we were shown the latest efforts to stop radioactive groundwater from seeping into the @entity95 , estimated at around 300 tons a day			0
the tips of yellow and pink ribbons sticking up from the earth indicate where an underground barrier has been constructed			0
liquid cement has been injected into the ground to try and keep the water within the plant itself			0
the coming days will be crucial to the efforts to stabilize the nuclear power plant			2
@entity11 rejected alarmist comments from some quarters that any mistake in removing the spent fuel rods could spark another nuclear disaster			1
@entity32 told reporters on site , " i believe it 's nearly impossible			0
" @entity117 will tell .			0

process to remove the spent fuel is *complex* and *potentially* dangerous
