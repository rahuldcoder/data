-- more than a week into the tournament , diehard @entity2 fans are losing sleep and falling down on their jobs as they yell at their tv and computer screens			2
for those who have n't caught football fever , the enthusiasm and the sport may leave them befuddled			2
but behind the @entity2 there are stories that can speak to everyone			2
it 's a family affair when @entity18 and @entity19 face off saturday , two brothers will as well			1
for @entity22 , @entity18 defender , the match will be especially loaded			1
he 'll be playing against not just his half - brother , @entity19 's midfielder @entity25 , but also their father 's home country -- a place he 's never even visited , according to @entity30			1
the brothers have reportedly ceased contact during the @entity2 to keep their heads in the game			2
but will they hug on the field ? and who will family members , if they 're sitting in the stands , root for ? hopefully cameras will swing their direction so we can find out			0
seeking light amid the darkness of violence @entity47 love their football			0
in fact , market researchers at @entity50 determined it 's got the world 's biggest football fan base out there			1
more specifically , the firm 's study shows 83 % of @entity47 are interested in the sport and 65 % participate			1
those figures dwarf other nations , including @entity2 host @entity60 -- where 67 % are fans and 28 % play			0
so football fanatics from that @entity66 nation will certainly have a vested interest in their team 's saturday @entity2 game against @entity70			1
and given the tragedy that befell football watchers last tuesday -- when a @entity74 - backed explosion rocked a viewing center in northeastern @entity47 , killing up to 21 sports fans -- a win for @entity47 may be extra sweet			1
it 's getting hot in here the heat and humidity in @entity60 , some locations more than others , have been taking a toll on players			1
there have been complaints about it all			0
some have attributed a rash of injuries to the conditions			0
the venue in @entity95 , an @entity96 city , has been especially brutal			0
a quick online look at temps saturday show that @entity99 and @entity100 may be playing in 95 - degree ( @entity102 ) conditions			1
the good news for them , though : humidity will only be at 45 %			0
conditions for @entity18 and @entity19 , on the other hand , look like they 'll be 67 degrees with 76 % humidity ; @entity47 and @entity70 will face 86 degrees and about 61 % humidity			1
the 2022 @entity2 will be played in @entity110 , where average temps this time of year exceed 100 degrees @entity102			0
what 's in a name ? the @entity115 ( @entity115 ) may have gone home , but the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) are still in the game			1
each team in the @entity2 arrives with a nickname			1
some seem inspired : @entity122 ( @entity122 ) ; the @entity123 ( @entity124 ) ; @entity125 ( @entity126 )			0
others are less so -- though at first glance they may fool you : @entity130 ( @entity18 ) ; @entity131 ( @entity132 ) , and @entity133 ( @entity100 )			1
the translation for these three : national team			2
really ? that 's the best you 've got ? there are three games saturday			2
here 's who is up : the @entity141 and @entity142 ( @entity99 ) v. @entity133 ( @entity100 ) national team ( @entity18 ) v. @entity19 ( @entity19 ) @entity145 ( @entity47 ) v. @entity144 ( @entity70 ) 5			1
kicking politics aside the @entity2 tournament , which draws together 32 nations , puts the sport before politics			0
that mindset remains year - round for @entity152 , the @entity154 - @entity153 goalkeeping coach for team @entity100 -- which goes up against @entity99			1
he took the job in @entity100 to work with his friend and former colleague @entity157 , the football team 's head coach			1
it was a decision that went against the advice of most			0
after all , was n't @entity100 supposed to be @entity153 's enemy ? " sports is my life , " @entity152 told @entity0 's @entity163			2
" when i came to @entity100 it did n't have anything to do with political reasons			0
my personality is one of adventure and curiosity			0
i wanted to experience a culture in a part of the world i had never been to			0
" @entity100 has surprised him			0
his impressions before coming have n't matched reality			0
" when you listen to the news and you read the news , you see things			0
sometimes during commercials i step off my couch and look out of the balcony and it 's not what i am seeing , it 's not what i am reading , it 's not what i am hearing , " he told @entity163			2
" if i would 've listened to the experts , and my friends , and family , i would have never been here in @entity100			0
it 's been part of my life for three years and the memories will last a lifetime			2
" @entity60 2014 : score updates and schedule of matches @entity2 by the numbers : who 's in , who 's out ? @entity2 : wags to riches - the business of being perfect			1

@entity18 *vs.* @entity19 will pit half - brother against half - brother
it 's going to be hot on the fields , and not from any temper *flareups*
the *panoply* of team names runs from *clever* to colorful to could - use - some - creativity
