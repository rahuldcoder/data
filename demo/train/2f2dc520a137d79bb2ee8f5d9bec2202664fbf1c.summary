if you 're a business traveler in @entity1 , you 'll no doubt have complained at length about the regions ' airlines , be it the cost of a plane ticket , the quality of the food or the delays			1
it 's natural to feel hard done - by			0
if it 's any consolation , however , you 're not the only one grumbling at the unfairness of it all			0
according to the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) 2013 is expected to be another profitless year for the @entity1 airline industry			1
@entity18 , @entity16 's director general and ceo , argues that the industry is " balancing on a knife edge " with even the sturdiest and more established airlines feeling the pressure			1
you only have to look at the profits forecast for the year to see how behind we really are			0
according to the @entity28 , the sector is expected to lose $ 1.5 billion this year			0
@entity30 carriers however , are expected to fare better and post profits totalling $ 3.4 billion			0
@entity18 argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in @entity1 ; crucially , however , it can also be impacted by what he calls " onerous " @entity37 regulation and legislation			1
as an example , he cites delays : " there can be delays absolutely outside the control of the airline , but the airline still has to not only compensate the passenger but also to meet a whole lot of costs of those delays for passengers			0
" the additional costs do n't end there either : air traffic control costs are roughly double in @entity1 than they are in the @entity30			2
the costs vary on land too			0
@entity1 's economic crisis has meant some governments have increased airport operating charges			1
in an opinion piece in @entity61 's @entity60 , @entity18 argues that @entity1 airlines face " significant hurdles to sustained profitability , starting with the cost of airport and airways infrastructure			1
" @entity61 's @entity69 and @entity70 airports are a case in point : there , @entity18 says , airlines have seen a 50 % increase in charges			1
despite cutting legacy costs through mergers , consolidation and restructuring , @entity1 carriers are still facing the heavy hand of regulation and government , adds @entity18			1
" just look at what 's happening now in @entity61 with @entity86 for example ; very difficult to do the necessary restructuring in that environment "			0
@entity18 is referring to battle between @entity90 ( @entity90 ) and the @entity61 government			2
whilst @entity90 's chief executive , @entity93 , wants to cut jobs and restructure the loss - making airline , the @entity61 government is wary of a shrinking brand @entity86 , which it argues is closely associated with ' brand @entity61 '			0
speaking to me from @entity99 , @entity18 called on governments to do more to help @entity1 carriers			1
he argues they can start by helping to control cost , by adding more runways , and repelling " some of the excessively onerous consumer protection regulation			0
" in his words , to make @entity1 's airlines more competitive , government needs " to back off			2
" but in a time of great economic crisis in @entity1 , where each country is facing their own internal struggle , backing off may just be too painful for government .			2
