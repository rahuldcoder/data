-- here 's a factoid many people know but few seem to understand : @entity4 has the highest ratio of men to women in the @entity8			1
several of you tweeted and e-mailed me that data point after i published a series of stories on the fact that @entity4 also has the highest rate of reported rape in the country			1
maybe the superlatives are related ? you wondered			0
here 's a quick sample of comments i got on @entity21 : " i lived in @entity22			0
it was about 10 men to one woman per capita in the 80s , a lot of bars , partying			0
" " highest male to female ratio , too			2
needs to change male behavior there			0
" " this is because there are about 12 men to every woman			0
odds are good but the goods are odd ! i lived there , i know ! " it 's true there are more men in @entity4 than women , but the situation is n't nearly as extreme in reality as it is in the popular imagination			1
there are 107 men in @entity4 for every 100 women , according to 2013 estimates from the @entity55 ( @entity56 )			1
that 's an estimated 380,741 males and 355,658 females			0
but does it explain the high rape rate ? no way , said @entity65 , director of the @entity66			1
i invited @entity65 to a live online chat with readers about this question and others			0
" the @entity4 rates of violence against women are much higher than they are elsewhere , " he wrote			1
" the difference in the men to women ratio is n't big enough to account for the astoundingly high rates of violence that we see here in @entity4			1
" there remain some areas of the state , such as the @entity84 , where only a third of the population is female , according to a 2012 research brief to the @entity88 ( @entity89 )			0
but the statewide ratio is shrinking toward insignificance			0
" while the ratio of men to women in @entity4 is still higher than any other state in the country , it is much smaller than a hundred years ago , when men outnumbered women nearly 2Â½ to one , " the brief says			1
" the percentage of women in the population has grown over the past century , currently making up about 48 % of the state 's population			2
according to the @entity107 , women comprise 50.8 % of the national population			2
" as i detailed in my series for the @entity113 project ( more at @entity114 ) , there are a number of complicated reasons @entity4 is dangerous for women , from its long , dark winters to high rates of alcohol abuse and , perhaps more important than either , an awful history of cultural trauma and colonial violence			1
the ratio alone ca n't explain it			1
and it 's not the statistic we should be focusing on			0
@entity4 's reported rape rate is three times the national average			1
state surveys show that an estimated 37 % of women in @entity4 suffer from sexual violence -- and nearly six in 10 suffer from sexual and / or intimate partner violence , which includes threats of violence			1
the governor told me the situation is an " epidemic			0
" i 'm open to the possibility that the men - to - women ratio may affect the odds that men in @entity4 will be able to find lasting relationships			1
this has long been a favorite topic for newspaper reporters , who write about the ratio with a sort of faux - fascination			2
" there they were , " a @entity152 reporter wrote of women in a @entity155 , @entity4 , bar in 2004 , " an oasis in the @entity158 , shooting pool , giving out phone numbers , dashing off to the restroom to apply lipstick , coquettishly sipping drinks bought by their suitors , including a popular cocktail , ' @entity166 , ' made with gin and peach vodka			2
... summer is a time of hope for the unattached men of @entity155 , " the article continues , " a tough gold rush town of 3,500 people in @entity4 's far western corner , where single men outnumber single women by almost two to one			1
" in 2012 , the @entity178 sent two single female reporters to @entity4			2
" the fishermen descend almost before we even make it through the door of the rattletrap bar			0
they beg us for a game of pool , conversation , anything			0
" these reporters did n't mean any harm , and i get that @entity4 is rugged and strange			2
it really is the " @entity4 " state , a remote place where plumbing is n't a given and people fend for themselves in extreme conditions			1
@entity4 is no mecca for single ladies , though			0
instead of gawking at the ratio , we should be talking about ending the violence			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			0

@entity4 has the highest men - to - women ratio in the country
@entity207 says the ratio does n't explain high rates of violence against women
@entity4 also has the nation 's highest reported rape rate : three times the national average
@entity202 : there are 107 men for every 100 women in @entity4 ; difference is n't extreme
