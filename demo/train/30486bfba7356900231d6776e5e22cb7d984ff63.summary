-- @entity1 have toppled @entity2 from the top of the world test rankings after clinching a 2 - 0 series victory on the final day at @entity5			1
the @entity6 dominated play on day five to win by 51 runs , having won the opening match of the three - @entity11 series by an innings and 12 runs and drawn the second encounter			1
the start of the final test , which @entity2 needed to win to stay top of the rankings , was overshadowed by claims that key batsman @entity20 sent negative texts about his teammates to their @entity24 rivals			1
the former national captain , who scored 149 in the second test , was left out of the squad after refusing to sign a letter confirming he did not send the derogatory messages			2
@entity20 row overshadows battle for cricket 's number one ranking resuming on monday at 16 - 2 , the home side struggled to make any significant headway towards the 346 runs required to secure an unlikely victory and salvage the no. 1 ranking , and were 120 runs off the target with just three wickets remaining before the start of the final session			1
@entity46 and @entity47 both fell for four as @entity2 crumbled to 45 - 4 , but @entity48 and @entity49 added 89 for the fifth wicket to revive faint hopes of victory			1
@entity49 , called in to replace @entity20 , made 95 in the first innings and he again impressed with a quickfire 54 off 47 deliveries faced in his second knock before being bowled by spinner @entity58			0
@entity1 - born @entity48 was the next to go with the score on 146 as he fell to pace bowler @entity60 for the second time in the match , on this occasion succumbing to a superb diving catch at second slip by @entity65 as he posted 63 off 159 balls			1
@entity68 , another @entity2 player born in @entity1 , made a defiant 73 before being the ninth man to fall as he edged a ball from @entity71 to captain @entity72			1
@entity71 then dismissed tailender @entity73 for no score to end with figures of 5 - 30 , and seven wickets for the match			1
@entity72 dedicated the victory to @entity79 , the team 's former wicketkeeper who was forced to retire from international cricket after suffering a serious eye injury in a warmup match ahead of the series			1
" this is a message from all of us , " said @entity72 , who wore a shirt reading " we miss you @entity88			0
" " he 's been part of us for 147 games and this was meant to be his 150th			2
this victory was for him and for everything he has done for us			0
" @entity2 captain @entity98 , who was reportedly the subject of some of @entity20 's text messages , paid tribute to the tourists and acknowledged his team 's struggles in the past year since taking the no. 1 ranking from @entity107			1
" @entity1 were the better side over the course of the series and thoroughly deserved their victory , " he told reporters			1
" they were just better than us			0
i do n't look back on our time as number one with a great deal of fondness , as we had some tough times			0
" that can be a good thing , though , as test cricket tests you when you 're number one			2
we 've learned a lot and it 's a shame to hand it over , but they deserve to be number one and we will come back			0
" @entity1 will next tour @entity125 for a three - @entity11 series starting in november , while @entity2 will go to the sub-continent to take on @entity107 again			1
@entity20 's future remains in doubt , and he is unlikely to be selected for the @entity131 competition starting next month			0
after being dropped , he was dismissed for no score in a limited - overs match for his county team @entity134			2
in a bid to limit damage to his selection hopes , last week he posted a video apology on the internet and later issued a contrite statement following his omission			0
" the texts were meant as banter between close friends			0
i need to rein myself in sometimes , " he said			0
" i apologize to @entity145 and the team for the inappropriate remarks at the press conference and for the texts			0
i truly did n't mean to cause upset or tension particularly with important games at stake			0
" the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , however , has refused to say whether @entity20 will ever play for @entity2 again			2
" we are in receipt of @entity20 's apology , but further discussions need to take place to establish whether it is possible to regain the trust and mutual respect required to ensure all parties are able to focus on playing cricket and to maintain the unity of purpose that has served us so well in recent years , " said @entity153 managing director @entity154 .			2
