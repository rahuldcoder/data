-- in week five of the upcoming @entity5 season , the @entity2 champion @entity3 will play a nameless opponent			0
at least that 's what it will look like in the sports pages of the hometown @entity12 newspaper because that 's when the @entity3 travel to @entity14 to play a team whose name has become a political football			1
" it 's time to ban the use of " @entity24 , " " wrote sports editor @entity19 , who called the nickname " absurd , offensive and outdated			1
" " the most controversial name in sports wo n't appear again in the @entity12 ' print edition or on the seattletimes.com home pages as long as i am sports editor , " @entity19 announced in a thursday column			1
@entity31 's only major daily print newspaper joins a growing list of others -- such as the @entity34 and @entity35 -- that have chosen to do the same			1
others outlets such as @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 have banned the word too , though those publications are n't exactly known for the breadth of their football coverage			1
a couple of hours to the south in @entity46 , the @entity48 's other major daily -- the @entity49 -- banned the word outright in the early ' 90s			1
back then , the @entity12 was limiting its use to one mention per article and leaving it out of headlines and photo captions , according to @entity19			1
" the decision felt progressive at the time , " he said			0
" ( @entity59 ) ut now we need to go further			0
" the usage of @entity62 imagery in sports has been a long - simmering controversy			2
the @entity24 have increasingly become the primary focus of a campaign of sensitivity that has thus far failed to sway professional sports teams			1
in fact , some of the very same papers that have banned " the @entity71 " have done no such thing when it comes to the @entity62 - inspired @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77			0
is banning " @entity24 " then a double standard ? no , says @entity19			2
" some argue that if you ban @entity24 , you have to ban all other @entity62 mascots			2
i do n't agree , " he wrote			0
" ( other @entity62 nicknames ) do n't generate the same visceral reaction			0
" the collegiate level has been less reluctant to heed mounting calls for change			0
in 2005 , the @entity87 sought to end the controversy surrounding @entity62 mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed " abusive in terms of race , ethnicity or national origin " to either get @entity62 permission to use their name and likeness , or to come up with new monikers			0
opinion : is end near for @entity24 ? it 's about time patent office cancels @entity24 trademarks reclaiming the @entity62 voice			2

@entity12 becomes *latest* paper to stop using the name *''* @entity24 "
sports editor : " the most controversial name in sports wo n't appear again " in print or online editions
@entity34 , @entity35 , @entity49 do n't use the word either
