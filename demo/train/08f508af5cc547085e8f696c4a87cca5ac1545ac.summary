-- an @entity2 judge declared a mistrial in the penalty phase of the @entity6 trial thursday after a deadlocked jury said it could n't decide whether to sentence her to death for the murder of her ex-boyfriend			1
that means a new jury will be chosen , but the first - degree murder conviction still stands			2
a retrial for the penalty phase will begin on july 18 , judge @entity14 said			2
a status conference has been scheduled for june 20			0
since tuesday , jurors had been deliberating whether @entity19 , 32 , should get a death sentence for murdering ex-boyfriend @entity6 in 2008			1
a source with knowledge of the jury 's vote said there was an 8 - 4 split in favor of sentencing @entity19 to death			1
jurors refused to talk to the media and immediately left the courtroom			2
the hung jury brought to a close a dramatic chapter in a high - profile case that has lasted for months , drawing spectators who lined up for courtroom seats and waited anxiously outside the courthouse			2
but the closely watched trial is n't over yet			0
in many states , the death penalty would be off the table if the jury could n't agree			2
" it 's a very unusual circumstance , but it is part of @entity2 statute that yes , if you get to this third phase , the penalty phase , and there is a hung jury , it means another jury comes in , " said @entity0 's @entity45 , who has covered the @entity19 trial from the outset			1
in a written statement , @entity58 attorney @entity57 said prosecutors " will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase			2
" " we appreciate the jury 's work in the guilt and aggravation phases of the trial and now we will assess , based upon available information , what the next steps will be , " he said			2
legal experts debate what 's next speculation surged that prosecutors might consider offering @entity19 a plea deal rather than going through the lengthy steps necessary to find new jurors and present evidence to them			1
" i do n't think by any means that this is a sure thing you retry the penalty phase , " said @entity79 , a criminal defense attorney			0
a lot depends , he said , on exactly how many jurors were willing to go with the death penalty this time around			1
" if it was 11 to 1 ... for death , you can be sure the prosecutor is going to want a retrial			2
if it tilted the other way ... they may just decide , ' no , we 're not going to do that , we 'll try and cut a deal , ' " he said			2
another key step for prosecutors will be speaking with @entity102 's family to decide whether to proceed , @entity0 legal analyst @entity98 said			1
" the prosecutors have to speak to the family , because we know this family has been in the courtroom day in and day out			1
they were visibly shaken and upset when this hung jury came back , " she said			0
" and so there 's no question in my mind that it 's premature to say this will , indeed , go to another penalty phase			2
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity115 said that prosecutors have little motivation to agree to a plea deal that offers @entity19 a life sentence			1
if the prosecution won in a retrial , he said , @entity19 would receive the death penalty			1
but even if they lost , she would probably get " the same life sentence she would obtain in a negotiated deal , " he said			2
" the only real roadblock to a penalty retrial would be the strong request of the victim 's family to accept to a plea and end the process now , " he said			1
" i think such a request unlikely			0
" emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury 's inability to agree on a sentence was announced			2
@entity19 appeared to be on the verge of tears			1
one of @entity102 's sisters sobbed			0
even the normally stoic judge 's voice cracked as she dismissed jurors			1
" ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the participants in this trial , i wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community , " she told them			0
" this was not your typical trial			0
you were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities			0
" an alternate juror and a juror who was on the panel cried as the verdict was being read			1
as the jury filed out of the courtroom , one juror said , " i 'm sorry " to @entity102 's family			1
jurors struggle to agree jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they would n't be able to agree on a verdict			1
earlier this month , the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that @entity19 was " exceptionally cruel " when she stabbed @entity6 29 times , slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face			1
they pronounced her guilty of first - degree murder on may 8 after 15 hours of deliberations			1
for @entity19 to be sentenced to death , a jury 's decision must be unanimous			1
about an hour into its deliberations on thursday , the jury sent out a question , but the details of its query were not revealed in court			0
on wednesday morning , the jury sent out a note saying its members could n't agree			0
@entity14 told them to try again and ordered them back into the jury room			0
if @entity19 is given a sentence of death , she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of @entity2			1
have n't been following the trial ? read this a plea for mercy on tuesday , @entity19 pleaded with jurors to spare her			1
she told them she would dedicate her time in prison to performing acts of charity from behind bars			0
she said she would teach people to read or to speak @entity213 , start a book club and donate her hair so it could be used to make wigs for sick children			0
she showed jurors several pieces of her artwork			0
she called @entity102 's murder " the worst mistake " she had ever made , " the worst thing i 've ever done			0
" she could n't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime , @entity19 told the jury			1
" but i know that i was , " she said			0
" and for that i 'm going to be sorry for the rest of my life -- probably longer			0
" a case packed with twists and turns @entity19 was living in @entity231 , @entity232 , when she met @entity102 at a business convention in @entity234 in september 2006			1
that november , he baptized @entity19 into the @entity237 faith , a ceremony @entity19 said was followed by anal sex			1
@entity19 became his girlfriend two months later , she testified			2
they broke up in the summer of 2007 , and @entity102 began dating other women			0
in june 2008 , @entity102 missed two appointments , prompting friends to go to his house			0
they found his naked body crammed in a stand - up shower he had been stabbed 29 times in the back and torso and shot in the head			0
after her arrest , @entity19 told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into @entity102 's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped			1
relatives who spoke with police described her as mentally unstable			0
the trial , which started in january , has been rife with sex , lies and digital images -- among them graphic autopsy photos that showed @entity102 's body			0
now , if the trial continues , some of the same gruesome details of his slaying may be presented again in court			0
" because in order for a jury to actually impose the death penalty , they really need to see the cruelty , " criminal defense attorney @entity274 told @entity275			0
" and they really need to understand the motives behind this murder and what great lengths she went to -- to actually cover this up			0
" @entity286 : friend of @entity19 tweeting on her behalf @entity0 's @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 , @entity275 's @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 and in @entity295 's @entity294 contributed to this report .			1
