@entity0 is back in her tiny hometown in @entity3 with family members monday			1
they are doing everything they can to make the 7 - year - old feel safe and loved -- a simple but critical act that mental health experts say can help the child begin grappling with being the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed her parents , sister and cousin			1
family members will raise sailor , and money from a family - sanctioned online fund will help , said @entity0 family spokesman @entity22 , an attorney who personally knows the family			1
but out of concern for the girl 's healing , @entity22 said there will be no more details released about her			2
" our total focus is protecting her , " he said			2
sailor 's father was a longtime pilot , @entity22 said , and his children flew with him many times			1
on friday , a @entity36 that was carrying the family went down in western @entity38			2
even though the aircraft was upside down , @entity34 managed to make it out and walk three - quarters of a mile in the dark through very rough terrain , across fallen trees and ditches			1
she navigated around creeks and over blackberry briars despite wearing only one sock , a t - shirt and shorts , and no coat			2
mother remembers last moments with daughter lost in @entity38 plane crash she knocked on @entity56 ' door			2
" she said , ' my mom and dad are dead			2
we had a plane crash			2
the plane was upside down			2
' " on @entity1 monday , @entity56 said the girls ' legs were cut and scratched from the bottom of her shorts to the tips of her toes			2
she was a little wet because it was drizzling			2
@entity56 put her on his couch and called 911 , alerting authorities that a plane had gone down and there was at least one survivor			2
@entity56 said his two @entity77 helped calm the girl down			0
the child 's grandfather later told him that she had a dachshund			1
" i know she 's having an extremely hard time and probably in her mind she does n't understand everything that 's going on , " said @entity56			1
though she was trembling and crying , the little girl seemed " amazingly composed , " he said , given the circumstances			0
grief in a child 's mind children who experience the sudden loss of a family member process that grief in ways that are specific to their age , say mental health specialists who treat young patients			1
losing one relative elicits complex feelings ; losing several relatives , particularly parents , is uniquely overwhelming			0
on top of her grief , @entity34 will also have to grapple with the trauma she endured being part of the event that killed them			0
" it 's critical that @entity34 feel safe and loved -- that has to happen right away , " said dr. j. @entity110 , a psychologist who has treated grieving children and co-directed @entity113 's seminal study on childhood bereavement			1
the @entity0 family is not saying where the child is living , and that 's a very good move , @entity110 said			1
journalists camping outside her door could scare and traumatize her , he said			0
other mental health experts who specialize in treating children advise that the family try to keep as normal a routine as possible			1
they must keep in mind that grief is a process			0
it 's not a problem to be fixed			0
there 's no rush , they say , for her to see a counselor			0
and it could be damaging for an interviewer without training in child trauma to question her now , said dr. @entity144 , a professor emeritus of psychology at @entity146			1
he has treated children after disasters			0
" if they called me , i would n't say , ' send her to my office			1
' i 'd go to her home and we 'd just sit down			0
i would be a friend			0
she ca n't feel threatened in any way , " he said			1
let the child lead sailor should be allowed to provide cues as to how adults behave around her			1
" if she wants to talk about what happened , let her			1
if she does n't , then let her be for a little while , " @entity110 said			1
" when you have too many losses in too short a period of time , in children , their grieving process can shut down			0
" sometimes , children develop somatic symptoms in place of grieving			0
@entity177 children act out because they do n't have the developmental tools yet to articulate how they feel			1
older children and teenagers sometimes get headaches , stomachaches or anxiety disorders , he said			0
each of @entity34 's relatives ' deaths should be addressed separately , experts advise			1
the way @entity34 will process the loss of her sister is apart from the way she will grieve for her mother			0
@entity34 will deal with those losses differently as she gets older			0
she will feel them differently from the way she felt them at ages 12 , 18 and 25 , said dr. @entity198 of @entity199 in @entity200			1
a 7 - year - old generally understands what death is but does n't yet have the ability to comprehend the implications of it , experts say			1
a common coping mechanism at that age is denial , said @entity198			0
the adult world is stunned and impressed that @entity34 managed to get up from the wreckage site , walk in the dark , in frigid temperatures , across a rough , wooded area to get to a man 's house , knock on the door , tell that stranger what happened and ask for help			0
but that action should n't be interpreted as a sign that @entity34 is somehow more capable of recovering than any other child who faces such a horrific tragedy			1
" she may have acted amazingly composed , " said @entity198			0
" but what might be happening on the outside is n't necessarily what 's happening on the inside			1
she will have to deal with this trauma in a way that unfolds over a lot of time			0
she will have to work this for the rest of her life			0
" still , @entity236 , who survived a small plane crash himself in 1998 , encouraged sailor to draw on that same strength she showed after the crash as she faces a challenging healing process			2
" if you ever question if you can do it , look back at what you did -- you were able to get out of a plane , you were able to walk three - quarters of a mile in the dark , by yourself and find safety			0
you can do it , no matter what			0
" i was the sole survivor : 4 stories of plane crash survival			0

adults around @entity0 should allow her to give cues ; if she wants to talk , she will , mental health experts say
*therapist* : a child of 7 understands what death is but does n't have the tools to comprehend its implications
the most *important* thing adults around sailor should do immediately : make her feel safe and loved
