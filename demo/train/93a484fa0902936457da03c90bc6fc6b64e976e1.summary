@entity0 , @entity1 -- a local court has set free a teenage boy after finding him guilty of stealing a policeman 's sandals in a case that caused furor among @entity1 frustrated with perceived injustices against the poor and defenseless			1
the 15 - year - old could have spent five years in jail for the alleged offense			0
he is accused of stealing the sandals from a boarding house where the cop was staying in november 2010 but was brought to trial only last month			1
@entity1 's @entity18 decried the verdict on wednesday , noting that the sandals presented as evidence in the court did not belong to the policeman , a fact he affirmed in court			1
the @entity18 's secretary , @entity29 , said in a statement to @entity2 , " this verdict is controversial and it hurts people 's hearts			1
the court could not prove it , but they still gave him a guilty verdict			1
to be on the safe side , the boy was returned to his parents			2
but the verdict will be a life - long scar on the boy because he will always be considered a sandal thief			1
" the judge took a safe stand between pressure between two sides , pressure from the police and prosecutor , and pressure from the public and the media			0
this is a country with a thousand faces , " the commission said			2
to protest the charges against the boy , a campaign to gather a thousand flip - flops began on december 28			1
students , teachers , construction workers , public transport drivers and lawyers among others dropped off pairs of sandals at centers set up around the country			2
" two high school students came here , took off the sandals they were wearing and walked home barefoot , " said @entity68 , of the non-governmental organization @entity69 and who helped start the campaign after hearing about the case			1
" we came up with the idea of a thousand sandals which we see as being the symbol of resistance also as compensation for the sandals that was allegedly stolen , " @entity68 said			2
the sandals were intended for the policeman who lost his pair " so he does n't have to buy another pair for the rest of his life , " @entity68 added			1
about 1,300 pairs of used and brand new sandals were collected , as calls to donate spread through @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			1
organizers had earlier said the campaign would end only when the boy was acquitted			1
to express disappointment over the verdict , the sandals would be given to different government institutions instead , @entity68 said on thursday -- namely the national police , the attorney general 's office , the @entity100 , the @entity101 and juvenile detention centers			1
the boy 's parents are also considering an appeal , he added			1
before wednesday 's verdict , national police spokesman col. @entity111 told @entity2 it had been the boy 's parents who wanted to bring the case to trial			1
" in this situation , the advice from the police was for the parents to give their son more attention and guidance , but this was n't accepted by the parents , and they wanted the legal action to be taken			0
" the @entity18 , however , said the parents had filed a complaint with the @entity130 police after the alleged victim , 1st @entity132			1
@entity133 , and another colleague interrogated the boy			0
the parents allege the policemen beat up the boy and forced him to admit to the theft			2
the parents , according to the commission , wanted a case filed against those policemen			0
both were given disciplinary action , said @entity146 , the national police spokesman			0
according to @entity148 , the police should have prioritized intervention and rehabilitation since the alleged offender is a minor			0
there have been numerous cases of minors brought to court over petty crimes			0
last year a 12 year - old - boy was tried and later acquitted for allegedly stealing loudspeakers from a mosque in @entity160			0
another 14 - year - old was detained and charged for allegedly stealing a cell phone top up card worth $ 1.50			0
according to the @entity18 , in 2011 alone , 6,273 minors were reported to be serving time in jail , some of them in adult prisons			2
the goal is to get all juveniles out of prison and change the laws governing minor offenders , @entity29 said			0
a bill on the protection of children 's rights is under deliberation and expected to pass this year in parliament			0
" the commission is pushing to abolish juvenile punishment in @entity1			1
we hope it will be included in the bill			0
it means that first the child needs to be returned to their parents for guidance , then given training and education , and the harshest would be rehabilitation with the right intervention			0
we 're not asking that more juvenile facilities be built			0
we do n't want minors in jail , " @entity29 explained			0
this also is not the first time @entity1 have rallied around a victim of perceived injustice			2
public pressure from a similar campaign in 2009 , " coins for @entity204 , " helped a housewife escape criminal liability for complaining in a private e-mail about a hospital 's service .			2

commission notes that sandals presented in court were not policeman 's
campaign kicked off last month to donate sandals in protest
they were meant for policeman who accused boy of theft
