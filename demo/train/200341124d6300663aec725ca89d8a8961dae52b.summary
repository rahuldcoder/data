i was on the phone with a friend in his junior year at my alma mater , @entity5 , discussing his campus work and future goals , when his roommates relayed the news and he stopped , suddenly , and said : " @entity10 and his wife were shot			1
" a ping of utter shock struck			2
thinking i must have misheard , i asked , " you 're kidding , right ? " of course , i would never think that my friend or anyone else i know would make light of such a thing , but it was too heavy a loss to swallow so quickly			2
in the minutes and hours that followed , i learned of the full magnitude of the situation			2
@entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 , three beacons of light and honor in our communities , had each been shot in the head in their apartment , and died			1
it is difficult to put into words the rush of emotions that we all felt last night , and that continue to fill our hearts and bring pain to our souls			2
we lost so much in a matter of minutes			0
these three young @entity47 were active in their neighborhoods and communities , worked with local and international charities and relief efforts , supported their brothers and sisters in the @entity54 in their educational and professional pursuits , promoted love , tolerance and togetherness			0
they laughed with us , shared in others ' pains and sorrows , offered relief , and put their actions where their words so constantly were : striving for a better , more just and more caring world			0
in the hours that followed , as police arrived on the scene and began their investigation , family and friends gathered in the clubhouse of the apartment complex , grieving , praying with one another and offering comfort to the parents and siblings of our fallen			0
deah and @entity28 were barely six weeks married , a story of love , respect and support that warmed all our hearts			1
@entity29 , @entity28 's younger sister , was visiting her big sister and brother - in - law when they were killed			1
police said their neighbor , @entity91 , came into their home and shot them			1
i can not imagine the sweltering hatred and utter disregard for human life that must have plagued the killer 's heart and soul , but all must know and honor the kinds of people @entity80 , @entity28 and @entity29 were to understand how terribly they will be missed			1
a second year dental student at @entity104 and a community youth leader , @entity80 was the only one of the three i had met			0
he was an awe - inspiring model of all the absolute best attributes of humanity , and i am blessed to have known him			2
@entity28 and @entity111 , though i never had the great honor of meeting either personally , radiated the most wonderful and captivating aura as i have ever seen			1
they were beloved by all who knew them , and they all made us better people , better friends , better brothers and sisters to our siblings , better children to our parents , better citizens and better @entity125			1
for them , and for all of us , our @entity126 is our guiding light , our motivation , the lens through which we see the world and our places in it			0
our @entity126 -- @entity80 , @entity28 and @entity111 's @entity126 -- is the @entity126 of grassroots organizing , giving and promoting charity work , treating everyone with only the best manners and a smile , always a smile			1
our @entity126 tells us to do what @entity141 @entity140 said and did , to " honor thy neighbor as thyself			0
" these three did this every single day			0
our @entity126 tells us to do what @entity147 said and did , to confront hate and evil with love and kindness			0
@entity80 , @entity28 and @entity29 transformed this mantra into their lives ' work and passion , and lifted us all up in the process			1
they say you may not remember what a person says , but you will always remember how they made you feel			0
well , these three made everyone they ever met feel cherished , valuable , empowered and loved			0
my prayers and those of my family and friends are for their souls ' everlasting peace and rest , for patience and strength to their families and loved ones to endure this tragedy , and for the @entity180 consciousness we all need to carry on after such devastating loss .			2
