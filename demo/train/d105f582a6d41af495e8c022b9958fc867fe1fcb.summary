it 's become another military euphemism , along with " collateral damage " and " friendly fire			1
" the " knock on the roof " is the @entity6 military 's warning for civilians before it fires on a building and is being used extensively as @entity6 airstrikes target @entity11 sites in @entity12			1
the @entity6 @entity15 developed the technique in 2009 as a way to warn civilians in @entity19 to leave buildings it has identified as locations where @entity11 keeps ammunition , a rocket stash or command post			1
but it is a controversial policy that has been criticized by human rights groups			1
the procedure generally begins with a phone call to the occupants to leave a building , according to @entity32 , a retired brigadier general in the @entity34 ( @entity34 ) and a former fighter pilot			1
such places , he says , are often under constant surveillance , and the @entity34 has a sense of how many people live there , and how many leave			2
if it is still unclear whether a building is occupied , a missile that carries little or no explosive load is aimed at the roof of a building			1
the impact is felt , but it rarely causes casualties			2
" it 's meant to get people to take us seriously , " says @entity32			1
there is no standard gap between the delivery of the " dummy " missile and fully armed missiles , says @entity32			2
it can be minutes or even hours			0
it depends on how important the target is			0
but there are hundreds or even thousands of such places in @entity19 , chosen by @entity11 precisely because they complicate targeting			1
one dramatic example of the " knock on the roof " appeared on social media sunday			1
distributed by the @entity19 - based @entity69 news agency , it showed at first the impact of an unarmed rocket or missile on the roof of a house			1
@entity75 rose from the roof ; curtains billowed from an open window			2
some time later -- @entity79 says about 15 minutes -- two missiles slammed into the building , blowing out the facade and sending debris and thick smoke across a wide area			0
it 's not clear whether the occupants of the house had heeded the warning -- it may have been empty -- but no one was hurt			2
but human rights groups have condemned the technique -- despite the precautions			1
what you need to know about the country of @entity6 a warning or an attack ? " in some but not all cases , families receive telephone calls from the @entity6 military in advance , " said @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 at @entity102			1
" there is no way that firing a missile at a civilian home can constitute an effective ' warning			0
' @entity102 has documented cases of civilians killed or injured by such missiles in previous @entity6 military operations on the @entity19 , " he said			1
human rights groups in @entity19 agree			1
" the sending of a missile can not be considered a warning			0
it is the targeting of civilians with a weapon , regardless of how small , and it is a violation of the @entity126 , " said @entity121 of the @entity122			2
" imagine you are in @entity19 and there are airstrikes everywhere , and many families are in the bottom floor of their home , " @entity121 added			1
" families miss the sound of the ' warning ' missile because it sounds like just another explosion			0
" @entity138 's @entity137 , reporting from @entity139 friday , visited one targeted house whose residents said no warning had been received			2
at another property that was also destroyed , a warning had been received			0
but the man living next door , @entity145 , told @entity138 he did n't get any warning -- and now half of his house is also in ruins			0
" when i heard there was danger , we ran away with my family			0
we have no bomb shelters , we have nothing			0
all we can do is escape , " @entity145 said			0
it 's not clear whether any warning was delivered by any means to the home of @entity19 's police chief , @entity162 , on saturday night			1
the missiles that hit his house killed 18 members of his extended family , including six children			2
when @entity137 and his team visited the ruins of the compound monday , they found what appeared to be the reason it was targeted : evidence of reinforced tunnels			0
@entity32 says the precision of such attacks has improved as crews have gained experience			0
" the number of strikes has more than doubled compared to @entity184 ( the 2012 conflict ) , but the number of casualties is about the same , " he said			0
dense area , deadly damage but even in an era of precision targeting , the impact of missiles ca n't be restricted to one house in such a densely - populated area			0
many of those injured in the strike on the @entity198 were hit by shrapnel as they left an adjacent mosque			2
in other instances , people have gathered only a short distance from a building designated for attack -- not far enough away from flying concrete , wood and metal			0
and the @entity209 says some 70 % of those killed in the current conflict have been civilians and there has been at least one deadly miscalculation			1
on july 8 , eight civilians -- all members of the @entity217 family -- were killed when their home in @entity219 was hit			1
according to the @entity34 , the family left the house after a phone warning but had returned home prematurely after a " knock on the roof			1
" perhaps they mistook it for the explosive missile			0
the property had been targeted because it belonged to @entity217 , a senior official with the @entity230			0
a senior air force officer told the @entity6 newspaper @entity232 that it was too late to prevent the airstrike that followed the warning			1
" there was nothing to be done , the munition was in the air and could not be diverted , " he said			0
some in @entity19 have even put themselves in harm 's way			1
ten people were killed july 9 when they formed a human shield on the roof of another property belonging to the @entity217 family , according to @entity248 medical and security sources			1
the " knock on the roof " technique was first used in the 2009 conflict in @entity19			1
but it was criticized by the @entity209 - appointed @entity253 that investigated the conduct of both sides in that fighting			2
the commission said it was " not effective as a warning and constitutes a form of attack against the civilians inhabiting the building			2
" " the fact that a warning was issued does not relieve a commander and his subordinates of taking all other feasible measures to distinguish between civilians and combatants , " the commission 's report said			1
@entity272 : a smart way out of the @entity19 confrontation phone calls and leaflets the @entity6 military also uses telephone messages and leaflets to warn people in @entity19 to leave neighborhoods where their forces intend to target alleged @entity11 facilities			1
on saturday , the air force dropped thousands of leaflets across several neighborhoods in northern @entity19 , warning people to leave their homes ahead of military operations against @entity11 targets			1
" whoever does not adhere to these instructions and does not vacate their house immediately is subjecting their lives and the lives of their children and family to danger , " it read			0
in past campaigns against @entity11 , the @entity6 military has also commandeered television and radio signals to issue warnings			1
leaflets and phone messages were used in the 2008 - 09 and 2012 conflicts			2
they were partly political ; blaming @entity11 for the violence , and partly an attempt to clear areas where @entity6 forces intended to focus strikes			1
during both conflicts , leaflets were dropped warning people not to come within 300 meters of the border			0
in 2012 , leaflets warned residents that terrorist organizations were hiding among them and represented a direct threat to their lives			0
in 2008 - 09 , according to an @entity34 report , some 2.5 million leaflets were dropped			0
one warned that " anyone having ammunition and / or weapons in his home is risking his life and must leave the place for the safety of his own life and that of his family			0
" the same message was delivered in some 165,000 phone messages			2
the @entity253 acknowledged " significant efforts made by @entity6 " in 2008 - 09 to alert @entity19 residents to planned attacks , but said " the lack of specificity and thus credibility " of some of these messages had diminished their value			1
the leaflets can also have the effect of worsening an already difficult humanitarian situation			0
as people leave their homes in the current fighting , thousands end up in the care of the @entity355 , in crowded schools			2
they must leave their livelihoods behind			0
others say they have nowhere to go			0
" these are more threats than warnings , " says @entity121 of the @entity359			0
" telling 150,000 people to leave their homes when there are airstrikes all along the route and nowhere to go because every home in every place is a target			0
" @entity145 in @entity139 tells @entity138 , " there 's no escape			2
" " @entity371 has sealed our fate , whether we stay or leave			0
" cease - fire effort collapses as rockets , airstrikes continue running from death in @entity6 , waiting for it to come in @entity19 trapped in war : ' this is tyranny '			1

@entity6 's military tries to warn civilians in @entity19 ahead of a strike
sometimes a phone call precedes the " knock on the roof "
still , human rights groups say , civilians are being killed in the fighting
