forum as leader of the world 's second largest economy			0
usually the @entity5 makes the running at the annual @entity8 get - together of @entity2 , the @entity5 , @entity14 , @entity15 and 17 other @entity17 economies that between them account for half the world 's output , 45 % of its trade and 3 billion of its inhabitants			1
but @entity5 president @entity24 's decision to pull out of the @entity8 forum and leaders ' retreat in @entity28 , @entity29 this week because of a domestic political brawl leaves @entity1 and @entity14 president @entity31 as the two most powerful men in attendance			1
@entity5 secretary of state @entity34 now leads the @entity5 delegation to @entity29 for @entity8 and to the @entity37 and @entity5 - @entity39 meetings that follow in @entity40 starting wednesday			2
@entity24 's cancellation was no surprise			1
he had already trimmed @entity43 and the @entity44 from his @entity46 itinerary because of the failure of the @entity48 to pass a new budget			0
the possibility that the @entity5 government shutdown could escalate into the almost - unthinkable disaster of a debt default later this month prompted him to drop the visit entirely			0
as @entity24 warned the world in remarks in @entity57 , @entity58 thursday , " as reckless as a government shutdown is , ... an economic shutdown that results from default would be dramatically worse			0
" @entity24 's comments have been dismissed by his @entity65 opponents as scare tactics , but the world economy can do without this sort of drama			2
as @entity31 said after the @entity72 summit in @entity73 , @entity14 , last month , the global economy is doing better than it was five years ago , " but the risks are still very high			2
" @entity24 was scheduled to speak monday , the last day of the @entity8 forum before the leaders ' retreat on tuesday , on a theme that now seems particularly pertinent -- " @entity5 's leadership and priorities : what they mean for the world			1
" @entity24 's 2010 " pivot to @entity46 " policy was supposed to enmesh the @entity5 ever more deeply into the region , as a counterweight to the rapidly growing influence of @entity2			1
but he cancelled trips to @entity46 in 2010 because of domestic pressures , and in 2012 declined an invitation to attend the @entity8 forum in @entity93 because of the timing of the @entity96 convention			2
his cancellation statement on thursday showed his frustration at another domestic issue getting in the way of his @entity17 aspirations : " this completely avoidable shutdown is setting back our ability to create jobs through promotion of @entity5 exports and advance @entity5 leadership and interests in the largest emerging region in the world			0
" @entity24 's withdrawal is a gift for @entity31 and @entity114 , who was scheduled to follow @entity24 on the @entity8 speaking agenda , has as his conversation theme the evocative " taking another look at the @entity17 : where are the new opportunities for growth ? " @entity1 is @entity8 's final speaker and will deliver a keynote address entitled " @entity2 in transition : what can the @entity17 expect ? " @entity2 's economy may have slowed a little in 2013 and its structural employment , environmental and social issues present big challenges ahead , but it remains very much the regional engine of growth and its @entity46 neighbors know their prosperity is intimately linked to what happens in @entity2			1
the @entity5 , of course , has enormous commercial advantages as a consequence of its recent shale gas energy revolution , but the current political impasse is putting stress on its reputation , and a debt default -- however unlikely it may be -- would be an enormous setback			0
with @entity24 out of the @entity8 picture , @entity34 is doing the heavy lifting in discussions with @entity1 , @entity31 and other key leaders such as @entity15 prime minister @entity148 and @entity29 host president @entity149			1
in particular , @entity34 is pushing the @entity151 ( @entity151 ) trade negotiations that have the ultimate objective of creating a free trade pact for @entity17 nations			0
twelve countries are in the @entity151 talks -- @entity158 , @entity40 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity15 ( which entered in july this year ) , @entity43 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , the @entity5 and @entity165			0
although some observers see the @entity151 as an @entity5 - promoted exclusionary device aimed at @entity2 , @entity1 has already welcomed the " mushrooming " of regional free trade agreements ( @entity171 ) as a " positive sign			1
" in remarks released by his office last week , @entity1 referred to a @entity2 saying , " the ocean is vast because it admits hundreds of rivers , " and said @entity2 supported the process of @entity17 economic integration with an " open attitude			2
" but , he said , " at the same time , we believe that in developing @entity182 , the parties should cherish the principles of openness , inclusiveness and transparency and , in particular , demonstrate flexibility for economies at different development stages , so as to offer more options for integration			0
" there is an expectation on the @entity2 side that it will be a @entity151 member within three or four years , though issues such as restrictions on internet access remain a potential stumbling block			0
when @entity1 and @entity24 met on the sidelines of the @entity72 summit in @entity73 last month , the focus was on @entity203 , greenhouse gases , global economic growth , job creation and investment			2
in part , it was a continuation of their informal discussions in @entity212 in june this year , when @entity1 made it clear that he wanted to work with @entity24 on building what he called a " new model of a major country relationship			0
" for @entity1 , @entity8 would have been another opportunity to talk to @entity24 about rebalancing the @entity5 - @entity2 relationship , to give due weight to what @entity1 regards as @entity2 's role as a world power not just economically , but in strategic terms as well			1
instead , he has more time this week to talk with @entity31 about the growing @entity2 - @entity14 relationship and with other @entity17 leaders on regional free trade agreements , economic integration , expanded investment co-operation and sustainable long - term growth .			1

@entity2 president @entity1 and @entity14 president @entity31 speak at @entity8 monday
@entity5 president @entity24 canceled his trip to @entity46 to deal with the @entity5 shutdown
comes as @entity5 trying to pivot foreign policy strategy to be a bigger *player* in @entity46
@entity238 : @entity24 's withdrawal is a gift for @entity31 and @entity1 , as they steal the *limelight*
