@entity0 -- an @entity3 - language immersion class failed @entity4 , her mother contended			1
a divided @entity6 dismissed on thursday a 17 - year - old suit filed on behalf of @entity3 - deficient students			1
after two years of instruction in her native @entity10 , @entity4 entered the @entity11 , @entity15 schools ' @entity13 program as a third - grader			1
however , she continued to lag behind her classmates and was cited as a disruptive influence in the classroom because she often had to ask a fellow student for help			0
the girl 's mother , also named @entity24 , and other minority parents claimed school officials in @entity11 , a border town about 70 miles south of @entity27 , did not provide enough money to get @entity3 - deficient students up to speed in writing and reading comprehension			1
in 2000 , a federal judge agreed , concluding @entity15 violated the @entity33 , and ordering the state to rework its plan and increase funding			1
the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) program was then placed under federal oversight			1
on thursday , a divided @entity6 dismissed the 17 - year - old lawsuit , but ordered a federal judge to review whether @entity11 officials are " providing equal opportunities " to mainly @entity10 - speaking students in the community			1
@entity15 maintained the federal court injunction delayed its plans to fix the system			2
it maintained it has provided enough resources to improve its @entity13 program , allowing it to end federal oversight			2
" injunctions of this sort bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their predecessors , " wrote justice @entity53 for the majority			0
some legislators claim a 2006 state law essentially eliminated long - standing funding inequities			2
but parents say officials continue to drag their feet when it comes to complying with an appropriate classroom model for non-english - speaking students			0
@entity15 says it increased more than twofold the amount of money it spends per @entity3 - speaking pupil , and that it has complied with the @entity74 , the sweeping public classroom accountability act passed in 2002 that ties federal education funding to improvements in measurable student achievement			1
the current dispute has pitted the @entity80 - led state legislature and the school superintendent against the @entity83 governor and attorney general , along with civil rights and teacher groups			0
@entity53 said a federal law guaranteeing equal opportunity in public schools " is a vitally important one , and our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to achieve that goal			2
" he added that if state officials ultimately prevail in their reform efforts , " it will be because they have shown that the @entity98 is doing exactly what this statute requires -- taking appropriate action to teach @entity3 to students who grew up speaking another language			0
" @entity53 was backed by chief justice @entity106 and justices @entity107 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
but in a lengthy dissent -- parts of which were read from the bench -- justice @entity115 said the ruling was " misguided , " calling it " a mistaken effort to drive a wedge between review of funding plan changes and review of changes that would bring the state into compliance with federal law			0
" he was backed by justices @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity130			0
the divided court seemed poised to issue a narrow ruling , fact - specific to the @entity13 plan in @entity11			2
but groups on both sides of the issue asked the high court for broader guidance on settling state - federal conflicts involving institutional reform mandates , especially those involving disadvantaged groups			1
such political turf battles often end up in the courts , and can lead to decades of federal oversight , such as the fight over school desegregation beginning in the 1950s			1
against that backdrop is the continuing fight over immigration and the responsibility of states to fund the education of illegal immigrants and their children			0
@entity4 is now an adult and a student at the @entity158			0
the cases are @entity160 v. @entity4 ( 08 - 289 ) and speaker of the @entity162 v. @entity4 ( 08 - 294 ) .			0

@entity6 dismisses case that claimed schools failed @entity3 - deficient kids
the 17 - year - old case began in @entity11 , @entity15 , a border town
a federal judge agreed and ordered increased funding and federal oversight
both sides seek help from high court in *resolving* political turf wars over reforms
