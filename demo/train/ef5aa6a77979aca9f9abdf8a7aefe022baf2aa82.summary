-- @entity1 routed 10 - man @entity2 8 - 0 at @entity4 on sunday to dethrone @entity5 as @entity7 champions			1
@entity5 , who needed @entity1 to slip up in the final match of the season , beat @entity11 4 - 0 at @entity12 , but it proved academic as @entity1 brushed aside @entity2 in ruthless fashion			1
first half goals from @entity15 and @entity16 from the penalty spot effectively sealed the title for @entity20 's high - scoring team , but they turned on the style after the break to delight their fans			2
@entity2 , a man light after @entity25 was sent off just before halftime in conceding the penalty , were overwhelmed as @entity28 hit a second half hat - trick			1
his strike partner @entity15 added a second , with @entity32 and @entity33 left back @entity34 also on target			0
big - spending @entity1 have had to play second fiddle while @entity5 have won three straight titles and it was a sweet moment for their captain @entity39			1

" it 's been up and down all year and we went away to @entity2 and got beat , but after we went ahead 1 - 0 today it was the first time i thought that the title was ours , " he added			1
@entity1 can complete the domestic double with victory over cash - strapped @entity53 in the @entity55 final at @entity56 next weekend , while for @entity5 there was bitter disappointment as they remained a point adrift			1
@entity61 also sparked a @entity63 scare when he limped out of the easy win at @entity12 with what appeared to be a recurrence of the groin problem he first picked up at @entity69 last month			2
before that , @entity70 and @entity71 scored before the break			0
a @entity75 own goal and @entity77 's late diving header doubled their advantage but it was all in vain			0
@entity61 had gone into the match level with @entity28 on 26 league goals in the race for the @entity85 , but could not add to his tally			2
@entity87 international @entity28 had been denied the chance to take @entity1 's first half penalty as regular taker @entity16 ushered him away			2
he openly showed his disappointment , but after the break all was forgotten as he finally got on the scoresheet , including a penalty , with @entity16 this time making way as the victory was assured			0
@entity28 's first and @entity1 's fifth took them to 100 goals for the season , the first time this has been achieved since the @entity7 was created			1
but @entity20 revealed that he had to speak with @entity28 at halftime to tell him to calm down			0
" it was my decision , if there was a penalty , to give it to @entity16 , " he told @entity103			0
" i told him to stay calm and quiet because he 'd have opportunities to score in the second half			0
i said : ' quiet			0
you can score in the second half			0
" ' in other action on the final day of the season , @entity111 clinched third spot with a 4 - 0 home win over @entity118 finalists @entity116 while north @entity120 rivals @entity119 stay fourth after losing 4 - 2 at relegated @entity121 .			1
