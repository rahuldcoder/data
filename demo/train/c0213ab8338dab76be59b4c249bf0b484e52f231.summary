families torn apart for more than 60 years -- separated by the @entity1 -- began to reunite at a mountain resort in @entity3 thursday			1
without any regular forms of communications between the two @entity7 , the family members have gone decades without phone calls , letters or emails -- unable to know whether their loved ones are alive or dead			0
the majority of the participants in @entity14 are now in their 80s and 90s			1
the meetings are likely to be the last time the separated families will have contact with one another			1
thursday 's reunion is the first since november 2010			0
the negotiations leading to the expected reunions have also been painstaking , reflecting the tensions between @entity3 and @entity14 governments			1
past reunions have been emotional affairs with sobbing relatives clinging to each other and showing each other family photos			0
this time , the reunion was n't conducted as freely as @entity3 workers stood beside the tables and listened to every conversation			1
one @entity3 resident thanked the @entity36 , which is the country 's leader , @entity37 for his " blessing " and making the visit possible			1
on thursday , the first of a six - day event , an initial 200 @entity41 met			1
among them was @entity45 , whose brother was 8 years old when he last saw him			0
@entity45 , a @entity3 conscript during the @entity1 , was taken prisoner by @entity50 forces in @entity14			1
he has since lived in the @entity14 and has been unable to see his family			1
but four years ago , he received a letter and several photos of his family in @entity3 through the @entity54			1
the black - and - white photos showed his brother and a picture of his brother 's wedding -- major life milestones @entity45 had been unable to attend			2
" it was shocking , " he said			0
" i did n't even know they were alive although i had hoped they were			0
after reading the letter , i started crying , i was filled with both joy and sorrow			0
" @entity45 clutched the only memorabilia he has of his long - lost family			2
" whenever i miss my family , i read this letter , " @entity45 said			0
@entity45 , silver - haired and aging , thought he finally got his chance when he learned he 'd be part of a reunion group last september			2
the reunion waitlist in @entity76 has thousands of names and the lucky ones are selected through a computer - generated lottery			0
but @entity80 canceled the september event with only a few days notice , accusing @entity76 of souring ties between the two countries			0
" it was like being hit on the back of the head , " @entity45 said about the shock of coming so close , only to have his hopes dashed			0
" i had to take medication and sedatives			0
" it may have felt like deja - vu for @entity45 earlier this month			0
after the @entity14 governments reached an agreement to hold reunions , less than a day later , @entity3 said it may back out if @entity14 holds its annual military drills with the @entity98			1
@entity14 has refused to cancel the annual drills			2
@entity80 's attempts to link the reunions to politics were rejected by both @entity76 and @entity103 who see it as a purely humanitarian issue			0
@entity45 finally got his wish , trembling , while he held the hands of his younger brother , @entity110 and younger sister @entity112 soon , who both live in @entity3			2
@entity45 had brought his son , @entity114 , who met his @entity3 uncle and aunt for the first time			2
they learned coincidentally that both @entity45 's son and his younger brother had become locomotive engineers			0
@entity45 's younger sister burst into tears during the conversation			0
" every time a train passes by , i thought ( about you ) , " @entity112 soon told her @entity14 brother , sobbing			2
" i missed you , older brother			0
" @entity45 's son vowed to his @entity3 aunt and uncle : " i will drive a train and come here			2
i am a locomotive engineer so i will drive the train and promise to come back			0
until then , please stay healthy and live a long life			0
" although delayed by snow , 82 @entity14 participants accompanied by 58 other members arrived thursday afternoon and were scheduled to have lunch before finally meeting their families			1
the reunion ended for the day around 5 p.m. trust remains tenuous in the peninsula , separated by the world 's most fortified border â€” the @entity145 and rocked by @entity3 's nuclear test last year			1
the rarity of @entity149 reunions meant that many participants in ill health insisted on going to @entity152 for the event , desperate for a chance to see their relatives			2
nineteen of the @entity14 participants were in wheelchairs			1
two @entity14 participants departed for the reunion venue by ambulance , one of them was receiving an iv drip , refusing to miss the date			1
@entity14 participants of the reunion were seen bringing gifts for their family members			1
the most popular gifts for families in @entity3 were @entity172 , a chocolate - covered treat , along with medicine and medical supplies like pain killers , according to @entity177 , a @entity178 affiliate in @entity14			1
they were greeted with a newly - made stone near their @entity3 facilities that read : " long live general @entity37 , @entity182			1
