@entity1 , @entity2 it is impossible to measure a family 's grief after a disaster like the crash of @entity8			1
and for one family , they 're grappling with the loss of seven loved ones on the aircraft			1
two of their family members have been found so far			1
a total of 37 bodies have been recovered out of 162 passengers and crew members on board the @entity8 flight			1
we were invited to a @entity1 funeral home where the family held a visitation for @entity27 and her daughter , @entity28			1
@entity28 had just turned 10 , two weeks before the flight			2
the two were on their way to a @entity32 's trip in @entity33 with five other members of their family , including @entity28 's father , grandmother , brother , sister , and her sister 's fiancee			1
the remaining five have not been found yet			0
" i am devastated , " said @entity43 , a relative of the victims			0
" and now , the waiting for the rest of the family is so difficult			1
" while the funerals for @entity27 and her daughter will take place on friday , friends and families gathered this week to pay their respects to the mother and her young child			1
" my sister was a businesswoman , " said her sister , @entity58			0
she was kind to everybody			0
" @entity28 was described as a bright girl by her relatives			2
she was always full of cheer , they said			0
in a @entity68 ceremony , friends and family members lit candles on an altar and bowed in front of the two caskets			2
they also folded paper into what resembled money as part of a @entity68 tradition of burning " money " to symbolically provide for their loved ones in the afterlife			0
earlier last week , they continued to hold out hope that some or all of their family members might have survived the crash			2
but with the discovery of mother and daughter 's bodies , the hope for a miracle has all but disappeared			1
while they mourn and plan a funeral , they still have to monitor the news and wait for any word about their five other loved ones			2
" i can not accept this			0
i can not believe it			0
where are my family 's bodies ? where is my mother ? my heart is breaking , " said family member @entity43			1
they told me it 's like a nightmare you ca n't wake up from			0
the @entity27 was going to spend her 46th birthday in @entity33			0
instead , her birthday was the day her body was found			0

family mourns the loss of seven loved ones on @entity8
mother and daughter 's bodies were retrieved ; funeral to be held on friday
relatives are still waiting for the five other members who were on board the flight
