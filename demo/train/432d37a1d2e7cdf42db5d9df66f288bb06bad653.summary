-- president @entity1 has properly decided to go to @entity2 and then the @entity4 people this week to reveal his strategy to degrade and destroy the @entity6 ( @entity6 or @entity6 )			1
to paraphrase former white house chief of staff @entity8 , this is a crisis the president should not waste			2
how individual members of @entity2 respond to this call should matter and should be a 2014 election issue -- the duck and blame game stops here			1
since september 11 , 2001 , the relationship between @entity2 and the president has collapsed			1
following the lead of president @entity19 , president @entity1 has used @entity22 commander - in - chief authorities , plus the quaint and seemingly ancient 2001 @entity23 , or @entity23 , to hijack @entity2 ' constitutional responsibility over war and peace			1
as a member of @entity2 , i witnessed the transformation			2
i was there on 9/11 and a senior member of the @entity32			0
but @entity34 speaker @entity33 , the @entity35 recently pointed out , is the only member of @entity34 @entity37 leadership who was in office on the day that changed this country			0
and @entity41 have faced turnover , too ; institutional memory of a time before the 2001 @entity23 is fading fast			0
speaking to @entity44 for " @entity45 " this weekend , @entity1 suggested he has " the authorization he needs " for the mission he has in mind , - but no one is clear on what authority he 's invoking			1
@entity53 , writing for @entity52 , suggested recently that the @entity1 administration might think it can restart the @entity56 clock with each notification it sends to @entity2			1
by this otherworldly interpretation , we are n't fighting a war with @entity6 , we 're picking a dozen sequential fights with @entity6 ( which calls itself the " @entity63 " ) , and will continue doing so until the president decides he has achieved his objectives			2
with all this going on , it 's no wonder that we 've struggled to craft a coherent response to this depraved band of thugs			0
there 's a reason @entity1 does n't feel able to trust this hyper - partisan @entity2 , but this is a poor way of shaping strategy			1
it 's also an attitude that blows the @entity75 to pieces and evokes @entity78 's actions in @entity79			0
but it does n't have to be this way			0
a change can start immediately , at no cost to the president			0
when he speaks with congressional leaders , @entity1 should -- at the very least -- be explicit about what he believes his authorities to be			2
can he strike @entity87 on his own authority ? can he keep up the air campaign in @entity90 indefinitely by hitting the snooze button on the @entity56 alarm every few weeks ? if he believes the answer is yes , @entity2 deserves to know as much			1
but if the president believes he has these authorities , he 's setting a very dangerous precedent			0
he does need a vote -- and he should want it , too			0
president @entity1 has an opportunity to unite @entity2 and the @entity4 people behind a cause on which they seem ( for a change ) to agree			1
this is not the same country that @entity1 addressed last year , when @entity87 president @entity106 's use of chemical weapons came to light			1
in september 2013 , 55 % of @entity4 opposed airstrikes against @entity106 even if the president were to secure congressional approval			1
today , 60 % of @entity4 , including majorities in both parties , support air and drone strikes against @entity6 in @entity87			1
if the president will explain and defend his plan for countering @entity6 , he likely has a congressional and public majority ready to back it			2
its outlines are clear : no @entity4 boots on the ground ; strikes on @entity6 wherever it is ( @entity90 , @entity87 , and beyond if necessary ) ; sustained support for the @entity127 , @entity87 opposition fighters , and @entity90 troops on the front lines ; and a coalition of @entity132 and @entity133 nations dedicated to shepherding @entity6 into its grave			1
this seems to be the fight that president @entity1 already has in mind			1
on tuesday , he should ask congressional leaders for the authority to wage it			0
on wednesday , he should be clear about his objectives and the costs , and he should ask the @entity4 people for their support			2
and on thursday , we should hope to mark a sea change in the way the @entity4 conducts foreign policy			2
we used to treat these debates with reverence			0
describing the vote to authorize the use of military force in the @entity154 , venerable sen. @entity150 said , " i 've cast 12,822 votes during my 39 years in @entity2 , but this vote is the most important vote that i shall have cast in my career			0
" we could use more of that spirit today -- and we 'll need it when the next threat , whatever it may be , rears its head			0
after all , the current dysfunction is deeper than @entity6			0
the fact is that this crisis can be an opportunity for both ends of @entity168			0
the duck and blame game on this issue is n't good politics -- and it 's reckless policy .			2

@entity178 : president @entity1 is right to go to @entity2 over @entity6 strategy
since 9/11 , relationship between @entity2 , president has collapsed , @entity182 says
poll : 60 % of @entity4 support air and drone strikes against @entity6 in @entity87
crisis over @entity6 can be seen as opportunity to *abandon* blame - game politics , @entity182 adds
