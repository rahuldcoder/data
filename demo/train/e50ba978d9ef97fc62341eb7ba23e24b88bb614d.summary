@entity0 , @entity1 -- the leader of the @entity4 in @entity1 , @entity5 , was wounded in a suspected @entity7 drone strike thursday , intelligence and @entity4 sources told @entity2 friday			1
a @entity4 spokesman denied thursday and again friday that @entity5 was hurt			1
the spokesman , @entity11 , said @entity5 had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck			1
he dismissed reports of an injury to @entity5 as propaganda			1
other @entity4 and intelligence sources , however , said doctors were treating @entity5 for wounds he sustained in the drone strike			1
the drone attack killed 10 people , with four missiles landing near a madrassa , or religious school , @entity1 intelligence and local officials said thursday			1
the school had been converted into a training camp for militants , the officials said			0
meanwhile friday , another suspected drone strike killed five people in the village of @entity38 , in @entity39 , two intelligence sources said			1
no additional details were immediately available			0
the @entity7 military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones , or unmanned aircraft			0
the @entity7 is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote - controlled aircraft			0
the strike happened in the village of @entity52			2
that 's in @entity39 , part of @entity1 's volatile tribal region that is the site of previous drone strikes and clashes between the @entity1 military and @entity61 militants			1
it comes a few days after @entity5 appeared in a video the @entity1 @entity4 released			1
in it , he sits next to @entity65 , the man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven @entity68 employees and a @entity70 army captain at a base in eastern @entity72 on december 30			1
the @entity1 @entity4 claimed responsibility for that attack			1
it was carried out out to avenge the death of @entity5 's predecessor , @entity76 , who died in a suspected @entity7 drone strike last year , according to @entity79 's commander of operations in @entity72 , @entity81			1
@entity76 and @entity5 are from the same tribe , not from the same family			2
in the video , @entity84 said , " we will never forget the blood of our leader @entity76 , may @entity88 have mercy on his soul , " according to a @entity2 translation			2
" it will remain that we take revenge ( for his death ) in @entity7 and outside @entity7			0
it is a trust on every person who left everything for the sake of @entity88 , whom @entity76 supported			0
" at one point , the video shows the date of december 20 , 2009			2
that is five days before @entity105 passenger @entity104 allegedly tried to blow up a @entity107 flight to @entity108 , @entity109			0
the @entity111 - based group @entity110 has claimed responsibility for the @entity114 plot			0
it is impossible to know whether the date on the video is accurate , or whether @entity84 was aware of @entity104 's alleged plans			0
if @entity84 did know about the plot , it could indicate a greater degree of communication between the @entity1 @entity4 and @entity79 than previously thought			2
among the seven @entity68 employees who were killed in the december 30 attack were two members of the private security firm @entity125 , formerly known as @entity125			1
the @entity70 military officer who was killed was @entity128 capt. @entity127 , a cousin of @entity70 's @entity129 it was one of the worst attacks ever on @entity7 's intelligence community			0
@entity70 and @entity7 intelligence agencies apparently believed @entity84 had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt @entity136 , @entity79 's no. 2 figure , a former @entity7 intelligence official said			0
@entity139 was a @entity70 doctor whom @entity70 authorities had recruited as a counterterrorism intelligence source , a @entity70 official told @entity2			0
he said the video that his faith can not be sold to bidders , an apparent message to @entity70 and @entity7 officials that they had failed to win his allegiance			0
it puts into question how well the @entity68 and other intelligence agencies can penetrate @entity79			2
journalist @entity152 contributed to this report			0

@entity5 appeared in a video released *saturday* by @entity4
