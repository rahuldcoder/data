-- the worst kept secret in @entity2 is finally out -- @entity3 is leaving @entity4 and will be replaced by @entity5			1
@entity7 's four - time world champion has signed a three - year contract with the @entity4 , the oldest team in @entity2 , from 2015			1
after ending his five - year stint at @entity4 , @entity3 remains coy on where he will be driving next season			1
the double move by two of the sport 's high profile world champions is the most significant in the driver market this season			2
but in the fickle world of @entity2 there are no guarantees it will work out for either of the ambitious racers			0
there are still seats to be filled at @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
with the curtain about to fall on the 2014 season at sunday 's @entity31 , hopeful drivers have just one more chance to stake their claim for the remaining seats			0
where will @entity3 go ? @entity3 is regarded as the best all - round driver currently racing at the elite level of motorsport , a fact many of his peers are even happily willing to acknowledge			2
the @entity41 -- a double world champion with @entity43 in 2005 and 2006 -- is regarded as the key to the @entity2 driver market			1
the 33 - year - old made it clear he wanted to leave @entity4 , even though he had two years left to run on his contract with the @entity50 team , but he has yet to confirm where he will go next			1
a return to @entity25 seems most likely , despite his acrimonious departure from the team after just a single season as @entity57 's teammate in 2007			1
@entity25 is about to embark on a new phase after reigniting its relationship with engine manufacturer @entity60			0
@entity3 is expected to lead this new era at @entity25 , although the fiercely ambitious driver may first want guarantees that the @entity60 engine is going to be a success			1
keeping the media guessing about his future -- and maybe his future employers too -- seems to have provided @entity3 with plenty of sport off track			0
speculation in the media has seen @entity3 linked with buying the @entity74 team , joining forces with @entity78 sports car specialists @entity76 and even ousting @entity79 or @entity57 at @entity80			2
@entity3 remained typically tight lipped about his future plans when he was questioned by the media at the @entity83 season finale			0
has @entity5 made the right decision ? @entity5 has endured his worst season at @entity7 in 2014 , failing to win a race compared to three victories for his rookie teammate @entity88			1
since his full debut season for @entity27 in 2008 , the @entity78 has won at least one race a year , not to mention winning four straight world championships between 2010 and 2013			0
the 27 - year - old is now hoping to succeed where @entity3 failed at @entity4 by adding to his collection of world titles			1
" the next stage of my @entity2 career will be spent with @entity4 and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true , " @entity5 said			2
" when i was a kid , @entity5 in the red car was my greatest idol and now it 's an incredible honor to finally get the chance to drive a @entity4			1
" i am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top			0
i will put my heart and soul into making it happen			0
" @entity5 will partner @entity110 -- the last man to win a world title with @entity4 in 2007 -- in 2015 but there are no guarantees the car and its @entity4 engine will be any match for the might of @entity80			1
who will drive for @entity25 ? @entity25 has tried to dampen speculation over just who will be in its cars in 2015 in the build - up to this weekend 's season - ending race			1
" we know you 're awaiting news on our driver line - up			1
we 'll announce after december 1 -- you 'll hear it here first , " the team said on @entity129			2
@entity3 remains the red - hot favorite to take one of the seats but the future of current drivers @entity136 and @entity137 remains unclear			0
@entity136 -- the 2009 world champion with @entity138 which has since morphed into @entity80 -- has remained sanguine about his future and has even explored the idea of moving to sports car racing			2
@entity142 rookie @entity137 is fiercely passionate about staying with @entity25 , the team which gave the 22 - year - old his @entity2 debut in 2014			1
" there is no @entity148 , " the @entity142 told @entity0 when asked if had explored his options if he was n't retained by the eight - time world champions			1
which other teams have seats to fill ? @entity80 , @entity7 , @entity4 , @entity151 , @entity74 and @entity152 have all confirmed their driver pairings for 2015			1
there are still seats on offer at @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			0
@entity26 has already announced it will retain @entity78 @entity157 for 2015 but @entity159 @entity158 has not had his position with the team confirmed			0
there 's also only one seat up for grabs at @entity27 , who will blood 17 - year - old @entity165 as the youngest f1 driver in history next season			1
junior @entity7 driver @entity170 is in pole position for the second seat -- and the @entity41 has been named as a test driver for @entity7 at the end of season test in @entity83 -- although @entity27 may still retain @entity178 racer @entity177			2
@entity152 announced swede @entity179 and @entity181 @entity180 as its 2015 drivers in november much to the chagrin of current driver @entity184 , who believed he had a contract with the team for next season			2
@entity188 and @entity180 are both pay drivers , backed by sponsors who bring an estimated $ 30m funding to the @entity195 team			0
grid shrinks to 18 in 2015 ? the @entity2 market may be flooded with plenty of eager racers but the number of seats has been squeezed			0
the financial pressures on the @entity204 and @entity205 teams , which both went into administration in october , means there are , in theory , only 18 spots on the @entity2 grid in 2015			0
after missing the @entity212 and @entity181 grands prix , @entity204 has used crowdfunding to help finance a return in @entity83			0
@entity217 's @entity216 retained his drive while the team has also handed @entity220 and former tester @entity221 his @entity2 debut			0
both @entity204 and @entity205 remain on the official entry list for the 2015 season but their future is dependent on a hard winter drumming up funding to stay in the sport			0
with teams spending a minimum of $ 70m per season , employing a driver who offers pace , performance and a pot of personal talent is more important than ever for those teams for ca n't afford super-talents like @entity3 .			2

@entity5 signs a three - year contract with @entity4 from 2015
@entity7 's four - time world champion replaces @entity3
@entity3 has still to announce which team he will drive for next season
@entity25 says it will not announce its driver line - up until 1 december
