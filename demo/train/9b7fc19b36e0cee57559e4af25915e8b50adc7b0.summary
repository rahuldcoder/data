multiple reports have surfaced on the web today that filmmakers @entity4 and @entity6 are the final two contenders for the director of " @entity10 " sequel " @entity11			1
" ( the @entity12 appears to have first broke the story			0
) the choice for the replacement of " @entity16 ' " @entity17 -- who bowed out of the " @entity11 " gig last week , citing the tight production schedule -- are pretty stark			1
@entity4 has extensive experience with visual effects - driven action sequences from his first two films , 2005â € ²s supernatural thriller " @entity24 " and 2007â € ²s post-apocalyptic thriller " @entity27 " -- which shares a similarly bleak tone to " catching fire			1
" but his latest effort , the 2011 period drama " @entity31 , " fizzled at the box office , and landed mixed reviews for its handling of the star - crossed romance between @entity37 and @entity38			2
many complained that the weakest part of " @entity16 " was the romance between @entity42 ( @entity43 , no relation ) , and @entity45 ( @entity46 ) , and the romantic angle is far more front - and - center for " @entity11			1
" @entity6 , by contrast , has practically no first - hand experience with cg - effects - heavy action scenes , and " @entity11 " features more exotic locations that would likely call for extensive green - screen and effects work			1
@entity6 does , however , have an @entity59 nomination to his name for his debut feature , the 2005 biopic " @entity56 , " and last year 's " @entity57 " won @entity6 wide acclaim			1
he could bring an actor - friendly pedigree to the franchise , and it would certainly be a high - profile boost to his career trajectory			0
but @entity6 has another film , the true - life drama " @entity69 , " that 's aiming to start production this fall , with @entity71 and @entity72 attached and @entity73 in talks to join			2
that project would almost certainly need to be put on hold ; it seems unlikely that @entity78 would be willing to delay production on " @entity11 " until after @entity43 finished shooting the " x-men : @entity82 " sequel next spring , especially since they did n't do it for @entity17			2
@entity78 reportedly may have their decision made by the end of this week			0
