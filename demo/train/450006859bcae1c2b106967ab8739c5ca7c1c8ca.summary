underneath the @entity6 in @entity7			2
scientists first made the discovery by accident in 2003 using sonar to survey the bottom of the lake but published their findings only recently			0
" we just bumped into it , " recalls @entity15 , a geophysicist from @entity16 who worked on the project			0
" usually the bottom of the lake is quite smooth			0
we were surprised to find a large mound			0
initially we did n't realize the importance of this but we consulted with a couple of archaeologists , and they said it looked like an unusually large @entity28 statue			0
" the structure is comprised of basalt rocks , arranged in the shape of a cone			1
it measures 230 feet ( 70 meters ) at the base of the structure , is 32 feet ( 10 meters ) tall , and weighs an estimated 60,000 tons			1
it is twice the size of the ancient stone circle at @entity38 in @entity39			1
its size and location , say @entity15 , who also took video of the structure during a scuba dive to examine it , indicated it could have been constructed underwater as a type of fish nursery			1
however archeologists think it more likely it was built on dry land and later submerged by the lake			1
" from a geophysical perspective , it is also important to the history of the lake , because it means the water level was lower than it was today , " says @entity15			0
according to @entity61 , the archeologist who led the study , the fact that the structure is underwater has made it a particularly difficult study			2
" if the site was inland , it would be much easier to investigate			2
by now we would have excavated , but because it 's submerged we have n't yet been able to			1
it is a much harder process , both physically and financially			0
it is very expensive to raise support for such an enterprise			0
" watch : bringing ancient @entity73 back from the dead the exact age of the structure has been difficult to pinpoint , but calculations based on the six to ten feet ( two to three meters ) of sand that have accumulated over the bottom of the base -- sand accumulates an average of one to four millimeters per year -- as well as comparisons to other structures in the region , put the estimate anywhere between 2,000 and 12,000 years old			1
the possible purpose of the structure is even more enigmatic			1
@entity89 , an archeologist from the @entity90 , who partnered on the site , and who has led several prehistoric excavations in the region , notes it shares similarities with communal burial sites , though he 's quick to discourage anyone from drawing a definitive conclusion			1
" this is such a huge structure that it truly is something unusual			1
it could have been a big ceremonial structure , or a ramp			1
there could have once been statues on top of people in certain rituals			0
i mean , i 'm really going wild here			0
the truth is we do n't know how it was constructed , what its exact age is , how it was used , or how long ago it was used			0
we have several speculations , but we do n't know much except that it 's there and it 's huge			1
" despite the limitations of examining underwater ruins , @entity89 says that once they do raise the funds to excavate , there is a good likelihood that their findings will be more complete than would be possible with a land - based structure			1

underwater , you do n't have oxygen , so the process of decomposition is on a much smaller scale , " he says			0
@entity89 points to @entity141 , a site he excavated near the @entity6 that had been submerged for 23,000 years before a drop in water level made it easy to excavate			1
@entity141 is significant because it was one of the best preserved prehistoric sites in the world			0
" in most sites , you 're lucky to find five or ten seeds			0
at @entity141 , we found 150,000			2
we learned a lot about the diet ( of the inhabitants ) , what fish they were eating , what animals they were hunting			0
when a site is underwater it gives us the opportunity to see history in much more detail			2
" what archeologists are certain of is that the monument was likely of great importance to the people who built it			1
@entity15 notes that the nearest basalt outcrop was a few hundred meters from the site , and that the stones , which were three to six feet ( one to two meters ) in width , would have weighed over 200 pounds ( 90 kilograms ) at times			2
" we see a society that was capable of organizing the construction of such a large structure			2
it 's unique to transport these stones and unique to arrange them			2
you need to plan and to mobilize people , because they 're too heavy to be carried by a single person			0
" @entity89 points out that given the harsh environment such a structure was a particularly impressive accomplishment			2
" you have to imagine , " says @entity89 , " these people were building something that was more durable than their brush huts			0

ancient structure twice the size of @entity38 found submerged
thought to be between 2,000 and 12,000 years old
archeologists believe it was built on land then later submerged
guesses as to site 's purpose ; could be ceremonial structure or huge ramp
