-- an international scientific expedition has revealed a @entity4 island roughly the size of @entity6 and clearly marked on online maps and marine charts does not , in fact , exist			1
the ' undiscovery ' of the island -- which until now was midway between @entity12 and @entity13 -- highlights how much there still is to learn about the oceans , scientists say			1
" we saw this mysterious island on all the scientific maps and weather maps but not on this one navigational chart that was on our ship , " ph.d student @entity16 , part of the research team on board the @entity20 , told @entity0			1
" so we decided to go see if it was actually there			0
" the ship did n't find an island the island , identified as @entity31 by @entity32 and @entity33 on others , was supposed to be quite large in size -- 156 square kilometers ( 60 square miles ) -- but the ship sailed right through the area where the island was supposed to be			1
7 places that inspire gratitude " the captain was actually quite nervous because the island was showing up on all the maps , " @entity16 said			1
the undiscovery was made during the ship 's voyage this month			2
although the team had originally planned to check out the existence of the island during the day , they had arrived at the location of the island at night due to a navigational error			2
" we were watching all of our depth - sounding equipment			0
luckily for us the sea floor turned out to be very deep there , " said @entity16 , who is studying the tectonic evolution of the eastern @entity56			0
the implications are significant although the undiscovery of the island was not part of the original research mission of the international team of scientists led by @entity69 's dr. @entity68 , the implications of the wrong maps are significant			1
" all the scientific cartography relies on these maps , and numerical simulations of waves and currents depend on size of these land forms , " said @entity16			0
eat like a local : share your picks " it just goes to show the oceans are so underexposed			0
it 's actually really shocking that we have n't not found more islands			0
" when asked about the @entity32 mistake , a @entity32 spokesperson told @entity0 that keeping on top of changes is a " never - ending endeavor , " and that @entity32 will continuously explore ways to integrate new information from users .			2
