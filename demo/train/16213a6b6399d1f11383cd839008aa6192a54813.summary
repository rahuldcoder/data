-- one day there will be no one alive who remembers			2
today , as we solemnly observe the tenth anniversary of september 11 , 2001 , virtually every living @entity4 adult has his or her own vivid memory of that morning			1
it all feels very personal , because it was			2
but 100 years from now , 150 years from now , when everyone who remembers is gone , what will the legacy of the terrible day have evolved into ? and will the war be over ? that is the essential question			1
the war on terror is unlike any other the @entity4 has fought , and because of this there can be no genuine sense of closure , even after ceremonies as moving and heartfelt as the ones planned for sunday will certainly be			1
the nation can express respect , and sorrow , and determined resolve on this 10th anniversary of the day			2
but closure -- bowing heads and praying one more time , and then moving on ? not possible , with this war			1
the morning after will arrive on schedule on monday , but the nature of the war in which we are engaged almost guarantees a succession of mornings after without end			1
i have a copy of a memo of sorts , a teletype , that was sent out in september 1945			2
its author was not identified by name , but by title : supreme commander for the @entity48			0
the recipients were his colleagues : the commanding general of the @entity51 , the commanding general of the @entity53 , the commander of the @entity55			0
. i look at the memo from time to time because it is such a stark reminder of the way our current war will not conclude			1
the text , in that teletype style of those years , was all in capital letters : " formal surrender of the @entity65 controlled armed forces wherever located was signed on the battleship missouri in @entity69 at 0908 on september 2nd 1945			1
" and that was it : the @entity72 was over			1
we may be destined to have no day like that			0
as much death and devastation as there was during @entity72 , as many families who lost their young soldiers , at least the nightmare ended			1
it may have been difficult for @entity4 to believe for a while -- after the years of war , it may have seemed too good to be true : peace had come			1
but eventually @entity4 must have begun to awaken without the knots in their stomachs , without the fear for loved ones in their hearts			1
the danger had been defeated ; the enemy was vanquished			0
the war was past tense			2
the enemy , as we have been told from the start , wears no uniform , flies no flag			0
on sunday we mourn and give renewed thanks for the bravery of those who were so valiant in trying to save lives 10 years ago			2
and monday the sun will rise over a nation still wishing for true tranquillity			1
there is a phrase that has been used in the context both of soldiers and of civilians in past @entity4 wars : " for the duration			1
" the phrase has signified that life will be altered until the war is over			2
but what happens when " for the duration " has no end date ? when the duration is infinite ? another wartime phrase : " on full alert			0
" yet no person , no nation , can remain on full alert indefinitely			0
the body -- the human body , the body politic -- is not made for it			0
full alert is an emergency response			0
and when the emergency never ends , guards -- both physical and emotional -- are inevitably let down , not by choice but out of pure fatigue			0
the men and women who personally recall december 7 , 1941 , are dying off			0
the day of the attack on @entity138 is remembered firsthand by relatively few @entity4 , and because of that , there are years when the anniversary of the date -- the date president @entity143 vowed would live in infamy -- is allowed to pass with little notice			1
that is something to ponder on this september 11 anniversary , as we consider how the date will be marked a century and more from now when there is no one left alive to remember what it felt like , no one who wept on that morning			2
perhaps -- even probably -- there will be additional awful days that @entity4 will face , more dates that will be recalled with tears			1
september 11 , 2001 , may be pushed toward the middle of the history books , regarded as an older sorrow			2
and there will be generations of children whose birthdays are september 11 , generations of husbands and wives whose wedding dates , and anniversaries , will be september 11			0
the notion may seem a little odd , now , but in fact it has already begun			0
the world , saddened , turns on its axis			0
it has no other choice			0
the morning after always arrives			0
the act of remembrance , meant to help , still hurts			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 says years from now , many may not remember 9/11 . will the war even be over ?
he says remembrances are moving but ca *n't* be expected to bring resolution to attacks
he says @entity72 ended with a surrender ; no such thing is expected in this war
@entity183 : on monday @entity4 will still be wishing for tranquillity , even as event fades into history
