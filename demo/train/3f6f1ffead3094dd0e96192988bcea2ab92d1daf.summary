-- just hours before the opening ceremony of his new @entity3 , @entity1 caused a minor stir on @entity5 during a " @entity12 " interview in which he endorsed @entity7 for president , claiming that " @entity9 is a business and should be run by a businessman			1
" such a blatantly capitalist statement is n't surprising from @entity1 -- as he told @entity0 minutes before he 'd make his red carpet entrance with his family in tow , " i 'm not outspoken , i just say things that make people say , ' yeah , you 're right			2
' i hate nazis like you do and i hate bulls * * *			0
" in fact , the @entity24 branch of @entity3 felt as much like a subtly protracted dry run for a potential @entity28 candidacy as it was a restaurant opening			1
in part of the introductory presentation , he exclaimed " @entity24 may mean ' the second city ' in @entity33 , but today it 's the first city ! " admittedly , the restaurant 's ambitions to connect with the city are very real if bluntly wielded -- earlier in the day , @entity3 had a luncheon to benefit the @entity39 program , and during the presentation , two dismembered soldiers with @entity41 were presented with a $ 25,000 check			1
prior to the presentation , @entity1 led the crowd in the @entity44			2
" if you know it , say it with me			0
if you do n't , shame on you , " he intoned as @entity9 flags waved on television monitors			0
in line with @entity3 ' concurrent opening at the @entity55 in nearby @entity56 , it 's essentially and proudly an up - the - middle sports bar with pictures of @entity58 on the walls ; despite being a collaboration between a rock legend and a couple of big - shot entrepreneurs , it does n't clash with the sleepy , suburban surroundings			1
as the introductory three - minute video came to a close , @entity70 's " @entity69 " played , a likely allusion to the fact that @entity3 is actually located on @entity69 in downtown @entity24			1
so what the hell are we doing in @entity24 anyway ? not surprisingly , he 's got words for his doubters : " they 're unqualified to snicker or do much else			1
they 've never done anything			0
what are their qualifications ? what i 'm doing here proves to every small town in @entity9 that they are every bit as cool as @entity88 and @entity89			0
@entity24 , great place to live			2
small town @entity9 is what it 's all about and that 's where @entity95 got big			2
" let it be known that he did insist we try the food ( " there 's no other way to describe it except that it rocks " ) and stressed the family - friendliness of @entity3 -- " you wan na bring your dog , your kids ? great ! they can have a root beer float and you can choose from 100 craft beers			1
the brews are local from @entity24 and @entity114			2
cool can go f * * * itself			0
" @entity1 connected the populism of his restaurant with everything from disco 's inclusion in the @entity125 ( " what an insult to the memory of @entity128 and @entity129 to have disco artists who do n't write their own songs and play their own instruments			1
it 's a sham to have @entity134 and @entity135 and @entity136 in there " ) to @entity139 's suicide ( " i say this respectfully to him -- ' f * * * off ' " ) to , well , pretty much any music made after 1990 other than @entity144 ( " i love her voice " ) and @entity147 ( " a true rock star " )			0
@entity3 itself resembles a less - tacky @entity150 © , and if we were to call the menu fare " unpretentious , " @entity1 would likely be insulted that we used a four - syllable word			1
though the 100 beers on tap appeared to be more of a draw than the food , servers milled about with soft pretzels , pizza , pulled pork , meatballs and fried calamari			0
philosophically , this is food @entity1 considers to be timeless the way " jeans , your leather jacket , your t - shirt " are			1
@entity3 boasts absolutely no pretense whatsoever that this is anything other than brand extension for @entity1			1
@entity1 does n't fancy himself to be a restauranteur and certainly not a connoisseur			2
@entity3 is unabashedly @entity9 and run like a business by a businessman -- " we 'll have 50 in under 2 years and my goal is 500 is 5 years , " @entity1 said			1
" ask @entity180 -- if it 's good , we 'll have two or three on every corner			0
and my track record 's pretty goddamn good			0
