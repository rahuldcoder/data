@entity8 , 57 , is charged with snatching then - 14 - year - old @entity11 at knife - point from her family 's @entity0 home early on june 5 , 2002			1
in court papers , his lawyers have indicated they will raise an insanity defense			2
the three - judge panel vacated the temporary stay it issued thursday , which halted the trial just after the defense had begun its opening statements in a @entity0 federal courtroom			1
the trial will resume monday at 8:30 a.m. , the court said friday			1
defense lawyers asked for a mistrial so the proceedings could be moved to another city , arguing " serious error and irreparable harm " could come because of juror belief in @entity8 's " factual guilt " before hearing any evidence			1
smart is scheduled to be the prosecution 's third witness following her mother , @entity41 , and sister , @entity42			0
@entity11 was abducted before dawn on june 5 , 2002 , and led to a campsite that " was her prison for the next four months , " assistant u.s. attorney @entity43 said in his opening statements thursday			1
she was stripped , dressed in a robe and brought into a tent for an impromptu " wedding			0
" and then , the prosecutor said , she was raped			0
in the months that followed @entity11 's disappearance , her anguished parents , @entity54 and @entity41 , became a familiar sight in the media as they continued to plead for their daughter 's safe return			2
but no one expected what happened in march 2003 , when @entity11 was found walking down a street in the @entity0 suburb of @entity68 in the company of @entity8 and his wife , @entity70			1
@entity8 , a drifter and self - described prophet who called himself @entity72 , had done some handyman work at the @entity75 ' home			2
@entity1 prosecutors charged @entity8 with six felony counts of kidnapping , sexual assault and burglary			1
but in july 2005 , a @entity1 district judge ruled him incompetent to stand trial , leaving him in custody at the @entity84			0
the state case against @entity8 was put on hold when federal authorities stepped in			0
a grand jury in 2008 indicted @entity8 and @entity70			0
judge @entity89 in march found @entity8 competent to stand trial			2
@entity70 , 64 , pleaded guilty in federal court in november 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor and was sentenced in may to 15 years in federal prison			0
she also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap @entity11 's cousin a month after @entity11 was kidnapped			1
she was given a sentence of one to 15 years , to be served concurrently with the federal sentence and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody			0
as part of her plea agreement , @entity70 agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband			0
however , her name does not appear on a witness list filed by federal prosecutors -- and does appear on a list of witnesses filed by the defense			0
@entity8 's attorneys earlier attempted unsuccessfully to move his trial , saying it should be held outside of @entity1 because publicity in the case had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial .			2
