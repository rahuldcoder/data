-- chlorine is supposed to take care of most of the microbes floating around in pools , but human waste , it seems , is stubbornly resistant to being sanitized			0
that 's the conclusion of a group of researchers from the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , who collected water samples from 161 filters in public and private swimming pools , as well as water parks in @entity16 last summer			1
what they found trapped in those filters was enough to make swimmers think twice before logging their laps			0
more than half of the samples were contaminated with @entity24 , which the investigators say comes from one primary source -- swimmers pooping in the pool			1
the study , published in the latest @entity30 , specifically looked at pools in @entity16 , but the researchers say such contamination is likely a widespread problem in @entity36 pools , thanks to swimmers not washing themselves off before taking a dip			1
according to the scientists , each of us carries about 0.14 grams of fecal material into the pool -- and that does n't include accidents or cases of diarrhea			1
among municipal pools , the genetic testing for pathogens detected @entity24 in 70 % of the filters , while 66 % of the water parks contained the bacteria and 49 % of pools in private clubs showed evidence of the contamination			1
" these findings indicate the need for swimmers to help prevent introduction of pathogens , e.g. , taking a pre-swim shower and not swimming when ill with diarrhea , ( for ) aquatics staff to maintain disinfectant level and @entity67 according to public health standards to inactivate pathogens , and state and local environmental health specialists to enforce such standards , " the authors write in their report			0
when a pool is properly chlorinated , however , bacteria like @entity24 should be killed off , since proper ph levels typically take care of the issue			1
according to the @entity10 , it takes less than a minute for @entity24 to be inactivated if chlorine levels are adequate , about 16 minutes to control @entity80 virus , about 45 minutes to kill off the @entity82 parasite and over 10 days for a @entity84 parasite			1
but just one diarrhea accident can cause an infection for anyone who gets a mouth full of pool water			1
fortunately , the testing did not reveal strains of @entity92 , a particularly virulent form of the bacteria that was responsible for several outbreaks , and deaths , from serious foodborne illnesses			2
according to @entity103 , because the researchers only analyzed the samples for genetic signatures of different pathogens , they could n't determine whether the bugs were alive , and potentially reproducing in the water , but there were no pool - related diseases reported in @entity16 during the summer the samples were gathered			1
@entity109 , the ceo of the @entity110 , says that in order to be properly chlorinated , pools should contain 1 - 4 parts per million of chlorine and ph levels should be within 7.2 -- 7.8			0
" you can go to any mass market store and go into the pool chemical aisle and buy test stripes			2
all of these have chlorine and @entity67 tests			0
in five seconds , you can do a quick analysis yourself and have an idea of what the various levels are , " he says			0
but if you do n't have the time to do your own testing , look for clear water			2
" you should always be able to see the bottom of the pool clearly			2
usually if the water is cloudy , something with the filter or chemicals is n't right , " says @entity109			2
" @entity139 water does n't mean everything is alright , but cloudy water is an absolute positive sign that something is not right			2
" here are some additional recommendations from the @entity10 for ensuring a bug - free dip : -- do n't swim when you have diarrhea			1
-- shower with soap before you start swimming			0
-- take a shower to rinse off before you get back into the water			0
-- take bathroom breaks every 60 minutes			0
-- wash your hands after using the toilet or changing diapers			0
-- try not to swallow the pool water			1
if you have young children : -- take children on bathroom breaks every half - hour to hour or check diapers frequently			0
-- change diapers in the bathroom or diaper - changing area and not at poolside where pathogens can rinse into the water			0
there may be no way to completely sanitize a pool , but the latest analysis of what could be lurking in the water should motivate lifeguards and pool managers to be more vigilant about testing those waters more frequently			1
people should outnumber the pathogens in any pool			0

@entity10 researchers find a surprising amount of @entity24 in pool water
the study *focused* on @entity16 , but researchers say it 's likely widespread
proper chlorination can kill @entity24 and other bacteria
