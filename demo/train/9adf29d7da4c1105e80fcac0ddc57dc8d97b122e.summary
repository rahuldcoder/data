-- satellite imagery that may show debris from @entity3 is raising hopes that investigators can narrow what has been a needle - in - a - haystack search operation			1
the images , obtained and analyzed by the @entity9 as " a possible indication of debris south of the search area that has been the focus of the search operation , " according to the @entity15 , were taken above a remote part of ocean thousands of kilometers south - east of @entity18			1
two objects , one of approximately 24 meters ( 78.7 ft ) in length and another around five meters ( 16.4 ft ) long have been spotted , leading to hopes that more information regarding the missing airliner has come to light			2
beforehand , search corridors had extended both through central @entity28 and as far south as the depths of the @entity30			1
the new find gives cause that the search operations can zero in on a much more focused field			2
however , the area of southern @entity30 , 2,350 kilometers ( 1,460 miles ) to the southeast of @entity37 in western @entity18 is a remote , potentially inhospitable area of sea which will not necessarily aid search operations -- @entity18 prime minister @entity42 described the search area friday as the " about the most inaccessible spot you could imagine on the face of the earth			1
" @entity49 's @entity48 illustrated the difficulty of the task ahead			0
" they are saying it 's the most challenging of things			0
it 's far , it 's remote , it 's very deep and you 're in the storm season so it 's inclement there as well ... it 's a tough set of constraints , " he told @entity56			0
the distance from @entity18 means that the search time of aircraft " on station " -- within the reduced search zone -- will be limited to only a couple of hours			0
weather will also potentially be an issue			0
already , the first aircraft on the scene which was dispatched early thursday to assess the site , has reported " poor visibility , " despite " moderate weather conditions , " according to the @entity15 's @entity76 , who spoke at a media briefing thursday			0
" this will hamper both air and satellite efforts , " he said			0
@entity0 meteorologist @entity82 says that weather in the region , especially at this time of year , can be unpredictable			0
" today marks the first day of autumn down under , so it 's not unusual to see the weather in this part of the world start to pick up in intensity			1
" we have very limited ( weather ) info in this remote corner of the planet			1
in fact , it is so remote that ( weather ) satellites are even a bit choppy that far south			2
" a key to the search is the height of the waves and whether there are whitecaps present , former flight commander @entity100 told @entity0 's @entity107			0
" those high waves ... are very disruptive on your search pattern when you 're trying to look for objects in the water			0
" he estimated that the search crews would have a window of three to four days			0
" then from there i do n't see much hope in finding anything in the near term			0
" the average depth in that area of the ocean is around 13,000 feet , which is slightly less than the average depth worldwide			1
the area 's depth could still present significant problems for retrieving wreckage -- should the objects seen on satellite be confirmed as part of the missing plane			1
there are volcanic ridges underwater which rise up from the ocean floor , which can reduce the depth to 3,000 feet			2
also , this part of the @entity30 is the location of the @entity138 , one of five major gyres worldwide			1
a gyre is an area of circular ocean current where water does not circulate particularly freely			2
the @entity138 is known to trap large volumes of debris in the southern @entity30 as currents here are very weak and show little to no movement over long periods of time , @entity82 said			1
however , " at these very high latitudes ( where the debris was spotted ) ... westerly winds are typically very strong and they can certainly impact large - scale debris and move them along , " meaning that wind patterns may have influenced the location of the sighted objects			2
live : latest updates on the missing @entity163 jetliner what can we tell from fresh lead ? if this is the debris , what happens next ? opinion : search for @entity3 highlights need for trust , unity in @entity28			1

satellite images give hope that @entity3 debris may have been spotted
remote part of @entity30 now focus of search
weather and ocean depth might be stumbling *blocks* to search of area
