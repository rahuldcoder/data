@entity1 intelligence leaker @entity0 met with human rights activists and lawyers friday in a transit zone of a @entity6 airport , in his first public appearance since he left @entity8 on june 23			1
the event prompted the @entity10 to criticize @entity6 for giving @entity0 a " propaganda platform , " and later in the day , president @entity12 spoke by phone with @entity6 president @entity14			1
" the two leaders noted the importance of @entity19 - @entity6 bilateral relations and discussed a range of security and bilateral issues , including the status of mr. @entity0 and cooperation on counterterrorism in the lead - up to the @entity27 , " a @entity10 statement said			1
@entity0 told the activists he was requesting asylum from @entity6 while he awaited safe passage to @entity31 , according to a transcript of @entity0 's statement to the activists , issued via @entity35			1
the presidents of @entity37 and @entity38 have said their countries would give him asylum , and @entity42 's president said he would offer it " if circumstances permit			0
" " i announce today my formal acceptance of all offers of support or asylum i have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future , " @entity0 's statement said			1
" as we have seen , however , some governments in @entity53 and @entity1 states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law , and this behavior persists today			0
this unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to @entity31 and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights			2
" meanwhile , @entity19 intelligence agencies are continuing their contacts with their @entity6 counterparts to learn whatever they can about @entity6 's intentions in the @entity0 case , and to press for his return to @entity31 , a @entity19 official told @entity74 on friday			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity75 warned @entity6 about providing asylum to @entity0 and criticized the country for " providing a propaganda platform " to @entity0			1
but @entity75 added the administration did n't want the case to cause undue harm to @entity19 relations with @entity83			0
that platform " runs counter to the @entity6 government 's previous declarations of @entity6 's neutrality and that they have no control over his presence in the airport , " he said			1
" it is also incompatible with @entity6 assurances that they do not want mr. @entity0 to further damage @entity19 interests			1
" @entity0 , a former @entity98 contractor , is believed to have been holed up in a transit area of @entity83 's @entity100 since leaving @entity8 for @entity6			1
in an invitation to the meeting purportedly e-mailed by @entity0 on thursday , he cited the temporary grounding of @entity38 president @entity105 ' plane last week as he accused the @entity19 of " threatening behavior " on an unprecedented scale			2
the jet , which had left @entity83 , was forced to land in @entity109 after other @entity53 countries allegedly closed their airspace amid suspicions that @entity0 was aboard			2
@entity0 said he was submitting a request to @entity6 for asylum friday " until such time as these states accede to law and my legal travel is permitted			1
" but the head of the @entity6 @entity120 , @entity121 , told @entity6 news agency @entity123 saturday that no application from @entity0 had yet been received			1
" if we receive an application , it will be considered in due process of law , " @entity121 is quoted as saying			0
' i have no regrets ' in his remarks , @entity0 also sought to defend his actions in leaking documents to the media that exposed @entity19 mass surveillance programs			1
" i did what i believed right and began a campaign to correct this wrongdoing			0
i did not seek to enrich myself			0
i did not seek to sell @entity19 secrets			0
i did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety			0
instead , i took what i knew to the public , so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day , and i asked the world for justice , " he said			0
" that moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly , but it was the right thing to do and i have no regrets			0
" @entity0 asked the rights groups present to lobby the @entity6 government to grant him temporary asylum , said @entity6 @entity160 representative @entity159 , who was at the meeting			1
according to @entity35 , @entity159 told @entity0 that on her way to the airport , she received a call from the @entity19 ambassador to @entity6			1
he asked her to relay to @entity0 that the @entity19 government does not consider him to be a whistle - blower and that he has broken @entity19 law , the group said			1
a photograph provided by a @entity6 @entity160 staffer at the meeting showed @entity0 sitting behind a desk , flanked by a @entity35 staffer , looking much as he did when last photographed in @entity8			1
@entity35 , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website , has been aiding @entity0 in his bids for asylum			1
@entity6 television aired an amateur video of @entity0 delivering remarks to the activists			1
" a little over one month ago , i had family , a home in paradise , and i lived in great comfort			0
i also had the capability without any warrant to search for , seize , and read your communications			0
anyone 's communications at any time			0
that is the power to change people 's fates			0
it is also a serious violation of the law , " he said			0
" the immoral can not be made moral through the use of secret law			0
i believe in the principle declared at @entity205 in 1945 : individuals have international duties which transcend the national obligations of obedience			0
therefore individual citizens have the duty to violate domestic laws to prevent crimes against peace and humanity from occurring , " @entity0 said			2
@entity6 asylum conditions ? @entity0 's desire to be granted temporary asylum in @entity6 may represent something of a turnaround			1
he last week reportedly withdrew an asylum request with @entity6 authorities after president @entity14 said he would have to " stop his work aimed at harming our @entity1 partners " if he wanted to stay in the country			1
" @entity0 did voice a request to remain in @entity6 , " @entity230 spokesman @entity229 said on july 2 , according to the @entity6 news agency @entity231			1
" then , yesterday , hearing president @entity14 outline @entity6 's position regarding the conditions under which he could do this , he withdrew his request for permission to stay in @entity6			1
" it 's not clear if a request for temporary asylum would entail different conditions			0
but a @entity6 lawmaker who was at friday 's meeting , @entity244 , told state news agency @entity245 that @entity0 had said he did not intend to cause any further damage to the @entity19			1
" i 've said all i knew and i will not harm the @entity19 in the future , " @entity0 said , according to @entity244			2
the @entity19 has reached out to the @entity6 regarding @entity0 's meeting with human rights groups , two senior @entity249 officials told @entity74			1
passport revoked @entity0 has been technically a free man while in @entity83 but has been unable to travel after @entity19 authorities revoked his passport when he was charged with espionage			2
the many mysteries of @entity0 's transit zone @entity258 , head of @entity260 's @entity83 office , who was at the meeting , said he was pleased to voice the organization 's support for @entity0 in person			2
" we will continue to pressure governments to ensure his rights are respected -- this includes the unassailable right to claim asylum wherever he may choose , " he said in a statement			2
" what he has disclosed is patently in the public interest and as a whistle - blower his actions were justified			0
" @entity0 exposed unlawful sweeping surveillance programs , and states that try to prevent him from revealing such unlawful behavior " are flouting international law , " @entity258 said			2
" instead of addressing or even owning up to these blatant breaches , the @entity19 government is more intent on persecuting him			0
attempts to pressure governments to block his efforts to seek asylum are deplorable , " he said			0
@entity289 , human rights program director for the @entity290 , said the @entity19 has a long history of supporting asylum rights , but in the case of @entity0 , it " has improperly interfered with the right of asylum by revoking his passport and exerting extraordinary pressure on countries to reject his requests			1
" @entity0 's claims for asylum deserve fair consideration , and @entity19 actions to secure his extradition must take place within an acceptable legal framework protecting his right to seek asylum			1
" @entity19 accused of ' unlawful campaign ' the transit zone meeting with @entity0 began at around 5 p.m. local time ( 9 a.m. et )			2
a @entity74 team at the airport saw about half a dozen people -- including @entity6 's human rights ombudsman and representatives of @entity260 , @entity160 and @entity6 human rights groups -- enter a door marked " private " in @entity320 and security officers then kept the media at a distance			1
the letter purportedly e-mailed by @entity0 to invite them to the meeting blasted the @entity19 for carrying out illegal actions against him			0
in the letter -- posted on the @entity330 page of @entity331 , the @entity6 @entity160 staffer -- the writer praised the " brave countries " that have offered him support , in the face of what he described as " an unlawful campaign by officials in the @entity19 government to deny my right to seek and enjoy this asylum			2
" in her @entity330 post , @entity331 said she received the e-mailed invitation close to 5 p.m. thursday and acknowledged that she did not know beforehand if it was real			0
a large group of @entity6 and international journalists gathered at the airport in anticipation of the meeting			2
@entity31 asylum offers since his arrival in @entity83 , @entity0 -- who faces espionage charges in the @entity19 -- has requested asylum in dozens of countries , sparking a surge in speculation about his next steps			2
is @entity0 worth the risk ? @entity31 weighs the pros and cons @entity0 has admitted releasing classified documents about @entity19 surveillance programs to the media and argues that he did so to expose serious violations of the @entity19 @entity368			2
he is slammed as a traitor by critics and hailed as a hero by his supporters			0
@entity35 said in a @entity374 post wednesday that @entity0 's " flight of liberty " campaign was starting , promising further details			0
but details about where @entity0 is going -- and how he 'll get there -- have remained hard to come by			0
@entity19 officials told @entity384 officials in @entity385 this week that they 're disappointed with the way @entity384 and @entity8 handled the @entity0 case , saying their actions undermined trust			0
@entity384 said that @entity8 authorities acted in accordance with the law .			0
