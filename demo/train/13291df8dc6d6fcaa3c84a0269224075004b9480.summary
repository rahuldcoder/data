-- when was the last time you adjusted your business strategy based on @entity5 's changing consumer behavior ? with economic growth , comes consumer maturity			1
@entity5 's emerging consumers are becoming more independent , confident and connected			1
like all of us , @entity5 's consumers are changing not only demographically and geographically , they are adjusting to choice			1
much of that choice is emerging in the world of e-commerce			2
there are nearly 600 million netizens in @entity5 and they are beginning to aggressively shop online			1
the challenge for online commerce outlets is to define just who their customers are and how they make their purchase decisions			1
in other words , what influences them to spend money online ? what we do know is that men shop differently than women , even when it comes to online purchases			0
for example , we know that men tend to be more , let 's call it , goal oriented when they shop online			0
but they also tend to buy things specifically for themselves			0
that said , both sexes are looking for two key things : lower prices and greater convenience			0
@entity46 's 2012 annual report on online shopping behaviors of @entity5 consumers showed that for a couple of key categories covered in the survey , men were more active than women in online shopping			1
eighty percent of male respondents , ( vs. 59 % of female respondents ) went online for consumer electronics purchases , while 71 % of male respondents , ( vs. 66 % of female respondents ) went online to purchase services			0
with more people shopping on the @entity63 , we are also seeing online shoppers increasingly becoming impatient as they shop			0
if they ca n't easily find what they want , they quickly move on			0
they want to shop on their terms and their timelines			0
so , how do we ensure online shopping is embedded in the broader internet experience for @entity5 's online consumers ? according to the survey , 66 % of connected consumers were both microblog and social networking site users			1
the implication for brands would be to use their microblog presence as information delivery centers to combine and bring together all other digital platforms such as a company website , campaign mini-site , social networking brand page and viral video content			2
with the high penetration of smart phones , e-commerce evolves a step further to m - commerce			2
we can see that consumers are n't even waiting to get back home to switch on their computers and start spending			0
consumers want to browse and shop whenever they want -- on the subway , while waiting for friends , or even during meal times			0
engaging with mobile users is critical in this and most other markets			0
unlike @entity108 's dominant position in the @entity109 , there are many big scale e-commerce players competing fiercely in @entity5 , so it might take more time for a standout leader to emerge			1
for now , existing e-commerce players face expensive challenges surrounding logistics and pricing			2
some are also grappling with aligning online and offline shopping experiences			2
flexible shopping and delivery / pick - up options are proving popular , particularly when combined with smart promotions across online and offline platforms			0
satisfied customers with successful online purchases are likely to drive more sales as consumers share positive experiences via social media			1
a @entity46 survey found 85 % of @entity5 consumers regularly used social media to share their experiences with online purchases			1
as retailers look to align and grow their offline and online businesses , the challenge is how to develop successful marketing strategies for the sophisticated @entity5 consumer : 1			1
earn trust -- create a trusted environment with your customers and make them feel valued			1
every brand should take some time to understand the specific online networks with which their customers engage and to become a part of it			2
leveraging trusted experts or appropriate celebrities in @entity5 has also been successful in building trust			1
the bottom line is that emotion is the key			0
in a world where the consumer sees hundreds of advertisements in the span of just one day , triggering an emotional response is proven to give your product or brand the attention and recognition it needs to stand out			0
from there , you build brand dependency ; success here will take care of itself as consumers will recommend the product to others			0
get connected - @entity5 online shoppers are primarily young and educated consumers who are seeking value and convenience			2
offering unique product assortments online and giving the consumer multiple convenient options for payment and delivery are also likely to resonate with these shoppers			0
communications - again , social media is a powerful communication platform that is looked at multiple times a day			1
e-commerce and online shopping flip the traditional store - to - consumer , one - way conversation			2
consumers are now searching out retailer websites for specific products and learning about goods via social media			1
retailers need to engage in this social conversation and interact with @entity5 's tech - savvy consumers who are increasingly open to boosting e-commerce spending			1
it is also suggested that an integrated online / offline campaign can double your brand 's recall .			0
