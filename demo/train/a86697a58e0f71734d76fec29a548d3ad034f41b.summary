-- @entity1 is no surprise in the @entity3 and northern @entity4 in winter			2
but a blizzard ? that 's something different -- and dangerous			2
that 's especially a concern when it threatens @entity11 , with more than 8 million residents and legions of visitors perhaps still stumbling home from @entity16 after the @entity17 dropped on @entity18			1
as of wednesday night , @entity11 was under a winter storm warning , just like many other densely populated communities in parts of eight states			1
a stone 's throw away in neighboring @entity25 -- including in @entity26 , which borders @entity11 -- the @entity27 has issued a blizzard warning from 6 p.m. thursday through 1 p.m. friday because of a forecast marked by 8 to 10 inches of snow , wind chills dipping to 10 - below zero and sustained winds up to 35 mph and gusting 10 mph stronger than that			1
" falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely , " the @entity27 said			1
" this will lead to whiteout conditions making travel extremely dangerous			0
" even if it does n't officially get socked with a blizzard -- which meteorologists define as three hours or longer of 35 mph winds or more and considerable snow -- @entity11 should come close			1
its forecast calls for about 9 inches of snow , subzero wind chills and winds regularly blowing between 21 and 26 mph , which could test newly inaugurated mayor @entity49			1
by sheer numbers , other cities are predicted to have it worse			0
@entity53 , @entity11 , could shudder at lows of 11 below and some 14 inches of snow			1
@entity57 's temperatures alone ( not just the wind chill ) should be minus 3 on friday night , by which time the @entity59 should have 5 to 11 inches of flakes on the ground			1
two days ahead of time , due to the storm , the city called off school for friday			2
citing likely " near blizzard " conditions thursday night into late friday morning , the @entity66 warned that 1 to 2 feet of fluffy , drifting snow could accumulate in some pockets and that there could be moderate coastal flooding			1
the combination of everything -- especially the extreme cold and strong winds -- has homeless shelters at the ready , knowing there may be more people needing their help			1
@entity81 , for example , expects a number of people will end up sleeping on its floors over the coming days			2
" our main emphasis is getting people inside where it is safer and warmer , " said @entity85 , a spokeswoman for the @entity87 shelter system in @entity57 , where a snow emergency has been declared			1
" ... @entity94 is making sure to have extra staff and food and water			0
we are geared up to provide to a greater number of people			0
" already , wintry weather was hitting parts of the @entity102 on wednesday night in the form of snow in @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			2
the weather contributed to nearly 600 flight cancellations in and out of @entity110 's @entity109 -- more than half the total for all the @entity112 , according to airline tracking website @entity113 -- and it should get worse , with 5 to 9 inches of snow forecast for thursday			1
and parts of the northern @entity112 should get even colder , somehow , as the week rolls along			0
@entity117 's beloved @entity117 will welcome the @entity118 to @entity119 , where low temperatures could bottom out sunday night around at minus 17			0
it will be relatively balmy sunday in @entity122 , @entity123 , but potentially a lot wetter with snow and rain possible when the city 's @entity126 host the @entity128 in another @entity130 playoff match - up			0
of course , while the players might not have a choice , fans do n't have to brave the cold for either game			0
the big worries are for those who travel in the coming days			0
authorities in @entity11 , for example , say they may shut down the @entity140 if whiteout conditions make driving along the east - west highway too perilous			2
@entity143 is n't taking any chances , nor is he predicting a world - ending storm			0
the @entity11 said that he plans to sit tight and let @entity147 do her thing			2
" there 's not much you can do , " said @entity143			0
" when it 's snowing and these streets lock up , there 's really no where you can go , so it 's best to just stay in			0
" @entity0 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
