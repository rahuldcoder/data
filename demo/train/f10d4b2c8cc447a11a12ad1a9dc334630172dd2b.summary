ever wished you could clamber aboard your cumbersome luggage to zoom down a hill or coast through an airport ? driven by the same desire , @entity6 frequent flier @entity5 has come up with the answer -- a foot - powered scooter - suitcase known as @entity10			1
" the idea comes from having to catch the next connection flight in three minutes when the gate is on the other side of the world and you need to move faster than those moving walkways , " @entity5 tells @entity11			1
disappointed with available luggage solutions to this problem , @entity5 used his background as an automotive engineer and his time waiting for flights to sketch up an alternative			1
now , after three years of " testing , testing , testing , " and a soon - to - finish fundraising campaign on @entity31 , the @entity26 is ready to hit the streets			1
it 's available in three models : an airline - approved carry - on suitcase with a built - in kick scooter ; a backpack with kick scooter and a kick scooter that can carry another bag			1
all three feature wheely suitcase - style collapsible handles and can double up as a hand trolleys			0
' @entity45 ' @entity5 , who describes himself as a " hardcore engineering guy , " says he grew up preferring scooters to skateboards because he liked being able to control the speed			2
needless to say , his suitcase scooters are all fitted with brakes			0
even with this sensible feature , @entity5 says travelers in some parts of the world may be wary to step aboard			2
" what we learned is the typical reaction in @entity60 was ' oh cool , i want to have one , but how will i look ? people are staring at me			0
' " this is the problem in @entity60 , people do n't want to stand out from the crowd			0
for sure , it 's not for the shy ones			0
" @entity10 clearly has considerable appeal though			2
with the final hours ticking down , @entity69 - based @entity26 's @entity31 campaign has raised well in excess of its $ 27,000 target			1
the scooter - suitcase , it seems , is already on a roll .			0

@entity6 frequent flier @entity5 's @entity26 suitcase can also be ridden as a scooter
@entity5 has raised *investment* in his *concept* via the @entity31 funding *platform*
