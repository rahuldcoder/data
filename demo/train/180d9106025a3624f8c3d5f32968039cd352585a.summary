-- most sporting winners like to achieve champion status by proving their worth in the heat of battle but @entity7 's @entity6 had the cold to thank after he was all but guaranteed a second straight overall @entity8 in @entity9 on thursday			1
a combination of snow , wind and fog caused the cancellation of thursday 's @entity15 in @entity16 , just a day after the downhill was scrapped for similar reasons , all of which prompted @entity6 's chief rival @entity21 to withdraw from this weekend 's slalom			1
the @entity23 had hoped to narrow @entity6 's lead of 149 points in the two events he excels in but @entity21 's @entity8 hopes became decidedly frosty after these were canceled - since the @entity7 is more adroit at the slalom			1
" i see no point in competing in the slalom now , " said the overall champion in 2007 and 2009			2
" it might have been a consideration had the two races not been canceled			0
but that has not been the case			0
" @entity21 's decision to miss sunday 's season - ending slalom means he can not overhaul @entity6 's lead , with only 100 points awarded to the winner of any race			1
slalom is not his strong point , with the 30 - year - old having never done better than finish sixth in a @entity8 race in the discipline			2
disappointed by his failure to pits his wits on the slope , the speedy @entity21 was nonetheless quick to praise @entity6 -- classifying the @entity7 in the same bracket as some of the best skiers in history			1
" he had a fantastic season , worthy of great skiers of the past like ( @entity59 's @entity58 or ( @entity61 's @entity60 , " added the @entity23			1
even though he was disappointed by the cancellation of thursday 's races , the move did confirm @entity21 as the winner of this year 's super g. the day went badly for organizers with an initial delay of over three hours for bad weather followed by another postponement after the first racer , @entity72 , fell in high winds			1
nine racers managed to finish despite the gusting winds before @entity78 , last year 's downhill @entity8 winner , crashed at the same spot as @entity80 fell before being flown to hospital after 45 minutes of on course treatment for a broken shoulder			2
@entity6 told reporters it was difficult to celebrate his impending triumph on a day when his fellow @entity7 , who received a tweet of support from his compatriot , had been so badly injured			2
" despite my young age , i 've already learned many things			0
in life , being slalom world champion is not the most important thing , " the 24 - year - old said in philosophical fashion			0
" there are things that surpass that -- such as my family , @entity102 ( his girlfriend ) , my friends and being healthy			0
" @entity105 was another left with mixed emotions , despite the fact that the @entity108 took her third crystal globe of the season on thursday , adding the super g to the overall and giant slalom cups			1
this came just 24 hours after she lost out on the @entity8 downhill crown to @entity116 's @entity115 in similar fashion , with bad fog canceling the race with the @entity108 trailing by just a single point			1
" i do n't really like this kind of days when you do n't get the chance to show your skills on the slope , " she told the official @entity123 website			0
" but in the end today is a good day for me , while yesterday was n't really			0
i 'm of course happy to secure the @entity15 title			2
i 'm really proud of my season			0
" " i 'm relieved that we did n't race today			0
in my opinion speed events should be canceled before one o'clock			0
waiting for too long puts you in a stressful position and the risk of accidents therefore becomes higher			0
" maze can add the slalom globe to her trophy cabinet on sunday , with the action at the @entity8 finals week continuing on friday with the team parallel racing event -- weather permitting of course .			1
