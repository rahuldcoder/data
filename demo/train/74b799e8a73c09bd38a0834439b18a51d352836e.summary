@entity0 -- three weeks ago , a man behaving strangely in a city subway station in @entity0 attracted the attention of police , fearing he may be a terrorist plotting a train attack			2
when police searched him , they found he was engaged in terror of another kind -- a camera rigged into the sole of his shoe carried pictures into a hard drive strapped to his thigh , according to local press reports			0
the suspect was a video voyeur , rigged to take shots up women 's skirts			0
" we saw the man walking suspiciously and weirdly , " @entity24 , a senior inspector at the police 's railway district , told the @entity27			0
" he was later seen stalking a woman with his leg lifted up			0
" @entity0 police have arrested 38 people for " up - skirt " photo taking on the city 's @entity35 , or @entity35 , during the first half of this year			1
while that 's down slightly from the 41 arrested during the same period last year , the incident shows how sexual predators are using technology to become more creative in their criminal activity			1
" some offenders [ commit ] ' photo under skirt ' crimes by attempting to hide their activities by concealing pinhole cameras inside bags , newspapers , and even shoes which they then activate by way of connecting hand operated leads in their pockets , " a press officer from the @entity57 told @entity1			2
professor @entity58 , director of the @entity59 at the @entity60 , says these criminals are not opportunists , such as criminals who grope women on crowded trains ; rather , they are executing planned attacks			0
" the culprits of this type of crime do tend to plan , are creative in their efforts and are generally repeat offenders			2
there are many websites containing pictures of this type of material , some faked but some real so there is obviously a demand for those types of images , " she said			0
depending on what crime offenders taking " up - skirt " photos are convicted of , loitering or disorder in public places , they face a maximum fine of either hk $ 10,000 ( $ 1,283 ) or hk $ 5,000 ( $ 642 ) and a prison sentence of six months or one year , respectively			1
indecent assault such as groping , on the other hand , carries a sentence of 10 years in prison			0
@entity94 statistics show that in the first half of 2011 there were 68 reported cases of indecent assault on the @entity35 , compared with 72 during the same time period in 2010			1
" police deploy a combination of both uniform and plainclothes officers in the railway system in order to provide a high profile overt visual deterrence as well as a covert presence designed to catch offenders in the act , particularly during the busy rush hour periods , " a police press officer said			0
police say most indecent assault and " up - skirt " photos taken on the @entity35 occur in train compartments and on escalators during rush hour			1
dr. @entity58 noted that " the crowded conditions , the anonymity and ease of escape are all factors " that makes this environment attractive to predators			2
in order to deal with the problem of sexual assaults on public transportation , many cities have implemented train compartments reserved for female passengers only			1
some public transit systems in @entity133 began offering " women - only " train cars a decade ago to " prevent groping and other problematic behavior , " and to create a sense of safety , according to the @entity140 website			1
@entity141 is implementing a similar system in the near future in response to a 77 % increase in sexual crimes between 2009 and 2010 , according to the @entity147			1
other countries , like @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152 have also introduced some form of segregated public transportation to deal with harassment			0
in january @entity0 's @entity156 debated the issue of introducing female - only subways cars to the city			1
the @entity160 continues to actively campaign for female - only passenger cars			1
but @entity162 , executive secretary of the association for the @entity164 of @entity165 , doubted the effectiveness of segregated passenger cars saying their existence may lead to women who ride in non-segregated cars to be blamed if they are harassed			0
" in countries who have [ female only subway cars ] , there are not enough cars , especially during the rush hour			2
females are forced to ride in the normal cars			0
if they are harassed people say , ' why did n't you use the special car ? ' " she said .			2

sexual predators are using technology to become more creative in their criminal activity
in the first half of 2011 , 38 people were arrested for " up - skirt " photos on the @entity35
