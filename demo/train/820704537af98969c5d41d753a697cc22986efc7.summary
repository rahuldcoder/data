-- all that stood between @entity2 and the thrill - promising roller coaster was a seat belt			1
if he could just buckle it , he and his children would zoom to 53 miles an hour in the first three seconds			1
there was just one problem : @entity2 was too big			1
he had to step out and go tell his wife he weighed too much , while his kids blasted off on the ride without him			1
" from there , we kind of made a saying : ' the walk of shame , ' " he said			2
" i realized at that time i was just too big			2
" incidents such as this prompted @entity2 , 42 , of @entity20 , to finally take action against his weight			1
since september 2012 , he has dropped 125 pounds			1
" it 's not easy			2
you did n't get big overnight , so it 's going to take a little time , " @entity2 tells others who want to follow his lead			1
" it 's going to take some work			2
you just got to decide for yourself that 's what you want			2
" sorority girl drops 107 pounds getting motivated at 5 - foot - 3 , @entity2 , who works in maintenance at an office building , describes himself as a " short , round person			1
" but it was n't always that way			2
he was initially a skinny child , but he gained a lot of weight between the second and third grades			2
that summer , he stayed home and watched tv and ate			2
other children made fun of him , calling him " sheep dog " and " fat boy			2
" @entity2 knew the health risks of being overweight			1
he has always been diligent about annual physicals because his father 's siblings died of cardiovascular problems , and his father has had a heart attack			2
yet @entity2 remained healthy in adulthood by other measures			1
his blood pressure and cholesterol were fine , so he never consistently weighed himself			2
he thinks he reached 300 pounds in his 40s			1
" i thought i did n't need to lose weight because i 'm healthy , " he said			2
at one annual physical , @entity2 's doctor told him he still needed to lose weight and that he was " very lucky " to have normal vital signs , but they would n't necessarily stay that way			1
the doctor said , @entity2 remembers , " you 're going to be in a world of hurt			1
" but the message did n't make a dent in @entity2 's unhealthy habits until last august , when he decided to race his youngest daughter for one mile			1
he thought he would finish in about 10 minutes			1
he estimates he weighed between 310 and 320 pounds at that point			1
" it was horrible , " he said			2
" it took me 22 minutes to do a mile			1
" and because of poor route planning , @entity2 could n't make it back ; he had to call his wife to pick him up			1
the next day , he told his wife : no more sodas			2
it was time for a change			2
how diet bloggers stay thin tailored for larger bodies a big help to @entity2 's weight loss effort was the arrival of a new gym , @entity92 , behind his workplace			1
the facility is specifically geared toward overweight and obese people , and their equipment and workouts are tailored for larger bodies			1
@entity2 did n't realize before going to this gym that he could modify challenging exercises , such as push - ups and jumping jacks , to accommodate his fitness level			1
he also liked that everyone there had the same goal : weight loss			2
there were no perfectly toned bodybuilders in sight			2
the gym made exercise personal			1
he 'd get calls from employees asking what time he 'd be showing up			0
" i was n't just a number there , " he said			0
" they knew what level i was at			0
they pushed me to my limits			0
" now , @entity2 works out five times a week			1
he runs four times every week , a total of at least 20 miles , and does weights twice a week			0
he 's also a personal trainer at @entity92 , helping others reach their goals			0
to help his physical transformation , @entity2 made drastic changes to his eating habits			1
" before , my range of food was : @entity134 , pizza , something fried , " @entity2 said			1
now , processed foods are strictly forbidden			0
he eats a lot of fruits and vegetables , grilled chicken and grilled fish			0
when he drinks sweet tea , he dilutes his serving to 75 % water			0
of course , he still splurges on one guilty pleasure now and then : the @entity147 at @entity148			0
the journey has n't always been easy			0
during his running and training earlier this year , he tore a meniscus in his left knee			0
" i was scared to death -- if i could n't work out , the old me would pop back out , " he said			0
his surgery was on a thursday			0
by monday , he was back at the gym , working on his upper body , chest and shoulders			1
two weeks later , he was walking on the treadmills			0
at three weeks , he was able to jog , and by the fourth week , he could run again			0
opinion : is being fat a disease ? measuring success beyond the numbers on the scale , @entity2 has seen many benefits to his weight loss			1
remember how he agonized over a running a mile in 22 minutes in august 2012 ? in june , he ran a @entity170 ( 3.1 miles ) in under 28 minutes			1
after he crossed the finish line and saw his time , " i just started crying , " he remembers			0
" i just kept walking and thinking about where i came from			0
" at his job , he 's noticed a change as well			0
he 's always had to be on his feet all day , but because of his weight , he used to avoid tasks involving standing on ladders and leaning or reaching -- he was scared he would fall			0
" now , i 'm like a little ninja up there , " he said			0
" i can reach over , and i do n't care about falling no more			0
" weight loss contests at @entity92 proved lucrative for @entity2			1
he originally had no intention of winning the first round , from september to december , but when he learned he was close , he stepped up his workout to four hours a day , five times a week			0
that earned him $ 7,000			0
the january to june phase , which came with a $ 20,000 prize , was an incentive to keep going with his weight - loss efforts			1
after winning , he paid off his truck and bought his wife a nice camera ; the rest is in savings			0
he has since kept off the weight , but the gym wo n't be doing more of these contests , a spokeswoman said			1
best friends lose nearly 300 pounds together keeping it off @entity2 has several more goals to keep himself motivated			1
right now , he 's training for a half - marathon that takes place september 14 , and in october he 'll do a sprint triathlon			0
his goal for next year is a half @entity207			0
he also wants to help the rest of his family get fit			0
@entity2 has issued a challenge : they 're all going to run a @entity212 together in december			1
" i do n't want to be a hypocrite to my kids and saying , ' you 've got to lose weight now , ' " he said			0
" but i am going to challenge them to do this one thing for me			0
i think they 're going to like the results			0
" next month , the family is going back to the same amusement park -- @entity223 in @entity224 -- where @entity2 had to give up his seat on a roller coaster last summer			1
trying to buckle the seat belt then led to unexpected twists and turns in his life			0
now , he 's ready to experience the full ride			0
