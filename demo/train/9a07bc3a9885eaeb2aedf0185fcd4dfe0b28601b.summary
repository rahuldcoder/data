@entity0 -- on march 25 , 1863 , in the heat of the @entity3 , pvt. @entity4 and six other @entity6 soldiers received the @entity7 for going 200 miles behind enemy lines to hijack a @entity10 train			1
he became the first @entity13 service member to receive the medal			2
@entity4 survived the @entity3 and , according to several websites , went on to become a cabinetmaker			2
fast - forward to september 17 , 2009 , when @entity20 first class @entity18 was awarded the @entity7 for heroics in @entity22			1
president @entity23 handed the medal to @entity18 's parents , because @entity18 died earning his medal			2
of the @entity27 awarded since @entity4 received his , only 619 have been awarded posthumously , according to the @entity28			1
but in the past four decades , posthumous @entity7 ceremonies have become the rule rather than the exception			2
for all the military actions since the end of the @entity34 , only eight @entity27 have been awarded : two for the " @entity37 " incident in @entity36 , four for @entity38 and two for the war in @entity22 , the longest war in @entity13 history			1
none was given for @entity44 in @entity45 , the fighting in the @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 or the marine barracks bombing in @entity51			0
all eight of those medals were awarded posthumously			1
it 's something the @entity55 wanted to change , and friday , the @entity56 said @entity23 called staff sgt. @entity57 to tell him he will soon receive the familiar gold star medal on a light blue ribbon			1
@entity57 is being recognized for risking his life to save a fellow soldier who had been captured by the @entity62			0
@entity57 survived battle and is alive and well to attend the @entity56 ceremony to receive the medal			1
last year , defense secretary @entity66 was asked about the lack of a living @entity7 recipient			2
" this has been a source of real concern to me , " @entity66 said at the time			0
on friday , @entity73 , the secretary 's spokesman , said @entity66 was " delighted that someone who survived his act of heroism will be honored			1
" gates probably will call @entity57 next week to congratulate him			0
perhaps the reason there are so few living @entity7 recipients is that there have been so few recipients at all			2
compare the eight @entity27 that have been awarded for heroism in the last 40 years with @entity85 , when the battle of @entity87 produced 27 such medals and 15 men were honored for heroism during the attack on @entity92			1
last year , marine corps commandant @entity93 explained one reason why the medal has become more rare			2
" the rules have n't changed ; the rules and the requirements are still the same , " he said			2
" i think it has something to do with the level of intensity of the conflict , " @entity93 said			0
" if you go back and look at some of the fights that took place in @entity34 , @entity109 , @entity85 , there were massive numbers of troops involved in massive engagements over a period of days			0
that 's not the type of conflict that we are seeing in a type of counterinsurgency in @entity45 and @entity22			0
" " so i think that 's perhaps the single most determining factor here as you look at awarding or not awarding a medal , " @entity93 said			0
it is also important to note that when the @entity7 was authorized by @entity126 ( which is why it 's often called the @entity7 , because the president presents it on behalf of @entity126 ) , it was only one of two medals a soldier could earn			1
the other was the @entity131 , which goes to soldiers wounded or killed in combat			0
since then , the @entity134 , the @entity135 , the @entity136 and numerous other awards have been created			0
so a service member 's heroism may well be recognized with a medal , just not the @entity7			1
in some ways , no one wants to see any more @entity27 awarded			1
" you do n't want your soldiers to be put in that situation to where any of them have to rise to the occasion , " @entity143 , an @entity28 veteran who earned the @entity7 in @entity34 , told @entity1 last year			1
" any time a soldier or a @entity154 wins the medal , then his unit is in extremis , and he 's doing very heroic things ... to make that situation better			0
i do n't want to wish that on anybody			0
" but if there are heroes , all agree they should be recognized , and now one hero will be there to hear the applause and shake the president 's hand			0
one day before the @entity56 announced the award for @entity57 , the administration said it will also award the @entity7 to staff sgt. @entity171 , who saved the lives of his fellow soldiers and 15 @entity175 troops			1
@entity171 's award will be given to his parents			0
@entity171 died saving those lives .			0

@entity28 says of *3,467* @entity27 awarded , only 619 were awarded posthumously
recently , more of the medals granted posthumously ; @entity55 wanted that changed
soon , staff *sergeant* who survived his act of heroism will receive the medal
*narrower* recent conflicts , *addition* of other medals may have cut @entity7 awards
