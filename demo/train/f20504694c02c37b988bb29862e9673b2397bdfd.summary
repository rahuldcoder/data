@entity0 -- @entity2 declared a @entity4 poet persona non grata sunday in an unusual move that follows a wave of fury over a controversial poem			1
published in the @entity4 paper @entity12 on wednesday under the title " what needs to be said , " the poem by @entity10 accused @entity2 of planning a preemptive strike against @entity16 in order to " extinguish the @entity16 people			1
" it said @entity2 's " atomic power endangers " world peace			0
the poem also criticized the @entity4 government for supplying @entity2 with a submarine capable of sending destructive warheads " where the existence of a single nuclear bomb is unproven			0
" the 84 - year - old grass , who won a @entity30 in literature in 1999 , is now unwelcome in @entity2 , the government announced			0
the poem earned him a blaze of harsh critics that included @entity2 prime minister @entity37			0
in a statement published thursday , @entity37 referred to @entity10 ' comparison between @entity2 and @entity16 as " shameful " and argued that it said " little about @entity2 and much about mr. @entity10			1
" " it is @entity16 , not @entity2 , that is a threat to the peace and security of the world " said @entity37 , " it is @entity16 , not @entity2 , that threatens other states with annihilation			1
" referring to @entity10 ' past as a member of the @entity51 during @entity52 , @entity37 said " it is not surprising " for the poet " to cast the one and only jewish state as the greatest threat to world peace and to oppose giving @entity2 the means to defend itself			1
" in an effort to quash the criticism and accusations of anti-semitism , @entity10 later explained himself in an interview , saying he merely meant to point to what he considers wrongful policies of the current @entity2 government led by @entity37			2
" i criticize a policy that continues to build settlements against any @entity70 resolution , " @entity10 said			0
" @entity10 ' poems are an attempt to ignite the flame of hatred against the people and the state of @entity2 and thereby promote the idea he was publicly a part of when he wore the @entity81 uniforms , " @entity2 interior minister @entity71 said on sunday			1
" if @entity10 wishes to proceed with his distorted and false creations , i suggest he does so in @entity16 , where he can find a supporting audience , " @entity71 added			2
@entity71 's spokesman told @entity1 the travel ban against @entity10 was issued on the basis of an @entity2 law that enables the government to deny former nazis from entering the country			2
@entity2 foreign minister @entity93 said on sunday the poem is " an expression of the cynicism of some the @entity98 's intellectuals , who , for publicity purposes and the desire to sell a few more books , are willing to sacrifice the @entity103 nation a second time on the altar of crazy anti-semites			0

@entity10 ' poem accused @entity2 of wanting to " extinguish the @entity16 people "
