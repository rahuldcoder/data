-- best - selling author @entity1 is having , by all accounts , a great week			1
she won the @entity3 for her novel " @entity4			1
" she made a deal with @entity6 to potentially turn the book into a tv series , and she won a spot on @entity11 's 100 most influential list			1
@entity0 talked to the author about her success			2
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : congratulations on your @entity3			1
it 's a well - deserved honor			1
what were you doing when you received the news ? @entity21 : i was just sitting down to lunch at a neighborhood restaurant when i heard the news			1
my first reaction was flat - out disbelief			2
i kept asking my publicist , " are you sure ? " it seemed impossible that a scrappy book like " @entity31 " could win an award like that			1
it 's such an iconic honor			2
i think what the @entity3 means to me is that i 'll need to work very , very hard to try to live up to it			1
@entity0 : how did " @entity31 " come about ? what was the genesis or idea that inspired you to write your latest award - winning novel ? @entity21 : the entry point for me was very much what it is for the reader ; i was in a hotel bathroom , looked down and saw a wallet lying exposed in a woman 's bag			1
i 've had my wallet stolen many times and ways in my life -- through carelessness , oblivion or just plain being a sucker -- and when i saw that wallet , i thought , " oh , no ! someone will take it ! " since i was the only person in a position to so , my mind made one of the fictional leaps that i live for : someone would take the wallet			2
who ? and why ? i began writing from that moment , and the rest followed fairly intuitively ; a peripheral character in one chapter would catch my eye , and i 'd think , " who is that person ? what does his or her inner world look like ? " @entity0 : your novel is filled with interesting and unusual characters ; do you ever base them on other people ? @entity21 : i almost never use real people ; in fact , i find that quite hard to do			1
so i feel as if i 'm making everyone up , that they have nothing to do with me or my life			0
i think thinking that actually helps me to write about them			0
but i always need to identify with a character to write about him or her -- and by " identify , " i mean see the world through that person 's eyes and have a strong sense of the inner logic of their acts and decisions , wacky or wrongheaded though they might be			2
in that sense , i think there 's some of me in all of them			2
@entity0 : i have to ask about the @entity105 chapter			0
it may be the most creative part of an already inventive book			0
what was behind it ? @entity21 : i started wanted to try writing fiction in @entity105 in the summer of 2008 , after reading in an article about the @entity115 campaign 's turnaround			1
a powerpoint presentation within the campaign was credited with a change of strategy			0
in the old days , it would have been called a " memo " or a " paper " or even a " presentation			0
" but now it was called a @entity105 -- actually branded ! that really struck me			0
i thought , " could this ubiquitous program work for fiction ? " still , there were obstacles to my using @entity105 : i had never used it before , did n't own it or have enough memory on my laptop to hold it			0
so my first attempts at writing fiction in @entity105 occurred by hand ! only months later , when i 'd finally bought the program and begun to work in it , did i begin to suspect that what had really been driving me toward it all along was a sense that it could provide a kind of microcosm of " @entity31 " : a series of moments separated by gaps , or pauses , which add up to one story in the end			1
that chapter ended up feeling like the heart of the whole book			0
@entity0 : you 've received widespread critical and public praise for your books			0
how much importance do you give to all the accolades and reviews of your work ? are you more interested in what your fans have to say ? @entity21 : it 's amazing to connect with fans , especially because i write slowly , and often with a sense that it will be a miracle if the book i 'm working on is ever finished or publishable			1
winning prizes is a new experience for me , and i 'm especially hopeful that the prizes might help me find a wider audience for " @entity31 , " which struggled in the marketplace early in its publication			1
but i 'm also keenly aware that many , many worthy books do n't win prizes , and that there 's a lot of luck involved			2
i think i got very lucky with " @entity31			1
" @entity0 : what prompted you to become a writer , and did you ever envision this level of success ? @entity21 : i still do n't envision this level of success ! what has always driven me is a love of writing itself			1
i 'm not a wildly gifted person ; i do n't play an instrument or speak another language or have great accomplishments in another field , as many writers do			0
but writing feels natural to me ; the act of it seems to free up my unconscious , so that sometimes i feel that i have access to more ideas and information than my conscious mind could think up			0
i 've known that writing was essential to me since i was about 18			0
between high school and college , i took a year off , saved up money and went to @entity201 with a backpack in the summer of 1981			0
it was n't easy being in my own company for several weeks at that age , but somehow it made me realize that i wanted to be a writer			0
@entity0 : do you have a daily routine , a schedule or a ritual when you 're writing a book ? i understand you like to write and edit your work by hand ? @entity21 : i write and edit fiction by hand , it 's true ; journalism , i write on a computer			1
i do n't know if the handwriting is so much a ritual as a necessary part of my process ; i tend to write my first drafts in a fairly blind state , without a clear plan , and the handwriting helps me to generate the most interesting material			0
my best hours are usually in the morning , and i like to write leaning back , rather than at a desk , so i often sit in a soft chair			0
unfortunately , that means that i often nap while writing ! @entity0 : can you tell us what you 're reading right now or what authors inspire you ? @entity21 : i 've just finished re-reading " @entity238 " by @entity237			1
my 10 - year - old son loved it and wanted me to read it , and i had little memory of my first reading as a teenager			2
she 's a fantastic writer ; such a huge imaginative reach , coupled with a really lovely sense of language			2
we 're going to read " @entity250 " together next			0
before that i read @entity254 's " room , " which absolutely flattened me , it was so good			2
for " @entity31 , " i was inspired by @entity256 's big novel , " @entity257			1
" i read it over years with a group of peers and feel a bit as if i 'd lived inside it ( i think we had five children among us in our years of reading it ! ) other inspirations : @entity267 's " @entity266 " ( one of my favorite books ever ) , @entity270 , @entity271 and the great 19th - century storytellers , especially @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275			1
@entity0 : in addition to your career as a novelist , you 're also a successful journalist			0
do you have any plans to return to nonfiction writing ? @entity21 : i hope to keep writing journalism as long as i write fiction ; it 's afforded me such amazing adventures and opportunities			1
it does take a lot of time , so it 's hard to do both at once , but i try to do a big journalism piece every couple of years , and i 'll hopefully continue with that			2
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity21 : there was a novel i was actually trying to start when i got sidetracked by that wallet and ended up writing " @entity31			1
" i hope i can still sink into that other book			0
it 's new territory for me ; historical fiction , set in @entity304 during and after @entity305 i 'm especially interested in women who built and repaired ships in the @entity308 near my house			2
there were thousands of women working there during the war , doing jobs like welding and riveting that would have been unthinkable for women before that			0
i 've had the honor of working on an oral history project that involved interviewing women who worked at the @entity308 , most of whom are in their 80s now			0
when the war ended , the men came home , and the women were all fired -- expected to return to traditionally feminine jobs or not work at all			0
it seems like such rich material ; i hope i can come up with some fictional way to bring it to life ! " @entity4 " also won the 2011 @entity332 and is a finalist for the @entity334 , the @entity335 and the @entity337 's @entity336			1
