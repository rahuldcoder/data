-- two years ago , @entity1 toppled a longtime dictator and reveled in the hope of a new future			2
but frustration over the new leadership and controversial court verdicts have ignited clashes regularly			0
here 's what 's behind the most recent unrest , which flared up on the two - year anniversary of the revolution			1
what sparked this latest rash of violence ? two seemingly unrelated developments			0
friday was the two - year anniversary of the 2011 @entity1 revolution			1
protesters who have been angry with the slow pace of change and with some of the steps president @entity23 has taken clashed with his supporters and police in the cities such as @entity28 and @entity29			1
at least seven people were killed in those clashes , including several by gunfire			2
it was not immediately clear who was responsible			0
then on saturday , a judge issued death sentences for 21 people from @entity38 for their roles in a football game riot last year			1
the court rulings sparked deadly clashes between security forces and relatives of the convicted			0
over the course of two days , at least 38 people -- including civilians and soldiers -- were killed in @entity38			1
` dubbed the " massacre at @entity38 " by @entity1 media , the riot broke out on february 1 , 2012 , after @entity38 - based @entity52 defeated @entity54 's @entity53 , 3 - 1			1
the riot left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured			1
fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs			0
it was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife sparked the melee			0
what 's the back story of tensions between @entity38 and @entity54 ? @entity38 residents say they have grievances that date back six decades			1
over the past 60 years , residents of @entity38 have felt betrayed by @entity1 security forces during a series of wars with @entity75			2
thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the @entity78 , the @entity79 of 1967 , the @entity80 with @entity75 , and the @entity81			0
residents of @entity38 , in northeastern @entity1 , believed security forces did not adequately defend their city			2
in addition , some say @entity54 has not invested enough in @entity38 's infrastructure , and that their city does n't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though @entity38 via the critical @entity90			2
some also say @entity38 is still getting the cold shoulder from @entity54 after a 1999 assassination attempt of then - president @entity93 , who was visiting the city			1
why are some @entity1 angry with @entity23 ? @entity23 , @entity1 's first democratically elected president , came to power last june following @entity93 's ouster a year earlier			1
but accusations of power hoarding soon followed			0
@entity23 issued a sweeping presidential decree in november , which prevented any court from overturning his decisions until a new , @entity104 constitution was passed			2
the ruling essentially gave him unchecked power , protecting from judicial review any decisions he has made since assuming office			0
protesters decried the " birth of a new pharaoh " and " @entity23 the dictator			1
" but @entity23 defended his move , saying it was only temporary until a new constitution is put in place			1
he said it was intended to safeguard the revolution , in part by preventing courts from interfering with the work of @entity1 's @entity123 , the body charged with drafting a new constitution			0
the judges , many of whom were holdover loyalists from the government of @entity93 , are widely viewed as hostile to the @entity129 who now dominate the assembly that has been charged with framing a new constitution			0
the constitution eventually passed with a nearly two - thirds majority			0
what happens now ? during a speech sunday night , @entity23 declared a limited state of emergency for violent hot spots and announced a 30 - day nighttime curfew for the provinces of @entity38 , @entity29 and @entity28			1
@entity23 said some protesters ' violent behavior " does not have anything to do with the @entity1 revolution			1
... in fact , it is against the revolution			0
" but he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in @entity1 , saying " dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security			0
" to this end , he invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting monday			2
the meeting " is meant to address problems in @entity1 , as opposed to express anger , " @entity23 's spokesman told state - run tv			1
but for a country that has seen rounds of change , dissent , celebration and violence , it 's unclear what the next chapter will be			0
