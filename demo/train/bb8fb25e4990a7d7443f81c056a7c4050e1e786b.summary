-- @entity2 deployed missile - defense systems at three sites around @entity5 early tuesday ahead of a possible missile launch by @entity7 , chief cabinet secretary @entity1 said			1
the @entity9 missile batteries were set up in the central district of @entity11 and in the suburbs of @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity1 told reporters tuesday			1
the deployments come as @entity18 and @entity19 officials warn @entity20 could be preparing for another provocative move after weeks of belligerent rhetoric			0
@entity1 had said monday that the @entity2 government would not publicize any missile - defense deployment , saying " it would show our strategy to @entity7			1
" the comments came a day after @entity7 said it would pull out all its workers and temporarily suspend operations at the industrial complex it jointly operates with the @entity19 , the latest sign of deteriorating relations on the @entity34			2
the @entity35 said it would also consider permanently closing down the @entity36 , a shared manufacturing zone that is the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries			2
on tuesday morning , the @entity40 said @entity7 workers had n't so far reported for work			1
the deteriorating situation in @entity36 came after the @entity19 government had briefly caused concern about the prospect of a new @entity7 nuclear test			1
@entity19 's unification minister @entity49 's office clarified his earlier statements in the day about @entity7 's nuclear test plans by saying the @entity35 had been " continuously preparing " for another nuclear test since february , and that there had n't been any new signs			1
there was some confusion that earlier comments may have suggested new information indicating the @entity35 's nuclear test plans -- something that could have ratcheted up tensions with @entity7			1
the minister 's office made clear that this was not his intended meaning			0
opinion : an accident , then war with @entity7 ? but the crisis at the joint industrial complex provided a tangible sign of the @entity35 's provocative stance			2
in a statement carried by the official @entity7 news agency , @entity76 , secretary of the @entity78 of the @entity79 , accused the @entity19 of seeking " to turn the zone into a hotbed of war " against the @entity35			2
@entity20 was already preventing @entity19 workers and managers from entering the complex , which sits on the @entity35 's side of the militarily fortified border , and threatened to shut it down entirely amid its recent stream of verbal broadsides against @entity90 and @entity91			2
the @entity40 was n't immediately able to confirm whether the @entity35 had actually begun withdrawing its more than 50,000 workers from @entity36 yet			1
if @entity20 follows through on its declaration , the move could be financially costly , since @entity36 is considered to be an important source of hard currency for @entity98 's isolated regime			2
the ban on the entry into the zone of new workers and trucks was already putting a strain on personnel and supplies for the scores of @entity19 companies operating there , prompting more than 10 of them to cease production			0
does @entity7 think @entity18 going soft ? a torrent of threats @entity7 has issued a catalog of alarming threats against the @entity19 and the @entity18 in the past several weeks , sharpening its rhetoric after the @entity115 imposed stricter sanctions for @entity20 's latest underground nuclear test , which took place it february			1
the strong words have put the region on edge			0
@entity90 said sunday that it believed @entity20 could conduct a missile test this week after recently moving the necessary components to the coast			1
analysts had said at the time of the february nuclear test that the @entity35 might follow up with another detonation soon afterward as it tries to push forward its nuclear program that it says it needs as a deterrent to protect it from the @entity18			1
explore more on @entity7 a delicate situation the @entity35 rattled the region last week by saying it would restart a shuttered nuclear reactor and block @entity19 from entering the @entity36 complex			1
reports then emerged late in the week suggesting the @entity35 had loaded as many as two medium - range missiles onto mobile launchers on the east coast ahead of a possible test firing			2
and the @entity19 president 's office said sunday it believed a missile launch could happen around wednesday			1
the @entity35 frayed nerves further by warning foreign diplomats inside the country that if war breaks out , it can not guarantee their safety			0
the string of troubling announcements from @entity20 followed weeks of menacing rhetoric , which included the threat of a nuclear strike on @entity19 and the @entity18			0
observers say they believe @entity7 is still years away from having an operational nuclear missile , but they note it does have conventional weapons that pose a threat to countries in the region like @entity19 and @entity2 , both of which are home to thousands of @entity18 troops			1
@entity7 : who 's in the crosshairs ? sanctions and drills the escalation in verbal threats from the @entity35 coincided with the tougher @entity115 sanctions last month and the annual joint military exercises in @entity19 by @entity18 and @entity19 forces , drills that have aggravated @entity20 in previous years			2
the @entity18 initially responded to the @entity35 's invective by publicly drawing attention to its shows of military force in the training exercises , including the flight of nuclear - capable @entity180 stealth bombers over @entity19			0
but when those moves appeared to further infuriate rather than intimidate @entity20 , raising worries that they increased the risk of a miscalculation in the crisis , @entity91 dialed back the displays of strength			0
on saturday , a senior @entity18 @entity189 official said a long - planned missile test in @entity191 , scheduled for tuesday , was being delayed to avoid any misperceptions by @entity7			1
and in a sign of the delicate situation in the region , gen. @entity194 , the top @entity18 commander in @entity19 , canceled a trip to @entity91 this week " as a prudent measure , " a @entity18 military spokesman said sunday			0
@entity194 was due to testify before the @entity200 and the @entity201			0
possible explanations analysts have attempted to explain the @entity35 's unnerving behavior by suggesting it may be an effort by @entity76 , who inherited power from his father less than a year and a half ago , to shore up domestic support , particularly with the military			0
another theory is that @entity20 is trying to secure direct negotiations with @entity91 , something the @entity18 has long shunned in favor of multilateral talks			0
the @entity7 regime 's recent words and actions appear to be increasingly troubling its key ally , @entity219			0
the new @entity219 president @entity220 , appeared to make an unusual veiled rebuke of @entity7 on sunday			1
" countries , whether big or small , strong or weak , rich or poor , should all contribute their share in maintaining and enhancing peace , " @entity220 said at an international conference , the @entity219 state - run news agency @entity222 reported			0
no one should be allowed to throw a region into chaos for selfish gains , he said , according to @entity222			0
@entity18 secretary of state @entity233 , who will visit @entity234 this week , is expected to discuss potential diplomatic incentives for @entity7 once it stops its threatening rhetoric , senior administration officials told @entity0 on condition of anonymity			1
" secretary @entity233 agrees that we have to have a robust deterrent because we really do n't know what these guys will do , " said one senior official , who was not authorized to speak on the issue			0
" but he also knows that the @entity7 need a diplomatic off - ramp and that they have to be able to see it			0
" @entity0 's @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
