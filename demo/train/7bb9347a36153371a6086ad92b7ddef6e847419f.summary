@entity0 -- two pac 3 @entity3 anti-missile batteries currently occupy what is normally a baseball pitch in the leafy grounds of @entity8 's @entity7			1
they point northwest -- in the general direction of @entity12			2
they were moved here to the heart of the @entity8 capital in the early hours of tuesday morning , alongside further batteries in two @entity0 suburbs			1
and if the intelligence is right , and @entity12 has moved one , maybe two mid-range missiles to its eastern coast , any test firing it might choose to conduct could conceivably have its trajectory over @entity8			1
@entity25 is just 800 miles ( 1,287 kilometers ) from @entity0			2
it would take between five and 10 minutes for a missile to reach the skies over @entity0			1
the concern here is not that @entity12 has @entity8 or indeed any particular target in its sights , whatever its grandiose claims , it is that something might go wrong with a missile test			1
" @entity40 are not trying to attack @entity8 but to scare the @entity41 , " says @entity37 , director of security studies at the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity0			1
'' the problem is the missile might malfunction and part of the debris might land on @entity8 territory			1
" residents whose homes overlook the @entity7 are getting used to these military apparitions outside their bedroom windows			0
the @entity54 have been deployed here three times since 2009 , each time @entity12 has announced it will launch what it claims is a satellite , but what most other countries call a missile			1
" the situation is acute , " @entity8 's defense minister told the unit commander on a visit to the site laid on for journalists			2
" be ready to take prompt action whenever the order is made			0
" it is arguable that this deployment in the heart of the capital is partly for show -- to guarantee photographers an easy front page and thus reassure nervous @entity75 that their safety is secured			0
but the missile defense shield the @entity8 have developed with the @entity41 to safeguard this region is one of the world 's most sophisticated			2
these latest deployments are about fine - tuning			0
if the previous three " satellite " launches are anything to go by , the @entity8 government will have positioned @entity87 equipped with sm - 3 missile interception systems in the @entity89 , also known as the @entity90			1
it has been widely reported that has happened -- though the government wo n't confirm it , unwilling to " show its cards , " a spokesman said , to the @entity40			0
these deployments should suffice , says @entity37			0
" generally a sea - based system is more useful because it has a wider area it can defend			0
@entity100 3 is more contained but together they are effective			0
'' but @entity102 's belligerence has some @entity0 residents clearly worried			0
@entity104 came out in search of tv crews like us armed with a map showing how far @entity12 's missiles can reach			2
" @entity12 can hit @entity8 in five minutes , " he said			1
" if there are miscalculations between @entity41 and @entity12 , military conflict will happen			0
" for others though , the overriding emotion is astonishment -- astonishment at their puffed up neighbor 's endless posturing .			0

@entity3 anti-missile batteries appeared *overnight* this week in @entity8 capital
they are deployed in case @entity12 carries out its threat to test - fire a missile
would take between five and 10 minutes for missile to reach skies over @entity0
@entity8 has deployed these measures before during previous launches
