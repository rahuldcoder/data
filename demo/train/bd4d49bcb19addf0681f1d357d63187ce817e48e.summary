are you starting to take for granted the popping colors and hyper - detail of your hdtv ? fear not			0
@entity4 television is on the way , with screens that promise four times better resolution than today 's best high - definition offerings			1
a standard high - definition tv has a 1080p resolution , meaning more than 2 million pixels per frame			0
the new wave of @entity13 have more than 8.8 million pixels , providing greater accuracy of detail ; clearer , sharper pictures ; and greater contrast and color than regular hd			1
so far @entity21 is leading the pack with a giant @entity4 model already on the market with others hitting stores soon			1
but other manufacturers are n't far behind , meaning some living rooms might soon feel a lot more like going to the theater for a blockbuster			0
@entity21 is hoping that consumers will be willing to pay for that experience			2
last fall , the electronics giant unveiled a @entity4 television that measured 84 inches diagonally and cost a hefty $ 25,000			1
now , they 're rolling out smaller and less expensive models , as well			0
the knock so far has been that there 's not very much content out there yet that can actually take advantage of @entity4 's higher - def display			1
but @entity21 says it 's working on that , too , as the technology becomes more mainstream			1
" the digital cinema set started to focus on @entity4			2
even films that are being shot in @entity4 , you 're going to the movie theater and not even realizing it , " @entity48 , a @entity21 spokesman , said			1
" they are showing you an upscale version of that movie on a @entity4 projector			0
because movies and the movie theater experience has gone in that direction and consumers want that same experience in their homes , it was a logical step for us			0
" @entity48 said that with fewer consumers purchasing televisions under 40 inches , bigger is becoming standard and the resolution had to improve			0
@entity21 will release 65 - inch and a 55 - inch versions that can be in homes starting this month , coupled with a video player set for release in june that can show movies produced in @entity4			1
" what @entity4 allows is for bigger screens to look just as good as they 're supposed to and allow consumers to get closer to the tv for a more immersive , home theater experience -- something more similar to what it 's like to go to the movies , " @entity48 said			1
while @entity21 is the most prominent company getting into @entity4 , they 're not alone			1
@entity85 tech company @entity84 is rolling out a cheaper 4k television for $ 1,500			0
it does n't have many fancy features , which accounts for the price , and it comes on the heels of other simple and cheap offerings out of @entity85			0
@entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 have all turned heads with eye - popping displays at tech gatherings , as well			1
the @entity4 picture starts with the camera , which can capture details better than standard hd cameras			1
@entity48 said the image sensor in the @entity4 camera is far larger than an average video capture device			0
but do n't think of this like @entity107 's attempt at 48 frames per second with " @entity109 , " which was jarring for some viewers			0
@entity48 said the amount of digital data being captured with @entity4 cameras is the main difference			0
the end product with a @entity4 camera and television is going to visually be clearer , crisper and more detailed than something shot at 48 frames per second , he says			2
the " wizard behind the curtain " in the @entity4 television is a multichip processor called the @entity120			0
not only does it render native @entity4 into a sharper picture , but it also analyzes frame - by - frame non- @entity4 signals to get them to look as good as possible			1
that means even content not shot in @entity4 will look better , @entity48 said			1
" if you are watching a @entity131 , which is as pristine as it 's going to get for 1080p resolution , it 's going to upscale it to pretty darn near @entity4 , " he said			2
" if you are watching a 720p broadcast of @entity137 , it may not get as close , but it 's going to look a lot better			0
" right now , there are no cable channels or satellite providers offering @entity4 broadcasts , but @entity21 is in talks with @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 about adding those channels			1
a new @entity4 video player is coming out in june that will include 10 movies and 40 - 50 shorts rendered in @entity151			2
later this summer , @entity21 is launching a digital download service offering a wider variety of @entity4 content			1
@entity48 said there are more than 100 movies in native @entity151			0
when the 84 - inch 4k television was revealed last fall , many said it was too big -- both the size of the screen and the price tag -- to appeal to the home consumer			1
@entity48 said @entity21 has been able to reduce the costs to something comparable to the cost of a premium hd television			2
" for $ 5,500 , you can have a @entity4 television and @entity4 movies in your house come june of this year , " he said			2
while major motion picture companies have been leading the charge to @entity4 , home film makers can make their own 4k movies or pictures if their camera is good enough			2
@entity48 said technically , any digital camera that is higher than 8 megapixels is considered @entity4			0
" but no one has a television in their house that was able to see all that resolution their cameras were picking up , " he said			0
" ( @entity13 ) can let you see the pictures as you saw them			0

new wave of @entity13 offers picture four times sharper than hd
@entity21 is already on the market with a 84 - inch model for $ 25,000
one complaint so far is that there 's not much content shot in @entity4
@entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity21 and @entity94 all have sets in the works
