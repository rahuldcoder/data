remember that scene at the end of that @entity2 when @entity4 's character sits alone at a computer screen hitting the refresh button over and over again -- stuck in a loop of anxiety and longing ? that 's how i felt last week			2
on june 10 , to re-launch a @entity13 project called @entity14 , my editors and i put forward 20 story ideas for your consideration -- and i agreed to do whatever five stories got the most votes			1
meantime , a colleague of mine created an internal web page so i could monitor , in all - the - time - real - time , which stories were leading the race			1
that internal website , which had a yellow banner that said , " confidential : for internal use only " at the top of it , was titled " how @entity31 's going to be spending the rest of 2013			2
" i was nervous about the results because i was excited to know what i would be reporting on , of course -- but , more importantly , because the topics @entity38 's editors put forward really do matter : the most dangerous roads in the world ; @entity43 's failing education system ; the country where 1 in 100 live births kills the mother			1
these stories could make a difference			2
so i checked that website again and again , to the point i briefly developed an eye twitch			2
this is n't like me , by the way			2
i 'm the kind of person who ( usually ) sits through dinner without reading texts			2
but for the seven days the poll was open i turned into some sort of one - function cyborg			1
i 'm pleased to tell you the wait is finally over			2
my eye twitch has subsided and normal life can resume			2
at 2 p.m. on monday we closed the poll			2
and here are the results			2
these are the @entity14 stories for the next year -- with one wild - card topic still to be determined by my editors ( who i 'm being reallllly nice to this week )			1
@entity43 's widening rich - poor gap ( 16,789 votes ) 2			1
illegal animal trade ( 13,276 votes ) 3			2
where rape is most common ( 12,996 ) 4			2
the world 's poorest children ( 12,820 ) 5			0
@entity43 's most endangered river ( 12,002 ) each story will focus on an extreme case -- the state with the widest rich - poor gap or the place where rape is most common			1
together we 'll try to start a conversation that could , in the long run , bump these places off the bottom of their respective lists			0
i 'll announce the first story soon and will reveal the focus of each story ( which river is the most endangered , for instance ) during the reporting process			1
i love that each of these stories was chosen by you			0
i see that as a mandate of sorts			0
when journalists pitch big projects they sometimes wonder , " is this really the best use of my time ? " i do n't have those doubts with @entity114			0
i know i 'm working on your behalf -- on the topics you 've deemed most important			1
this is journalism as democracy -- rebalanced to give you power			1
that 's the way it should be			0
i also think this vote created a pact between us			0
i know that you 'll have my back as i tackle these subjects and ask for your help in gathering info and pushing for change			0
these are subjects that are too massive to take on alone			0
i 'll need your help			0
i 'll leave you with the rest of the list just so you can get a sense of what your peers on the internet value			0
as i wrote last week , i was surprised by these numbers -- not the fact that 32,546 ballots were submitted , but because a story about the economy finished at the top of the list , and several ideas i found to be most interesting ( the country with 100,000 new cases of leprosy per year ; the place in the @entity43 without internet access ) received relatively few votes			1
about half of you picked the income inequality story , the winner , which would have been near the bottom of my ballot			1
only 9 % of the ballots submitted included the leprosy story , which would have been my top pick			1
all these are worthy subjects			0
but the vote gave me pause			0
it made me re-evaluate my news judgment -- and realize how interesting and rewarding it can be to include your perspectives in the story - selection process			1
you see things i 'd miss on my own			0
and during the vote , you also gave me at least 97 story ideas that could be the basis for the wild card sixth story			1
how cool is that ? i hope you 'll follow this project over the coming months -- and participate in its creation			1
the @entity14 homepage -- http://cnn.com/changethelist -- is one place to look for updates			1
we also have @entity187 , and my personal social networks are listed in the editor 's note at the top of the story			1
thanks to all who voted			1
i 'm excited for this journey			0
i must have the best job in journalism			1
and it 's because i have all of you guiding me			0
here 's the rest of the list , including vote totals : 6			0
where conflict is never - ending ( 11,566 ) 7			1
the state with the highest drop - out rate ( 10,372 ) 8			1
