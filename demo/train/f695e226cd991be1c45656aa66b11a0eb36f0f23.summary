@entity0 -- @entity3 's fiery prime minister ratcheted up rapidly - escalating tensions with @entity5 on tuesday , comparing @entity7 's once - close ally in the @entity8 to a " spoiled boy " and announcing additional sanctions would soon be imposed			1
" we are completely suspending all of these , trade relations , military relations , related with the defense industry , " @entity11 said , according to the semi-official @entity12			1
" all of these are completely suspended and other measures will follow this process			0
" asked to clarify whether this meant @entity3 will halt more than $ 3 billion in bilateral trade , an official in the @entity3 prime ministry , speaking on condition of anonymity under government protocol , insisted @entity11 was not referring to trade relations			1
" he was referring to the defense industry , " the official said			0
" nothing more than the measures that have been announced so far			0
" last week , @entity3 declared it was downgrading relations with @entity5 , suspending all military agreements between the two countries and giving senior @entity5 diplomats less than a week to leave @entity3 territory			1
" if the current steps are regarded as ' plan b , ' there will be a ' plan c , ' " @entity11 said on tuesday in his first public comments on the matter since @entity7 imposed sanctions on @entity5			2
@entity11 's government is incensed that @entity5 refuses to apologize or pay compensation for eight slain @entity3 and one @entity44			1
the humanitarian workers and activists were shot dead by @entity5 commandos in a botched 2010 raid on an aid convoy that was trying to bust @entity5 's sea blockade of @entity51			1
but " @entity5 does not want to see a further deterioration in the relationship with @entity3 , " said a senior @entity5 government official , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue			1
" there have been a number of proposals on the table to prevent a deterioration and unfortunately they have not been successful , but from our point of view a deterioration in the relationship serves neither side 's interests			0
" multiple @entity5 sources said they are doing what they can to be responsible and reverse the negative dynamic			2
some @entity5 officials believe the current troubles between the two countries are minor bumps that can be smoothed out with time and the proper diplomacy			2
others believe the deteriorating relationship has little to do with @entity5 and more to do with a reorientation of @entity3 foreign policy towards the @entity83 world			1
a possible @entity11 trip to @entity51 is contributing to that school of thought			0
diplomats in @entity88 and @entity7 tell @entity1 that @entity11 is tentatively scheduled to visit @entity88 next week			0
there is growing speculation in local media that the @entity3 prime minister may try to visit @entity51 via @entity95 's @entity94 border crossing			1
" this is a process that will continue until the last moment , " @entity11 said tuesday , according to @entity12 , when asked about a trip to @entity51			0
" we will make the final decision there , talking to our @entity95 friends and brothers			0
according to that , there may be a trip to @entity51			0
" despite deteriorating political relations between @entity109 and @entity7 , trade has grown substantially between the two countries over the last year , according to @entity3 government statistics			1
on monday , @entity112 , governor of the @entity113 , gave a speech in which he highlighted the importance of @entity5 's economic ties with @entity3			2
he noted that @entity3 's economy was the largest in the region , with a gross domestic product in excess of $ 700 billion , and that @entity3 is becoming a key player in regional trade			2
@entity3 is a significant @entity5 trading partner , @entity123 said , and damage to the trade relationship between the two countries could have serious consequences for @entity5			1
@entity128 , @entity129 - based editor at @entity130 and expert on @entity3 - @entity5 relations , argues the @entity8 " outsider " status that once drew @entity3 and @entity5 together into an alliance during the 1990s has changed , as @entity3 has grown economically and established closer political ties with @entity137 neighbors			1
" the paths have diverged , " @entity128 said			0
" what you have left is two countries with different visions currently for their position in the region			0
so @entity3 wants to build a more unified region with more open borders that ultimately helps trade and ultimately helps @entity3 see itself as a regional leader			2
@entity5 sees itself as isolated in the region , increasingly threatened and increasingly concerned with security issues			0
" prior to the report about @entity11 's comments tuesday , @entity151 , a senior @entity5 defense official , told @entity5 radio that despite the reports , @entity3 is not disengaging from @entity5			1
contrary to what is being reported , he said , the @entity5 military attache to @entity3 is continuing his work there			2
@entity1 's @entity159 and @entity160 reported from @entity0 ; @entity161 reported from @entity109			0
journalist @entity162 in @entity88 contributed to this report .			0
