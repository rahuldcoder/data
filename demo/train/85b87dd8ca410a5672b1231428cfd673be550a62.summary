-- it just about broke @entity3 's heart to have to tell her 6 - year - old daughter , @entity4 , that she could n't buy her a @entity6 costume this year			1
the child knows little about the adult struggles that @entity3 and her fiance are facing as federal employees who have been working without pay since october 1			0
@entity3 , who works for the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , is trying to shield @entity4 and her 9 - year - old brother as long as she can			0
" having to explain to your children why they ca n't go to tutoring right now , or why they ca n't get a @entity6 costume or pumpkin , or why they ca n't attend a friend 's birthday party , all because of this nonsense in @entity25 , is horrible , " @entity3 wrote on @entity16			1
she said she shared her story with @entity0 because " i feel like i have no other way to voice my concerns and to help my children than to speak up			0
" since the @entity31 government went on a partial shutdown , @entity16 has received more than 1,500 stories from families , many sharing fears and worries about what will happen if the impasse lags on			1
plenty of families are already feeling the collateral damage -- and begging for an end to the paralysis in @entity25			0
' put my grandma back to work ' on tuesday , 59 - year - old @entity47 had to ask her two grandchildren to eat the free breakfast offered at school because her cupboards were bare			1
she always makes the 9 - and 10 - year - olds breakfast -- fried potatoes , a little bacon , cut - up bananas and a sweet roll			1
she cried just thinking about it as she took them to school			2
@entity47 also reflected on the irony of the situation -- her grandchildren having to take government assistance because the government forced her out of work			1
it would normally be peak season at the @entity68 in @entity69 in @entity70 , where @entity47 has worked as a server or hostess for the past 30 years			1
she can usually count on making $ 1,000 a week this month -- enough to get her through the four months of the year when the lodge is closed			0
but temporary layoffs for @entity47 and 200 - plus workers at the resort went into effect on october 1 after the park 's closure			1
she expects to come back to work after the government resumes , but she wo n't get back any of her lost pay because the lodge is owned by a private company			1
losing her job in october " has taken my @entity85 savings away , has taken what i could have saved for winter to get heat , food and pay my bills , " she wrote			0
" how can anyone who had a part in shutting down the government look at themselves in the mirror ? " writing letters to the editor of her newspaper and going to protests with her grandson has helped @entity47 feel like she 's making her voice heard			1
the boy held a sign he made that said " please put my grandma back to work			2
" @entity31 on the edge furloughed 90 % of his staff small - business owner @entity110 estimates he 's losing $ 40,000 in revenue a week			1
his company does modeling and simulation , as well as network engineering , for the @entity115			0
and that number does n't include the $ 300,000 in outstanding invoices he has from a project work completed in july			2
" that 's pretty tough for a small business , " he said			2
he 's had to furlough 90 % of his @entity124 , @entity125 , staff because of lost business			1
and because his employees are not federal workers , they wo n't recoup that pay , he said			2
" my mind is with my employees , some of whom have run out of vacation time and are dipping into their savings , " @entity110 said			0
" i have offered up early @entity85 bonuses , and some have opted to take them			0
" but his attempts to make the best of the situation are n't enough to assuage all of his employees			1
" some of my best and brightest employees are already looking for employment elsewhere , and they would be very hard to replace , " he said			0
" our shutdown fears have been realized			2
" ' i am collateral damage ' @entity3 is a claims representative for the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , and her fiance is a supervisor at the @entity150 at the @entity152 airport			0
both have been deemed essential workers by the government , so they must work without pay or face disciplinary action			0
they 'll get paid eventually , but that 's little solace now when @entity3 's figuring out how to stretch out her last check -- for 48 hours of pay instead of 80 -- to cover her kids ' before - and - after - school care and the gas she needs to keep showing up to work			1
@entity3 has tried to shield her children from her money woes ; they 've already been through a lot , having lost their father , uncle and grandfather in a boating accident last year			2
but the missing paycheck is already affecting them			0
@entity3 canceled the private tutoring her son has received since falling behind in school last year and has told her daughter she ca n't go to two birthday parties because they ca n't pay for gifts or gas to get there			1
" i also have bills to pay such as food , water , electricity , housing , etc. i can only hold off creditors for so long			0
i can only balance the tightrope for so long , " she wrote in a comment on her @entity16			0
" i did nothing to cause this			0
i 've done nothing but be a loyal worker			2
" update : a reader in @entity197 saw this story and arranged to pay for @entity6 costumes for @entity3 's two children at a party store near them			0
another reader , in @entity204 , had a $ 500 supermarket gift card sent to @entity47			1
how has the shutdown affected your life ? send a photo to @entity16 and tell us how the shutdown has affected you in a tangible way			1
@entity0 's @entity212 contributed to this story .			0

@entity215 says the math is against her family : 2 feds *+* 2 kids *=* *trouble*
@entity47 ca n't afford to make her grandchildren breakfast ; they got the free one at school
a @entity125 business owner has had to furlough 90 % his staff ; some may not come back
