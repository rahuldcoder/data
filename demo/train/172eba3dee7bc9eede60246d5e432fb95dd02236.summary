as if scripted by @entity4 , former @entity2 gov. @entity1 's death on @entity3 came just hours after his son , @entity6 , was sworn in to a second term in the same office			1
it was a storybook ending to a larger than life career and personality that raised enduring questions about whether @entity1 's style of big - hearted , big - state liberalism can win the @entity15			1
@entity1 was famous for the idealism he expressed in soaring oratory , but he had a prickly practical side as well			0
@entity1 , the political infighter , was famously combative : he frequently picked fights with the press and had a contentious relationship with the state legislature that included comparing them to clapping monkeys in one address			0
in 1977 , @entity1 famously ran three races for @entity2 mayor against @entity28 in a single year , a bitter string of campaigns that included a scurrilous flier suggesting @entity28 was gay ( @entity28 denied this until his death ; @entity1 denied any knowledge of the flier )			1
@entity1 lost all three contests , but bounced back to defeat @entity28 in the 1982 race for governor			2
that 's when @entity1 began to tantalize his fellow @entity41 , many of whom wanted him to lead a liberal counterattack on the conservative @entity46 philosophy embodied by president @entity47			2
an electrifying speech at the @entity49 sent @entity1 to the front ranks of @entity41 candidates -- and in 1991 , a plane famously idled at a local airport , waiting for a go - ahead to rush paperwork to @entity56 that would have enrolled him in the 1992 presidential primary			2
in the end , after extended deliberations that earned him the nickname " @entity60 on the @entity61 , " @entity1 opted not to run for president , and in 1993 he turned down an all - but - engraved invitation by president @entity65 to accept a nomination to the @entity67			0
the consensus among @entity2 's political class is that @entity1 avoided the national stage due to personal doubts and hesitations ; as one observer put it , " @entity1 simply did not trust enough people to build the kind of staff needed to run an effective national campaign			1
" but the question remains : would @entity80 have been ready to elect an unabashed liberal ? and is the country ready to do so now ? at a time when income inequality has far surpassed even the startling differences of the 1980s , liberalism shows signs of revival			0
after 20 years of electing @entity46 mayors , @entity90 voters in 2013 chose @entity92 , whose promise to close the gap between rich and poor was embodied in a line -- a " tale of two cities " -- taken directly from @entity1 's 1984 speech			1
@entity1 's son , @entity2 gov. @entity100 , used his inaugural speech to focus on national issues : he included talk of raising the minimum wage and boasts about being the first big state in the nation to legalize same - sex marriage and implement tough restrictions on gun ownership			1
@entity100 said his father , on what turned out to be his deathbed , had reviewed the speech			0
" he said it was a good speech , " @entity6 said			0
a hint , perhaps , of things to come .			0

@entity118 : @entity1 's death a *reminder* of when a strong liberal *mulled* presidential run
he says @entity1 's son , @entity2 's governor , also eyes presidency . can liberalism make comeback ?
