@entity0 , @entity1 -- the passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure tuesday means @entity1 is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production , sale and consumption of the drug			1
it 's practically a done deal			0
president @entity13 has to sign the bill before it becomes a law			0
but he 's long backed the measure , and there 's little doubt that he remains behind it			0
@entity19 and cheers rang out in @entity1 's @entity21 on tuesday after the high - profile vote at the end of a lengthy debate on the bill			1
the measure passed @entity1 's lower house in july			1
supporters of the proposal have said it marks a turning point and could inspire other @entity33 nations to take a similar approach			1
it places the @entity37 country at the vanguard of liberal drug policies , surpassing even the @entity40 , where recreational drugs are illegal but a policy of tolerance is in place			0
" it is understood that a regulation - based policy has positive consequences for health and public security , given that , on the one hand , it can produce better results when it comes to education , prevention , information , treatment and rehabilitation in relation to the problematic uses of drugs , " said sen. @entity45 of @entity1 's @entity47 coalition , which supported the measure			1
" on the other hand , it helps fight drug trafficking , which fuels organized crime and criminal activities that affect the security of the population			1
" critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences			1
" this bill , which proposes an experiment in social engineering , as it was described in the public health commission , does not comply with any of the ethical safeguards of experimentation with human beings , " said sen. @entity75 of the @entity76			1
" those safeguards are extremely important ... given that we 're talking about marijuana , a substance that harms human beings			1
" a letter sent by @entity91 's government to lawmakers last year presented the bill			1
he told @entity2 en @entity95 last year that he supported legalizing marijuana			1
" if we legalize it , we think that we will spoil the market ( for drug traffickers ) because we are going to sell it for cheaper than it is sold on the black market , " he said			2
" and we are going to have people identified			0
" conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that @entity91 's comments were uninformed			2
details still in the works the proposed law would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as many as 480 grams for personal use			2
marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time			2
users would have to register , and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor 's prescription			0
marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies			2
once the bill becomes law , there will be a 120 - day period to give the government time to adopt regulations and implement it			0
consumption of marijuana has been legal @entity1 , but its production and sale are not			1
" we seek to eliminate that incongruence , " the country 's top drug official , @entity140 , told @entity2 earlier this year			0
the same debates about marijuana that exist in the @entity146 -- about medicinal properties , recreational use , the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in @entity1 for a long time , @entity140 said			1
the decision to push legislation to overhaul its drug policies did not come overnight			0
" we have reflected on our problems , " @entity140 said , and the government felt that @entity1 's tradition of tolerance and equality merited action on the marijuana issue			1
widespread debate but many in the traditionally @entity164 country of 3.3 million people feel supporters are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons			2
in a july poll from @entity171 , 63 % of @entity1 respondents said they disagreed with the bill			1
only 26 % said they approved of the measure in the poll , which surveyed more than 1,000 @entity1 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points			1
opponent @entity75 says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction			2
" it 's a very bad piece of legislation , mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market , " he said			2
backers of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition			0
for one , violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison			0
those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances			0
the legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention and bans the advertising of cannabis in any form			0
