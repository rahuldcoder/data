-- after weeks of controversy over @entity4 's views on waterboarding , the @entity1 late thursday approved the former judge 's nomination for attorney general by a 53 - 40 vote			1
@entity10 threatened to derail the approval of president @entity13 's nominee to lead the @entity14			1
president @entity13 nominated @entity4 to replace longtime ally @entity15 , who resigned in september			1
the nomination had been considered at risk after a number of @entity20 senators opposed @entity4 because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance			1
@entity4 , a former federal judge in @entity28 , told senators he considers waterboarding " repugnant , " but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture , which @entity32 and international law bans			1
waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning			0
@entity4 's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key @entity20 on the @entity40 -- sens. @entity42 of @entity43 and @entity44 of @entity28 -- said they would vote in favor of @entity4 despite the controversy			1
" the @entity14 , once the crown jewel among government institutions , is adrift and rudderless , " @entity44 said tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11 - 8 to send @entity4 's nomination to the @entity1 floor			0
" it desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and i believe judge @entity4 is that person			1
" @entity44 said that in a meeting friday the nominee said that @entity59 would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president " would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore " it			1
@entity44 said he believed @entity4 would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general			2
" indeed , his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president 's previous attorney general nominees have			0
" but @entity4 's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with sen. @entity79 , @entity80 , the @entity40 's chairman			0
" some have sought to find comfort in judge @entity4 's personal assurance that he would enforce a future , new law against waterboarding if this @entity59 were to pass one , " @entity79 said tuesday			1
" @entity89 , of course , is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president			0
" however , the committee 's ranking @entity94 , sen. @entity96 of @entity97 , said he believed @entity4 would enforce a law banning waterboarding			2
" he could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances , " @entity96 said earlier			0
" but he is intelligent ; he 's really learned in the law			0
he 's strong , ethical , honest beyond any question			0
he 's not an intimate of the president			0
" a majority of @entity32 consider waterboarding a form of torture , but some of those say it 's ok for the @entity32 government to use the technique , according to a poll released tuesday			2
asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture , more than two - thirds of respondents , or 69 percent , said yes ; 29 percent said no. asked whether they think the @entity32 government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists , 58 percent said no ; 40 percent said yes			2
the @entity124 telephone poll of 1,024 @entity32 adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points			0
