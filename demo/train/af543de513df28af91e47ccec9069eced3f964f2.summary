-- federal authorities have ordered @entity2 to make safety improvements to a ruptured pipeline in @entity5 that caused 750 to 1,000 barrels of crude oil to gush into the @entity8 last week			1
the cause of the pipeline break is still under investigation , authorities said			0
the @entity14 @entity16 's @entity15 issued a corrective action order to @entity18 that will require the safety measures along the @entity21 hazardous liquid pipeline , the federal agency said late tuesday			1
the order will require @entity2 to re-bury the pipeline underneath the river bed to protect it from external damage , the federal agency said in a statement			2
the oil company will also have to conduct a risk assessment on the pipeline where it crosses any waterway			2
@entity34 will then need to submit a restart plan before operation can resume , officials said			2
" the safety of our nation 's pipelines is a priority and the investigation into this incident is ongoing , " @entity14 transportation secretary @entity37 said in a statement			0
" it is our responsibility to ensure pipelines are safely delivering energy to @entity14 households and businesses , and when companies are not living up to our safety standards , we will take action			0
we will continue to work with the @entity55 , while ensuring that those responsible are held accountable			0
" the @entity58 is a 12 - inch pipeline about 69 miles long and carries crude oil from the @entity21 station in @entity62 , @entity63 , to an @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity5 , federal officials said			1
this spring , in the wake of several major pipeline accidents , @entity37 announced an action plan to immediately begin addressing concerns about the state of the nation 's aging pipeline infrastructure , and he called upon @entity14 pipeline owners and operators to conduct a comprehensive review of their oil and gas pipelines to identify areas of high risk and accelerate critical repair and replacement work			1
@entity37 has also proposed federal legislation that would improve oversight on pipeline safety and increase the maximum civil penalties for pipeline violations from $ 100,000 per day to $ 250,000 per day , and from $ 1 million for a series of violations to $ 2.5 million for a series of violations			0
on tuesday , @entity5 's governor declared a state of emergency in @entity8 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity101 counties , all of which have been affected by the spill that occurred just before midnight friday			1
@entity2 reported 750 to 1,000 barrels ( 32,000 to 42,000 gallons ) of oil spilling into the river in @entity107 , about 16 miles southwest of @entity65			1
the longest undammed river in the @entity14 , the @entity8 eventually leads into the @entity109 , one of the biggest in the @entity14			2
@entity111 , the president of the @entity18 , told reporters tuesday that spilled oil had been confirmed 25 miles away , with most pockets of oil within 19 miles of the leak site			1
but in the emergency declaration , which paves the way for emergency funds for the seven counties , @entity5 gov. @entity117 claimed that oil has since been discovered beyond @entity123 , about 90 miles from the leak site			1
but the federal order says that overflights conducted as recently as sunday have observed oil deposits as far as 240 miles downstream in @entity128 , @entity5			1
@entity117 , a @entity129 , stated in the executive order that the " @entity18 ( is ) the responsible party for this release			1
" @entity2 has seen " measureable progress , " said @entity111 , as it has stepped up its cleanup effort -- one that 's come under criticism from @entity117			1
the @entity138 - based firm has committed 350 people to the spill response , and of those , between 150 to 200 people are actually on the ground , cleaning up and looking for oil , @entity111 said			2
the federal @entity15 said it has three inspectors on site and they are working with the @entity14 @entity55 and @entity146 to conduct investigations			0
" we 're going to keep adding resources , " @entity2 @entity148 told @entity0 on tuesday			2
" that 's our focus -- find the oil , clean it up and get it back to its original state as quickly as possible			1
" @entity117 toured the spill site tuesday morning , one day after criticizing the speed and effectiveness of the response in an interview with @entity0			0
later that day , @entity111 of @entity2 said , " we do not yet have a resolution , as to what caused the incident			2
" while no official determination has been made on what caused the pipeline rupture , the governor said it is easy to see the dangers posed by fast - moving waters			0
any pipelines built now , @entity117 noted , must be buried deeper under the riverbed in order to prevent such incidents			0
the governor called it premature to minimize the spill 's potential impact by saying , for instance , that it has only affected 10 miles of the river			1
his fear is that the abundance of fish , birds and animals in the area , which is about 100 miles downstream from @entity186 , may be hurt in the short and long term			1
" my biggest concern is those 1,000 barrels , " @entity117 said			0
" you can not dump ( that much oil ) into a pristine trout stream without causing damage to the fisheries			0
" besides the fish , the area is home to @entity199 geese , ducks , ospreys , otters and bald eagles , said @entity204 , an ecologist and conservation biologist who heads the @entity206			0
the birds , in particular , might die directly or indirectly as they go after fish			0
toxins may kill critical insects , which in turn could have a trickle - down effect on the multimillion - dollar fishing industry , he said			0
" it could take years to really understand the impact of the spill , " @entity204 said			0
the @entity8 is the nation 's longest river without a dam -- a plus for the spill cleanup efforts because the continuously running water more easily breaks up the toxins , but a negative because any ill effects could spread into the @entity109 and its other tributaries , @entity204 said			1
more than 48,000 feet of absorbent boom and 2,300 absorbent pads had been used as of tuesday to soak up the oil , while " vacuum trucks " and tankers have been positioned nearby to transport them from the scene , according to @entity2			1
the company said the air quality and municipal water systems are also being monitored , while planes are routinely flying over the river to help detect patches of oil			0
@entity239 , an @entity2 spokesman , said the company is committed to staying the course and studying the effects through the whole course of the river			2
that includes checking water quality as far downstream as @entity247 ( 144 miles ) and @entity248 ( 222 miles ) from the original spill site			2
@entity0 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			0

an @entity2 official says oil detected 25 miles downstream
but the state says 90 miles and the feds say 240 miles downstream
@entity5 declares a state of emergency for 7 counties , says @entity2 is responsible
@entity18 officials remain *unclear* of the cause of the spill in @entity5 's @entity8
