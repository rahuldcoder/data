" if i had to score our performance , i can but repeat what @entity18 president ( @entity38 said , giving us something between a five and six , but all the same i am proud of what the team was able to do			2
" we need a car that is about five or six tenths quicker : achieving that wo n't be a walk in the park , but i have every confidence in our engineers and in a team that dominated the last decade in @entity5 and holds every possible record in this sport			2
" let us not forget that i managed to get on the podium ten times and to score more points than last year			0
