@entity0 -- until about four years ago , farmer @entity2 and his family had been living in rural @entity5 province , growing grain and other staples on a small plot of land			1
now they live in the outskirts of @entity0 , renting a tiny house owned by a local farmer			0
in the morning he drives a minivan to drop off his seven - year - old daughter to a migrants ' school before he plies his trade selling construction materials			0
his wife augments the family 's income by working in the city as a household maid			2
the @entity24 are among the millions of peasants who have moved away from the land into the cities			2
they are the new urban dwellers in @entity30 and their ranks are growing			1
at the end of 2011 , @entity30 counted over 690 million urban dwellers -- or 51.27 % of the country 's 1.347 billion people -- according to a report this week from the @entity37			1
that marks an increase of 21 million from the previous year			2
during the same period the rural population dropped by over 14 million to 656 million			1
so for the first time , @entity30 's urban population now outnumbers the rural population			1
" this is one of history 's most important population shifts , " said @entity44 , population expert and professor emeritus at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
" it resembles the 19th century @entity52 in @entity53 , except that in @entity30 it 's compacted into only a few decades			1
" most @entity30 traditionally made a living from subsistence farming			1
while many still do , their ranks have significantly shrunk			0
@entity30 's rapid economic growth over the past three decades has expanded the size of @entity30 's cities and towns			1
there are now over 160 cities in @entity30 with a population of over 1 million , according to @entity68			1
mega-cities like @entity70 , @entity0 and @entity71 have served as the engines of this growth , creating jobs and wealth			0
lured by the prospect of wages much greater than those available in the countryside , millions of farmers headed for urban areas			0
they constitute the " liudong renkou , " or floating population , that moves in and out of @entity30 's urban areas every day , taking up odd jobs in construction sites , public infrastructure projects , restaurants and households			1
officials say there are about 200 million of them nationwide			0
" they do the heavy , dirty and dangerous jobs that we urbanites are no longer willing to do , " said @entity93 , a @entity0 resident who works for a government agency			0
these farmers , also known as " mingong " ( migrant workers ) , work in cities but most of them remain as farm residents			0
it is difficult for them to become legitimate urban residents because of the " hukou " system , a centuries - old household registration system which categorizes the population into rural and urban residents			1
without an urban hukou permit , they are often denied access to the subsidized health care , housing and education for their children that urbanites enjoy			0
this hukou system has been a source of controversy among experts who advocate its abolition and city planners who worry about mass migration			2
critics of the policy say it causes discrimination against the mingong and exacerbates social tensions between the haves and have - nots			0
some rural migrants secure temporary residence certificates but getting them is a cumbersome and expensive process			0
" it 's almost as difficult as getting a ' green card ' in the @entity143 , ' " @entity140 quipped			0
but with the aim of sopping up excess rural labor and pushing @entity30 's urbanization goal , @entity30 authorities have gradually relaxed the enforcement of the regulations			1
it has yet to officially scrap the hukou system but more cities are now allowing farmers to move in , some temporarily and some permanently			0
the urbanization movement is changing the face of @entity30 , making it more metropolitan and prosperous			2
" urbanization will be the engine to big - scale social changes and provide employment opportunities , " said @entity157 , director of the @entity158 at the @entity159			0
" it will affect people 's lifestyle , way of production , occupational structure , consuming habits and value systems			2
" but it is also bringing problems , such as rising criminality , traffic and housing congestion and social tensions			0
just as worrisome , experts say , is the enormous pressure the new urbanites place on the cities ' finances and infrastructure			1
" the increase of urban population poses a challenge on the distribution of resources , " said @entity184 , a professor at @entity186 's @entity185			1
that is why , he says , megacities like @entity0 and @entity70 are trying to limit population growth , even as small and medium - sized cities are encouraging migrant farmers to shift from being rural to urban hukou residents			1
@entity30 hopes to avoid the " city diseases " such as mass unemployment , over-crowding , water and power shortages , and slums			2
@entity204 , a professor at @entity205 , cautions against the emergence of " a kind of ' over-urbanization ' like those in some @entity211 countries where the speed of urbanization exceeds that of economic development , " and the emergence of a " new poor alongside urbanization , like in many @entity217 countries			0
" not everyone is impressed with this week 's report on the demographic shifts			0
" @entity30 simply pulled off an urbanization of geographical land mass , not an urbanization of people , " said @entity223 , a @entity30 netizen on @entity224 , a @entity225 - like micro-blogging site			1
" many of our population still live in medieval peasant @entity233 lifestyle and cultural level do not fit modern cities			2
" another micro-blogger frets about food			0
" if we have more urban residents , more people will lose their farm land , " wrote @entity238 , " with less people tilling the land , in a few years the price of rice will be more expensive than housing			2

in 2011 @entity30 counted over 690 million urban dwellers -- 51.27 % of its 1.347 billion people
for the first time , @entity30 's urban population now outnumbers the rural population
@entity30 's rapid economic growth has expanded the size of @entity30 's cities and towns
many experts worry about the enormous pressure on cities ' finances and infrastructure
