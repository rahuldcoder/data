-- a superpower needs a super attention span			0
unfortunately , @entity3 seem to take little interest in the troubles of the world around them , even when those troubles threaten soon to vex @entity3 themselves			2
@entity3 fought two world wars -- and faced nuclear annihilation in a protracted @entity10 -- to defend the freedom of @entity12			2
in the thrilling days of 1989 - 91 , four generations of @entity3 sacrifice were magnificently vindicated			2
the communist regimes of central @entity12 collapsed			0
the @entity16 itself broke apart into smaller and less threatening pieces			2
for four centuries , the rulers of @entity20 had sought security for themselves by dominating first their own people , then their neighbors , then their neighbors ' neighbors , then their neighbors ' neighbors ' neighbors ... until their power extended from @entity31 to the @entity32			2
then , abruptly , that imperial project broke apart			0
subject nations regained their freedom			0
the @entity20 themselves gained a new opportunity -- perhaps the first in their national existence -- to choose a government that served its people			2
@entity43 protesters block government offices , call for strike the former rulers , unfortunately , had other ideas			2
@entity48 did not take root in @entity20 after 1991			1
how and why it failed is a long story , with many villains , but let 's cut to the end result : a former top officer of the @entity56 maneuvered his way into the @entity20 presidency in 1999 - 2000			1
@entity59 restored to power the old secret police apparatus			2
since then , @entity59 and his coterie have attempted to reconstitute as much of the old @entity16 as they could , while plundering @entity20 's wealth for themselves			1
one step to that reconstitution of the @entity16 was absolutely indispensable : reasserting @entity68 's power over @entity43			1
no nation suffered more from @entity16 communism than the @entity43			1
@entity43 farmers lost their lands and homes to @entity16 collectivization in the 1920s ; millions died in the man - made famine that followed in the 1930s			1
their language and culture were stunted under @entity68 rule ; their intellectuals and writers were suppressed , banished , murdered , and defamed			0
in 1991 , @entity43 seized their chance to build a country of their own			2
@entity43 independence liberated not only the @entity43 people , but all @entity12			0
@entity20 without the nearly 46 million people and vast natural resources of the @entity43 is a large and powerful country , but it is no superpower			1
since @entity59 's entry into power , @entity20 minus @entity43 has sought to influence and corrupt the democracies of @entity12			1
a @entity20 that reintegrated @entity43 would possess the power -- like the @entity16 of old -- to intimidate and bully democratic @entity12			1
@entity20 minus @entity43 can aspire to become a normal nation state , a democracy , even a liberal democracy			1
a @entity20 that holds @entity43 by force must forever be a militarized authoritarian regime , a menace to its own people as much as to the rest of the @entity12 continent and the democratic world			1
upholding @entity43 independence is thus a deep concern , not only to the @entity43 , but to all the free countries of @entity12 -- and thus to the @entity3 , free - @entity12 's security and trading partner			1
@entity59 understands all this too , and he does n't like any of it			0
since he came to power , he 's worked to undermine and subvert @entity43 independence			0
@entity43 imports its oil and natural gas from @entity20 , and @entity59 has used energy dependency to sway @entity43 politics and bribe @entity43 's dauntingly corrupt leaders			1
but every once in a while , @entity59 goes too far			0
he went too far in 2004 , collaborating with @entity43 former communists to rig a presidential election			0
blatant fraud inspired @entity43 's famous " @entity125 " -- and a temporary swing in @entity43 's political orientation to the @entity128			0
now @entity59 is trying again -- and again he is meeting massive resistance in the @entity43 streets			1
over the past years , the @entity131 negotiated a trade pact with @entity43			1
the pact would enrich ordinary @entity43 , today the third poorest people in @entity12 , after the @entity134 and @entity135			0
the pact would lessen @entity43 's economic dependence on @entity20 -- and prepare the way for @entity43 's own eventual membership in the @entity131			1
under extreme @entity20 pressure , the @entity43 president -- the very same man whose election fraud triggered the @entity125 nine years ago -- has repudiated his own treaty , and his country 's best hopes			1
tens of thousands of protesters have filled the streets and squares of the capital , @entity152 , two weekends in a row			0
police have suppressed the protests brutally , injuring many people			0
the regime 's controlled courts have banned any further public demonstrations until january			0
@entity162 chancellor @entity161 expressed disappointment in muted tones after a november 28 summit with the @entity43 leadership : " unfortunately not all expectations have been fulfilled			0
we will make very clear here that the @entity131 is ready to accept @entity43 as an associate member , to sign the association treaty			1
we have no hope that it will happen this time , but the door is open			0
" do n't be fooled by the muted words , however			0
what 's at stake in the streets of @entity152 is the future of the @entity12 continent -- and @entity3 prosperity and security			0
an inward - looking @entity3 is averting its attention from its own most important interests and highest ideals			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity187 : @entity48 failed in @entity20 and a top officer of @entity56 , @entity59 , became president
@entity192 : @entity59 and his coterie want to *resurrect* @entity16 and want to keep @entity43 in thrall
@entity192 : @entity43 want to enter @entity131 and lessen dependence on @entity20 ; @entity59 fighting to stop it
he says @entity43 protests met with brutal suppression ; time for @entity3 to *pay* attention
