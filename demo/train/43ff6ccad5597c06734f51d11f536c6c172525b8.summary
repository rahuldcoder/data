or click here to read the transcript			2
below are some key themes identified by @entity0 's military and political commentators and reporters : it is a stunning turnaround from his previous policy - this new strategy represents a turnaround by president @entity2 on so many levels ; there are things the president refused to do that that he is now doing			1
he had said he would not arm @entity5 rebels			0
he had said there would be no air strikes in @entity5			0
now the president says the @entity9 and its coalition will hunt down @entity6 wherever it may be			0
but it is important to note that the president never used the word ' war			0
' he calls this a counter-terror operation - @entity48 - @entity0 chief national security correspondent related : sen. @entity49 has showdown with @entity50 over @entity2 speech on @entity0 it was a speech the president did not want to give - let 's take a step back			1
this is a speech the president never intended to give , did n't want to give , and has been ambivalent about what he ought to do			1
this is a president whose narrative was killing @entity62 and ending two wars			0
what he did tonight when he stepped up to the microphone , he essentially said , " i am going to get involved in large airstrikes over two countries in a conflict that could well outlast his administration			0
there is no end point to this			0
" i think for the president tonight , this was a very difficult speech for him to give			1
- @entity79 - @entity0 chief political analyst related : strong reaction to @entity2 statement ' @entity6 is not @entity11 ' enacting @entity2 's vision presents real issues for the military - i put myself in the position of my friend , gen. @entity86 , @entity87 commander , @entity88			1
what is he hearing right now ? i think what gen. @entity91 was , " let me get this straight			0
you want me to expand operations into a country that is having a civil war , where we do n't like the leader of the country			1
we 're expanding operations in a country that is still having a religious war and has a little bit of turmoil in their government			0
you 're are asking me to train more forces , bring potentially a 40 - member coalition together and conduct air strikes where i do n't hurt innocents			1
" - @entity0 military analyst lt. gen. @entity113 , @entity114 , ret			1
related : as @entity2 prepares for @entity6 fight , where are the doves ? @entity2 was candid about the risks to @entity9 and the military - the president was candid about the threat of @entity6 , the long term nature of the challenge and the risks of military action			1
using @entity127 and @entity128 as examples of the fight against terrorism is understandable given the unpopularity of @entity18 / @entity133 , but critics were quick to say @entity6 is a bigger , more complex challenge			0
more than anything , long term success relies on players that for years have proven unreliable : the @entity18 government , the @entity5 opposition and regional partners , like the @entity142			0
- @entity143 , @entity0 chief national correspondent it strangely threw in a pitch for the @entity9 economy - i thought the first part of the speech as he talked about the attack on @entity6 was strong and presidential and serious			2
you could quibble with it , i am sure there will be disagreements			0
but as a presidential speech , it did very well			2
what surprised me was the second part of the speech when he started to talk about how well the country is doing with jobs and leading around the world			2
i think for an awful lot of people , @entity9 is feeling pretty blue right now			0
i think those kind of assertions do n't ring true to a lot of people			2
it seemed to me it detracted from the main message of the speech			2
- @entity178 - @entity0 commentator and former adviser to presidents from both political parties round - up : did @entity2 sell his @entity6 strategy ?			1

on many levels , this is a turnaround for @entity2
