-- for many @entity2 it 's the journey of a lifetime : making the @entity5 pilgrimage			1
almost 3 million faithful , together , in the city of @entity8 , @entity9			1
but this year , the @entity5 could become an incubator for the @entity12 virus			1
at a @entity15 community center in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity13 @entity2 pray and prepare for the @entity5			1
@entity18 is here with her husband , @entity19			2
they are leaving their children behind but say they look forward to the worship			0
" it is very exciting			0
an amazing experience , " @entity25 says			0
" i am looking forward to worshipping , focusing all my time on worshipping			0
" @entity25 will take precautions to avoid @entity12 , also known as swine flu , at the @entity5			1
they 'll carry hand sanitizer and will be " frequently washing our hands , trying to stay as clean as possible			0
" the @entity25 , along with a number of people at the center who are going on the @entity5 , also are getting @entity12 inoculations			1
dr. @entity38 gives them a short lecture on how to prepare and encourages everyone to have their shots at least seven days before traveling			0
he says the @entity9 government is doing a lot to protect pilgrims , but " the magnitude of the problem is the magnitude of the numbers of people who attend the @entity5			1
" when it comes to using hand sanitizer and wearing masks , @entity38 says he encounters confusion about religious dictates and flu prevention			0
according to @entity15 beliefs , for example , men in a state of pilgrimage should not wear any stitched items or touch alcohol			0
so what about wearing face masks or using alcohol - based sanitizers ? " one of the basic principles on which shariah ( @entity15 law ) is based is the protection of the health , " he says			2
" so if protection of the health is of such paramount importance , then the ritualistic significance of not wearing stitched clothes on your body is subservient to the need to maintain good health			2
and therefore wearing a mask is important			0
using the sanitizer , which prevents this disease from spreading to others , is important			2
" @entity9 has been preparing for the influx of millions of pilgrims			0
it wo n't turn away anyone who wants to come to the @entity5 , but it is urging other countries not to let children younger than 12 , people older than 65 or pregnant women make the pilgrimage			1
the @entity9 health minister went on television with his daughters , publicly getting their @entity12 flu shots , part of a campaign to alleviate fears about the vaccine			1
the kingdom also is using sophisticated technology -- thermal screening equipment at entry points and mobile devices to document suspected cases of the flu			0
dr. @entity106 , assistant deputy to the @entity9 health minister and co-author of a paper on @entity5 and @entity12 published in @entity110 , said the government consulted 25 international experts , who joined with 25 @entity9 experts , to discuss how to prepare			1
" we had the team inspect the airport , the seaport , the regional lab that tests for the influenza , " he said			0
" and then we had a review of all the evidence regarding the different strategies that should be used to prevent the spread of the disease during the mass gathering of the @entity5			1
" we have relied on a collaborative program with the @entity127 , where they are helping us setting up a system that was used in the @entity131 disaster , and i think the system has already been tested and it is working perfectly well			0
" in @entity138 , @entity134 , director of health security and epidemiology at the @entity136 -- which also works to reduce global biological threats -- looks at a report tracking the spread of @entity12 in the @entity141			1
@entity142 describes the risks : " picture , if you can , that 1 million people will come together in a single mosque at any given time during the @entity5			1
picture that crowding over an extended period of time , and that 's a test			2
a test not just for each individual pilgrim , but it is a real test for disease detection			1
" the @entity136 supports a groundbreaking surveillance system in the @entity141 , called the @entity156 on @entity157			0
it brings together public health leaders and representatives from academic institutions and private health care facilities in @entity162 , @entity163 and the @entity164			2
it was started seven years ago , during the height of the @entity163 - @entity164 conflict			0
" they actually started writing a plan for food - borne disease outbreaks , but they started a pandemic preparedness plan , " @entity142 says			2
" when @entity12 came along , this put them in a perfect position , because they were practiced , they were rehearsed and they had built great , great trust			1
" as part of this cooperation , @entity163 is supplying @entity181 and the @entity182 with @entity12 vaccinations for those who make the religious journey			1
that trust , plus international cooperation , will be crucial in protecting pilgrims			0
for those like @entity189 , faith outweighs fear			2
" even if we die there , it is not important , " the @entity192 says			0
" the important thing is to go for the @entity5			2
