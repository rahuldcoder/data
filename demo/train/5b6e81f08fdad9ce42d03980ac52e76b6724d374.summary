-- the future of @entity2 will be decided in @entity4 's @entity3 next week after current owners @entity5 and @entity7 mounted a legal challenge to the proposed buyout by @entity10 ( @entity10 )			1
@entity12 chairman @entity11 announced the sale to the company which owns the @entity15 on wednesday , but the @entity17 co-owners claimed the Â£ 300 million ( $ 476m ) offer " dramatically undervalues " the club			1
@entity5 and @entity7 also allege that the sale , which is subject to @entity21 approval , is not legally binding because two board members who approved the deal had already been sacked			1
but @entity11 says the removal of managing director @entity25 and commercial director @entity26 , and their replacement by @entity5 's son @entity29 and his associate @entity30 , were not valid moves			2
what does the sale mean for @entity2 ? " the key thing is the court case , " @entity11 told the @entity2 website			1
" we need to go to the court to get a declaratory judgment , which is for the court to declare that we did act validly in completing the sale agreement , and then the buyers can complete the sale			0
i would n't have taken the board through that process yesterday if i had n't been confident			0
" meanwhile , @entity10 posted a statement on @entity2 's website in which they confirmed their intention to clear the debt , reported to be between $ 397m and $ 445m , loaded onto the club by @entity7 and @entity5			1
what do you think of the sale ? sound off with @entity55 " @entity10 wants to create a long - term financially solid foundation for @entity2 and is dedicated to ensuring that the club has the resources to build for the future , including the removal of all acquisition debt , " it said			1
" our objective is to stabilize the club and ultimately return @entity2 to its rightful place in @entity67 and @entity68 football , successfully competing for and winning trophies			2
" @entity5 and @entity7 took out loans in the club 's name to buy it in february 2007 , promising to invest in a new stadium and new players			2
blog : jumping from frying pan to fire ? but with the club 's debts spiraling , the stadium project failing to get off the ground and the team struggling on the field , the owners have become targets for angry fans			0
@entity2 failed to qualify for this season 's lucrative @entity88 and the team is currently 18th out of 20 in the @entity67 league after seven matches -- the worst start to a season for decades			0
manager @entity94 , who replaced @entity95 in july , has welcomed the proposed takeover			1
history of @entity2 in images " it 's very positive and of course i 'm delighted , " he said			0
" it 's been going on a long time and i know how hard the board have worked to set things up			0
" i know it 's not easy for them because the owners have other ideas in terms of the sale of the club and what is achievable			0
" but i was delighted to hear the news and have it confirmed that it looks like it is going to go through			0
