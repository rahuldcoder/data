when the @entity1 steamed out of @entity2 earlier this month , it marked @entity4 for an entire class of vessels in the @entity7			1
the @entity9 - class frigate will be the last of more than four dozen such ships to put itself in harm 's way			1
" i am honored and humbled to have this opportunity to lead such a capable and proud group of sailors on this , the final deployment of an ffg - 7 class ship , and to be the last in a great line of frigate commanding officers , " the @entity1 's skipper , @entity19			1
@entity24 , said in a @entity7 statement			0
the final mission for the @entity1 and its crew of 250 will be to combat drug trafficking in the @entity34 's area of responsibility , the waters of the @entity27 and off the coasts of @entity29			1
" what a fitting mission for this great ship and crew to leave as its final legacy , keeping drugs off the streets of @entity29 by stopping them at the source , " @entity24 said			0
after it returns from the drug trafficking mission , the @entity1 will have spent more than 28 years in the @entity7			1
it will be decommissioned in september and possibly put up for sale to an allied navy			0
the first of the @entity51 , the @entity52 , was launched in 1976			0
the @entity7 once had 51 of the @entity9 - class ships , which were up to 453 feet long and displaced as much as 4,300 tons			1
they enjoyed a reputation for toughness , especially after two suffered battle damage in the @entity57 in the late 1980s			2
perhaps the most famous of the @entity9 - class ships was the @entity58 , which survived a deadly attack in the @entity57			1
thirty - seven @entity62 sailors were killed on may 17 , 1987 , when an @entity64 jet fired two @entity66 missiles into the ship while it was on patrol during the @entity69			0
less than a year later , another @entity9 - class frigate , the @entity71 , was struck by an @entity73 mine , wounding 10 of its crew , blowing a 15 - foot hole in its hull and breaking the frigate 's keel , damage that almost always sends a ship to the bottom			1
the crew of the @entity71 , however , was able to save the vessel , in part by using heavy steel cables to tie cracked portions of the ship 's superstructure together			0
the @entity71 was then loaded onto another ship , the @entity91 , in @entity92 and transported back to the @entity62 , ship on ship			0
both the @entity58 and the @entity71 were eventually fully repaired and returned to the fleet			0
the @entity58 was scrapped in 2006			0
the @entity71 completed what is expected to be its final mission in december , with its decommissioning planned for this year			0
the @entity7 defines the primary missions of frigates as protecting shipping and anti-submarine warfare			2
those duties will be taken up by the service 's new littoral combat ships , 20 of which are either in the fleet , under construction or under contract			1
navy secretary @entity111 announced last week that the @entity112 will succeed the @entity9 - class frigates in more than mission			1
" somehow , in the 21st century , we started naming ships with strange acronyms ... instead of from our naval traditions ... so we are going to change the hull designation of the ‪ # ‎ @entity112 ‬ ‬ class ships to @entity126 ( frigate ) ... appropriate and traditional name , " @entity111 said in a speech to the @entity117 's annual symposium			2
those newly designated frigates will join the world 's oldest active warship in the @entity7 's frigate fleet , the @entity132			2
nicknamed " @entity134 , " the @entity7 's historic tall - masted showpiece was commissioned in 1797 and sails from @entity135 to promote the service .			2

the @entity1 's deployment is the last for @entity9 - class frigates
@entity9 - class frigates have been in the @entity7 for almost *40* years
in the 1980s , attacks nearly sank two @entity9 - class frigates in the @entity57
navy secretary says littoral combat ships will be the new frigates
