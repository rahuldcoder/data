-- science has brought us incredible gifts : life - saving vaccines and clean water , air travel and instant communication			0
modern life is built upon the knowledge that the scientific community has gathered and that society -- markets , governments , workers -- put to use			0
we have our ancestors to thank			0
but will our descendants thank us ? have we put to good use the knowledge we are gaining today to help those who will come after us ? that question is now before one of the highest courts of the @entity23			1
as a scientist who has spent the past half - century documenting how mankind is fundamentally altering our climate , i fear that unless the courts understand the threat and require the government to produce a plan of action , the answer of history could be damning			1
in a new study , i and my co-authors make indisputably clear what the world 's scientists have increasingly warned : our climate is changing , and the impacts are growing			1
the changes harm humans and threaten other life on the planet			2
our study , published in the prestigious peer - reviewed science journal @entity47 , was written in support of a lawsuit against the federal government			0
the plaintiffs are young people , those to whom we are handing an increasingly warmer and destabilized planet			2
they argue that they have a constitutional right to a safe climate , that they have a right to receive from us a planet that supports all life , just as our forebears gave us			1
it is correctly a legal argument , but it relates to a fundamental moral question			0
we know without a doubt that gases we are adding to the air have caused a planetary energy imbalance and global warming , already 0.8 degrees @entity68 since pre-industrial times			0
this warming is driving an increase in extreme weather , from heat waves and droughts to wildfires and stronger storms ( though mistakenly expecting science to instantly document links to specific events misses the forest for the trees )			0
more than simply listing calamitous threats , we wanted to jump - start the discussion of how the world can take significant action			0
@entity85 , the good news			0
we still have time to choose			2
will we seek out and exploit ever deeper and dirtier fossil fuels or phase in cleaner carbon - free energy ? if we start aggressively reducing carbon emissions , we can stabilize our climate and avoid cataclysmic change			1
our fate truly is in our hands			0
our analysis shows that we must rapidly reduce carbon emissions and improve land management policies to restore billions of tons of carbon to soils and forests			1
we recognize that wo n't be easy			0
carbon emissions will decline only if the price of fossil fuels begins to include their costs to society : their effects on human health and climate			1
economic analysis shows that a rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies would swiftly drive market innovations and investments in clean energy			1
( indeed , many companies are preparing for such a fee			1
) watch out for climate surprises , scientists warn courts can not tell the government how to reduce emissions			1
but they can require that the government provide a plan : how will emissions be reduced to assure that the rights of young people are protected ? there is also painfully challenging news			2
the widely accepted goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees @entity68 would lead to continually receding shorelines and growing climate extremes			2
we must , instead , keep maximum warming close to 1 degree @entity68			0
thus , most of the allowed carbon emissions budget has been used up			1
we must phase out coal emissions			1
and it would be foolhardy to develop unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands			1
in short , our analysis finds that we must act more quickly and more aggressively than politicians and international negotiators have even considered			0
my co-authors are experts on biology , ecology , law , economics , public health , climate modeling , oceanography and paleoclimatology			2
we need broad expertise because climate change is not just a science problem			2
it is the great challenge of our times			0
climate change warriors : it 's time to go nuclear climate change is altering people 's lives , right now , from the @entity23 to @entity170 to the @entity171			1
it is as clear and present a danger as we 've ever seen			0
and the threat will only get worse if left unchecked			0
if we allow the planet 's energy imbalance to increase and the ocean to continue to warm , we will pass a point of no return			1
our children and grandchildren would inherit disintegrating ice sheets , rising seas that inundate all coastal cities , increasingly violent climate extremes and extermination of countless species			2
we would leave future generations a far more desolate planet than the one that we were blessed to inherit			1
@entity192 and the knowledge it brings is a gift only if we use it			0
failing to act on our knowledge to protect future generations would be the gravest injustice of all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			1

@entity201 : we know what to do to prevent climate catastrophe
ending emissions from coal and stopping development of tar sands are key , he says
it 's time to establish a fee for companies that emit carbon , @entity201 says
hansen : it would be *unjust* to bequeath to our descendants a desolate planet
