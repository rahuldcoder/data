-- @entity3 explorer @entity1 knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern @entity3 's remote @entity6			1
what the 27 - year - old from @entity8 , @entity9 , did n't expect was to find himself hurtling over a 20 - foot waterfall that had never been documented -- and then go on to discover six more waterfalls after fixing his canoe			1
the nearly 100 - kilometer long @entity6 is a tributary of @entity16 's @entity15 , part of @entity3 's @entity18			1
it 's one of the largest roadless areas on earth outside @entity22 , says @entity1 , containing rivers so remote that even today there are a few that have escaped accurate mapping -- including the @entity29			1
" the expedition was five years in the making , " he says			0
" extensive research went into it , looking through explorers ' records , @entity36 notes , speaking directly with aboriginal elders			0
" but his research did n't offer any hints as to the dangers that lay ahead			0
even @entity44 's low - resolution satellite imagery , all that 's available for this remote part of @entity3 , is deficient for detecting waterfalls			1
" the plan was to explore the river , record information about flora and fauna , rapids and the geography in general , " he says			2
" i knew there would be lots of whitewater rapids , but no one knew that waterfalls existed on the river			1
" ' yikes , this is going to be bad ! ' with the support of the @entity61 , @entity1 conducted two reconnaissance expeditions to the area ( one in 2008 and another in 2009 ) , exploring the wilderness around the @entity6			1
but he was n't able to canoe the @entity29 , as just getting to the river 's isolated headwaters is a challenge that involves a few days of bushwhacking and creek - hopping			1
" in august 2012 , i went back , this time alone , determined to canoe the river no matter what , " he says			1
" the seven waterfalls were so unexpected and special			2
" the first waterfall @entity1 found -- before it was too late to go around it -- was 20 - feet high			1
of the six he went on to discover , the highest was 40 - feet high			1
" my first thought when i realized i was being swept over a waterfall was , ' wow ! what an amazing discovery ! the @entity61 will be thrilled ! " he recalls			1
" the second thought was , ' yikes ! this is going to be bad ! ' i realized i could n't escape from the current so i just braced myself for the drop			0
" @entity1 says he was sucked underwater beneath the fall " for longer than was comfortable			1
" he resurfaced , out of breath , and spotted his canoe upside down in an eddy near the riverbank			2
" i swam to shore , recovered most of my gear -- except my hat , fishing rod and some moccasins -- and then set about repairing my canoe			2
" once i got my breath , that is			0
it took about an hour and a half to get the canoe back in shape and ready to continue downriver			2
" return to the scene of discovery this week , @entity1 is heading back to the @entity6 to continue his work for the @entity61 ( @entity61 )			1
he 'll retrace his route and photograph , measure and document the precise location of each waterfall so that they can be added to topographical maps , pending verification from spot satellite imagery			0
" this expedition is geographical exploration in the truest sense : @entity1 's work will change the map of @entity3 -- a rarity in 21st century exploration , " says the @entity61			1
technology is helping explorers make discoveries in an era when significant finds are incredibly rare			0
most recently , in june of this year , archaeologists announced they 'd found a huge medieval city buried beneath impenetrable jungle on a remote mountain in @entity128 , @entity129			0
it would n't have been discovered but for the help of a remote sensing laser instrument			0
though @entity1 says gadgets are useful in the field , it 's important not to rely on them completely			2
" modern electronic gear and other gadgetry is no substitute for traditional skills and knowledge , " he says			0
" in the beginning , i never used a gps , only map and compass , sun and stars			0
now i have a gps , but i do n't rely on it			0
" a satellite phone allows me to communicate from the wilderness , but it does n't work in the forest or in the rain , so it has limitations and i try not to rely on it			0
" i use a modified theodolite , designed by my engineer father , to measure waterfall heights			0
" he also relies on aerial photographs and satellite imagery when planning expeditions , " but ultimately , they are no substitute for old - fashioned ' boots - on - the - ground ' exploration			0
" for those with their own @entity167 dreams , it 's not too late to get into the game , says @entity1			2
" the age of exploration will never be truly over -- the oceans , caves , @entity22 , so much of northern @entity3 -- it will take a long time to explore , " he says			2
" new species are still discovered , and then there will always be archeology , paleontology , science -- imagination is the only limit really			0

explorer @entity1 , 27 , finds seven uncharted waterfalls on remote @entity3 river
@entity61 says discovery will change the map of @entity3
