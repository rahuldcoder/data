the @entity2 military is ending its policy of excluding women from combat and will " expeditiously " open combat jobs and direct combat units to female troops , defense secretary @entity0 announced thursday			1
women already are on the front lines overseas despite an official ban on combat , " and the time has come for our policies to recognize that reality , " @entity0 told reporters at the @entity17			1
" the fact is , they have become an integral part of our ability to perform our mission , and for more than a decade of war they have demonstrated courage and skill and patriotism , " @entity0 said			1
gen. @entity29 , the chairman of the @entity30 , said the decision would be implemented " over time and with careful analysis			0
" but he said the service chiefs were unanimous in their support for the move			1
officials told @entity38 on wednesday that not every position will open all at once			2
once the policy is changed , the @entity17 will enter what is being called an " assessment phase , " in which each branch of service will examine all its jobs and units not currently integrated and then produce a timetable for integrating them			2
the @entity50 and @entity51 , especially , will be examining physical standards and gender - neutral accommodations within combat units			1
every 90 days , the service chiefs will have to report on their progress			0
the move is one of the last significant policy decisions made by @entity0 , who is expected to leave in mid-february			1
it is not clear where former sen. @entity62 , the nominated replacement , stands , but officials say he has been apprised of @entity0 's coming announcement			1
" it will take a while to work out the mechanics in some cases			0
we expect some jobs to open quickly , by the end of this year			2
others , like special operations forces and infantry , may take longer , " a senior defense official explained			0
@entity0 is setting the goal of january 2016 for all assessments to be complete and women to be integrated as much as possible			1
and the @entity17 has left itself some wiggle room that may ultimately lead to some jobs being designated as closed to women			1
a senior defense official said if , after the assessment , a branch finds that " a specific job or unit should not be open , they can go back to the secretary and ask for an exemption to the policy , to designate the job or unit as closed			0
" the official said the goal remains to open as many jobs as possible			2
" we should open all specialties to the maximum extent possible to women			2
we know they can do it			0
" sen. @entity104 , an @entity106 @entity105 who spent six years as a prisoner of war during the @entity108 , said he supports lifting the ban on women serving in combat , pointing out women are already serving in harm 's way			1
but he said the move should not fundamentally change the military			1
" as this new rule is implemented , it is critical that we maintain the same high standards that have made the @entity2 military the most feared and admired fighting force in the world -- particularly the rigorous physical standards for our elite special forces units , " @entity104 said in a statement			1
but sen. @entity126 , @entity127 called @entity0 's decision a " historic step for equality " that recognizes the role women play in the military			1
@entity134 leads the @entity135 and is a member of the @entity137			1
the @entity17 must notify @entity138 of each job or unit as it is sent up to the secretary to be opened to women			2
then the @entity17 must wait 30 days while @entity138 is in session before implementing the change			0
it is a marked difference from the way the military ended the exclusion of gays serving openly , or the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			2
in that case , there were no stipulations attached to openly gay service members			0
there was no staggered approach that integrated openly gay troops into units			0
it was instead done all at once , across the board			0
a senior defense official explained the @entity17 's reasoning behind the different approach : " you 're talking about personal choice of behavior versus physical capability			0
and they were already in the units			0
if you take a unit that 's never had women before , that 's quite a culture change			2
" another senior defense official said the goal is " to provide a level , gender - neutral playing field			0
" the @entity177 recently filed a federal lawsuit against the @entity17 , charging that combat exclusion is unfair and outdated , harms @entity2 's safety and prevents women from receiving training and recognition for their work			1
the plaintiffs , who include women awarded @entity187 , say the exclusion places them at a disadvantage for promotion			2
the @entity177 said was thrilled about @entity0 's announcement			1
" but we welcome this statement with cautious optimism , as we hope that it will be implemented fairly and quickly so that servicewomen can receive the same recognition for their service as their male counterparts , " @entity192 , senior staff attorney with the @entity193 , said in the statement			0
earlier this month , the @entity50 opened the @entity202 to women , and it has begun recruiting female pilots and crew chiefs			0
the @entity206 has put its first female officers on submarines in the past year , and certain female ground troops have been attached to combat units in @entity211 and @entity212			0
more than 800 women were wounded in those wars , and at least 130 have died .			0

sen. @entity104 supports the move and says the military must keep its high standards
sen. @entity134 points out women already serve in combat
officials say @entity0 will announce it is opening combat jobs to women
@entity0 hopes the process will be complete by january 2016 , officials say
