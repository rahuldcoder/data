-- when my parents bought their first mobile phones about 10 years ago , i did n't think they 'd ever get the hang of using them			1
@entity6 would answer my call from the front of the line at @entity10 and say , " hello darling , yes i 'll take the tall thanks , what is it , @entity15 do you have any cash ? " all in one breath			1
my favorite were the random , cryptic one - word text messages like " i " or " soon " or " shirtt			1
" but things have changed			1
these days mom sends texts saying : " video chat in 5 ? " ( insert smiley face )			1
of course it 's not me she wants to see in the chat window on her computer screen			1
it 's my 2 - year - old daughter , @entity30			1
video chats have become routine when my parents are at their home in @entity33			1
@entity34 will pick up colorful objects -- a @entity37 figurine , a sombrero , a bird feeder -- and move them toward his laptop 's tiny camera lens , making @entity30 squeal or say , " what 's that funny thing , @entity45 ? " and mom will hold up an outfit she bought for her granddaughter to see if it meets our approval ( it usually does )			1
my in - laws are slowly getting into it , too			1
unable to attend @entity30 's first birthday party , they watched us from laptops we set up on top of bookshelves			1
from their homes in @entity61 , @entity62 , and the remote @entity63 , they watched @entity30 slap her teeny hand into her cake 's white frosting as everyone sang happy birthday			2
every now and then , we 'd look up and wave or raise a glass of champagne			2
becoming grandparents is n't the sole reason my parents have become technically savvy -- mom had a @entity74 before @entity30 came along -- but it has likely sped things up			1
they were quick to take on @entity76 when my husband ( who , full disclosure , works for @entity80 ) suggested it as an easier option for us to chat face to face online			1
they now school their fellow baby boomer pals in @entity85 and @entity86 on how to use it , to varying degrees of success			1
and mom is now more adept at navigating @entity92 than i am -- when she 's babysitting @entity30 and a request ( read : demand ) comes down for the @entity96 rendition of " @entity97 " featuring the little owl , mom will bring it up on the tv screen quicker than you can say , " holy diaper rash			2
" ( mind you , @entity30 is figuring all this out just as quickly			2
she knows that slamming a laptop shut concludes a chat she deems to be getting dull -- adorable when you 're in the room with her , not so funny if you 've been hung up on			2
) for grandparents who are online -- and a recent @entity110 study suggests 53 % of @entity112 adults over 65 are , with one in three of those seniors using social networks -- living apart from grandkids does n't mean never seeing them			1
@entity116 , 62 , of @entity117 , @entity118 , says she feared she and her husband , @entity119 , would be strangers to their 4 - year - old grandson because he lives in @entity122			2
so she got into @entity123			2
" my family would laugh at me , because when ( my grandson ) was just beginning to move around , i was happy just to sit and watch him without any dialogue going on , " @entity124 says			2
" we 've watched him learn to ride his bike , play ball , learn to write his name , play with his trucks			2
... we often eat together , although they are two hours behind us			2
" and let 's not forget the wonders of virtual babysitting			2
" my daughter is a single mom , so i have even kept ( my grandson ) ' occupied ' for a few minutes while she got dinner started or put a load of laundry in , " @entity124 says			0
" i like my @entity141 because it 's so portable and easy to use			0
i have shown him an interesting bug on our deck , what the new carpet looks like , and how high the snow is at our house			0
my own kids were raised with long - distance grandparents , and there is little comparison to the advantages we have now			1
" @entity156 , 65 , from @entity157 , @entity158 , is active on @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and has her own blogging website			1
and in spite of her initial reluctance , she 's taken to texting as a way to stay in touch with two of her out - of - town grandchildren , who are 8 and 10			0
" i can not quite get the hang of abbreviating words , and incorrect punctuation is difficult for me to ignore , " she says			0
" but i am giving in to not capitalizing words			0
my thumb dexterity is still lacking			0
" @entity156 has also tried @entity176 for video calls and notes that her grandchildren never comment on her tech willingness			0
likely , she says , they expect everyone to know as much as they do or more			0
" i think i 'm just your average grandma in awe of the ease with which these kids have transcended a world i came to know later in life			0
" i sometimes wonder if it 's odd for my parents to see their granddaughter expertly scroll through photos on my @entity195 with her miniature finger			0
after all , it freaks me out			0
while the @entity199 has held my hand through my adult life , my childhood was devoid of doodads ( unless you count the portable @entity204 console my brother and i used to fight over )			0
@entity206 , editor - in - chief at @entity207 , refers to the key generation in technological proliferation as " digital natives			1
" " these are the people who over the next five years will enter adulthood , who know nothing but the digital experience , " he says			0
" it 's completely natural for them to share everything			0
it 's natural for them to expect whatever they can see on a big screen they can see on a small screen , to have access to every bit of information they need in the palm of their hands			0
they do n't even imagine anything other than that			0
those are the people that are going to transform society			0
" for now then , grandkids and parents would do well to take advantage of something the baby boomers still seem to hold dear -- balance			1
while they might embrace technology to stay in the mix and because they enjoy it , they 're also big fans of powering down			1
@entity124 says she still occasionally writes letters on paper to post to her grandson in @entity122 and visits whenever she and her husband can			0
and when my parents are spending time in @entity254 , they bring @entity255 , crayons and books			0
@entity45 takes her to the park and pushes her on the swing , her hair blowing in 10 different directions			0
you know ... stuff that does n't require an on - off switch			0
has having grandchildren spurred you to improve your grasp of new technology ? share your experience in the comments section below .			1

becoming grandparents can urge baby boomers to adopt new technology
@entity110 study finds 53 % of @entity112 adults over 65 are online
a balance between *traditional* means of *communication* and newer methods can be key
