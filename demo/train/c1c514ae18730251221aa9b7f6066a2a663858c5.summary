-- former @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has said millions of dollars from the " extreme right wing " in the @entity4 helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the @entity7			1
in an exclusive interview aired friday with @entity0 's @entity9 , @entity1 said his attempts to make peace had been " a killer " for him as prime minister			1
in 2008 , @entity1 sought a " full comprehensive peace between us and the @entity7 " -- a two - state solution based on the 1967 borders			1
but the plan was never realized and @entity1 was forced from office accused of corruption , which he denies			1
" it was a killer for me , not only because of the opposition in @entity2			0
i think that , by the way , in @entity2 , the majority of the @entity2 would have supported my plan , had it come for elections , " @entity1 said			1
" but i had to fight against superior powers , including millions and millions of dollars that were transferred from this country ( the @entity4 ) by figures which were from the extreme right wing that were aimed to topple me as prime minister of @entity2			1
there is no question about it			0
" pressed to name names , @entity1 replied : " next time			2
" asked if current prime minister @entity38 would be willing to propose such a plan , given the same political risks , @entity1 said it was the responsibility of a leader to put his country first			1
" that 's why you are prime minister , " said @entity1			1
" that 's why you take the responsibility of leadership			0
to do things which are right for the nation that you want to lead			0
" but @entity1 acknowledged that such leadership comes at a price			2
" i paid personally , dearly			0
but there was no option for me but to do what i did			0
and i know for sure , and i know the names , of the people that spent millions of dollars in order to stop me -- from the @entity4			1
" he was then asked if there is still time for a two - state solution			1
" there is time , " said @entity1 , " but time is running out			2
" he admits that @entity66 , president of the @entity67 , never said yes to his 2008 proposal , but also insists that he never said no. " so why not reintroduce this plan again , and present the challenge to the @entity7 ? " asked @entity1			1
he said he hoped his successor , @entity38 , would adopt his peace proposal -- which included the division of @entity74 , which both @entity2 and @entity7 claim as their capital -- but that so far this had not happened			2
" the fact is that we do n't negotiate with the @entity7			0
and the fact is that we have not proposed anything , " he said			0
@entity1 suggested the current @entity2 government was content to blame the @entity7 for a reluctance to negotiate , rather than striving for a peace deal which is of great importance to @entity2			1
we want to separate from the @entity7 , " he said			0
" we do n't want to control the lives of the @entity7			0
we want them to have their own separate state and we have to do everything in our power in order to bring it about			0
" @entity1 said it broke his heart to propose the division of @entity74 , which he served as mayor from 1993 to 2003			2
but the difficult decision was necessary , he said			0
" for me to propose a division of @entity74 was really terrible			0
i did it because i reached a conclusion that without which there will not be peace			0
" asked if @entity38 will seek such a peace , @entity1 said , " i certainly pray that he will			2
" then he added , " i doubt that he will			0
" @entity1 was indicted on a variety of corruption charges in 2008 in a probe that dogged his last months in office			1
he held several @entity111 posts under then - prime minister @entity112 , who has been in a coma since a stroke in 2006			1
@entity1 succeeded @entity112 after his stroke			2
@entity1 announced his resignation in september 2008 , after the corruption investigation deepened , and left office after a new government took power in march 2009			1
other corruption allegations have followed			1
@entity1 declined to discuss the charges with @entity0			2
he has denied wrongdoing in all cases .			0
