the founder of the @entity1 may not be the world 's most prolific micro-blogger -- but @entity7 's " this is for everyone " tweet at the @entity9 opening ceremony set the tone for what has been dubbed the first " social media games			1
" in an interview with @entity16 , the @entity14 computer scientist who invented the web in 1989 said he was deeply moved to be honored for his pioneering role in the digital revolution -- and hopes the combination of the @entity1 and the @entity20 can create a new understanding between people across the world			1
" the web is about connecting people through technology , not about documents , " @entity7 told @entity16			2
" the @entity20 are about connecting people too			0
it would be nice if the @entity20 bring people to use the @entity1 to understand each other , break down national and cultural barriers and look at each other from a more beautiful point of view			2
" there were more tweets during the opening ceremony of the @entity38 than during the entire @entity39 in 2008			1
many of @entity42 's 900 million users shared photos and comments about the event , and millions more in @entity46 took to @entity48 - like " @entity47 " to air their takes on the show			2
more : how hashtags are shaping the @entity51 @entity7 was approached by fellow @entity53 @entity52 -- the @entity54 - winning film - maker who directed the opening ceremony -- last year about making an appearance			1
during the dazzling " @entity57 and june say ... thanks @entity7 " segment of the show , a @entity14 pop music - filled tribute to the digital revolution , the house that was the centerpiece of the act levitated off the ground to reveal @entity62 sitting at a computer			1
@entity7 then sent his " this is for everyone " message -- @entity52 's idea , according to the scientist -- which lit up more than 70,000 led panels around the stadium and was re-tweeted more than 10,000 times online			1
" i was honored to be asked but it was also amazing to be part of this huge piece of amateur drama with thousands of people on stage , " @entity7 said			2
" we only had three run - throughs ( of the ceremony ) , but luckily i had probably the simplest part anybody has ever had in any show ever			2
i had to basically press " run , " type a little and it 's done			0
it was a bit nerve - wracking but very exciting			1
" more : decoding the @entity9 opening ceremony @entity7 would n't bite when asked about the irony of @entity93 commentators not knowing who he was and instructing viewers to look him up on the @entity1			1
" if you have n't heard of him , we have n't either , " declared @entity97 's @entity96 before co-commentator @entity98 told viewers in @entity93 to " @entity100 him			0
" @entity7 refused to criticize @entity97 for the gaffe , and said : " i am terrible at remembering people and places myself , so i ca n't really blame anyone for that			2
" born and raised in @entity107 , @entity7 said his invention was " one of the many things in the show that @entity14 can be proud of -- and an essential thing of it was that it was an open thing , it was n't something that could be controlled by any one government			1
" @entity7 , who co-founded and is the director of both @entity117 and the @entity118 -- devoted to improving and furthering the potential of the @entity1 -- has called for governments to be more transparent in how they release data , and is also critical of government censorship of information on the internet			1
more : get latest results at @entity16 's @entity126 " censorship is generally a bad thing			0
a strong government is one which is able to allow the people in a country to access reality , go onto the internet and see and discuss how things really are , " he told @entity16			0
" a more weak government is one that 's so worried it has to control info from its own citizens -- i think that 's a pity when and where it happens			0
and i think with time we 'll see that go away , bit by bit			0
i think we 'll see information get around these blocks			0
and after awhile governments realize that for the country to work , economically , it 's got to be open			0
" his message during the opening ceremony may have been " for everyone , " but @entity7 is quick to point out that the @entity1 is only used by a quarter of the world 's population			1
" is it really for everyone ? only 25 % of people ( globally ) use the @entity1 and the other 75 % do n't , " he said			0
" it 's a question of how fast can we actually get the other 75 % as part of the information society			0
" @entity7 says the @entity118 is focused on closing that gap			0
more : welcome to the @entity20 " @entity167 is working with other foundations to see what we can to do get people using the web on mobile , to get entrepreneurs in @entity176 building websites , to get people to be able to pick their villages up from poverty , " he said			0
much like the development of the @entity1 , @entity7 believes the @entity181 will be remembered for the tremendous collaboration of volunteers			1
and while @entity7 is n't the world 's biggest micro-blogger , he says his opening ceremony tweet got him another 50,000 followers on @entity48			1
" i should tweet more -- i tend to tweet when i see things related to the open web , " he laughs , " but i do n't tweet about what i had for breakfast			0
