-- @entity1 was magnificent last night addressing the @entity3 convention			1
she did everything that party strategists could have desired , presenting herself as an articulate and passionate advocate for her husband , who should now seem more " likeable " than he did before her speech			1
having once ghost - written words for men who ran for president ( @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 ) , i admired the craftsmanship : " his name is @entity19 , and you really should get to know him			1
" she proved herself a great salesperson			1
yet he -- not she -- has the name on the november ballot for president of the @entity25			0
similarly , we can admire @entity27 , but we will vote for or against her husband			1
as for mrs. @entity1 's reach : this was a convention speech , and conventions stopped being interesting to other than the political class when their outcomes stopped being surprising			1
conventions attract the party 's faithful			1
in this election , the polls tell us that there are very few undecided voters			1
the vast majority of her listeners have already made up their minds			0
my first conventions were in 1952 in @entity48 , where both the @entity3 and @entity49 were meeting			2
i was a college student working there			0
when we entered the hall on @entity54 , we did not know who would be nominated on @entity56			0
opinion : @entity1 stole the show on opening night that was the last time this happened in @entity25 political history			1
the candidates : @entity13 and @entity63			0
not every home had a tv set , but every tv set stayed on far into the night			0
my hunch is that this could n't be claimed last night			2
when a long line of speakers preceded mrs. @entity1 , my wife and i started channel - surfing			1
the convention had a lot of competition			0
candidates ' wives have been a force -- not a factor -- since @entity80 was given her own campaign bus and agenda in 1964			1
it would have been unseemly to have asked @entity84 to take to the road or @entity87 's @entity86 before her			2
@entity14 , a charming presence , smiled , laughed at the same joke that @entity90 told in every speech , and otherwise remained silent			2
@entity92 was briefly a factor in 1992 when @entity94 announced , " @entity95 , get one free			2
" the suggestion was instantly shot down , and never resurrected			0
politics : @entity19 gaining buzz among women on @entity100 the genius of the @entity25 electorate is in how voters ultimately sort out what is necessary to make a decision , and what is not , discarding the detritus of evening news sound bites , and rhetoric regurgitated on late night panels during the country 's endless process of choosing a president			1
@entity114 was not elected because of his memorable one - liners			0
" there you go , again			0
" nor was @entity118 defeated because he looked silly riding around in a tank			0
it 's fun to compare the @entity123 ' touching kiss last night to @entity124 and @entity126 's back - bender at the 2000 @entity49 convention			2
these are all part of the show			2
some people are well paid to produce the ads and provide the other services for the show			2
others are paid to report them			0
many enjoy what a newspaper columnist of my youth called " the great game of politics			2
" still , after a half century of observing @entity25 voters , i find it uncanny how they always gravitate to what 's the most important to them			1
which brings us to what the 2012 election is all about			0
how we feel in our gut about which candidate is more likely to put @entity25 back to work and revive the economy			0
there is usually a slight upward bump in the polls after a convention			0
but it soon settles back down			0
the only events -- other than what pundits call " unanticipated consequences " such as a homeland terrorist attack -- that could influence the outcome will be the debates where the candidates directly challenge each other			0
opinion : where @entity1 's speech veered off - track if @entity19 wins , a majority prefer his economic message			1
if @entity19 loses , he will still know that no other candidate 's wife ever worked so hard to explain her husband to the @entity25 people			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

@entity184 : @entity1 did great job with speech ; should help with @entity19 's " likability "
he says conventions mainly for the political class ; most voters wo n't have watched
he says wives can be a force , not a factor ; voters ultimately vote what 's important to them
@entity184 : political process is a show ; whoever *persuades* voters on jobs issue will win
