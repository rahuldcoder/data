@entity0 -- wearing hooded sweatshirts , baseball hats and sports gear , the five young men alternated between nodding their heads to the rhythm and taking hold of the microphone to pour out their anger , their insights , their pain			1
" no matter if you 're @entity15 , no matter if you 're @entity17 , no matter the religion , we all are human , " intones @entity13			0
the scene and sounds would n't be unusual in many @entity22 cities , where rap has been part of urban culture for decades			0
members of the @entity29 , as the quintet calls itself , are aware that their music may seem out of place in @entity32			1
traditionally , the @entity34 country is better known for sounds emanating from instruments like the oud and rebab , rather than from a microphone or turntable			0
yet this group not only embraces @entity22 culture , it literally speaks its language -- modeling @entity22 idols @entity45 and the late @entity47 , and rapping exclusively in @entity48 rather than the native tongue of @entity50			1
the reason for that choice is that they want people in the @entity55 to understand what 's really happening in their homeland			2
" it 's ... a message to the @entity55 ... to make them know who we are , things we can do here -- not just the violence , the terrorists , " said @entity58 , or @entity59 , the group 's 19 - year - old founder			1
beyond speaking @entity48 , they feel that rap offers them an authentic , powerful medium to express what they see and how they feel			1
that 's why , for the past two years , the friends say they have recorded self - written tracks inside a small studio and rapped at outside venues			0
while they hope their music will catch on , for now they say they fund the effort themselves			0
during a recent performance before a small audience in a city field , the dark side of @entity0 was woven into many of their lyrics , as is the sentiment than many outside @entity32 do n't really understand what the situation is like			1
rapped one member , " we livin ' in hell and nobody hears our calls ; everyday in @entity0 , our tears do fall			2
" the hurt , and thus the lyrics , are raw and personal for men like @entity13 , or @entity104			0
his best friend @entity105 , a 25 - year - old neighbor whom he worked with at a newspaper , was among 70 killed on october 31 , when militants stormed @entity0 's @entity109 , or @entity110			1
afterward , he penned a rap railing against the attackers who " in the name of @entity114 ( tried ) to kill my brother , " as well as the " dead bodies in the streets			0
" a muslim , @entity104 said he grew up with many @entity17 friends , who have been increasingly targeted around the country because of their religion			0
the church siege , and the violence overall , hit him hard			1
but he said that he 's glad to have an outlet with the @entity29 , not just to voice his feelings but also to bond with friends			2
" the most important thing is they are really , really good guys , " @entity104 said of his fellow group members			2
" it 's really hard to find people with good hearts , big hearts			0

@entity29 is an @entity48 rap group based in @entity0
its five members rap about life in @entity32 , aiming to send " a message to the @entity55 "
one member says some of his lyrics are *inspired* by the deadly october 31 church siege
