@entity0 -- police arrested at least 250 protesters and an opposition leader in @entity6 's capital tuesday in a second day of demonstrations against parliamentary election results			1
protesters decried what they described as electoral fraud in sunday 's national vote , which kept prime minister @entity14 's party in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in parliament			1
@entity20 , a former deputy prime minister turned vocal government opponent , told @entity1 he was among those detained at a rally			2
@entity14 's @entity25 party held a separate demonstration			1
police said there were about 8,000 people there			1
tuesday 's @entity32 protests drew much smaller crowds than a similar rally in @entity0 monday , where thousands of demonstrators turned out for an event state news agency @entity37 described as the largest opposition demonstration in years			1
protesters who turned out tuesday were met with a firm response from security forces , who dispersed many and made arrests			0
but some analysts said the presence of protesters was a significant sign that could prove a turning point in @entity6 politics			0
@entity50 's piece on the significance of the election " this is n't a surprise that the party got fewer votes			1
i think the real surprise are the number of people who went out on the street , " said @entity57 , a senior international adviser at the @entity59 firm			1
as simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over , @entity14 has promised to make changes , including reshuffling his @entity69			1
he said the losses his party suffered in sunday 's elections were inevitable			1
" they are unavoidable for any political power , especially a political power that has held the responsibility for the state of a country for some time , " he said after results were announced			0
one observer said sunday 's election results , which left @entity25 with a slim majority in the 450 - seat house , signal that the leader 's grip on power was weakening			1
" whatever else they reveal , sunday 's results undercut the image , common in the @entity94 , of @entity14 's regime as an effective authoritarian state , " @entity50 , professor of political science at the @entity88 , @entity89 , wrote in a column for @entity1			1
" in fact , it is a regime that can not even steal an election decisively			0
" demonstrators at post-election rallies in @entity0 and other @entity6 cities criticized widespread reports of ballot - rigging			0
" what you 're seeing ... are expectations of a middle class , of people who believe they have a right to participate in their political process			2
and the real tragedy of having people going out on the streets and express their frustration is that was the only avenue left to them , " said @entity57 , who helped develop the @entity113 ' policy towards @entity6 during the @entity115 administration			2
the opposition other @entity6 party sent out invitations to the protest via @entity125 under the title " is the @entity127 ? yes ! " but @entity128 , deputy director of the @entity6 and @entity129 at the @entity130 , cautioned that this week 's protests were fueled by the frustrations of a " liberal fringe , " not the majority of the population			1
" the bulk of @entity6 still have enough to lose right now in the system , and still have negative memories of the last time a government went down			0
they 're not terribly interested in feeding chaos , " he said			0
" it 's not the @entity144 on the streets of @entity0			2
" a preliminary report from the @entity147 on sunday 's election said some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was " slanted in favor of the ruling party			2
" a draft report by the organization 's election - observer mission details alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes , manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors			2
the group , which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights in @entity163 , cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media			0
and there was " undue interference of state authorities " in the vote , the 56 - member organization said in a statement			0
speaking at a meeting of the organization in @entity175 , @entity176 , earlier tuesday , @entity113 secretary of state @entity177 called for a " full investigation " of reported fraud and intimidation in the elections , citing " serious concern " about the vote			0
" the @entity6 people , like people everywhere , deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted , " @entity115 said , as @entity6 foreign minister @entity184 looked on			0
" and that means they deserve free , fair , transparent elections and leaders who are accountable to them			0
" @entity6 's @entity193 dismissed the criticism tuesday , saying " statements of @entity113 secretary of state @entity177 concerning the parliamentary elections in @entity6 , as well as similar comments of the @entity199 and @entity200 officials , are unacceptable			2
" @entity6 expects that " the @entity113 will refrain from unfriendly invectives going against the common positive vector of development of our bilateral relations , " the ministry said in an online statement			0
shortly after @entity115 spoke , the @entity208 announced that @entity14 's party suffered a large loss of seats in the election			1
@entity25 will have 238 seats , down from more than 300 in the outgoing parliament , or @entity216 , @entity208 head @entity213 announced , with 99.99 % of ballots counted			1
