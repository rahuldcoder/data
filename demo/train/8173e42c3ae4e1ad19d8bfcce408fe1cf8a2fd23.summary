@entity0 -- day 1 - wednesday : " now you remember the rules , do n't you ? " cautions my colleague @entity2 , a long time veteran of the prestigious @entity4			1
" what happens in @entity0 , stays in @entity0			1
" " and the @entity11 , " he continues , referring to the notorious late night haunt for the hardcore high - flyers			1
" well , let 's just call that a sort of no - man 's land			2
" and so , armed with my crash course in elite etiquette and clutching a coveted , access - all - areas , white badge , i make my way to the lavish surroundings of the @entity22 -- the epicenter of the @entity27 town 's corporate party scene during " @entity4 week			1
" first stop , @entity29 ' do , where the man himself is on " meet and greet " duty by the door with his children -- reinforcing the importance of family business			2
inside : the very people who make his magazine 's eponymous rich list a must - read			2
after a chance encounter with one of those @entity45 list stalwarts , steel magnate @entity46 , at another @entity49 tycoon @entity48 's party downstairs , it 's off a @entity51 soiree , hosted by insurer @entity52 , where @entity55 - winning trumpeter @entity54 strikes a balanced note as ceo @entity57 works the room			2
before calling it a night , i stop by @entity61 - based events firm @entity62 's do where i have a photograph with @entity65 ceo @entity64 in the corridor			2
on my way in i cross @entity71 -- aka dr @entity71 -- who , judging by the smile on his face , seems remarkably unruffled by the bout of economic optimism at @entity0 this year			1
" i 'm so busy			0
so many meetings , " he flaps before scuttling off to another nightcap and away from the comical @entity27 mountain accordion band about to strike up in their folkloristic costumes			1
day 2 - thursday : two days of sobering talk on inequality , @entity83 and @entity84 certainly have n't sapped the mood			0
if anything , with 40 heads of state and government now gathered in @entity0 , the captains of industry have even more swagger , hobnobbing with the @entity92 of @entity94 politicians			1
after picking the brains of @entity98 's deputy prime minister on @entity100 's security during an ice hockey game he was participating in in the @entity0 arena , it 's time to shed the snow boots and dress to impress			1
at drinks laid on by @entity107 and the @entity108 , i spot former @entity109 and one - time @entity111 spin doctor , @entity112 rubbing shoulders with @entity114 ceo @entity114			0
the latter is smiling broadly , a day before the world learns of his $ 20 million salary for 2013			0
" what 's been your highlight of @entity0 this year ? " i ask another senior banker			1
my mouth falls open when he , in all seriousness , replies " the new @entity125			0
at least we have a decent hotel to stay in with a proper shower			0
" " and the sessions ? " i venture			0
" oh no we never go to any of those , " he chuckles			0
day 3 - friday : @entity98 's @entity132 brings the usual clutch of glamorous girls and moneyed men			2
the band is brilliant even if , as a @entity138 speaker , i ca n't understand a word of what they are singing			0
the champagne flows fast , as if it 's as plentiful as the nation 's oil and gas , while the cloakroom fills up with some of the most ostentatious fur coats i have ever seen			2
@entity149 and his @entity151 wife cut dashing figures as they head towards the bar			0
i deduce the @entity155 foreign secretary must be the most sociable politician present at @entity0 this year for i have run into him at no fewer than five evening events already			1
next , it 's off to @entity160 's bash where @entity162 's @entity161 is mingling among the crowd unaccompanied after his firm 's sudden management reshuffle last week			2
networking doyenne @entity166 is in fine form and -- in the absence of any @entity171 glasses - - is game enough to have her picture taken wearing pair of the joke neon ones handed out			0
having recently collected a $ 1.3 million windfall from the sale of her business , @entity176 has shunned the usual extravagances afforded to most @entity0 millionaires and informs me she 's moving back into the @entity184 bolt hole where her business originally began			1
@entity108 columnist @entity186 and @entity187 of the @entity188 gather for a group photo and everyone bids the bar goodbye			0
day 4 - saturday : @entity0 goes out with a bang as more than a thousand guests gather for a black tie dinner			1
en - route to the venue i 'm lucky enough to share a shuttle with an upbeat @entity197 , the @entity199 chairman of @entity200 , who expresses concern about wage inflation in the market for @entity205 players today			0
@entity207 's fiery @entity0 speech seems to have been the talk of the town among four young @entity199 biotech entrepreneurs i dine with , each of which it turns out has floated their firm on the @entity213 this year while markets enjoy all time records			1
among other notable movers and shakers : the former head of the @entity220 financial services authority @entity221 and @entity224 's @entity223 economics guru @entity222			0
as i ready to leave , i remember no trip to this alpine enclave would be complete without catching @entity1 's own @entity228 editor @entity227 striking up a natty tune at the altogether more inclusive atmosphere of the @entity231 's " @entity11			1
" i 'm just in time , as it turns out , to catch the crowd singing along to @entity235 ' " @entity234			0
" boy , i think , things must have changed since then , before the @entity4 rolled into this pleasant little place			1

@entity1 's @entity247 was at the @entity4 in @entity0 , @entity27
