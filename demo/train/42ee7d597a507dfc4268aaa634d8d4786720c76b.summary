" i 'm getting to the point i wear it with pride , " says @entity3 , a lifelong @entity1 who has warily watched the growth of the illegal immigrant population in the state over the course of her life			1
about 500,000 unauthorized immigrants were believed to live in @entity1 in 2008 , and 11.9 million nationwide , up from 3.5 million nationwide in 1990 , according to a @entity22 report published in 2009			2

it 's how they 're overrunning towns like @entity0 , turning them into " mini-mexicos " with their trash - filled streets and loud music , according to @entity3			1

this comes a day after @entity8 urged its citizens not to travel to @entity1			0
sporting a white baseball cap that that reads , " 100 % american citizen , " @entity3 says she believes that @entity26 came about because law enforcement in @entity0 was fed up over not being able to ask suspects about their immigration status			1

whenever an illegal does something wrong they get a new id and become a new person , " she says			2

@entity140 : share your thoughts on immigration policy @entity144 , a @entity8 - born @entity36 citizen , says she took up the fight against illegal immigration after becoming disillusioned by the attitudes of immigrant families that she witnessed as a teacher in the @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity1			1
" many of these families were having one child after another just to earn a paycheck from the @entity36 government and they did n't care about their children 's education , " says @entity153 , the controversial founder of @entity154 , a grass - roots organization known for its extreme views on immigration enforcement			1

they were hard - working people who wanted to contribute to @entity36 society because it was better than where they came from , " says @entity153 , a petite woman in her 70s			0
" but our government has been giving them handouts for so long that now they expect them			0
