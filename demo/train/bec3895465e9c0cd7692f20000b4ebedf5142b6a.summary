@entity0 -- today 's bipartisan health care meeting is being called a summit , a term that brings to mind diplomatic missions during wartime			1
that 's a fitting description for the atmosphere in @entity9			0
political opponents are considered enemies			0
health care is just the latest example of government dysfunction ; it 's been derailed by hyper - partisanship , over-spending and the disproportionate influence of special interests			1
independent voters , the largest and fastest growing segment of the electorate , hold the balance of power in @entity24 politics , but they have once again been shut out of the debate			1
the professional partisans in @entity9 ignore them at their peril			0
many @entity24 associate broken government with the chaos that followed @entity30 and the anxieties that accompany the current manic recession			1
but the roots of independent voters ' frustration go deeper			1
for them , the first modern evidence of failure from the federal government came during the late 1960s , when the social spending of @entity43 president @entity42 's @entity41 failed to stop urban blight by throwing taxpayer money at the problem			2
one presidency later , the country confronted the corruption of @entity50 from @entity52 president @entity51			0
@entity9 grew more harshly partisan , with political opponents determined to delegitimize any president from day one of his term			0
as the two parties grew more polarized , power shifted from the center to the margins , and special interests increased their influence			1
in reaction , the ranks of independent voters grew from 20 percent of the electorate at the start of the 1960s to 30 percent after @entity50			1
when @entity69 ran for president as an @entity71 in 1992 , the self - made businessman presented himself as a nonideological problem solver			0
his campaign gained traction because both parties had lost credibility as stewards of fiscal responsibility , with overspending and then - record deficits			2
@entity69 briefly led in the polls , and independents spiked to 36 percent of the electorate			2
the divided government of president @entity85 and house speaker @entity86 ultimately produced hard - won budget surpluses			2
but when president @entity89 and the @entity91 - led @entity52 @entity90 ruled @entity9 during the last decade , surpluses again turned to deficits and independents turned against the @entity52			2
independents listed the economy as their no. 1 issue back in 2007 , when @entity43 said health care and @entity52 said terrorism			1
moderates and the middle class -- the people who determine who wins elections -- felt squeezed even before the fiscal crisis , with rising health care and energy costs absorbing whatever benefit they might have received from tax cuts			1
after watching the jet set excess of the @entity111 class from afar , they were left with less and still asked to clean up the mess			0
now , as they try to balance their own budgets at home , they see big government and big business -- @entity9 and @entity119 -- piling up huge debts and passing the buck to the taxpayer			1
it was in this environment that independents began to break with president @entity126 last spring , after voting for him in 2008 by an eight - point margin			1
the change they voted for was rooted in candidate @entity126 's calls for an end to politics that " played to the base " and a restoration of fiscal responsibility			1
the liberal @entity139 leadership 's private negotiations over the $ 787 billion stimulus bill seemed to contradict those promises			0
and the subsequent health care debate was derailed in part because it was seen as adding additional spending and leading to the growth of government			1
in reaction , independents reasserted themselves , their numbers growing quickly and reaching 43 percent by september 2009 , according to a monthly @entity152 / @entity151 poll			2
in @entity157 , @entity154 and @entity156 ' elections , independents voted by at least a 2 - to - 1 margin for @entity52 candidates			2
exit polls showed they were voting to send a message to @entity9 , not necessarily endorsing the @entity163 ' agenda			2
independents ' anger today is focused on familiar targets : hypocritical politicians , over-spending and a lack of agreement on solutions from @entity9			0
independents feel they are paying more and getting less			0
they believe the system has been rigged to benefit special interests at the expense of the national interest			0
as bitter partisanship increases government 's dysfunction , more voters are declaring their independence from politics as usual			1
today 's bipartisan health care summit is a step in the right direction			1
independent voters want to see the warring parties in @entity9 speaking to each other in the presence of television cameras , ensuring at least a degree of civility and accountability			1
it 's more difficult to demonize the opposition when talking with them			0
but photo - op centrism is , of course , not enough			0
it must be followed by substance			0
to really change the culture of @entity9 , we need to change the rules that reinforce this predictable partisanship			0
the quickest policy cure would be to change the rigged system of redistricting that creates congressional ' safe seats ' and replaces competitive general elections with closed primaries , where party activists reign supreme			0
nonpartisan redistricting and open primaries would reward politicians who reach across the aisle , and would empower independent voters			1
@entity24 ' sense that government is broken did n't happen overnight , and it wo n't be solved overnight			1
it will take time to restore trust in @entity9			0
but substantive efforts to depolarize our politics will lead to the politics of problem solving			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity228 says health care summit comes amid a period of bipartisan dysfunction in government
*historically* , frustrated independent voters increase in this *climate* , hold balance of power , he says
let down by bipartisan *gridlock* , *stalled* agenda , *faltering* economy , independents have broken with @entity126
@entity228 : health care meeting is chance for parties to show independents they can change
