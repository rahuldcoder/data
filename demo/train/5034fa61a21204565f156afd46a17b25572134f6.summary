-- in the empty towns surrounding the ravaged @entity5 power plant , piles of radioactive dirt serve as monuments to the difficulty of cleaning up the worst nuclear accident since @entity9			1
while the physics and engineering that go into a nuclear power plant may be sophisticated , undoing the damage left behind by the @entity5 meltdowns is largely a brute - force affair that relies on shovels , fire hoses and bulldozers			1
" it 's pretty simple stuff , at least early in the process , " said @entity19 , an @entity20 professor who studies the effect of radiation on the environment			0
" they seem very low - tech , but low - tech works reasonably well			1
" sunday , @entity29 marks a year since the historic earthquake that killed nearly 16,000 people in the country 's northeast			1
the tsunami generated by the quake flooded the @entity5 plant , triggering meltdowns in its three operating reactors			1
while no deaths have been attributed to the nuclear disaster , more than 100,000 people remain displaced from the towns where its long - lived fallout settled			1
unlike @entity9 , where the @entity46 abandoned a 30 - kilometer ( 19 - mile ) radius around the plant following that 1986 disaster , @entity29 's government says it will reclaim the stricken area			1
prime minister @entity50 says more than 1 trillion yen ( $ 12 billion ) has been budgeted for the reclamation effort , and they hope to begin allowing some of the residents to return home by april			1
nearly 60 % of that money has already been committed , including $ 3.4 billion to compensate affected residents			1
but the decontamination effort is expected to take another two years , and what it can do to make the worst - hit towns habitable again remains to be seen , @entity50 spokesman @entity57 told @entity0			1
" we are putting our priority to the areas where we have a realistic prospect of having residents return , " @entity57 said			1
ultimately , @entity29 has set a goal for cleaning up all areas where radiation levels are 1 millisievert over normal background , based on an estimate of eight hours a day spent outdoors			1
that 's 104 towns , some in which work has already begun			1
the government expects to have more than 30,000 people involved in the cleanup effort by april			1
the work so far focuses on areas where annual doses of radiation are between 20 and 50 millisieverts a year -- seven to 16 times the typical amount a resident of an industrialized country receives in a year , but below the threshold for an increased risk of cancer			1
most of those are outside the 20 - kilometer exclusion zone drawn around the plant in the early days of the disaster			1
monitoring posts in the towns closest to the plant , such as @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , report radiation levels many times higher			2
at some points , annual radiation doses run five to 10 times what 's allowed for nuclear plant workers			0
for residents of those towns , which were battered by the earthquake before the meltdowns occurred , the frustration levels remain elevated as well			2
" i have to accept this because an earthquake and tsunami are natural disasters , " @entity95 town councilman @entity108 said			0
" but a nuclear accident is a man - made disaster			2
the government decides the policy and the operator caused this accident			0
" places like @entity95 remain largely frozen in time a year after the disaster , untouched by the rebuilding boom seen in other parts of @entity29			1
the stillness is broken only by the occasional foray by people like @entity108 , who are periodically allowed back in to check on their properties , and by animals such as dogs and cattle that now roam freely around the former farm towns			2
@entity57 said the government is still studying how to clean up areas where the annual dose tops 50 millisieverts , the standard international limit for nuclear industry workers -- " a difficult area to realize returns , " he said			2
the bulk of the reclamation effort so far involves scraping away the top 2 inches of soil in the contaminated areas , with particular focus on clearing grounds of public facilities like hospitals and schools			2
@entity19 and her colleagues have been studying how contaminants spread through the soil and get absorbed into plants -- a major concern in the largely agricultural area around the plant			2
studies conducted since @entity9 have shown that the ammonium nitrate in common fertilizer or the addition of potassium slows that process , while natural processes drive radioactive particles into the ground , she said			2
vacuuming , sandblasting , painting and stripping surfaces and hosing down roads and walls are " consistently effective " decontamination techniques in urbanized areas , a 2007 review by the @entity173 government 's @entity171 found			2
but @entity174 , a radiation expert with the anti-nuclear environmental group @entity176 , said the government in @entity178 has made a mistake by concentrating on the abandoned towns around the plant			0
" they created expectations with population that was evacuated that they would be able to return in a reasonable time , " @entity174 said			0
" now it 's become more and more clear , and is very frustrating to those people , that they will not be able to return soon or may never be able to return at all			0
" meanwhile , he said , local authorities are struggling to clean up " hot spots " in still - inhabited areas like the city of @entity5 , well outside the exclusion zone			1
" we see that some parts have been decontaminated -- for instance , the soil has been removed and new soil has been put down , " he said			0
" in those areas , radiation levels have dropped			0
but on the concrete and asphalt , it is a very sticky problem			0
" @entity57 said the government is responding to the demands of its people who wish to go home			0
" we wish to respect their intentions , their wish to go back to their homes , " he said			0
" of course , as i explained to you , we are carrying out massive decontamination efforts			0
i do n't really get the point that you can disregard the wish and will of those residents			0
" but @entity57 said the government is still trying to figure out where to put the contaminated soil and debris that has piled up during the effort			0
an october report by the @entity227 estimated that material could be as much as 29 million cubic meters , roughly enough to fill the landmark @entity230 two dozen times			0
and even when annual radiation levels can be cut below the 20 millisieverts the government says is safe -- itself a measure that has been the subject of debate -- former residents may be reluctant to come home			0
" it 's a little bit of a chicken and an egg , " @entity19 said			0
" people do n't want to be the pioneers , if you will , to go in where there 's no supporting infrastructure			0
so if you 're a family and you 're told the place is clean , but there 's no school open , are you going to move your family back into that area ? how are you going to encourage them to come back so that you really do have a functioning town again ? " @entity0 's @entity254 in @entity178 and @entity255 in @entity95 , @entity29 , contributed to this report .			2

decontaminating towns around @entity5 is a largely low - tech affair
the work has focused on areas with a " realistic prospect " of people returning
@entity29 has *pledged* about $ 12 billion to the effort over the next two years
radioactive " hot spots " linger beyond the exclusion zone
