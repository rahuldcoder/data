a petty crime sealed a final decision to retire to the @entity3 island of @entity4 -- but it could be legitimate government action to rescue @entity3 from economic melt - down that eventually forces @entity6 and @entity7 back to the @entity8			1
lured by the @entity11 diet and climate , the couple moved to the village of @entity14 in western @entity4 from @entity15 in 1997			2
the burglary at their @entity8 home was enough to seek a permanent move to a country known for its friendly welcome			0
" there was no crime here in those days ... and it 's still the case , " said @entity6 who recounted the story of leaving a camera in a taverna and returning the next day to find it still hanging on the back of the chair where it was left			0
initially they rented but seven years ago they bought a plot of land , built their own home , learned @entity3 and settled			1
the couple still love the people and the country they have adopted but @entity6 paints a picture of a nation in a mess -- one where strikes are commonplace , officialdom is mistrusted and illegal payments and tax evasion are part of everyday life			1
however , the medicine needed to fix it could force out those who have retired to a country which is imposing higher taxation to rid itself of a chronic debt problem			1
according to @entity56 , @entity3 owed more than 140 % of its annual gdp in 2010 , and the country is currently reliant on a huge bailout			2
the @entity59 says @entity3 's projected debt for 2011 stands at nearly € 353 billion ( $ 487 billion )			1
@entity6 and @entity7 say they are facing an extra property tax of € 500 ( $ 690 ) next year and for the moment they say they can manage , but accountants are already sending letters to their clients warning that there may be more taxes on the way			1
another @entity8 couple , @entity72 and @entity73 , who have also settled in @entity4 , say future tax increases may hit some ex-pats quite hard , particularly those on pensions			2
" luckily we have n't got a swimming pool or big house or big car which are being targeted to raise extra cash , " said @entity72			1
as well as extra taxes , the @entity3 government is working hard to stamp out tax evasion and reform public pensions			1
according to the @entity3 finance ministry 's figures , last year it seized 555 yachts and imposed fines of € 3.4 billion ( $ 4.7 billion )			1
but @entity92 says he continues to see regular evasion , explaining that shops may charge € 25 ( $ 35 ) for a purchase but give a receipt for € 15 ( $ 21 ) or no receipt at all			2
and he says many workers will ask for a small cash bribe to carry out a favour			0
" graft is a way of life , " said @entity6			0
" people are looking for it			0
we 've got used to it but we do n't pay backhanders to people if they ask			0
" despite the frustrations , the couple are sympathetic to the plight of the @entity3 people and understand their anger			1
" the current situation is driving most people to distraction because they realize the things being imposed on them are punitive -- absolutely nothing is being done to promote growth , " said @entity6			0
" they see people at the top getting away with what they perceive as blue murder			0
" there are so many good things about this place			0
the people are very nice , friendly , helpful and generous when they know you			0
we really enjoy it here and we would n't want to go back to the @entity8 unless we were forced to			0
" however , the couple believe an increased tax burden on their @entity8 pension , which is their only income , could make it a possibility			2
the prospects for @entity3 are not promising			2
it has teetered on the edge of defaulting on its debts and the population is resentful of the austerity measures introduced so far			1
there are frequent protests and a public sector strike last week brought the country to a standstill			0
and there are other problems			0
according to @entity6 , local hotels have pegged their room prices for three years , but he said taxi driver strikes leave tourists stranded at the airport , and extra taxes could further discourage visitors and drive away those who have already moved to @entity3 and spend their money there .			1
