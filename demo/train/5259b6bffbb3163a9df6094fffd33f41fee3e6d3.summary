@entity1 , who has never reached the final at @entity5 , triumphed 6 - 1 5 - 7 5 - 7 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 ) 6 - 1 against the fifth seed in a scintillating match lasting just over four hours			1
the 25 - year - old set up a rematch with 16 - time grand slam champion @entity19 , who beat @entity1 in the @entity21 semifinals last year to end his 43 - match winning run			1
" he was the better player for most of the match and i was fortunate to come back from four match - points down			1
it was an incredible match , " said @entity1 , who won the first and fifth sets in a combined time of just 53 minutes			2
the hopes of a nation had rested on @entity11 , playing in the quarterfinals of his home event for the first time , but @entity37 's wait for a first male champion since @entity39 in 1983 must continue			1
instead , @entity1 will have a day 's rest before continuing his bid to match @entity43 's @entity42 , who twice won all four grand slams in a calendar year -- as an amateur in 1962 and then as a professional at the start of the @entity5 era in 1969			1
" i did what i said i would and gave everything			0
i came close and i would have loved to have won , " said @entity11 , who had vowed before the match to " fight like a lion			0
" " it 's a shame because i was pretty close , but at the end i had no energy left			0
now i will have to close this chapter , " the 27 - year - old added			0
@entity19 reached the last four at a major for a record - equaling 31st time as he came from two sets down to end the hopes of injury - hampered @entity63			2
the @entity65 third seed won 3 - 6 6 - 7 ( 4 - 7 ) 6 - 2 6 - 0 6 - 3 in a virtual repeat of their 2009 semifinal , when @entity19 went on to claim the @entity5 crown for the first and only time in his illustrious career			2
@entity63 avenged that defeat by beating @entity19 in the 2009 @entity73 final for his only major success , but this time the @entity76 ninth seed could not maintain his ferocious opening momentum			0
" i knew @entity63 's knee was bothering him and was trying to finish the rallies quickly , " @entity19 said			0
" i knew it would be a big fight today			0
" the other two quarterfinals will be played on wednesday , when world no. 2 @entity83 continues his bid for a record seventh title as he takes on fellow @entity88 @entity87 , the 12th seed			0
