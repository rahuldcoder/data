-- for more than half a year , super pacs and other third - party advertisers have aired misleading attacks against @entity6 @entity5 incumbent sen. @entity4 and his probable @entity8 opponent , professor @entity7			1
( you can see a sample of these ads at @entity12			0
by calling on these groups to stay out of their contest , @entity4 and @entity13 are attempting to do something about " air pollution " in their state			2
there 's a way that @entity5 viewers and tv and radio stations in the state can help them achieve that goal			1
the same option is available in the presidential contest , in which the leading @entity6 presidential contenders have called repeatedly on their third - party champions and challengers to forgo deception			0
like those of @entity13 and @entity4 , their complaints are justified			0
in @entity41 and in @entity42 , the @entity38 super pac that calls itself " restoring our future " wrongly accused former house speaker @entity43 of supporting legislation facilitating abortion in @entity46 and of being " fined " $ 300,000 for ethics violations when instead he was required to reimburse the costs of the investigation			1
the same pseudonymous group also invited the false conclusion that former sen. @entity53 had voted to restore voting rights to felons who were still serving time			0
to this mix , in @entity41 the @entity56 that styled itself " making a @entity70 " added a funny but flawed ad that showed " @entity61 " shredding the names of companies that had met their demise under ( here 's the misleading part ) someone else 's watch			0
@entity72 's history at @entity73 elicited another third - party volley in @entity42 in the form of an @entity77 ' ( @entity77 ) ad that wrongly attempted to enmesh the former governor in @entity81 fraud at a @entity73 - owned company			0
not to be outdone , the @entity99 cloaked in the name " @entity98 " has trafficked out the false allegation that @entity72 's health reform in @entity5 is " government - run health care " ( a claim repeatedly debunked by fact - checkers ) that " sent costs spiraling out of control , hiking premiums , squeezing household budgets " when , instead , as @entity97 noted , " cost increases for individual households are largely due to the fact that health care costs have been rising across the country			2
" while recent court decisions ensure that uprooting super @entity102 from the political landscape is a fool 's errand , making their deceptive televised claims vanish is easier			2
the reason ? where , with some exceptions , tv and radio stations are required to air ( and are barred from censoring ) federal candidates ' ads , no such requirements govern the messages of outside groups			1
and , significantly , stations have the right to insist on the accuracy of the " independent expenditure " ads they accept			1
so the answer to " air pollution " by super pacs is simple : television and radio stations should just say no to misleading third - party ads. to increase their incentive to do so in a world where ad revenue bolsters the bottom line , viewers might want to tweet or blog ( or send something once known as a letter ) applauding responsible station action or decrying business as usual			2
to find out which @entity42 tv stations have aired ads flagged by the major fact checking organizations , go to @entity12			1
join the conversation on @entity145 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			0

candidates for @entity151 in @entity5 are seeking to *prevent* deceptive super pac ads
@entity148 : such ads could be stopped *nationwide* if tv stations *refused* to air them
she says stations are required to air candidates ' ads , but not those of independent groups
@entity148 : ads that *distort* candidates ' records should *n't* be given air time
