-- a @entity2 man pleaded guilty thursday to murdering four relatives on @entity4 in 2009 , avoiding a possible death sentence after reaching a plea deal with prosecutors			1
after hearing from relatives of the victims , @entity9 circuit judge @entity8 sentenced @entity13 to seven life terms			1
as part of the agreement , the defendant agreed to waive any rights of appeal			1
" you 'll never see the light of day , " @entity8 told the 37 - year - old @entity13 on thursday , in front of a packed @entity22 courtroom			2
having shaved his head and tried to disguise his 2007 blue @entity26 with a car cover and switching its license plate , @entity13 was arrested in january 2010 at a @entity30 motel after an " @entity32 " viewer recognized him			2
he was on a computer when @entity35 marshals burst into his second - floor room at the @entity37 , where he had checked in under the name @entity40 , according to authorities			0
@entity13 was then charged with four counts of premeditated murder and three counts attempted first - degree murder in the @entity4 night shooting deaths of his twin sisters , a 6 - year - old cousin and a 79 - year - old aunt at a family home in @entity52 , @entity2			1
one of the victims -- @entity54 , 33 , who was one of @entity13 's sisters -- was pregnant			2
her husband , @entity57 , was one of two other family members who survived after being wounded in the shooting rampage , authorities said			1
family members suggested in interviewers that @entity13 " had ongoing resentment " for some of his relatives , @entity52 @entity61 spokeswoman @entity60 said shortly after the shootings			1
@entity69 , who was shot in the stomach , was among the family members who told the judge thursday that he approved the plea deal			1
he explained that he wanted to " pick up the pieces " and did not want to endure " 20 years " of appeals			0
but @entity76 , whose 6 - year - old daughter , @entity77 , was among those gunned down , objected to the agreement as he wanted @entity13 to go on trial and potentially face the death penalty			1
he urged the judge to delay the sentencing so he could " prepare a proper presentation " with an attorney to detail his argument			0
near the end of his statement thursday , the judge sternly told @entity76 -- then carrying a large picture of his daughter -- to " stop ! " after he knelt down			0
" this plea decision is far too important to rush through without any time for us , for all of us , to think , " said @entity76 , accusing the state of trying to push the deal through			0
" we 've been waiting patiently for almost two years for this case to come to trial			0
... justice is what is at stake here			0
" the start of @entity13 's trial had been set for january			0
his public defenders had filed court documents expressing their intent to defend him using an insanity defense			0
after thursday 's court proceeding , state attorney @entity107 released a statement in which he said that -- " after careful evaluation and consideration " -- he decided to accept @entity13 's plea , having determined it is " an appropriate resolution to the case			2
" noting the disparate opinions among the victims ' family members and about the death penalty generally , @entity107 said he felt it sufficient that @entity13 " will have no hope of having favorable rulings by a court " and " will have no ability to affect ... the lives of those he harmed			1
" " i believe that seven consecutive life sentences recognize the heinous nature of the crimes and adequately punish the defendant , " he said .			0
