-- rowing across the @entity1 may be an extreme test of human endurance but an all female crew who completed the feat discovered a secret tactic to ease the physical burden -- rowing nude			1
" we spent a lot of time rowing naked because when the sea water gets inside your clothes it increases friction against your skin which can cause sores , " says @entity8 , @entity10 team			1
" if you row naked it means you do n't rub as much and you also get dry much quicker instead of constantly having wet clothes , " she adds			1
the unconventional ploy worked to perfection as @entity8 and her fellow crew members -- @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 -- smashed the existing @entity1 crossing record for a boat of five rowers , taking just 45 days			1
the @entity36 team also became the first all female boat to complete the 2,600 mile voyage between the @entity39 and @entity40 , although they were sure to don clothing as they approached their final destination last month			1

" it was something we worked hard for and were really determined to achieve when we set out			0
" the trip followed a route previously used to transport slaves between @entity54 and the @entity55 in the 19th century , raising money for @entity36 - based anti-human trafficking charities the @entity59 and @entity58			1
@entity8 , whose day job is a youth worker at @entity58 , says the motivation to achieve something notable for such a worthy cause far outweighed any inhibitions that she or the crew may have held			0
" we got to know each other very well , " says @entity8 as she recalls airing her sores in front of her ship mates after a particularly hard day of rowing			2
" what 's been most inspiring since we got back however is that some of the young people that i work with have told me they 've been inspired by us to take up a 10 kilometer run which is really quite sweet , " she says			0
as well as having to improvise to counter boils and sores , @entity8 and her crew faced numerous other unexpected challenges during the course of their epic voyage			1
she highlights the steering on the boat breaking and losing much of their food when hatches became flooded with sea water as two of the most daunting issues to arise			2
" our water maker , which made most of our water , also broke but in the end we were brought closer together by everything that happened			2
we even used to sing to each other to keep our spirits up , " says @entity8			0
" by the end we were quite dehydrated , " she adds			0
" but it was a great feeling when we realized what we had achieved			0
" see also : round the world rowing and cycle challenge @entity8 and her crew mates have since returned to their day jobs but are already busy plotting their next mission			0
" because of our focus on human trafficking we are considering traveling across some of the deserts in @entity110 which are major trafficking routes , " she says			0
but no matter what the crew end up doing next @entity8 thinks it likely and preferable that the task will be completed fully dressed			0
" it was a necessity at the time but our next mission will definitely be with clothes on , " she says .			1
