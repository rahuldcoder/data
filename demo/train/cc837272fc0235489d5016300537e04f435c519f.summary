-- when @entity3 director @entity2 accepted his @entity4 for best foreign film last month , he spoke a few words of thanks , paused and announced he wanted to say something about his people			1
two nations held their breath			1
" they are a peace - loving people , " @entity2 said , and then was gone			2
brief though it was , his comment was eloquent , to the point and unsettling in its simplicity			2
much of the reason that " @entity30 " has made such an impact in the @entity21 -- a virtual sweep of the critics ' prizes , a @entity4 and two @entity26 nominations , including a virtually unheard of nod for a non- @entity29 screenplay -- is that it is n't a foreign film at all ( except for all that @entity33 )			1
if anything , it 's a feel - good movie , albeit in a wildly perverse way : having experienced the anguish of @entity2 's characters , the viewer comes away with the inescapable sense of our common humanity , the resounding sense that we 're all in this life together			1
if that sounds @entity46 © d , so be it			2
this is not a politically acceptable position , of course			0
amid the glib militarism of @entity58 presidential candidates , the bellicosity of @entity3 president @entity53 and the nuclear recklessness of the mullahs , " @entity30 " drives home the oft - ignored fact that @entity3 is full of educated , sophisticated and cultured people who do n't necessarily agree with their government either			1
particularly the lead characters of " a separation			0
" @entity2 does n't ask for trouble			0
no one in the cast declares that , " our impossible , infuriatingly theocratic regime is anti-intellectual , anti-opportunity , anti-woman , anti-freedom , anti-human			2
" nevertheless , @entity71 ( @entity72 ) wants out			0
a young mother of @entity75 's educated middle - class , she wants a better life for her daughter , @entity77 ( played by the director 's daughter , @entity78 ) and -- why not ? -- a better life for herself			1
she works , she takes classes , she harbors an intellectual curiosity			0
under her hijab , her hair is dyed an unnatural but quite chic shade of red , which more or less reflects her disposition			0
she 's going , whether her husband , @entity88 , is willing or not			0
his father is suffering from dementia and ca n't be left behind			0
and , as @entity92 law demands that the husband decides where the daughter goes , @entity77 is staying , too			0
without giving away the whole plot , it 's worth saying that " @entity30 " snowballs into a demi - tragedy propelled by institutional hubris : @entity71 is judged by the system to have insufficient grounds for divorce , but what can happen otherwise when the grounds for her request are the very system that is denying her the divorce ? @entity88 , needing to find a housekeeper who can care for his father while he goes to work , rashly hires @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , a woman so fearful of religious impropriety that she has to call for a ruling before she can change the incontinent old man out of his soggy clothes			1
that she can not touch @entity88 's father , played by @entity117 , lest she violate some religious tenet , verges on the absurdly comedic			0
the series of misunderstandings and various acts of dishonesty that intertwine so gracefully and with such a dreadful sense of destiny , are all predicated on a system that denies reality			2
as such , it can find a mirror in an @entity29 political system in which politicians are willing to mouth any absurdity to appeal to a noisy , marginalized and in many cases fundamentalist minority , whose inclinations toward freedom , intellect , diversity and reason do n't place them all that far from the mullahs			1
frankly , you do n't want either group to have a nuke			0
but that makes " @entity30 " something of a dangerous movie , at least among those for whom division among peoples spells political profit			1
at a time of nationalism - cum - tribalism , and a seemingly sweaty eagerness for the @entity29 and @entity3 to mix it up militarily , @entity2 's camera cultivates emotional generosity : the point of view swings from objective to subjective , capturing the emotions of the characters via their shared point of view			1
the perspective swings from @entity71 to @entity77 to @entity110 to @entity88 , the upshot being a marriage of perception , a unity of view , a sharing of experience not only among the characters , but the audience			0
it all adds up to an experience that is rare at the movies , directorially demanding and which creates the very phenomenon that makes " @entity30 " unique and resonant			1
you may walk out of the theater , but you ca n't walk out of the movie			0
because its story is all around us			2
