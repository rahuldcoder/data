-- even by the standards of supercars , and nearly a decade after it was first introduced , the @entity1 is something remarkable			1
that much is clear from the moment you climb into it , and find yourself in a cockpit trimmed with carbonfibre , the high - tech material that @entity12 cars are built from			0
the gt 's chassis and bodywork are made from the same material			2
parts of the cabin bear a close resemblance to other modern porsches -- the instruments and steering wheel are almost the same as those of the 911 and @entity25 -- but all similarities end once you fire up the @entity1 's engine			1
the 5.7 - litre @entity30 motor sits behind you , and bursts into life with a busy , purposeful noise , responding instantly to any pressure on the throttle pedal			0
it sounds like a race car engine -- indeed , it pretty much is , having originally been created for a @entity38 program that @entity1 subsequently cancelled			1
and the best part of a decade after it went on sale , the @entity1 's mighty 605bhp power output still makes it one of the most powerful road cars ever constructed			1
moving off is the first big challenge			0
the @entity1 was only produced with a manual gearbox , and the engine 's instant responses and a race - specification ceramic clutch mean you have to be gentle to avoid stalling			1
opinion : why race car drivers crave speed yet as soon as the @entity1 is moving , it starts to feel far more normal			1
it might have been hyped as a road - going racer , but i found it as easy to drive as any other @entity1			1
that mighty engine is happy to trundle along at low revs and , once you 've got used to the clutch , the gearshift is light and accurate			0
the gt is wider than most cars , and its firm suspension means you have to tackle poor quality roads slowly			0
if i had the money to afford one , i would definitely drive it every day			0
start to go faster and the @entity1 shows a far harder edge to its personality			1
as a supercar , it 's been designed to go fast -- and its limits are toweringly high			0
so high that , to get consistently close to them , you 'd need both a racetrack and time to learn the car 's habits properly			1
the engine loves to rev , and working it as hard as it encourages you to unleashes neck - straining acceleration that 's pretty much outside the frame of reference			0
@entity1 claims the @entity1 can blast from 0 - 60mph in 3.5 seconds , and from 0 - 100mph in just 6.9 seconds			2
those numbers reflect the car 's ability to shrink even the longest straights			2
fortunately , its carbon - ceramic brakes are as good at scrubbing off speed as the engine is at adding it			0
astonishing though its straight - line pace is , it 's in the corners that the gt really comes alive			0
like all porsches , it 's easy to drive quickly thanks to accurate steering and a keenness to both change direction and to stick closely to a chosen line			0
the vast tyres offer huge grip : you can drive the @entity1 quicker than pretty much anything else without ever finding its limits			2
and within just a few laps on track it 's possible to be pushing the car hard , reveling in the g - forces it can develop and the feedback it offers			2
like most modern cars , it has a traction control system as standard -- which works to match the power that gets sent to the rear wheels to the amount of grip available and preventing the back of the car from sliding under power			2
most drivers will be able to drive the @entity1 considerably quicker if they leave the system on , but turning it off does reveal another side to the car 's character -- with what can be a sudden transition from the car gripping to sliding			1
for some , that 's part of the @entity1 's appeal as a supercar , of course -- but you 've got to be extremely confident in your own abilities to consider switching the system off			1
and while some parts of the media seem determined to portray the @entity1 as flawed or inherently dangerous , it 's categorically not			1
while it 's inevitable that questions will be asked in light of this week 's tragic events , we need to wait until we have all the facts before reaching conclusions			0
but the truth is that any car offering this extreme level of performance has to be treated with a corresponding degree of respect			1
even experienced drivers like @entity154 , father of @entity156 racer @entity155 , have crashed @entity157 , and @entity159 presenter @entity158 has described it as having a " savagery that 's hard to explain			0
" the higher the limits are , the bigger the risks when you overstep them , so if you do lose control , you 're likely to be traveling at mind - blowing speeds			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			2

@entity174 's death probe is focusing on speed of the @entity1
@entity1 's power makes it a powerful road car , writes @entity171
some media portray @entity1 as inherently dangerous , it 's not , he says
he writes : any car with this level of performance must be treated with respect
