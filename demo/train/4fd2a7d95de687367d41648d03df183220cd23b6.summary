@entity0 -- @entity2 left @entity3 for the @entity4 more than 30 years ago , but last year was the first time she 'd been counted as part of the @entity7			1
@entity8 was among thousands of illegal immigrants in @entity0 who filled out a census form last year , and city officials said the response , especially among @entity14 , might have saved the area money and congressional representation			1
the increased count was purposeful : a @entity19 outreach program urged undocumented workers to fill out the census and assured them that nothing on the form could be used against them			1
the program included @entity26 call centers that would field questions about the census , plus billboards , bus advertisements and fliers with information			1
celebrities publicized the census , too			2
the response : the 2010 census showed that the numbers of @entity14 living in this country increased by 43 % , from 35 million to more than 50 million , during the past 10 years			1
@entity39 , executive director of the @entity40 , testified before a @entity42 subcommittee this month that @entity44 participation in the census was " unprecedented			2
" but in some areas , poor communication , hostility toward @entity14 and immigrants and a cultural fear of the government prevented a complete count , he said			2
in @entity8 's case , her daughter encouraged her to fill out the form			2
" it 's important to count me , " @entity8 said in broken @entity57 , " because i 'm important			0
i live in this country			0
" mayor @entity60 was thrilled by @entity0 ' mail participation rate			1
at more than 70 % , he said , it was among the highest for large cities and close to the national mail participation rate of 74 %			0
more important , it might have secured money and political clout for the area			0
the @entity19 uses population counts to apportion seats in the @entity71 , and the federal government uses decennial census data to distribute more than $ 400 billion a year			2
" the last time around , 10 years ago , we were the second - worst among big cities in the country in terms of the undercount , " @entity60 said			0
the 2000 undercount cost @entity0 more than $ 200 million in federal funds			1
@entity60 believes the outreach to the @entity44 and immigrant communities and the homeless population account for @entity0 ' 2010 response success			1
the @entity40 said each person in the @entity4 , legal or not , is worth about $ 1,400 in federal funds to a community per year			1
cities use these federal dollars to help pay for police and fire protection , along with vital infrastructure and other services			0
it is illegal , however , to use federal dollars to aid illegal immigrants directly , and they can not receive government assistance			1
instead , religious and other organizations fill the void			2
at the @entity102 in the @entity44 - heavy @entity0 suburb of @entity104 , the size of the @entity44 population was clear well before it was counted by the census			1
sister @entity106 said the center relies solely on donations ; if she accepted government funding , she 'd be required to ask those seeking help from the center to prove their residency status			0
" it 's a ministry to the poor , " said @entity106 , who runs the center along with the @entity116			0
" we serve anyone who comes and asks for food			0
we do not ask for papers			0
we do not ask any proof			0
" share your story through @entity127 's @entity126 the count is about more than money and resources , though			0
@entity60 said @entity131 would have lost a congressional seat if this census count remained at or near the same as in 2000			1
that seat was saved , he said , because more people were counted			1
" what this does is , at a minimum , it allows @entity131 and other states with large immigrant populations to get the representation they deserve , " @entity60 said			2
but knowing that illegal immigrants might help to maintain the political power for a city or district raises the ire of some anti-immigration groups			1
" you have an imbalance , " said @entity150 , founder of @entity151			0
" you might have a congressional district in @entity0 of 600,000 people but only 100,000 citizens			1
so those citizens have five times the voting power of someone in @entity160			0
you 'll have politicians who say ' i want these people counted			0
i get more power , but i can manipulate the situation because they ca n't vote			0

census : latinos living in @entity4 increased by 43 *percent* , from 35 million to 50 million
an outreach program in @entity172 urged illegal immigrants to fill out census
@entity0 mayor said the increase in responses saved a congressional seat for @entity131
