-- i recently became the proud owner of a bobblehead moose magnet			2
the jaunty little guy sports a @entity6 t - shirt , and while made in @entity7 , he reminds me of a lovely @entity9 adventure lacking only in a real moose			2
@entity11 knows all about the draw of those touristy retail emporiums packed to the ceilings with tacky t - shirts and plastic bric - a - brac			2
he 's the author of " @entity17 : the @entity18			1
" the book , released this month , features more than 150 tchotchke photos , some of which @entity11 collected from travelers online			1
he 's still collecting photos of these gems on his website crapsouvenirs.com			1
@entity0 asked @entity11 to explain his terminology			2
he provided the following answers via e-mail : what 's a " crap souvenir ? " for starters , i want to be clear that " crap souvenir " is just a snarky way to say " awesomely kitsch			1
" these are a collection of entertaining souvenirs that are , you might say , so bad , they 're good			0
it was hard to find a litmus test for tacky -- nearly all souvenirs possess an element of tackiness			0
( finding kitsch - free souvenirs is a far more difficult task			0
) in the end , it was a gut reaction			0
i suppose i was looking for something that invoked an emotion that landed somewhere between a cringe and a laugh			0
is the photo better than the vacation ? what criteria did you consider for an " awesomely kitsch " or remarkably crappy souvenir ? it was almost more difficult to define what was a souvenir			1
sure , it 's @entity62 for " to remember , " but that does n't help the selection process much			1
your first thought , like mine , might be that a souvenir is a memento you bring back from a trip			1
seems reasonable , but consider the example of a @entity73 tourist who picks up an @entity74 while visiting @entity76 's @entity75			1
he might consider it a souvenir of his visit			1
and his device is a souvenir for him , but @entity74 in general are n't			1
so , @entity84 is that it has to be a souvenir on its own standing			2
rule 2 : it should be an object on sale to the public			0
there may be a life - size polar bear in a cowboy hat and hula skirt standing in front of a tourist shop that makes for memorable souvenir photos , and one could argue that any item is for sale if you make the right offer , but if it is n't specifically there to be sold , it does n't count			1
travel snapshots : not - so - kitsch souvenirs rule 3 is a bit more complicated			0
it should be tied to a location			0
one way is simply to print the name of the town , city or country on it			0
but that would also qualify any random object that says " made in @entity7			0
" so it has to be tied to a place in a way more substantial than being outsourced for production			2
in lieu of a printed location , the item might include national colors or depictions of a famous icon or be made of well - known items endemic to that locale			0
this was my working guideline			0
however , after all this reasoning , there were a few exceptions that were simply too deliciously kitsch to pass up			0
what 's the tackiest souvenir you 've ever come home with ? share your finds in the comments section below .			1
