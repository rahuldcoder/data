-- in the wake of a multi-million - dollar online scam , more than 300,000 computer users worldwide could find themselves without web access this summer			1
luckily for them , it will only take a few clicks to clean things up			0
the @entity9 announced that it 's created a website where users can check whether they 're infected with malware and remove it if they are			1
check your computer here -- http://www.dcwg.org			0
the site was at times difficult to access on monday , presumably due to heavy traffic			2
let us explain : in november , six @entity21 nationals were arrested on charges of fraud after a two - year @entity9 probe called @entity25			2
they 're accused of infecting computers worldwide with malware called @entity28 , which opened up the computers to viruses			2
the alleged crooks used the access to direct users to their own servers and manipulate online advertising , racking up more than $ 14 million in illegal income , according to the @entity9			1

if it had merely shut down the rogue servers , many of those infected would n't have been able to access the @entity67 at all , the @entity9 said			1
most infected users on the @entity9 servers may not have noticed anything different , although the malware itself may have made their web access slower and disabled their anti-virus software			1

by visiting the website set up by the @entity9 , users can click to see if their computer is infected			1
an image with a green background appears if they 're ok , while a red one shows up if they 're not			0
if infected , they 're then directed to information on how to remove the malware			2
