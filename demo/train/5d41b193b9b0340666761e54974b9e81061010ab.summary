-- a judge on monday ordered a @entity3 woman to decrypt her laptop computer so prosecutors can use the files against her in a criminal case			1
the defendant , accused of bank fraud , had unsuccessfully argued that being forced to do so violates the @entity11 's protection against compelled self - incrimination			1
" i conclude that the @entity11 is not implicated by requiring production of the unencrypted contents of the @entity19 laptop computer , " @entity3 @entity14 district judge @entity13 ruled monday (			1
the authorities seized the laptop from defendant @entity22 in 2010 with a court warrant while investigating financial fraud			0
the case is being closely watched (			0

full disk encryption is an option built into the latest flavors of @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , and well - designed encryption protocols used with a long passphrase can take decades to break , even with massive computing power			0
the government had argued that there was no @entity11 breach , and that it might " require significant resources and may harm the subject computer " if the authorities tried to crack the encryption			2
assistant u.s. attorney @entity47 said in a court filing (			0

" a factually similar dispute involving child pornography ended with a @entity72 federal judge ordering the defendant to decrypt the hard drive of his laptop			1
while that case never reached the @entity30 , it differed from the @entity22 matter because @entity14 border agents already knew there was child porn on the computer because they saw it while the computer was running during a 2006 routine stop along the @entity87 border			2
the judge in the @entity3 case said there was plenty of evidence â € ” a jailhouse recording of the defendant â € ” that the laptop might contain information the authorities were seeking			1
the judge ordered @entity22 to surrender an unencrypted hard drive by february 21			2
the judge added that the government is precluded " from using ms. @entity22 's act of production of the unencrypted hard drive against her in any prosecution			0
