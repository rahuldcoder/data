@entity0 -- a new classified directive to coalition forces in @entity4 puts restrictions on nighttime raids of @entity4 homes and compounds , according to a senior @entity10 official who has seen the document			1
the official declined to be identified because a declassified version of the document has not been made public			0
the directive is signed by gen. @entity14 , the top @entity15 commander in @entity4 , the official said			1
the directive comes as the coalition seeks to reduce tension between its military forces and @entity4 civilians in an effort to maintain @entity4 public support			1
nighttime raids in which troops enter private homes have sparked problems for @entity10 and @entity15 forces			1
the raids are viewed as overly invasive -- a violation of the privacy of the home in @entity4 culture -- and they can turn violent			1
the document orders forces to use @entity4 troops at night " whenever possible " to knock on doors of residences and compounds , and to use them if forcible action is required for entry , the official said			1
but the directive also orders troops to " conduct an analysis " of whether it is militarily essential to conduct a raid at night or whether it can be put off until daylight , the official said			1
if troops can keep a target under surveillance but wait for daylight , they then can enlist the aid of village elders , perhaps , in determining if a home or compound poses a threat , the official said			0
the official emphasized that troops always have the right to defend themselves and are given leeway to use their best judgment on the battlefield			0
@entity14 also is updating another directive , first issued last year , on conducting operations to minimize civilian casualties , the official said			0
the updated version , which is yet to be published , will include " more clarity " for troops on how to operate in " escalation of force " incidents , such as when a vehicle approaches a checkpoint in a potentially threatening manner and troops must decide whether , and when , to fire at it			0
the official declined to offer further details but said the aim is to make sure even the most junior troops have full understanding of rules and procedures			2
some troops and local commanders have expressed concerns that recent rules can inhibit their ability to take action under fire			0
these directives come as the coalition has been involved in several recent incidents in which civilians were inadvertently killed , and as the coalition conducts major operations in southern @entity4			2
@entity14 released a video message to the @entity4 populace apologizing for an incident this week in which 27 @entity4 civilians were killed			2
" i have made it clear to our forces that we are here to protect the @entity4 people			2
i pledge to strengthen our efforts to regain your trust to build a brighter future for all @entity4 , " he said in the message			0
the official said the documents may be made public in the coming weeks , after current operations ease .			0
