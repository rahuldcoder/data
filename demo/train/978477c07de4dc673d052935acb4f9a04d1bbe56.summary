-- a disputed maritime border			2
and tuesday , a sharp escalation of hostilities			2
@entity5 fired at each other for about an hour on an island that sits off a disputed border			0
the deadly skirmish raised fears of war between the two rival nations , once again spiking tension in the entire region			1
how did the latest hostilities begin ? @entity5 said @entity16 fired artillery tuesday toward the border between the two nations			1
two @entity21 marines were killed and 18 soldiers and civilians were wounded			1
@entity5 had been conducting maritime military drills , which the @entity5 called " war maneuvers			0
" the @entity26 accused the @entity5 of " reckless military provocation " for firing dozens of shells inside @entity16 territory around the @entity21 island of @entity31			1
plumes of smoke billowed from the island of 1,300 people but it was not immediately clear how much damage was incurred			0
many residents were fleeing to the @entity21 port of @entity40			1
why did this happen ? tension has been running particularly high in the @entity43 after the march 26 sinking of the @entity21 warship @entity46			1
tuesday 's incident , however , is one of the most serious that has occurred in recent years			0
the hostilities come as @entity16 is undergoing transition -- the ailing and reclusive leader @entity53 is believed to be in the process of transferring power to his son @entity56			1
some analysts believe upcoming internal changes have prompted @entity16 to flex its military muscle in recent days			1
tuesday 's violence was also preceded by the revelation of a @entity16 uranium enrichment program			1
has this happened before ? yes , @entity31 has come under attack before			1
last january , @entity5 reported that the @entity5 had fired shells that fell in waters north of the @entity68 , the de facto inter-korean maritime border			2
@entity16 wants that border redrawn farther south			1
over the past six decades , small - scale skirmishes have flared repeatedly along both land and sea borders as each state aims to reunify the peninsula according to its own terms and system of government			0
deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999 , 2002 and 2009			0
what is the history of conflict ? after @entity84 's defeat in @entity85 , @entity5 became a divided nation , the capitalist south supported by the @entity88 and its western allies and the communist @entity5 an ally of the @entity91			0
@entity93 tensions erupted into war 1950 , devastating the peninsula and taking the lives of as many as 2 million people			0
the fighting ended with a truce , not a treaty , and settled little			0
technically , the two koreas are still at war			0
besides the border skirmishes , other incidents also have proved provocative			0
in 1968 , @entity16 dispatched commandos in an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate @entity5 's president			1
in 1983 , a bombing linked to @entity109 killed 17 high - level @entity21 officials on a visit to @entity112			1
in 1987 , the @entity5 was accused of bombing a @entity21 airliner			1
what happened with the @entity46 ? @entity5 said a @entity16 torpedo last march sent the warship @entity46 to the bottom of the @entity118 off the @entity120 - controlled island of @entity121			1
the sinking , also in the border area , killed 46 @entity21 sailors			1
@entity5 was outraged by the incident			0
@entity16 vehemently denied any responsibility , even after an international investigating team blamed @entity16			1
the @entity130 @entity129 statement condemned the attack but stopped short of placing blame on the @entity5			0
will the two nations go to war ? @entity5 put its military on high alert following tuesday 's exchange of fire			2
but whether that will translate into further military action is impossible to predict			0
events in the past few months suggested a slight thawing of icy relations			0
@entity5 had begun discussions on the possible resumption of reunions of family members separated by the @entity148 , and @entity16 has requested military talks			2
in early september , the @entity5 offered food aid to the impoverished @entity5 for the first time in three years			0
given the closed nature of @entity16 politics , it 's hard to tell what changes the new leadership of @entity56 will entail or whether re-engagement is on the table			2
another wild card is the influence of @entity161 ; some @entity21 fear a @entity161 takeover in the event of a @entity16 collapse			1
some analysts viewed tuesday 's exchange as @entity16 flexing its military muscle in the light of its leadership transition			1
others said it was related to the nuclear issue			1
how will nuclear talks be affected ? @entity174 accuses @entity109 of running a secret uranium - based nuclear program			2
the @entity88 , along with the two @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity84 and @entity161 , have been involved in what is called the @entity180			0
but those talks have been slow , arduous and in limbo since 2008			0
and after the revelation of the @entity16 uranium enrichment facility a few days ago , the resumption of talks seemed to be in jeopardy			2
@entity188 , the @entity88 special envoy on @entity16 denuclearization , said tuesday 's hostilities will prove a further obstacle			2
@entity192 , senior researcher at the @entity193 , said the @entity5 is " frustrated with @entity174 's response to their uranium program , and they think that @entity174 has almost given up on negotiations with @entity16			2
" " i think they realize they ca n't expect anything from @entity174 or @entity120 for several months , so i think they made the provocation , " @entity192 said			0
journalist @entity204 contributed to this report .			0

tension has been high since the sinking of the @entity21 warship @entity46
a changing *situation* inside @entity16 and the nuclear issue may also be factors , analysts say
@entity31 also was at the center of a skirmish in january
