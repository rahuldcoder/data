-- many have speculated about what @entity3 's big announcement tomorrow morning will be , and the @entity5 claims that it has the answer : the @entity8 ' catalog will finally be available on @entity9			2
citing " people familiar with the situation , " the paper says that the deal was being negotiated as recently as last week between @entity3 , representatives for the @entity8 and their record label , @entity14			1
the source also said @entity3 could still change its plans at the last minute			1
@entity0 : rare photos of the band 's 1964 @entity21 tour spokesmen for @entity3 , @entity14 and @entity24 declined to comment to the paper			2
@entity3 and the group have had a long and often fraught relationship , and not just because the computer giant and the @entity8 ' custom label share a name ( which was the cause of the first legal action between the two companies , in 1978 )			1

when the group 's catalog was finally remastered and released last september , a press release simply said : " discussions regarding the digital distribution of the catalogue will continue			0
there is no further information available at this time			0
