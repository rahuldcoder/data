@entity0 -- a @entity0 judge has upheld a nearly 15 - year - old murder conviction despite a former judge 's claim that his own racial bias caused him to wrongly convict the defendant , according to court documents			1
@entity0 criminal court judge @entity9 ruled wednesday that there was no evidence that former @entity13 judge @entity12 acted with bias toward the defendant when the verdict was rendered			1
the case was revisited after @entity12 , a longtime champion of civil rights , said he believed that he denied a fair trial to a white man who claimed he killed a black man in self - defense			2
in a bench trial in october 1999 , @entity22 said he was acting in self - defense when he shot @entity25 , 23 , during a confrontation at a @entity28 movie theater 11 months before			1
" the evidence demonstrates that @entity31 applied considerable effort in his deliberations and issued a written decision , " @entity9 said in the decision			0
@entity9 ruled that @entity12 's claims of bias and prejudice were " mere afterthoughts or second guesses			0
" @entity9 wrote that was it troubling that it took @entity12 13 years to " express his concern that he may have been biased and prejudice			2
" the verdict , she ruled , should only be vacated with " compelling and credible evidence that the fact finder acted improperly as a matter of law			0
" on the issues of @entity22 's proclaimed innocence , @entity9 wrote that @entity22 failed to meet his " burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he is actually innocent for the crimes he was convicted			1
" @entity12 , who is white , found @entity22 guilty of second - degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon			1
@entity22 was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison , where he remains today			1
testifying during a december hearing on a motion to set aside the conviction , the former judge said he was convinced at the time that the defendant who stood before him was a racist who wanted to kill a black person			1
as a result , @entity12 says , he ignored evidence that @entity22 had acted out of fear and not hatred			1
@entity12 , now 86 , said in an exclusive interview with @entity1 this year , " i could n't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer 's face when i said i found him guilty			0
and the defendant on the stand , like he was pleading to me , ' it just happened , it just happened , ' and that was sort of haunting me			2
" @entity12 told @entity1 on thursday that he is very disappointed with @entity9 's decision			0
" i believe she made a terrible error , " he said			0
" i think the facts were so clear			0
judge @entity9 did n't give any credence to the fact that i said i made a mistake , and that 's very disappointing			0
" @entity22 's lawyer , @entity95 , said he plans to appeal @entity9 's decision			1
" we believe in the merits of the motion , and we 're going to proceed with an appeal as far as necessary to vindicate mr. @entity22 's rights , " he said			2
@entity95 said that @entity22 has a parole board hearing october 14 and that they plan to go ahead with the appeal , even if he is released			2
" it 's not just about getting him out of jail ; it 's about rectifying a wrong , " @entity95 said			0
@entity1 's @entity107 contributed to this report .			0
