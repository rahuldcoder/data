editor 's note : @entity2 anchors @entity3 's " @entity2 : no bias , @entity5 " at 8 p.m. et mondays through fridays			1
she delivered this commentary during the " @entity10 " segment of monday night 's broadcast			0
@entity3 's @entity2 says nonemergency legislation needs time to be read by the public and @entity13			1
( @entity3 ) -- whether by omission or commission , both the @entity16 and @entity13 get a dose of blame for not living up to the new era of transparency promised by president @entity21			1
the president 's old campaign web site still has this commitment there for all to see : " as president , @entity21 will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the @entity28 public an opportunity to review and comment on the @entity16 web site for five days			1
" well , the president broke that promise barely a week after taking office when he signed the @entity33 dealing with equal pay for men and women			1
a good bill , and certainly one that could have survived a five - day comment period			0
so , maybe the @entity16 folks just forgot ? but then there is @entity13 and the @entity42			1
how fast could you get through it ? according to the nonpartisan @entity46 , lawmakers had just 13 hours to read 1,100 pages of material that would cost the @entity28 taxpayer $ 787 billion			0
that 's less than a minute and a half per page , with no time for bathroom breaks			2
no wonder so many of our lawmakers did n't seem to notice that last - minute exemption clearing the way for bailed - out companies like @entity58 to pay out big bonuses			0
so , the @entity16 tried to clean up the mess last week by rushing through another bill -- a tax on @entity58 bonuses			0
that bill was just 11 hours old before it went on the floor to be argued and then quickly approved			0
and the list goes on well before the president took office			0
the bank bailout got all of 29 hours , the rescue of @entity71 and @entity72 was only available for 19 hours			0
this is how bills could literally become , to borrow a phrase , too big to fail -- and too fast to stop			2
the @entity46 is calling on @entity13 to allow the @entity28 people three days , 72 hours , to read a nonemergency bill online before debate begins			1
and yes lawmakers , you can have three days to read it over , too , before taking a stand			2
as for president @entity21 's promise of a five - day public review once a bill leaves @entity88 headed for his desk , it would be nice if he kept his word on this going forward			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity21 said he *'d* post legislation on web for 5 days before signing it
he broke that promise with the @entity33 , @entity2 says
@entity13 also should take more time to study bills , she says
