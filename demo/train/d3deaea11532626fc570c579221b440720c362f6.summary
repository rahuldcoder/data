@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration raised the stakes in the health care debate monday , releasing a new blueprint that seeks to bridge the gap between measures passed by the @entity9 and @entity10 last year			1
if enacted , the president 's sweeping compromise plan would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity16 and @entity17 more than four decades ago			1
the @entity18 said it would extend coverage to 31 million @entity20			0
among other things , the @entity18 said it would expand @entity16 prescription drug coverage , increase federal subsidies to help people buy insurance and give the federal government new authority to block excessive rate hikes by health insurance companies			1
it increases the threshold -- relative to the @entity9 bill -- under which a tax on high - end health insurance plans would kick in			1
as with both the @entity10 and @entity9 plans , it includes significant reductions in @entity16 spending in part through changes in payments made under the @entity42 program			1
president @entity3 's plan does not include a government - run public health insurance option , an idea strongly backed by @entity47 but fiercely opposed by both @entity48 and key @entity50 moderates			1
it also eliminates a deeply unpopular provision in the @entity9 bill worked in by sen. @entity53 , @entity54 , that would exempt his @entity56 state from paying increased @entity17 expenses			0
administration officials said @entity3 's measure would cut the deficit by $ 100 billion over the next 10 years			1
they estimate the total cost of the bill to be $ 950 billion in the next decade			0
the @entity9 bill would cost an estimated $ 871 billion , according to the nonpartisan @entity63 , while the more expansive @entity10 plan has been estimated to cost more than $ 1 trillion			1
the release of @entity3 's plan sets the stage for a critical televised health care summit thursday with top congressional @entity48			1
the @entity18 is trying to pressure @entity48 leaders to present a detailed alternative proposal in advance of the meeting			0

president 's health care blueprint @entity72 said @entity3 will come to thursday 's meeting " with an open mind			1
" the president 's willing to back decent @entity48 ideas if the two sides can have an " honest , open , substantive discussion " in which " both parties can get off their talking points , " he said			1
@entity48 leaders have indicated they will attend the meeting but have urged @entity47 to scrap the @entity9 and @entity10 bills completely			1
they characterized @entity3 's proposal monday as setting the stage for a meeting that will amount to little more than political posturing			1
" the president has crippled the credibility of this week 's summit by proposing the same massive government takeover of health care based on a partisan bill the @entity20 people have already rejected , " said @entity10 minority leader @entity102 , @entity103			1
" this new @entity47 - only backroom deal doubles down on the same failed approach that will drive up premiums , destroy jobs , raise taxes and slash @entity16 benefits			0
this week 's summit clearly has all the makings of a @entity50 infomercial			1
" senate minority leader @entity120 , @entity121 , released a statement calling the plan " disappointing that @entity47 in @entity0 either are n't listening or are completely ignoring what @entity20 across the country have been saying			2
" @entity18 press secretary @entity126 dismissed the @entity48 criticisms , arguing that @entity48 leaders had asked for this week 's meeting for months			2
" if they 're not the party of no , thursday 's the perfect venue to be the party of yes , " @entity126 said			0
highlights of @entity3 's proposal under @entity3 's plan : the health and human services secretary would work with a seven - member board of doctors , economists and consumer and insurance representatives to review premium hikes			1
this @entity146 would provide an annual report to recommend to states whether certain rate increases should be approved , although the secretary could overrule state insurance regulators			0
new health insurance subsidies would be provided to families of four making up to $ 88,000 annually , or 400 percent of the federal poverty level			1
compared with the @entity9 bill , @entity3 's proposal lowers premiums for families making between $ 44,000 and $ 66,000 , according to the @entity18			1
compared with the @entity10 legislation , it lowers premiums for families making between $ 55,000 and $ 88,000			0
the @entity16 prescription drug " doughnut hole " would be closed by 2020			0

the @entity10 bill does not include the tax , which labor unions vehemently oppose			2

insurers would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person 's gender or medical history			0
individuals under @entity3 's plan would be required to purchase coverage or face a fine of up to $ 695 or 2.5 percent of income starting in 2016 , whichever is greater			1
the @entity10 bill , in contrast , would have imposed a fine of up to 2.5 percent of an individual 's income			2
the @entity9 plan would have required a person to buy coverage or face a fine of up to $ 750 or 2 percent of his or her income			2
all three plans include a hardship exemption for poorer @entity20			0
companies with more than 50 employees under @entity3 's plan would be required to pay a fee of $ 2,000 per worker if the company does not provide coverage and any of that company 's workers receives federal health care subsidies			1
the first 30 workers would be subtracted from the payment calculation			0
as with the individual requirement , this represents a compromise between the @entity10 and @entity9 plans			2
some $ 40 billion in tax credits would be established for small businesses to help them provide health care options for their employees			2
