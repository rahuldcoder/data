when we go to major sporting events , my kids love to play the " @entity7 " game on the @entity6 screen			2
a ball is placed under a hat , and the hats are shuffled around quickly to distract you			2
if you keep your eye on the hat with the ball , you can usually find it			2
the public increasingly faces a similar shell game with climate science information			1
every four to six years , the @entity17 assesses and reviews the most recent science , technology and societal impacts related to climate change			1
created in 1988 by the @entity22 and the @entity23 , the @entity17 will begin the roll out of its fifth assessment report this week			1
in an era where some give more credence to climate predictions from rodents or almanacs , clarity is needed			1
@entity22 climate change panel releases last science for me , the hat with the ball from the @entity17 report is that it continues to affirm that our planet is warming , and humans are a significant contributor to the warming			1
@entity43 , professor and author of " introduction to @entity46 , " noted in a recent phone conversation the remarkable consistency in the main conclusions of every previous @entity17 report			1
the analysis also provides measured thoughts on implications for the frequency and intensity of certain extreme weather events			1
extreme weather and climate directly affect many aspects of society , including public health , agriculture and national security			1
navy adm. @entity64 , commander of the @entity65 , has noted that climate change is the biggest new threat to @entity69 security			1
recently , an elderly man from my church said , " @entity71 , what 's going on ? the weather is different			1
" for a public increasingly inquisitive about what they see around them , it is important to be aware of the distracting hats whizzing around and to keep your eye on the hat with the ball			0
many recent discussions have focused on " uncertainty			1
" yes , topics of uncertainty exist in climate science as in any science , but this does not render the science unusable			1
most readers would take an umbrella or expect rain if the weather forecast called for a 95 % or greater chance of rain			2
how silly would it sound to say , " do n't bother getting an umbrella because there is 5 % uncertainty in that forecast " ? climate change may increase violence , study shows @entity43 characterized the fuss over climate uncertainty in the new report this way : " the change that has everyone in a tizzy is a slight enlargement of one side of the error bar ( range of error for climate sensitivity )			1
if that 's the biggest change , then things are not changing very much			0
" another way of thinking about it is : how silly would it be for a father and mother to argue about whether their child is going to have a fever of 101.5 or 102 ? high profile legal cases like the @entity131 or @entity133 trials have increased public understanding of " reasonable doubt			0
" @entity137 ' @entity136 made a point that resonated with me			0
science does n't operate on a " reasonable doubt " basis			2
if so , i suppose we would take our chances and not grab an umbrella because that 95 % chance of rain is not 100 %			0
similarly , would most parents not take action because the pediatrician 's diagnosis has some uncertainty ? it is important to understand and respect the scientific process			2
it operates differently than a court system , business decision or legislation			0
the peer - reviewed science literature provides a mechanism to publish , scrutinize and test climate science			2
in the @entity163 , the @entity162 ensures that our foods and medicines are safe			0
peer review serves a similar role for science			0
good science inherently involves skepticism			0
however , regardless of the side of an issue , if the skepticism is always one - directional , is it skepticism or bias ? recently , the @entity17 has been criticized for being too slow or too big			1
this is a fair discussion to have , but it should n't distract us from the findings in the latest report			1
science requires time to sort out the truth from fiction , for theories to be tested or challenged			0
it is not well suited for tweets and blogs , which allow " zombie theories " -- ideas that have been debunked but continue to live on			0
along these lines , some publications are removing or limiting online comments in order to protect scientific integrity			0
as i write this commentary , i am watching football highlights			0
i debate football vigorously with my friends , but we always walk away friends			0
irrespective of viewpoint , calling people " deniers " or " warmists " is counterproductive and inflammatory			0
there are deep - rooted feelings that have created zealotry , and at times , all sides have crossed lines of civility			0
i am proud to say that i enjoy very solid collegial and personal relationships with people who i sometimes disagree with on climate science			2
climate sticker shock : @entity216 thaw could cost $ 60 trillion on the eve of the @entity17 's fifth assessment report , i still have faith in the scientific method , the common sense and keen eye of people , and human courtesy			1
these things will keep our hat with the ball .			0

the @entity17 releases its fifth assessment report friday
@entity232 : the report affirms that our planet is warming and humans are a factor
he says extreme weather and climate affect our health , agriculture and national security
@entity232 : despite uncertainty , analysis shows warming that we should n't ignore
