@entity0 -- @entity4 made drastic changes in altitude and direction after disappearing from civilian radar , @entity3 officials told @entity1 on friday , raising questions for investigators about just who was at the controls of the commercial jetliner that went missing one week ago with 239 people on board			1
the more the @entity3 learns about the flight 's pattern , " the more difficult to write off " the idea that some type of human intervention was involved , one of the officials familiar with the investigation said			1
the revelation comes as @entity1 has learned that a classified analysis of electronic and satellite data suggests the flight likely crashed either in the @entity28 or elsewhere in the @entity29			1
the analysis conducted by the @entity3 and @entity32 governments may have narrowed the search area for the jetliner that vanished en route from @entity36 to @entity37 , leaving little trace of where it went or why			1
the analysis used radar data and satellite pings to calculate that the plane diverted to the west , across the @entity46 , and then either flew in a northwest direction toward the @entity28 or southwest into the @entity29			1
the theory builds on earlier revelations by @entity3 officials that an automated reporting system on the airliner was pinging satellites for up to five hours after its last reported contact with air traffic controllers			2
@entity55 , a satellite communications company , confirmed to @entity1 that automated signals were registered on its network			1
taken together , the data point toward speculation of a dark scenario in which someone took control of the plane for some unknown purpose , perhaps terrorism			2
that theory is buoyed by word from a senior @entity3 official familiar with the investigation that the @entity71 plane made several significant altitude changes and altered its course more than once after losing contact with flight towers			1
the jetliner was flying " a strange path , " the official said on condition of anonymity			2
the details of the radar readings were first reported by @entity83 on friday			2
@entity32 military radar showed the plane climbing to 45,000 feet soon after disappearing from civilian radar screens and then dropping to 23,000 feet before climbing again , the official said			1
the question of what happened to the jetliner has turned into one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history , befuddling industry experts and government officials			2
suggestions have ranged from a catastrophic explosion to sabotage to hijacking to pilot suicide			2
the sabotage theory got a boost friday from @entity101 , which reported investigators increasingly suspect the plane 's communications systems were manually switched off			1
investigators are trying to determine whether the satellite communications system that pinged for hours stopped functioning because " something catastrophic happened or someone switched off " the system , the newspaper reported , citing an unnamed person familiar with the jet 's last known position			1
the pings stopped at a point over the @entity29 , while the jetliner was flying at a normal cruising altitude , according to the newspaper			1
@entity4 : what we know and do n't know movie - plot theory then there 's the theory that maybe @entity4 landed in a remote @entity29 island chain			1
the suggestion -- and it 's only that at this point -- is based on analysis of radar data revealed friday by @entity127 suggesting that the plane was n't just blindly flying northwest from @entity32			1
@entity127 , citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation , reported that whoever was piloting the vanished jet was following navigational waypoints that would have taken the plane over the @entity135			2
the radar data do n't show the plane over the @entity135 , but only on a known route that would take it there , @entity127 cited its sources as saying			2
the movie - plot theory seems more complicated and unlikely than one in which the plane -- its flight crew perhaps incapacitated -- simply flew on until it ran out of fuel or faced some other problem			2
but it 's one that law enforcement has to check out , former @entity149 assistant director @entity148 said			0
timeline of @entity4 aviation experts say it 's possible , if highly unlikely , that someone could have hijacked and landed the giant @entity156 undetected			0
the international airport in @entity158 , the regional capital of the @entity159 , has a runway that is long enough to accommodate a 777 , according to publicly available data			0
but the region is highly militarized because of its strategic importance to @entity167 , @entity29 officials with knowledge of the operation tell @entity1 , making it an unlikely target for pirates trying to sneak in an enormous airplane with a wingspan of more than 200 feet			1
@entity172 , editor of the @entity174 newspaper , says there 's just nowhere to land such a big plane in his archipelago without attracting notice			0
" there is no chance , no such chance , that any aircraft of this size can come towards @entity159 and land , " he said			0
the @entity32 government said friday that it ca n't confirm the report			1
and a senior @entity3 official offered a conflicting account thursday , telling @entity1 that " there is probably a significant likelihood " the plane is on the bottom of the @entity29			1
among the things being considered is whether lithium batteries in the cargo hold , which have been blamed in previous crashes , played a role in the disappearance , according to @entity3 officials briefed on the latest developments in the investigation			0
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details to the media			0
if the batteries being carried on the plane caused a fire , it still does n't fully explain other anomalies with flight 370 , the officials say			2
what is a transponder ? details of the search @entity32 officials , who are coordinating the search , said friday that the hunt for the plane was spreading deeper into both the @entity29 and the @entity221			1
@entity167 has deployed assets from its navy , coast guard and air force to the south @entity228 to take part in the search , the country 's @entity222 said friday			0
@entity29 search teams are combing large areas of the archipelago			1
two aircraft are searching land and coastal areas of the island chain from north to south , an @entity29 military spokesman said friday , and two coast guard ships have been diverted to search along the islands ' east coast			1
@entity29 officials are also including part of the @entity28 in their search , officials said			1
as of friday , 57 ships and 48 aircraft from 13 countries were involved in the search , @entity247 , the minister in charge of defense and transportation , said at a news briefing			0
@entity256 , which said it would be extending its search , said crews have searched more than 27,000 square miles ( about 70,000 square kilometers ) of the @entity221 without finding anything			0
on friday , the @entity3 sent the destroyer @entity261 to scout the @entity29 as the search expands into that body of water			1
" i , like most of the world , really have never seen anything like this , " @entity269			0
@entity270 of the @entity3 @entity271 said of the scale of the search			0
" it 's pretty incredible			0
" " it 's a completely new game now , " he said			0
" we went from a chess board to a football field			0
" @entity71 : the pilots of the missing plane other developments â € ¢ " @entity284 event " : @entity256 researchers say they recorded a " seafloor event " in waters around @entity32 and @entity288 about an hour and a half after the missing plane 's last known contact			1
the event was recorded in a non-seismic region about 116 kilometers ( 72 miles ) northeast of the plane 's last confirmed location , the @entity292 said			0
" judging from the time and location of the two events , the seafloor event may have been caused by @entity4 crashing into the sea , " said a statement posted on the university 's website			0
however , @entity307 earthquake scientist @entity305 said friday that the event appeared to be consistent with a naturally occurring 2.7 - magnitude earthquake			0
â € ¢ @entity32 response : authorities continued to defend their response to the crash			2
" a normal investigation becomes narrower with time , i understand , as new information focuses the search , " @entity247 said			0
" but this is not a normal investigation			0
in this case , the information we have forces us to look further and further afield			0
" however , @entity322 , a former @entity323 official , is one of several experts who have questioned how @entity32 authorities have handled the situation			1
" the @entity32 are not doing a superb job of running this investigation , " he said			2
" and they apparently give you some information , and then they withhold information			0
how much are they relying on and listening to the @entity335 and the @entity323 who are there with more expertise ? i do n't know , but i think you know we 've got a mixture of a very strange situation that happens to be in an environment , a regulatory environment , that really is n't capable or is n't running an investigation the way it should be run			0
" how you can help find the plane @entity349 reported from @entity0 , @entity350 wrote from @entity351			0
@entity1 's @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 , @entity356 , @entity357 , @entity358 , @entity359 , @entity360 and @entity361 contributed to this report .			1
