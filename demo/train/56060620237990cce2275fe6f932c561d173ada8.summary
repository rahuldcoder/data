@entity0 , @entity1 -- the past is a foreign place : they do things more fashionably there			1
that must be the reason for the continued infatuation with the vintage trend on catwalks , in boutiques and in stores around the world			1
but for @entity17 , aka @entity18 the @entity19 , vintage is not just a trend , it is a way of life			1
" vintage clothes have history behind them , they are from a legendary era that has been left behind by our ancestors			2
it is not a trend , it wo n't go away , " said the @entity29 blogger and fashion designer			1
the @entity34 dandies known as the " @entity35 " have become well known for their love of classic designer labels and elegant vintage clothes , but retro is being worn by hipsters across the continent			1
" vintage clothing is cheap here in @entity1 compared to @entity44 and people can source their clothes easily at open markets , that 's why it 's so popular , " @entity17 explained			1
the @entity50 , a group of young creatives from @entity0 , @entity1 , want to show off their talents through their love for vintage fashion			1
members of the group include stylists , design students and photographers			2
" i like vintage because of its quality , " said @entity50 stylist @entity60 , " the quality which you find in vintage clothes is just great			1
they are second hand clothes but no - one would believe it if you check the way i style them			2
" historically , @entity0 is not so fashionable , it 's more of a city , a basic modern city , but fashion wise we are trying as youngsters to bring it up			0
" @entity78 fashion blogger @entity77 also appreciates the quality of vintage clothing			1
" if you look at the retail stores , it 's all about fast fashion , fast fashion is what sells , and now you get a lot of synthetic fibers whereas in the past you got cotton , raw silks and those kinds of materials			0
times have changed , " he said			0
" @entity19 is people being nostalgic about the time or era that they did n't grow up in ; i mean everybody would have loved to have been born in the 1960s or the 1920s			2
so i think for some people it 's about escapism and fashion is escapism			0
" you can always turn back the hands of time in terms of your wardrobe and revisit the past , the era your mom grew up in , and borrow from your mother 's , grandmother 's or grandfather 's wardrobe and put those elements together and wear it today			0
and the beauty of it is that it 's celebrated and people see it as the hottest trend			2
" not wanting to be left behind , retailers have also been turning back the hands of time			0
in @entity124 , @entity135 , retro store " retrospective " specializes in pre-owned clothes and accessories , while @entity127 is showcasing second - hand style in @entity129 , @entity130 -- giving " new life and value to otherwise discarded clothing			1

it opened in 2010 , and with prices ranging from about $ 8 to $ 50 it is known as the place to find both unique and affordable items			0
for the owners , their love of all things vintage is nothing new			0
" i was brought up by my grandparents and i remember my grandfather used to change into three different suits a day , " explained @entity140			0
" i never once saw my grandfather in casual clothing , so i think that stayed with me and my grandma of course , in her sunday best			0
my mother and father were very fashionable people because of them , so it has always been with me			0
i think i was born with it			0
