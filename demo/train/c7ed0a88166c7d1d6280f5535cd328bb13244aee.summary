-- if you are already in college or headed there , sit down			1
if you 're the parent or friend of a student , listen up			0
one in five college women will be raped , or experience an attempted rape , before graduation			1
less than 5 percent will report these crimes to officials on or off campus , and , when they do , there 's a good chance the system will let them down			1
a handful of former students who spoke out and reported rapes at their schools told @entity0 they did n't feel protected by their universities			1
they were initially interviewed as part of an investigative series by the @entity22 , a @entity23 - based nonprofit that says it seeks to make institutions more transparent and accountable			1
the women welcomed the chance to share their experiences and offer advice to students today			1
" i was too young , still in too much shock and too emotionally gone to make decisions on my own , " said a woman who , as a freshman , reported a rape in 2001			1
" i needed an adult i trusted			1
the school did not provide such a person			0
" the shocking statistics of rape and attempted rape on campus came to light in a study conducted by the @entity45 @entity44 nine years ago			1
but the recently released series published by the @entity23 center shows that while federal law requires schools to act on sexual assault allegations and look out for the rights of victims , many higher - education institutions are n't making the grade			1
" schools are aware it 's a problem , a big problem , " said @entity55 , the center 's lead reporter for @entity57 on campus : a @entity62			1
she pointed to a " culture of silence " and said critics say , " the biggest sin is one of omission			0
they 're just not dealing with this issue head - on in a public manner with their student bodies			0
" over the course of nine months , @entity55 and her colleagues spoke to 33 women who 'd reported rapes , interviewed about 50 experts and surveyed more than 150 crisis clinics and programs on or near campuses			1
they also reviewed cases and combed through 10 years of complaints against institutions that had been filed with the @entity87			0
the alleged rape victims and others shared stories of secretive hearings , administrators who encouraged students to drop complaints and failures to sufficiently pursue the accusations and seek punishments when warranted			1
others spoke of gag orders , confidential mediations where women sat across from their attackers and feelings of being revictimized at the institutions they thought would help them			1
many said administrators appeared more concerned with protecting their employer , or the school 's reputation , than they were with protecting students			0
a number of women ended up leaving their universities			1
one student in the investigative series was written about posthumously , after killing herself			0
part of the problem stems from ignorance , said @entity118 , the director of public policy for @entity120 , a national organization committed to advancing safety for students			2
for one , he said acquaintance rapes , which dominate campus assaults , are often wrongly dismissed as " misunderstandings			2
" and lack of coordination when it comes to responses is n't helped by the fact that too few school officials are trained to understand the impact of sexual assaults			1
" people are going to do the best they can , but they only have limited knowledge based on their profession , " said @entity134 of @entity135 in @entity136 , a school that 's emerged as a model for others			0
@entity134 , the school 's director of sexual assault services , has held this position since the office was established in 1993 , making it among the first of its kind			2
she said the university jumped to action soon after then - gov. @entity153 issued in 1992 recommendations regarding campus sexual assaults			1
and while other @entity136 schools made efforts early on , @entity134 said that when @entity153 left office in 1994 , most schools folded their programs			2
meantime , budgetary woes at schools across the country mean the programs that do exist often come and go , she added			2
@entity134 said nothing serves victims better than having a clear point of contact on campus , an office and professionals who are trained -- and can train others -- to understand all aspects of these sexual assault crimes , including legal options , the psychological toll and health concerns			1
a compassionate and well - meaning professor , administrator or residential adviser , for example , may listen , but they ca n't be expected to provide full - fledged therapy or tell a student what it means to file a police report or go to court , she said			2
and a therapist ca n't offer legal navigation any better than a law enforcement officer can be responsible for emotional processing			0
the women who spoke to @entity0 described what they would have done differently if they 'd known then what they know now			2
in general practice , @entity0 does not name sexual assault victims			1
here , in their own words , is their advice : feeling invincible , an age of denial and disbelief " i wish i 'd been less trusting of my surroundings , " said a woman who said she was assaulted as a sophomore in 2007			2
" in college , you feel as if you are invincible , when in reality , trouble could be hiding behind the fa√ßade of a casual get - together or a party where you feel completely safe			2
always keep control of yourself and your surroundings , and keep a close eye out for your friends as well			0
" and if you are a friend of a person who has been assaulted , all i can say is that though it might be hard , please listen and support that person , " continued the former student , who said she was " met with a response that i never expected -- laughter and disbelief			2
because of that , i kept silent until my attacker assaulted a friend of mine almost a year later			2
" said another rape victim : " do not binge drink or leave drinks unattended			1
" reaching out elsewhere , protecting your interests " i wish i 'd told my parents sooner , " said a woman who reported a campus rape that happened in her dorm room in 2003			1
" my parents now know about it , but when it initially happened , they did not			0
i was just so ashamed			0
" you 're too inhibited to make rational decisions , to understand emotionally what 's going on , " she added			0
" whether it 's outside counsel , law enforcement , a friend or a parent , do not rely on the university to serve your best interests			0
and do n't sign anything			0
" seeking out professionals who understand " get help from a professional as soon as possible			0
i spoke with a counselor at @entity256 a few days after my assault , and that was crucial in helping me overcome this			0
there are a lot of different emotions after you are assaulted , and speaking with someone who really understands sexual assault is imperative , " said a woman who reported a gang rape by athletes in 2001 when she was a sophomore			1
furthermore , she said , " family members and friends are also victims when this happens to someone they care about			0
the technical term is ' secondary survivors			0
' sometimes it is difficult for them to deal with their own emotions and still be supportive to the primary survivor			0
secondary survivors should not be afraid to get professional help , or to speak with a counselor about their own feelings			0
that way , they are not projecting their emotions onto the primary survivor			0
seeking professional help also gives you options , and it is important to know all of your options after you are assaulted so you can choose how to overcome this			0

study : 1 in 5 college women victim of a rape or an attempt , but only 5 percent report crimes
a @entity22 investigation shows schools often fail victims
problem is lack of coordination and understanding of sexual assaults , experts say
trust less and , if assaulted , find adult to protect your interests , former victims say
