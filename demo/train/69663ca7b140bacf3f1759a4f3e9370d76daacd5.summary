-- can chicken breasts help beat breast cancer ? @entity4 officials are hoping customers will flock to help the chicken chain make a record - breaking donation of $ 8.5 million			1
but some critics are calling foul on the company 's mixed message , especially in light of the recent , heavily publicized addition of the aggressively fat - and - sodium laden @entity15 sandwich to their menu			1
@entity4 's " buckets for the @entity26 " initiative boasts a bright pink website , packed with breast cancer facts , survivor stories and a pledge to donate 50 cents from each specially branded pink bucket of their grilled or @entity24 chicken to @entity25 for the @entity26			1
the @entity25 organization funds research grants and community - based outreach projects focused on breast health education , screening and treatment			2
the @entity4 site 's stated goal is to make the largest single donation in history toward @entity25 's efforts with combined individual and @entity4 corporate contributions during the campaign that runs until may 5			1
sounds like something to crow about , right ? not according to @entity45 professor @entity44 , who maintains the @entity47 website			0
" ok , scientists are still arguing about the dietary determinants of breast cancer and are n't too worried about fat , but they do worry about body weight , " the professor of nutrition , food studies and public health posted on her blog			2
" maintaining a healthy body weight is still the first recommendation of the @entity60 , for example			0
" the @entity63 section of @entity60 's website warns , " being overweight or obese increases the risk of several cancers , including cancers of the breast ( among women past menopause ) ... " @entity72 tells @entity0 , " the goals of food companies , alas , are not the same as the goals of public health			2
food companies are businesses that must sell expanding numbers of products			0
while it seems possible that their goals and those of public health could overlap , they rarely do			0
buckets for the @entity26 gets money for whatever it does			1
sounds good , if you do n't think about it too much			0
" however , @entity4 officials tell @entity0 that they 're sensitive to conscientious customers			2
@entity4 's @entity95 said , " we have something for everyone , including people who are counting calories for health reasons			1
" " last year , we introduced @entity4 , which has fewer calories , fewer fat grams and less sodium that our original recipe chicken			1
@entity4 is the product that is featured in our commercial for ' @entity107 , ' and we are seeing lots of customers ask for pink buckets filled with @entity4			1
" it is the bucket color that is troubling @entity112 , executive director of @entity113 , an organization that calls itself a watchdog group seeking to compel the changes to end breast cancer			0
she tells @entity0 that her group believes the @entity4 campaign is based in " pinkwashing " -- putting a pink , cancer - awareness ribbon on products that are bad for health			1
her beef is n't just with the chicken chain , though ; it 's with the @entity25			1
" this will keep them ( @entity25 ) in business for years			2
they talk about a cure , but this this partnership will create more breast cancer			0
and @entity25 knows this , " said @entity112 on the assumed relationship between fast food , excess weight and cancer risk			1
@entity112 went on to say , " @entity25 puts the responsibility for health in individuals ' hands , but some people do n't have the option to take care of themselves			2
say you do n't have the money or choice -- @entity4 is making money in the poorest communities			2
" @entity25 's director of communication , @entity149 , tells @entity0 the claims are " ludicrous			1
" " these partnerships go a long way toward supporting education and direct care for over 1,900 communities across the country			0
these programs provide mammograms to women in low - income communities , " @entity149 said			0
" and people are still operating under old and crazy myths -- people ask us if they can get cancer from wearing a underwire bra			0
there is not enough awareness out there , " she says			0
as to @entity112 's claims , @entity149 says , " it 's insane to say that we 're exploiting poor people , and there 's a logical flaw in that argument			0
healthier choices are available on the menu			0
are they saying that poorer people wo n't make them ? " @entity149 added the @entity25 seeks to add $ 20 million in funding for cancer prevention research this year , atop the $ 50 million they 've previously invested			1
" buckets for the @entity26 " website states , albeit at the very bottom , that individual consumer purchases will not directly increase the total donation -- rather that the money is determined by purchases of buckets by @entity4 restaurant operators			1
despite the controversy , it seems franchisees have been flocking to help out			0
the campaign has thus far raised more than $ 2 million dollars .			0
