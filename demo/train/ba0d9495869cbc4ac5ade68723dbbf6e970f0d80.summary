-- a court ruled wednesday that @entity3 editor @entity2 will be extradited to @entity4 to face questioning over accusations of sex crimes made by two women , despite his legal battle to stay in @entity10			1
some key players in the @entity3 saga are split on how they feel about @entity2 , but they all agree the website 's future could be dire			2
@entity2 said in october that he was temporarily suspending @entity3 publishing due to lack of funds , and it 's unclear whether the possibility of @entity2 going to jail will mean the death knell for its operations			2
( the case is unrelated to @entity3			0
) " do i get personal satisfaction from @entity2 's extradition ? well , i think @entity2 took @entity25 for everything he was worth and hung him out to dry , " @entity24 said wednesday			1
@entity24 is the @entity27 ex-hacker who claimed in the summer of 2010 that @entity29 soldier @entity28 confessed to him in online chats that @entity28 had leaked classified wartime documents to @entity3			0
@entity24 told his story to @entity0 shortly after a trove of secret @entity35 war documents were published online on @entity3 and in three other mainstream media publications			0
@entity28 remains behind bars in @entity38 ; he has been held for more than a year and a half			0
" ( @entity2 's ) ego was so strong he thought he could bend light and get people to do whatever he wanted			1
he can not , " @entity24 said regarding @entity2 's loss wednesday in court			1
@entity2 has refused to comment about whether @entity28 was @entity3 ' source for its @entity49 or @entity35 war logs or other diplomatic cables it has published in the past year			2
@entity28 has not commented about his alleged involvement in @entity3			0
" i hope @entity3 is more than just one man , and that despite the extradition and the enormous pressure , @entity3 will continue , " said @entity52 , who is involved with the @entity53 , which raises money for @entity28 's defense			2
@entity52 founded the group courage to resist , which according to a document on its website , has raised nearly $ 400,000			0
the majority of that money pays for @entity28 's private legal counsel , @entity52 said , and the rest pays for numerous protests the group has staged in support of the soldier			0
@entity3 contributed $ 15,100 in january			0
" i hope @entity2 gets a fair hearing ( in @entity4 ) , " @entity52 said			1
" no matter what happens i feel confident people will continue to stay focused on @entity28 's case			0
" the @entity74 , a @entity75 advocacy group , said the extradition order could send a chill through journalism			1
" the real danger to @entity82 and press freedom is if @entity4 now decides to extradite @entity2 to the @entity29 for charges unrelated to what he 's facing in @entity4 , " said spokesperson @entity79			1
@entity85 has been a prominent defender of @entity28			0
the 80 - year - old who famously leaked the @entity87 in 1971 purposely got arrested in front of the @entity89 in march while trying to call attention to what he said was @entity28 's unjust treatment			2
" this is not the end of the story here , " said @entity85 , noting that another hearing later this month will be held if @entity2 can appeal the extradition order			1
he does n't think wednesday 's news about @entity2 will deflate support for @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity28 or the effort to leak documents online in any forum			1
" i certainly feel that @entity2 has done , on balance , a very great service to our country and the world with these disclosures he has published , " @entity85 said			1
" that does n't mean that i agree with every decision that he has made , or that he 's made no mistakes			0
" @entity85 called @entity2 a " hero " of his			1
" i would like to see him continue to operate , " he said .			0
