-- @entity2 's garden in @entity3 , @entity4 , is a well - ordered oasis filled with gentle lines of peonies and hydrangeas , artfully placed azaleas , and weeping cherry trees			1
a soothing vista dotted with various shades of pink and purple , the garden is so immaculately maintained that you would expect to see a professional landscaper continuously at work perfecting it			1
instead , on friday mornings from april through september , you will find a cheerful band of six women -- some graying , some not , most of them attired in old t - shirts or overalls and work boots			1
one day a week , they set aside their own jobs to garden as a team at one of their homes , rotating every week so that each woman 's property gets the full benefit of their collective burst of labor and artistic vision			1
@entity0 : how to negotiate anything in the eight years since the group came together , the women , who call themselves the @entity42 , have created pathways and sculptures , moved trees , and carved out acres of gardens from hillsides and overgrown bramble			1
often they converse as they work , talking about the primroses that they are mulching , the big news that a friend has just received , or challenges that they are facing with their jobs			1
other times they seem to read one another 's minds , knowing when it 's time to put down the garden gloves and just listen			2
sowing the seeds the women might never have come together except for an accident that befell 67 - year - old @entity65 in 2001			1
she shattered her knee , which left her unable to care for her garden			2
one day , frustrated at seeing her beloved roses wither away , she hobbled out to her front yard			2
her neighbor @entity71 , a painter and a gifted gardener in her own right , walked by the house as @entity65 balanced precariously on her crutches , attempting to pull weeds			2
@entity0 : how to make a good first impression although the two had exchanged only a few words , @entity71 instantly offered her assistance			2
" you point to things and tell me what to do and i 'll do it , " she said			2
as the two women walked through @entity65 's garden and got acquainted , @entity71 suggested that they might help each other out from time to time			2
then @entity65 had an epiphany : " if two people can work this way , why not six or seven ? " @entity71 loved the idea , and they started brainstorming about whom to invite			2
" we wanted real gardeners with no attitude , " says @entity65 , a psychotherapist			2
a few weeks later , a handful of friends gathered at her home			2
in attendance : @entity101 , 63 , a community organizer ; @entity102 , 63 , a nutritionist ; and @entity2 , 63 , an underwater photographer			2
also a member from the start was @entity106 , a therapist and an artist , who died of breast cancer last august at the age of 61			2
@entity110 , a 57 - year - old sculptor and architect , joined in 2003			1
@entity0 : 5 inspirational friendships at that first gathering , the women laid down the ground rules for their project : no fancy food or refreshments were to be served ( water was all that the host had to provide ) , no lawn mowing , and no uninvited garden critiques			1
" we all just wanted help with the tasks that would otherwise be overwhelming , " says @entity101			2
" we did n't have any sense of where it would take us			2
" green days in the first few years , says @entity102 , they were still in the beginning stages of collaboration , trying to prove themselves as dedicated gardeners			1
conversation tended to revolve around the names of plants and design schemes			0
but gradually , as they harvested raspberries or cleared away weeds , intimate exchanges bloomed			0
" we started talking about our families and our other passions , " says @entity110			0
" in the midst of the work , we had these gem - like moments			1
" as the women 's friendships grew , so did the scope of their projects			1
on @entity102 's property , they restored a tranquil , bluestone - paved garden that had been hidden for years by overgrowth			1
at @entity110 's place , they filled a dozen hanging planters to adorn her wraparound porch			0
and for @entity71 they lugged stones into position to make a beautiful , new border for her fishpond			0
@entity0 : how to be a good friend with each woman bringing her individual skills to bear -- @entity2 has her wide - ranging knowledge of flowers ; @entity102 , her impressive patience with weeding ; @entity110 , her sculptor 's brawn in moving boulders -- the friends have devoted themselves to helping each garden express its owner 's sensibilities			1
for @entity65 , an exuberant woman who loves color , someone suggested showering morning glories over the cottage where she sees patients			0
for @entity71 , who is as practical as she is artistic , the group has helped plant and maintain 32 varieties of fruits and vegetables			0
and when @entity106 was struck by a recurrence of cancer , they created a healing labyrinth , a circular pathway with a spot for meditating at the center			0
" we 've come to understand our labor as a concrete expression of our appreciation for one another , " says @entity65			0
on the day last august that @entity106 died , the @entity42 had come to her home to garden -- it was her turn			1
as @entity106 's grown children and their families gathered at the house and waited for news from the hospital , the friends did what they do best : hard work			0
they made breakfast for everyone , cleaned the house until it was spotless , and , of course , weeded and tended the garden			0
when the call finally came , they hugged , wept -- then picked up their tools and continued their tasks			0
" when people came to pay condolences , we wanted the garden to be as beautiful as @entity106 could have ever hoped , " says @entity110			0
that same day , @entity65 gathered up all the ripe peaches on the backyard trees			0
when @entity106 's family came back to town later that month , they each received one of the 30 pots of jam that @entity65 had made from the fruit , a sweet memory of their loved one and a manifestation of the @entity42 ' devotion			1
reaping the rewards on a hot , clear morning last september , the women were hard at work in @entity71 's garden			0
although @entity106 's death was still very much on all their minds , they focused on the tasks at hand			0
@entity101 and @entity2 dragged a tarp loaded with brush to the back of the house , where it would be picked up			0
@entity102 wielded pruning shears like a weapon in the hands of a highly skilled warrior			0
later , sitting around the table on @entity71 's porch , the friends took a moment to express what the group had come to mean to them			0
certainly their gardens had developed and improved			0
but what they found more surprising was how the collaboration had caused the women to change , too			1
" the group taught me to lean on other people , " says @entity102 , who is the primary caretaker of her 94 - year - old mother			1
" over time i 've gotten better at asking for help			0
" @entity2 felt that the no - criticism policy had encouraged her to trust more readily that " there is more than one right way to do things			1
" @entity110 says that the gardening has helped her become a bolder artist			1
" it 's easier to experiment and try new things with all this support behind you , " she says			0
@entity0 : when friendships go wrong this spring the group started up again			1
it 's even smaller now : @entity71 entered the hospital over the winter and was still there at press time , waiting to gain enough strength for a liver transplant			0
having weathered so many changes , the members are contemplating their next chapter			1
eight years in , many of their gardens are near completion			1
maybe , wonders @entity2 , it 's " time to offer a little extra help to local gardeners who are ailing or unable to do what they would like			0
" @entity101 has proposed that they start involving local children in their gardening			1
@entity0 : how to break bad habits all the women are delighted that several other gardening co-ops , inspired by theirs , have sprung up in their area , the idea taking hold like a felicitous invasive species			1
" another circle develops , " says @entity65 , " a rippling out of the concept that we can expand our joy in our gardens by including others			0
" change , growth , creativity -- these core values were never expressly spelled out in the @entity42 ' first meeting , but they have all become part of the group 's unspoken ethos			1
with the arrival of the warmer months , everyone is eager to see what fresh bounty the season will hold			0
