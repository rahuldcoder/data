" " i do n't agree with him , but everyone has their opinion , " @entity26 said			0
" i can respectfully disagree with him and he can still be an elected official			0
" while @entity26 said he had not heard from state @entity5 chiefs , the @entity37 did weigh in with a statement			2
" this nonsense is what passes for mainstream in today 's @entity5 , " the statement said			1

saying that as the county 's emergency management coordinator he has to " think about the very worst thing that can happen and prepare for that and hope and pray for the best , " @entity14 told radio host @entity62 that he believes " in this political climate and financial climate , what is the very worst thing that could happen right now ? @entity9 gets back in the @entity66			1
" why are tax hikes politically radioactive ? referring to unexplained " executive orders " and other documents that @entity9 and " his minions have filed , " @entity14 said , " regardless of whether the @entity76 take over the @entity77 , which i hope they do , he is going to make the @entity72 and he 's going to make the @entity73 irrelevant			1
he 's got his czars in place that do n't answer to anybody			2
" @entity9 , @entity14 said , will " try to give the sovereignty of the @entity82 away to the @entity52			1

' and i 've asked the sheriff			0

the two have discussed contingencies for emergency management , he said			0
the lone @entity136 on the @entity137 , @entity138 , described @entity14 with a colorful @entity2 saying : " he 's a six - pack short of a full case of beer , if you know what i mean			1
" @entity55 reported that the warning was linked to taxes			1
head " indicates a tax increase is needed to shore up law enforcement to protect us , " the station reported , adding that a tax increase is under consideration that " would largely benefit the district attorney and sheriff 's offices			1

" what makes it so sad is he is our elected county judge , who is in charge of a multimillion - dollar budget			1
it 's like the light 's on , but no one is home			0
