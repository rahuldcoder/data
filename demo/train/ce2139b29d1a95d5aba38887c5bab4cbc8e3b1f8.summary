-- @entity1 is well known for its tropical weather , retiree community and @entity6 - @entity5 population , but not so much as an international art hub			1
luckily for downtown @entity1 , billionaire real - estate developer @entity8 wants to change that			1
the real estate developer and art lover donated $ 40 million , half made up from his private art collection , to the @entity13 , known as @entity13 , one of the few major institutions in the @entity5 with a hispanic name			1
that 's certainly one way to put @entity1 on the map			1
@entity20 village found in @entity1 @entity1 is in the midst of a major revitalization : @entity23 is hoping to build a stadium there for his recently announced @entity1 soccer team			1
within the art world , the international art and fashion extravaganza @entity27 , which has taken place in @entity31 for more than a decade , is considered to be the country 's leading art fair with 130 international museum and institutions attracting tens of thousands of people to the five - day event			1
@entity8 hopes his museum will help take @entity1 to the next level			1
" cultural institutions have played a critical role in the growth of @entity1 , with this museum as a leading example , " @entity8 said in an interview with @entity0			1
before @entity8 was known as the " @entity47 of @entity48 , " he started as an urban planner , focusing on low - income housing developments			2
then , he co-founded a real estate development firm , @entity52 of @entity48 , working in high - end condo construction in the 1980s			0
in 2005 , @entity54 named him one of the top 25 most influential @entity55 in the @entity5			0
the 64 - year - old billionaire also made @entity58 list of 400 richest @entity5 several times , the only @entity55 immigrant to do so			0
born in @entity61 to @entity6 parents , @entity8 grew up in @entity63 before migrating to @entity1 as a teen			1
his lifelong passion for @entity66 stems from his upbringing			0
in his early 20s , he started collecting paintings by @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72			0
now , 110 works selected by the museum from @entity8 's private collection are available for everyone to see inside the three - story , 200,000 - square - foot museum , designed by the @entity81 - winning @entity80 architects @entity82			1
walk inside the $ 220 million building and you will be surrounded by tall glass windows that are said to be the largest hurricane impact resistant in the world			0
hanging from every side of the museum are 70 self - watering hydroponic gardens , designed by @entity92 landscape artist @entity91			0
the museum focuses on international art of the 20th and 21st centuries , and is currently showing @entity97 artist - activist @entity96 's " according to @entity99 ? " collection			1
@entity13 is one of the main attractions in what was known as @entity103 , now @entity103 -- which will also house the @entity104 , set to open in 2015			2
the @entity13 had a smooth opening last year except for one slight hiccup : naming it			2
while the majority of board members voted in favor of naming the museum after @entity8 , four resigned in protest			2
it seems they had their heart set on the " @entity13			0
" that 's because $ 100 million of the $ 167 million raised was city and county taxpayer money and the city of @entity1 donated the waterfront land where @entity13 sits			1
some of the board members argued the name of the museum should represent the city 's central art museum			1
" i can not speak for others			0
however , the great majority of the board was supportive			0
on a board of 47 , 43 voted in favor of the renaming , " @entity8 said			0
@entity8 has been involved with the museum since well before the building project began and he said he is honored the board chose to recognize him in that way			2
" i think most people want to be remembered with the causes they feel worthwhile and helped promote , " @entity8 said			0
it seemed odd that @entity13 received its share of strife for naming it after donor when just a few years ago the @entity104 's name was changed to the @entity143 and @entity104 after a generous donor who gave $ 35 million to construct the new museum in @entity103			1
" the name change has been extremely well received by the community			0
@entity143 and @entity151 are very well - liked people and they symbolize what we 're about , " said @entity149 , president and ceo of @entity143 and @entity104			0
when it comes to naming rights , perhaps @entity1 takes its art more seriously than science			2
" people have opinions about art , whereas science is a bit more concrete , so there would n't be backlash for naming a building after a donor , " @entity159 said			0
but , she points out , naming @entity1 's art museum after @entity8 carries " a sense of pride " for the @entity55 community , even though his art donation " does n't represent a collection			1
" " @entity8 is the first major donor from the @entity55 community , " @entity159 said			2
other @entity5 art museums have been named after donors , like the @entity178 in @entity179 , and have n't stirred any controversy			0
" while people may not agree on a name , " @entity159 said , " everyone can see that downtown @entity1 is quickly becoming a hub for science and art , which means donations are needed			1
" so far that does n't seem to be a problem for the @entity13 ; it has reached the 90 % mark in its $ 220 million capital campaign .			2

the new @entity13 was named after billionaire donor @entity8
it 's part of a bigger revitalization of downtown @entity1
@entity8 : museum is " a leading example " of cultural institutions helping revitalize @entity1
the $ 220m art museum is part of downtown @entity1 's goal to become an international art hub
