-- not long ago it seemed like @entity2 might be parting company with @entity4 , but now the " @entity7 " has committed to the newly - crowned @entity6 champions until mid- 2016			1
the club announced on tuesday that the @entity10 coach had agreed terms on a new deal , having moved to the @entity13 on a four - year contract in may 2010			1
" the manager has won @entity17 and the @entity18 , establishing impressive records at the club and in every championship , therefore prompting his contract to be extended , " @entity4 's website reported			1
in january , the 49 - year - old was reportedly considering quitting at the end of this season due to an alleged dressing - room rift with the team 's @entity6 contingent and unhappiness at board level after bad - tempered defeats against bitter rivals @entity32			1
he had been linked with a possible return to @entity34 , and such speculation continued after his former club @entity36 won the @entity37 for the first time on saturday under interim manager @entity39			2
however , his reported unhappiness at @entity4 appears to be water under the bridge after @entity4 ended @entity32 's three - year @entity17 title reign in fine style , setting records for points and goals scored			1
@entity2 became the first coach to win league titles in @entity34 , @entity50 and @entity6 , being the first @entity10 manager to triumph in the latter nation			1
he matched @entity53 and @entity54 in winning in four different @entity56 countries , including his own -- only @entity57 and @entity58 have clinched league titles in more nations			0
@entity2 is still seeking to become the first coach to win the @entity37 with three different clubs , having already done so with @entity62 in 2004 and @entity63 in 2010			0
he took @entity4 to the semifinals last season for the first time since 2003 , and also won the @entity18			2
this season brought more @entity56 disappointment , losing to @entity69 in the semis after a penalty shootout , but there was consolation on the domestic front as @entity4 finished nine points clear of @entity32			2
@entity2 's star player @entity76 told @entity0 last week that he thinks his compatriot is the best coach in the world			0
" this is why he wins the titles that he won			0
because for me , not just because i work with him , but he 's the best because of what he does : the tactics , everything around the players , the motivation ... and you know , the titles speak for themselves , " @entity76 said			0
" he won in every country that he 's passed , so i think that 's great			0
i think nobody ... two or three coaches do that in their lives , so we have to appreciate that			0

@entity2 extends his contract at @entity4 until end of 2015 - 16 season
@entity10 coach led @entity6 club to @entity17 title for the 32nd time
he had been linked with a possible return to @entity34 's @entity111
@entity4 ended @entity32 's three - year @entity6 reign in record - setting season
