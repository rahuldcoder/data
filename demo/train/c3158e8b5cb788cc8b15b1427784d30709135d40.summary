@entity1 leaker @entity0 accused @entity3 prime minister @entity2 of misleading the public over the country 's spying activities , as the nation 's explosive election campaign reached a crescendo monday			1
the claims were made at a packed public meeting in @entity13 's @entity12 , organized by the @entity15 tech entrepreneur @entity14 , that was billed as a " @entity16 " for the election campaign			1
@entity14 had hyped the event as a " game - changer " that could alter the course of this saturday 's general election			1
appearing onstage alongside @entity14 were journalist @entity22 , who broke the @entity1 leaks story , lawyer @entity24 , and @entity25 , the leader of the political party founded by @entity14			1
@entity0 , who is evading @entity28 authorities in @entity29 , and @entity31 founder @entity30 , who is confined to @entity33 's embassy in @entity34 , spoke via video - link			1
drawing on information contained in @entity0 's @entity1 leaks and elaborating on articles they had published earlier in the day , @entity0 and @entity22 said @entity3 was involved in mass electronic surveillance activities as part of the @entity43 intelligence partnership with the @entity28 , the @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			1
the pair said their information showed that @entity3 were subject to mass electronic surveillance via the " @entity53 " software tool that @entity3 intelligence agency the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) shared with the @entity1			1
they claimed this directly contradicted @entity2 's assertion that " there is not , and never has been , mass surveillance of @entity3 undertaken by the @entity52			1
" rather , @entity0 wrote : " if you live in @entity3 , you are being watched			2
" he also claimed during his remarks that the @entity1 operated two facilities in @entity3			2
read more : what is @entity53 ? @entity2 said in a statement he would not address the @entity53 matter , saying " we do n't discuss the specific programs the @entity52 may , or may not use			2
" but the @entity52 does not collect mass metadata on @entity3 , therefore it is clearly not contributing such data to anything or anyone			0
" @entity2 has previously told reporters that he and the head of @entity52 would resign if the spy agency were found to have conducted mass surveillance			1
project ' @entity76 ' @entity22 said @entity2 had also misled the @entity3 public when the government was seeking to pass controversial , beefed - up spying laws last year , by giving assurances the new legislation would not allow mass metadata collection on the @entity3 public			1
on the contrary , claimed @entity22 , the bill , which narrowly passed into law , was designed to enable just that			0
leaked @entity1 documents appeared to show that at around the time @entity2 was making his public assurances around the planned legislation , the @entity52 was implementing the first phase of a mass surveillance program code - named " @entity76 , " @entity22 said			1
" @entity76 , " which would have involved tapping into the @entity99 undersea telecommunications cable to harvest internet data , would have required the expanded laws to operate , and would have constituted " the greatest expansion of @entity52 spying activities in decades , " he wrote			0
the claims prompted the government to acknowledge the existence of plans for the " cable access surveillance program " for the first time			0
in a statement , @entity2 said the government had begun work on presenting a business case for the project , described as a " cyber security protection initiative			2
" but the project was ultimately shelved , he said			0
" the business case for the highest form of protection was never completed or presented to cabinet and never approved			0
put simply , it never happened , " he said			0
@entity117 , chief executive of @entity99 , released a statement saying there was " no facility by the @entity1 , the @entity52 or anyone else on the @entity99 cable network			2
" war of words the conflicting claims over the government 's spying activities have sparked a harsh war of words between @entity2 and @entity22 , with the prime minister labeling the latter a " clown " and " @entity14 's little henchman " in remarks to reporters			1
" if this loser 's going to come to town and try to tell me , five days before an election , staying at the @entity14 mansion ... he 's doing anything other than @entity14 's bidding ? please do n't insult me with that , " @entity2 told a radio interviewer			1
in response , @entity22 told the @entity147 audience it was a new experience to arrive in a foreign country and be " publicly maligned and attacked by the nation 's head of state using the most adolescent set of epithets imaginable			0
" he had not been called a loser " since i was , like , 14 years old , " he said			0
dotcom in politics a @entity3 resident since 2010 , @entity14 is fighting a battle in @entity3 courts to avoid extradition to the @entity28 , where he faces major criminal copyright charges relating to his now - defunct cloud storage site , @entity162			1
the site is alleged to have facilitated the piracy of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of films and music			0
at odds with the government since his 2012 arrest , @entity14 has gradually emerged as a significant player on the fringe of @entity3 politics			2
while as a non-citizen , he can not run for office , he has formed a political party , the @entity175 , which has campaigned on a platform of internet freedom , digital rights and opposing government electronic surveillance			1
the party has formed an alliance with the @entity183 nationalist @entity182 which , on current polling , looks set to win two seats in parliament			2
read more : who is @entity14 ? dotcom himself was subjected to illegal surveillance by the @entity52 prior to his arrest			1
the surveillance was unlawful at the time , as the @entity52 was not permitted to spy on @entity3 residents , although those laws have since been changed			2
the seizure of his electronic data by @entity28 authorities has also been ruled illegal by a @entity3 court			2
in his fight against extradition , @entity14 has argued he is a victim of a conspiracy by the @entity3 and @entity28 governments and @entity204			1
he claims his arrest in a military - style police raid over criminal copyright charges is a clear - cut example of prosecutorial overreach , and a case study in the way in which the surveillance state was being harnessed to pursue commercial interests rather than protect citizens from terrorism			1
read more -- @entity14 writes : ' why @entity3 is a slave to @entity28 interests ' he has repeatedly outlined his beliefs that the @entity3 government decided to grant him residence in 2010 -- over the objections of intelligence officials -- only in order to facilitate his extradition to the @entity28			1
he claims he was used as a bargaining chip in the @entity3 government 's negotiations with @entity204 executives over the filming of " @entity231 " trilogy			0
@entity232 were threatening to relocate the production of the films in a spat over @entity3 's employment laws , at around the same time in october 2010 at which @entity14 's residency application was being considered			2
@entity2 has previously rejected those claims , saying he did not know of @entity14 's existence until more than a year later , immediately prior to his arrest			1
smoking gun ? but in the lead - up to his event monday night , @entity14 released to the @entity246 newspaper what he claimed was an email between @entity204 executives which backed his version of events			2
he gave no account of the email 's provenance , but the newspaper reported it the email was one of the main bombshells @entity14 had planned for his " @entity16 " event			1
dated october 27 , 2010 , it purports to be from @entity232 chairman and chief executive @entity260 to a senior executive at the @entity262 , the lobby group for @entity204 studios			0
titled " @entity264 , " the purported email read : " we had a really good meeting with the prime minister			0
he 's a fan and we 're getting what we came for			0
your groundwork in @entity3 is paying off			0
i see strong support for our anti-piracy effort			0
" @entity2 told me in private that they are granting @entity14 residency despite pushback from officials about his criminal past			1
his ag will do everything in his power to assist us with our case			0
vip treatment and then a one - way ticket to @entity288			0
" but @entity232 , the @entity262 and @entity2 's office all rejected the email 's authenticity			2
" @entity260 did not write or send the alleged email , and he never had any such conversation with prime minister @entity2 , " @entity292 , @entity232 ' senior vice president of worldwide corporate communications , told @entity294 via email			2
@entity232 is owned by @entity299 which also owns @entity300 , the parent company of @entity294			0
@entity2 released a statement saying : " the conversation allegedly reported on in the email did not take place			0
people will see this for what it is			0
" @entity14 did not raise the subject of the email during the @entity12 event , and did not address questions on it at a subsequent press conference , other than to say he believed it " to be 100 per cent true			1
" @entity316 , the leader of the @entity182 , has lodged a complaint with parliament 's speaker to investigate the email			0
' dirty politics ' @entity3 's election campaign has been unusually controversial this year			0
while @entity2 's @entity323 has a strong lead in the polls , it has been hit by a string of scandals , following the publication of a book alleging the government was outsourcing its political smears to a controversial " attack blogger			1
" the affair led to the resignation of a senior minister and two official inquiries being launched into allegations raised			0
