-- in the narrow winding lanes of @entity2 , the knotted masses of electrical wiring hanging across the streets are sometimes so thickly entwined they blot out the sun. in the streets of @entity10 , electricity wires loop and run in chaotic bundles from concrete power poles			0
in the slums of @entity15 to the townships of @entity17 , electricity infrastructure is a triumph of make and mend			1
for power utilities in emerging markets , collecting the bills from this tangled skein of wiring is a nightmare and slow payment - even outright energy theft - remains a powerful disincentive for new investment in the sector			1
smart solutions one company , however , says smart meters may hold the answers to the power problems of the world 's emerging markets			1
while smart meters have been in use in the @entity42 and @entity43 for more than a decade , in markets such as @entity17 they are set to encourage much - needed investment in the sector			1
the devices not only record electricity consumption but relay information back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes			0
critically , they also require pre-payment which means that utilities that produce the power can be sure they will be paid for it			0
@entity59 , director at the @entity60 , said the company worked with the city of @entity63 outside @entity64 in @entity17 to install pre-paid smart meters to solve endemic problems of late payment , long - term debtors and electricity theft			1
" the city had two major problems , " @entity59 told @entity0			2
" the first was they could n't collect the cash from customers -- either businesses or individuals			0
they had 800,000 customers that were an average 500 days in arrears			0
" the second was that a lot of clients were stealing electricity and that 's very common in emerging markets			2
" chaotic infrastructure he said the chaotic nature of the electricity infrastructure in places like @entity17 or @entity92 means that stealing energy is easy			1
" often it 's as easy as hooking onto a line , bypassing the meter and getting free energy			2
the first major problem of energy in emerging markets is getting access to it i the first place , the second problem is that when there is access it gets stolen			0
" he said cities such as @entity15 had worked hard over the past 10 years to reduce the opportunity for consumers to steal electricity			0
" over ten years ago , some 65 % of the energy produced in @entity15 was not paid for , " @entity59 said			0
smart meters , he said , require customers to pay before they consume and also relay information back to the utilities if the meters are tampered with in any way			1
legislation is key so far , some 3000 smart meters have been rolled out in @entity63 , particularly among high consumers of energy			1
at the core of the solution , however , is legislation and @entity59 said that the city government passed laws to enforce the new rule			0
" that might not be very pleasant for many consumers but , at the end of the day , if you provide a service , it 's quite normal to pay for it , " @entity59 said			0
" if you have asked nicely for many many years and people still wo n't pay , then you have a right to enforce that by law			0
" he said the value proposition extended to consumers in that they also gained a better picture through smart metering of what and how they consumed electricity			2
ultimately , however , energy theft is not a sustainable business model , leading to under - investment , more costly production and higher prices			1
@entity59 said that @entity63 's foray into smart meters was now being viewed with interest from countries throughout the region including @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and parts of @entity162			1
" they are looking at it as a possible way of resolving the financing problem of energy infrastructure in @entity17 , " @entity59 said			2
" if you are lucky if you 've got investors from @entity170 or the @entity42 or @entity43 , who are happy to put billions on the table but do n't have any guarantee of return on investment			0
" holy grail he said that smart meters in @entity17 are fast becoming the holy grail for energy sector investors and ultimately could accelerate investment that would provide power for millions more people in the region			1
while critics might argue that consumers have gone from free , albeit stolen electricity , to electricity they now ca n't afford , @entity59 said smart meters , for the first time , could reverse the vicious circle created by energy theft			1
" the business case for the city of @entity63 is interesting , " he said			2
" energy is one of the city 's main sources of revenue and what they are saying is that smart meters are not being introduced to balance the books , but to collect the cash to reinvest it into the community			1
" even though there 's a lag between when you collect the cash and reinvest , what you ultimately create is a virtuous circle			0

the city of @entity63 in @entity17 is installing pre-paid electricity smart meters
the city has endemic problems of late payment , long - term debtors and electricity theft
it 's hoped smart meters will bring much - needed investment in the sector
poor electricity infrastructure in places like @entity17 or @entity92 makes energy theft easy
