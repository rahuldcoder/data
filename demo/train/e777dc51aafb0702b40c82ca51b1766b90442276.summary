-- the head of @entity4 gov. @entity3 's newly unveiled legal team declared that last week 's grand jury indictment of the potential 2016 @entity7 presidential contender has " no merit " and constitutes an " outrageous assault on the rule of law " that is certain to be rejected in the courts			1
" let me be clear about this , " @entity13 attorney @entity12 said on monday			0

the case centers on @entity3 's june 2013 veto of the $ 7.5 million budget for the unit run by @entity33 , after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction			1
