@entity1 fans and film critics battled to be the dominant voice at the international premiere of " @entity6 " in @entity1 wednesday night -- and it was the unrestrained exuberance of the fans that won the day			1
the scene was apparently different at the two press screenings earlier in the day , after which many critics were eager to pour out their abhorrence -- not at the movie 's sado - masochistic sex scenes but to the causes of greater offense in the critical mind -- script , plot and performance			1
some traumatized refugees of these screenings stood alongside me at the red carpet outside @entity1 's swanky @entity28 cinema , awaiting the arrival of the stars for the film 's international premiere			1
their sense of outrage had not been cooled by the chilly evening air			2
" it was @entity6 of sh * t ! " exclaimed one appalled journalist			0
but on the other side of the carpet a different story was playing out			0
several hundred fans huddled together for warmth , spurred on by a shared devotion to the books of @entity46 and the anticipation of catching an eyeful of @entity49 , the handsome actor who plays her bondage - loving billionaire , @entity51			1
they had come from @entity52 , of course , but as far afield as the @entity54			0
a man from @entity56 was in attendance with his wife and daughter			0
had he read the book ? " i read some of it , " he told me rather sheepishly , " but then i gave it back to my wife			0
she loves it and my daughter does too			0
" male opinion was relatively hard to find among a crowd in which women outnumbered men by about 20 - 1			0
some fans had come along as couples , revealing different approaches to " @entity6			1
" " i 'm @entity51 of sex , " offered a young @entity52 man , to which his girlfriend countered : " and i am @entity6 of romance			1
" meanwhile , a few hundred miles away in the @entity83 , @entity82 firefighters are anticipating an increase in call - outs when the film hits general release in a few days			1
@entity88 says it is " concerned " that the event could lead to a " spike " in people being trapped in handcuffs or genital rings			0
@entity94 broke out when the stars arrived , as fans went into ecstasy at first sight of their heroes			2
the camera crews and reporters bawled out equally hysterically , not in delight but frustration as the enormous entourage of minders and pr managers accompanying the cast obscured all but a glimpse of them			0
scuffles broke out between camera crews defending their inadequately - allocated space			0
i was wedged between a sharp piece of camera equipment from a rival broadcaster to my left and my @entity2 colleague to the right -- and it was he who inadvertently provided the most jarring moment of the evening , catching me full in the face with the back of his camera as he gamely fought to hold the line against a brute on a stepladder			0
not journalism 's finest hour , perhaps			0
for @entity49 and @entity130 , who plays submissive @entity51 to @entity49 's dominant @entity51 , it 's been a long road from the film 's notorious bondage dungeon , the " @entity134 , " to the red carpet			1
having been virtually gagged from discussing the movie for almost a year since filming ended , both seemed relieved to be able to talk about the film			1
@entity49 addressed the mayhem surrounding him			0
" we knew how many people read the books and how many cared about the film and we were kinda ready for this in a way , i 'm not shocked , i mean it 's a little bit shocking but i was aware there 'd be a lot of heat , so this is kinda mad			2
" the " @entity51 " books have sold over 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 50 languages -- the film 's forthcoming @entity157 release is this year 's hot ticket			1
but it 's not everyone 's idea of pleasure			0
voices have been raised in concern that the film could be seen as glamorizing domestic violence			1
that was denied by the film - makers on the carpet			1
director @entity171 told me : " i think they have n't seen the movie because i feel like i empower this woman and i give her the final word and the message is very strong and the message is really ' no , ' when someone crosses the line , so i 'm really hoping that people wo n't feel that , of course , and that they 'll see it very differently			1
" her leading lady @entity130 agreed			0
" everything that @entity188 does , it 's completely her choice and consensual and no person is abused in the movie and i think it 's kind of a closed - minded outlook ( to say it glamorizes domestic violence )			1
" author and director are reported to have indulged in a few verbal lashings on - set but their creative partnership could tie them together for several more years with unofficial reports of sequels in the works			2
could @entity171 make those reports official ? " it 's not official , no , but they are waiting to see how this does , so you can imagine it might do well enough for them to consider it			1
" at the box office , first signs indicate that it might indeed do well			0
some online ticket sites have reported record advance sales for an r - rated movie , with a $ 60 million opening weekend predicted			2
it will likely fare less well with most critics			2
during the screening which followed the red carpet there were several muted expressions of derision but they were more than matched by applause			0
unscheduled moments of laughter punctuated @entity51 's post-coital visits to the piano but there were also moments of well - crafted mirth , notably a scene in which @entity233 and @entity188 sit at opposite ends of a business meeting room table and discuss the contract intended to govern their relationship			1
a series of kinky clauses are discussed with admirably straight faces as @entity243 instructs @entity233 to strike out those concerning some more extreme sexual acts			2
it 's one of several scenes which support @entity171 's claim to have empowered her heroine			1
@entity130 's @entity188 may not hold the key to the cuffs but she does hold the key to the relationship and what she may or may not consent to			0
the sex scenes account for little more than ten minutes in a film approaching two hours and i 'd be surprised if many considered them shocking			2
one scene involving the erotic deployment of an ice cube could have been cut straight out of " 9 1/2 weeks , " that other notorious @entity264 movie which starred @entity265 and @entity266 , whose character would have kicked @entity51 's butt			1
we do get to see the @entity51 butt in action , but no full - frontal nudity , a modesty which is not afforded to @entity130			1
sure it has its cheesy moments and its flaws -- but it 's not aimed at winning @entity277			0
( " @entity280 " on the other hand won a nomination despite its shockingly obvious fake baby scene )			2
just as the books have been derided for literary inadequacies there 's plenty here to allow critics to take pot - shots			2
but if you 're a fan of the books , chances are you may well love it			0
and when a movie becomes an " event movie , " drawing crowds in vast numbers for a fun night out , the cheers of " @entity6 " fans may effectively pop a gag into the mouth of the most po - faced critic .			1

hyped movie " @entity51 " premiered wednesday at @entity304
critics were derisive , but unrestrained exuberance of fans won the day
*filmmakers* denied critics ' *assertion* that film glamorized sexual violence
