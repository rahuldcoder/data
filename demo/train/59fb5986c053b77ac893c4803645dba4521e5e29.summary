-- when the two most successful teams in @entity4 football meet , the stakes are high			0
not only is there the bragging rights fought for between the bitterly opposed tribes of @entity8 and @entity9 , but the result can bear more resonance than just the effect it has on the @entity15 title race			1
" winning against @entity9 is important			2
it does n't matter where you are in the league , " @entity8 manager @entity16 said after his team 's 2 - 1 victory at @entity19 on sunday			1
" @entity8 - @entity9 games are fantastic challenges			1
they are the two most successful teams in the country			0
today , hopefully , those three points will be very important			0
" sunday 's win gave @entity8 a 74 - 62 advantage in the 187 clashes between the two teams , and a season double after winning by the same score at @entity35 in september			1
just as importantly , it meant that @entity8 ended the weekend seven points clear of second - placed defending champions @entity37 , who beat 10 - man @entity40 2 - 0 in sunday 's other match			1
it leaves the club in pole position for a record - extending 20th @entity4 title -- two more than @entity9 , whose last came in 1990 , before the start of the @entity15 era			1
" i would have taken that score before the game , " @entity16 told reporters			2
" the first - half performance , and until we scored the second goal , was absolutely brilliant			0
" it was as good a performance as we have had for a long time and we should have been three or four up , but when they got their goal they got inspired by it			0
their supporters got going and it was hard work after that			0
i am just glad we won			0
" @entity8 took the lead in the 19th minute through @entity67 , who netted his 21st goal this season and a leading 17th in the @entity15 from @entity72 's low cross			1
the second goal came after @entity72 evaded his marker @entity74 and headed @entity76 's 54th - minute free - kick into the net via a deflection off fellow defender @entity79 , who was credited with the score			0
@entity72 was a focal figure last time the teams met at @entity19 in february 2012 , when @entity9 striker @entity83 refused to shake his hand before the match in their first encounter following the @entity89 's eight - match ban for racially abusing the @entity91 left - back			1
the anticipated duel this time was not between these two , but @entity83 and @entity76 -- the @entity15 's leading marksmen			2
@entity83 has almost singlehandedly carried @entity9 's attack this season , scoring 15 league goals , but it was his new forward partner @entity98 who reduced the deficit on his @entity15 debut for the club			1
the former @entity103 striker scored in the @entity105 win against @entity106 , and again impressed after coming on at halftime to replace @entity109 midfielder @entity108			0
the 23 - year - old @entity110 international was fastest to react after captain @entity112 forced a parried save from @entity8 keeper @entity113 just three minutes after @entity79 's goal			1
however , despite all the late pressure @entity9 could not force an equalizer and ended the match 24 points behind @entity8 in eighth place			1
" we 're 24 points behind @entity8 -- but we 're not 24 points behind in quality , " said defiant @entity9 manager @entity120			2
" the points difference is due to the squad -- the depth in the squads is the difference for us			0
" once we close the gap in the squad over these coming windows , i 've got great faith we 'll be able to challenge			0
i 've seen enough hope in these opening months to suggest we will do that -- and today was another example of it			0
" last season @entity37 overhauled an eight - point deficit to win the club 's first league title in 44 years on a dramatic final day of the season , and a similar effort will again be required this time			2
@entity144 's team ensured @entity40 's focus will be a top - four finish , ending any remaining hopes of title contention with a victory that left the sixth - placed @entity151 side 21 points adrift of @entity8			1
the match turned early when @entity40 defender @entity154 was sent off for manhandling @entity37 striker @entity155 in the penalty area			1
the @entity158 's 11th - minute spotkick was saved by a combination of the legs of goalkeeper @entity161 and the woodwork , but it was only another 10 minutes before @entity164 put @entity37 ahead after being set up by @entity165			2
the @entity167 striker has never scored against @entity40 , but he was also involved in the second goal as @entity155 doubled the lead just after half an hour for his 10th in the league this season			2
the only blot on @entity37 's day came when captain @entity173 was sent off for a sliding two - footed tackle on @entity174 , though the @entity176 defender appeared to win the ball			2
@entity144 said he planned to appeal the decision , even though an unsuccessful petition to the @entity180 could mean @entity173 is banned for four games instead of three			0
" this is not a red card , absolutely not , " the @entity182 said after @entity37 's first win at @entity40 in nearly 38 years			1
" he has one foot in and takes the ball			0
i think the referee made a mistake			0

@entity8 seven points clear in @entity110 after beating @entity9 2 - 1 at home
@entity194 gives @entity16 's @entity8 a season double over eighth - placed *archrivals*
@entity15 champions @entity37 keep pace with 2 - 0 victory at @entity40
both teams have a player sent off , with @entity40 's @entity154 red - carded early
