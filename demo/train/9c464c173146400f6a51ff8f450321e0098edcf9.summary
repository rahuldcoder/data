-- even at the age of 41 @entity3 's thirst for competition remains undimmed			1
but the disgraced doper 's quest to take part in a swimming event in @entity9 has been sunk before he 's even hit the water			1
@entity3 was banned from cycling for life by the @entity14 after they accused him of running the " most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program " the sport had ever seen			1
he refused to cooperate with @entity14 's investigation and was stripped of his seven @entity20 titles , later admitting taking performance enhancing drugs in an interview with @entity24			1
@entity3 had hoped to compete at the masters @entity25 in his home town of @entity28 this weekend , thinking it was not subject to @entity30 or @entity31 codes			1
but after news of his entry in the 500 , 1,000 and 1,650 - yard freestyle events , swimming 's governing body @entity33 stepped in to object to his participation			1
@entity3 's demise : how an all - american hero fell to earth now @entity3 's camp say he wo n't take to the pool			1
@entity44 , executive director of @entity45 , who are staging the event , told @entity0 : " the word back is that he is not eligible to participate in our competition because @entity33 follows the @entity31 code -- the @entity52 code			0
" and , as such , we are bound -- through a couple layers of separation down -- to our events as well			0
" so the takeaway is : while he has entered and you 'll see him on a heat sheet , he is not eligible to participate in that event			2
or any other @entity62 competition			0
" two @entity3 moves in the works @entity44 said upon informing @entity3 's camp on thursday morning , he will now withdraw from the event			1

we 're not trying to create a sideshow circus for you guys			0
he 's just going to withdraw or not show up for the event			2
' " in a statement issued thursday , @entity45 clarified its stance on the matter further			0
" @entity3 is not eligible to race in @entity30 masters swimming competitions , " it read			1
" the former competitive cyclist has been a member of @entity45 for several years			2
the spirit and purpose of @entity45 is to encourage adults to swim			0
" @entity45 is affiliated with @entity33 ( @entity89 ) through @entity90			0
" when we became aware that mr. @entity3 entered the 2013 @entity92 in @entity28 , @entity9 , april 5 - 7 , a local event sanctioned by @entity45 , we contacted @entity90 and @entity33 to clarify our responsibilities in this case			1
the event in question is conducted in a 25 - yard pool , a non-olympic course not contested on the international stage			2
" after discussion with @entity90 and @entity33 , it was agreed that although mr. @entity3 is eligible for membership in @entity45 , he is not currently eligible to compete in sanctioned swimming competitions , regardless of the type of course			2
" @entity107 has banned mr. @entity3 from competition			2
@entity33 accepts the @entity109 and @entity45 , as a member of @entity90 , recognizes and respects adjudications under the @entity109			0
" @entity3 had posted on his @entity113 account last month that he was in swimming training but he will now have to wait to make his competitive debut in the pool			1

it reads : " @entity125 , therapeutic use exemptions and hearing results or other final adjudications of any @entity129 which are consistent with the @entity109 and are within the @entity129 's authority , shall be recognized and respected by @entity33 and its @entity131			0
