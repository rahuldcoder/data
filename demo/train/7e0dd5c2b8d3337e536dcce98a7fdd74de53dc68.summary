@entity0 -- the @entity3 and @entity0 police have released surveillance video of the unsolved 2008 bombing of a @entity7 @entity6 in @entity8			1
the bureau said tuesday it released a " never - before - seen video of the suspect ( s ) and a picture of the explosive device			2
" the grainy , seven - minute - long video shows a bird 's - eye view of the explosive device and a suspect riding a blue bicycle around @entity0 between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. according to the bureau , the suspect may be linked to similar unsolved incidents in @entity0 -- one in october 2007 and one in may 2005			1
in the 2007 incident , a bomb was detonated near the @entity23 consulate			0
at that time , the authorities said the explosive device was similar to the ones used in the 2005 blast at the @entity28 consulate			2
in both cases , authorities were looking for a person seen riding a bike in the area between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. hoping for new leads , the @entity3 is using billboards and other outlets in a media blitz to encourage the public to take a close look at the newly released video			1
it also is advertising a $ 65,000 reward			2
the billboards will be seen in @entity8 and much of @entity42 , including @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity0 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
a hash tag for the investigation involving the three unsolved incidents will be posted on @entity51 as # bikebomber			0
" someone , somewhere knows something about a bomber who 's still on the run , " said @entity53 , the @entity3 's assistant director in charge in @entity0			1
authorities believe the @entity8 " bike bomber " had as many as five people acting as a surveillance team or lookouts at the time of the @entity8 attack			1
according to the bureau , the explosive device was built using an ammunition can , something more commonly found on the battlefields in @entity71 and @entity72 than on the sidewalks of @entity8			1
the can was filled halfway with black powder and detonated using a time fuse			0
although no injuries were reported , the device could have caused significant harm if people had been close to the blast , authorities said			0
a federal law enforcement source told @entity1 that bomb technicians say the @entity8 bomb was stronger than the device detonated during the @entity87 in terms of destructive capability			2
but unlike the bombs used in @entity92 , it contained no shrapnel			0
five years ago , police released a photo of a suspect , an image extracted from surveillance video			1
it shows a person riding a bicycle away from the scene shortly after the explosion			0
police also distributed a second photo showing a blue @entity106 bicycle that was found in a garbage unit nearby			0
@entity0 police commissioner @entity108 said in 2008 that there is a " possibility " the three incidents are connected			1
" the times are very similar , " he said			2
" all three incidents took place with an individual on a bike , leaving a bomb			0
so , that 's a possibility			0
we ca n't say with certainty that that 's the case , but that 's one of our investigative premises			0

the @entity3 releases surveillance video and offers a reward to get leads in a 2008 bombing
the bombing in @entity8 was similar to two others in @entity0
@entity3 : " someone , somewhere knows something about a bomber who 's still on the run "
