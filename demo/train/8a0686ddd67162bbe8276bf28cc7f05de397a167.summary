-- @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 -- many of the international chains have tried to colonize @entity6 but the city seems to have put up more resistance than , say , @entity9 or @entity10			1
@entity11 still love their little neighborhood vendors selling one thing and selling it very well -- shops of a kind apparently threatened with extinction in other big cosmopolitan cities			1
not that these often quirky @entity6 establishments are all old , family - run and hidden down a side street			1
some are new and pushing retail boundaries far more boldly than your average timid multinational			2
when it comes to shopping in the @entity27 capital , some of the best things still come in small packages -- probably one beautifully wrapped and tied with a neat little bow			2
@entity30 stuffing all creatures great and small for @entity11 since 1831 , this venerable taxidermist 's was threatened with closure in 2008 after most of the shop was destroyed in a fire			1
but with help from some deep - pocketed fans of the stricken store , including the fashion house @entity42 , its current owner , prince louis @entity36 , rebuilt it entirely			1
today , the 19th century - style interior has been restored to its full glory			2
its beautiful wooden showcases contain everything from stuffed beetles to house cats and full - sized giraffes			2
" if dead animals scare you , do n't come here , " says one fan			1

" i sell items with emotional instead of commercial value , " explains the owner , @entity72 , voicing an ethos that still holds sway among many @entity6 shop holders			1
" i buy many items from wholesalers and old factories -- they 're old but have never been used			2
" nostalgia , humor , surrealism , punk and the absurd inspire me			2
" i hope that my customers get the message : that things only have the value you give them			2

@entity100 , lemon , eucalyptus and thyme are among the 40 honey varieties representing the @entity27 regions that line its shelves			0
a pamphlet explains the putative health benefits of each -- thyme honey is apparently good for digestion , for example , and lavender for insomnia -- but the ambrosial tastes are their own advertisement			0

et voila -- @entity197 was born			0
from anti-hangover capsules to satirical board games such as @entity212 ( " @entity213 " ) , the focus is on quirky and surreal products			1
