about halfway between @entity0 and @entity1 , something magical is happening in a picturesque @entity4 town they call the " @entity6			1
" if you come to @entity8 to sip an espresso in the main piazza , feast on spaghetti with ricotta sauce or walk along the medieval city wall , you will be relaxing in a place with one of the longest life expectancies on the planet			1
is it the peaceful surroundings ? the pure mountain air ? the stress - free lifestyle ? the wonderful food ? whatever the reason , @entity8 's residents can expect to live to 95 , writes @entity27 , a @entity28 journalist who became intrigued by the village and traveled there to experience its charms and discover its secrets			1
" when i got there , i just fell in love with the place , " @entity33 said			2
" my life became seasonal and had a rhythm imposed upon it , which i very much liked			2
" she went hunting for wild asparagus , ate sugary ripe figs fresh from the tree and learned how to make pasta from the locals , just a few of the pleasures she found in @entity8			1
she believes that the local cuisine -- made up of fresh , seasonal , locally grown food -- plays a key role in the residents ' extraordinary longevity			1
try a ' village of @entity54 ' recipe : stuffed , baked eggplant @entity33 , 43 , did n't just get a glimpse into how to live long ; she also discovered how to live well , she writes in " a year in the @entity58 , " a book that 's both a love letter to the town and a collection of its recipes			1
@entity33 recently spoke with @entity63 from her home in @entity65 , in northern @entity66			2
she divides her time between the @entity28 and @entity8 but hopes to permanently move to @entity4			1
the following is an edited version of the interview			2
@entity63 : what is @entity8 like ? @entity27 : @entity8 is a classic @entity4 rural idyll			1
it 's a village that is about 1,000 years old and situated on a mountain top in the middle of the @entity75			1
it 's about 25 km ( 15 miles ) from the @entity77 coast			2
a lot of tourists tend to zip from @entity0 to @entity1 ; they go straight down the motorway , and they miss out this area inland			2
the village is just this little cluster of medieval houses made out of stone , lots of lovely stone staircases and little piazzas			1
it has a perfect circular wall , which dates from the 11th century with 12 turrets			2
lots of the houses that people live in are actually built into the defensive walls , so some of the kitchens that i was lucky enough to cook in and been invited into are literally 1,000 years old			1
there are olive trees on the slopes in the background			2
@entity63 : what advice can you offer for travelers who want to go ? @entity33 : the first thing i would do is go to the main piazza			2
it 's very beautiful , because it sort of drops off the edge of the valley so you can see all across the @entity113			2
there 's a bar on the piazza which is called the @entity117			2
it may take its name from the fact that when you 're sitting on the piazza outside the café , the moon just sort of rises like a lantern			0
it really does meet all your expectations of a beautiful @entity4 village			1
@entity63 : the town seems to be big on food festivals			1
what are they like ? @entity33 : one of the nicest times to go to @entity8 is in august , when there are two key food festivals			1
one is the festival of the " cicerchie			0
" the cicerchie is a small bean that looks a bit like a squashed chickpea , and it 's very particular to @entity8			1
it 's got a taste all of its own			0
it 's sort of sweet and musty , and it 's one of the key dishes of @entity8			1
during the festival , they cook the cicerchie in huge vats on the street			0
people come from as far away as @entity0 and @entity1 just to come and taste it			0
they also have the festival of " laine e fagioli			0
" @entity156 is simple pasta ribbons made out of just flour and water			1
it 's sort of the poor man 's pasta , as opposed to pasta that is made from flour and eggs , which is richer			1
there are stalls laid out in the village , and you can see the ladies rolling the pasta and cutting it into ribbons			1
then it 's served up to the public with sort of a tomato sauce laced with beans and onions			1
@entity63 : in the spring , you were also invited to taste the first shallots of the season , which pack quite a punch			0
how did you like eating a raw shallot ? @entity33 : it nearly blew my head off , seriously			0
think of the worst shot of vodka you 've ever had , but it tastes like onions			0
but they 're absolutely delicious fried			0
the shallot festival is just a very local , impromptu thing			1
it 's not an organized festival			0
but if you happen to be in the village around that time , you 'd be very welcome to try them out			1
@entity63 : where can you stay or eat in @entity8 ? @entity33 : there is a hotel called @entity205			1
the quality of food in the local restaurants is amazing			1
it 's all locally sourced			0
the standard method of raising produce is organically			0
they do n't even bother using the word " organic " because it 's just so normal to them , there 's no need to use the phrase			0
so it 's all locally grown fruits and vegetables			0
a lot of the restaurants serve goat or wild boar , which is hunted on the hills			0
@entity63 : you were eating so many delicious things when you lived in the village			1
did you lose weight or gain weight during your time there ? or did you even care ? @entity33 : i did n't really care too much			0
but i did lose a lot of weight , despite the fact that i must have been eating a lot more calories			0
everything has a lot more olive oil			0
i just put olive oil on everything , and i still do			0
i really think it 's the elixir of life			0
i think the weight loss is probably due to the lack of stress			2
i always have this theory that it would make sense that if your body is full of adrenaline , your fight - or - flight mechanism is going to tell your body to conserve fat			2
@entity63 : how do you get to @entity8 ? @entity33 : if you are in @entity0 or @entity1 , you can get a train , which runs directly between those two cities and jump off at the town of @entity259			1
it 's much easier to go by car			0
if you come down from @entity0 , which takes about an hour and 40 minutes , you would actually travel along the @entity262 ( the ancient @entity262 ) so it 's a very historic route			0
once you get outside of @entity0 , it 's very much green fields and blue skies			0
once you turn off the major roads , you 're actually traveling upland into the mountains , so there are lovely winding roads and green tunnels of trees			2
the only thing i would say is , watch out for cows on the road			0
do n't speed , because the cows just stand in the @entity278 , and they just look at you			0
at nighttime , you 've got to watch out for the wild boar , which run along the road as well .			0

residents of idyllic @entity8 , @entity4 , can expect to live to 95
the lovely village has peaceful surroundings , pure mountain air and a stress - free lifestyle
author @entity27 was enchanted by the freshness of the food and the local cuisine
the village has two big food festivals in august , *celebrating* beans and pasta
