@entity0 -- president @entity2 postponed military exercises with @entity4 last week due to intensifying violence between the military and supporters of ousted president @entity8 , and warned of potential " further steps			2
" much of the discussion since has focused on the fate of $ 1.2 billion in @entity13 military aid , and defense secretary @entity14 reiterated on monday that " every aspect " of the @entity13 - @entity4 relationship is on the table			1
@entity2 warns of further steps in @entity4 but what does that mean exactly and how much leverage does the @entity13 have on @entity4 affairs ? beyond military support , would holding up financing for economic programs have an impact ? what about immigration and visa programs ? would any new action on these issues change the behavior of the @entity4 military ? more than half of all @entity13 in a new poll believe the @entity13 should halt military aid			1
but experts tell @entity1 that relations are complex			2
" the @entity13 is kind of in a ' damned if you do , damned if you do n't ' situation , " said @entity39 , associate director for research at the @entity41			2
@entity44 : @entity13 military aid to @entity4 : an iv drip , with side effects what does the @entity13 want ? for @entity50 , director of the @entity51 at the @entity52 , the question really is : what does @entity0 want to accomplish ? " if you are trying to change the decision - making process of the @entity4 military -- that is very hard to do right now because they believe they are locked in an existential struggle			1
if what you are trying to do is demonstrate our resolve to the rest of the world and people looking on , that is another issue			0
" @entity4 on edge amid questions of @entity13 aid though @entity71 , senior fellow at the @entity72 , says military assistance is pretty much the only card the @entity13 can play to enforce its call for an end to violence and quick return to civilian rule			1
" if we mean what we say , than the next step is to suspend our military aid until the @entity4 mean what they say -- which is that they are looking for a political compromise , " @entity80 said			1
not a one - sided relationship military jets , helicopters and other equipment provided by the @entity13 supports a trilateral peace in the region involving @entity4 , @entity94 and @entity95 , which is the largest recipient of @entity13 military aid , and related strategic advantages			1
for instance , the @entity13 has been granted preferential use of the @entity101 -- an economic hub that connects the @entity103 and the @entity104 -- and overflight rights , which gives the @entity13 military the ability to fly over @entity4 on the way to bases in the region			1
but would @entity4 respond to cuts in its aid by restricting access to the @entity113 and its air space ? unlikely , said @entity80 and @entity39			1
" the @entity101 is extremely important			0
it is important to international commerce , " @entity115 said , adding that he doubts " these privileges will be changed " if aid is suspended			0
will cutting aid do anything ? the @entity2 administration has decided to not call the military 's ouster of @entity8 a coup , which would require an end to military assistance under @entity13 law			1
but sen. @entity129 , a leading authority on military matters in @entity132 , recently returned from @entity4			2
he said turning off aid in response to the military crackdown on protesters is more than necessary now			0
" we have no credibility			0
we do have influence , but when you do n't use that influence , then you do not have that influence , " @entity129 said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity139			0
" about half of the money for military assistance this year -- reduced somewhat by budget cuts in the @entity13 -- has been delivered , according to the @entity148			2
@entity4 gets another $ 250 million for economic programs			0
and a new @entity151 survey of 1,000 adults nationwide conducted thursday through sunday showed that 51 % of @entity13 believed it was better for @entity0 to cut off military aid to put pressure on the government , while 26 % said it was better to continue aid to maintain influence			1
with such complexity in the region -- from trading rights to diplomatic advantages -- would cutting aid be an effective way to change policy in @entity4 ? likely , no , said the experts -- particularly because @entity166 has said it would consider matching the @entity13 assistance if the administration does decide to cut it			1
" our @entity132 is not about to compete with that amount of money in @entity4 , " @entity80 said			0
" ( the @entity166 ) have deep pockets and they are ready to put them in @entity4 's disposal			1
" there is little agreement among experts over whether such a cut would make any difference			0
" whether or not changing the aid policy is good for the @entity13 in the long run , my answer to that is yes , " @entity39 said			2
" if we diversify our engagement with @entity4 and deepen it beyond the rhetoric we hear , not only the @entity2 administration , but any administration after would have for more policy flexibility			0
" @entity50 , on the other hand , sounded a warning			0
" it is easier to cut things than resume them , " he concluded			0
" what you may have instead of sending a warning shot that gets @entity4 to change their behavior , you may have a spiraling down in our relations			2
" @entity1 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			0

experts say relations between the @entity13 and @entity4 are more *complicated* than military aid
expert says cutting off aid will do little to change @entity4 regime 's behavior
@entity166 has promised to make up for any aid that the @entity13 cuts
@entity4 could retaliate to cutting aid by changing @entity13 preferential access to @entity101
