" the drills will include anti-sub infiltration exercises , said @entity29			0
@entity30 of the @entity3 @entity31			2
" the anti- sub-infiltration exercise works like this : if a sub is coming in to attack a ship , the military finds it and prosecutes it , " he said			0
@entity30 said there was a " renewed desire " and urgency to focus on the exercise after the @entity23 sinking			0
@entity2 criticized the exercises , which began at 6:30 a.m. ( 5:30 p.m. et )			2
" the @entity3 provocations amount to trespassing on the off - limits fixed by the @entity2 and it , therefore , feels no need to remain bounded to the off - limits drawn by the @entity3 , " the state - run @entity44 quoted a @entity2 foreign ministry spokesman as saying			1
it continued , " it is the mode of the @entity2 's counteraction to react to sword brandishing in kind			2
the @entity2 is prepared for both dialogue and war			2
it will remain unfazed by military threat and sanctions			0
" @entity2 on saturday heightened its threats against the military exercises after talks over the sinking of the @entity23			1
@entity2 " will legitimately counter with [ its ] powerful nuclear deterrence the largest - ever nuclear war exercises to be staged by the @entity3 and the @entity4 puppet forces , " @entity44 reported			1
two @entity3 military officials told @entity0 there was no sign of significant troop movement in @entity2			1
@entity74 sen. @entity73 of @entity75 , the chairman of the @entity76 , answered " no " when asked if there was a real threat of a @entity2 military attack over the @entity3 - @entity4 exercises			1
" i think @entity2 is just too interested in their own survival to do anything that could end that regime , " @entity73 said in an interview broadcast sunday on @entity83 's " newsmakers " program			1
meanwhile , friday , in the demilitarized zone between the two @entity91 , officers from the @entity2 sat down for talks about the @entity23 incident with their counterparts in the @entity3 - led @entity95			1

" an international inquiry found @entity2 culpable for the march attack that killed 46 @entity4 sailors			1
but @entity2 denies a role in the incident , which elevated tension between the two enemies			0
@entity2 demanded again friday that it be allowed to conduct its own investigation of the @entity23 's sinking and said the upcoming war games are being conducted under false pretext			2
" the @entity3 forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [ @entity2 ] through large - scale war exercises , " @entity44 said			1
" it should immediately stop the [ @entity126 ] nuclear war racket			0
" at an @entity127 ( @entity127 ) meeting last week , nation after nation expressed deep regrets and offered condolences to the @entity4			0
the @entity3 has accused @entity2 of aggressive behavior and imposed new sanctions wednesday			1

later , after a repatriation ceremony for the remains of three soldiers who died in the @entity145 , @entity141 said the door remains open for dialogue if @entity2 commits to abandoning its nuclear weapons program			0
" we would love for them to have the same opportunities that the people of @entity4 have been able to enjoy for the last 60 years , " @entity141 said			0
" so , it is distressing when @entity2 continues its threats and causes so much anxiety among its neighbors and the larger region			0
