even their long range efforts were dealt with			0
in the 70th minute , @entity46 's 25 - yard drive fizzed towards goal only for keeper @entity31 to produce the save of the match and push the ball to safety			0

the goal stirred a defensive - minded @entity61 into life forcing them onto the front foot , but their new found urgency failed to create any chances of merit as a succession of promising moves came to nothing			2
@entity134 should have doubled @entity65 's in the 38th minute , when he latched onto a loose ball on the edge of @entity61 's penalty area			1
the @entity139 striker fired low , but straight at @entity123 , who comfortably saved with his feet			0

but the win was confirmed when @entity152 was given an age to tee up @entity97 on the edge of the box who wasted no time in smashing the ball past @entity123			2
@entity145 went close for @entity61 in injury time , but he and his team toiled fruitlessly in search of a goal for most of the game while @entity65 , who with @entity141 , @entity164 and @entity114 had class to spare in midfield .			1

@entity1 held to 1 - 1 draw by @entity4 in @entity8
@entity10 puts @entity170 ahead after seven minutes before @entity1 equalize through a penalty
