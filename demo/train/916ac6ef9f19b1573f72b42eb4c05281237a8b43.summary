i was 8 when i watched my first and only @entity3 parade in my home in @entity5			2
back then , long before @entity8 's population swelled to its current 20 million , the streets seemed wide and open and my eyes feasted on a sea of saffron , green and white , the colors of my country 's flag			1
the annual january 26 parade celebrates the day in 1950 when a newly independent republic of @entity5 adopted its first constitution			2
it 's @entity5 's showiest moment of pride , when patriotism trumps all and the nation lays out its culture , accomplishments and military might for the world to see			1
this year , president @entity27 will see the festivities firsthand			1
he 's the first @entity29 leader @entity5 has invited to be the guest of honor and the first president to visit @entity5 twice in his tenure			1
that 's a sign , i believe , of how far @entity5 has come from the nation of my childhood			1
back then , i stood in the crowd thinking of things i learned in school about @entity5 's rich history and valiant struggle for freedom from @entity45 colonizers			1
but it was impossible to forget i was born in the " @entity47			1
" signs of poverty and despair were everywhere			1
i often heard this refrain : " @entity52 shall rise again			2
" but i held no expectations , no hopes , really , that my homeland would ever be any different			1
but over the last two decades , i have been going home to a radically transformed @entity5 , one that has experienced immense economic growth and social change			2
now , @entity27 is making history with his trip			1
he 'll stand with prime minister @entity63 on @entity64 , the grand avenue that leads to @entity66 , @entity8 's version of the @entity68			1
@entity27 will also be meeting @entity63 for the second time within the span of a few months ; the two met at the @entity72 at the end of september on @entity63 's first trip as prime minister to the @entity29			1
all this indicates @entity5 's arrival on the global stage			1
@entity79 of the @entity80 put it this way : " it 's a big deal			1
there 's no better way to put it			1
" @entity63 's invitation to @entity27 , say @entity5 experts , is a simple but extremely important gesture that could jump - start relations between the two countries			1
@entity63 's a controversial figure ; some blame him for doing nothing to stop a massacre of @entity94 in @entity95 , the western @entity5 state where he was chief minister			1
but @entity5 voted him into the highest office of the land in a roaring landslide victory			2
they were fed up with years of stagnation and government corruption and in @entity63 , they saw the man who can again make @entity5 prosper			2
so , apparently does @entity27			1
@entity106 expert @entity105 told me the @entity72 has been waiting a long time to conduct business with @entity5 with confidence			0
" in @entity63 , they believe they have found that elusive leader , and they do n't want to pass up the opportunity , " says @entity105 of the @entity111			0
both @entity5 and the @entity29 want a strong economy and a strong defense			0
a good guess is that the leaders of the world 's two largest democracies will talk trade and terrorism			1
they are also likely to take up the issue of @entity127 dominance			0
besides @entity128 , @entity5 is @entity29 's strongest ally on that matter			1
" we really talk about it more as not a counterweight to @entity127 , but you want a multipolar @entity106 future , " says @entity79 of @entity80			0
" you know , you want multiple sources of power in any jurisdiction , and we would love for @entity5 to be because , of course , we 've got an alignment of values			0
" that last point got me thinking about @entity5 's growing prominence and what the world might look like 50 years from now in terms of power			1
@entity29 may not be the sole superpower anymore			0
and that refrain from my childhood could be ringing true after all			0
people in the @entity154 often talk about the emergence of @entity5 on the world stage			0
but that 's because they do n't know the history of my homeland : that for centuries , @entity5 was one of the richest countries in the world -- until the @entity164 swallowed it up and left it destitute			1
the @entity45 even stole the famous @entity166 diamond and stuck it on the queen 's crown			1
i recently read a story in the @entity5 news magazine @entity170 that mentioned a 1983 study of the world economy that created quite a stir among @entity175 economists			0
the study said that in 1750 , @entity127 owned 33 % of the global gdp and @entity5 , 24.5 %			0
in the same year , the combined share of @entity45 and the @entity29 was a mere 2 %			0
a subsequent analysis found that @entity5 had the largest economy in the world for 1,700 of the past 2,000 years			0
so to call @entity5 an emerging power is silly			0
if anything , my homeland is re-emerging as the global power it once was			1
@entity5 , of course , has a way to go to catch @entity127 , although it has already outranked @entity128 as the third largest economy			0
opinion : " why 2015 will be a defining year for @entity5 " economic historian @entity190 has predicted that by 2040 , the @entity127 economy will reach $ 123 trillion			0
that 's three times the economic output of the entire globe and quite staggering when you consider that @entity127 was considered a poor country in 2000			1
@entity190 thinks @entity127 's per capita income will hit $ 85,000 , more than double the forecast for the @entity198			1
@entity127 's gdp at 40 % will dwarf @entity29 's 14 %			2
but some economists think that @entity5 has a chance to leap over @entity127 in about 50 years			0
the most recent @entity203 forecast says growth in @entity5 is likely to outdo @entity127 's			2
granted , it 's a prediction that has been made before and @entity5 has disappointed			2
but now with @entity63 in the driver 's seat , many experts are hopeful that @entity5 can resolve problems of political stasis and take off like it was supposed to have done a decade ago			2
@entity5 , says @entity79 , is destined to become another pole of power			0
" @entity5 is a large country that will be population-wise , in the next 20 years , probably surpassing @entity127 , " says @entity79			2
" @entity214 , it 'll be a rival and growing quite heavily			0
" that 's why my city councilman in @entity219 , @entity220 , is visiting @entity5			2
coincidentally , he will be there at the same time as @entity27			1
i recently spoke with @entity220 about why he is going on the @entity222 - sponsored trip			2
" the geopolitics of the world and its economic focus has shifted and it will continue to shift @entity152 , " @entity220 told me			0
" @entity5 is a very significant player			0
" @entity220 , of course , is interested in strengthening @entity5 business ties with the city of @entity219 , home to more than 100,000 @entity106 immigrants			0
he says he is impressed by the burgeoning middle class in @entity5 and by the fact that @entity5 is rooted in democracy , unlike @entity127			0
@entity5 has the advantage of leapfrogging its development , says @entity220			0
@entity5 are innovating above and beyond what was normal in the @entity154 and they have the advantage of learning from mistakes made by developed nations			0
" they have a chance to address education , poverty and heath care in a wholesale way , " says @entity220			2
" whichever emerging superpower brings its people along the best will be the most dynamic			0
the human element is what people always leave out			0
" @entity27 , says @entity220 , has every reason to reach out to @entity63 , a man who began as a " chai wallah " -- a tea seller -- and became prime minister of @entity5			1
that , after all , is the @entity257 realized in the land of my birth .			0

as a child , i felt pride in my homeland 's valiant history
but i could not forget i was born in a " @entity47 " country *plagued* by poverty
@entity27 's trip signifies how far my country has come
