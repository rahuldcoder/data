" if you ca n't eliminate injustice , at least tell everyone about it			0
" the @entity5 proverb opens a book about the @entity8 revolution by @entity9 , a human rights lawyer who became the first @entity11 woman to win the @entity12 in 2003			1
but there could not be a more appropriate line to sum up @entity9 's own life			1
" i am always being faithful to this motto , " she said friday from @entity17 , in the midst of an eight - city speaking tour in the @entity21			0
" and that 's why i travel all the time and talk about it			2
" forced from her homeland in 2009 , after @entity28 's crackdown on post-election protesters , @entity9 has lived in @entity30 and @entity21			1
she said she has spent too many nights alone in hotel rooms , fearing for the lives of her husband and sister who were jailed and beaten			0
and , for her own safety			0
" the government continuously threatens to kill me , " she said			0
" all of this is in order for me to stop what i am doing , and i am not going to stop			0
" she has taken up seemingly intractable cases in the @entity44 's judiciary , defending intellectuals and dissidents and fighting for the rights of abused women and children			1
'' in my view , there is no difference between @entity55 and human rights , " @entity9 said when she accepted her @entity50			1
" therefore , the religious ones should also welcome this award			0
the prize means you can be a @entity11 and at the same time have human rights			1
'' the accolade did not sit well with @entity28 's clerics			2
the @entity55 republic banned her autobiography , confiscated her @entity50 medal and diploma , froze her bank accounts and , closed down the @entity69 she founded			1
" if they did n't fear me , they would n't do what they did , " she said , " because they do n't want human rights violations to be brought to the attention of the world			1
" @entity9 remains hopeful that change can come to her homeland -- change that will restore equality for women that vanished after the 1979 revolution			1
@entity9 was in her early 30s then and @entity8 's first female judge			1
but overnight a new penal code reduced the worth of a woman 's life to half that of a man 's			2
in her 2006 memoir , " @entity98 , " @entity9 wrote how the new laws affected everything in her life , from her job to her marriage			1
she was demoted to a secretary in the same court over which she once presided and in her relationship with her husband , @entity102 , she wrote : " he stayed a person and i became chattel			0
" now she looks at the anti-government uprisings in other @entity108 nations -- @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 -- and ca n't help but think it is too soon to judge the change			1
" it 's too early to speak about democracy , " she said			2
" they are still in turmoil in these countries			0
at this time , i do n't see a progress in the status of women			2
" @entity9 fears that talk of @entity126 , or @entity55 law in @entity109 , for instance , could hurtle women backwards in time , in the vein of @entity8			1
" the possibility is there , " she said			0
" we are concerned about the situation going backward for women			0
" she remains optimistic as ever that change can come to @entity8			1
in her lifetime ? it depends on how long she will live , joked the 64 - year - old lawyer			0
" could be one week from now or 10 years			0
" she feels certain it will be accelerated if president @entity141 is ousted after months of bloody uprising in next - door @entity112			1
he has been such a puppet of @entity8 , @entity9 said , that his demise will surely have repercussions			1
" if @entity141 falls that will be the beginning of the fall the @entity8 regime , " she said			1
the situation within @entity8 has deteriorated in recent months , she said			2
a crackdown on the opposition in the months following the 2009 presidential election was followed by a recent series of harsh international measures designed to punish @entity28 for its suspected nuclear program			0
the @entity21 and its allies allege @entity8 is enriching uranium in order to build a bomb , a claim that @entity8 vehemently denies			2
the government also claims that most @entity8 are supportive of their nation 's nuclear drive and that , said @entity9 , is simply not true			1
for one , @entity8 realize they are sitting on an earthquake fault and maintaining nuclear reactors could trigger a disaster like @entity167 in @entity168			2
they also want to see an end to the sanctions that have made it increasingly hard for ordinary people to make ends meet			0
" the situation of people is worsening , " @entity9 said			2
" the sanctions have impacted their lives			0
inflation has gone up , the prices have gone up			0
" i do n't agree with sanctions that hurt people			0
i agree with sanctions that hurt the government			0
" her message to @entity21 is clear : never equate the people of @entity8 with the policies of its government			2
@entity9 has been separated from family in @entity8 since june 2009			1
but there 's no trace of self - pity in her words			0
in the little down time she has , she likes to watch movies and read literature , though there is nothing light on her current list			0
she watched " @entity202 , " the @entity8 movie that took @entity205 audiences into the home of a @entity28 family and won the @entity208 for best foreign film this year			1
@entity9 said she liked that the movie portrayed a woman 's desire to leave bad conditions in @entity8			1
and she is reading " my share , " the first novel by @entity215 that tells the story of an @entity8 woman forced to marry a man who puts revolutionary ideals over his family responsibilities			2
the book is , perhaps , symbolic of many @entity8 women and raison d'etre for @entity9			1
in the years since her @entity50 , many words have appeared in the same sentence as her name : pioneering , courageous , troublemaker , stubborn , activist and dissenter			0
if you ask @entity9 to describe herself , she offers only this before bidding farewell			2
" i am a woman			0

@entity9 was @entity8 's first female judge but was *stripped* of her job after the revolution
she warns that women may not gain from changes *sweeping* the @entity241 world
she won the @entity12 for her human rights work in the @entity55 republic
she says @entity141 's ouster in @entity112 could accelerate change in @entity8
