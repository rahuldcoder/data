-- my mom was always sports mad -- my dad not so much			1
but both my parents understood the importance of significant events , so when opportunity knocked , my parents opened up all doors for me			1
i grew up knowing full well that my country was n't allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on @entity14 in a protest against apartheid -- a system of racial segregation enforced by the ruling white minority			1
so when the @entity20 toured @entity21 in 1981 , my parents made sure that i was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three test matches			1
i got to snuggle between my parents -- and a first -- they put the television in their bedroom			1
it was the " flour bomb " test -- where a light aircraft flew over @entity29 's @entity28 before and during the match , dropping flour bombs , smoke bombs and anti-apartheid leaflets -- where i began to realize that other countries did n't like us			1
i did n't understand why at the time , and it hurt a little			2
later that day , i 'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before i witnessed something like this again			2
i was six at the time			2
they were right ; i would next see these two teams play as a 17 - year - old			2
first trip my first trip to @entity46 's @entity45 was to watch @entity47 play a domestic match			2
it must have been my mom 's first trip too , because i distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment , which was reserved for colored people			2
confused , we sat down			2
a kind couple offered us some fruit , so we stayed			2
i was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was			2
we returned a couple of years later to watch my first " @entity59 " match : @entity14 vs. the @entity60			1
this time we were seated in the correct place , in the @entity62 , which ironically these days is a grass embankment			2
i remember the hype and the excitement about this special day			2
i had seen the @entity60 in their warmup game against @entity47 and i knew that they were something special			2
they had vicious fast bowlers and flamboyant batsmen			2
we got there early , along with thousands of others , just to watch the warmups			2
i do n't remember much about the games -- i remember more about the players			1
they were heroes to us			2
perhaps there was some curiosity too , something about the islanders from far , far away on our shores			2
we used to follow them around the boundaries of the ground , hunting their prized autographs			2
and their accents -- just too cool			0
did n't see color i know i did n't see the color			0
i do n't think most kids did -- they were just cricketers			0
at the end of play we would run on the field to try to touch them and grab one more autograph			0
somewhere there is footage of me congratulating @entity100 by patting his back			0
i remember telling all my friends that i had touched the great bowler			0
while i had forgotten about it , listening to @entity105 speak reminded me of the time we were trying to get him to drink from some kid 's @entity108			0
he obliged and we all simply went crazy			0
i realize the significance of that event now			0
imagine a black guy drinking from the same can ? perhaps our parents would have flipped out , but this was n't about color to us			0
other memories include how obliging and friendly they were			0
@entity119 to give autographs and happy to interact positively with the huge crowds			0
branded a rebel it was with incredible interest and fascination that i watched " branded a rebel " -- a @entity128 documentary which first screened last year			1
it gave me greater insight into the players , the tour , @entity60 cricket and indeed my home country			1
and while " branded a rebel " is an appropriate title for the program , it could have just as easily been titled " @entity139			1
" that 's what they were to us white @entity14 , and i think deep down the @entity60 players felt that too			1
it 's all about what side of the line you were sitting , i guess			0
on their return home , the @entity150 players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living			1
the poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions			1
i started thinking what we as @entity14 could have done for them			1
could we have done more ? did we look after them well enough after the fact ? it 's a difficult one			0
these men did n't deserve it , no matter what choices they made			0
strangled by hatred it eats me up to think what those players endured upon their return			1
they were strangled by such hatred in their home countries , and yet i wish they somehow knew what they had done for young cricket fans like me			1
i got to see " real " international cricket played at the " highest " level			1
i got to meet new cricketing greats			0
i got to bowl like @entity100 , @entity188 and @entity189			0
i got to emulate @entity191 's great wicketkeeping skills on @entity192 , field like @entity194 and admire the patience and masterful batting of the great @entity197			0
and something else -- they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field			0
their smiles , i 'll never forget their smiles			0
each of their names is entrenched in my memory , and of all of those who saw the matches			1
they became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of @entity14 fans			1
what i did n't understand at the time , was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores ( money aside )			0
they must have been scared -- really scared			0
i know i would have been			0
in the interview with @entity225 , longtime captain of the official @entity60 team that dominated world cricket for two decades , he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime			1
i would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel to @entity14			1
courage it 's not for me to judge , but those men were courageous			0
in their cricket and in their collective decisions , and i respect that			1
a few years later , i did wonder how the black @entity150 players got to travel using " white " transport and stay in " white " areas			1
i remember asking my mom how that worked			0
she did n't know , but you could see that my political curiosity was growing			0
i was disappointed that more players did n't take up the opportunity of being interviewed for the documentary			1
i was intrigued by @entity105 , @entity188 and @entity191 's thoughts , motives and reflective answers			0
there seemed no real regret , which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason			0
as for those who declined an interview , their wounds obviously cut deep			0
@entity105 was just how i remember him			0
boisterous , bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life			0
we got to know him well here , as he returned to play for the @entity268			0
the fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him , and that he feels part of change and change of attitudes in @entity14			1
i do n't know if they changed us as a society but i 'd like to thing so , even if it was an indescribably fractured and dysfunctional society			1
and by this i mean that white @entity14 packed out every cricket ground to watch black @entity60 , went home and made sure that " @entity290 " was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything			1
heart bleeds " branded a rebel " showed balanced reporting			1
i like the fact that you saw the tour from a @entity14 perspective as well			1
great players like @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 also effectively served life bans for being , well , @entity14 , and the program understood that			1
i know that , fundamentally , the tour was morally corrupt , but for an innocent nine - year - old devoid of political allegiances and beliefs , it was simply a chance to see the world 's best cricketers entertaining us on the world 's most beautiful stage			0
ultimately , i 'd also like to believe that @entity14 cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward , and that unity through sport was possible .			1
