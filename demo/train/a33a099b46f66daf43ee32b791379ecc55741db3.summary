ireport.com : more views of @entity2 's compound the lodge is fortified with stone walls at least a foot thick and a guard tower			1
there is a separate facility that resembles a jail on site			0
" there has been a ton of interest since we ran the article , " said @entity57 , vice president of @entity34 in @entity13			1
he added that at least 100 buyers have expressed interest			1
neither @entity40 nor the property owner 's attorney , @entity64 , could be reached by @entity0			2
since bank officials announced a few weeks ago that @entity2 's hideaway was for sale , the news has traveled across the country -- and the world			1
the property holds enormous nostalgic value , @entity57 said			2
after all , he noted , @entity2 's name is closely associated with @entity8 , @entity75			1
" this guy really has incredible fame power , " said @entity76 , senior curator at the @entity77			0
" he became this icon for a whole profession of underworld figures , and people are fascinated with that			0
" with his expensive suits , wide - brimmed fedora and cigar , the gangster who relished the media spotlight became the face of lawlessness during the prohibition era			2
from 1925 to 1931 , @entity2 was @entity8 's most notorious organized - crime boss			1
he ruthlessly relied on intimidation , bribes and violence , according to gangster lore			0
even some state and local law enforcement officers turned a blind eye when @entity2 's gang committed crimes , leaving the feds to chase him , historians say			1
but life as a crime kingpin brought a growing list of enemies , said @entity110 , a professor of criminology at @entity112 , who is also working on a documentary and book about organized crime in @entity8			0
" he wanted to get away from his enemies , " @entity110 explained			0
" he had already escaped death several times			0
" @entity110 said the @entity13 hideout was probably just one of many retreats			1
@entity2 found respite at properties in @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , too			1
the rural locations were ideal because @entity2 's rivals would n't travel that far to hunt him down , @entity110 said			2
no one can say for certain whether @entity2 ever stayed in the @entity13 lodge			1
because he operated an illegal business , there are few written documents with clues on where he spent his time , historians say			2
@entity139 at @entity141 professor emeritus @entity140 , who wrote " @entity2 : a biography " in 2003 , said he has never come across evidence that @entity2 visited the @entity13 hideout			1
@entity146 , vice president of the @entity147 , said there is no hard evidence that @entity2 visited the property , though some locals say they spotted @entity2 in their community			1
more likely , @entity146 said , @entity2 's brother , @entity153 , who was in charge of soda bottling plants , lived on the property at some time			1
" it was a very nice place , " said @entity146 , who visited the property several times when it was open to tourists			0
" there was an open staircase going up to the second floor and a second - floor balcony			0
" the lodge , which the owners claims has the original @entity2 furnishings , was cozy , he recalled			1
the antique furniture captured the wooded @entity13 lifestyle , @entity146 said			2
animal pelts and elk heads decorated the walls			0
if @entity2 did indeed retreat to the @entity20 property , there was plenty of game to hunt , and the lakes are famous for fishing			1
according to historians , the 6 - foot - tall , 200 - pound crime boss enjoyed outdoor sports			2
he was an amateur athlete who began boxing in his adolescence and battled top fighters of the time , including @entity187 and @entity188			0
@entity189 , a professor of history at @entity191 , theorizes that the hideout was a stopover in the transportation of liquor to @entity8 during @entity196			0
it 's rumored among locals that planes from @entity200 that were filled with alcohol docked on the small lake			0
" being an ostensible businessman , he had a lot of channels of supply , " said @entity189 , who points out that the lodge is located close to the @entity200 border			0
@entity2 's illegal activities caught up with him in the 1930s			2
his most infamous mob war , the 1929 @entity212 in @entity8 that killed seven rivals , further enticed federal agents to catch him			0
in 1931 , he was convicted of tax evasion and sent to @entity216 in @entity217			0
this summer , when the hideout tours were shut down , @entity218 , assistant executive director of the @entity219 , said her office received hundreds of calls from disappointed tourists			0
