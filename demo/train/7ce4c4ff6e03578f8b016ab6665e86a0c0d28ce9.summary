-- where would @entity1 be without his agent ? the golfer 's crown as one of the world 's wealthiest and most successful sportsmen may have slipped somewhat , but he knows who helped get him there in the first place			1
when @entity12 departed from @entity13 last month after his contract expired , @entity1 decided to stick with the man he has worked with since 1998 rather than stay with the company that has done more than most to boost golfers ' incomes			0
the move underlined the importance that such " super agents " have in the modern game of golf			0
the focus of the game may always be the battle fought on fairways and greens , but the side of the sport that is away from public gaze is of increasing importance			0
whether it 's navigating the pitfalls of fame , cutting lucrative behind - the - scenes deals with sponsors , managing media appearances or just providing support to an athlete on a long , grueling tour -- agents are crucial to the life of a top golfer			1
if you watch this week 's @entity46 , you will no doubt notice @entity47			1
with his mahogany tan , broad grin and even broader waistline , the 58 - year - old cuts quite a dash on the golf course			1
@entity1 leaves @entity13 , stays loyal to agent at @entity56 in april , it was @entity47 who bear - hugged @entity57 as the @entity58 celebrated @entity60 victory			1
and @entity47 who defended @entity61 after the young @entity63 's challenge imploded on that final day			1
@entity47 's company , @entity64 ( @entity64 ) , represents two of golf 's four reigning major champions , and has four players inside the world 's top 20			1
not much happens in the sport without him knowing about it first			0
" there 's no question @entity77 's a massive influence in golf right now , " @entity74 magazine editor @entity73 said			2
" he could bring down a tournament if his biggest players decided not to play in it			0
potentially , that 's a dangerous amount of power to hold			0
" the rise of @entity64 has coincided with a global power shift in golf			2
five years ago , three of the four major champions were @entity89 , and all three were members of the @entity91			1
today the @entity89 is empty - handed			0
the four majors are held by two @entity58 , in @entity57 and @entity94 @entity46 winner @entity93 , a @entity95 in @entity96 ( @entity97 ) , and an @entity98 in @entity99 ( @entity46 )			1
the @entity91 still have three major holders as members -- in @entity99 , @entity57 and @entity93 -- but with @entity96 , along with @entity47 stars @entity61 and @entity103 's @entity102 , opting to concentrate on the @entity104 instead , the @entity91 lost out on the memberships of two the top three players in the rankings , and three of the top 10			1
new breed of super agents the power base has shifted across the @entity113			0
and from a management perspective , the traditionally all - powerful @entity13 agency has been forced to concede some influence			1
@entity99 is managed by @entity117 in @entity118 , while @entity96 is with @entity119 of @entity121 - based @entity120			0
@entity13 , meanwhile , is without a major winner but it does represent @entity103 's @entity124 -- the latest world no. 1 in succession to @entity127 and @entity96 following the fall of @entity1			2
no wonder @entity47 was smiling when we met at @entity132 's exclusive @entity131 -- dressed in a slick gray suit and open shirt after yet another day of wall - to - wall meetings			1
" you think we 're powerful , do you ... i was hoping nobody noticed that , " @entity47 said			2
" we 've certainly got influence , but i do n't think we use it unfairly			0
i do n't think it 's an unhealthy situation			0
" snubbing the " fifth major " not everybody would agree			0
when @entity61 and @entity102 announced they would skip the @entity91 's flagship event , @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity146 and his players were widely criticized			1
" moving it to the middle of may has made it about the 10th most important tournament in the world , " @entity47 said			2
" it is n't a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a @entity160 event			0
" if this was @entity47 against the @entity91 , then he was n't pulling his punches			2
he wanted the best for his players , and the best meant pulling two of his biggest draws from one of the highest - profile tournaments in the world			0
even if it was n't intentional , it was a quite a power play			0
chubby the fixer @entity47 's evolution to a super agent began in his 15 years as a journeyman professional golfer , where he earned a reputation as a man who sourced cheap flights and did things on a budget			1
it turned out he was a far better fixer than he was a golfer , and when he retired in 1989 , aged just 36 , he set up a management agency to make the most of his talents			2
" my big break was when i got a call from @entity187 to meet him over in @entity118 in 1990 , " @entity47 said			2
" we shook hands on a deal and when i saw him play for the first time i thought , ' wow , this guy can really play , we 've got a proper business now			0
' " @entity194 spread quickly , and a week later @entity47 got a phone call from @entity102 's father , who wanted to show him a video of his son 's swing			1
a cup of tea later , @entity102 joined @entity64 , and the foundations were in place for his empire			1
@entity77 's empire two decades on and @entity64 now looks after the interests of 48 golfers , 20 cricketers , 41 footballers and a @entity211 gold medallist			2
it employs around 30 people and has offices in the @entity94 , @entity215 , @entity58 and @entity145 -- plus a new base recently acquired in @entity217 , @entity218			0
@entity47 's profile has reached such a level that he regularly gets autograph requests at tournaments -- much to the amusement of the likes of @entity102 and @entity187			1
and much as @entity64 is a lot more than the one - man show it began life as in 1989 , it 's hard to imagine its existence without the showman and ringleader who heads up the operation			1
i 'm straight shooter and i 'm blessed with a fair amount of common sense -- which stands me in good stead , " @entity47 said			0
and there speaks arguably the biggest player in golf today .			0
