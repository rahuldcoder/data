@entity0 -- investigators so far have failed to turn up any evidence that terrorism was involved in the september 3 crash of a @entity9 cargo plane in @entity10 , a @entity3 government official told @entity1 tuesday			1
@entity12 counterterrorism chief @entity11 told @entity1 sunday that the @entity3 was " looking very carefully " at that crash -- in which the two pilots were killed -- to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft			1
the @entity17 -- operated by @entity9 -- went down in @entity10 , where one of two toner cartridge bombs was recovered just seven weeks later			2
the other was recovered on a plane in the @entity22 but as investigators in the @entity3 and the @entity25 continue to explore the cause of the crash , they say that at this time , there is no evidence of terrorism			1
government investigators have reviewed the cargo plane 's manifest , a @entity3 government source said			1
the official said that there were " a few -- not many , but a few -- packages ( on the @entity9 plane ) that originated in @entity39			1
" " however , they ( investigators ) have a basic idea of what part of the plane the fire started and these were nowhere near there , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation			0
also , officials in the @entity25 have said -- and a @entity3 official confirmed -- that the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion			1
explosions have distinctive sound signatures , and that would have been recorded on the device , the official said			0
the @entity25 said it has " eliminated the possibility of an onboard explosion , following a detailed onsite investigation of the wreckage			2
" @entity3 authorities are n't going that far , saying only that the investigation is continuing			2
the official noted that a fire caused by an incendiary device , rather than an explosive device , would not have been recorded by the plane 's cockpit voice recorder			2
about 45 minutes after @entity73 departed @entity74 for @entity75 , @entity76 , the crew declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit			0
they requested a return to @entity10 , but shortly before the plane got to the airport , it crashed			0
the cause of the fire is unknown , one official said			0
one thing investigators are looking at is lithium batteries , which are known to have been on the flight			0
even if the lithium batteries were not the source of the fire , they could have made it worse if they were burned .			0

the @entity3 had been looking carefully at the @entity9 crash for terror links
two pilots were killed in the *incident*
there 's no indication of an explosion onboard the plane
