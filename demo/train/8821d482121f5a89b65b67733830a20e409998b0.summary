@entity0 -- an @entity3 pipeline spill that coated streets and lawns with a smelly , asphalt - like crude oil provides opponents of the proposed @entity8 with new ammunition to combat the project that would bring more of the tar sands bitumen from @entity13			1
the @entity15 administration is expected to issue a decision on expanding the @entity8 pipeline in coming months , after an upcoming public hearing that is part of the @entity20 's assessment of the border - crossing proposal			1
the project has become a flashpoint in @entity0 and a dilemma of sorts for president @entity15 , who will anger the liberal @entity26 base if he approves the pipeline or face condemnation from @entity30 and pro-business moderates if he nixes job creation by opposing it			2
a recent report by the @entity20 said the 800 - mile keystone pipeline expansion should have no significant effect on the environment along its proposed route , causing supporters to ratchet up pressure on @entity15 to approve it			1
in saturday 's weekly @entity30 address , rep. @entity41 of @entity42 said the @entity8 pipeline " is primed to give our economy a shot in the arm and make energy more affordable -- and it wo n't cost the taxpayers a dime			1
" @entity41 spoke a day after the apparent pipeline rupture in the @entity3 town of @entity53 , about 20 miles north of @entity54 , that demonstrated the exact kind of environmental threat predicted by opponents of the @entity8 project			1
@entity8 public meeting set black torrents of diluted bitumen -- the tar - like oil dug up in northern @entity63 that is thinned with chemicals to make it transportable by pipeline -- flowed through the community , forcing the evacuation of 22 homes			1
pipeline owner @entity70 was barred tuesday from restarting the pipeline " until the agency is satisfied with repairs and is confident that all immediate safety concerns have been addressed , " according to a statement from the @entity77 @entity79 's @entity78			0
" when i got here , you could have canoed down the street , there was so much oil running down through there , " said @entity53 resident @entity80			0
another resident , @entity87 , described the smell of the black sludge on part of her yard as " very intense			0
" state attorney general @entity92 said tuesday he was launching an investigation and asked @entity70 to preserve all documents and information related to the spill and cleanup efforts			0
@entity99 updates by @entity70 show the scale of the spill designated as " major " by the @entity102 , as well as the struggle to clean it up			0
the company said tuesday it had deployed 15 vacuum trucks , 33 storage tanks and 330 workers that recovered roughly 12,000 barrels of oil and water so far			0
it also mentioned that 14 oiled ducks , two turtles and one muskrat had been found			0
two ducks were killed by the spill			0
to @entity118 , who was in @entity53 on tuesday for the @entity119 , the @entity3 incident portends similar problems with the @entity8 pipeline			1
" we are connecting the two because this is a great example of what could happen if the @entity8 pipeline is permitted and built , " @entity118 told @entity1 , noting it would be transporting the same " viscous , thick , nasty stuff			1
" rep. @entity128 of @entity129 , the top @entity130 on the @entity131 , said the @entity3 incident was " a troubling reminder that oil companies still have not proven that they can safely transport @entity13 tar sands oil across the @entity77 without creating risks to our citizens and our environment			1
" @entity128 has lobbied for legislation ending a tax loophole that protects oil companies from a fee to pay for the costs of tar sands oil spills , and his statement sunday said @entity70 should " be forced to pay for all cleanup costs and assist affected @entity3 homeowners in whatever way they need			2
" " whether it 's the proposed @entity8 , or this mess in @entity3 , @entity77 are realizing that transporting large amounts of this corrosive and polluting fuel is a bad deal for @entity77 taxpayers and for our environment , " he added			2
political tensions over the pipeline run deep			0
protestors call on @entity15 to reject @entity8 pipeline supporters including @entity30 leaders , the business community and some oil state democrats argue it will create at least 5,000 jobs and carry more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day from @entity77 ally @entity13 , reducing @entity77 dependence on less friendly and less stable countries			1
environmentalists and @entity26 allies opposing the project contend the tar sands oil from @entity13 produces up to 30 % more greenhouse gases , and extracting it causes deforestation and other problems			2
however , a traditional political ally on the left -- organized labor -- is generally siding with pro-pipeline arguments because of the jobs it would create			2
the opponents also cite the risk of spills , which they say are more prevalent for the heavier tar sands oil			2
in response , @entity193 premier @entity192 told @entity1 that the tar sand oil from neighboring @entity63 will get to market whether or not the pipeline gets built			1
" this is transitional energy , " @entity192 said			0
" we all want to get to the point where hydrocarbons do n't play the role they play today , but in the meantime , they do			0
" the @entity15 administration initially rejected a permit for the @entity8 pipeline in january 2012 after @entity42 's governor , a @entity30 , complained it would cross the vital @entity208 in his state			1
@entity15 later accelerated approval for a southern portion of the project that runs from @entity213 to the @entity214 , but critics accused him of avoiding a politically sensitive decision on the northern leg			0
@entity42 officials have since approved a revised route for the pipeline , and supporters of the plan now complain that the administration 's continued vetting was unnecessary after previous years of review			2
@entity227 's @entity226 and @entity1 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity15 administration will decide on the @entity8 pipeline this year
opponents argue the tar sand oil from @entity13 makes spills more likely
they cite the @entity3 spill that coated roads and lawns in asphalt - like residue
pipeline supporters say it will create jobs , and the oil will get to market anyway
