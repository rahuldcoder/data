-- for one day a year , a desert outpost in the @entity2 becomes the center of the horse - racing universe			2
the @entity5 is the richest horse race on the planet and features the world 's finest thoroughbreds			2
hosted at the futuristic @entity12 every march , upwards of 60,000 people pack the stands , have a flutter and cheer on the action below			1
the venue is now set to feature at the heart of a much bigger project in the lead up to the @entity21 which will take place in the emirate in 2020			2
the plan is to build a high - end , mini-city around @entity12 , stretching all the way to @entity28 's nearby financial district and the world 's tallest building , the @entity31			1
stage one of this complex process has seen the racecourse transformed into a year - round destination			1
first came the grandstand , a statement construction over one kilometer long that opened in 2010			0
the five - star @entity39 was completed in the same year			2
then followed an @entity42 cinema , school , tennis center , school and golf course			0
" ( in ) 2005 i came here ... there was no thought of @entity51 or developments			0
it was just horse racing , " said former ceo of @entity54 , @entity55			0
" all of a sudden within six months we were building a master plan of a race track and a city and the next thing you know we never stopped moving			0
" with each addition , @entity51 's purpose has extended beyond its equestrian origins			0
stage two is by far the most ambitious element of the project and will feature the development of 1,500 villas over 16 million square meters ( 172 million sq ft )			1
the vast housing site -- named @entity72 after the ruler of @entity28 -- will include parks , lagoons , waterways , jogging tracks , beaches and woodlands			1
the development aims to take the thoroughbred lifestyle @entity51 seeks to embody and recreate it on a massive scale			0
" horse racing and equestrian is the heart and soul of @entity12 , " said @entity83 , chairman of @entity84			1
" that will always be in our pedigree			0
but developing a city ... it puts us on the global map			0
" four to eight bedroom villas here will cost $ 6,200 per square meter ( $ 579 per sq ft ) , that 's more 40 % above the @entity28 average according to real estate consultancy @entity100			1
the next race at @entity12 , it seems , will be finding the well - to - do residents and investors willing to pay these higher rates for the luxury mini-city experience			1
