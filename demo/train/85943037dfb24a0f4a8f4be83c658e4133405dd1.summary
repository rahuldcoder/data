-- just hearing the word " champagne " conjures up images of sparkling wine , popping corks , and wild celebrations			1
but mentioning that other @entity7 -- as in the northeastern region of @entity9 -- evokes a much more complex bouquet			1
filled with wars , political clashes , and controversy , the bubbly region and its eponymous drink have produced a rich history worth toasting to			0
divine origins today , the region synonymous with sparkling wine is crowded with vineyards -- but that was n't always the case			1
in fact , during the 17th century , @entity9 's @entity7 district was known primarily for its high - quality wool			1
then a @entity27 monk named @entity28 came along and changed everything			1
at the age of 29 , @entity28 was appointed business manager of @entity32 at @entity33			1
realizing that the financial health and reputation of the monastery was tied to its vineyards , the @entity28 set to work resurrecting the beaten - down vines and reconstructing the cellar			2
in almost no time , the @entity33 vineyard was up and running			0
nowadays , many people credit @entity28 with inventing champagne by forcing bubbles into sweet wine			1
that 's a myth , though			2
in @entity28 's day , bubbles were considered a serious wine flaw , and the good monk actually went to considerable lengths to eliminate them during his 47 years as cellar - master			1
and while he never succeeded on that front , he did succeed in making bubbly wine a whole lot better			0
for starters , he was the first winemaker in @entity7 to use corks , which kept the carbon dioxide from escaping , thus creating the bubbles			1
he also used a process of gently pressing his grapes , so that it eliminated the dark color that came from the skins -- producing a clearer , less murky wine			0
he even blended his grapes to make a light white wine , which suited the effervescence far better than the heavy red			0
legend has it that upon first tasting his vastly improved beverage , the @entity28 exclaimed , " come quickly , i am tasting the stars ! " loyal @entity69 @entity28 brought such nobility and renown to @entity7 's sparkling wines that they soon became the preferred libation of royalty -- namely , @entity9 's @entity75 , @entity75			1
for much of his life , @entity75 drank champagne almost exclusively -- a habit that made one province very wealthy and another very jealous			1
@entity81 , to the south , felt the @entity75 was giving their fine red wines the shaft			2
they soon engaged @entity7 in a war of words carried out via inflammatory pamphlets and public seminars deriding their wine			1
the feud was no small affair			0
in fact , it lasted for more than 130 years , and many times , the two regions seemed to teeter on the brink of a civil war			0
of course , the @entity99 learned to embrace the long - detested bubbles along the way , and it did n't hurt that doctors began claiming the bubbles cured malaria ( a proclamation that caught the attention of everyone with a moat )			0
@entity109 was hardly the last emperor to take a liking to the region , however			0
at age 9 , @entity113 was sent to study at the @entity116 military academy in @entity7 , where he developed an early interest in the local brew			2
in fact , before each of his military campaigns , the self - appointed emperor made a point of passing through @entity7 to obtain a supply of bubbly from his good friend @entity126			2
after all , @entity113 once claimed of champagne , " in victory you deserve it , in defeat you need it			0
" one can only assume that @entity134 was a time of need			0
sadly , in the ensuing years , @entity7 's ties to royalty did more harm than good			1
in 1870 , @entity113 's nephew , @entity113 , declared war on @entity142 , and by the time @entity144 troops overran @entity146 and @entity147 , the only thing standing between them and @entity150 was a patch of land called @entity7			1
the @entity153 was one of the bloodiest of the 19th century , and many of the deaths , according to one observer , occurred in fields " strewn with fragments of glass from champagne bottles			2
" within a short time , @entity142 had won the war , and @entity9 was left nearly bankrupt			2
it was about that time that @entity164 decided to introduce a radical new idea to the world : dry champagne			0
@entity169 , as it became known , was more expensive and more difficult to make because it required more fully ripened grapes			0
but the extra effort paid dividends			0
the world loved brut , and within three years , @entity9 's economy was back on track			1
along with the cabaret , the cinema , and the cancan , champagne played a large role in the @entity183 -- the nation 's greatest era of peace and prosperity			2
it 's no wonder , then , that the sparkling beverage quickly became a fixed part of @entity9 's national character			1
trick or @entity192 ? in order to cement the @entity99 ' hard - earned contributions to world culture , @entity9 forced some specific language into the 1891 @entity197			2
it stated that sparkling wine could only be named champagne if it was produced in @entity7 and made with grapes originating there			1
as happy as this made the @entity99 , it also created a confusing problem			0
@entity7 itself did n't have defined borders ; thus , when the @entity9 government formally declared in 1908 that only those vineyards in the @entity208 and @entity209 districts had the right to call themselves " @entity7 , " well , it caused quite a ruckus in the neighboring @entity213 region			1
( this would be roughly the same thing as @entity216 suddenly declaring the @entity217 a minor league franchise because it is n't really located in the @entity219 even though they 've won the @entity220			0
) what happened next was predictable : protests , riots and 6 million bottles of good champagne destroyed			0
of course , the incident was nothing compared to the devastation , confusion , and sheer terror @entity7 experienced during @entity231 the @entity233 toll on the area was horrific			2
in fact , the destruction of buildings like the @entity237 ( a building that had seen the coronation of many a @entity9 monarch , celebrated with many bottles of -- what else ? -- champagne ) was so dramatic that among the many stipulations of the post-war @entity245 was a further , more forceful clarification of the 1891 proclamation that only the @entity99 could legally produce a sparkling wine called champagne			1
that seemingly minor concession in the @entity245 has become the linchpin of the business in @entity9			1
the fact that no other nation ( nor any other region of @entity9 , for that matter ) can legally produce champagne gives long - established houses like @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , and @entity262 a huge advantage when it comes to sales			1
sure , other places produce sparkling wine , but in @entity268 it 's called spumante , in @entity270 it 's called cava , and in @entity146 , crémant			1
interestingly , @entity219 sparkling wine producers have been able to get away with printing the word " champagne " on their labels , but only because they 've sneakily skirted the system			1
even though president @entity279 signed the @entity245 , the @entity278 never ratified it ; therefore , @entity219 winemakers are technically not subject to the strict standards of the treaty			2
( which is why @entity284 sells a bottle of " @entity7 " for less than $ 15			2
) champenois of the world today , the champagne business in @entity7 is as strong as ever			1
in fact , things are going so well that some insiders worry that the only place for the region 's industry to go is down			0
they warn that small producers are introducing new brands too quickly , and that they might be at risk of overcrowding the market			0
of course , the biggest problem seems to be growth			0
because @entity7 has a finite geographical size , it can only hold so many vineyards , and right now , the region is at its capacity			2
even though the @entity99 make a wine for the best of times , they 've had more than their share of the worst of times			0
and somehow , that special homemade bubbly always seems to carry them through			0
