-- on october 1 , 1982 , the first commercial compact disc , @entity3 's " @entity2 , " was released in @entity4			1
in the 30 years since , hundreds of billions of cds have been sold , @entity3 has stopped recording pop music and the music industry has moved on to the next hot medium			1
when the first cd player was released that same day , it was described as a " new digital record player , using laser beams " by @entity13			1
spun out of the far less successful @entity15 ' laser disc technology ( remember those ? ) , the @entity10 was a result of @entity15 and @entity17 combining forces			1
the compact disc was actually invented several years earlier			0
the first test cd was @entity23 's " @entity22 , " and the first cd actually pressed at a factory was @entity26 's " @entity25 , " but that disc was n't released commercially until later			1
@entity28 adoption did n't happen immediately -- cds would n't overtake cassette tapes until the late 1980s			1
the first album to sell 1 million copies in the cd format and outsell its vinyl version was @entity36 ' " @entity35 , " released in 1985			1
as with most new technologies , one reason for the slow spread of cds was their steep price tags			2
the @entity42 player sold for the equivalent of $ 730 when it first hit @entity4 shelves in 1982			0
accounting for inflation , that 's about $ 1,750 today			0
the audio cds themselves were $ 15 , which is $ 35 in 2012 dollars			1
because getting a new player and replacing an entire music collection was costly , audio manufacturers were savvy enough to market the first cd players to classical music fans , who were more likely to care about sound quality and have extra disposable income			1
when they arrived , cds were hailed for their pristine sound			0
but whether the audio quality of @entity10 is greater than vinyl remains a hotly debated topic among hi - fi enthusiasts			1
" for most people who were n't audiophiles , the switch to cds was a revolution			1
it took away all the audio noise , " said @entity67 , a music professor at the @entity68 and author of " capturing sound : how technology has changed music			1
" young listeners opting to stream , not own music some will still argue that records sound better than cds , but that is only plausible when people take meticulous care of their albums , listening to them in scratchless , snap - crackle - and - pop - free condition			1
most people do n't consume music in a vacuum			2
even today , the average music fan will listen to tunes on cheap earbuds in an environment filled with background noise , and is likely unable to be able to tell the difference between a cd and an @entity96 , says @entity67			1
the compact disc changed technology , and went on to be used for data and video storage , evolving into re-writeable media and @entity102			0
the shiny little platter also changed how people interacted with their music			0
" changing formats usually has greater impact on the way people listen , consume and disseminate the music , but it also does have an impact on the creative side , " said @entity67			2
the first compact discs could hold up to 74 minutes of music ( the rumor was that the length of @entity117 established that standard ) or at least several songs more than a vinyl lp			2
this longer length allowed composers to write longer works without worrying about side breaks -- where listeners would have to flip over a record or cassette			0
convenience was another huge change			0
the discs were small , just 4.5 inches in diameter , and could be carted around far more easily than records			0
listening to music on a cd was easier -- there was no standing up to flip over the record or tape , less time spent searching for the song you wanted to hear right then			2
some cd players even allowed you to program what songs played or did n't , and in what order			2
three decades later , it may be surprising to some that cd sales , and @entity3 's career , are still alive			1
though their market share is plummeting , cds still account for the majority of album sales in the @entity151 in the first half of 2012 , 61 % of all albums sold were cds , according to the @entity154 and @entity155			0
even so , cds are gradually being overtaken by digital files			0
at first , @entity96 were burned from cds onto computers , traded on peer - to - peer networks such as @entity159 and the @entity161 's back alleys			1
then @entity162 released the @entity163 , and its @entity164 turned digital music files into a legitimate business			2
now popular services like @entity168 and @entity169 let users stream music from anywhere , and @entity173 and @entity162 are encouraging people to store their digital libraries in the cloud			2
like cds before them , this new format is changing both the creation and consumption of music			2
musicians no longer have to wait until an album is finished to release tracks -- they can sell them one at a time			0
length of a song is n't an issue , just file size			0
listeners have more flexibility than ever , with unlimited mix - and - match options			0
and increasingly , they 're opting to download single songs over albums			0
and in an age when computer users can conjure almost any song they want with a few taps or mouse clicks , music stores themselves are disappearing			0
@entity67 does n't think cds and physical music storage will ever vanish altogether			1
people like tangible things , and form meaningful relationships with objects they can hold and look at -- more so than strings of ones and zeros			0
that explains why vinyl sales are up , often among young hipster types who were n't even alive when vinyl was the dominant medium			2
" there is the basic human fact of connection with physical objects , that wo n't change , " said @entity67			0
compact discs are unlikely to evoke the nostalgia many people feel for vinyl records , with their spiraling black groove and sometimes trippy cover art. and to people born in this century , they 're already becoming a retro curiosity			0
streaming debate strikes chord with music fans but a generation of music fans grew up on them -- @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity3 and all .			1

on october 1 , 1982 , @entity3 's " @entity2 " was released commercially on cd
cds would n't overtake cassettes in popularity until the late 1980s
cds remain popular but are *losing* ground to @entity96 and streaming music
whether the audio quality of @entity10 is greater than vinyl remains a hotly debated topic
