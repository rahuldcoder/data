@entity0 -- dr. @entity3 claimed he was giving up a $ 1 - million - a - month medical practice to serve as @entity6 's doctor , a lawyer testified tuesday			1
@entity7 , who negotiated and wrote the contract between @entity9 and @entity3 , was called as a witness in the wrongful death trial of the concert promoter			1
@entity3 , who agreed to work as @entity6 's full - time physician for his comeback concerts for $ 150,000 a month , is serving a prison term for involuntary manslaughter in @entity6 's drug overdose death			2
@entity6 's mother and three children are suing @entity9 , contending the concert promoter was liable in his death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity3			1
drug use explored in trial @entity3 told @entity7 during negotiations that he was closing down four medical clinics that were making $ 1 million each month to take the job , @entity7 testified			1
testimony in @entity3 's criminal trial revealed he only operated two clinics -- one in @entity31 , @entity32 , and the other in @entity34 , @entity35			0
a @entity37 detective testified earlier in this civil trial that @entity3 was more than $ 1 million in debt and that his @entity31 medical clinic faced eviction in the months before he was hired to treat @entity6			1
@entity6 lawyers argue @entity9 executives were negligent because they failed to check @entity3 's background , which they contend would have revealed his debts and misrepresentations about his successful practices			1
@entity6 trial : who is @entity50 ? @entity9 executives testified that they relied on assurances by @entity6 that @entity3 was his " longtime personal doctor , " concluding that he was competent for the tour position			2
a music industry veteran hired as an expert witness by @entity6 lawyers testified earlier that @entity9 's negotiations with @entity3 were " highly inappropriate			2
" the agreement to pay @entity3 $ 150,000 a month set up an " egregious " conflict of interest in which the physician was beholden to the company and himself before @entity6 's interests , @entity62 , who once headed @entity63 and worked for decades as an entertainment lawyer , testified			1
the contractual relationship between @entity9 and @entity3 was " not unlike the team doctor for a football team , where the quarterback is injured and the doctor comes to the medical conclusion that the quarterback should be taken out of the game for a period of weeks , but the team does n't want him out , " @entity65 said			0
" there is an inherent conflict			0
" bad news hurt @entity6 's earning potential @entity65 , called as an expert witness on music industry contracts , also noted that the contract said @entity9 could terminate @entity3 if concerts were postponed or canceled			1
" the fact that if the tour is even just postponed that @entity9 has the ability to cease any further compensation for dr. @entity3 , giving dr. @entity3 even greater conflict of interest since he was in financial dire straits			2
he did need this gig and if it was postponed , which could hypothetically be in the best interest of @entity6 , he ran the risk of losing any further compensation , " he testified			0
@entity65 testified that @entity9 executives should have recognized there could be a problem with @entity3 when he initially asked for $ 5 million for one year as @entity6 's doctor			1
" that is a pretty bizarre amount , " he said			0
the eventual agreement to pay the doctor $ 150,000 a month was still " an exorbitant amount , more than any other person on the tour was paid , " he said			0
" even more of a red flag since @entity9 was aware of another doctor who was willing to take the job for $ 40,000 a month			0
" @entity3 told investigators that he gave @entity6 nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol for two months to treat his insomnia			2
the coroner ruled @entity6 died from a propofol overdose on june 25 , 2009			0
the wrongful death trial , in its 15th week , is expected to continue into september			0
