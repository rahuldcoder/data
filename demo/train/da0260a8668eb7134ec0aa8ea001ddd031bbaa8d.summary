-- celebrity chef @entity1 has tried his hand at a number of things			1
@entity1 's face for television : picking up his @entity7 in 2007			2
@entity9 boarding school taught him that food could be an awful experience ; @entity12 taught him that creativity was more important than money and a stint as a stand - up comedian taught him that you ca n't always get it right			1
half @entity21 , half @entity20 , @entity1 's grandmothers were his first introduction to the variety and pleasure that food can bring			1
while his palate was subdued by the meals he was given at school in @entity9 when he was a boy , his meandering route to becoming a chef came some time after attaining a degree in @entity32 and @entity33			2
moving to @entity34 after graduating he worked on @entity12			1
" you did n't produce anything at the end of a day and you did n't breathe fresh air , you did n't know what the weather was like outside because you were on the floor of the @entity42			0
it 's like the dungeon of capitalism where time and money met , " he told @entity0 's @entity43			0
@entity1 escaped " the dungeon " after a year and a half to the sunny climes of @entity51 , but it was n't to laze around			1
an addiction to high - octane and challenging environments saw @entity1 explore the possibility of being a stand - up comic			1
" i was always afraid to talk in front of the class and now i am trying to make them laugh " he told @entity0			0
" one day you are really funny and then you go to another gig the same night and nobody laughs and then at the same time you are living a life of poverty			0
when you are bombing as a comic i do n't think there can be a worse life			2
" while finding out the hard way how funny , or not , he was , @entity1 was working front - of - house in restaurants , nurturing his love of food			1
his break came when @entity77 from @entity80 restaurant @entity78 took him on as a volunteer in his kitchen			0
" he gave me a job and after one week he said ' ok , you can stay			0
' and then when you work with one really great chef , then i think you can work anywhere , " he said			2
after also training with chefs in @entity89 , @entity1 made his own mark on the culinary world when he opened his first restaurant in @entity93 in 1995 , and at first found the going tough			1
" supplies were not consistent , the language barrier , the taste barrier , the hygiene barriers			0
those are very taxing on a person like me with very little patience			0
" a high - energy chef and now a tv celebrity who presents " @entity103 " -- he won an @entity104 in 2007 -- @entity1 is aware that being flavor of the month on tv is transitory			1
" it is just a machine that feeds on people like me and then spits me out when my time is done			0
you just have to go with the flow			0
