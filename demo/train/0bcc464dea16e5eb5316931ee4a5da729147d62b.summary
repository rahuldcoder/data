-- while following the horrific events at the @entity3 , i was struck by something beyond the tragic developments			1
it was the number of women in law enforcement who were directing the response to those events , and who were center - stage -- at press conferences , in news articles and on my tv screen â € ” as they updated the public			1
they included @entity18 , chief of @entity20 's @entity19 ; @entity21 , assistant director in charge , @entity24 's @entity23 ; @entity25 , chief of the @entity26 and they have largely been the face of officialdom in the @entity3 shootings			1
the gender of these women so prominent in handling the unfolding crisis has gone unmentioned â € ” and this alone is worthy of note , considering the history of women in law enforcement , long a male - dominated profession			1
these women are simply law enforcement leaders doing the jobs they were hired to do			1
and there are more : women also head the @entity41 , the @entity42 , the @entity43 and @entity44			2
this kind of representation is relatively new			0
women have worked in law enforcement since the 19th century			1
but until the 1970s , they were mainly confined to clerical jobs or dispatch			0
affirmative action opened doors , but just a crack			0
women back then still held only 2 % of total police force jobs			2
today , @entity24 figures put the total number of women in law enforcement at around 12 % of the nation 's roughly 700,000 police officers -- with representation highest in big city departments , where females can account for as many as one in four			1
in was n't until 1985 that @entity65 saw a major city swear in its first female police chief , when @entity68 took the job in @entity70 , @entity71			1
since then , the chief has been addressed as " ma'am " in @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and dozens of smaller cities			0
the most recent figures from the @entity83 indicate there are approximately 220 female police chiefs across the country			2
the rise to top leadership positions in law enforcement bumps up against the same barriers as other professions , of course			1
female officers call it the " brass ceiling			1
" ( aka " the bulletproof glass ceiling " )			0
the pioneering chief @entity68 ( who resigned after a rough tenure ) talked about that in an interview in @entity101			0
@entity68 , founder of the @entity102 , said : " unfortunately , the obstacles have not changed much since i started in 1964			0
the culture still values physical strength and devalues reasoning and negotiating skills			0
" she also said that because so many officers start in the military , " they bring those rigid attitudes with them			0
" she added , however , that there are " many wonderful men in law enforcement who are supportive of women , and who are excellent community officers			2
" @entity119 agreed that the march to the top still has pitfalls			0
she told @entity123 last month : " there is a segment of the population that is still watching , waiting and hoping that we do n't do well			0
" still , she cites accomplishments in the 40 years since women were allowed to join men in patrol cars			0
women represent 22 % of the @entity20 police force			1
" women ( officers ) are paying attention to what 's happening in the top ranks			2
... i think , overall , people are starting to appreciate these changes			0
" there is clearly room to improve , but as the women handling the @entity3 crisis so powerfully show , the brass ceiling -- like the glass ceiling -- has begun to crack			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			2

@entity150 : female law - enforcement officials prominent in @entity3 shootings
she says @entity20 police chief , @entity65 park police chief and @entity24 's field office director are all women
she says it 's *remarkable* - - and good -- that little is made of this , given male - dominated field
@entity150 : more women are top - ranked cops today as " brass ceiling " *steadily* cracking
