-- in 2007 and 2008 , the @entity2 economy suffered through its greatest crisis since the @entity4			0
the @entity5 estimates that from 2007 to 2009 , the heart of the @entity8 , more than 8.8 million @entity2 jobs disappeared and more than $ 19 trillion in household wealth was lost			0
in response to the crisis , the federal government took steps to reform our financial system , most significantly , passage of the @entity18 - @entity17			1
signed into law by president @entity21 four years ago monday , this bill was designed to improve accountability and transparency in our financial system , ensuring we never again face a financial crisis of this magnitude			1
regrettably , @entity27 has done little to address the root causes of this crisis			1
instead , by institutionalizing bailouts and undermining a competitive and fair marketplace , this law has joined @entity31 as another example of big government overreach that has ultimately done more harm than good for the @entity2 people			1
@entity37 reform law only half done at 849 pages , @entity27 touches nearly every aspect of our financial system , from capital ratios of large financial institutions down to new rules on the credit cards most @entity2 have in their wallets			1
@entity27 has only grown larger since @entity21 signed it			1
much of the statutory text tasks @entity49 bureaucrats with writing nearly 400 rules			0
as of the first of this month , law firm @entity51 reported 45 % of rulemaking deadlines have been missed			2
since its enactment , @entity27 has imposed $ 21.8 billion in compliance costs while producing regulations that require nearly 60 million hours of paperwork with which to comply , according to estimates by the @entity60 , a center - right policy institute			1
these compliance costs can be devastating to small community banks and credit unions			2
often they are the only financial institutions serving small towns and rural areas such as those throughout my district in western @entity71			0
assuming these small institutions can withstand this @entity27 - induced regulatory onslaught and stay in business , they will join larger banks in passing these added costs along to consumers , driving up the cost of borrowing and reducing access to much - needed credit			1
among the great indignities of the financial crisis : @entity2 families were footing the bill for the massive taxpayer - funded bailouts of @entity88 , @entity89 and other large financial institutions while struggling to scrape by in the broken economy			0
in 2009 , @entity92 estimated that the @entity2 government and other federal agencies had committed nearly $ 13 trillion to support these failing institutions			2
the nearly $ 13 trillion represented 90 % of the @entity2 gross domestic product for 2008			0
in signing the law , @entity21 claimed that never again would the @entity2 people foot the bill for these large firms			2
yet amazingly @entity27 does not just fail to end these bailouts , it cements them into law and greatly increases the likelihood the @entity2 people will be stuck with the federal government 's bailout tab again in the future			1
in addition to an alphabet soup of new agencies , such as @entity112 ( @entity112 ) and @entity5 ( @entity113 ) , @entity27 also gave us the @entity115 , a uniquely ( some might say dangerously ) unaccountable addition to our federal bureaucracy			1
designed with the noble goal of consumer protection , the agency was given significant power to regulate financial offerings but was designed in a manner to leave it free of oversight from both the @entity125 and @entity126			0
among the agency 's " accomplishments " is its qualified mortgage rule that has negatively affected credit availability in the mortgage market			0
the rule has especially harmed those who have typically struggled to access credit in the past , women and minorities			0
a recent report from the @entity138 showed roughly one - third of black and @entity140 borrowers would not qualify for mortgages under the rule			0
even more troubling is the bureau 's latest project , the @entity145			0
in an apparent effort to make the @entity148 jealous , this database will track individual @entity2 and their personally identifiable information , including the most intimate personal and financial details , going back as far as 30 years			2
and this does not even begin to address the consumer agency 's management failures that have led to claims of discrimination and retaliation against minority employees going unpunished and spending $ 216 million to renovate its rented office space			0
put simply , @entity27 is but another failed big government " reform " -- just like @entity31 , the @entity162 , or @entity162 , and the stimulus			1
when will this administration realize more government does not solve problems , it is the problem ? join us on @entity169 / @entity168 .			2

rep. @entity171 : @entity37 reform law is *n't* working four years after enactment
he says @entity27 law has imposed billions in costs and millions of hours of extra work
@entity171 argues it is another example of big government overreach
