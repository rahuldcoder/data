here 's another @entity1 mystery to file alongside the @entity2 and @entity4 's accent in " @entity5			1
these strange frozen saucers were found during a recent cold snap near the @entity9 -- a salmon - filled waterway that passes by the @entity13 @entity12 's summer residence , @entity14 , before heading eastwards to the coastal city of @entity16			2
@entity18 biologist @entity17 made the discovery and took the photos at @entity21 , @entity22 -- several miles downstream of @entity14			0
the trust said it was initially unsure what caused the pancakes , but supects they 're caused by a rare phenomenon in which foam freezes in a swirling eddy			1
rare occurrence " perhaps each disc grew when smaller pieces of unfrozen foam struck the disc , adhered and then froze in place , " it wrote on its website			0
" the raised rims are undoubtedly due to the collisions but what about the inner lines ? " the air temperature was colder at night due to the clear - sky conditions but warmer in the day , meaning the discs may have grown at night , then during the day , when the discs softened in the sun , further collisions between the ' pancakes ' caused the rims to be pushed up			0
" the next night further growth would have occurred , followed by a new rim the next day			0
" the @entity18 said it 's the first time the pancakes , more commonly found in the @entity55 or the @entity56 , have been seen on the @entity9 .			1
