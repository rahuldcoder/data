-- newspaper publishers no doubt long for the days of black - and - white packages on most doorsteps and corporate earnings " in the black , " as they say			0
on monday , @entity10 -- a new king of black and white with its market - leading @entity8 e-reader -- presented them with a chance to earn more profits in the digital world			1
starting december 1 , @entity10 will give newspapers a 70 percent cut of revenue from digital versions of their editions sold in the site 's @entity22			1
that 's in line with what @entity26 and @entity27 give developers selling apps in their digital markets			2
@entity10 announced the changes to reporters monday			2
@entity10 was previously giving newspaper and magazine companies about 30 percent , according to a @entity38 report last year			1
the online retail giant also is providing publishers with a new tool called @entity42 for periodicals			1
the program is designed to speed up the process of producing a version of the newspaper for the many platforms where @entity8 software can be downloaded			1
" a publisher would just need to send one feed , and @entity10 customizes the experience for reading across different apps , " @entity10 spokeswoman @entity50 said			0
if this program is successful , @entity10 could become the leading newsstand of the digital world			1
and if news organizations bite , it could cause a shift in their digital strategies			0
tapping the growing mobile audience has obvious appeal for traditional publishers			0
for example , @entity26 has sold more than 125 million gadgets -- iphones , ipods and the @entity68 -- that run its mobile operating system			0
but finding developers capable of coding software for the system can be difficult and expensive			0
@entity10 wo n't disclose how many @entity73 it has sold , saying only " millions			0
" ( @entity10 chief @entity74 says hiding that number gives the company a strategic advantage on competitors			1
) sure , the @entity8 e-reader still lacks a color display , but its software is available for an array of full - color devices , including the @entity84 , @entity68 and those that run on @entity87 systems			1
the idea is you 'd have access to your newspaper subscription on every @entity8 - enabled device you own			0
it 's certainly been popular among bookworms , but that feature is not yet a reality with newspapers and magazines			0
this same ubiquity strategy has helped @entity100 , a mobile reading application , dominate the digital magazine market , said @entity103 , the company 's chief marketing officer			2
that 10 - year - old business has relationships with 3,000 magazine publishers -- some of which @entity10 is no doubt eyeing for its renewed push into periodicals .			2

@entity10 will give newspapers a 70 percent cut of digital sales for its @entity8 e-reader
if new strategy is successful , @entity10 could become the primary newsstand online
the company also is providing publishers with a tool to *import* pages to other platforms *easily*
