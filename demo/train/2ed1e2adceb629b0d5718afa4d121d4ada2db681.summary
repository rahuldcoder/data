@entity0 , @entity1 -- under almost any circumstance , @entity1 politics are hot and spicy			2
the race for the @entity7 seat this year plays to type , and then some : it 's an almost guaranteed runoff , to be decided in december			1
so the answer to the question of who controls the @entity7 could actually have to wait for @entity1 voters to figure it out			2
the stakes are high , yet the contest is a combination of @entity1 dynasty ( as in incumbent @entity21 sen. @entity20 , whose wobble dance this month is a viral hit ) vs. three term @entity24 congressman @entity23 ( a physician who has focused his message on president @entity27 's record ) vs. conservative tea party candidate @entity28 , a retired @entity29 colonel ( running with the @entity31 seal of approval )			1
@entity24 are fuming at @entity32 , calling him a spoiler because they believe their candidate could have gotten half of the vote if he had disappeared from the race			1
he did n't , and he wo n't			0
we asked him about the accuracy of the term " spoiler " to describe his bid , and he was having none of it			0
" absolutely not , " he responded			0
" there is no taking votes away from so - and - so ... people will go out and vote for who they believe , can best serve us here in @entity1			1
" and so he remains very much in the race			2
a @entity52 / @entity51 this week showed @entity20 and @entity23 almost neck and neck , at 36 % - 35 %			1
@entity28 , meantime , is at 11 %			1
so the top two finishers will face off in a run - off on dec. 6			0
" we call it a jungle primary system because we just let all the candidates get into one room , so to speak , and just go at it and see who makes the runoff , " said @entity57 , publisher of @entity59			2
democrats and @entity24 are already into the runoff mode , with more than $ 10 million reserved on tv for the next phase			1
expect that to grow if , in fact , control of the @entity7 comes down to @entity1			0
but @entity1 might not be the only cliffhanger			0
in @entity76 , a libertarian could force the @entity7 race there to a run - off in january -- a month later than @entity1 's december date			1
as for @entity28 , he 's not letting the establishment talk him out of anything			1
" the party , it 's about power , you know , " @entity28 told @entity2			1
" well , the back room got together and decided that so and so 's gon na be the guy or gal. " he said he 's gotten calls urging him not to run -- which he resisted			2
his campaign got a splash — literally — as he " wrestled " an alligator , sort of			0
he does that in an ad in which he said " here in @entity1 you learn to be tough			2
one moment of weakness , and the alligators can eat you alive ... @entity1 needs a senator that will stand up to the career politicians and the alligators			0
" " some said it was a stunt			0
but it was a very good way to communicate effectively visually with the people of @entity1 , " @entity28 told @entity2 in an interview			1
it did get him noticed , and @entity31 has been to @entity1			0
several times to campaign for him and help raise money			0
in @entity1 — which is also hosting the comeback campaign of ex gov @entity110 , a @entity111 , now running for a @entity113 seat , and @entity114 rep. @entity114 , an incumbent running for re-election after being caught on a surveillance camera kissing a married female staffer — the @entity7 race is par for the course			1
and maybe even a little bland			0
at least according to @entity120 , owner and chef of the @entity0 restaurant @entity124 whose family has been in @entity1 for five generations			0
" you can fly your freak flag here in @entity0			0
you can be a lot more liberal ... you can have a purple @entity132 and have your teeth painted black and someone next to you is gon na be twice as crazy " @entity120 said as he prepared some @entity130 fare			0
" in north @entity1 , it can be very conservative , and that 's the way they roll ... our politics are lively and unique			2
" correction : an earlier version of this story misstated @entity28 ' first name and party affiliation			1
he is a @entity24 .			1

@entity21 sen. @entity20 is in a tough *reelection* *battle* for her seat
@entity20 's @entity24 *opponent* is @entity150 rep. @entity23
there 's also another @entity154 candidate @entity28 who 's getting 11 % of the vote
the race will likely go to a runoff in december
