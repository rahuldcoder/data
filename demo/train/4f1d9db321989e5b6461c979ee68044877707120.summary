-- would the " first conservative " recognize modern conservatism ? the conservatism of recent days has been a conservatism of radical individualism : a politics that sees its job as protecting society 's " makers " from society 's " takers			1
" yet the man most often credited as the founder of modern conservatism , the 18th - century @entity12 thinker - politician @entity11 , saw things very differently			1
against the politics of " i want , i want , i want , " he emphasized continuity , responsibility and community			1
that was a tough teaching 200 years ago , and it remains a tough teaching today			0
it 's not a surprise that it often goes unheard			0
this year , however , @entity11 's tough teaching is again getting the articulation it deserves , thanks to two distinguished books by two rising conservative thinkers , one @entity12 , one @entity31			1
@entity32 is a @entity12 member of @entity33 who strongly identified with prime minister @entity35 's modernizing conservatism			1
his book was first published in @entity37 under the title " @entity11 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 " but then rereleased in the @entity31 under the pithier " @entity11 : the @entity42			1
" as @entity32 tells it , @entity11 was a thinker and politician who rejected the demands of " i want " in favor of the duties of " you should			1
" in @entity11 's words : " [ t ] he state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee , calico or tobacco , or some other such low concern , to be taken up for a little temporary interest , and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties			1
" @entity11 rejected both the " i want , i want " of people who expect ever more generous social programs from government -- and the " i want , i want " of bankers and brokers who wish to be allowed to stake huge gambles with other people 's money			1
" except in reaction to the most extreme necessity , [ @entity11 's ] politics is one of moderation			1
he was an early supporter of free markets , but only within a strong context of personal probity , law , market norms and trust			0
" @entity32 's @entity11 forcefully critiques the disintegration of society into personal atoms , each seeking only its own personal economic betterment			1
" [ @entity89 ] he individual is not simply a compendium of wants , human happiness is not simply a matter of satisfying individual wants , and the purpose of politics is not to satisfy the interests of people living here and now : it is to preserve an evolving social order which meets the needs of generations past , present , and future			0
" make no mistake : @entity32 's @entity11 politics is conservative politics			1
@entity11 defended free enterprise and private property rights			2
@entity11 's contemporary @entity108 , author of " @entity109 " and founder of modern economics , saluted @entity11 as the only person whose ideas had corresponded with his own without any prior communication between the two			1
@entity11 favorably reviewed @entity108 's books , and the two men became friends			1
yet @entity11 could also forcefully denounce the abuse of economic power and the corruptions of wealth			2
@entity32 again : " [ @entity122 ] e regarded as his greatest achievement his campaign to restrain the influence , greed and self - dealing of the @entity128 , and to insist on the accountability of private power to legitimate public authority			0
" here is a conservative who has much to say in the era of predatory finance and selective bailouts			0
a politician himself , @entity32 shrewdly appreciates that @entity11 's contributions emerged from an active career			1
@entity11 understood the limits of the possible because he himself had often bumped up against them -- hard			2
@entity11 spent only a few months of his long political career in office ; he passed most of his parliamentary career estranged from the government of the day and exerted almost all of his influence in writings and speeches from the back benches			2
@entity32 bumped up one of those limits himself			0
in september , he voted against his own party leadership on a proposed intervention in the @entity159 civil war and was stripped of his party leadership position			0
in politics , yet separated from it -- that is the place and role to stimulate fresh political thought			0
the author of this year 's second great work on @entity11 , @entity168 , is located both closer to -- and simultaneously further from -- political power even than @entity32			1
a former domestic policy adviser to president @entity171 , @entity168 now edits the flagship conservative policy magazine , @entity172			0
at the same time , he is one of the most influential advisers of rep. @entity174 , the former @entity175 vice presidential nominee ; you might say that @entity168 now holds the @entity178 chair as a one - man @entity175 brain trust			0
@entity168 presents his new work on @entity11 as a study of a fierce debate that erupted in the 1790s between @entity11 and his one - time friendly acquaintance , @entity185			2
both men were migrants : @entity11 , @entity187 - born , had moved to @entity188 ; @entity185 , @entity188 - born , moved to the @entity189			2
@entity185 had given words to the @entity191 in his pamphlet " @entity193 , " which became , after the @entity195 , probably the most widely read book in the @entity31 of the 1770s			2
@entity11 had urged compromise with the @entity31 in speeches in @entity33 and then , after it was too late for reconciliation , urged peace and acceptance of independence			1
fifteen years later , however , those two former allies bitterly quarreled			0
@entity11 's 1790 book , " @entity206 , " eloquently and prophetically warned that revolution would end in blood and tyranny			1
@entity185 wrote a rebuttal to @entity11 , " @entity211 , " published in 1791			2
he transplanted himself to @entity212 to lend personal support to the new regime and was elected to the @entity215			0
to his surprise -- but probably not to @entity11 's -- @entity185 ended up in a @entity212 prison cell when his preferred faction lost power in late 1793			1
but he was not guillotined , and he lived and kept writing , becoming probably the first writer in @entity188 to propose something prophetically like the modern welfare state			0
in " @entity224 : @entity11 , @entity185 , and the @entity229 , " published in december , @entity168 argues that @entity185 deserves equal billing with @entity11 as a founder of our modern political debates			2
@entity168 sets each thinker as a standard and corrective for their modern descendants			0
yet as @entity168 himself seems well aware , it is the conservatives who have drifted further -- and who need correction more			0
@entity168 's @entity11 often seems to be debating -- not against his contemporary @entity185 -- but against our contemporaries of the libertarian right			1
" @entity11 essentially denies the relevance ( though not necessarily the existence ) of abstract , individual , natural rights			2
he defines instead some practical rights to the benefit of society			0
and those benefits do not amount to freedom or power			0
in fact , some of the benefits of society to which men have a right involve restraints on their freedom and their passions			0
" and again : " human beings can not live in society if they follow their wants and passions unrestrained , and so one of the rights of citizens is to have their passions brought under some control			0
thus society guarantees some liberties and some restraints , and precisely how these are balanced is in normal times a matter of prudence , not absolute principle			0
" and once more , this time maybe most tellingly : " where @entity185 imposes on government the obligation to respect the freedom of action of each of its citizens , @entity11 imposes on government a much less exacting ( if somewhat more demanding ) obligation to meet the wants of the people and advance the interests of the complex social whole			0
" it is @entity185 , @entity168 's non-hero , who speaks the language of the tea party -- and @entity11 , @entity168 's hero , who rejects maximum individual rights in favor of a theory of social obligation			2
@entity11 sees , and @entity168 sees with him , that a politics of egoism and individualism leads to the dissolution of the institutions a conservative will want to protect			1
as @entity168 concludes : " today 's conservatives are thus too rhetorically strident and far too open to the siren song of hyper individualism			1
... they could benefit by adopting @entity11 's focus on the social character of man [ and ] from @entity11 's thoroughgoing gradualism			1
" these are wise and needed cautions -- and phrased with the cautious wisdom necessary to make them acceptable to conservatives who do not wish to hear what they most need to know			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity318 .			0

@entity12 thinker @entity11 often considered the " first conservative , " @entity318 says
yet @entity11 would differ from the radical individualism of today 's @entity31 conservatives , he says
@entity318 says @entity11 saw the *importance* of community , continuity and responsibility
@entity330 : two new books show the need for taking @entity11 's philosophy seriously today
