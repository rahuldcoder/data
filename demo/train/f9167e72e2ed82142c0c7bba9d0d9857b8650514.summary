-- it is one of the most iconic ports in the world , the dramatic backdrop to everything from ancient @entity11 sailing ships to @entity7 military vessels and gas - guzzling speedboats			0
now @entity13 's historic @entity12 has played host to a new generation of boat -- one which could revolutionize not just the future of nautical design , but scientific research on the high seas			1
introducing @entity22 -- the world 's largest solar - powered boat			1
@entity26 disposition resembling more " @entity28 " than a modern catamaran , the 35 - meter vessel arrived in the @entity31 capital last week -- its last stop on a scientific expedition across the @entity34			1
featuring an expandable deck covered in over 500 square meters of solar panels , the 60 - ton vessel is completely powered by the sun. more than 800 solar panels charge enormous lithium - ion batteries stowed in the catamaran 's twin hulls , which power two electric motors at the back			1
" on a full battery we can run for 72 hours without sun , " says captain @entity46 , who is also the first man to row solo across the @entity34 and the @entity48 oceans			0
" i receive meteorological forecasts for the next week , which update on our map every hour , so i can see the sunniest route to take			0
" @entity57 expedition the $ 16 million vessel cut an impressive figure as it cruised beneath @entity13 's raised @entity60 , marking the end of an almost three - month scientific expedition along the @entity34 's warm @entity63			1
heading off from @entity67 in june , the boat 's team of scientists examined water and air samples , as part of their research into climate change			1
led by @entity75 climatologist @entity74 -- a member of a @entity78 - backed panel on climate change that won the 2007 @entity80 -- they used high - tech " vacuum cleaners " to measure aerosols ( fine particles in the air ) and winches which plunged 200 meters below the water			1
watch : stunning time - lapse of @entity89 science mission " the fact that the boat does n't create any pollutants means what we measure is as natural as possible , " said @entity74			0
" and in terms of awareness - raising , we 're carrying out the research in a boat which could be connected to the future and reducing our carbon footprint			0
" record breaking design it 's not the first time the high - tech vessel has made headlines around the world			2
in may last year it also became the first solar - powered vessel to circumnavigate the globe , traveling at an average speed of five knots			1
it continued to break the record books earlier this year when it made the fastest solar - powered crossing of the @entity34 -- traveling from @entity116 to the @entity117 in 22 days and breaking its own previous record by four days			1
see : high - tech yacht aiming to smash speed record the brainchild of @entity123 eco-adventurer @entity122 , the high - tech boat was designed by @entity126 nautical architecture company @entity125 , and built by @entity129 shipyard @entity127 in 2010			2
and with room for up to 60 people , you 're more likely to see the unusual boat before you hear it			0
unlike other diesel - powered ships , @entity22 glides silently across the water			2
" the boat has a very special look , with her expandable deck , " said @entity46			0
" in fact , we were two miles off the coast of @entity142 when some people called the police to say there was an airplane on the water			0
" old name , new look but for such a futuristic - looking vessel , @entity22 has an ancient - sounding name			2
" @entity156 " was named after the word for " power of the sun " in @entity154 's " @entity153 " trilogy			0
it may also prove to be the beginnings of an epic adventure -- this time on the high seas .			0
