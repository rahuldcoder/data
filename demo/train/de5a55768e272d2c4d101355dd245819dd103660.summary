@entity0 -- with his presidency at a crossroads , president @entity2 delivered his health care " fix it " message with a healthy dose of reflection and contrition : " i think i said early on when i was running , i am not a perfect man and i will not be a perfect president			1
" @entity13 : @entity2 offers fix for canceled plans at the moment , the challenge is to get back to being a productive president , and those who see a difficult path ahead include veteran @entity20 the president counts among his most trusted friends and allies			1
" can @entity2 come back ? " a veteran @entity25 strategist asked			1
but like @entity28 and ( @entity29 ) @entity29 , his downfall is his handling of the job			2
" this party sage framed the stakes this way : " the next few months will tell us whether he will be remembered in the pantheon of successful / consequential presidents in the last 60 years or whether he will be a flawed president whose skills did not match the times			0
" after the president 's lengthy appearance in the @entity44 briefing room thursday , @entity40 were scathing in making the case it was too little too late and proof , to them , @entity49 was collapsing			1
predictable , but an argument that has more weight now is that the president , using his terms , " fumbled " the rollout of his signature domestic initiative			0
at an @entity58 event later thursday , the president promised to vigorously fight any effort to " gut " the law , and as that debate continues , it is the mood among his fellow @entity20 that is most important			0
@entity2 : ' i 'm going to see this through ' initial reaction was hardly reassuring to the @entity44			1
@entity20 in both the @entity44 and @entity68 mixed praise of the president 's intentions with promises to not trust the administration to fix the problems without guidance from @entity75			1
@entity77 leaders holding off on legislative ' fix ' for insurance promise this is the new political reality : the president himself acknowledged the rollout was hurting his party 's standing heading into the 2014 midterm election season			2
while he promised to work hard to turn the political tide , @entity20 hoping to be in @entity0 beyond the end of 2016 -- meaning beyond the @entity2 years -- will be less and less reluctant with each passing day to trust their fate to his plans and instincts			1
especially because of those polls the president suggested he does n't read			0
for @entity20 , especially given the timing , the numbers are numbing : whether you look at the low @entity49 enrollment figures or president @entity2 's declining poll standing , what you see is a @entity44 -- and a presidency -- at a crossroads , facing persistent questions about credibility and competence			1
@entity110 : how could @entity2 not have known ? the question now consuming @entity0 is whether this is just a temporary bad turn or a tipping point			1
in a more sympathetic take , a senior veteran of both @entity2 presidential campaigns and the first @entity44 term put it this way : " i feel for him and my old colleagues			1
tough when you 're in the penalty box			0
" that view assumes the penalty clock expires , and the president rallies			0
@entity40 missteps in the past -- like the government shutdown -- give many @entity20 hope the president 's critics will overreach again and create an opening for a rebound			2
poll : approval of health care law drops less sympathetic , though , was another seasoned @entity136 , this one a veteran of the @entity138			2
" they do n't have the time , or the self - awareness , " to objectively study and learn from recent mistakes , this longtime @entity25 operative said of the president and his second - term team			2
" what they do not appreciate is how far away they are from the end of the second term			0
we had not even had ( @entity156 ) @entity155 yet at this point , " the operative said , referring to @entity152 's @entity44 affair with an intern			1
noting the sagging poll numbers and increasing public complaints from the president 's fellow @entity20 , this source , speaking only on condition of anonymity , predicted a rough stretch ahead : " there will be a ton of stories about the need for new and fresh staff and how @entity2 needs to open his circle up to people who he does not know , or at least not well			1
" new polls showing the president at new lows in several categories are only increasing a case of @entity25 jitters that began once it was clear the @entity49 rollout was going poorly , and that any political advantage democrats gained from the government shutdown was fading			2
@entity49 promises : where things stand the latest @entity185 poll found just 39 % of @entity186 approve of how the president is handling his job ; 54 % disapprove			0
those numbers are similar to president @entity29 's standing at this point in his second term			1
in an especially troubling turn , that same survey found -- even though congressional approval ratings are at an all time low -- voters trust @entity40 in @entity75 as much or more than the president on big issues like health care and the economy			0
in the past , the president 's strong personal standing with voters has helped him through stretches when voters question his job performance			0
but there are signs he can not , at least at this delicate moment , count on that traditional safety net			0
the @entity185 poll , for example , found for the first time more voters say the @entity215 is not trustworthy			0
the timing is what makes this rut even more complicated -- and potentially consequential -- for the president and his second term			2
every day brings the 2014 midterm elections closer , and with the president 's standing low , loyalty within his own party becomes harder to maintain			1
@entity44 @entity20 cool down after @entity49 meeting evidence of that is abundant , from the @entity20 pushing for @entity49 changes , to meetings between congressional @entity20 and @entity44 officials this week that turned testy as lawmakers aired their complains about the @entity49 rollout and how it was hurting the party politically			2
in @entity2 's 2008 campaign , he ran as much against the struggling @entity29 administration as he did against the @entity40 nominee			1
back then , questions about the @entity240 war and the federal response to @entity242 had put front and center the questions president @entity2 now faces -- about credibility and competence			1
@entity248 : @entity49 " a rolling calamity " " there is a very tender and important period for the president , " said the veteran @entity25 strategist			2
instead of a @entity242 analogy , this @entity136 looked for a parallel within his own party -- the @entity28 presidency			0
" health care could become his energy shortage , " the strategist said			0
health care reform was the signature initiative and achievement of the president 's first term , yet the continuing debate over the program , and the administration 's rollout , is now holding his second term agenda hostage			0
a look back at the @entity271 from the beginning of this year is a reminder that the president has realized nothing from his wish list , which included news jobs programs , an increase in the minimum wage and major immigration reforms			0
getting things done in the second year -- the midterm election year in which @entity49 is certain to be the central issue -- would be difficult even if the president found a path to improve his political standing			0
especially if @entity20 lose faith in the @entity44 as @entity40 did with @entity29 and his team			1
@entity290 talks about ' vindication ' with rocky @entity49 rollout @entity2 : @entity293 needs more than technical fixes			0

administration facing persistent questions about credibility , competence
@entity25 veteran questions whether @entity44 learns from mistakes
@entity2 's poll numbers at same place as @entity29 's at this point in his presidency
timing of crisis is key -- every day brings midterm elections closer , loyalty harder to maintain
