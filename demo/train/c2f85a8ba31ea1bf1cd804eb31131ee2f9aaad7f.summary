-- after sushi and ramen , @entity2 beef is on the list of must - eats for many visitors to @entity2			1
but other than knowing that it tastes great and costs a lot , many tourists turn up with little knowledge of what to expect from @entity2 beef			1
considered the caviar of beef in @entity2 , @entity15 ( which literally means " @entity2 cow " ) refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct , traceable and pure bloodline			1
there are four @entity15 breeds : black ( accounting for more than 90 % of @entity25 beef ) , brown / red , shorthorn and polled			1
in recent years , efficient marketing efforts have elevated @entity15 to near - divine status among foodies			2
but they 've also led to confusion about what @entity15 is and what separates @entity25 beef from the even - more heralded @entity34 beef			1
here 's help for beef eaters visiting @entity2			1
what is @entity25 beef ? for more than 200 years during the @entity40 ( 1603 - 1867 ) , @entity2 's isolation from the outside world ensured the purity of its livestock , which over time became more and more homogenized			1
when the country opened to world trade in the subsequent @entity47 , @entity25 breeding accelerated			2
unlike cattle in other countries , which are often bred for a range of traits , @entity15 were and are raised with one goal in mind : supreme flavor			2
" genetics is everything , " says @entity55 , owner of @entity56 , a @entity58 - based meat importing business			0
@entity15 's striking characteristic is its pervasive marbling			1
achieving optimum and evenly distributed fat is a slow process			0
@entity15 are typically bred for upward of 30 months			2
by contrast , most @entity67 ( @entity67 ) beef comes from cattle that 's about 22 months old			0
the fattening period is longer than it is on most @entity72 ranches			0
wagyu cows eat plentifully and frequently			0
@entity2 's lack of vast pastures means @entity15 tend to live a sedentary life , which also contributes to generous marbling			1
wagyu grades @entity2 has a sophisticated numbering system for tracing each piece of beef produced			1
the @entity82 ( @entity83 ) maintains records on each cow 's ancestry , birthplace , ranch location , fattening days and other details			0
restaurants can usually provide a 10 - digit tracking number for any steak upon request , which has a code that links directly to the @entity83 database			0
in addition , the @entity95 gives each carcass a score based on its yield ( @entity100 ) and level of marbling , firmness , color and overall quality ( 1 - 5 ) , with @entity106 being the highest possible mark			0
most @entity2 @entity25 beef is in the @entity106 range			1
wagyu yields and pricing all the care that goes into raising @entity15 cows translates into consumer prices that are typically higher than in many @entity72 countries			1
visitors to @entity2 should expect to pay anywhere from Â ¥ 5,000 ( $ 46 ) to upward of Â ¥ 15,000 ( $ 138 ) per person for a meal of authentic @entity25 beef			1
at the @entity125 at the @entity126 , meat designated @entity121 ( a mix of two pure breeds , such as @entity15 and @entity124 ) is more popular than pure @entity25 beef because it 's cheaper yet still yields good quality			1
" @entity132 is considered an investment , " says @entity130 , chef de cuisine at @entity131			0
" @entity121 is the most - consumed beef in @entity2			2
" for most families , @entity25 beef is a delicacy reserved for special occasions			1
" wagyu cows have a high yield of prime cuts			0
" in the @entity142 , you can only use three of four cuts for steaks , whereas in @entity2 you can get high - quality beef from nearly all parts of the cow , " says @entity55			1
the emphasis is on quality , not quantity			0
@entity83 figures put the total @entity25 population at around 1.7 million cows as of december 2012 , compared with roughly 33 million beef cattle in the @entity142			2
how to eat @entity25 beef most chefs recommend @entity15 steaks be cooked a little longer than those from @entity72 countries -- medium - rare or even medium			1
otherwise , " they can be like eating a stick of butter , " says @entity130			0
steaks are n't the only way to enjoy @entity15			2
traditional preparation methods include sukiyaki and shabu - shabu , one - pot dishes that render out more of the fat than grilling			0
@entity168 simmers thinly sliced beef in a pot with vegetables , usually bathed in a sauce made with soy sauce , sugar and sake			0
a raw egg is served with the dish , used for dipping the beef after it 's extracted from the broth			0
@entity180 is a light and healthy meal made with strips of meat even thinner than those used for sukiyaki			0
the beef strips are briefly cooked in a simmering kombu kelp broth			0
finally , there 's beef tartar or " nigiri @entity15 sushi , " though this is a relatively rare preparation in @entity2			1
no matter how it 's prepared , virtually all restaurants in @entity2 have a signature dipping sauce or sauces , which often contain miso , sesame or citrus juice			2
wagyu beef myth : @entity200 means unhealthy health - conscious eaters may be wary of the web of fat ( called " shimofuri " ) woven through slabs of @entity25			1
however , pure @entity132 contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids ( aka " the good fats " ) rich in @entity207			0
one study from the @entity209 says @entity15 has up to 30 % more unsaturated fat than @entity124 cattle			2
you may have heard about the fifth " primary taste " on top of sweet , sour , salty and bitter : umami , a term and concept that originated in @entity2 , which describes a subtle sweetness and aroma			2
the presence of unsaturated fats is what makes @entity15 beef so full of umami goodness			2
wagyu cows are rarely , if ever , given antibiotics			0
one of the primary purposes of administering antibiotics , says @entity55 , is to make an animal more feed - efficient			0
this philosophy runs counter to the goal of @entity25 ranching , which is to raise fat , hungry cattle			2
myth 2 : @entity2 cows drink beer and get massages while it 's true that the @entity240 's website advocates using beer to stimulate a cow 's appetite in humid summer months and massages for uniformity of fat and improved circulation , it cites no actual case studies			2
at best , these techniques may be used sporadically by small - scale farms			0
some ranches may use sake to enhance the luster of an animal 's coat and @entity2 tv programs have depicted ranches with prongs in cattle pens that animals rub up against to simulate a massage			2
while it 's amusing to entertain notions of @entity25 cows happily guzzling beer while receiving rubdowns , there 's no evidence to suggest such practices have ever been commonplace			0
the @entity270 states that neither massages nor the feeding of beer or sake to cows is part of its standard rearing methods			0
" how 's he going to feel a massage through his leather jacket , anyway ? " asks @entity55			0
myth 3 : wagyu beef and @entity34 beef are the same thing a common misperception is that all @entity15 beef is @entity34 beef			1
in fact , only .06 % of beef consumed in @entity2 bears the @entity34 distinction , and only 3,000 cattle each year are certified as @entity34 grade			1
it was n't until february 2012 that the first @entity34 beef shipment was sent outside @entity2 -- to @entity293			1
the first ( small ) export to the @entity142 was in november 2012			0
wagyu beef types are named for the region in which the cattle are raised , including , confusingly , @entity34			1
for the impressive level of marbling in its @entity25 beef , the @entity298 produces the three " king " varieties : @entity303 , @entity34 and @entity304			1
however , beef from other areas can be equally tasty , says @entity307			0
@entity15 , for example , comes from the rare @entity2 brown breed and is a good choice for those seeking a leaner cut			1
although many ranching outfits in @entity315 and the @entity142 are now raising @entity25 crossbreeds , only four facilities in @entity2 are certified to export @entity15 beef to the @entity142			1
so , the easiest and tastiest place to get authentic @entity25 beef remains @entity2			1
just one more reason to visit			0
