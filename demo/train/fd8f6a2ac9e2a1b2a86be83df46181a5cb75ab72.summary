@entity0 is a professor at the @entity1 and is actively supporting the campaign of sen. @entity3			1
@entity0 : media 's features on african - american women voters are missing the point			1
( @entity8 ) -- you ca n't turn on a 24 - hour news channel or your nightly news this week without seeing a feature on african - american women voters			2
it makes sense , being that the @entity19 @entity18 primary is only one day away and @entity21 - @entity21 women will make up approximately one - third of the voters			1
the angle in these news features is virtually identical			0
the commentators wonder and marvel at the extraordinarily difficult choice for @entity21 - @entity21 women in this primary -- will we vote for the woman candidate or the @entity21 - @entity21 candidate ? reporters have been busying themselves traveling to crowded beauty shops all over the state to answer this question			1
the funniest , or perhaps most disturbing , thing about these stories is how far they are from my reality			0
i am an @entity21 - @entity21 woman living in @entity19			1
i have @entity21 - @entity21 women family members and friends who live in this state			1
i actually visit beauty shops to get my hair done			0
never once have i heard a single woman i know frame the choice about whom to vote for as a question of gender or racial politics			2
so what are @entity21 - @entity21 women talking about when the cameras are n't watching or , more importantly , what are we telling the media that is not being fairly reported ? @entity21 - @entity21 women are talking about the issues ! we talk about the vision that each candidate has for leading this country			1
we enthusiastically discuss the possibility that real , positive change will come from this election			0
we even parse the policy distinctions in the candidates ' positions on education , creating jobs and ending the war in @entity70			0
sometimes , the issues we talk about do deal with aspects of gender and racial identity			2
we debated sen. @entity76 's statement implying that @entity78 's civil rights movement did not fulfill its promise until @entity80 signed the @entity81			0
we argue and marvel at the significant generational divide in the @entity21 - @entity21 community that is being exposed by this election process			1
if you listen closely to the women in the news features at the beauty shops , they are commenting on these issues , even when the voice - over in the same feature is telling you that the women are discussing whether it 's more important to have the first woman or the first black president			1
why is the media determined to make us choose ? why do they insist that we declare our loyalty to either women or to african - americans ? this is a truly false dichotomy in that we are the living , breathing embodiment of both identities			2
asking us to prefer our gender over our race ( or vice versa ) is the equivalent of asking us to prefer one vital organ over another			2
that is not to say that identity politics are completely irrelevant in this election			0
@entity21 - @entity21 women are expressing their pride in both candidates and in the progress this country has made that allows a white woman and an @entity21 man to be strong contenders for the presidency			1
my mother is uplifted by the idea that @entity3 's candidacy means that her two grandsons will grow up being able to realistically dream about being president			0
on saturday , we will carry this pride into the voting booth with us , but when we cast our votes , we will be thinking about the serious issues facing this country			0
that 's the truth , and do n't let the media tell you otherwise			0

@entity0 : race - or - gender choice is driven by media , not reality
