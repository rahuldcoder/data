@entity2 balked as the former class president handed her a name tag			1
on it was @entity13 's senior photo			2
walking around the event , something inside of her snapped			2
" i 'm wearing a picture of me 10 years younger and 100 pounds lighter , " @entity2 remembers			1

" @entity2 did n't grow up overweight , though she sometimes felt like it in her athletic family			1
her parents cooked healthy meals around the house , and @entity13 swam , played tennis and ran cross country until she left for college			2
at the @entity38 in @entity39 , where she majored in communication arts ( otherwise known as comic books and poetry , she jokes ) , she ate whatever she wanted			0

she read about serving sizes and started using an app to count calories			0
she even bought a food scale			0

" at 255 pounds , you do n't actually want to do anything			2
