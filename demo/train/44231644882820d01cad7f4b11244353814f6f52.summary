on sunday , @entity0 and @entity1 , a married couple , allegedly killed two police officers in an ambush at a @entity5 pizza restaurant and then murdered another person in an adjacent @entity7			1
during the attack , the couple reportedly stated that their attack was part of a " revolution , " according to second assistant sheriff @entity13			0
the @entity14 appear to have been motivated by extreme far - right views			1
the couple left a flag at the scene of the crime with the words " @entity24 , " a @entity22 symbol used by some anti-government extremists			1
they also left a swastika at the scene , though @entity13 cautioned to reporters , " we do n't necessary believe that they are white supremacists or associated with the @entity31 movement			0
we believe that they equate government and law enforcement ... with @entity35			0
" @entity13 added an assessment of the @entity14 ' ideological roots saying , " there is no doubt that the suspects have some apparent ideology that 's along the lines of militia and white supremacists			2
" @entity13 also confirmed that @entity45 had written on his @entity47 page that he had been ejected from the @entity48 , the @entity49 site where armed ranchers as well some with anti-government militia ties held off federal officials at gunpoint in april			2
however , @entity13 was not able to confirm @entity1 's actual presence at the ranch			2
( @entity48 's son @entity56 said that " state militia members " told him the @entity14 had been at the ranch , but were asked by a militia member to leave because of " their radical beliefs			2
" ) the attack in @entity5 is far from the only incident of violence by the @entity65 far right			1
according to data collected by the @entity68 , right - wing extremists have killed 37 people in 16 violent incidents , in the @entity65 since the 9/11 attacks			1
that number is more than the 21 people killed by militants motivated by @entity76 's ideology in the @entity65 in the post- 9/11 era			1
although a variety of left wing militants and environmental extremists have carried out violent attacks for political reasons against property and individuals since 9/11 , none have been linked to a lethal attack			1
as we pointed out in this space less than two months ago , a man shot and killed a 14 - year - old boy and his grandfather at the @entity92 and then drove to a nearby @entity92 retirement community where he shot and killed a third person			2
police arrested a suspect , @entity96 , who shouted " @entity98 " after he was taken into custody			0
@entity96 , who also goes by @entity96 , is a well - known right - wing extremist who founded the @entity101 and the @entity101 , according to the @entity102			1
a similar attack to the one that @entity96 is accused of in @entity105 occurred in august 2012 when @entity107 @entity106 killed six people in a shooting at a @entity111 temple in @entity112			0
page was a member of a white supremacist band and associated with the @entity115 , a white supremacist group			0
page committed suicide during the attack			0
page is not , of course , the only right - wing extremist to have used lethal violence to achieve political ends			1
in 2009 , for instance , @entity123 , @entity124 , and @entity125 raided a house in @entity128 , killing @entity123 and his daughter @entity129			2
the three attackers sought to use the burglary to finance their anti-immigration vigilante group , @entity123			0
@entity133 and @entity125 were convicted and sentenced to death			0
@entity124 was sentenced to life in prison			0
also in 2009 , @entity137 murdered dr. @entity138 , who ran an abortion clinic in @entity140 , @entity105			0
in 2010 @entity137 was convicted of first - degree murder			2
according to the @entity102 , @entity137 not only had ties to the extreme anti-abortion movement , but he also had been pulled over while driving with a fake license plate bearing the markings of the @entity146 , a movement of individuals who deny that the government has authority over them			2
of course , the deadliest terrorist attack on @entity65 soil prior to 9/11 was the @entity154 bombing , which was masterminded by @entity155 , a man with deep ties to far - right militant circles			1
@entity155 killed 168 people when he bombed the @entity160 federal building on april 19 , 1995			0
despite the history of deadly violence by individuals motivated by political ideologies other than that of @entity76 , it is jihadist violence that continues to dominate the news and the attention of policy makers			1
some of this is quite understandable			0
after all , on 9/11 @entity76 's 19 terrorists killed almost 3,000 people in the space of a morning			1
since then @entity76 's branch in @entity176 tried to bring down -- with a bomb secreted on a passenger -- an @entity65 commercial jet flying over @entity180 on christmas day 2009 and @entity76 's branch in @entity182 tried to launch bombings on the @entity185 subway system a few months earlier			1
luckily those plots did n't succeed , but certainly if they had , the death toll would have been on a large scale			0
yet the disparity in media coverage can have serious consequences			0
@entity13 told reporters that he had heard reports that the @entity14 had spoken to a neighbor about their plans adding " you know we have the ' see something , say something ' campaign , " and urged that , " we need to hear about those times when individuals or groups of individuals are talking about going out and committing acts of violence -- whether it 's against the police or anybody else in our community			1
" indeed , in a report on countering radicalization in @entity212 communities , the @entity212 emphasized the need to inform law enforcement when an individual is ejected from a community for being extreme			0
countering violent extremism can not simply be a demand placed on @entity212 communities to prevent jihadist violence			0
in the decade since 9/11 right - wing extremists have demonstrated their ability to be just as deadly as their homegrown jihadist counterparts			1
moreover , killings like the ones of the two police officers in @entity5 on sunday demonstrate the need to move beyond the view that the only threat of terrorism or extremist violence comes from radicalized @entity235			1
a promising development to that end is that @entity65 attorney general @entity238 announced last week that he is reconstituting a @entity240 task force on domestic terrorism , focused on anti-government plots and racial violence			1
the task force was originally launched after the 1995 @entity154 bombing .			0

@entity246 : shooters in @entity5 murders had extremist , anti-government views
it 's far from the first instance of extreme right - wing terrorism in the @entity65
since 9/11 , more have died in far - right violence than @entity235 terrorism , @entity246 says
@entity258 : authorities should pay more attention to the threat posed by homegrown extremists
