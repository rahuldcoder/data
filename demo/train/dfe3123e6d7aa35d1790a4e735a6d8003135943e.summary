@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has put the stoning sentence of a woman convicted of adultery and murder " on hold , " @entity1 @entity4 spokesman @entity3 told state - run @entity10 on wednesday			1
while the statement did not differ greatly from previous , sometimes contradictory reports from the @entity1 government about the fate of the woman , @entity17 , it did indicate continued attention to the murder aspect of her case			1
" the sentencing of ms. @entity17 for adultery has been stopped and ( her case ) is being reviewed again , and her sentencing for complicity in murder is in process , " @entity3 said			1
@entity17 was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning , but her son and human rights activists urged help for her this summer , prompting an international outcry			1
there have been conflicting reports about the murder charge , which relates to the death of @entity17 's husband			1
@entity17 's previous lawyer , @entity38 , said last month his client had been sentenced to death for the crime but that the sentence was commuted because the victim 's family forgave her			1
@entity17 , however , told the @entity46 newspaper @entity45 last month that she was acquitted of the murder in 2006			1
@entity17 , who spoke to the newspaper through an intermediary , said the man who actually killed her husband was identified and imprisoned for the crime			2
@entity3 said those concerned about @entity17 's condition should have some consideration for the family of the victim , according to @entity10			2
" defending a person on trial for murder should not be turned into a human rights matter , " @entity3 said			1
@entity17 gave an interview to state - run tv last month in which she said she knew about a plot to kill her husband but that she had not taken it seriously at the time			2
" the man entered my life and fooled me with his words and said let 's kill my husband , " she said in the interview , which was criticized by human rights groups			2
" he fooled me and said i 'll do this for you , what a bad husband , i 'll take care of you			0
he was my husband 's cousin , and he said things about my husband			0
" then i realized , when i went to prison , he had a criminal record and that this was his third criminal record , and when he said we should kill my husband , i could n't even believe him or that my husband would die , i thought he was joking , that he had lost his mind			0
" when my husband 's mother was at our house one day and i went to get her medicine , i saw him there with all the tools he had bought , including electrical tools , wires and gloves			0
then he killed my husband by connecting him to electricity with the electrical wires			0
he had told me beforehand to send my kids to their grandmother 's house			0
" the prosecutor of @entity98 , @entity99 , said on the same program that " the deceased was given an injection to fall asleep by his wife , then the man arrived and put him into the bath and put two electrical lines on his body and killed the deceased			0
