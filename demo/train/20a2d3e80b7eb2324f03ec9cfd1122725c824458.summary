-- @entity1 have closed the gap on leaders @entity3 at the top of the @entity6 after a @entity8 header and a @entity9 double gave them a comfortable 3 - 1 win at @entity12 on monday			1
@entity8 was left unmarked to nod home @entity9 's 20th minute corner to put the defending champions on their way to a second victory in a week -- following last tuesday 's 2 - 1 home success over @entity3			1
@entity12 were unlucky not to level before half - time when midfielder @entity21 's fierce low drive was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper @entity23			2
but @entity9 doubled the advantage just past the hour mark when he converted from the penalty spot after substitute @entity27 was tripped in the area by defender @entity29			0
and the @entity31 midfielder was on hand again four minutes later when he slid the ball home after @entity27 's pass had split @entity12 's defence wide open			0
but @entity12 continued to battle away and they scored a late consolation goal when @entity21 found the corner of the net after being set - up by @entity40			0
the result means @entity1 stay in fourth place , nine points behind @entity3 although they do have a game in hand			1
however , @entity12 remain in relegation trouble and they lie in 15th place , just two points and three positions above the relegation zone			1
meanwhile , in @entity54 's @entity53 , @entity52 beat @entity55 2 - 1 to improve their chance of avoiding relegation			2
@entity52 's victory means they are up to 13th position , five points clear of the bottom three , while @entity55 are ninth and look clear of relegation danger .			0

@entity1 *consolidate* fourth place in @entity6 after beating @entity12 3 - 1
a @entity9 double and @entity8 's header gave the *visitors* three points
