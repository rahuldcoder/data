@entity1 , @entity0 -- thousands of people who filled the streets of @entity1 tuesday hope their demonstrations against corruption and failing economic policies will cause upheaval in the government , like the similar protests in @entity11 that inspired them			1
but analysts caution that in @entity0 , the protesters are up against a different set of challenges			1
@entity17 , a @entity18 historian at the @entity19 and blogger , describes @entity11 as " a little bit unique			1
" " there have been lots of civil wars			0
there 's been lots of societies in turmoil			0
but this kind of phenomenon where you had crowds peacefully coming into the streets to demand a change in their own contract with their government -- in the @entity38 world proper , this is the first time it 's happened and it 's the first time since 1979 in the @entity18 , " @entity17 told @entity2 last week			0
he noted that @entity11 is the " most secular country in the @entity38 world			1
" its traditions have favored women 's rights and its @entity45 influence is negligible			0
@entity11 also lacked the oil resources of other @entity38 states and the ethnic divisions seen in other @entity18 countries , which make it harder for opposition movements to unite , he noted			1
looking at the protests tuesday in @entity1 , @entity51 of the @entity52 told @entity2 he was not seeing a " turning point or tipping point yet			2
" noting the strength of the army , he said , " the @entity0 system is too strong and too resilient			2
" a key question that will show the potential strength of the demonstrations tuesday is whether hardcore protesters will stay through the night , or whether the rallies will fizzle down , he said			2
@entity64 , a ph.d. candidate in political science at the @entity66 and a former @entity68 fellow in @entity0 , wrote in the @entity69 , " @entity0 's liberal activists overwhelmingly come from the wired generation of @entity72 and @entity73 , and this makes them optimistic that pro-democratic movements can go viral , even in a political environment as traditionally illiberal as the @entity18 ... yet @entity0 activists face tremendous odds -- in particular , an entrenched dictatorship that is determined to discredit the very idea of domino - effect democratization			2
" @entity82 published a story thursday from writer @entity84 in @entity1 headlined , " after @entity11 : why @entity0 is n't ready to have its @entity85			1
" some @entity0 " believe the time is now " for protests to bring about change like in @entity11 , and several people in @entity0 have set themselves on fire or attempted to in recent days -- much like the self - immolation of a young unemployed man in @entity11 that sparked protests in that country , she writes			1
" but in @entity0 , it does n't go much deeper than that			2
" a greater percentage of @entity0 's population than @entity11 's lives below the poverty line , she writes			1
" the citizens of @entity0 regularly complain of a neglectful regime that knows more about torture than it does about public service , and they 're furious with a regime that seems to swallow any domestic profits before they can reach the lower classes			0
and yet no one predicts a revolutionary reset anytime soon			0
" two factors distinguish @entity0 from @entity11 in this respect , @entity84 writes : @entity11 's government spent generously on education , creating a frustrated educated but unemployed population			1
and in @entity0 , " the military stands with " @entity0 president @entity118			0
@entity82 is a partner of @entity2			0
writing in @entity121 , journalist @entity120 suggested the " upcoming protest in @entity1 could mark the beginning of another upheaval			0
" " tuesday will be the first real test of whether the revolution is contagious , " he wrote in a story published monday			0
many protesters believe their demonstrations will prove to have far more power than naysayers suggest			0
a facebook page that has served to help organize tuesday 's protests in @entity1 says , " many young @entity0 are now fed up with the inhuman treatment they face on a daily basis in streets , police stations and everywhere ... @entity0 are aspiring to the day when @entity0 has its freedom and dignity back , the day when the current 30 years long emergency martial law ends and when @entity0 can freely elect their true representatives			1
