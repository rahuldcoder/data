@entity1 , @entity0 -- it may lack the prestige of @entity5 , but this year 's @entity6 was an equally glitzy and glamorous affair , attracting some @entity9 heavyweights			2
@entity10 is a rising star among the new wave of @entity13 filmmakers currently being feted in the country			1
in its 55th year , the 10th oldest film festival in the world , showcased an array of @entity19 and global talent			2
but one group that has been woefully ignored by @entity22 cinema are its indigenous people or @entity24 as they are more commonly known			1
the indigenous cultures of @entity22 are said to be some of the oldest in the world -- going back at least 65,000 years , it is argued			1
however , throughout the country 's history , aborigines have been marginalized and discriminated against in @entity22			1
in films , @entity13 people were often portrayed as the threatening , primitive " other , " in need of civilization by the white settlers			0
examples of this treatment can be found going back to the early 20th century , in the 1936 film " @entity42 " and the 1950 film " @entity41			0
" widely recognized as natural story tellers , with a long history of oral tradition , passed down through generations , indigenous people have fought to develop a distinctive voice and have a determining role in how they are represented in @entity22			1
one of the earliest instances of filmmaking by an indigenous director was the 1979 film , " my survival as an @entity56 , " by civil rights campaigner @entity54			1
however , it was not until the early 1990s that the government made a commitment to encourage and nurture @entity13 filmmakers with the foundation of the indigenous branch of the @entity63 ( @entity63 )			1
over the past ten years , the unit has discovered and nurtured a range of award - winning talents , like @entity67 and @entity68 @entity22 now has a growing number of outstanding indigenous actors and directors and there is a growing buzz around several films being developed by these filmmakers			1
writer - director @entity76 , who recently finished a road trip comedy titled " @entity78 , " says he wants to do for @entity22 film " what @entity80 and @entity81 did in the 70s and 80s [ for black people in @entity86 films ] " the interest in @entity13 films has reached fever pitch with established white directors like @entity91 and @entity92 also making films with indigenous themes			1
@entity91 's powerful 2002 film " @entity96 " was based on the true story of the " @entity98 " of @entity13 children , who were forcibly removed from their families and placed with white foster parents			2
while de @entity92 's successful 2006 film " @entity103 " was the first ever to be filmed entirely in one of @entity22 's indigenous languages			1
it was screened at the @entity107 , where @entity92 received a special jury prize			0
among the rising indigenous stars of the future is award winning director @entity10 who is from the @entity113 tribe			2
@entity10 's documentary " @entity98 " , was nominated for an @entity114 in 2000			0
she is currently working on her first feature film , " @entity115 " , which will be produced by @entity91			0
she told @entity2 her work is primarily driven by a passion to give a voice to her people			2
" i have a love and a passion to tell indigenous stories on the screen			2
i basically want to see more black people on the screen and some of their stories represented			0
" " we are very fortunate in @entity22 that we have funding from the government and the @entity63 , they have been instrumental in supporting indigenous filmmakers and developing their careers , " she told @entity127			1
her touching film " @entity135 " follows indigenous actress and star of " @entity103 , " @entity134 as she strives to achieve her dream of becoming a movie star like her idol @entity140			2
watch an extract from @entity135 @entity134 , a 42 - year - old mother of three from the remote community of @entity143 in @entity145 @entity144 , approached @entity10 to make the documentary			0
" @entity134 had an identification with @entity140 and skin color did n't seem to be an issue or a barrier , @entity10 tells @entity2			0
" she wanted to look beautiful and be sexy and become a movie star , and i thought you ca n't get further away from @entity13 culture than @entity140 and that got me into her story			2
" with several @entity63 funded projects , like " @entity159 " in the pipeline and indigenous film festivals around the country , the current enthusiasm for indigenous filmmaking seems to know no bounds			1
one reason for this can , perhaps , be attributed to the fact that @entity22 seems to be in a state of flux			1
under a new leadership , the country appears to be in a contrite mood of reconciliation -- not dissimilar to @entity173 's post-apartheid years -- and is acknowledging past mistakes			2
in february , new prime minister @entity175 issued an historic apology to @entity13 people for " the indignity and degradation inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture , " over two centuries of white settlement			0
arts minister @entity184 is also a part of this new wave of politicians determined to reverse the divisive policies of previous decades			0
in his former incarnation as lead singer of @entity22 rock band " @entity192 , " @entity184 played an instrumental role in bringing global attention to the plight of indigenous @entity22			1
the band 's performance of their famous hit " beds are burning " at the @entity200 was notable for their decision to wear tracksuits emblazoned with the words " sorry "			0
@entity184 told @entity2 's @entity127 , he is confident that indigenous filmmakers have a big future in @entity22 cinema			1
" one thing that we do know is that the indigenous culture is incredibly important to @entity22 , " he said			1
" these people have been in this land for a very long period of time and they have many powerful stories to tell			0
" and we are starting to see a generation of young film - makers coming through and they will be provided with particular support and opportunities to begin their craft by making short films and as they become more experienced , go on to make bigger movies as well			0
" i confidently predict that we will see some absolutely outstanding films produced by our indigenous filmmakers in the coming years			1
" however , for all the buzz and optimism currently surrounding indigenous filmmakers , @entity10 is keen to emphasize that life is still incredibly hard for @entity24 , especially those who live in remote parts of the country			1
" one of the things i wanted to illustrate in the documentary was to show how hard it is in indigenous communities in remote @entity22 , " she says			1
in her film , we see @entity238 struggle to readjust to her life in @entity143 after the glamour of traveling to cosmopolitan locations like @entity5 with " @entity103 " and the profound difficulty she faces in applying for a performing arts course			0
it takes seven weeks and a 6 km trek into town just to get her application in			0
@entity134 also faces resentment from her neighbors who perceive her as becoming more like @entity250 ( white ) because she has traveled out of her community			0
" if you want to do something with your life , like acting , it is much harder than most people realize			0
it does n't matter if you have contacts like @entity92 and @entity91 like @entity134 has , " @entity10 added			0
" i wanted to raise some questions about the cultural gap between traditional communities and white culture			0
" i hope it brings some insight into the entrenched cultural and social problems that exist in these remote places			0

@entity24 have fought to develop a distinctive voice and tell their own story
they are a group traditionally marginalized and discriminated against in @entity22
