@entity0 -- outside @entity3 , nobody gave them a prayer			0
@entity3 had coughed and spluttered their way to the @entity7 , at which point they were expected to be thrashed buy the red - hot favorites and tournament hosts @entity11			1
but the @entity13 fans did n't care			1
on sunday morning they turned out to cheer on their team at various fanzones across the country and they almost saw them produce one of the biggest rugby shocks of all time			1
they came out in their tens of thousands , many with tricolor facepaint , almost all with red , white and blue flags			0
there was even the rooster , a seemingly obligatory at every @entity13 rugby event , trying to peck at a kiwi - the small , tropical fruit , not one of conspicuous @entity11 fans who was 11,500 miles from home			1
for @entity11 , @entity3 are the bogey team			1
@entity3 were not fancied to win their @entity33 games against the @entity11 in 1999 and 2007 , but on both occasions they came from behind to knock them out			1
they may have failed to impress during this tournament , but the @entity13 fans knew that their team had the quality and they were due a good game			2
and they delivered it today			0
a huge roar went up outside the @entity41 as the @entity13 squad fronted up to the @entity11 ' haka war dance			1
and in the opening minutes , @entity3 took the game to the hosts			0
this was not going to be the one - way traffic that almost all of the pundits had forecast			0
even when @entity52 crossed over to score for the @entity11 , the fans around me were not concerned			2
the @entity13 were playing confident , flowing rugby , the @entity11 were missing kicks and as the game progressed , the hosts were looking rattled			1
the street cleaners paused to lean on their brooms to watch the giant screen			0
the soldiers on duty - bristling with machine guns - were glued to the action			1
and when the @entity13 captain @entity66 scored his second - half try , the chorus of cheers was deafening			1
it was well and truly game - on			0
sadly for the @entity13 , that was all they could muster			2
the @entity11 just held on for a narrow one point win and the crowds in @entity3 disappeared into the afternoon autumnal sunshine			2
they had lost the game , but it was almost a moral victory			0
in the same week that the @entity13 government 's role in the @entity82 conflict was acknowledged as being pivotal , @entity13 national pride was restored in the sporting arena			2
they stood up and were counted			0
they contributed to a thrilling world cup final and they showed that they deserved to be there .			0
