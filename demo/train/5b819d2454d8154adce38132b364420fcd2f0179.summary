-- @entity1 is bracing for a critical showdown , as anti-government protesters vow to occupy key @entity5 locations for a month beginning monday , in a massive show of political might intended to shut down the capital and force an end to the political deadlock gripping the nation			1
why are the protesters demonstrating ? since the government 's botched attempt to pass a controversial amnesty bill in november , protesters have been taking to the streets and occupying government buildings , calling for an end to the elected government of prime minister @entity21			1
they accuse @entity21 of being a puppet of her brother , the ousted prime minister and telecommunications billionaire @entity25 , who was overthrown in a 2006 military coup			1
in response to the crisis , @entity21 dissolved parliament on december 9 , calling new elections to be held on february 2			2
but the move failed to mollify protesters , with the opposition @entity33 , closely aligned with the protest movement , announcing a boycott of the vote			0
led by @entity38 , a former deputy prime minister and @entity39 mp who resigned his parliamentary seat in november to spearhead the protests , the demonstrators are demanding that no elections be held until major political reforms are implemented			2
why are the opposition refusing to participate in the polls ? protesters contend that @entity25 's immense fortune has allowed him to warp @entity1 's fragile democracy in his own interests , giving him an unfair advantage and making substantial reform necessary			1
. @entity38 has outlined his preferred vision for the current government to be replaced by an unelected " people 's council , " made up of representatives from various professions and led by a prime minister appointed by the @entity1 king			1
the council would be charged with implementing a wide - ranging program of reform , including restructuring the police force and decentralizing power to provincial governors			0
but observers say that the @entity66 would be unlikely to win anyway against @entity21 's @entity67 , which commands significant support in the populous rural areas of north and northeast of @entity1			1
@entity25 - affiliated parties have consistently triumphed in parliamentary elections since 2001			2
how ugly are monday 's protests likely to get ? the specter of the 2010 crisis , when a crackdown by security forces on @entity80 " red shirt " protesters occupying upscale parts of @entity5 left about 90 dead , looms large over the current impasse			1
but despite the high tensions , the recent protests have been largely peaceful , with eight deaths in contrast to the bloodshed of 2010			0
back then , the protesters immobilizing @entity5 were supporters of @entity25 ; this time , they are opponents of the tycoon and his sister			2
the @entity80 " red shirts " remain players in the current crisis , however , with rallies in support of @entity21 's government scheduled to be held around the country this weekend			1
organizers have told state media they will not protest near the anti-government demonstrations monday ; similarly , @entity38 has similarly promised the anti-government protesters will be peaceful , assuring @entity1 state media the demonstrators will be non-violent , unarmed and restricted to seven locations in the capital			1
nevertheless , the @entity109 @entity108 has issued an advisory to its citizens to avoid demonstration areas , warning that while recent protests had been generally calm , they had the potential to " escalate into violence without warning			0
" " most of the protestors will be peaceful , " said @entity118 political columnist @entity117			0
" it 's the few in the militant wing that we have to watch out for			0
" the @entity109 and other @entity1 allies have been urging the country to resolve the deadlock by proceeding with democratic elections			1
how much support remains for @entity38 ? after months of political instability , @entity129 are growing weary of the impasse , says @entity117			1
" the support for @entity38 is waning ... because many have begun to see that this is a road that leads to nowhere except for achieving changes through intimidation and violence , and possibly a military or judicial coup , " he said			0
nevertheless , he said , @entity38 still drew strong support from his political base , broadly drawn from @entity5 's middle classes and members of the old establishment threatened by @entity25 's rise			2
" @entity38 can still command a large number in the streets , " he said			0
where 's the military in all this ? observers are watching keenly as to whether @entity1 's military , which dislodged @entity25 from office in 2006 and has launched more than a dozen coups or attempted coups during the country 's democratic era , will play a similarly decisive role in breaking the current deadlock			1
the army has thus far declared itself neutral in the conflict , and has proven reluctant to assist in defending government agencies from protesters			0
what triggered the current crisis ? @entity21 's prime ministership was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in november			1
the bill would have nullified @entity25 's corruption conviction , allowing him to return to the country			2
the tycoon has been living in exile in a number of different locations , most recently @entity177 , while continuing to play an active role in @entity1 politics , since being sentenced in absentia to two years jail over a controversial land deal in 2008			0
how is the crisis impacting @entity1 's economy ? the @entity1 economy is already feeling the effects of months of turmoil since november , said @entity189 economist @entity188 , with the tourism sector suffering and significant investments in infrastructure projects deferred			1
while @entity1 , southeast @entity195 's largest economy , had rebounded well economically from crises in 2006 and 2010 , the picture was less rosy this time			2
" the difference this time around is the economy was n't in good shape even before the crisis , " said @entity197			0
" @entity1 has very high household debt ; exports are not quite picking up			0
" " the longer the impasse lasts , the worse it is for the economy , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

anti-government protesters plan to occupy key areas to " shut down " the @entity1 capital
they hope to break the political deadlock gripping the country ; force @entity21 's government from office
protesters allege @entity21 is a puppet of her brother , former @entity25
observers say some @entity129 are growing wearing of the protests months into the political crisis
