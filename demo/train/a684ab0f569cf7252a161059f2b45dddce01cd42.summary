-- what do drug addicts , serial dieters and children from troubled homes have in common ? more than you might think			0
stress can play a pernicious role in triggering a vicious cycle that leaves these groups overwhelmed by uncontrollable impulses and distracted by negative feelings -- all of which may , in turn , spark subsequent cycles of relapse , bingeing and failure			1
through a career that spans almost three decades , @entity19 , psychologist and head of the @entity21 , has sought to understand the processes underlying these stress cycles in hopes they may one day be prevented			1
the dance of human emotions for @entity19 , it all began with emotions			1
she was 9 years old and living in her native @entity30 when she began training in classical indian dance , which is heavily focused on experiencing and expressing emotions			0
@entity30 dancers use facial expressions and hand gestures to tell the stories of people 's sacred lives			2
" @entity40 tied me to the powerful effects of our emotions , " she recalls			0
psychology plus ballet : meet ' dr. dancer ' @entity19 practiced the art form through college , growing ever more fascinated by how brain and physiology affect emotions and how emotions motivate behavior			1
she started her career by working with individual emotions such as anger and sadness , examining how they affect the body and change our response to different stimuli in the environment			0
what she observed back then was that people do n't generally have pure emotions -- that is , they do n't feel just angry or fearful -- but that their emotions are often mixed			2
" if you asked them how they were feeling , they would say they were stressed or upset , " she says			0
she set out to understand how emotions work together , both to protect us and to cause the stress that can wear us down			2
the habit of addiction in 1994 @entity19 was running the substance abuse treatment unit at @entity21			1
as the clinical director , she was doing research on cognitive behavioral treatments that taught recovering addicts how to identify problems and overcome cravings			2
although the research showed that these skills worked , they tended to have only modest effects ; a number of people benefited , but that number was not large			2
" i would run these groups in my clinic and see the same individuals come back over and over again , " @entity19 recalls			1
" they would tell me , ' i know what i 'm supposed to do , i have these skills , but when i 'm out there and something happens , i just ca n't help myself			0
' " " the biggest challenge with addiction , of course , is relapse , and i set out to understand what drives relapse ; what brings these behaviors back			1
" it became clear that there was often a threshold moment during which some kind of a challenge or trigger prevented the recovering person from accessing his or her cognitive resources			0
the way the emotions were flooding the person somehow led to a greater risk of relapse			0
in each case , @entity19 observed that stress played a pivotal role in the loss of control			1
clearly @entity19 and her colleagues could n't be out there with each person as he or she was relapsing , but they set out to replicate the behavior in a laboratory setting			1
" we began to bring addicted people in recovery into the lab and gave them a series of challenges in controlled experiments			2
we found that when addicted individuals were under stress , they almost automatically wanted to start using drugs again			2
" the research began to establish a clear pattern of stress - induced craving for drugs -- both for those early in recovery and those who were actively using			2
and it was n't just higher levels of anxiety and negative emotions that were making the recovering addicts seek relief from the stress ; there was also a parallel process happening -- the stress was actually escalating the craving for the drug			1
replacing addiction with a healthy obsession subsequent experiments showed that stress played an important role in the loss of self - control across a spectrum of behaviors , including gambling and the consumption of tobacco , alcohol and food			1
" we started to look into the brain to see what was happening and found that during those periods of arousal , the ' habit ' regions in the brain were activated , " @entity19 says			1
she and her colleagues spent a lot of time teasing apart this mechanism in an attempt to figure out how to break the cycle of addiction			2
" we have lots of habits that are very important for survival			0
it 's a very evolutionarily hard - wired response that comes from a primitive need to respond very quickly			0
it 's very hard to break that link			0
" drugs , food and habitual behaviors all have a direct effect on the biology of stress			1
it 's a feed - forward model , @entity19 observes			1
her research has shown that stress begets more stress			2
this is of particular concern because there 's a direct link between stress , anxiety , depression and chronic disease			2
" we are now studying medications and interventions that both downgrade stress and decrease the promotion of habits , " she says			2
" we are going after stress - induced cravings , thinking that if you target those cravings , you may be able to stop relapse			1
" stress and the brain while we have long known about the connection between addiction and stress , and how stress can increase our susceptibility to chronic diseases , we have only recently begun to understand the biological mechanisms			1
stress triggers the evolutionary " fight or flight " arousal response , where the whole body gears up to move quickly to get out of danger			2
as part of this arousal , the body releases the stress hormone cortisol and ramps up by using our energy stores , which release glucose and insulin so that muscles have the energy to deal with the stress			2
substances like alcohol , nicotine and cocaine -- and high - fat , high - calorie comfort foods -- can serve as powerful modifiers of the stress system			0
they change our stress pathways and affect the way we are able to control our response			0
the brain area most vulnerable to stress , including early childhood stress , is the prefrontal cortex , which is crucial for metabolic homeostasis , or stability , as well as for survival and adaptation			0
stress we face as children stays with us " the prefrontal cortex is also the region important for self - regulatory activities of all kinds , both emotional and cognitive , including impulse control , and regulation of emotion , cognition and desires , " says @entity19			1
constant battering by stress wears down our ability to counteract potentially dangerous desires , such as cravings for addictive substances or foods			1
control over impulsive and dangerous behavior may also wane			0
this is the dynamic that places children from troubled home environments , and people suffering from addictions , most at risk			0
the buck stops here the @entity21 's clinical practice offers both behavioral and physical health care that incorporates traditional interventions like medication and therapy , along with alternative ones , such as yoga , mindfulness meditation , acupuncture and biofeedback			1
" we are finding that stress reduction interventions like mindfulness - based meditation can be extremely helpful to impact the stress cycle , " observes @entity19			1
" but the difficulty is that meditation on its own may not be enough to help addicted individuals			0
" and so @entity19 and her colleagues are continuing to develop multipronged interventions that may also include coaching , physical therapy and medications			1
using downward dogs to treat depression @entity19 's work , which started with the interaction between stress and addictive behavior , eventually expanded to include the gamut of behavioral addictions , from food to gambling to sex			1
she has also begun contemplating the effects of stress on motivated behaviors , both healthy and unhealthy , such as exercise and proper nutrition			1
she is particularly interested in food addiction right now ; she 's concerned about the obesity epidemic and stress - induced eating			1
she agrees that social and public health interventions are very important			0
when the cigarette tax was implemented and smoking was banned from public places , there was a dramatic drop in use			0
however , there are still a substantial number of people smoking			0
" and you really ca n't ban alcohol and high - fat foods			0
the buck has to stop at the individual level			0
my interest is in the connection between stress and behavior , and in finding ways to strengthen the mind and body so that we can resist both mental and physical disease			0
" @entity19 is not dancing much these days			1
" i am completely engaged with my work , " she says			0
" but i find it interesting that the dancing i did as a child and young person became the cornerstone of my work , that it shaped my career the way that it did			0
" and as @entity19 finds herself in a clinical care practice that includes yoga and mindfulness , she often feels as though she has come full circle , because " part of classical indian dance is based on yogic principles			1
" in its own way , she says , it has been an interesting and unexpected journey back home			0
