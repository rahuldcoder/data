@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been almost two weeks since @entity4 burst into our hotel in @entity0 , desperate for the world to hear her story of rape and torture			1
we had been trying since then to interview her in person and were finally able to speak to her wednesday , against the explicit wishes of the @entity1 government			1
" you should not be allowed to do this , " government spokesman @entity16 told me			1
the interview with @entity21 was facilitated by @entity23 's son @entity22 and was subject to a government review			1
we asked @entity21 if she would be willing to come to @entity23 's office			1
she agreed and @entity23 sent a car to pick her up			1
she and @entity23 met privately before our interview , the first time the two had met			1
he commented on her strong character and willingness to challenge him when they disagreed			1
he and his press assistant sat in on the 30 - minute @entity2 meeting			2
some of the time , we were alone with her			2
she came dressed in ornate black robes and with her head covered			2
she called herself an ordinary citizen , a good muslim who is conservative in her social outlook			2
she spoke with clarity and exuded strength through the conversation , adamant about clearing her name she said @entity1 state media had smeared			1
" everything they said about me is a lie , " she said			2
" i am well - educated unlike the way the @entity1 tv portrayed me			1
i come from a good family , regardless of what they said , i am also not mentally challenged like they said			2
just because i raised my voice and talked to the media they blamed me and questioned my sanity			2
nonetheless , i want my rights , even without the media			2
" she spoke of her abduction , of how she was taken to one of the residences of @entity69 's soldiers			2
they were drunk , she said			0
they tied her up , beat and raped her			0
her bruises had faded , but i could still the see the evidence of her agony around her wrists			0
she said in the height of her trauma , she took pictures with the camera on her mobile phone , lest people should not believe her later			0
" people have blamed me for showing my body , " she said			0
" i was depressed and there was no way to show people how i was tortured			0
i was brutally tortured to the point of them entering weapons inside me			0
they would also pour alcohol in my eyes			0
" she said the men who tortured her are still free , without punishment			0
later @entity23 told me : " the people responsible for raping her should face charges			1
she is a strong woman			0
" @entity97 , a law school graduate , spoke her mind in @entity23 's presence and gave no indication that she was intimidated by him , even when she accused the @entity1 authorities of lawlessness , brutality and lies			1
" i wanted to defend myself because they did not even give me the right to respond , " she said			0
that saturday , when she tried to speak to journalists at the @entity108 , she was dragged off the property			0
she was beaten and thrown in jail			0
at one point , @entity21 told her fellow citizens in eastern @entity1 and the besieged western city of @entity115 to be strong			0
after the interview was over , @entity23 objected to that line			1
@entity97 agreed to @entity23 's request that it be cut from the video , but only with full disclosure that those 10 seconds had been removed			1
@entity16 , the government spokesman , reviewed my interview and objected to its tone , to the questions i asked and to the overall content			0
but @entity23 overruled his objections			1
we were asked not to broadcast the interview until another government representative was able to look at it			0
at the insistence of the @entity1 government , we delayed transmission of the video for 18 hours , waiting for word			0
but the review never came and in the end we were cleared to air almost all of @entity21 's words with the exception of the 10 seconds that she agreed to cut			0
she was thankful for @entity23 's efforts to make the interview happen			1
" he was a humble and understanding man , and he treated me well , " she told me			1
" he said that he will take my case and help me			0
" she had asked for three things -- that she be allowed to clear her name , that her abusers are prosecuted and that she be reunited with her family in the eastern city of @entity156			1
@entity97 took the first steps to getting one of her wishes			0
she is counting on @entity23 to help her with the other two .			1

@entity23 sent a car to bring @entity4 to his office
@entity166 is not intimidated by his presence , calls him a humble man
she says she wants to clear her name , smeared on state tv
