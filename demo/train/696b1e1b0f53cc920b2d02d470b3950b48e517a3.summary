-- there 's a power struggle going on in the @entity4 government right now			2
it 's about who is in charge of cyber security , and how much control the government will exert over civilian networks			1
and by beating the drums of war , the military is coming out on top			1
" the @entity4 is fighting a cyberwar today , and we are losing , " said former @entity17 director -- and current cyberwar contractor -- @entity21			1
" @entity24 has happened over the last ten years , but it happened slowly so we do n't see it , " said former @entity23 director @entity22			2
@entity27 , whom @entity22 replaced , wrote an entire book hyping the threat of cyberwar			1
general @entity31 , the current commander of the @entity32 , hypes it every chance he gets			2
this is n't just rhetoric of a few over-eager government officials and headline writers ; the entire national debate on cyberwar is plagued with exaggerations and hyperbole			1
googling those names and terms -- as well as " cyber @entity45 , " " cyber katrina , " and even " cyber @entity48 " -- gives some idea how pervasive these memes are			1
@entity51 " cyber " to something scary , and you end up with something really scary			1
cyberspace has all sorts of threats , day in and day out			2
cybercrime is by far the largest : fraud , through identity theft and other means , extortion , and so on			0
cyber-espionage is another , both government - and corporate - sponsored			1
traditional hacking , without a profit motive , is still a threat			1
so is cyber-activism : people , most often kids , playing politics by attacking government and corporate websites and networks			0
these threats cover a wide variety of perpetrators , motivations , tactics , and goals			0
you can see this variety in what the media has mislabeled as " cyberwar			1
" the attacks against @entity89 websites in 2007 were simple hacking attacks by ethnic @entity91 angry at anti-russian policies ; these were denial - of - service attacks , a normal risk in cyberspace and hardly unprecedented			1
a real - world comparison might be if an army invaded a country , then all got in line in front of people at the @entity102 so they could n't renew their licenses			1
if that 's what war looks like in the 21st century , we have little to fear			0
similar attacks against @entity109 , which accompanied an actual @entity91 invasion , were also probably the responsibility of citizen activists or organized crime			0
a series of power blackouts in @entity116 was caused by criminal extortionists -- or was it sooty insulators ? @entity120 is engaging in espionage , not war , in cyberspace			1
one problem is that there 's no clear definition of " cyberwar			1
" what does it look like ? how does it start ? when is it over ? even cybersecurity experts do n't know the answers to these questions , and it 's dangerous to broadly apply the term " war " unless we know a war is going on			0
yet recent news articles have claimed that @entity120 declared cyberwar on @entity142 , that @entity143 attacked @entity120 , and that a group of young hackers declared cyberwar on @entity147			1
( yes , cyberwar is so easy that even kids can do it			2
) clearly we 're not talking about real war here , but a rhetorical war : like the war on terror			0
we have a variety of institutions that can defend us when attacked : the police , the military , the @entity160 , various commercial products and services , and our own personal or corporate lawyers			2
the legal framework for any particular attack depends on two things : the attacker and the motive			0
those are precisely the two things you do n't know when you 're being attacked on the @entity172			0
we saw this on july 4 last year , when @entity4 and @entity175 websites were attacked by unknown perpetrators from @entity177 -- or perhaps @entity178			0
or was it @entity180 ? we surely need to improve our cybersecurity			0
but words have meaning , and metaphors matter			0
there 's a power struggle going on for control of our nation 's cybersecurity strategy , and the @entity17 and @entity190 are winning			2
if we frame the debate in terms of war , if we accept the military 's expansive cyberspace definition of " war , " we feed our fears			2
we reinforce the notion that we 're helpless -- what person or organization can defend itself in a war ? -- and others need to protect us			0
we invite the military to take over security , and to ignore the limits on power that often get jettisoned during wartime			1
if , on the other hand , we use the more measured language of cybercrime , we change the debate			0
crime fighting requires both resolve and resources , but it 's done within the context of normal life			0
we willingly give our police extraordinary powers of investigation and arrest , but we temper these powers with a judicial system and legal protections for citizens			0
we need to be prepared for war , and a @entity32 is just as vital as an @entity225 or a @entity226			0
and because kid hackers and cyber-warriors use the same tactics , the defenses we build against crime and espionage will also protect us from more concerted attacks			0
but we 're not fighting a cyberwar now , and the risks of a cyberwar are no greater than the risks of a ground invasion			2
we need peacetime cyber-security , administered within the myriad structure of public and private security institutions we already have			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			1

" cyberwar " is being described as a major , ever - present and ominous threat
@entity245 : cyberwar threat often hyped to make case for military control
many " cyberwar " *incidents* turn out to be criminal cases , not military in nature
he says we need better cyber security but should adopt a peacetime approach
