-- enough with the chains and whips already			0
ever since 2009 's " @entity6 , " the relentlessly dark , blood - on - your - hands record she released after being assaulted by her then boyfriend @entity4 , @entity5 , 23 , has equated falling for someone with feeling tortured			2
on last year 's " loud , " she even tried to make pain seem empowering with the hard - pounding single '' s&m			1
'' but between '' @entity13 , '' a domestic - violence saga played out with @entity14 , and '' @entity15 , '' a ragga - tinged murder ballad , she just sounded like she needed a hug			2
so it 's a relief to find that on her blissed - out sixth album , " @entity19 , " she 's stopped trying to play it so tough			1
'' i 'll let you in on a dirty secret , '' she purrs on '' @entity25 , '' '' i just want to be loved			1
'' and apparently , love 's never come so easily to @entity5 , whose new song titles include '' @entity28 , '' '' @entity29 , '' and ( yes ) '' @entity30			1
'' is she finally admitting that being young and crushed - out on someone might feel , y'know , kind of fun ? @entity35 adult rating flat , but a hit with teens true , she 's still got two token i - like - it - rough tracks -- '' @entity41 '' and '' @entity43 ) '' -- but they 're just filler on an album that 's all about dragging you out of the bedroom and onto the dance floor			1
@entity50 club king @entity49 trades @entity5 's usual somber synths for disco ecstasy on '' @entity28 , '' a song that builds and builds to a climax that 's so arena - ready it practically begs for someone to blow a vuvuzela			1
teaming with pop vet dr. @entity58 , @entity49 offers up more house - @entity60 bait with '' @entity62 , '' which begins with a cold - pulsing 4/4 beat before falling into a rapturous @entity64 - style breakdown			2
@entity65 , @entity66 on ' @entity67 ' there 's an international appeal to these songs , which were recorded in luxury suites across @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity74			0
( for the aspirational traveler , room numbers are cited in the credits			0
) when @entity5 's not singing over @entity80 - friendly thumps , she 's bouncing to a @entity82 melody , or dipping into dubstep ; '' @entity84 '' begins with a reggae drum fill straight out of @entity87 's '' @entity86			2
'' @entity88 even touts their jet - set lifestyle on the title track , bragging that he can '' fly out to @entity92 / just to get some pizza			0
'' even with all those options , @entity5 's ready to settle down on album highlight '' @entity29 , '' which begins with a @entity97 - echoing guitar riff and expands into a soaring sing - along			1
and the heartfelt power ballad '' @entity98 '' finds her pledging loyalty to a guy who takes almost as many business trips as she does : '' even though it kills me that you have to go / i know i 'd be sadder if you did n't hit the road , '' she wails , with just enough of a wink to make him wonder what she 'll do while he 's gone			0
let him get his pizza from @entity92 , but never let him forget what he 's missing back home			0
