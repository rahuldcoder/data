@entity1 and @entity7 had been level on points at the top of the table of wednesday 's clash , and the visitors took the lead in the 25th minute when @entity45 's free - kick took a deflection off midfielder @entity14 and looped over @entity47			1
@entity14 's @entity49 team - mate @entity48 made amends with a superb volleyed equalizer four minutes before half - time from @entity15 ' right - wing cross			2

" they did n't do anything in the first half , " @entity83 said on @entity65			2

if we had scored a goal , it would have finished the game off			0
" @entity26 coach @entity109 , whose side closed to within two points of the @entity112 , said : " these three points are worth their weight in gold and we 're satisfied because we beat great opponents			0
" @entity88 was fouled by @entity26 goalkeeper @entity117 just inside the penalty area in the 28th minute , but then saw his weak spot - kick saved and @entity120 fired the rebound over the bar to add to an earlier easy miss by the the @entity124 forward			0
left - back @entity91 equalized in the 72nd minute with a superb 25 - meter strike , then substitute @entity92 -- who had teed him up for that effort -- fired the winner with seven minutes left and @entity128 struck the visitors ' woodwork with a long - range shot			0
@entity20 moved up into second place with a 4 - 0 crushing of 10 - man @entity134 , as @entity136 netted twice			0
@entity138 headed the opener just before halftime from @entity142 's right - wing cross , @entity137 made it 2 - 0 with a free - kick in the 74th minute before @entity136 struck four minutes later			2

@entity154 put @entity147 2 - 1 up in the 73rd minute , but @entity151 kept their hopes of a first @entity157 finals appearance alive when @entity158 scored from a trademark free - kick two minutes later			1
@entity160 netted the only goal in @entity162 from close range in the 25th minute , scoring just his nation 's seventh of the qualifiers as @entity153 crashed to an eighth successive defeat .			0
