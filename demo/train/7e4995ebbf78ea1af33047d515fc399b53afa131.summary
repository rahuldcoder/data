@entity0 -- a newly discovered painting by @entity4 master @entity3 has sent shock waves through the art world , prompting speculation that more of his paintings could be as yet undiscovered			1
the " @entity14 " was , for years , thought to be a painting by one of @entity3 's pupils or associates			1
but after a lengthy period of study and conservation , it has been authenticated as a @entity3			1
the painting was sold in 1958 for Â £ 45 -- about $ 125 in today 's currency -- by descendants of @entity23 collector sir @entity22 , who bought the painting in 1900			0
today , the painting is estimated to be worth $ 200 million , according to some scholars			2
though the conservator who helped to reveal the painting 's true identity called it " the rarest thing imaginable , " speculation is rife that there are other @entity3 paintings still at large , possibly lying unknown in private collections			1
there are currently some 15 authenticated @entity3 paintings in the world			1
but they are difficult to attribute , because @entity3 often left his works unfinished and some are thought to have been worked on by other artists in his workshops			2
@entity44 , @entity45 in the @entity46 at @entity47 and a leading expert on @entity3 , gives the careful estimate that there are probably no more than 20 paintings by the master in the world , which suggests there could be five more to be discovered			1
@entity55 , who conserved and restored " @entity14 " said : " it 's very mysterious , the things that happen to pictures			2
" somehow ( " @entity14 " ) leaked out of the @entity60 , was put on the market in the late 18th century and disappeared until 1900 , " she said			0
the painting sustained several over-paint jobs over the years that obscured its true identity			1
" people forget or they begin to doubt the opinion of the person who originally said it was by @entity3 , particularly if it 's been badly repaired ... it happens to pictures all the time , " she said			0
the last painting by @entity3 to be discovered was the " @entity73 " in 1909			1
other major finds in the last 100 years include the discovery of two bound manuscripts by @entity3 in a public library in @entity78 in the 1960s			2
and more recently , a chalk drawing called " @entity81 , " was discovered			0
it first appeared at @entity84 's auction house in @entity85 in 1998 and was initially thought to be a 19th - century @entity87 imitation of a @entity4 painting			0
art historian and @entity90 of the @entity91 was one of a number of scholars who authenticated the drawing as a @entity3 , though its provenance remains contested			1
" i think that there are works that we do not know , " said @entity97 and that " there are always surprises up to a certain point			0
" and given that two @entity3 works have been discovered in the space of five years , she is confident there may be more			2
works that could be out there include a wooden shield with the face of @entity111 painted on it , mentioned in 16th - century art historian @entity113 's biography of @entity3 ; the clay molds of a statue of a horse @entity3 was working on when he was living in @entity117 ; and a mural called " @entity119 , " which a forensic expert named @entity121 believes is hidden behind a @entity122 in @entity124 's @entity123			0
when it comes to paintings and drawings , @entity97 believes that a strong market is an important factor in locating them			0
" they were special years in the antiquaries ( world ) , when many people were selling art from their homes , " @entity97 said , referring to the period when the " @entity81 " and " @entity14 " were sold			1
" now , fewer people buy and so fewer people sell , so in these times you find less , " she continued			0
but that wo n't stop people believing there are lost works out there			0
" i hope always that we will find new things , " said @entity97 .			0

recent *disocvery* of lost @entity3 painting prompts speculation
true identity of " @entity14 " lay *dormant* for years until *research* confirmed it was a @entity3
scholars believe there may be up to 20 paintings in the world , and possibly more drawings
once authenticated , paintings leap in value by millions of *dollars*
