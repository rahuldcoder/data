in this file photo @entity6 civilians are seen at @entity13 refugee camp on the outskirts of @entity15 , @entity4			1
three days of heavy rains have damaged or destroyed nearly 2,000 shelters housing the refugees in the @entity19 and in @entity13 , according to the @entity1 @entity20			2
an internal @entity1 memo obtained by @entity0 painted a dismal picture for the refugees , who have been caught in mud flows and the runoff from flooded latrines			1
" due to heavy showers on 14 august 09 ... many tents and toilets were submerged / badly damaged , " the memo said			2
" reportedly more than 300 families gathered together and marched towards the main access gate of the @entity34 to protest , " the memo continued			1
" though ... not violent , they seemed disgruntled and agitated due to the sufferings and expressed their resentment by hooting and making noises			0
" the camps spread across northern @entity4 are home to about 280,000 people , who were displaced in the final months of the nation 's civil war			1
the flooding came ahead of @entity4 's monsoon season , which typically brings heavy rains to the country 's northeast from october till january			1
" if the rain continues , which is very likely , then the overall situation may go out of control of the management and lead to serious security threat , " the memo warned , saying contingency plans are being " discussed and worked out			0
" @entity55 has called for the immediate release of @entity6 civilians living in the camps , which are surrounded by barbed wire , saying they are being confined against their will , like criminals			1
" those are not detention camps , " @entity62 , a @entity63 spokesman , said in late july			0
" they are relief villages			0
all the basic facilities are being given to the people			0
" @entity62 said that barbed wire is commonly used to define barriers in @entity4 and that military guards were being used out of security concerns			2
the government fears that rebels are hiding in the camps and is screening people living in them			0
@entity4 declared victory in may in its 25 - year battle with the @entity80 rebels , but concerns remain about how the island nation can heal its deep war wounds			2
the rebels -- formally known as the @entity80 -- had waged war for an independent state for minority tamils in @entity4 since july 1983			2
as many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict			0
last month the government said it had a 18 - day plan to resettle most of the refugees , but added that a lot of work remains to be done to infrastructure and basic services destroyed in the fighting			0
human rights activists say , however , that the government is not working fast enough			0
@entity55 said @entity4 's goal now was to resettle only 60 percent of the refugees by year 's end .			1
