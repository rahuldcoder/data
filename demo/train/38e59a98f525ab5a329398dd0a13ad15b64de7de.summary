as @entity1 make up their minds and gear up to vote , @entity0 asks some of @entity1 's foremost presidential historians to weigh in on the question : what does it take to make a president great ? @entity8 : @entity10 's place in the 20th century presidential greatness is determined by being in the @entity12 at the right time -- or the wrong time			1
the presidency is a reactive job and we judge the presidents by their handling of one or two big crises , usually unforeseen			2
nobody remembers whether @entity22 or @entity10 or @entity23 or @entity24 balanced the budget			1
what we remember is the agony of the @entity28			0
the @entity31 and the threat of nuclear war			0
the winding down of the @entity35			0
@entity10 , who probably understood the presidency better than anyone else -- before or after him -- was the greatest president of the 20th century because he knew what people wanted from the highest office in the land : action , words and optimism			1
that all came together when he said he was no longer " dr. @entity46 " -- he became " dr. win @entity48			2
" while historians will argue forever whether @entity10 actually ended the depression , he did take aggressive action and fought with the right words with his " infamy " speech on december 7,1941 , after @entity30 was attacked			1
when the @entity56 was putting nuclear missiles in @entity58 , @entity23 said in private that doing nothing was the worst option and he would be impeached if he did not take action			0
in good times or bad , a president is expected to do something ! sometimes he does the right thing and becomes great for it			1
@entity8 is the author of a presidential trilogy : " president @entity23 : @entity69 , " " president @entity68 : alone in the @entity12 " and " president @entity24 : the @entity70			1
" he is senior lecturer at the @entity72 at the @entity73			0
@entity74 : @entity75 believed in the strength of character in early 1962 , my husband and i were invited to the @entity12 by first lady @entity80 because she wanted the president -- who loved history -- to listen to my husband , @entity83 , talk about @entity22			2
when the talk was over , president @entity23 asked : " do you think that what makes a president great is a war ? " my husband blanched and said , " no , @entity10 was a great president before @entity90 started			1
his domestic program had already made him a great president			1
" of course , @entity22 was a great war president			1
his saving of the @entity94 and the freeing of 4 million slaves were his greatest accomplishments			2
now , i would add that @entity75 was also a great president , because he was commander in chief in a great war and then reconstructed the world after @entity90 @entity75 drew red lines to keep the @entity56 from continually gobbling up countries			1
he saved @entity102 and @entity103 with his @entity104			0
he saved @entity105 with an airlift when the @entity56 blockaded it			0
he led in forming the @entity107 to protect @entity108			0
he started the @entity110 program to assist poor countries			0
he was behind the @entity112 of giving @entity108 $ 6 billion to reconstruct itself and be a bulwark against @entity114			0
he encouraged the rebuilding of @entity116 as a democratic and capitalist country and as a counter to @entity120			0
one should add two other momentous decisions @entity75 made that affected his greatness : he recognized the state of @entity126 as soon as it declared its independence , and he desegregated the @entity1 armed forces by executive order			1
from his earliest days , @entity75 kept a motto in his head : " a leader needed a true heart , a strong mind , and a great deal of courage			2
" and he loved what @entity138 said : " always do the right thing			0
this will satisfy some people and astonish others			0
" in a nutshell , @entity75 believed that above all else , character made for greatness			0
it just happened that his greatness came from the battlefield and its aftermath			0
@entity151 , former editor - in - chief of @entity152 , is the author of " citizen soldier : a life of @entity75			0
" @entity155 : do n't dare to be great great presidents are those who change the course of @entity1 history			1
@entity159 established the principle that ordinary people should exercise political power			0
@entity22 reversed secession and freed the slaves			0
@entity10 founded the welfare state and led the alliance that defeated fascism			1
@entity24 dismantled large parts of the regulatory state and legitimized demands for smaller government			0
not everyone agrees with the policies of great presidents ; transformation is often painful			1
great presidents are opportunists : they acknowledge @entity1 's strong bias toward the status quo and recognize that large changes are possible only when the status quo has been severely compromised			1
the greatest presidents -- @entity22 and @entity10 -- embody the paradox that they preside over the worst times , when the status quo is so broken ( the @entity28 , the @entity29 ) that it can not continue in its old form			1
great presidents appreciate that their authority is as much emotional and moral as it is institutional			1
they manifest charisma suited to their eras and convey compelling visions of new ways forward : popular democracy for @entity159 , @entity94 and liberty for @entity22 , social security for @entity10 , lower taxes and lighter government for @entity24			1
is @entity1 ripe for another great president ? not yet			1
the economy underperforms but has n't collapsed			0
the federal debt mounts but has n't prompted a flight from the dollar			0
so must we wait for things to reach a crisis before we can expect another great president ? yes			1
but this is the wrong way to view our predicament			0
we do not need a great president to fix what ails us			1
a good president will do			2
@entity211 broke the impasse over expansion to the @entity214			0
each appealed to @entity1 's core values and sense of self			1
each proposed substantial but achievable goals			0
each played politics , and played it well			0
the next president should n't strive for greatness , which would confer historical reputation but require more than the rest of us can bear			2
being a good president will be good enough			2
@entity155 ' new book is " @entity235 : @entity236 in @entity237			1
" @entity238 : presidents and war a review of polls of presidential scholars since 1948 , but especially since 1962 , reveals that all of the top great or near - great presidents , except for @entity246 and @entity215 , were involved in war during their presidencies			1
six of them -- @entity211 , @entity22 , @entity250 , @entity10 , @entity75 , and @entity251 -- were wartime presidents			1
@entity217 , @entity68 , @entity253 , and @entity254 have not secured great or near - great status in these polls because of the failed @entity257 , the successful but forgotten @entity258 , and the misguided invasion of @entity260 based on false intelligence			2
given the length , expense and unpopularity of the wars in @entity260 and @entity267 , it is conceivable that future presidents may not automatically receive the vaunted accolade of presidential greatness when they commit the nation to military action			2
taking action in a time of perceived crisis is also not always wise , as demonstrated by @entity23 's @entity276 , @entity277 's mishandling of the @entity1 hostage situation in @entity279 , and @entity24 's hostage - for - arms scandal known as the @entity281			1
this leaves us with the greatness of @entity246 and @entity215			0
how did their success as leaders emerge without waging war ? importantly , both were intellectuals while most of the wartime presidents were not			2
so their writings and peaceful actions enhanced their reputations as thoughtful presidents			2
despite @entity246 's silence about his own slaves , the principles of the @entity296 about fundamental human rights and equality still ring true			2
he also doubled and explored the nation 's land area and established the precedent of executive privilege			2
likewise , @entity10 -- despite his macho association with the @entity306 during the @entity307 and his great white hunter lifestyle -- was the first president extensively to preserve national forests and parks , support civil service reform , oppose unregulated great corporations , and promote inspection of food and drugs			1
he also was the first @entity1 president to win the @entity318 , because of his mediation of the @entity320			1
responding to crises and initiating wars may not represent the best way to determine the greatness of @entity1 presidents for the rest of the 21st century			1

@entity330 : when major crisis strikes presidential greatness is a rare thing			0
the three greatest @entity1 presidents -- @entity335 , @entity22 and @entity10 -- all came to office at times of great crisis			1
@entity335 created a nation out of a confederation of states			0
@entity22 saved the nation that @entity335 created from dissolution			0
@entity10 rescued the capitalistic economy of the nation from the @entity29 and , in @entity90 , its democratic legacy from totalitarianism			2
if history is a guide , then , presidential greatness only occurs in the crucible of major crises			0
if @entity354 terrorists detonated a nuclear bomb in @entity356 or @entity335 , or if an @entity1 attack on @entity279 's nuclear facilities generated a widespread war in the @entity360 , then the conditions would exist for the display of presidential greatness			1
let 's hope that neither @entity364 nor @entity365 will have to face such a predicament			0
