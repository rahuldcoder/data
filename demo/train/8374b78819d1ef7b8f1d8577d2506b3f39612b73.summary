@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's just after two o'clock in the morning and a never - ending queue of @entity1 commuters is waiting to get onto a bus that will take them to @entity8 for work			1
many are carrying blankets in the hopes of getting some much - needed rest while on the three - hour journey			1
the year is 1983 and this is a " blacks only " bus , where only a lucky few will get the luxury of seating as the bus travels into the city			2
a single white man stands at the front of the bus watching the daily commute			2
his name is @entity28 and he 's there to capture life on film			1
with a career spanning six decades , @entity28 has become one of @entity1 's most distinguished photographers , using a lens to chronicle the growth of a nation			1
his work adorns museum walls in @entity0 and crosses oceans to @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			2
among his most celebrated collections is his documentation of @entity46 , where he became a witness to the discrimination faced in @entity1			1
" all photographers are witnesses ... i was trying to find ways into an understanding , if you like , of who we are			2
apartheid was part of that , " he tells @entity2			2
" apartheid became very much the central area of my work but my real preoccupation was with our values ... how did we get to be the way we are ? " @entity28 's love of photography stemmed from his schooldays but it was n't until the mid 1960s , aged 32 , that he launched a career as a commercial photographer			1
his decision to work in black and white was a direct result of his desire to convey his uncompromising view of the world			1
" you need to work to look at a black and white photograph			2
it does n't immediately come to you			0
color is much more sensuous , sweet and welcoming , " he says			0
" ( for ) apartheid and the anger and the fear that it stirred , there was no other medium than black and white			0
" in the early 1980s , @entity28 was commissioned along with 19 other photographers by economist @entity85 as part of a collaborative essay on black life and poverty			1
@entity28 had not intentionally set out to visually record the apartheid system			1
but after being given the subject of public transport and working alongside his friend , @entity92 correspondent @entity91 , @entity28 began using his lens as a means of vocalizing his protest at the segregation in the bantustans -- homelands -- northeast of @entity8			1
the images he captured would become a seminal part of his photographic legacy offering a raw and naked glimpse into the hardships faced by black people who were forced into an eight - hour commute to simply go to work			1
" they had got up at about half past one or two o'clock in the morning in order to get into the queues and catch the buses , " @entity28 vividly remembers			1
" if they had n't done that of course , they would have starved because the homelands was -- and i think this is quite deliberate -- placed in a place where there was no possibility of earning a living			0
" he recalls how the hardships people were forced to endure affected him , recounting a day when he stood on one of the early morning buses asking people if he could take their photograph			0
" very soon ( @entity131 ) realized that they could n't have cared a damn about me			0
they were just interested in sitting down and if they could , getting sleep ... it was a very moving experience			0
" the resulting photographs continue to provide a stark insight into the difficulties faced during the years when the policy of racial discrimination was practiced in @entity1			1
while his images are loved across the globe , @entity28 does n't believe in taking beautiful photographs			1
to the wizened 83 - year - old , it is not about aesthetics but about expressing value			2
" aesthetics is not a term that i use			0
i 'm not interested in it			0
obviously i 'm very interested in how a picture works ... what it means			0
it 's a conversation between me , myself and the subject			0
" the use of modern technology in the photography process has allowed @entity28 to emerge from the dark room where he previously would have spent months painstakingly developing his shots			1
advances in digital scanning and printing have also helped inspire him to spend more time working in color			0
" initially i was very skeptical , so i felt that you could n't repeat or do the kind of nuanced printing in the dark room ... but you can , the technology is superb			0
" and with a wealth of experience behind him , the award - winning photographer has also turned his hand to education and passing on his craft to aspiring artists			1
in the 1980s he noticed that many young black people were visiting a small photography gallery where he would show some of his work			2
" i became acutely aware that they had not the slightest hope of attaining a reasonable degree of visual literacy or skill in photography , " he explains			0
" houses were overcrowded , they had no money , they had no running water , no electricity			0
so the possibility of being able to process films and print them is just not there			0
" with this in mind , @entity28 set about raising finance and began workshops which , he proudly states , still run to this day			1
" it 's going and flourishing , " he begins before modestly adding , " but it has very little to do with me , it has to do with the people who 've been directors there ... many of them could have earned far more in the commercial field			0
" it really was a labor of love			0
" for all the acclaim he has received , @entity28 remains unpretentious about his work , which has become a historic record of @entity1			1
when asked which piece or collection he is most proud of , he laughs off the question			0
" sorry -- first of all i do n't speak of art. i speak of being a photographer and a crafts person ... if i had to be called before a heavenly jury to account for myself , i 'd have to say ' well , look at it and decide for yourselves			2
