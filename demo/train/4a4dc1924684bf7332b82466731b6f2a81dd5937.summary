-- @entity1 will stand trial for the shooting of @entity4 -- again			1
when a @entity7 jury failed to reach a verdict on the first - degree murder charge last february , they gave @entity11 state attorney @entity10 the opportunity for a do - over , and she 's taking it			1
jury selection for the retrial begins september 22			1
it was @entity10 's prosecutors that i faced as a defense lawyer during the @entity21 trial last year -- a case with social themes echoed by the @entity1 trial			1
while the first jury hung on the murder charge involving @entity4 ' death , they did hand down a guilty verdict on three counts of attempted second - degree murder in the firing of shots at @entity4 ' companions			1
the minimum mandatory sentence will be 60 years , which , for a 47 - year - old man , is a life sentence			0
so if @entity1 , who had complained about the volume of music coming from @entity4 ' suv , is already sentenced to life in prison , why bother with another trial ? because it 's the prosecutor 's prerogative			1
we 've charged prosecutors with the authority to look at cases and to prosecute those they believe can result in a conviction , based upon the facts and the applicable law			1
we expect prosecutors to move forward with all viable cases , not just the ones they like			2
in that sense , if @entity10 feels her case is strong enough to get a conviction , pursuing the case is not just her right ; it 's her obligation			0
to a prosecutor , a hung jury could be a signal that a case is still winnable , or that , having put on their best case , they could n't convince a jury of the defendant 's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt			1
if the prosecutors have taken the time to polish and focus their witnesses ' testimony , or reframe opening and closing arguments , or adjust the presentation of evidence ( and they will certainly do all of these things ) , then they may get a different result			0
perhaps the real message the hung jury sent was " try harder			1
" @entity10 , as an elected official , may have other motivations for moving forward with a retrial			0
the @entity1 case unquestionably has social and political overtones as it is one of several recent cases where a young , unarmed black man has been killed			1
for many , the @entity1 case raises civil rights issues -- and some feel a decisive verdict in this case will have broader implications			2
retrial : did @entity1 kill @entity4 out of fear ? or loud music ? and if @entity100 is politically motivated in retrying the @entity1 case , it will not be the first time , in my view			1
@entity100 's decision to waive a grand jury and charge @entity21 with second - degree murder during an election year was politically expedient -- especially by a politician who wanted to placate her black constituents			2
but she promised a conviction she could never deliver			0
a victory in the @entity1 case would give @entity100 a chance to rehabilitate her image with constituents who actively call for her resignation -- especially in light of allegations that she disproportionately overcharges @entity120 defendants ( notably her aggressive handling of the @entity123 and @entity124 cases )			2
an acquittal would also have impact			0
but the jury -- if it 's a fair and impartial jury -- wo n't concern themselves with the politics of the case			2
they 'll be asked to render a verdict based upon only the evidence presented in court , and they 'll be asked to set aside other factors , such as the broader social considerations			0
they will have one job : to determine whether the state proves , beyond a reasonable doubt , that @entity1 did not have reasonable fear of imminent great bodily harm when he fired the shots that took @entity4 ' life			2
essentially , the trial will be asking the jury to peer into @entity1 's heart and determine if they see hatred or if they see fear			1
hatred yields a conviction ; fear justifies an acquittal			0
i do n't know what they 'll find , but here 's what i hope : i hope @entity1 gets a fair trial			1
i hope there is an impartial jury			0
if there is a conviction , i hope @entity4 ' family can find some closure			0
if there is an acquittal , i hope it is not interpreted as a blow to civil rights			0
no matter what the verdict , i know it will rekindle a national conversation about race , guns , and self - defense -- a conversation that started with the @entity21 case and rages on in the wake of the @entity184 shooting in @entity185 , @entity186			2
my fear is that we place so much significance on a particular case that we base all our hopes on a certain outcome			0
not getting the desired result then causes a natural recoil away from speaking about the underlying , more significant issues of the undeniable racial divide that still exists like a virus in our country			0
my hope is that , regardless of the verdict in @entity1 , and regardless of the result in @entity185 , we can find a way to augment a constructive conversation about the true nature of @entity207 's racial divide , a conversation that gives us the courage and understanding to do something about it together			1
fault does not rest solely on one side of the divide or the other ; rather , it is a national problem , and will only be resolved if we face it , and conquer it , as a nation .			0

@entity1 is being retried on murder charges after conviction on attempted murder
@entity227 says prosecutors have the *leeway* to seek retrial after a hung jury
he says he hopes that the trial will be fair and that it not become a political *football*
@entity227 : whatever happens , @entity207 needs to have a serious conversation about race
