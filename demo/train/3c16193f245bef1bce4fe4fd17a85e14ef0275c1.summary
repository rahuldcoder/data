have n't you had enough for a week , @entity2 ? apparently not , in @entity3 at least , where even more snow fell -- or is expected to fall -- friday , on top of the several feet that socked some places a few days ago			1
wait , that 's not all			0
after receiving up to 6 more inches of snow , bitter cold wind chills and strong winds into saturday morning , the @entity11 area could see another snowstorm sunday night into monday , according to the @entity17			1
granted , none of it will compare with the blizzard that blew through @entity3 from monday through wednesday			1
few communities were spared , with some getting buried under about 3 feet of snow			0
others , such as the @entity25 island of @entity26 , got hit by especially severe winds that knocked out power			0
and there was @entity30 , @entity25 , which had blizzard conditions -- meaning a whiteout with heavy snow and regular winds of 35 mph or more -- for 14 hours and powerful storm surges that crumbled a seawall and significantly damaged 11 homes			0
the latest weather event is n't a blizzard , but rather a " clipper " storm swooping down from western @entity41 to the east			1
it gets its name from clipper ships , sailing vessels known for their cutting speed , the weather service says			2
this time around , @entity49 is in the bull 's - eye			1
@entity51 had already begun falling before dawn friday in @entity53 , and it 's expected to add up to as much as 10 inches by the time it 's over saturday afternoon			1
that is not a lot for winter in @entity49			2
but it could be a problem , considering that crews were still rushing friday morning to clear out some of the 27 or so inches that fell from the earlier storm			0
" particularly after the storm we had tuesday , which was a monster storm , the cleanup really takes a little bit longer			2
and to have this back - to - back storm , it just makes it much more difficult for us , " @entity53 mayor @entity70 told @entity1			1
some areas of @entity49 -- all of which is under a winter storm warning through saturday -- will get hit even harder than @entity53 , with 2 more feet of snow possible in the northern part of the state			1
" clean up , clear out and stay safe , " the @entity78 advised residents			0
some of that system will affect areas farther south such as @entity25 , where daytime high temperatures should peak around or just above the freezing mark			0
that will seem practically tropical compared with the temps once the sun goes down , when wind chills will fall below freezing and wind gusts could top 43 mph			0
it wo n't get much warmer anytime soon			0
the forecast for @entity11 does n't have temps getting beyond the 20s through thursday , at least			2
that 's not beach weather , but it 's not surprising either			0
speaking for @entity97 , @entity53 's mayor expressed confidence that people will get through this latest wave of winter just fine			1
" we really do have some practice at this , " @entity70 said			0
" and this is winter in ... @entity3			2
" @entity1 's @entity105 reported from @entity53 , @entity49 .			1

@entity53 , @entity49 , mayor says back - to - back storms pose a cleanup *challenge*
the @entity11 area could see yet another snowstorm sunday night into monday
a " clipper system " sweeping down from western @entity41 is hitting @entity3
