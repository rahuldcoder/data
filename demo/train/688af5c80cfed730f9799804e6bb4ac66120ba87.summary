it should have been a peaceful , contemplative night for @entity2 , studying the @entity3 inside a @entity5 synagogue			1
but that peace was shattered when an intruder came into the @entity8 , stabbing @entity2 on the left side of his head			2
there would be no other victims , however			2
@entity14 police officers quickly arrived at the scene and -- after a verbal back - and - forth captured on video -- shot and killed the attacker			2
hours later , @entity2 -- the 22 - year - old student from @entity19 -- was in stable condition at @entity5 's @entity21			1
and authorities were trying to piece together what happened and why			2
at a brief news conference tuesday , the @entity25 's @entity24 described what happened as an " isolated incident " carried out by a 49 - year - old man well known to police			1
" at this point , ( this ) appears to involve an individual who ... has a history of being an emotionally disturbed person and acting out in other places , " @entity24 said			2
jews in the @entity38 and elsewhere -- including @entity19 , the site of several recent stabbings -- have been targeted before			2
noting that at least one witness heard an " anti-jewish comment , " @entity14 police commissioner @entity40 said that his department 's hate crimes unit is investigating			1
rabbi @entity45 , a spokesman for the @entity8 movement , said that , " according to witnesses , ( the attacker ) was overheard saying repeatedly , ' kill the @entity37 ' or something to that effect			2
" yet that was n't the only thing the suspect said , nor is it the only thing that authorities are factoring in during their investigation			1
one witness said the attacker " sounded really high or on drugs " or mentally unstable			1
as @entity40 said , " the motive at this time time : we do n't know			1
" studying at prominent @entity37 center describing itself as " a philosophy , a movement and an organization , " @entity8 dates back 250 years to @entity66			2
it has since evolved into one of the most high - profile educational , outreach and community arms of @entity72 , operating hundreds of centers worldwide , including more than 1,000 in the @entity38 alone			2
its headquarters in @entity5 's @entity76 neighborhood lies at the center of it all			1
that 's where @entity2 was around 1:30 a.m. tuesday , studying the @entity3 in a synagogue that 's part of @entity8			1
" this ... is a place where everybody is welcome , " said a man who happened to walk into the synagogue at the same time as the attacker			1
the man , who was delivering food , asked to be identified only as @entity19			1
" nobody would even look at you no matter how you look , how you sound , how act			0
" @entity19 said the attacker came in with his hands in his pockets , but was soon waving a knife and saying various things such as " he wants his @entity98 , ( then ) another minute he was saying that he wants to kill people			0
" these words and antics set most at the still - busy center on guard , but @entity2 did n't seem to notice			1
" unfortunately , ( @entity104 ) was n't aware of what ( the attacker ) was doing , " @entity19 said			1
" he was busy with a ( holy book )			0
" @entity19 described the scene as very chaotic , right up until a @entity14 police officer stationed at a nearby command post learned what was happening and came to the scene			0
he found the suspect holding a 9 - inch knife with a 4Â½ - inch blade			0
yelling , then a single gunshot a cell phone video -- taken by @entity19 -- showed what happened next			0
" throw it , just throw it , " an officer is heard saying about the knife			0
he then urges the attacker to step away from the tossed knife and put his hands up			0
the man initially complies , then slowly walks back toward the weapon			1
" @entity128 , whoa , whoa ! " someone yells out			0
an officer yells out again , " stay away from me " -- but it does n't stop the man from lunging for , and picking up , the knife he 'd briefly dropped			1
the man then starts running toward police , saying , " are you going to arrest me ? " police officers -- as , by then , there were three at the scene -- can be heard yelling as well			1
" drop the ( expletive ) knife ! drop the ( expletive ) knife ! " then comes a gunshot			0
police keep up , pointing guns toward the now - downed man and telling him to drop the knife and not to move			1
" stay down ! stay down ! " one officer yells			0
increased police presence at ' houses of worship ' the 49 - year - old was shot in the torso , according to police			0
officers continued to tell him not to move as they handcuffed him in between the synagogue 's books and desks			1
an ambulance took him to @entity21 , where he was later pronounced dead			0
the officer who shot him and two other officers were sent to @entity5 's @entity160 for treatment of tinnitus , which is a noise or ringing in the ears			1
this officer - involved death comes at a time of emotional protests over a grand jury 's decision not to indict @entity14 police officer @entity170 in the death of @entity172			0
that incident got a lot of attention in part because it was captured on video			0
@entity19 said he recorded what happened at the synagogue , and made it public , to document it and leave no doubt about what transpired			2
" people should at least see this is happening for a reason , " @entity19 said of police shooting the suspect			0
" people actually do crime			0
" no one is saying this attack is part of any larger plot , and @entity40 said police are n't calling it a terrorist attack			1
still , given that the news may cause concerns at " houses of worship around the city , our critical incident response vehicles ... will focus on religious institutions in part today , " the @entity25 's @entity24 said			0
" so you will see some enhanced coverage in terms of police presence at locations , " @entity24 added			0
" but i want to underline that is to really address those concerns while we sort through the details here , not to suggest that ... this had any connection to anything other than this individual and his problems at this time			0
" @entity1 's @entity220 in @entity221 and @entity222 in @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
