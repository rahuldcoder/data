@entity0 -- @entity5 's long - simmering war with a @entity7 insurgency has escalated over the last year , reaching death tolls unseen in more than a decade , a new report focusing on the conflict says			1
" @entity5 's @entity7 conflict is becoming more violent , with more than 700 dead in fourteen months , the highest casualties in thirteen years , " concluded the @entity9 , a conflict resolution organization that has extensively researched @entity5 's war with the @entity12 , or @entity12			1
" we 're seeing the longest pitched battles between the army and the @entity12 , we 're seeing a wide - spread campaign of kidnapping , suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the @entity12			2
they 're very much on the offensive and unfortunately this is matched by much harder line rhetoric on both sides , " added @entity22 , the chief author of the @entity9 report , in an interview with @entity1			2
115 @entity7 rebels killed in 14 days last weekend alone , at least eight @entity5 police officers and four soldiers were killed in two separate ambushes in southeastern @entity5			1
the @entity12 promptly claimed responsibility for both attacks			2
the @entity5 government , meanwhile , claims to have killed hundreds of @entity12 fighters in recent months , both in operations in southeastern , predominantly @entity7 - populated @entity5 and during air raids against suspected @entity12 camps in the mountains of northern @entity43			1
" within the last month , in the operations executed throughout the region , about 500 terrorists were eliminated , " @entity5 prime minister @entity44 said in a speech monday			2
" we will on the one hand develop @entity5 and on the other hand continue to tirelessly struggle against this terrorist organization that has bloody hands			2
" the escalation of violence and hard - line rhetoric on both sides has jeopardized hopes of bringing an end to a conflict that has bedeviled @entity5 for 30 years			1
it also threatens to destabilize a member of the @entity64 military alliance that is already grappling with the influx of more than 80,000 refugees fleeing the civil war in neighboring @entity68			0
for decades , the @entity5 state discriminated against the @entity70 , @entity5 's largest ethnic minority , which now makes up roughly 20 % of the population			1
the @entity7 language was banned , and @entity70 were long referred to as " mountain @entity5			2
" the @entity12 , led by one of its founders , @entity75 , launched a bloody campaign to carve out an independent homeland for @entity70 from @entity5 , as well as neighboring @entity79 , @entity43 and @entity68 , in the 1980s			1
the conflict killed more than 30,000 people , most of them ethnic @entity70			0
the war that raged across southeastern @entity5 subsided when the @entity12 declared a unilateral cease - fire for several years after @entity75 was captured in 1999			1
in 2005 , @entity44 's government began secret talks with @entity12 leaders			1
his @entity88 , or @entity88 , also made a number of overtures toward the @entity70 , relaxing bans on @entity7 language education , appearing to apologize for past discriminatory policies and launching a state @entity7 - language tv station			0
" the @entity88 government actually did more for the @entity70 than anyone up until now , " @entity22 said			0
" [ but ] when a wave of massive arrests of legitimate @entity7 politicians began , that 's when i think young people especially lost hope and the @entity12 's arguments for the legitimacy of armed struggle became persuasive to them			1
" @entity5 authorities have arrested thousands of @entity7 activists , intellectuals and politicians in the past several years			1
many of those targeted are members of the @entity112 , or @entity112 , a legal @entity7 political party that elected 29 members to parliament on independent ballots in 2011			0
according to this month 's @entity9 report , those arrested " include elected deputies , mayors ( some from major cities and districts ) , provincial councilors , party officials and ordinary activists			2
many have been accused of membership in a terrorist organization , but not of committing any violent act			0
" last week , 44 journalists and media workers from @entity7 news outlets appeared in an @entity0 courthouse on terrorism charges			0
many of them have been awaiting trial in prison since their arrest last december			0
" this is to silence the opposition , " said @entity138 , one of the defense attorneys in the case			0
" this is not only about press freedom but also an intervention into a citizen 's right to choose where to get news from			0
" in fact , in recent weeks , @entity5 's fiery prime minister has publicly urged the @entity5 media not to report on the growing number of @entity5 casualties in the conflict , drawing criticism from media freedoms groups			1
" @entity44 's most recent televised ' message to all the media ' crosses from reprimanding into directly instructing journalists to stop covering the long - standing conflict between the @entity162 and the outlawed @entity12 ( @entity12 )			2
this is unthinkable , " the @entity164 - based @entity163 said in a news release this week			0
one of the major obstacles to the peace process , however , is the position staked out by the leaders of the @entity7 movement in @entity5			2
@entity172 emerged last month showing several @entity112 lawmakers embracing and celebrating with armed @entity12 fighters in the mountains of southeastern @entity5			1
the scene provided further ammunition for critics who accuse the party of being a public face for the armed rebels			0
the @entity9 report also points out that the @entity112 has essentially marginalized itself from negotiations with the @entity5 government			1
" the @entity112 says ' do n't negotiate with us , negotiate with @entity75 in prison , ' " said @entity22 , the report 's chief author			0
members of the party insist they do not have the power to persuade @entity12 fighters to lay down their weapons			0
" we are not an armed group			0
if we tell them ( the @entity12 ) to lay down arms , will they obey ? " @entity198 , deputy chairwoman of the @entity112 , said in a phone interview with @entity1			0
over the last decade , @entity5 succeeded in forging alliances with neighboring @entity79 , @entity68 and @entity43 to target @entity7 rebels operating in their respective territories			0
but @entity5 's relations with all three governments have deteriorated sharply over the past several years , and the conflict threatens to spill across borders			1
this month , @entity5 warplanes repeatedly bombed suspected @entity12 camps in the mountains of northern @entity43			1
meanwhile , @entity5 watched with alarm this summer as members of the @entity68 branch of the @entity12 raised the guerilla movement 's flag over several predominantly @entity7 towns along @entity68 's border with @entity5			1
should @entity5 be afraid of the @entity70 ? this has led to accusations from @entity219 that @entity68 and its ally @entity79 are providing support to the @entity12 , charges denied by both @entity222 and @entity223			1
" if @entity5 feels vulnerable to empowered @entity70 in @entity68 , the only way to defend itself is to solve its domestic @entity7 problem , " said @entity22 , the @entity9 report author			1
the report urged the @entity5 government to expand @entity7 language education , redefine @entity5 's broad definition of terrorism and launch a package of measures for reintegration of former @entity7 insurgents			1
the group also appealed to @entity7 leaders to drop demands for a " self - defence militia " in @entity7 areas of @entity5			0
one hope for resolution of the conflict may lie in an effort to rewrite @entity5 's constitution			1
the document was drafted by a military junta that swept into power in a coup in 1980			0
@entity7 lawmakers have joined with @entity44 's party , as well as two other parties represented in the @entity5 parliament , to write a new version of the constitution			2
but these reform efforts are being overshadowed by deadly , daily attacks in southeastern @entity5			0
on tuesday morning , @entity5 television showed smoke billowing from a burning bus after a suspected @entity12 attack on a military convoy in eastern @entity263 province			1
according to @entity265 , the governor of @entity263 , the targeted convoy included buses carrying " 200 military personnel returning from their vacations unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes			0
" the governor said the ambush killed at least 10 soldiers and wounded at least 60			2
more : @entity70 ' ambitions add explosive element to @entity68 crisis			0

new : at least 10 @entity5 soldiers were killed tuesday in a suspected @entity12 attack
12 killed in @entity12 ambushes last weekend ; @entity5 says it 's killed hundreds from @entity12 recently
@entity9 says casualties are the highest in 13 years
the @entity12 , or @entity12 , launched insurgency in the 1980s in response to state bias
