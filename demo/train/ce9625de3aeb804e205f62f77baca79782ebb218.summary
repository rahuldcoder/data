-- an error from @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 saw @entity4 win 1 - 0 at @entity5 on wednesday to reach the semifinals of the @entity7 5 - 0 on aggregate			1
@entity2 allowed a second - half shot from @entity10 to slip through his fingers and crawl over the goalline to ensure the @entity15 side secured a mouth - watering last four showdown with bitter rivals @entity18			1
@entity20 's side held a comfortable lead from the first leg at the @entity23 but , despite that advantage , the @entity4 coach still decided to play his strongest side at @entity27			0
@entity28 sets record as @entity18 reach semifinals and the visitors had to hold on in the first 45 minutes as @entity5 had two good penalty appeals turned down , while @entity33 had the ball in the @entity4 net , but his goal was ruled out for offside			1
however , just five minutes into the second half , the tie ended when @entity10 attempted a strike from 25 yards out that @entity2 should have dealt with comfortably , only for the keeper to fumble the shot into the net			2
@entity43 nearly levelled for @entity5 from @entity45 's cross and defender @entity46 hit the post from close range , but @entity4 were never in danger of losing their advantage			0
the result means that @entity18 and @entity4 will now clash four times in just 18 days in what will be a monumental series of ' @entity56 ' encounters			0
first the teams meet this weekend at the @entity23 in @entity58 , before they face each other four days later in the @entity60 final in @entity61 prior to their two @entity7 showdowns			0
@entity20 -- who is the first coach to ever lead four different teams to the @entity7 semifinals -- told @entity65 : " anything can happen in a semifinal , but we have two other matches to come against @entity18 before then and must concentrate on those games first			2

@entity4 win 1 - 0 at @entity5 to reach semifinals of the @entity7
an error from @entity3 goalkeeper @entity2 enough to give @entity4 *victory*
@entity3 allows a @entity10 shot to *trickle* through his fingers
