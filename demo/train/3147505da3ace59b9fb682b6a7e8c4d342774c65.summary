-- transit officials in @entity2 reopened all downtown subway stations monday evening after successively opening and closing them to stem the threat of spreading protests			0
" all @entity9 are now @entity10 , @entity11 , " said a release from @entity8			2
the situation was fluid most of the evening , with officials trying to thwart demonstrators , closing and reopening the @entity15 and @entity17 stations , closing the @entity19 station , then at least partially reopening @entity19 to allow riders to disembark			0
police officers in response gear stood at the @entity15 station , with one officer on a megaphone telling people , " this is your final warning , the station is closed			0
" on the streets , small groups of protesters could be seen gathering to criticize @entity8 after several shootings involving its police officers -- the latest coming last month and resulting in the death of 45 - year - old @entity36			2
meanwhile , an official with the system stood by the decision to shut off cell phone service ahead of a protest last week			1
the decision thursday to " temporarily interrupt ... service at select @entity8 stations as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform " drew widespread criticism and stirred the well - known hacking group @entity51 to stage an " operation " sunday			1
the group urged those supporting its cause to attend a " peaceful protest " at 5 p.m. monday at the system 's @entity15 stop			2
" what we 're going to do is take the appropriate steps within the @entity63 , " he said			0
" there are more constitutional rights than just free speech			0
there is the right to be safe			0
" last week 's protest never materialized			2
but the decision to cut cell service elicited fresh condemnations from civil liberty organizations , the @entity75 's editorial page and others			1
" all over the world people are using mobile devices to organize protests against repressive regimes , and we rightly criticize governments that respond by shutting down cell service , calling their actions anti-democratic and a violation of the rights to free expression and assembly , " @entity77 from the @entity80 's northern @entity79 office wrote on the advocacy group 's website			1
" are we really willing to tolerate the same silencing of protest here in the @entity98 ? " online messages attributed to @entity51 took credit for the apparent hacking sunday of @entity102 , a link off @entity8 's website that showed a page featuring , among other items , the hacking group 's logo -- a smirking mask above two crossed swords , all on a black background			1
in addition , @entity114 traffic related to @entity51 boasted that hackers had been able to get into @entity8 's internal network			1
several related items and documents were posted , including one claiming to be " the @entity120 of @entity121			0
" this had e-mails and , in some cases , phone numbers and addresses of hundreds of people			0
" by ( cutting cell service ) , you have not only threatened your citizens ' safety , you have also performed an act of censorship , " a seemingly computer - generated voice -- speaking over dramatic music and images -- said in a video posted online sunday afternoon			1
" by doing this , you have angered @entity51			0
" the @entity139 is collecting information on the matter , with agency spokesman @entity142 saying monday by e-mail that " any time communications services are interrupted , we seek to assess the situation			1
" " we ... will be taking steps to hear from stakeholders about the important issues those actions raised , including protecting public safety and ensuring the availability of communications networks , " said @entity147			1
yet on monday , @entity155 emphatically stood by @entity8 's move , made on the same day @entity158 prime minister @entity157 proposed a crackdown on social media to quell riots			1
" we made a gut - wrenching decision that was forced upon us by the protesters , " @entity155 said			2
" they made us choose between people 's ability to use their mobile phones ( and ) their constitutional right to get from point a to point @entity170 " @entity0 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
