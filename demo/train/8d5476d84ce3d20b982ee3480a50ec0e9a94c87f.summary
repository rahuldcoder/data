-- @entity1 has once again hit the town with @entity3 -- but this time he let someone else wear @entity6 's augmented reality headset			1
@entity8 lieutenant governor @entity7 wore the specs on " the @entity10 , " and later told @entity0 about his brief experience with one of the world 's most rarefied pieces of technology			1
" you can easily forget you have them on , and sense the capacity of use in the future , " @entity7 told us , adding the headset felt incredibly light , comfortable and inconspicuous on his head			2
@entity1 and his wife , @entity24 , appeared on @entity7 's current tv talk show wednesday may 23 to discuss @entity3 and @entity1 's work in the @entity28 labs			1
on the show , @entity1 also provided our first glimpse into how the @entity3 interface is navigated			2
in the video , @entity1 navigates the system via a touchpad on the right side of the headset behind the display			0
he slides his finger forward and back to locate a photo he took of @entity7 with the contraption			2
he then places the headset on @entity7 's face , and continues to navigate until the photo is located			1
he also tells @entity7 , " do n't touch the pad on the side " while setting up the headset for the talk show host			2
unfortunately for inquiring minds , when @entity7 asked how the photo was taken , @entity1 did n't answer			2
@entity7 told @entity0 that he was impressed by the image quality of the display in the glasses			1
the politician - slash - talk - show - host noted that the lighting on his set is less than ideal for demoing a display , but nonetheless the " image was remarkably clear			0
" as for interacting with the real world while wearing the glasses , @entity7 said he found it easy to quickly focus on @entity1 and @entity24 sitting across the desk , and then refocus to the image of himself displayed in the headset 's screen			1
after returning the glasses to his own face , @entity1 swiped down on the touchpad of the glasses and continued the interview			0
the down - swipe could possibly be used to exit the photo album he was demoing to @entity7			0
whatever the case , @entity1 's swipes answer questions about how the interface is navigated			0
@entity1 told @entity7 that he brought a rough prototype			1
" i have some hopes to maybe get it out sometime next year , " he told @entity76 , " but that 's still a little bit of a hope			0
" with this in mind , it 's possible that what @entity7 demoed on wednesday could change radically before the final production model hits the market			1
nonetheless , even at this early stage , the glasses are impressive , @entity7 says			1
he told @entity0 that the headset was " a heck of a lot further along than people have imagined			0
" the @entity6 co-founder told @entity7 that @entity28 is now his primary focus at @entity6			1
his team has been working on the glasses for two to three years , and @entity1 as been involved for the past year			0
@entity1 also explains why @entity6 is working on the technology : " the idea is that you want to be free to experience the world without futzing with a phone			1
" one concern with wearable computers is that they 're cumbersome wardrobe additions			0
to this point , @entity7 told us that he was surprised by " how unremarkable the glasses are except for the remarkable feature			2
" that said , when asked if he would actually wear the glasses himself -- you know , in public -- the lieutenant governor replied , " i have n't seen the video yet , so i 'll withhold judgment until i see myself			1
i 'm hoping this is n't my @entity117 moment			0
" if you want to watch the full interview , the show airs on current tv at 11 p.m. et ( 8 p.m. pt ) on friday and throughout the weekend			0
