-- @entity1 produced the first major surprise of @entity3 as @entity5 's side secured a 1 - 0 win over the @entity7 in @entity8			1
famed for their @entity12 approach , the @entity10 finalists were left totally frustrated by a @entity14 side that was never fazed by the star - studded reputation of @entity17 's team			0
@entity18 scored the only goal of the game to leave @entity7 -- one of @entity3 's heavyweights -- a real challenge to qualify from @entity24 and reach the knockout stages			1
@entity28 's side next play @entity29 , who beat @entity31 1 - 0 in @entity32 thanks to @entity34 's second - half goal , in a game that never matched the drama of @entity1 's victory			1
@entity1 1 - 0 @entity7 billed as @entity24 's rank outsiders , @entity1 had to ride their luck against a @entity41 team that dominated possession for long periods in @entity8 's @entity44			1
amid those lucky breaks though @entity45 and @entity46 in central defence showed plenty of steel and when the @entity14 did get hold of the ball they produced some intricate passing moves			0
@entity14 goalkeeper @entity55 was also outstanding , notably when he thwarted @entity41 substitute @entity56 after the @entity57 forward was sent clear by @entity59 's wonderful pass with the outside of his right foot			2
who scored 48 goals in all competitions last season for the @entity68 @entity67 club , was left on the bench by @entity70 was the first surprise of saturday 's game			0
before he was introduced in the second half , @entity56 could only watch as @entity75 's eye for a goal went missing			0
a frustrating evening for the @entity41 striker , who has scored 30 goals in the @entity79 for @entity80 this season , was encapsulated when he completely miskicked the ball early in the second half			2
@entity82 should have scored early on in the game but put his shot wide and later on in the first half the @entity80 striker was thwarted by @entity14 goalkeeper @entity55 's alertness			0
completely against the run of play , @entity88 gave @entity1 a shock lead after he gathered @entity93 's deflected cross and drilled a shot through the legs of @entity41 goalkeeper @entity96			1
@entity97 then curled a left - footed shot against the post as @entity1 's goal continued to lead somewhat of a charmed life			1
the second half mirrored the first with the @entity41 pinning the @entity14 in their own half , but the @entity14 refused to be cowed and after surviving a late handball appeal against @entity107 , @entity105 's team held on to secure a memorable victory			2
@entity29 1 - 0 @entity31 saturday 's second game had been billed as one of the most intriguing of the @entity3 's group stages but it rarely failed to live up to the pre-match hype			1
it offered the tournament a first glimpse of @entity116 , who has scored 60 goals for @entity118 this season , but as to often the @entity120 forward flickered in and out of an international for his country -- in truth more out than in			0
@entity116 has scored only five goals in 19 appearances during major internatioal tournaments and with @entity31 adopting a strategy of containment he was never able to significantly influence the game			2
it was not until late in the second half that he forced @entity29 goalkeeper @entity131 into a save and for the most part @entity29 were able to minimize the @entity120 forward 's threat			2
soon after making that save @entity131 had a fortunate escape when he misjudged @entity138 's looping cross , allowing the ball to bounce off the bar			0
the @entity142 goalkeeper quickly recovered his poise to brilliantly save from substitute @entity144 , who had been set up by @entity146 's ingenious reverse pass			0
@entity138 then had a rising shot blocked by @entity148 as @entity31 finally put @entity29 under sustained pressure for the first time in search of an equaliser			1
given that late surge of @entity120 attacking activity the question is why @entity157 's side only started to test @entity29 's defense after having gone a goal behind			0
@entity29 had arguably shaded a forgettable first - half , with @entity34 going close early on with a header that was well saved by @entity162 , though @entity120 defender @entity163 did hit the upright with a clever shot following a corner			1
but it was @entity34 who finally broke the deadlock , connecting with @entity171 's cross from the right , cleverly guiding a header past @entity162 .			0

@entity1 deliver first major surprise of @entity3 with win over the @entity7
@entity88 scores winner for @entity1
@entity34 scores for @entity29 in 1 - 0 win over @entity31
@entity41 still have to play @entity29 and @entity31 in @entity24
