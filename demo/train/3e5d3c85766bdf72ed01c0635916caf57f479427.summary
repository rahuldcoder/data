editor 's note : rep. @entity2 , a @entity3 , represents the 3rd @entity4 in @entity5 and is appearing in @entity7 's " freshman year " series , along with rep. @entity8 , a @entity9 from @entity10			1
here , his wife , @entity11 , talks about how she copes with the challenges of her freshman year as a " congressional spouse			1
" @entity11 and her husband , rep. @entity2 , pose in front of a view of @entity18			1
@entity18 ( @entity7 ) -- in reality , there 's a lot more to serving in @entity5 than simply voting on the @entity23 floor			2
there are plenty of tasks -- technically optional -- that are essential for someone who wants to do this job well			0
no one makes you read the bills , but to do the job right , you must			0
there are constituents to meet with , letters to answer , staff to manage , media to respond to and new bills to research			0
these duties can eat up as much time as i can give			2
i 'm learning to balance the workload			0
the real challenge for me is setting the work aside			0
my family is still the center of my life			2
i look forward to that flight home every single weekend			0
through trial and error , @entity11 and i have learned some important strategies for making our family time count			1
i have learned to schedule time individually with each of my children			1
i also schedule time to date my wife			1
we met at a wedding in @entity63 and started dating shortly after when i was a senior and @entity11 was a junior at @entity65 in 1989			1
we married in february 1991			0
@entity11 's challenges are different from mine			1
i 'll let her explain what it 's like to be a congressional spouse			2
@entity11 : as i sit down for a moment to type , i 'm strangely aware that 10 - finger typing is much harder than thumb texting -- a symptom of my life			1
@entity76 seems to be flying , as the saying goes , and it is fun			0
since @entity2 was elected to @entity5 , i have learned to adapt to many new challenges			1
@entity2 loves his job ; i love my job			1
raising three children to be healthy , happy contributors to society is my quest			1
nurturing our 8 , 13 and 16 - year - olds is a lesson in constant motion -- or rather , commotion			0
it 's important to me that they feel centered and cared for			1
although i 'm not a perfect mother , i 've got great kids who reward me with hugs , smiles , occasional pouts and late - night chats			0
before @entity5 , i tended to deal with things day - by - day			0
now , time is precious			1
during our campaign i received some sage advice from @entity63 rep. @entity107 's wife , @entity106			1
she recommended that when @entity2 is in @entity18 , i spend time doing the things i need to do on my own , such as errands , volunteering , time with friends , helping with homework , and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes , i mastered this skill ! so , when @entity2 is home , we can use our time as a family working , reconnecting and having fun			1
i 'm a people person			0
@entity119 and friends are a big part of my support			1
i 'm the youngest of six and i have an amazing family			2
my parents and siblings are settled everywhere from @entity126 to @entity63			0
fortunately , @entity127 is a great midpoint			0
we regularly have company ; so much so that we 've earned the nickname " @entity132			0
" for day - to - day support , i 'm lucky to have two very close friends			1
our kids have grown up together and my friends are always there when i need anything : from picking my kids up from school if i 'm running late , tending our dogs when we travel , or giving me a pep talk just when i need it			2
i also belong to a book club of six women			0
we have been laughing , counseling and spilling our guts to each other once a month for the past 16 years			0
and we still manage to read good books , too			0
one of my recent favorites is " @entity150 " by @entity151			0
above all , i have learned to be flexible and keep my sense of humor			2
recently , i was in @entity18 with @entity2 when he decided the right thing to do was to fly to @entity155 and help some @entity156 out			2
although i was tempted to be bugged , i chose to be flexible			0
i spent the rest of my day without @entity2 , flew home alone , and arranged for a ride home from the airport			2
i 'm the ceo of @entity163 and lovin ' it ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity11 .			1

rep. @entity2 's wife , @entity11 , is raising three children ; writes " perspective is everything "
" @entity174 is crucial . " @entity11 used to go with the flow , but " now , time is precious "
@entity11 says support from family and close friends keeps her going
says being flexible important as plans change or the need to travel comes up
