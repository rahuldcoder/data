-- two @entity2 students could be suspended or even expelled after using a handgun to defend themselves from an intruder in their university - owned apartment , an act which the university says violates the school 's weapons policy			1
@entity2 , a private , four - year university in @entity11 , @entity12 , says the students violated the school 's weapons policy by having firearms in their apartment , which is in a complex near the campus			1
on the night of october 24 , students @entity19 and @entity21 were in their apartment when there was a knock on the door			1
@entity19 told @entity0 affiliate @entity25 in @entity11 that he opened the door and a stranger , who said he 'd just gotten out of jail , asked for $ 15			2
@entity19 told @entity25 he offered the man a blanket and a can of food , but " did n't feel comfortable " giving the man money because he was a stranger			0
" my gut instinct was telling me i was n't going to be able to get that door closed before he came through , " @entity19 told @entity25			0
as the man started coming through the door , @entity19 said , he yelled for his roommate , @entity21			1
@entity21 said he came to the door with his pistol drawn , and the students said the man turned and ran away			2
because the apartments are owned by @entity2 , both police and campus security responded when @entity19 and @entity21 called 911			1
according to the @entity2 's executive vice president @entity47 , all university housing is patrolled at regular intervals by campus security , though this particular apartment complex is n't gated and secured key cards or codes are n't required for entrance			1
a short while after the incident , police captured the man , whom they identified as a six - time convicted felon			2
at about 2 a.m. , campus security officers returned to @entity19 and @entity21 's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment			1
@entity64 , attorney for @entity19 and @entity21 , said the shotgun is owned by @entity19 , who uses it to hunt periodically , and it was n't used in the incident			1
he added that the pistol that was used in the incident belonged to @entity21 , and was a gift to him from his grandfather several years ago			2
@entity21 has a state - issued permit to carry a concealed handgun , @entity64 said			0
in @entity12 , gun owners are not required to register their weapons			0
in a disciplinary board hearing on friday , the board , made up of three faculty members and two students , found @entity19 and @entity21 guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons , according to @entity64			1
@entity64 told @entity0 the students expect to hear later this week what disciplinary action will be taken by the board			0
@entity19 and @entity21 both face suspension or expulsion			2
both are seniors and have exemplary records , @entity64 said			0
meantime , @entity19 and @entity21 have asked university security to return their firearms , but that has n't yet happened			1
according to @entity64 , one of the students had never lived in campus housing and was unaware of the school 's weapons policy			1
the other , he said , was aware of the policy but did n't think it applied to him because the apartment is n't on campus			2
" they had the right to defend themselves and others , regardless of what the policy says , " @entity64 told @entity0			0
though the university could n't talk about specifics of this case due to privacy laws , @entity47 said , " i 'm not aware of other instances like this in particular			0
" the policy , which is on the university 's official website , states that weapons , which includes firearms , are prohibited " at any location on campus , or within @entity2 residences			1
" in a statement released saturday by university president @entity130 , there have been calls for a re-examination of the university 's policies relating to firearms			0
@entity130 said in the release he believes this is an opportunity for the university community to objectively re-examine the policy and " openly debate perspectives and contextual issues			0
" @entity130 's statement said he has asked the vice president for @entity143 to work with several campus organizations to " facilitate a campus dialogue focused on this issue			0
" meantime , he added , the current student handbook and code of conduct remain in effect			0
