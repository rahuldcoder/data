@entity0 -- when @entity5 president @entity4 said monday it would be wrong to seek regime change in @entity8 by force , @entity3 lawmakers took issue -- saying removing @entity8 leader @entity11 is and should be precisely the goal			1
@entity11 must have been comforted to hear the president 's words , sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , said following @entity4 's televised address			1
" if we tell @entity11 , ' do n't worry , you wo n't be removed by force , ' i think that 's very encouraging to @entity11 , " @entity13 said , after @entity4 delivered a speech explaining @entity5 intervention in @entity8			1
@entity13 said the president 's words were " puzzling " because @entity4 has previously said that @entity5 policy is for @entity11 's ouster			1
" the reason why we wage wars is to achieve the results of a policy that we state , " @entity13 said			2
sen. @entity31 , @entity33 - @entity32 , agreed with @entity13 , his felllow member of the @entity34			2
" the goal of this country is to replace @entity11 , " @entity31 told @entity1			0
overall , however , @entity13 said @entity4 made a " strong case " for the military effort in @entity8 and laid out the reasons why the president thought it was important to intervene			1
democrat @entity42 , a former governor of @entity43 who served as the @entity5 ambassador to the @entity45 , said he was satisfied with the speech			1
@entity42 told @entity1 that @entity4 said the purpose of the military mission is to avert a humanitarian disaster , to protect civilian lives , and to prevent a refugee crisis in neighboring @entity52 and @entity53			1
he said @entity4 probably should have called more members of @entity55 before deciding to join the military effort , but he pointed out this is not a war but a limited military engagement			2
" he explained the objective and he explained what he wants to do , " @entity42 said			2
sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , a senior member of the @entity66 , and rep. @entity67 , @entity68 , both said the president failed to explain the extent of @entity5 involvement and when that will end			1
house speaker @entity73 , @entity74 , also said the president 's speech failed to provide much clarity			1
" nine days into this military intervention , @entity5 still have no answer to the fundamental question : what does success in @entity8 look like ? " said @entity73 spokesman @entity81			0
@entity73 sent a letter to @entity4 last week in which he asked specific questions about the @entity8 mission , including whether the @entity5 military would take on a larger role if the coalition fell apart			1
the @entity92 speaker also complained that the nine days it took for @entity4 to lay out the reasons for @entity5 involvement was " a long time , " according to @entity96			1
former @entity98 mayor @entity97 , a former @entity3 presidential candidate , said @entity4 's speech did n't just fail to clarify the mission but " made things even murkier than they were before			1
" " the president says our mission is to protect the people of @entity8 , " @entity97 said			2
" well , how do you protect the people of @entity8 and not be for regime change in @entity8 ? is n't the danger for the people of @entity111 ? " he added , " the president of the @entity5 did not define a clear goal			1
he did n't tell us what success is			0
he ca n't , because he 's contradicting himself			0
you know what success is ? success is removing @entity11			0
he just does n't want to say that			0
" @entity3 sen. @entity3 of @entity121 , a @entity123 favorite and possible 2012 presidential contender , said intervening in @entity8 is not in the national interest			0
in a response to the speech , posted on @entity129 , the freshman senator asked , " what imminent threat did @entity11 or @entity8 pose to the @entity5 ? " rep. @entity131 , @entity132 , the chairman of the @entity133 , said he was pleased with the president 's announcement that the @entity5 will transfer command of the mission to @entity138 on wednesday , and that the @entity5 will take a supporting role in the effort			1
" we can not afford another @entity142 or @entity143 , and i firmly believe that the president fully understands that , " he said			0
@entity131 added he does n't personally support the military engagement in @entity8 but understands @entity4 acted to prevent a " potential genocide " in the country			2
one congressman , rep. @entity149 , @entity150 , pointed out @entity4 made no mention of the cost of the mission , which both @entity154 and @entity3 have sought			1
@entity149 sent a letter to @entity4 last week asking for a full accounting of the @entity8 conflict and the pricetag and said the president 's speech monday night provided no answers			1
" i 'm concerned , and i know many @entity5 are concerned , that tonight we did n't get a clear and accurate accounting from the president on how much this conflict in @entity8 is going to cost @entity5 taxpayers , " @entity149 said in a statement after the speech			2
" we 've got two wars in @entity142 and @entity143 , and @entity5 deserve to hear from our president what this third conflict is going to cost us			2
" @entity149 said he plans to meet with defense secretary @entity173 and secretary of state @entity174 later this week and will press them on both the costs of the mission and " their strategy for moving forward in @entity8			0
" the @entity5 has already fired close to 200 @entity181 missiles in @entity8			0
the cost of that alone is between $ 250 million and $ 300 million			0
by some estimates , it costs about $ 10,000 an hour to keep a @entity5 fighter jet in the air , and @entity5 jets have flown nearly 1,000 sorties , many of which last five or six hours			0
some have estimated the costs of the @entity8 mission could reach $ 1 billion			0
sen. @entity195 , @entity196 , has also called for a full accounting of the costs			0
@entity31 took issue with those seeking clarification on the costs of the mission , saying the cost of not acting -- " instability forever " and large spikes in the price of oil for both the @entity5 and its allies -- is far greater			0
@entity1 's @entity209 , @entity210 , and @entity211 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity42 says he was satisfied with the president 's remarks
new : @entity131 says he is glad the @entity5 will play a supporting role
sen. @entity13 says the regime change remarks are " puzzling "
@entity97 says @entity4 made things " murkier than before "
