far be it for me to offer unsolicited advice to @entity3			1
she 's built a very successful career out of going rogue and certainly does n't need any tips from me			2
and , as an occasional pundit , a political influencer and a private citizen , she 's free to throw her weight behind anyone she wants			2
but i just have to say it : @entity15 ? really ? now , i 'm not in the camp of conservative elites who think she 's seen her best days and should politely retire to obscurity			1
if anything , the premiere of " @entity21 " on @entity22 on saturday is proof that she 's still relevant ; she 's got considerable influence over a certain wing of the party			2
and so with great power comes great responsibility			0
is @entity15 the most responsible pick ? of all the remaining candidates , in fact , the one that makes the least sense is @entity15			1
@entity36 could see , if she wanted to bring the party together			0
@entity38 could see for his social conservatism , strong @entity41 faith and similar family stories			0
i could even see @entity44 for his " throw the bums out " and " end the @entity47 " rogue - isms			0
but @entity15 ? when rumors first started swirling that @entity3 might back the former @entity50 speaker and self - appointed " cheerful " candidate , @entity15 was surging then			1
she said she 'd vote for him in @entity53 if she could			0
she wanted to keep the primary alive , she said			0
and , playing to @entity15 's strength at the time , she urged " more debates " and " more vetting of candidates			1
" but now , with @entity15 's ham - fisted campaign out of mojo , and no debates on the horizon , it would seem like a good time to jump off that train and get behind @entity67 or @entity68			1
instead , she doubled down tuesday , telling @entity69 that she voted for @entity70 in the @entity72 caucuses , where he finished dead last			0
and why ? " i have appreciated what he has stood for , " she said			0
" he has been the underdog in many of these primary races and these caucuses			0
" again , @entity3 's free to like any candidate she wants , and those would be valid arguments , if they were true			1
what @entity15 has stood for , both during his political career and during this campaign , sits in total contradiction to what @entity3 has stood for since becoming a public figure			1
she 's for small government ; he 's shown a disturbing penchant for big government solutions			2
she champions @entity95 outsiders and rails against the establishment ; he 's the epitome of establishment , and has been firmly encamped inside the @entity100 for decades			2
the very people who appreciate @entity3 should be the same people who despise @entity15			1
and he 's hardly been an " underdog			0
" with the backing of billionaire financier @entity104 and the benefit of serious name recognition , he 's enjoyed the money , media attention and opportunity that other @entity111 candidates did n't			2
if @entity15 's been an underdog , i 'm sure @entity114 and @entity115 would have been happy to switch places			1
the truth is , @entity15 is n't the " little guy " in any sense of the word			2
and if that were truly @entity3 's criteria , there are actual little guys , such as @entity125 and @entity126 to champion			1
or even better , she does n't have to support any of them			0
maybe @entity3 's got a master plan in which she makes a late run at the presidency and puts @entity15 on her ticket			1
still , it seems like an incongruous pick and waste of her considerable influence among far - right conservatives			0
but i 'm sure she knows what she 's doing .			0

@entity142 says she 's not one to *question* @entity3 's *instincts* , but @entity15 ?
she says *popular* @entity3 could be using her sway to support a more *viable* @entity111 candidate
she says many of @entity15 's *attributes* run *counter* to what @entity3 has said she stands for
@entity152 : if @entity3 has a plan that makes squandering support on @entity15 *logical* , it 's not *obvious*
