" just to clarify -- we did not release any information up to this point about the case because the crime was perpetrated within the family by a very close family member , " @entity27 wrote , putting the word " within " in italics			2
" there was no reason to believe there were any non-family members who had been victimized by the suspect			0
in addition , this victim is very fragile and we did want to jeopardize her welfare or the case in any way , " the chief wrote			0
the girl was taken captive in 1998 at age 13 , deputy district attorney @entity76 told @entity0			1
at the time , she was visiting @entity8 in his family 's home , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity81 and authorities			1
" in that home , she was basically , through the use of emotional and psychological pressure as well as sexual abuse , forced to participate in horrific acts for an extended period of time , " @entity76 said in a separate interview with @entity81			0
@entity8 's wife and children , who resided in the house , also lived in fear of @entity8 , authorities told @entity81			1
@entity8 built a shed in his backyard where most of the sexual abuse occurred , but it has since been torn down , authorities told the news outlet			1

one wall is decorated with a floral - print fabric , but another wall appears to be covered with white tarp			2
a wood column supporting the roof is next to the bed , as is a simple wooden table			0
the girl was n't allowed to attend school , and as she became older , @entity8 taught her how to do landscaping work , an activity they shared , authorities told the affiliate			1
in august 2012 , the victim was then a 27 - year - old woman , and after 14 years of captivity , she told others she wanted to escape			1
" on the last day , she said or she indicated that she was going to use the restroom , and had a relative waiting down the street , " @entity76 told the affiliate			0
" and at the time when she went to the restroom , she went down the street to a vehicle that was waiting and was able to get to the @entity130			0
" police lt. @entity131 said the victim appeared at the police department on august 16 , 2012 , " and wanted to report sexual abuse			2

" she did n't go to school so she , i mean , they were always together , she never had any friends , " @entity158 told the station			0
" i think it 's appalling , " @entity162 added			0
" you are supposed to be a @entity165 , but this is what you are doing to your child or whoever it is , even if it is not your child			0
i mean , you are doing this to a person ? no one has the right to do this to a person			0
" in his letter to the city council , the police chief said " this case is a good reminder that human slavery still exists			0
" " there are too many instances where terrible crimes can be perpetrated within families over long periods of time and victims , particularly more vulnerable individuals ( such a developmentally disabled folks , young people , etc. ) are unaware of how to get help or unable to do so , " the chief wrote			2
he credited officer @entity196 and detective @entity197 for playing " critical " roles in solving the crime			0
" although i ca n't get into all the details , it would have been so easy for them to have interacted with this victim and never figured out what was really going on , " the chief wrote			0
" their perceptiveness , empathy , and skills allowed us to save this young woman 's life and bring the perpetrator to justice ( if justice can really ever be served on someone who has done such heinous acts )			0
" @entity8 , who pleaded guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape , is now being held on $ 30 million bond , according to a detention facility in @entity225			1
