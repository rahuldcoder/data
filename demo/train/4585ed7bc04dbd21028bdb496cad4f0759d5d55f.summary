she is now one of @entity6 's most instantly recognizable faces and has won several accolades , including the 2005 @entity25 for @entity26			1
@entity0 's @entity27 caught up with @entity1 before her latest movie premiere in @entity29 to discuss fame and her passion for @entity2			1
an edited version of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : do you see yourself as an ambassador for your country ? @entity1 : as long as you are a celebrity and in the public eye , you are an ambassador because you are the person they see -- they ca n't see the whole continent , they ca n't see the whole country			1
@entity0 : how would you describe @entity2 to people who 've never been there ? @entity45 : @entity2 is a unique and a peculiar country , and as the people , we are too			2
@entity0 : why peculiar ? @entity45 : because everything , every aspect of human nature is in every @entity2 -- the good , the bad , the ugly , it 's just like another @entity52			1
@entity2 is fun , to be honest			2
but when ... all we have people talking about when it comes to @entity2 is crime and fraud and things ... that 's just a very very minute number of people			1
nigerians on the whole are very confident people			0
i believe we are confident , i believe we are very resourceful and we are very hospitable when it comes to visitors in the country			0
@entity0 : when you look at your country , what are some of the things that you love about it ? @entity45 : i like that as @entity2 we have some sort of neighborly love that we do n't understand			1
we have a way of coming to the rescue of complete strangers			0
we do have that bond and i think it has to do with our background and how we are raised ...			0
i would never live anywhere else to be honest , no. @entity0 : really ? @entity45 : no , i grew up in @entity83 , i was born and bred there and i do n't see myself leaving that town any time soon			1
i can work anywhere else but in terms of living , i 'm used to @entity83			2
@entity0 : how does it make you feel when people are screaming your name constantly ? @entity45 : you never get completely used to it , like the last time i was here for the other premiere -- " bursting out " -- it was pretty overwhelming			0
i just thought , is this my life , all these people actually loving and appreciating me for who i am ? it 's very humbling to be honest , i must say i 'm blessed			2
@entity0 : when did you realize that maybe this could be your future , this could be your career ? @entity45 : i do n't think i ever realized that , for a long time i kept thinking , ok , this is just temporary , definitely i 'm going to go back to school and read law , @entity107 or something that i wanted to do			0
so i never fully accepted acting as my profession			0
i do n't think i saw myself there but somehow ... here we are , i am an actor			0
@entity0 : do you ever get the feeling when you wake up in the morning one day that you wish you were n't famous ? @entity45 : oh yes , i do n't even need to wake up , just sitting down sometimes i 'm like , @entity114 , sometimes i hate my life			0
but i ca n't complain			0
@entity0 : you have been referred to as the @entity6 @entity8			1
when you hear that , what do you feel ? @entity45 : thanks to @entity120 ( @entity121 ) , it 's very , very flattering , i mean not just because i 'm compared to ( @entity8 ) but because of who compared me to her			1
so it 's an honor to be honest but i think it 's probably the vein we have on the forehead , i think that 's what we have in common			0
@entity0 : what do you wish for your future , where do you see yourself ? @entity45 : i want to be further challenged in my career , i do n't think i have reached my peak necessarily so i hope for other opportunities , greater opportunities to express myself			0
mostly because there is still something inside of me that i just feel i have n't let out and it 's really trying to come out and trying to burst loose so i 'm hoping for that opportunity ... i just want that story , that story that challenges me even further .			2
