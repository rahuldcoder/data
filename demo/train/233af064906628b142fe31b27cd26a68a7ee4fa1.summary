" when i was sleeping i had a knock on my door			0
i opened the door and two men were there			2
they gave me a pouch and said , " a gift for you			2

the next morning , she opened the pouch and saw a few " very small , dirty - looking stones			1

then , one of them added , " well , obviously they are diamonds			0
" @entity4 faces war crimes charges over a brutal conflict in @entity35 which was fueled by rough diamonds , also known as blood diamonds or conflict diamonds			1
prosecutors say @entity4 gave @entity1 a diamond during the war in @entity35 , contradicting @entity4 's testimony that he never handled the precious stones that fueled the conflict			1
the defense said it had n't seen a copy of @entity1 's testimony , which interferes with @entity4 's right to a fair trial			1
under tribunal rules , the defense team should get advance access to prosecution witness testimony so it can prepare its arguments			0
prosecutors said they have not obtained a statement from @entity1 , but they did provide a copy of her anticipated testimony to the defense			0
prosecutors had rested their case against @entity4 in february 2009 , but reopened it specifically to call @entity1 to testify after learning in june of that year that @entity4 had given the supermodel a diamond in @entity65 in 1997			1
prosecutors said they also wanted to call actress @entity68 and a witness named @entity70 to testify , court papers show			0
prosecutors have said that @entity68 confirmed that @entity4 gave @entity1 a diamond			1
when arguing to reopen the case , prosecutors said @entity1 's testimony would prove that the former president " used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases , " according to papers filed with the @entity81 - backed court			2
@entity1 did not want to be involved in the trial but was subpoenaed july 1			2
@entity4 , 62 , was president of @entity5 from 1997 to 2003			0
