-- @entity2 art collector @entity1 , whose nearly priceless collection was confiscated because it was suspected to contain pieces looted by the @entity5 , died tuesday and left the masterpieces to a @entity8 museum			1
one day after @entity1 's death at the age of 81 , the @entity9 announced that @entity1 had named it " his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir			1
" the news came as a surprise , the museum said wednesday , because @entity1 had never had any connection to it			1
the museum 's directors are delighted at the news , they said in a statement , but also recognize that there are outstanding legal and ethical questions surrounding the collection			0
@entity1 had undergone major heart surgery and was hospitalized for many weeks , his representative said in a statement			0
@entity1 grabbed the attention of the art world when @entity2 prosecutors seized more than 1,200 paintings from his @entity36 apartment in 2012 , including works by @entity38 and @entity39			1
the collection was confiscated as part of an investigation into tax fraud , but then it was thought that some of the paintings may have been works that were looted by the @entity5			1
just last month , part of the collection was returned to @entity1 as part of a deal with @entity2 's cultural authorities and the @entity52			1
under the agreement , works owned by @entity1 that were not under suspicion were returned to him			0
those suspected of being stolen were to be held securely while a task force investigates their provenance -- and will be returned to their original @entity59 owners or their descendants if a claim is proven			0
@entity1 's representative said that with the art collector 's death , the investigation into the collection ceases			2
the court that was handling the investigation proceedings will now function as an estate court in the case			0
among the staggering haul found in @entity1 's @entity36 , @entity72 , apartment in early 2012 were paintings by @entity38 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			0
@entity1 had said he never suspected that the collection he inherited from his father might include stolen artworks			2
thousands of pieces of art condemned as " degenerate " by the @entity5 were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s			2
other works were stolen from @entity59 families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country			0
@entity1 's father , @entity96 , who was part @entity59 , survived the war as one of only four " degenerate art " dealers permitted by @entity100 .			2
