a federal air marshal fired in 2006 for leaking information about air marshal travel cuts has won a victory before a federal court			1
the @entity5 on friday ordered the case of @entity7 returned to a federal board to determine whether @entity7 's disclosures deserve whistle - blower protection			1
" my smile is so wide it 's threatening my ears , " said @entity11 , a lawyer with the @entity12 who has represented @entity7			2
@entity11 said he is " chomping at the bit " to argue that @entity7 's leak was in the national interest , saying it may have helped prevent terrorist attacks on the @entity21			2
the @entity22 declined comment , saying it is reviewing the decision			1
@entity7 , now a resident of @entity25 , @entity26 , and a storm restoration contractor , said he hopes the decision will eventually lead to his return to the ranks of the @entity30 , which places armed , plain - clothes officers on commercial airplanes			1
the case began in july of 2003 , when @entity7 , then based in @entity34 , tipped off an @entity36 reporter that the @entity22 was suspending overnight missions just days after air marshals were briefed about a new " potential plot " to hijack @entity21 airliners			1
the agency planned the cutback -- which would have kept air marshals off most long - distance flights -- because it was running out of money at the end of the fiscal year			2
the news caused an immediate uproar on @entity49 , with sen. @entity50 , and then - senators @entity51 and @entity52 , among others , writing letters expressing concerns			0
the @entity22 retreated , killing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect			2
a year later , @entity7 appeared on " @entity58 " -- in disguise and identified only as " @entity30 ' @entity60 ' " -- to criticize the agency 's dress policy , which , he said , made it easier for terrorists to identify the undercover air marshals			2
but someone from the @entity22 recognized @entity7 's voice and the agency ordered an investigation into @entity7 for an " unauthorized media appearance			1
" during that investigation , @entity7 admitted he leaked the information to the media about the 2003 suspension of long - distance flights			1
the agency fired @entity7 in april of 2006 , saying his leak was an unauthorized disclosure of " @entity78 , " or @entity78			2
supporters argued that @entity7 brought to public light a @entity22 action that violated federal law , which mandates that the agency give priority to flights that present high security risks , specifically mentioning " nonstop , long distance flights			1
" they say the information he gave was factual and that it ultimately protected passengers by changing a flawed policy			0
@entity7 argued the information he disclosed was not @entity78 , saying the @entity22 sent the information as a text message on his cell phone , instead of as an encrypted message on his password - protected pager			1
and it was not labeled @entity78			0
@entity7 said his firing was retaliation for his union activities			0
but the @entity99 said that even if the scheduling directive was not labeled @entity78 , deployment information was " within the definition of @entity78			0
" @entity7 " admittedly knew that he was not permitted to tell anyone about ( air marshal ) scheduling , yet he did so anyway , and it could have created a significant security risk , " the board said			1
the board said there is " no direct evidence " the agency retaliated or discriminated against @entity7 for his union activities			0
on friday , the appeals court held that @entity7 had met the threshold of being eligible for whistle - blower protection			1
@entity7 must now demonstrate that he reasonably believed that his disclosures " evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety			0
" " frankly , that 's a hearing we would relish because there 's little question that his disclosures were worthy , " said @entity11			0
" numerous members of @entity123 attacked ( the travel cuts ) as betraying the department 's ( responsibilities )			0
the @entity127 said it was a mistake and canceled the orders less than 48 hours after his disclosure			0
they only corrected the mistake because of his disclosure			0
" @entity11 said the @entity22 has three options : appeal friday 's decision to the @entity137 , defend the original case before the @entity99 or settle with @entity7			1
if the government takes no action , the case will automatically be returned to the @entity99 for a hearing , he said .			0

air marshal @entity7 tipped the media off to a cutback in schedules
he was fired after the @entity22 found out he was the one who leaked the information
@entity7 appealed decision
he will try to get federal whistle - blower protection
