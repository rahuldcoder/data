it is our biggest enemy			2
" winter storm warnings stretched from @entity21 through @entity8 , parts of eastern @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity25 on tuesday			1
a separate ice storm warning extended from the @entity8 - @entity28 state line to just west of @entity29 , @entity30 , with forecasters warning of " potentially catastrophic " accumulations in @entity8			1
@entity34 will suspend some of its rail service in the @entity37 , @entity14 and @entity38 regions due to the winter storm forecast , the company said in a statement			1
at least five people have been killed in weather - related incidents , including three people who died when an ambulance driver lost control on an icy patch of road outside of @entity48 , @entity49 , according to the state 's @entity50			1
the ambulance slid off the roadway into a ditch , where it rolled over , caught fire and burned , the department 's spokesman , @entity52 , said			2
a patient , a paramedic and one other passenger were pronounced dead on scene , he said			1
in @entity64 , where the northern part of the state could see up to four inches of snow , authorities blamed two traffic deaths on the storm			1
residents of @entity71 , @entity72 , were looking at up to a foot of snow , while mountainous southwestern @entity25 could see up to 14 inches			2
roads were expected to ice up early , making them impassible			2
" if you get even a tenth of inch of ice on a road , it 's like a skating rink , " said @entity77 , a @entity78 meteorologist in @entity79			2
and in @entity8 , the state 's largest utility warned that hundreds of thousands of customers could be out of power " for days " when ice - laden tree limbs crash onto electric lines			1

@entity7 said his administration has brought in an additional 180 tons of salt and sand in an effort to keep roadways open , but he urged his citizens not to put themselves " in jeopardy or danger			0
" a ' very unpredictable ' storm deal and his fellow governors in @entity21 , @entity64 , @entity28 , both @entity24 and @entity25 issued emergency declarations ahead of the weather			1
in @entity72 , gov. @entity131 said the storm was " very unpredictable " as storm warnings were extended northward early tuesday , forcing state agencies to shift their footing to face the elements			1
" even within the last hour , we 're seeing changes in the weather predictions , which makes it very difficult to work on logistics , " @entity131 told reporters in @entity138			1

@entity78 forecaster @entity163 said the storm " certainly looks like it could be of historic proportions , especially in the last 10 to 20 years			1
" meteorologists will keep an eye across the @entity24 on tuesday evening as the temperatures there will largely dictate @entity114 's fate , he said			0
low temperatures are expected to sink southwest out of the @entity24 , so if the mercury drops precipitously there , it could mean trouble for @entity114 in the form of an inch of ice , he added			0
" you 've got to get right around 30 and ideally into the upper 20s ( for significant ice accumulation )			0
that certainly could happen with this system , " he said			0
" as for how much ice , that 's the uncertain part			0
" there is also a possibility of snow falling on the " backside of the system " thursday , which would further complicate matters , and once the ice starts melting , travel could be further hampered by chunks of ice breaking off overpasses , something that happened during the recent winter storm in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity163 said			1
" that 's going to create travel headaches as well , even after the storm is gone , " he said			1
travelers get another winter wallop a run on supplies as the skies turned heavy , @entity206 cleaned stores out of loaves of bread , gallons of milk , bundles of firewood and cans of beans and beer			0

and local leaders urged people to stay off the roads			0
" as of midnight tonight , wherever you are , you need to plan on staying there for a while , " @entity114 mayor @entity236 said tuesday afternoon			0
even before the first raindrops fell , @entity240 had decided to throw in the towel			0
" i will work from home and keep my kids home , too , " the software developer said			0
" it was not fun , especially with family members stranded for more than 24 hours in different places during the last storm			1
" @entity250 also opted for a similar strategy			0
" my wife and i decided a few days ago that we were going to get groceries early in the day , and we 're going to stay in , " he said			1
" we 're going to stick around for the next two or three days			1
" it took @entity250 more than seven hours to get from @entity256 near downtown @entity114 to his home in @entity258 , a northwest suburb , during the earlier storm			1

when the last storm struck two weeks ago in @entity8 , roads were gridlocked almost instantaneously as commuters fled @entity114 en masse			2
thousands of children across northern @entity8 spent the night in schools , and countless motorists endured commutes of more than 20 hours , if they were lucky enough to get home at all			0
