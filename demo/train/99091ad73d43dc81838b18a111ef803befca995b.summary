-- tragically , another celebrity has died after years of struggling with addiction , personal demons and multiple stints at rehab			1
country singer @entity7 's death is in the headlines , but similar tragedies happen every day and you never hear about them			1
take the case of @entity13 , who went to rehab at least 12 times for treatment of heroin addiction and whose family notified me last summer of his death from drug - related causes			1
@entity21 went to rehab five times before medical complications related to severe alcoholism took her life			0
and @entity26 died from a cocaine overdose after attending more than one famous rehab where she never received any professional psychological counseling for her troubled past			2
these are n't their real names , but sadly , they were real people			0
all these people desperately wanted to overcome their drug and alcohol problems and , like @entity7 , they sought help			2
they attended some of the most recognized facilities in the country , only to be offered the same type of treatment over and over and to have it suggested that something was wrong with them when treatment failed			0
just this week , @entity47 , who treated @entity7 on the third season of his show " @entity50 , " said in reaction to her death , " unfortunately , it seems that @entity7 did not sustain her treatment			1
" tv show hosts offered the typical platitudes : " stay in treatment ; treatment is effective ; please get help			0
" i 'll speculate that something else might have been going on with @entity7 , as it was for many of the more than 100 people i interviewed who had recently experienced the @entity68 addiction treatment system			1
i visited 15 addiction treatment programs across the country -- from celebrity rehabs to high - end 12 - step facilities to outpatient programs that treat indigent people			1
the stories i heard illustrate what some studies show to be shortcomings of our drug and alcohol treatment system -- that the approaches tend to be one - size - fits - all , even at expensive residential rehabs -- and that patients often receive very little individual counseling			1
instead , they participate in some form of group activity for around eight hours a day , not including meals , even though there is no evidence that group treatment is best for addiction recovery			2
some outpatient programs provide no one - on - one counseling at all			1
many said they were n't comfortable sharing problems with peers and could n't get sober until they found one - on - one treatment			1
although about seven out of 10 alcoholics who are encouraged to go to @entity101 during treatment drop out in less than a year , the 12 steps of @entity101 are included in some form in the great majority of addiction programs			1
research shows there are other ways to recover and many clients said @entity101 did n't work for them			0
still , they were n't told about other options , such as @entity113 or @entity114			0
@entity115 thought her relapse after her first treatment might have been prevented had she been told about @entity113			0
she found the organization on her own and said , " to sit in a room with others like me makes me feel less alone			0
" at @entity101 , if addicts relapse , they 're often told they must start over , losing their sober time , which can be a setup for a drug or alcohol binge rather than a fresh start			0
many programs are not using approaches that scientific studies find to be effective			0
for instance , only about two out of 10 programs use one of the @entity135 - approved medications for treating drinking problems , such as @entity137 or @entity138			2
and some prominent programs that treat opioid addictions , heroin or prescription painkillers such as @entity143 , refuse to send patients home with the very medications that can help keep them sober or " clean			0
" research shows these medications , such as @entity148 and methadone , are the most effective approach for opioid addiction , and that they both lower the death rate and the relapse rate			2
i have talked with people who had struggled for years and finally found an end to their drug obsession when they received such long - term treatment			1
a recent report in the journal @entity161 and @entity162 that analyzed dr. @entity47 's " @entity50 " found that " although many patients had histories of opioid use , there were no positive messages " about @entity148 or methadone -- in fact , the medications were portrayed as unacceptable treatment options			2
the authors believe that this further stigmatized methadone and @entity148 use and that many opportunities to provide science - based information were missed			0
for people to get well , treatment for psychological problems or " demons " must be integrated into care for addictions , and by qualified professionals			0
unfortunately , the standards for gaining the credentials to be addiction counselors , who provide most of the care at treatment programs , are woefully inadequate			1
according to a 2012 report by the @entity193 at @entity194 , 14 states do n't require licensing or certification of all counselors , only six states require a bachelor 's degree and just one requires a master 's degree to gain credentials			2
we 'll never know if another episode or type of treatment would have saved @entity7 , but we do know that , for a significant number of @entity68 , business - as - usual addiction treatment is n't working			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			0

@entity211 : tragedies similar to @entity7 's addiction and death happen often
@entity217 went to 15 rehab programs and found one - size - fits - all addiction treatment
she found lack of one - on - one counseling and no integrated mental health treatments
standards for certification of addiction counselors woefully inadequate
