-- @entity4 police officers can question stopped motorists about their immigration status , the state 's attorney general has said , adding fuel to a contentious debate over states ' immigration policies in the wake of a controversial law enacted in @entity13			1
" it is my opinion that @entity4 law enforcement officers , including conservation officers , may , like @entity13 police officers , inquire into the immigration status of persons stopped or arrested , " attorney general @entity14 writes in the opinion			1
" however , persons tasked with enforcing zoning laws lack the authority to investigate criminal violations of the law , including criminal violations of the immigration laws of the @entity30			1
" in " any legitimate police stop " -- for criminal or traffic reasons -- " law enforcement is allowed to ask about other subjects , " @entity14 told @entity0 's " @entity35 " on wednesday			1
" and our opinion addressed the fact that they can ask about illegal immigration , immigration status , along with anything else			1
" @entity14 issued the opinion friday at the request of @entity4 delegate @entity44 , a @entity45			1
he said he is obligated to issue such opinions when they are requested by lawmakers			0
" this is an outrage , and citizens rightly want officials to do something , " @entity44 told @entity0 affiliate @entity48 in a report posted on his website			0
" since @entity56 has taken this as a primary responsibility , they are primarily delinquent on this			0
" parts of @entity13 's immigration law took effect last week after a federal judge blocked portions of it following a challenge from the @entity68 administration			1
@entity30 district judge @entity69 issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a provision that would have required police to " make a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of a person stopped , detained or arrested " if the officer has a reasonable suspicion the person is in the @entity30 illegally			1
@entity13 officials have said the law was enacted because the federal government has failed to adequately enforce immigration law			2
@entity14 said wednesday the difference between the @entity13 provision and his opinion -- which does not carry the weight of law -- is that while @entity4 officers have the authority to inquire about immigration status , they are not required to do so			1
" we 're very sensitive to now allowing for racial profiling , " he said			0
" ... the way we avoid it is , we apply the same rules to everybody			0
and law enforcement is expected to do that			0
" asked whether his opinion means that stopped motorists must present documentation , @entity14 said , " well , the first response is simply whether or not they have to answer the questions			1
there 's not a requirement because a police officer is asking that you have documentation			1
" however , it is a requirement under our federal immigration law that those who are not citizens carry evidence , meaning their papers , indicating their legal status , " he said			1
" so if someone is not a citizen , they should have papers indicating their legal status			2
if they do not , they 're violating federal law , and that is a criminal violation			0
" if a police officer can determine someone is in the country illegally at the time of the stop , it provides grounds for arrest , he said			2
but one advocacy organization said actions like the opinion only serve to muddy the waters on the issue			2
" what we are seeing on the issue of immigration is a lot of political gamesmanship and very little in terms of solutions , " said @entity147 , director of immigration and national campaigns for the @entity149 , which describes itself as the largest @entity152 civil rights and advocacy organization in the @entity30			1
" given the situation in @entity13 , for any state or locality to continue pushing in that direction without at least figuring out if this is going to be ruled unconstitutional or not ... i think it 's irresponsible , " she said			2
while the issue should be addressed , " these kinds of antics are just distractions , " she said			1
those who are frustrated and believe the federal government has n't done enough should pressure the government to take action " as opposed to just adding more chaos , " she said			0
while @entity4 does not face the same situation as border states like @entity13 , the attorney general said , undocumented immigrants pose a " significant problem			1
" @entity14 said the federal government presents a " bottleneck			1
" " they are essentially in charge of whether someone is here legally or not			0
and if they refuse to undertake that , there 's nothing we can do as a state , " he said			2
if the state determines someone is in the country illegally , its options are to hold the person until the federal government retrieves them -- which is very expensive -- or let them go , he said			0
he pointed to a fatal crash on sunday , when a man believed to be under the influence of alcohol slammed head - on into a car carrying three nuns			0
sister @entity203 was killed instantly and the other two were seriously injured			0
the three were a few miles from the @entity206 in @entity207 , @entity4 , heading for their annual retreat			1
the suspect , @entity209 , had two previous convictions for driving under the influence , as well as reckless driving , speeding and public drunkenness , according to @entity216 prosecutor @entity215			0
@entity218 officials confirmed @entity209 had twice been in their custody			0
both times , he was released on his own recognizance pending deportation proceedings because he was not convicted of a violent felony			0
homeland security secretary @entity224 has ordered an immediate review of his deportation proceedings			0
@entity209 faces involuntary manslaughter charges in the crash			0
" this is a serious problem , " @entity14 said			1
" it threatens the safety of @entity232 , and i know the problem is similar across the country			0
we 're just taking gradual steps to address it as aggressively as we can			0
" when @entity0 's @entity238 pointed out that those in the country legally or citizens also drive under the influence and cause fatal accidents , @entity14 replied , " unfortunately , @entity218 had this person in their custody and let them go			1
they knew he was deportable			0
" @entity247 , executive director of the @entity248 , said @entity14 's opinion , while influential , likely wo n't change the way officers enforce the law , as they were never prohibited from asking about immigration status			1
the opinion is only an interpretation of the current law that police already operate under , she said			2
" i think what this says is , ' ok , @entity4 law enforcement , if you ask the question it 's not against the law , ' " she said			1
" we already knew that			0
" however , she said officers in general tend to take a " balanced approach " to asking such questions , lest they lose the trust of immigrants -- who are also victims of and witnesses to crimes , and whose cooperation can be beneficial			1
officers in some communities may ask the question less , while others may ask every time , she said			2
@entity281 , spokesman for the @entity283 - based @entity282 , said he does not believe the opinion will lead to racial profiling , because police officers use their own judgment when deciding what questions to ask and opinions to form			1
for instance , if a driver lacks a license , registration or insurance when pulled over , a police officer might have reasonable suspicion to ask about immigration status , he said			1
" these are legitimate concerns			0
police officers do have an obligation to look further when they find reasonable suspicion			1
" " every law is subject to potential abuse , " he said			0
" there are always going to be cops that go over the line			0
" mechanisms should be in place to discipline officers who go too far , he said , but laws can not be thrown out because of that risk			2
@entity14 's office pointed out in a statement that what an officer can and can not ask in an encounter remains the same , whether the concern is an immigration violation or a bank robbery			1
" the law does not distinguish between criminal violations of immigration law versus violations of any other criminal law , " the statement said			2
" but " when a police officer has ' reasonable articulable suspicion , ' the officer can briefly detain a suspect and investigate whether a crime has occurred , " the statement said			2
" if the officer has probable cause to believe a crime has occurred , the officer can make an arrest			0
these scenarios are true whether the crime is bank robbery , murder , trespass or criminal violations of immigration laws			2
the legal framework does not change just because the crime happens to be an immigration - related crime			2
" although immigration is politically controversial , the legal principles discussed in the opinion are a matter of settled law and do not break any new legal ground			0
" @entity0 's @entity353 and @entity354 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 's ag says motorists can be asked about immigration status
@entity14 says officers are not required to ask
an advocacy group says such " antics " are " distractions "
a police official says officers tend to be balanced in such inquiries
