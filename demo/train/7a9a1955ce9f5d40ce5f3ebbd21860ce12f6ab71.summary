@entity0 -- shortly before leaving the @entity3 in 1829 , @entity2 reportedly said , " there is nothing more pathetic in life than a former president			1
" ex-presidents @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity11 have stayed in the public eye since leaving office			1
if he had had a crystal ball , @entity2 might have tweaked that statement to say there is nothing more lucrative in life than to be a former president			2
last friday , we learned that the @entity21 have made a whopping $ 109 million since 2001			1
@entity11 has brought in almost $ 52 million from speeches generally going for $ 250,000 a pop. he earned somewhere in the ballpark of $ 15 million from his partnership with billionaire investor @entity26			1
and do n't forget the $ 15 million advance from his 2004 autobiography , " @entity29			1
" so much for the " sacrifice " of public service			2
but before bemoaning @entity11 's selling of the ex-presidency , a little historical perspective is in order			1
there 's nothing original about what the former president has done -- it 's just the magnitude of the proceeds			0
the precedent was set long before he said goodbye to the @entity45			0
@entity11 's immediate predecessors were n't too reluctant to use their stature to pad their bank accounts			1
@entity49 capitalized on his accidental 2Â½ years as chief executive by accepting positions on the boards of @entity53 and @entity54 , among others			0
@entity56 caused a stir when he netted $ 2 million dollars for a couple of 20 - minute speeches in @entity60 in 1989			1
@entity8 has held seats on a number of corporate boards and traveled extensively to deliver paid speeches			1
even @entity10 , who has by all accounts been a model ex-president through his globetrotting humanitarian work , has not been shy about accepting financial compensation for addressing audiences			0
some former presidents have been more loathe than others to cash in on the unique fame and honor that accompanies the highest office in the land			1
@entity75 wrote in his memoirs , " i could never lend myself to any transaction , however respectable , that would commercialize on the prestige and dignity of the office of the presidency			1
" impressive sentiments from a man whose only source of government support after leaving office in 1953 was , according to historian @entity87 , an @entity89 pension of $ 112.56 a month			1
historian @entity90 writes that the famously frugal @entity91 was so reluctant to cash in on his fame that he had name tags and tailor marks removed from old suits before reselling them			0
but do n't feel so bad for @entity91 his $ 3,000 - a - week column did n't hurt			2
neither did his acquisition of 8,000 preferred shares of @entity102 securities which , according to @entity90 , were priced below market value			0
apparently the definition of " cashing in " is in the eye of the beholder			0
if you 're looking for a role model from the bland , bearded roster of late 19th century ex-presidents , try @entity111			1
when his term expired in 1881 , he moved back to @entity113 and reportedly became a successful chicken farmer			1
@entity115 and @entity116 both returned to their legal careers after leaving office			1
@entity115 actually went to work for a foreign power , serving as lead counsel for the government of @entity123 during the arbitration of its boundary dispute with @entity127			0
( do n't tell me you 've never heard of the infamous @entity123 - @entity131 boundary arbitration of 1899			0
) then there 's the big loser of the ex-president 's club : the hapless @entity136			0
he decided to join his sons in a partnership in the @entity140 - based brokerage firm of @entity141			0
the firm was poorly run , and the northern hero of the @entity146 lost almost everything but the shirt on his back			0
a sympathetic @entity150 restored @entity136 's military pension , but the old general did n't restore his family 's financial position until penning his best - selling memoirs			2
sadly , @entity136 himself never got to enjoy the $ 450,000 in royalties generated by the publication of his memoirs			2
a lifelong cigar lover , he died of throat cancer less than a week after completing the text			0
perhaps @entity136 's brush with poverty was partly what inspired @entity167 icon @entity166 to propose , in november of 1912 , the establishment of a pension providing $ 25,000 annually to all ex-presidents and their widows			1
the object of the pension , according to a statement released by @entity175 at the time , was to ensure that former presidents " may spend their latter days devoting their unique knowledge gained of public affairs to the public good free from pecuniary cares			2
" generous man , that @entity175			0
adjusted for inflation , his offer translates to almost $ 550,000 today			2
@entity175 was willing to fund the pension himself -- a fact that was n't well received by his congressional critics			2
forty - six years later , @entity150 finally got around to establishing a publicly funded presidential pension			1
that pension is now worth $ 191,300 annually , with a bit more thrown in to support a former president 's office staff			1
it 's not quite as generous as @entity175 's proposal , but it 's not exactly poverty either			0
has the establishment of a pension freed our former presidents from their " pecuniary cares " ? not quite			2
but maybe we should n't act so surprised			0
after all , as they always like to remind us , our presidents are also our fellow @entity206			0
and at the end of the day , what is more @entity206 than making money ? e-mail to a friend			0
