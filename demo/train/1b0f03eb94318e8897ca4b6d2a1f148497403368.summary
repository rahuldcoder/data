-- this duck is named @entity2			1
he was born with a backwards left foot			0
@entity2 lives in @entity5 , @entity6 at the @entity7 , where owner @entity8 decided not only to amputate @entity2 's foot ( @entity8 says it would be too painful and prone to infections ) , but also to design a replacement foot as well			1
@entity8 used @entity2 's sister @entity13 's left foot as the basis for the design of @entity2 's new foot , which he modeled using 3d software			2
once the artificial mold was designed , @entity8 sent the design to a 3d - printing company called @entity22 , who printed out and donated a three - dimensional mold of the foot			0
that mold was used to create and test various silicone feet for @entity2 to try out on his non-footed leg			0
as @entity32 reports , " @entity2 , currently walking around on his stump , is due to get his new foot very soon , with the final design arriving in the next two weeks .			2
