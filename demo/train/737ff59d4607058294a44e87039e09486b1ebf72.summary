-- the original " pop - up restaurants " were secretive affairs			1
called " supper clubs , " they were hosted in private homes , the locations of which were revealed at the last minute via social media or guerrilla advertising			2
these underground gatherings of complete strangers were inspired by a love of food and seen as an act of rebellion against the established restaurant trade			1
are celebrity chefs stealing the show ? today , the idea is increasingly hijacked by celebrity chefs and big corporations			1
everyone from @entity23 to @entity24 to @entity25 are " popping up " in locations away from their home turf			1
exclusive and expensive pop - up dining clubs , membership for which can run into thousands of dollars , have also evolved out of the pop - up idea , to become part of the world 's high - end dining scene			1
the latest interpretation is from molecular gastronomy chef @entity38 , who 'll be transporting his three @entity41 - starred @entity40 restaurant from a village in @entity43 to a casino in @entity45 , @entity46 for six months in 2015			1
other celebrity chefs jumping the pop - up bandwagon include : @entity24 , head chef of @entity51 's @entity50 restaurant			1
he ran a pop - up at the swanky @entity54 hotel in @entity55 for 10 days			1
at nearly $ 330 a head , his menu featured dishes like live ants and flowers			0
opinion was divided about whether his restaurant , which focuses on locally foraged food , had traveled well			1
he braved accusations of selling out by creating a one - day pop - up restaurant in @entity55 to showcase ingredients from discount supermarket chain @entity68			1
@entity69 of @entity70 in @entity71 , who opened a two - month pop - up in june at @entity73 in @entity74			1
one of the most unusual pop - ups was on the @entity76			1
a capsule on the giant ferris wheel was transformed into a dining room with menus from the likes of @entity25 and @entity83 's @entity82			2
so are celebs and big money enterprises cashing in on and corrupting what should be an authentic , fun foodie experience ? or are pop - ups a natural training ground for future stars and novel dining experiences ? a sign of the times pop - up restaurants have their roots in @entity96 where illegal , privately owned eateries called paladares ( meaning palate ) sprang up after the @entity99			1
the trend spread to the @entity101 in the @entity102 and @entity55 in the @entity103 in the 2000s , run by foodies in their homes and unknown chefs in venues like disused warehouses or pubs			2
supper clubs gave the hosts a chance to experiment with cooking and guests loved the risque feel			2
a chance for rising chefs pop - ups offer rising chefs the chance to get their name known without all the investment and risk of opening a physical restaurant			1
many now - famous chefs cut their teeth on temporary restaurants			1
@entity127 of @entity128 in @entity129 previously ran @entity130 , a series of pop - ups across the city selling affordable , high - end food			1
@entity135 of @entity136 ran the @entity103 's first " guerilla " restaurant in a converted brewery in east @entity55 in 2006			2
pop - up pioneer and food blogger @entity140 , aka ms @entity142 , started one of the first supper clubs at her home in @entity55 in 2009			1
" i was cooking in various cafes and did n't have the money to start my own restaurant , " she says			2
" this was a way to cook without having to pay for premises and staff and without taking all the risks of opening a new restaurant			0
" her first event cost just $ 16 -- now she charges $ 67 for themed suppers and can cater for 20 people in her living room			0
" it 's good for tourism because people from abroad can come and eat in a @entity55 's home			0
it 's good value food cooked from scratch , which ca n't be said of many restaurants nowadays , " she adds			1
stealing the show " i 'm an original punk and i think there are parallels between the punk movement and supper clubs , " says @entity168			2
" punks hate all these bloated rock stars sitting in tax exile in their mansions and in a sense supper clubs were a reaction to bloated and overpriced restaurants			2
" @entity183 dining clubs and celebrity chefs are the antithesis of the pop - up movement , she believes			1
" what i find disappointing is there have been a lot of opportunists who do n't understand the roots of it , piling in with their big backers and marketing teams and pretending to do the same thing , and they 're not			0
" @entity197 side unlike some modern dining clubs , which require a big annual fee and a recommendation to become a member , the original supper clubs were open to an eclectic mix of people			1
@entity205 runs a @entity207 - themed supper club in her home in southwest @entity55			2
she saw @entity209 visit a @entity211 supper club on tv and thought she 'd try it			0
" one of the great things is that if you invite friends around for dinner you tend to spend time thinking about who would be a good combination of guests to invite , and on the night your attention is divided between hosting and cooking			0
" with a supper club you do n't have to worry about that			0
you can focus on the cooking and preparing the best food you can , " she says			0
" it 's been a great way of getting friends and acquaintances from different parts of your life to meet one another			0
the dynamic is unique , lively and informal -- it 's neither like a dinner party , nor like going to a restaurant			1
" exclusive club but supper clubs are becoming increasingly commercial enterprises			2
it has 1,000 members who pay $ 3,000 - 4,000 each for an annual membership offering access to monthly dinner parties in @entity211 , @entity129 and @entity55			2
@entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 are just some of the celebrities joining other personally vetted guests at her lavish events			0
" it 's good to have something for everyone			0
the pop - up scene has more variety in it nowadays especially in @entity96 , " she says			1
" some are bring your own , some are very foodie - orientated			0
i try to marry the food , chef and the people			0
the suppers are structured and organized but our members like that structure -- they ca n't just drop everything at a moment 's notice			0
" of course i 'm in it to make money but i genuinely love meeting new people and it 's a relationship thing -- you ca n't put a price on that			0
her role is to " curate " a dinner party , she says , similar to an art exhibition			0
she brings together different people			0
the only criteria is they must be " shining stars " in their field , whether surgeon or entrepreneur			0
testing food trends a different kind of pop - up club is @entity296 , which tests out cutting - edge food concepts in pop - up restaurants in 10 cities across the @entity102			1
the aim is to discover the latest food trends and offer undiscovered chefs the chance to experiment , says 20 - something ceo @entity304			1
it costs $ 100 - $ 175 to become a member and then $ 60 - $ 80 per event which includes food and alcohol , in venues ranging from helipads to piers			2
" for most chefs , the restaurant decides what they will be cooking			2
artists like having a free rein to be creative and we give them a platform to do it , " says @entity304			0
" we help them get out of the shadow of the head chef and hone in on which concepts could be a success			0
we 're trying to figure who and what 's next			0
" every course is rated by up to 120 guests , and the aim is to eventually open permanent restaurants using the research			0
" we 're experimenting in a way where we throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks , " says @entity304			0
" it allows people to try out experimental dishes in a very approachable way			0
" pop - ups are no different from any type of trend , it 's only a matter of time before it makes its way into big organizations who try to homogenize it			1
but i say , different strokes for different folks			0
" future it was always going to be hard for underground restaurants to stay underground forever			0
celebrity chefs and big business cashing in on the scene do n't seem to have dented the popularity of temporary restaurants ranging from home - cooked grub in someone 's living room to innovative cuisine in an aircraft hanger			1
expect the pop - up to keep popping up			1
@entity366 is a wine , food , culture and travel journalist based in @entity371 .			0
