he sustained serious injuries in the august 31 , 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident , threatening him to keep quiet			1
he said the caller told him to keep quiet , saying , " we know who you are , we know where you are , and we know where you live			0
" @entity11 said he did n't take the calls or letters seriously			1
a lawyer also asked @entity11 about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her , " if i remember , they 're going to kill me			2
" @entity11 said he did n't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark			2
@entity11 , who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye , told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash , which , he has said , was an accident			1
he has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the @entity51 in @entity52 , and that his next memory is more than a week later , in his hospital bed , when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead			0
@entity11 suffered major injuries to his lower jaw , the base of his brain , and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations , some of which @entity65 paid for			1
@entity11 also testified that he did not support the allegations by @entity18 's father , @entity65 , that @entity69 security services were behind the crash			1
he denied the security services paid him to change his story			0
at the time of the crash , @entity11 was working for @entity65 's security team and was assigned to guard @entity18			1
he was also protecting the princess because she was @entity18 's companion on the trip			1
he no longer works on @entity65 's security team			2
@entity11 has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down , largely because he does into support @entity65 's conspiracy theories about the crash			1
" i am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all , " @entity11 testified			0
" all i have ever done is given the truth as i see it			0
" in 2000 , @entity11 published a book , " the bodyguard 's story : @entity6 , the crash , and the @entity91 , " offering his account of the events surrounding the crash			1
he said @entity65 tried unsuccessfully to stop the book 's publication in @entity0			2
@entity11 told @entity2 he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew , but also to counter @entity65 's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident			1
@entity11 also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills			0
during the morning session , @entity11 testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash , but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories			2
in the first , @entity11 said , he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently @entity6 -- calling out , " @entity18 " from the back seat of the car			1
in the second flashback , @entity11 said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car			0
lawyer @entity117 then read from a letter written by @entity65 to @entity119 , who investigated the crash for the @entity69 police			2
in the letter , @entity65 says @entity11 is lying about losing his memory			2
" he knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress , " @entity65 wrote , alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot			2
@entity11 testified that he was not lying about his memory loss : " i have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel , that 's my last true memory			0
" @entity11 also said claims the couple visited a jeweler 's in @entity138 to buy an engagement ring in late august 1997 were untrue			0
@entity69 authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances			0
a judge , who is also called a coroner , holds hearings to determine how the person died , but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt			0
although @entity6 and @entity18 died in @entity52 , a @entity69 coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to @entity69			1
the inquest does not involve driver @entity19 because his body remained in @entity155			1
@entity69 authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after @entity155 authorities concluded their investigation , which lasted from august 1997 to late 2003			0
the inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that @entity69 police could do their own report , which was needed for the @entity69 inquest			0
the @entity69 police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in december 2006			0
the inquest then resumed in october 2007 and is expected to last four to six months			0
e-mail to a friend @entity2 's @entity164 contributed to this report .			0
