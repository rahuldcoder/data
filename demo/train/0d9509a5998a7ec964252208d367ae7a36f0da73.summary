sporting only the most stylish designer labels , wearing only meticulously matched colors , the @entity1 's dandies are the very embodiment of sartorial elegance			1
known as " @entity7 , " these dapper dressers are a @entity1 subculture devoted to the cult of style			1
in @entity12 and @entity13 -- the capitals of neighboring @entity1 and the @entity15 -- they stand out among the widespread poverty , strutting the streets like walking works of art. " it 's the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion , it 's their god , it 's powerful , " says @entity20 , author of " @entity21 , " who has extensively researched the @entity7			1
but for the @entity7 -- who are almost always men -- it 's not about what 's in vogue , it 's about style			1
the labels they covet most are those that evoke classic elegance			2
suits by @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 are all in demand , as are @entity46 labels @entity38 and @entity39 , says @entity20			2
when it comes to shoes , exclusive @entity49 label @entity47 and @entity53 label @entity51 's reign supreme			0
and imitations will not be tolerated			0
" you can lose your reputation if you are wearing imitation , " says @entity20			0
" that 's something blasphemous			0

@entity20 , who was born in the @entity1 and teaches history at @entity67 in the @entity68 , explains that @entity7 are n't rich ; they typically work menial jobs , and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel			1
in @entity12 , it 's common for @entity7 to rent or borrow clothes from fellow fops or requisition them from friends visiting from @entity78			1
as the @entity79 has spread , so have the @entity7			1
they can now be found in @entity78 capitals including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
@entity85 , 30 , was born and raised in @entity12 , but has lived in @entity82 since the age of 17			0
he 's infatuated with the classic cuts worn by the @entity53 aristocracy and can spend £ 1,000 a month on new shirts and jackets			0
" i am very passionate about clothing , i 'm passionate about colors and suits , " he says			0
" in the winter it 's anything to do with tweeds , in the summertime a nice blazer , a beautiful pair of jeans , a beautiful shirt			0
" i especially love @entity100 , one of the top designers in the @entity53 ... @entity100 suits start from around £ 600 and a bespoke made - to - measure will go out from £ 1,000 and upward			0
" @entity85 travels back to @entity12 in the summer and takes pride in showing off his very @entity53 attire			0
" in the summer holidays , everyone goes to show their outfits , " he says			0
" they all meet in one street or bars and they all show their colors or the label of their suits ... it 's up to people to judge and appreciate who 's dressed well			0
" once dressed in their finery , @entity12 's @entity7 will often head to " @entity122 , " a favorite bar , where they have informal contests			1
each tries to out sap each other with their combination of style , comportment and designer labels -- known as " griffes			2
" but @entity85 does n't consider himself a @entity7 , because he does n't dress up to compete with others			1
for him , it 's simply about taking pride in what you wear			2
" people from @entity1 love to dress up -- it 's something that 's in my blood , " he says			1
although every @entity7 has their own unique style , certain looks are especially popular			1
pastel - colored three - piece suits are a staple of the @entity7 ' fastidiously assembled ensembles			1
they are finished off with a tie , cravat or bow tie -- and the obligatory pocket square protruding from their immaculately tailored jackets			0
cigars and pipes -- lit or unlit -- are de rigueur			0
@entity156 photographer @entity155 stumbled across the @entity7 when he travelled to @entity12 in 2007			1
the next year he returned to photograph them , collecting his images in the book " @entity160			1
" he says individuals often belong to sub groups within the @entity7 culture , such as the @entity164 , who dress in @entity167 kilts			1
" one member has a sister in @entity167 who brings him kilts , " he explains			0
" they use and they adapt to their taste and individuality			0
they are masters of style , they create their own style			0

but @entity20 argues that being a @entity7 is n't just about vanity -- it 's a political statement			1
in the 1970s " authenticity " was part of the state ideology in the @entity15 -- a policy that prohibited the wearing of @entity190 suits			0
the @entity7 rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes , including leather suits , says @entity20			1
to this day @entity13 's @entity7 dress less conservatively than their suit - sporting @entity12 brethren			2
" the @entity7 is also about masculinity , politics , changing the stereotypes about how people view @entity200 , " says @entity20			2
" it 's about a lot of things , about beating the @entity204 at its own game , which is fashion : ' you colonized us but we dress better than you			0
' " @entity20 says the history of the @entity7 can be traced back to the 19th century , when the @entity1 was a @entity49 colony			1
some colonial masters would pay their servants in used clothes , and those servants would make a show of wearing their masters ' clothes on sundays			0
he adds that the phenomenon grew in the 1920s and 30s among @entity1 nationals living in @entity84 -- in particular @entity220 pioneer and anti-colonial activist @entity221			2
but it really took off after independence in 1960 , when ordinary @entity1 people would travel to @entity84 and return home wearing the latest fashions			2
in the 1970s , popular musician @entity227 , from the @entity15 ( formerly @entity15 ) , began promoting the idea of the @entity7 , forming the " @entity7 , " or @entity229 , of which many modern - day @entity7 claim membership			2
so what is the enduring appeal of the @entity7 ? " it 's politics , spiritual , aesthetic , social -- so many things , " says @entity20			2
" it 's a whole science -- they are artists			0

" @entity7 " are a @entity1 *sub-culture* of dapper dressers
