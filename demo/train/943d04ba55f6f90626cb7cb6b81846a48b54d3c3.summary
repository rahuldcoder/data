@entity0 , @entity1 -- we had not been in @entity0 in a month , not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage			1
the city seemed so upbeat when we arrived saturday morning on one of the first flights in since commercial airlines resumed service			2
musicians wearing @entity13 t - shirts greeted us near the hanger that now passes as baggage claim			1
next to our hotel , street vendors peddled souvenirs outside a tent city surrounding the presidential palace			2
but those optimistic signs were eclipsed sunday night when a torrent of rain poured down on this wounded city where outdoor tent communities have sprouted up in every empty space			1
then , just after 4:30 a.m. monday , an aftershock of magnitude 4.75 shook and shook and finally gave a last forceful jerk before stopping			2
you could hear the wails on the street , the confused voices of people arguing over whether to stay outside or risk going back in			1
this one - two punch of natural forces reverberated through the most vulnerable communities			1
full coverage of the aftermath of the earthquake in @entity1 @entity41 , 17 , raced into the main room of her home following the tremor			2
her parents direct the @entity46 , but the girls ' home is unstable , so @entity41 watches over the little ones at her house			2
" when is it going to end ? " she asked before spending her day coddling some very traumatized children			2
@entity54 , 4 , clung to @entity41 , shaking , acting out , sobbing for no good reason			2
the big quake on january 12 had rattled a cinder block wall in her play yard , crushing her leg , which now has a cherry red cast			1
the aftershock left her completely undone			0
all day , staff members of @entity63 surveyed the damage to their community			0
a tent city they helped build across from their school had puddles of water sitting in the " homes			0
" women ran up to the staff asking for food , new tarps and clean water for their children			0
the same scene unfolded in a nearby ravine whose inhabitants had attended a sunday morning service at @entity84			0
that day , women from the ravine had come escorting children who 'd been washed with soap and rain water			1
singing and laughing had filled the air			0
by monday , the heavy rain had soaked their tents where the " roofs " are made of scarves and sheets			1
the weather had become a great equalizer , reducing the people and the animals to the same conditions			1
in one alley , a father bundled a newborn with whatever he could find			0
in another , a dog cuddled her new puppies			0
baby goats foraged for food in the garbage			0
no one had eaten fresh food in a week , and the @entity117 staff brought baby formula and rice			0
people pushed aside the dogs , the goats and the chicks and neatly lined up			1
sad stories floated around the crowd			0
a woman who had attended the services had died after the aftershock , her heart suddenly seizing			0
a missionary worried aloud about a newborn wrapped in plastic whose parents had no formula for the baby 's first five days			1
the situation only worsened early tuesday			0
for the second time in as many days , an earthquake struck in the overnight hours			0
the magnitude 4.7 aftershock was centered about 20 miles west - southwest of @entity0			1
it hit at 1:26 a.m. tuesday , the @entity140 reported			0
a second smaller quake shook the area a few minutes later			1
no immediate reports of damage were made , but the aftershock sent frightened people once again out into the bug - filled night			1
when is this going to end ? it does n't seem like an answerable question			0
the rain swells the latrines and unearths the sewage			1
aftershocks rattle nerves and rearrange piles of debris			2
people sleeping outside now feel threatened by the rains , but sleeping inside carries the threat of the seemingly never - ending aftershocks			1
in the food line , the crowd was so quiet for people who looked hungry and faced a long wait			2
not much to say when a step forward is followed by a big leap back .			0

@entity2 's @entity169 and her crew return to @entity0 more than a month after quake
at first , they see signs of optimism among the people
a torrential rain and sharp aftershocks *quickly* squelch the new - found hope
misery continues to stalk people who are weary of *battling* nature 's harsh *realties*
