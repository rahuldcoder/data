-- are immigrants to the @entity2 more likely than the general @entity2 population to adopt tablet computers ? new research from @entity6 , a global mobile voip provider , indicates that this might be true			1
there are about 37 million foreign - born people living in the @entity2 according to the @entity12 , these first - generation immigrants represent about 12 % of the total @entity2 population			1
in november , @entity6 surveyed 1,340 immigrants residing in the @entity2 about their technology habits			1
in all , 13 % reported owning a tablet device , representing about 5 million people in the @entity2 two - thirds of these own @entity19 -- not surprising , since @entity21 's tablet has been around the longest and has the strongest global brand presence			1
in contrast , a recent @entity24 study found that only 5 % of @entity2 adults own a tablet			2
why the disparity ? part of this might be explained by how @entity6 defined " tablet			0
" in its study , this device category includes e-readers like @entity36 's @entity35			0
it 's true that some e-readers have some functionality that 's also seen in tablets ( especially the @entity41 , which can be hacked into an inexpensive @entity43 tablet )			0
but frankly it 's a major stretch to consider the @entity35 to be in the same device class as the @entity19			0
in fact , @entity24 's study differentiated between tablets and e-readers and found that another 5 % of @entity2 currently own an e-reader			0
so when you add @entity24 's tablet and e-reader percentages together , they 're not very far under @entity6 's estimate			0
still , @entity6 's research begs the question : if immigrants are more likely than the @entity2 population at large to buy tablets , why might that be ? @entity6 did not speculate on this			1
however , it occurs to me that many immigrants to the @entity2 come from countries where mobile technology proliferated faster and more profoundly than it did here			2
this might make immigrants more willing to adopt new mobile technology sooner			0
according to @entity6 , tablet ownership figures did vary by nation of origin : " @entity72 - @entity2 claim the highest percentage of tablet owners ( 17 % ) , followed by @entity75 ( 15 % ) , @entity76 - @entity2 , and @entity77 - @entity2 at 14 % respectively -- rounded out by @entity78 - @entity2 at eight percent and @entity79 at seven percent			1
" @entity6 also noted nation - of - origin differences regarding whether immigrants would purchase a tablet in the near future			2
immigrants from @entity77 ( 62 % ) and @entity85 ( 58 % ) were most likely to buy a tablet , while only 34 % of @entity72 @entity2 and 31 % of @entity78 - @entity2 indicated this intention			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity90 .			0

@entity6 surveyed 1,340 immigrants residing in the @entity2 about their technology habits
more than twice as many immigrants own tablet devices as @entity2 adult population at large
immigrants from @entity77 ( 62 % ) and @entity85 ( 58 % ) were most likely to buy a tablet
