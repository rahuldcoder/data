@entity1 , @entity0 -- a " black rain " of drilling fluid and a roar of escaping gas erupted from the doomed @entity5 shortly before the explosion that sank the oil rig , the captain of a nearby ship testified tuesday			1
@entity13 's supply vessel @entity14 was alongside @entity5 at the time of the blast			1
@entity13 said the first sign of trouble was when drilling " mud " -- a mixture used to pressurize and lubricate the drills -- began falling onto the stern of his ship			1
" we essentially closed the wheelhouse doors			0
i went to the port side , and i looked out up at the derrick			0
that 's when i see the mud coming out of the top of the derrick , " @entity13 told investigators tuesday			2
when he radioed the rig 's bridge , @entity13 said , its captain told him there were problems with the well and he should move his ship away			1
seconds later , he said , he heard " the percussion and the slight flash of green " of an explosion			2
@entity5 sank april 22 , two days after the explosion			1
the blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) of crude oil a day into the @entity54			1
@entity13 's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint @entity60 - @entity59 panel			1
his ship picked up the rig 's survivors , and @entity13 said the rig 's captain , @entity63 , told him he had tried to activate a " kill switch " that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure			1
the crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig , @entity13 told investigators			2
the federal @entity74 , the @entity59 agency that oversees offshore oil exploration , inspects drill rigs once a month , @entity74 inspector @entity73 told the panel			0
test results from the rig 's blowout preventer , a massive device meant to cut off the well in an emergency , and drilling mud weights are reviewed as part of that process , he said			1
@entity73 inspected the rig april 1 and found no violations , he testified			2
but he did not inspect the preventer 's emergency disconnect system , he said			0
the companies involved in the drilling process are blaming each other for the disaster			0
the chairman of well owner @entity96 's @entity97 subsidiary , @entity96 , told a @entity100 committee tuesday that rig owner / operator @entity101 was responsible for the rig 's operation and for testing its blowout preventer			2
but @entity101 ceo @entity105 told the @entity106 that the well 's cementing , or the casing that holds the well in place , must have failed			0
@entity96 , as the well 's owner , was responsible for designing the casing , while oilfield services contractor @entity115 performed the cementing			0
" without a failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred , " @entity105 said			0
and @entity115 's chief safety and environmental officer , @entity123 , told the committee that responsibility lay with either @entity101 or @entity96			0
during the cementing of the well , @entity115 simply followed @entity96 's instructions , he said , and the blowout preventer was @entity101 's responsibility .			0
