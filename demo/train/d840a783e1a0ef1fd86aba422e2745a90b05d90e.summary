-- as @entity4 @entity3 begin voting in the first primary of the south today , @entity2 insiders say that all the candidates have had their problems in @entity4 , one reason why today 's outcome has been so hard to predict			1
one veteran @entity4 @entity2 operative summed up the dilemma of many of his colleagues in the state who are still on the fence			2
" for the first time in my professional life i am not working for a candidate and undecided on whom i will vote for			0
my heart says one thing , my mind says another			0
" according to a @entity0 survey of 46 @entity4 @entity2 insiders -- including state legislators , state and local party officials , business and conservative interest group leaders , veterans of previous presidential primary campaigns , @entity2 political consultants , and other party activists -- former @entity29 gov. @entity28 's biggest hurdles in @entity4 are his @entity29 political roots and his more centrist views			1
former house speaker @entity41 calls @entity28 a " @entity29 moderate			0
" what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity28 in @entity4 ? his record in @entity29 -- 85 % his @entity47 faith -- 13 % his role at @entity49 -- 2 % now that @entity28 wants the @entity2 presidential nomination again , he has moved to the right from some of his positions and the tone of his previous campaigns in the state			1
and that has fed the perception that @entity28 is willing to change his stands for political expediency			0
ironically , @entity28 's continued defense of the @entity29 health care reform law he helped enact as governor remains a stumbling block with some conservatives who would rather he repent on that issue			2
" the two big issues that stick out to me regarding his record are his flip - flopping on abortion which many voters in @entity4 do n't understand , and of course his signing of ' romney - care , ' " said one @entity4 insider			2
" as a result , many do n't trust him and wonder if he will simply say anything in order to win the election			0
" and while @entity85 maintains that he 's the logical alternative for conservatives , the former house speaker 's problem has been that , up until thursday , there were two other options for @entity4 voters who were uneasy with @entity28 -- former @entity93 sen. @entity92 and @entity95 gov @entity94 , who has since suspended his campaign			1
however , the insiders do n't think @entity85 's personal issues have played as much of a factor , although they were surveyed before reports surfaced on january 19 that @entity85 's second wife said he asked her for an " open marriage			2
" what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity85 in @entity4 ? conservative vote is too divided among candidates -- 52 % attacks against @entity28 's role at @entity49 backfired -- 33 % the negative ads run against him -- 13 % personal baggage ( volunteered ) -- 2 % " @entity41 's populism resonates with red - meat voters in @entity4 , but the @entity116 ( has been ) too crowded for him to lock down a solid win here , " said one @entity2 insider			1
the other main contender for the fervent conservative vote in @entity4 has been @entity92 and he shares @entity85 's problem of being one of too many choice on the right			1
what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity92 in @entity4 ? his past record as senator on earmarks and right - to - work -- 41 % conservative vote is too divided among candidates -- 56 % doubts about him among @entity136 voters -- 2 % " the biggest obstacle for all the ' not - @entity28 ' candidates has been in a word , ' ego , ' " said one @entity137			1
" all of their egos were too big to drop out ( early ) and work to truly consolidate conservative voters			0
" but another operative noted that in a state where the @entity3 governor had battled with the @entity149 administration over whether @entity150 could move airplane production from assembly lines that were unionized in @entity153 to a nonunion facility in @entity4 , @entity92 's defense of his opposition to right - to - work laws while he was a senator has been " awkward , at best			2
" @entity95 rep. @entity159 's liability in @entity4 has been the same as in @entity161 and @entity162 € ” his isolationist views on foreign policy and his eagerness to cut military spending			1
what do you think has been the biggest obstacle for @entity159 in @entity4 ? his stance on national security -- 78 % he did n't spend enough time in the state -- 20 % perception that he ca n't win in the general election -- 2 % " because of this and other stands , no one takes him seriously outside of his hard - core supporters , " said one @entity137			1
the @entity0 @entity4 @entity2 insiders were surveyed on these questions from the evening of jan. 16 thru jan. 18			1
the survey was conducted over the internet			0
the @entity4 insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses			0
and while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns , two - thirds said they had neither endorsed nor were they working for any candidate in the race			0
here are the names of the participants in the survey : @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 .			0
