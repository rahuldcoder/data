@entity1 , @entity0 -- researchers in the @entity4 are buoyed by the results of a study which has determined that a giant grass could help the country to meet its steep biofuel targets			1
@entity10 amid @entity12 stalks found to outperform other biofuel sources			1
after successful long - term trials in @entity15 , a three - year field study of @entity12 x giganteus by the @entity18 has revealed that it outperforms traditional biofuel sources , producing more than twice the ethanol per acre than corn or switchgrass , using a quarter of the space			1
crop sciences professor and study leader dr. @entity10 told @entity2 that while there probably is n't one magic bullet to fix our climate woes , @entity12 -- also known as elephant grass -- promises to be one of five or six options that could help the @entity4 to reach its target of replacing 30 percent of gasoline use with biofuels by 2030			1
" i think it 's important in the biofuels debate that we do n't throw the baby out with the bath water			0
the idea we use the sun 's energy to grow plants and then make fuels from those plants is essentially a good one , " dr. @entity10 said			0
" it 's been tainted by the fact that the easy way to do it is to just use food crops , but society needs to realize there are big opportunities beyond food crops and beyond the use of crop land			0
" @entity12 , for instance , is able to grow on land too marginal for crop production , so it does n't have to compete with land for food crops			0
it also does n't require major input or fertilization after planting and once established will yield for around 15 years			0
yet even with the success of these trials in the @entity4 and the earlier @entity15 ones , it could be years before the full potential of @entity12 is realized			1
this is due in part to the fact that it 's much more complex to make cellulosic ethanol -- ethanol made from non-food plants -- than it is to turn simple food starches found in corn or wheat into ethanol			2
in the @entity85 , @entity12 is recognized by the @entity86 as an energy crop and it 's currently being used to co-fire the @entity89 power station in @entity0 's @entity90			1
even still , dr. @entity92 from the @entity85 's @entity93 said rather than plants like @entity12 , wheat grain will be used to meet the @entity85 target of replacing five percent of fuel with renewable sources by 2010			1
" @entity12 has the potential to be more efficient , producing between 4,000 and 7,000 liters of fuel per hectare , whereas ethanol made from wheat grain makes about 1900 liters per hectare			1
" " wheat grain - derived ethanol is what we can do today with the technology we have available today			0
the technology to use @entity12 is not yet commercially available , " dr. @entity92 told @entity2			0
in addition to the technical hitch , dr. @entity92 said a further downside is that even though @entity12 is a low maintenance crop , it can be costly to plant compared to wheat or rapeseed canola and the first yield would n't occur for at least three years			2
in an effort to overcome some of the challenges , dr. @entity10 now intends to turn his attention to experimenting with the wild @entity12 used in the @entity4 trial			2
and if the sort of improvements made to corn in the last 50 years are any indication , @entity12 could be well be used to fuel the future in a matter of years			2
is @entity12 the next big thing in biofuels ? sound off below .			0

a @entity4 study has revealed a giant grass outperforms other biofuel sources
@entity12 produces more than double the ethanol of corn per acre
it 's already used to co-fire the @entity89 power station in north @entity0
the full potential of @entity12 as a biofuel may take years to realize
