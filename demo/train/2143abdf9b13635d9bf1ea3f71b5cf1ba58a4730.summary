with elections scheduled for august , @entity1 's prime minister @entity0 needs this year to be better than the last			1
but just six months after the damaging @entity5 protests , the @entity1 government is now engulfed in a wide - ranging anti-corruption probe			2
police have so far detained more than 50 high - profile suspects , including the sons of three ministers , a real estate tycoon , a mayor and the chief executive of a major state bank			2
@entity0 has reacted furiously to the allegations , repeating accusations about an international conspiracy that seeks to undermine the stability of @entity1			1
hundreds of senior police officers have been sacked or reassigned and the prosecution team has been reshuffled to impede the course of the investigation			2
the prime minister has also removed four ministers tainted by the scandal from their posts and now seems to be laying the path for the retrial of military officers sentenced in coup plot cases known as @entity31 and @entity32			1

in reality , the allegations have less to do with justice and probity , and more to do with a clash of interests between @entity0 and @entity46 , a reclusive @entity48 - based @entity47 preacher and one - time @entity0 ally against the military and secular establishment			1
the @entity53 movement controls over a hundred schools worldwide , media assets , a bank and diverse businesses , and reputedly has many sympathisers in the judiciary , police and intelligence services			0
read more : @entity1 -- corruption or power struggle with cleric ? the timing of the corruption allegations is not coincidental			1
they come ahead of local elections in march , followed by presidential elections in august in which @entity0 plans to run			1
he needs to achieve an overwhelming victory in the march elections and , in particular , must win @entity73 and @entity74 to stamp his authority on the @entity1 general elections expected in june 2015			0
it is too early to tell whether @entity0 has suffered any loss of popularity			1
ultimately , his staying power will depend on the state of the @entity1 economy at the time of each respective election			2
the @entity0 - @entity53 trench war is defined by three factors that reflect broader developments			1
firstly , @entity0 comes from a @entity89 tradition , favoring pan-muslim solidarity and party politics			1
@entity46 , on the other hand , is an @entity94 group rooted in @entity1 nationalism and focused on social and religious activities			0
these differing traditions , unlike the experience in @entity99 countries , have ensured a functional separation and conflicting objectives between political @entity47 and @entity47 social movements			0
the conservative instincts in much of @entity1 society , such as an excessive respect for authority at the expense of individual rights , provide fertile ground for @entity47 groups to flourish and for conspiracy theories to take hold			2
according to a recent poll by @entity115 and @entity116 , two of @entity1 's leading sociologists , many @entity1 retain a rural and religious outlook rather than a modern urban perspective prevalent in thriving cities such as @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
in such a setting , personalities tend to trump rule - based institutions and governance , meritocracy is sacrificed for personal connections and interpersonal trust is seriously undermined			0
no wonder that the media coverage of the anti-corruption investigation has focused principally on two individuals and has ignored the concerns of the @entity1 public			0
' middle income trap ' this conservatism is a critical obstacle to the advancement of democracy and the future prosperity of the @entity1 economy and prevents the necessary political , economic and social reforms			0
in the absence of these reforms , a slow growth regime -- sometimes referred to as a " middle income trap " -- is taking hold			0
as i discussed in a recent @entity154 report , growth rates of 3 % or lower will become the norm rather than the exception			0
it is no surprise that the start of the @entity0 - @entity46 feud began in 2011 , when @entity1 's rapid growth rate was beginning its decline			1
whatever the outcome of the ongoing saga , the seeds of division have been implanted in the informal @entity47 coalition between @entity0 supporters and the @entity169			1
reconciliation , though possible , will be increasingly complicated by economic stagnation			0
political turmoil may be the outcome in the short - term , but perhaps it may presage the eventual transformation of @entity1 into a more robust and stable democracy as this turmoil encourages @entity1 toward more transparency and stronger institutions			1
