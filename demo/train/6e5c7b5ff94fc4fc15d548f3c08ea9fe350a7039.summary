-- it was n't until @entity3 's husband allegedly put a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her that she says she decided it was time to leave her abusive relationship			2
she could take her belongings and kids , but her dogs were a different story			0
dropping @entity12 and @entity13 , her @entity14 and @entity15 , at an animal shelter where they could be euthanized or adopted by another family was not an option			0
" i could n't give them up , " @entity3 said			0
" that would be like putting my children out in the cold , and i could n't do that			0
" @entity3 said whenever her husband threatened her , @entity12 would squeeze in the middle and try to push him away			2
her pets had protected her , and she could n't leave them behind to become victims of her husband 's wrath			1
so she called @entity32 , which placed the dogs with foster families until @entity3 got settled in a new home			1
@entity3 's husband later pleaded no contest to charges of simple assualt and battery			0
@entity32 -- which stands for " nonviolence " in @entity42 -- is the only animal shelter in @entity44 that specifically cares for pets from homes of domestic violence			1
in the last year , dogs , cats , birds , reptiles , livestock and horses took refuge for a combined total of 20,000 nights			0
in one case , the shelter took in 18 chickens			2
the @entity61 shelter will house a pet for as long as the owner needs			1
every animal also receives a medical examination from a veterinarian			0
as @entity32 executive director @entity71 explained , pets in households with an incidence of domestic violence often have hidden injuries themselves			1
" abusers tend to be very good with their human victims in knowing exactly where to hit so that the bruises do n't show -- so she can put on a long sleeve shirt or some makeup and cover them -- and to some extent , they also do that with animals , " she said			2
domestic violence against women : recognize patterns , seek help perpetrators of domestic violence often harm or threaten a family pet in order to manipulate a partner and coerce him or her to stay in a relationship			1
as a result , 18 % to 45 % of battered women remain with their abuser in fear of what he may do to a pet or livestock upon leaving , according to a study by the @entity103			1
@entity104 , an advocate against domestic violence who alleges a close relative abused her and their dog @entity111 , explained that abusers realize pets provide a type of comfort for victims and use that to their advantage			1
" the abuser will often make threats and say , ' if you leave i 'll kill @entity121 , or i 'll flush the goldfish down the toilet ' -- whatever it is that will make that person stay in that relationship , " she said			2
@entity111 was considered a part of the family to @entity104 and her three kids			0
when it became clear she was giving more attention to the dog , @entity104 says the relative got jealous and abused @entity111 as a way to take control			2
" he would hit him , kick him , sometimes choke him , " @entity104 recalls			0
" he would tell us that we could n't see @entity111			0
" the relative was never charged for abusing @entity111 or @entity104			0
in every state , pets are considered property under the law , and judges can not order a person to not harm , injure or interfere with the care of a family pet			1
but that is changing as 21 states plus the @entity150 and @entity151 have enacted laws to include pets in domestic violence protection orders			1
@entity155 : when you have to give your pet away @entity158 is the most recent state to pass a bill that will punish family violence perpetrators under protective orders who torture pets			1
@entity165 @entity158 state sen. @entity164 , who sponsored the bill that will go into effect september 1 , said the legislation provides the opportunity for law enforcement to bring federal prosecution against abusive partners who threaten pets			2
protective orders protect women against further abuse by a partner , but the same does n't hold true for pets , @entity175 explained			1
now that pets are included in orders , abusers will receive a misdemeanor for the first violation and felony charges upon two or more violations			1
every day , thousands of pets and humans are at risk in abusive relationships , according to @entity192 , coordinator of the @entity193 , which seeks to prevent violence toward people and animals			2
a study by the @entity198 found that 71 % of women entering shelters report that their batterer had injured , killed or threatened a pet to exert control over them			1
for many women , fleeing with their dog or cat is n't an option when only one in eight domestic violence shelters accept pets , according to the @entity198			1
the @entity213 in @entity158 recognized this problem and started @entity215 -- a program to provide temporary boarding , medical care and food for pets of families escaping domestic violence			1
this year , the program cared for 20 pets , but the organization investigated 14,642 cases of animal abuse , neglect and cruelty in 2010 , according to @entity213 spokeswoman @entity229			2
tips for adopting the best shelter dog in the past few years , state representatives have been debating bills that would include pets in domestic violence protective orders			1
@entity236 , a law professor of animal cruelty at @entity238 , said the majority of these bills eventually pass because " everybody can agree with the principle			0
" " who 's going to stand up and say , ' no , the husband should be able to abuse the pet ' ? " he said			2
however , @entity236 explained adding pets in protective order laws may not be effective since pet abusers already violate the state 's animal cruelty law			1
" if a man wants to inflict harm , he 's not going to really be stopped by this protective order , " he said			0
but after hearing stories -- in one case , a man cut off a dog 's ears and sent them to his partner to get her to return -- @entity175 says she believes the new law will help keep women safe			2
" the bill is n't about protecting the pet nearly as much as it is about protecting women , who unfortunately can be convinced to say in an abusive situation where a pet is used as basically a pawn against her emotions , " she said			2
domestic violence against men : know the signs what to do if your pet is being abused : 1 ) first , if he 's threatening the pets , you are next			1
do n't assume that he 's bluffing			0
do n't think things will get better			0
they wo n't , says @entity192 , coordinator of the @entity193			0
the lives of you and your children are in danger			0
get out -- now ! 2 ) avoid bitter custody battles by making sure all of your pet 's records are in your name : rabies and other shots , pet food purchases , dog or cat licenses , pedigree papers , receipts for vet bills , etc. these should all be in your name to establish that you are the caregiver			0
3 ) make sure your pets are current on all their licenses and vaccinations			0
this makes it easier to house them in an emergency shelter			0
4 ) pets should have an identification tag that does not have your name or home number			0
use the number of a friend or the animal 's veterinarian			0
5 ) have an emergency plan that includes your pets			0
if you 're able to prepare for your pet 's departure , try to have pet items -- including vaccination and medical records , medications , licenses , blankets , leashes , collars and pet carriers -- in a safe place where your abuser wo n't be able to find them			1
6 ) have a safe place for your pet lined up in advance such as a women 's shelter that offers on - site housing or off - site foster care for pets , a trusted friend , veterinarian , kennel or animal shelter			1
keep this location secret in case your abuser tries to take control of the pet in order to take control of you and your children .			1
