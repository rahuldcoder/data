polls closed sunday after voters streamed into polling stations in eastern @entity4 to vote in controversial referendums held by @entity7 activists eager to declare independence from @entity9 , an official said			1
voters in the city of @entity12 faced this question on the ballot : " do you support the @entity16 of @entity12 ? " the options are " yes " or " no. " a similar question is being put to voters in @entity21			2
many of the voters were not on the outdated registration lists but were allowed to vote after showing identification documents			1
there also seemed to be no system in place to prevent one person from voting at multiple polling stations			1
a @entity32 crew saw several people vote twice at one polling station , where the ballot boxes were decorated with new @entity12 independence flags			1
there was also a report of video showing three men arrested near @entity41 with boxes of " yes " ballots in their car			2
but in a sunday afternoon news conference , the head of the @entity46 of @entity47 , @entity48 , disputed reports that people were voting twice in some areas			1
@entity53 said the lines were so long that many people had a hard time voting once , let alone twice			1
he also denied the report about ballot fraud			1
@entity48 said there was no reason for @entity7 activists to cheat because voter turnout was so high			1
the polls were told to stay open for 14 hours , rather than the usual 12 , to allow time to add people to the voter list if necessary , the election committee said , adding that access to the most recent electoral rolls has been barred by @entity9			1
@entity48 was the official to announce that polls had closed			1
two incidents heightened tensions at polling places sunday			1
rubber bullets were fired into the air at a station in @entity12 , said election committee member @entity78			1
@entity78 also said police in @entity80 tried to prevent people from voting			1
the central government in @entity9 has declared the polls illegal			1
@entity85 's mixed messages the message coming from @entity87 on the referendum appears mixed			2
@entity85 police officers oversaw voting at a @entity87 polling station erected for expat @entity4 to vote in the @entity12 and @entity21 referendums			1
but last week , @entity85 president @entity92 also urged the @entity7 sympathizers to delay the referendum to give dialogue " the conditions it needs to have a chance			2
" @entity92 's unexpected call appears to have dented the confidence of some @entity7 activists			2
however , representatives of the @entity7 groups in @entity12 and @entity21 voted to go ahead with it			2
meanwhile , in @entity41 , a @entity85 government - controlled tv channel was periodically showing a banner along the bottom of the screen that told viewers where they can vote in sunday 's referendum			1
that channel , @entity85 24 , is available over the air to residents of @entity12 , who can access it in their homes			2
the banner listed the location and voting hours and advised voters to bring a passport			2
the banner was shown only on the @entity85 24 channel , not on other channels			0
blood and balaclavas a vote for autonomy is a vote for the self - destruction of the east , @entity4 's acting president @entity123 has said			2
it would cut residents off from the national economy and social programs , he said			0
" it is a step [ to ] nowhere for these regions			0
it is euphoria that may lead to very complex consequences , and many people can already feel them			0
" they have felt the pain in bloodshed , at graves and in burned - out ruins still smoldering in the east , where ethnic @entity85 militiamen have battled @entity4 security forces			0
at least seven people were killed and 39 others were injured friday in the southeastern city of @entity150 , regional sources said			0
the electoral commission office in @entity12 was ringed with sandbags and barbed wire on saturday			0
men in balaclavas lounged outside tents pitched nearby , looking relaxed			0
they wore the orange - and - black @entity158 ribbon , which has become a symbol of the @entity7 separatists			0
a dozen men lined up in front of the regional administration building to sign up for " military service " with the @entity165			0
they showed their @entity167 documents and registered at a small tent			0
deadly clashes have also stained @entity150 and @entity170 , as well as @entity41 , where separatists hold key government buildings and remain in a standoff with @entity4 military forces			0
militants have erected concrete barricades on the roads into town there			0
' illegitimate ' vote if the referendum passes , it would offer a stark contrast to recent polling by the @entity184 , which found 70 % of people in eastern @entity4 want the country to remain united			1
@entity48 said sunday that if voters agree to secede from @entity4 , the next logical step is another referendum in the next several months on joining @entity85			0
whatever the outcome , the vote has already been condemned as illegitimate by several @entity193 powers			1
@entity195 chancellor @entity194 said saturday , " we consider the referendum ... illegitimate and focus on the ( presidential ) election on may 25 in the entire @entity4			1
" the interim government in @entity9 , which took power after ousted @entity203 president @entity202 fled to @entity85 in february , is due to hold presidential elections may 25			1
@entity85 meddling ? @entity194 and @entity207 president @entity206 have warned that @entity85 could face consequences if the presidential vote does not go ahead as planned			2
" if no internationally recognized presidential election were to take place , this would inevitably further destabilize the country , " @entity194 said			2
in that case , she said , " we are ready to take further sanctions against @entity85			0
" @entity194 and @entity206 also said that @entity85 troops along the @entity4 border " should undertake visible steps to reduce their readiness			0
" @entity92 announced a troop pullback wednesday , but @entity222 says it has seen no signs of a withdrawal of @entity85 forces from the border area			0
@entity85 annexed the southern region of @entity228 after announced results in a separatist referendum showed more than 90 % in favor of joining @entity85			1
in an independent @entity184 survey , 54 % of @entity228 residents showed support for secession			0
the @entity236 has said that it has no interest in annexing other parts of @entity4			0
but it is pushing for the country to adopt a constitution that would give regions where @entity85 is widely spoken a larger voice in policy - making			0
critics fear that the creation of autonomous @entity7 regions in @entity4 would cement alliances with the @entity236 that would give it essential control over them			0
@entity4 separatists vow to go ahead with controversial referendum			0
