@entity1 's prime minister @entity0 is betting that the snap elections that he has called this month will bolster support for the sweeping economic reforms he has introduced since taking power in 2012			1
but if the gripes of small business owners like vegetable seller @entity8 are any gauge , @entity0 will have his work cut out			0
@entity8 has turned off some of the lights in his @entity14 store to save on electricity after his bills rose 30 % in a year , and he says his customers are in no mood to spend			0
" the money will trickle down from big corporations , according to prime minister @entity0 , " he says			0
" where is it ? it has not reached to the people who work hard every day on the ground			0
" economic woes @entity0 is painting the december 14 election as a referendum on his economic policies , the much - vaunted " three arrows " of " @entity32 , " the stimulus and economic reform package upon which the leader has staked his reputation			1
an unexpected dip into recession has dealt his flagship economic policies a blow , however , prompting the snap election			1
almost half of voters polled for two recent opinion surveys said that the economy and jobs were the main issues for them			2
" the election will be held to ask the public whether we will ( move ) forward with @entity32 or end it , " @entity0 said when announcing the closure of parliament			1
campaigning for the 475 seats of the lower house of parliament that are up for grabs starts on tuesday and polls put support for the ruling @entity59 ( @entity59 ) around 30 % , and between 10 % and 13 % for the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , the main opposition party			0
the @entity59 has been enormously successful in the postwar years , essentially having remained in power since 1955			2
during this period , the @entity60 have only governed twice , briefly in the 1990s and again from 2009 to 2012			0
strange timing an election was n't required until late 2016 , which has led to considerable speculation as to why @entity0 , with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early			2
@entity73 @entity72 , analyst and founder of @entity75 , a @entity76 - based government policy consultancy , told @entity77 he found the timing " puzzling			0
" " why call an election when you have such a dominant position ? " indeed , polls suggest that a majority of the public do n't understand why @entity0 is calling an election at this time , and are critical of the cost during another period of recession			2
voter turnout is expected to be low			0
" there is a mental malaise in @entity1 which is responsible for the economic malaise ( of the post-economic bubble years ) , " @entity72 said			1
one rationale for the election is that @entity0 is simply consolidating his position before " news gets worse , " says @entity97 , director of @entity98 at @entity99			0
the opposition is weak , and in disarray , he says , and now is an ideal opportunity to " lock in a two year extension " to the prime minister 's majority in the @entity1 's parliament			1
" there 's no great time ( to hold an election ) , " @entity97 told @entity77			2
" this is the least - worst time			0
" @entity111 : @entity1 voters to give verdict on @entity32 place in the world while the election is being framed largely in economic terms , @entity1 voters have plenty of other concerns , including the country 's energy policy			1
the ruling party is in favor of restarting the country 's nuclear reactors -- which were mothballed in the wake of the @entity127 nuclear disaster			0
local city assemblymen voted in october to fire up two reactors at the @entity131 power plant in @entity132 in @entity1 's south			1
and @entity1 are reflecting on their place in the world after @entity0 earlier this year issued a re-interpretation of @entity1 's pacifist constitution to allow for a greater degree of self - defence			1
hardline approaches toward @entity141 traditionally appeal to @entity1 's voters , and tensions over maritime territorial disputes with neighbor @entity141 have intensified in recent years			1
the role of women in public and corporate life is also under scrutiny			0
the @entity150 , a conservative newspaper , estimates that only 184 female candidates will run in the december 14 election , about 16 % of the total			1
@entity0 says that he has long championed women in the workplace , but as traditions die hard in conservative @entity1 , the number of married women with children and jobs remains low			2
@entity161 ultimately , @entity0 's election gamble will only pay off if he can convince the average salaryman or woman that his economic policies will benefit ordinary @entity1			1
while a key component of @entity32 has been extra government spending , a sales tax hike this year and rising costs have taken their toll on small businesses and their customers			2
in a bit to boost his election fortunes , @entity0 delayed a sales tax hike planned for october 2015			0
his special adviser on economic affairs @entity176 , has called for a further $ 25 billion in cash handouts and tax cuts to kickstart the economy			0
but it 's not clear whether this will be enough to satisfy voters			2
" @entity32 is no good at all , " said @entity184 , the fourth - generation owner of a 100 year - old tofu shop owner in @entity76 , who is finding recent economic conditions a threat to his livelihood			1
" our life is getting tough			0
" watch : @entity1 delays tax hike and calls for election read more : @entity1 profile : tradition , innovation and 21st century			1

@entity1 's @entity200 calls snap election for december 14
he 's framing the election as a referendum on his much - vaunted ' @entity32 ' economic policies
analysts suggest he may be *shoring* up power
other issues are *important* to @entity1 voters , but may not get much play in this election
