@entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 is a ghost town			1
once a bustling railroad hub , its streets are normally empty			1
the remaining people only come out to board a bus or car that will carry them to safety , or when relief workers arrive to hand out rice , pasta , canned foods and other supplies			1
the @entity1 crisis : everything you need to know bundled up against the raw winter weather , they line up to receive rations and scurry back inside their homes , hoping they wo n't be killed by the near - constant shelling			1
this strategically located town in eastern @entity1 is one more casualty of the fighting that has intensified in recent weeks between @entity31 separatists and @entity1 forces			1
separatists are trying to encircle the town while government forces maintain posts on the outskirts			2
a spokesman for the government 's military operation , @entity41 , said the militants were consistently shelling @entity0 -- and that it 's currently the most dangerous place in the country			1
" the city infrastructure is increasingly devastated , " he said			2
" @entity1 armed forces are holding their lines of defense and are not going to leave their positions			1
" only 3,000 to 4,000 of @entity0 's 25,000 residents remain			1
most have fled to safer places			2
at least 224 were killed and more than 540 others injured in the final three weeks of january , the @entity54 high commissioner for human rights said last week			2
the numbers may actually be higher			2
who 's left ? most of them are elderly with no family to take them in			1
some seniors are so old they remember the horrors of @entity64 , such as a woman who stayed inside her apartment for two weeks , simply lying on her bed			2
children are few and far between			0
their families have moved them to safety			0
" we do n't care about @entity72 , " one woman said			0
" we want to live regular lives			0
" about one third of the houses have been hit by artillery			0
dozens of people huddle in dank underground bunkers and sleep on cots and old beds carried in			1
piles of sandbags protect the entrances to the bunkers			0
others , like a group sticking it out in an old apartment building , are elderly but vehemently pro-russian			0
" we 're just waiting for the @entity72 to come in and liberate us , " one said			0
scenes of exhaustion are everywhere			0
while people mill around the @entity96 lobby , an old woman wraps herself in a quilt and stretches out on three side - by - side chairs to sleep			1
most @entity0 residents have fled to government - controlled towns , but leaving is risky			1
shells rain on @entity0 at all hours			1
the people who are left do n't have transportation of their own			2
they collect their belongings in suitcases and plastic bags and gather at the train station or the city center			0
they wait for for cars , small buses or full - sized buses driven by relief workers to arrive and carry them to safe havens			0
they stare ahead blankly or break into tears while standing on the pavement			0
once they 're in a car or on the bus , danger still lurks			0
the road leading out of the battle zone into the closest safe town , @entity125 , is often shelled by separatist forces			0
and once they reach a shelter , they wait , wondering if they 'll ever be able to return to their home			0
