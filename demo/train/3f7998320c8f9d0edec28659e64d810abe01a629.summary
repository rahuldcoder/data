-- the stakes are high this november , for the strength of our economy and the direction of our country			1
for me , like a lot of us , the stakes are also personal : the choice i make in the voting booth will significantly affect my friends , my loved ones and my generation			2
like many millennials , i am concerned about the job market and costs of college			0
and i 'm worried about access to affordable health care for all			0
but i could never have predicted just how intensely personal this election would become			2
when i was publicly attacked for testifying before members of @entity25 , i became even more keenly aware that the rights that generations of women fought so hard to achieve could be rolled back easily			1
that began a national conversation that i believe highlighted president @entity31 and former gov. @entity33 's vastly different values and visions			1
@entity31 is committed to rebuilding our economy upon the values of fairness and opportunity and the belief that all @entity41 , both men and women , must have the rights they deserve			1
that 's why i 'm proud to endorse his re-election			0
he 's demonstrated those values since he moved into the @entity47			2
the first law he signed was the @entity50 , which empowers women to challenge pay discrimination in the workplace			0
he 's now asking @entity25 to pass the @entity55 to help stop pay discrimination before it starts and close the 23 % gap between women 's earnings and men 's earnings			1
@entity31 also made college more affordable by doubling our investment in @entity65 scholarships , giving students tuition tax breaks and by fighting to keep interest rates low on student loans			2
he 's helping millions of students graduate without the weight of unbearable loans and financial insecurity			0
most importantly , @entity74 is providing vital health coverage for millions of @entity41 , especially women and families			0
when the reforms are fully in effect , we will no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition or charged more for insurance because we are women			0
we will finally have affordable access to preventive care , such as prenatal exams , cancer screenings and contraception			0
health reform makes real the fair premise that our access to basic health care should n't depend on where we work , where we go to school or what gender we are			0
opinion : slurs wo n't silence women @entity31 has moved our country forward by working not only to ensure @entity41 ' prosperity , but also by guaranteeing that our rights are protected and we all have opportunities to succeed			1
by comparison , @entity33 has offered only frightening promises to send us backward			2
on fair pay for women , @entity33 says he wo n't do anything to make the situation worse ; this is little comfort when he then says he wo n't do anything to make it better			1
he wo n't tell us whether he would have signed the @entity114 law , and he failed to stand up to congressional @entity115 who opposed the @entity55			0
@entity33 would cut his own taxes , but make college more expensive for young people just getting on their feet			2
those are n't the values we want in a president -- and they 're a stark contrast to @entity31 , who would raise his own taxes and keep cutting them for the middle class			1
@entity33 would allow the college tax credit expire for millions of middle - class families and embraced the congressional @entity115 budget that would let student loan interest rates double			1
instead of explaining how he would improve @entity41 ' access to health care , @entity33 says only that he would " repeal @entity74 " and " kill it dead on its first day			2
" in practical terms , that means @entity33 would strip health care coverage from the more than 6.6 million young @entity41 who , thanks to @entity74 , are not being dropped from their parents ' insurance coverage			2
he would allow insurance companies to keep charging women a billion dollars more every year than they charge men			0
he would eliminate mandatory preventative care coverage despite its life - saving benefits			0
in this , @entity33 has revealed an alarming lack of the vision required to lead			1
fundamentally , it 's that capacity for leadership that is most important in a president , which brings me back to the national conversation fueled by the verbal assault i experienced earlier this year			0
in the aftermath of those attacks , i was heartened by the many @entity41 of all political stripes who reached out to me and supported me			0
they knew that whether we agree or disagree , as @entity41 we defend one another 's right to speak before our elected officials without enduring personal attacks			1
@entity31 responded as so many @entity41 did , by condemning those attacks as antithetical to our democracy			1
@entity33 , when pressed to address those attacks , could only say , " those are n't the words i would have chosen			1
" if @entity33 lacks the leadership to stand up to extremists in his own party , then he 's not the president we need			1
at a time when women 's rights especially are under virulent attack , we can not elect a leader who wo n't or ca n't stand up to those extremists and protect the rights that generations of women have fought so hard to ensure			1
thankfully , we do n't have to			0
we have a president who has consistently shown he will defend those rights while working to ensure that all women and men have all the protections and opportunities they need to pursue economic success			2
but if we 're going to keep @entity31 in the @entity183 , we need to get involved , get out the vote and do what @entity33 refuses to do on everything from fair pay to women 's rights : speak up			1
i 'll never stop speaking up , and i hope you 'll join me			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity193 says stakes are high in the election , which is extremely personal for her
@entity193 : attacks on me brought home how easily women 's rights can be taken away
@entity33 is *anti-middle* class and *anti-women* , she says , and *panders* to extremists
@entity193 : we need to support @entity31 , who has the vision and values for a better @entity210
