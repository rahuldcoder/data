while the @entity7 governor 's unusual adoration of the @entity8 has been well documented , @entity2 's loyalty for @entity4 's team was on full display sunday night when he was seen giving @entity8 owner @entity10 a bear hug after the team made a huge comeback to defeat the @entity14			1
his embrace quickly spread via social media , drawing detractors and defenders alike for the governor 's @entity20 preference			0
as for the ribbing he got online , @entity2 said monday morning that nobody was giving him a hard time until the @entity8 started doing welâ € ‹ l. " i would take all the abuse that i 'm taking from some of these folks in return for @entity8 playoff wins , " @entity2 said on @entity30 's " @entity33 " radio show , where he does regular call - in interviews			1
the @entity39 described the celebratory mood in @entity10 ' box as " pandemonium " after the game			2
the locker room , he added , was also ecstatic , and he recalled being hugged by wide receiver @entity46			0
asked about the orange sweater he wore to the game , @entity2 said it was a good luck charm , one that he 's sported to every game he 's been to this year			2
" and they 've won all five , " he said			0
@entity2 defended his longtime , out - of - state loyalty , saying " you are who you are as a fan , " adding that he 's also remained a @entity61 fan in the @entity62 rather than a @entity64 fan			1
" he said he hopes to go to the @entity8 playoff game next weekend against the @entity67 at @entity68 in @entity69			0
asked if he 'll pay a visit to gov. @entity71 , a potential 2016 rival for the @entity39 presidential nomination , while he 's there , @entity2 said : " of course			1
@entity71 and @entity75 are friends , and i 'll see @entity71			0
" the @entity7 native has long been clear about his professional football allegiance , saying it dates back to when he was fascinated by quarterback @entity80 as a kid			2
@entity2 said in 2013 that his father was a @entity83 fan -- " every sunday , he 'd watch the @entity83 and yell at the tv set " -- and part of his own motivation for favoring the @entity8 stemmed from watching his dad get so upset on game days			2
" i used to think to myself , why do i want to root for a team that makes you angry ? so i decided not to			0
" more recently in a late december interview , @entity2 was grilled by @entity7 reporter @entity94 about appearances with @entity10 in the @entity8 owners ' box			1
" what is the deal ? " @entity94 demanded during his hour - long interview with @entity2 shortly before @entity100			0

you know ? so that 's who i am			0
" his brother , @entity110 , also came to his defense on sunday night , writing in a fiery @entity114 post : " to all of those non cowboy fans who have their panties in a ringer because the governor of @entity7 is a @entity8 fan --- get a life ! ! ! " while @entity2 acknowledges it 's politically incorrect to be a @entity8 fan in @entity7 , it could be a smart move in the @entity7 , which technically does n't have an @entity20 team			1
choosing one of the @entity130 teams might not win him many friends in the southern part of the state , close to the @entity134 -- and vice versa			0
regardless of his sports affiliations , @entity2 's friendship with @entity10 -- which he said developed over the past five years -- could be a valuable asset to the @entity7 governor if he runs for president in 2016			1
more importantly , @entity2 's friendship with @entity10 could help widen his donor network in a state where both @entity144 and former @entity146 gov. @entity145 -- two potential competitors -- have deep ties to many wealthy contributors across the state			1
@entity10 has been a generous contributor to @entity152 gov. @entity144 over the years , and also contributed to 2012 @entity154 nominee @entity154 's presidential campaign early in the cycle			2

former @entity163 gov. @entity162 said last month that @entity2 's unapologetic love for the @entity8 is " pathetic " and rooted in a " basic inferiority complex			1
" " if you are a @entity169 or a @entity170 and you 're rooting for the @entity8 , it means you 're not secure in yourself and you wanted to root for a team that was a team in your youth that was a constant winner , " the @entity134 fan said thursday on a radio show			1
he was booed by some of the children in the crowd at a central @entity7 elementary school during his 2013 gubernatorial campaign when he admitted the @entity8 were his favorite team			2
before revealing that choice , he warned the audience that his answer often " gets all my political advisers nervous			0
" @entity2 's favorite basketball team , the @entity183 , drew a more favorable response from the elementary school audience			2
when he named his favorite baseball team , the @entity186 , he got some heat from the young @entity189 fans in the crowd			0
