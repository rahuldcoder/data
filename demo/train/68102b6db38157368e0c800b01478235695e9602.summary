-- like so many others , i am distraught			1
it will take many days to sort through my feelings and reactions to the verdict of not guilty in the @entity8 case			1
still , some thoughts and lessons are obvious , immediate and , in a sense , imperative			1
first , those who delight in the verdict are wrong			1
there is no winner here			1
@entity8 is still dead and @entity16 still must live with the fact that he killed without reason or cause			2
here , the " should have " rules : he should have stayed in the truck			2
those who react to the verdict with despair are wrong			2
we work hard for justice in this world , but we , being human , are flawed			2
the law is only our best approximation of justice , and the law needs constant revision			2
but doing what 's right is not limited to the law			2
sometimes , we must go beyond it			2
opinion : @entity16 case echoes issues of race , guns those who expect -- perhaps desire -- a riot are wrong			0
we are better than that			0
while the law can not force a person to be moral or tolerant , through the law we can demand respect and expect equality			0
if we are to move forward as a country we must recognize that this case highlights three issues			0
we must confront these without excuse or rancor			0
we must be honest about our weaknesses			0
@entity57 : @entity8 could have been my son first , we are not in a post-racial society			1
racial profiling still exists and it is a cancer			0
assumptions and fallacies and prejudice feed it			0
we are suspicious of those who look different ; we are uncomfortable with cultural differences			0
we distrust what we do n't understand , but surely we should not act with violence or bigotry			1
if you do n't know about the " black male code , " you should			1
it 's something black boys learn early , even before adolescence			1
it goes , in part , like this : even though you 're not a criminal , some people assume you are , especially if you 're wearing certain clothes			0
never argue with the police , but protect your dignity and take pride in humility			0
as a black male , you must go above and beyond to show strangers what type of person you really are			1
there 's more , but you get the point : if you 're black and male , know that many @entity93 -- not all , not even most , but many -- assume you are guilty of something , just because you 're you			1
opinion : @entity8 could have been my son now try to live with that every day			0
we need to see ourselves through the eyes of others			0
finally , there 's the clich√© -- think before you act			0
thou shalt not murder is a universal commandment , one necessary for a civilized nation , a civilized world			0
let us focus on ways to improve the system -- the criminal system , the justice system , the moral system , the general welfare system			1
let us focus on acts of goodness and kindness that bring us together , as a people and as creations of @entity118			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .			1

@entity121 : there is no winner here
we are not in a post-racial society , @entity121 says
if you do n't know about " black male code , " you should , she says
now is a time to focus on improving the system , she says
