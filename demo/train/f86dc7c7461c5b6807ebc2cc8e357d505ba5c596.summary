-- football 's latest match - fixing scandal could have implications far wider than @entity4 , where 17 people were arrested on monday including former @entity7 player @entity6			1
@entity6 had already been banned until 2014 by the @entity8 in the first part of the " @entity11 " investigation earlier this year			1
the former @entity13 captain , whose club started this @entity16 season with a six - point penalty due to his and a teammate 's offenses , has now been suspected of trying to destroy evidence			2
prosecutors told reporters that the arrests , which also included former players @entity24 and @entity26 plus @entity28 's @entity27 and @entity30 's @entity29 , were " a starting point in cleaning up the beautiful game that is football			1
" @entity4 football journalist @entity33 told @entity0 that investigators had found links to people outside the country -- in @entity38 , @entity39 and other parts of @entity41			1
" this one can be bigger			0
this time investigators found a link between the single players in the team and someone abroad -- they talk about @entity46 , where we know there was already some suspicion of crime connected with illegal betting , " @entity33 said on monday			2
" this can also involve other leagues , not only @entity4			2
investigators said they will investigate @entity4 football because they are @entity4 investigators			1
" they know for sure there are games in @entity57 and @entity58 involved , and they suspect other @entity60 leagues including @entity62 leagues and @entity64 leagues			0
" @entity60 football 's governing body @entity65 has already had to deal with betting scandals in @entity41 and @entity68 this year			1
this is the latest in a series of investigations affecting @entity4			2
@entity72 lost two league titles in 2006 due to the " @entity84 " affair , which saw the @entity76 side relegated to @entity77 after being accused of rigging games by arranging " favorable " match officials and also implicated @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , and @entity83			0
@entity6 , 38 , was banned in august along with clubmate @entity85 and fellow former @entity4 international @entity86 , but all have denied any wrongdoing			1
@entity33 said it was likely that clubs are also involved , not just players -- one of who claimed such activities had been going on for a decade , according to prosecutors			1
" everything is connected with the fact that if single players are connected or clubs are connected , " @entity33 said			0
" last time , @entity84 , that was football institutions and the clubs			0
this time , as we saw already in summer , it 's so far just single players trying to make money giving connections and trying to fix the games through the contacts they have in football			0
" prosecutor @entity109 revealed the extent of outside involvement			0
" at the top of this organization are men from @entity46 , who are those who move the money , but the shareholders are divided from the @entity120 , to the @entity121 , to @entity39 , and they manage with their men how to change the outcome of football matches , " he told the @entity113 newspaper			1
meanwhile , former @entity13 coach @entity125 has been appointed as boss of @entity127 for the second time after @entity129 was sacked on monday			1
@entity129 took charge of the @entity16 side on a temporary basis at the end of august in his first major coaching role , and signed a two - year contract last month			0
but sunday 's 2 - 0 defeat by @entity138 rivals @entity137 left @entity127 10th in the table , and the 37 - year - old became the ninth coaching casualty in @entity16 this season			0
@entity125 , 57 , coached @entity127 in 2001 - 02 when the club languished in the second division			0
his last two jobs ended in relegation after taking over at @entity13 and @entity147 in the latter parts of the season .			2

@entity4 prosecutors find links to @entity38 , @entity39 and other parts of @entity41
