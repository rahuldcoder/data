@entity0 -- like so many other people of my generation , @entity2 and the @entity3 made an indelible stamp on my life			1
the very first piece of vinyl i actually owned -- and had n't borrowed from my older brother -- was the album " help ! " to this day , i can remember at the age of 8 dropping the needle on the disc and hearing @entity2 's voice roar through the 10 - inch speaker on my record player			1
the @entity3 had a profound influence on me			0
they 're the reason why i picked up a guitar , formed a band at age 11 and dreamed of a life as a rock star			0
fast - forward 16 years to december 8 , 1980			0
at the time , i was a music journalist for @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , hosting " @entity30 " program			1
just a couple of weeks earlier , we had reported on @entity2 's comeback with the album " @entity37 , " which marked his re-emergence after five years out of the music business as a self - proclaimed " househusband			1
" we were actively working with his record company , trying to set up an interview for a future edition of the program			0
i was not far from my 24th birthday when the telephone rang on that december day around 11:30 p.m. it was my executive producer , @entity43			0
" @entity2 has been shot , " he said , " and we need to do a special			2
" tell us where you were when @entity2 died it was one of those moments where time seems to slow down and the mind considers a hundred questions before finally settling on the truth : how could he have been shot ? are the reports mistaken ? who would do such a thing ? how could we lose such a pop culture icon ? did n't he just turn 40 ? did n't he have a young son ? did n't he have security ? will i wake up and this will all have been just a dream ? we gathered that night in our offices to sift through the material that we had : old @entity3 footage , a @entity2 documentary that my producer shot years earlier , and the famous @entity72 film			2
we collected the names of friends , collaborators and other acquaintances who could help us tell the @entity2 story			2
a day or two later , @entity26 aired a live broadcast of a memorial to @entity2 at @entity81 in front of @entity27 's @entity83			1
@entity28 had a rich history with @entity2 : it was there that he made his post-beatles debut with the @entity88 in 1969 and staged his famous @entity90 bed - in in @entity91			1
next wednesday marks 30 years since @entity2 's murder			1
his killer , @entity93 , 55 , is still serving his prison sentence of 20 years to life at the maximum - security @entity96 in @entity98			0
he will stay there for at least another two years as he was just denied parole for the sixth time			0
this weekend , @entity1 will examine the events leading up to @entity2 's killing			1
@entity93 and his wife , @entity104 , describe the murder in rare audio recordings that will debut on @entity1 's " @entity107 : countdown to murder			1
" @entity93 's childhood friends reveal an obsessive idolization of @entity2 that later turned to hatred			2
his wife talks about how she knew that her husband planned to kill @entity2 and explains why she did n't warn anyone			2
the impact of @entity2 's death still reverberates today			1
several tribute concerts and ceremonies started in october , when @entity2 would have turned 70 , and have carried on since			2
this year , @entity2 's widow , @entity119 , revived the @entity88 with current rock stars including @entity121			1
@entity119 told @entity122 she believes this rekindling of interest in @entity2 " has to do with the social climate , with wanting some of @entity2 's energy , power and conviction			1
" @entity2 's profound influence on music and musicians continues to this day			1
@entity132 , the lead singer of alt - rockers @entity132 , was not even 2 years old when @entity2 was killed			0
@entity135 penned the recent song " @entity137 " after stopping by @entity2 's old apartment building with his wife			1
he was so taken with the images that came to mind as he looked into the entranceway where @entity2 was shot that he walked across @entity142 , sat down on a park bench and penned these lyrics : outside the archway lies a thief , awaiting @entity37 he 's something evil underneath outside @entity137 died the symphony " i watched and i tried to imagine this going down , " @entity135 told me			2
" and then i tried to imagine what if it never happened , and that 's really the question of the song : ' if you just kept walking on your way			0
' i mean , would the world be different ? and i think the world would be better			0
" like @entity135 , i 've often wondered what would have happened had @entity2 not been murdered			0
would the world have been a better place ? there 's certainly every possibility that his commitment to peace would have added something substantive to the global conversation			0
at the very least , we would have had years more of great music and performance from a man who was truly an artistic genius			0
