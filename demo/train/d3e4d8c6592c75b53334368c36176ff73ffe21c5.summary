-- on monday , president @entity2 's two secretaries of state inadvertently collaborated with @entity5 's foreign minister to shape a twist in the @entity8 debate that a day later is looking more and more like a possible way out of the current crisis			1
it took an idea from being an off - the - cuff throwaway line through being an informal proposal to the point today where it will be proposed for consideration by the @entity18			0
perhaps more importantly for the president , it may help save him from a political showdown in @entity22 where it seems increasingly likely he can not win while adding a glimmer of hope to a story that for two weeks has been an unrelenting mess for the @entity26 and of deep concern to the @entity29 people			2
the first move came from the current secretary of state , @entity31			2
in a statement that was initially seen as a slip of the tongue ( probably because it was ) , @entity31 raised the possibility that if @entity8 were to give up its chemical weapons , an attack might be avoided			1
although the administration almost immediately backed away from the statement and the @entity42 foreign secretary characterized it as impossible , the idea quickly began to gain traction			0
@entity8 foreign minister @entity44 announced that his @entity5 counterpart @entity45 had proposed that @entity8 's chemical weapons be put under some form of international control as a way of forestalling a @entity29 - led attack			1
@entity44 went further , welcoming the initiative			0
it turned out @entity31 had spoken to @entity45			2
and while @entity55 's first response was natural skepticism given the misrepresentations of the @entity8 government in the past , it became clear that if there was any chance such an initiative could spare the president the political debacle of a failed vote in the @entity22 -- and possibly spare the country the costs of another military intervention in the region -- some in the administration felt it was worth considering			2
so , hours after a senior official had told @entity0 the @entity31 statement was a " major goof , " the press office in the @entity26 was claiming credit suggesting that the " credible threat " of a @entity29 plan had triggered the diplomatic opening			1
next up , former secretary of state @entity79 , who had already been teed up to offer a statement of support for her former boss / potential predecessor , made a brief statement that had to have been carefully cleared with the @entity26			0
she called the idea that @entity8 might give up its chemical weapons an " important step " if the @entity5 and the @entity8 actively followed up on it			1
this was yet another sign that the administration was hoping that the morning 's seeming misstep yield an opportunity to step away from a congressional showdown or at least buy some breathing room			0
further , while @entity94 did not address the specifics of @entity2 's proposed @entity8 intervention , she did say that she would support him			1
up until now , her silence on the issue was seen by some as an effort by the likely presidential candidate to distance herself from the @entity2 team 's muddled handling of the proposed @entity8 intervention			1
but monday 's message not only showed her political loyalty to the president but it also emphasized the outsized influence of her views in @entity29 and around the globe			1
in the wake of her remarks , there were initially reports that other nations , such as @entity115 , would welcome giving the @entity5 initiative a chance			0
the president framed it as a " potentially positive development			0
" then on tuesday , the @entity8 government formally accepted the @entity5 proposal			2
the @entity29 and @entity115 took the plan to the @entity18 to give it the formal backing and oversight of that institution			1
it is still clearly a long way from being realized but there is momentum			0
nonetheless , even should it blow up , appearing to consider it allows @entity2 to be able to say he had exhausted all diplomatic options to resolve the problem			2
and for the more the hawkishly inclined , it would also be seen as reminder that military pressure is often key to producing peaceful , political outcomes			0
either way , for a moment , an idea that might ultimately seem to be in the interest of @entity2 , @entity5 president @entity141 , @entity8 president @entity142 and , arguably , the @entity143 ( to the extent they no longer might face chemical weapons ) gained surprising traction			1
this was thanks in part to the seeming misstep of @entity29 's current top diplomat , to his swift interaction with his @entity5 counterpart , and the added weight his predecessor 's views brought to the matter			0
it is a long - shot proposal started perhaps by accident , promoted by parties who have regularly lied , and cautiously embraced by a @entity29 administration whose policies in @entity8 have been incoherent by any measure			1
regardless of whether it amounts to anything or not , it speaks volumes about how bad our options are			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

@entity174 : @entity31 , @entity94 collaborated ( accidentally ? ) to add hopeful twist on @entity8
in a " goof , " @entity31 said @entity8 yielding chemical weapons might avert @entity29 strike , @entity174 says
potential presidential candidate @entity94 called it " important step " and showed her influence
@entity174 : even if plan fails , it gives @entity2 cover for trying diplomacy
