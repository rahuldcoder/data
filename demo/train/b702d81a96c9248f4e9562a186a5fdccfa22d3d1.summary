-- @entity3 's @entity2 compound is the heart of his nearly 42 - year rule , a symbol of his defiance of the @entity8			1
the sprawling complex houses modern government offices , the @entity12 tent in which @entity3 received visitors and stands of palm trees			1
a bombed - out building remains as a monument to a 1986 @entity19 airstrike that killed one of @entity3 's daughters , along with a statue of a @entity24 fist crushing an @entity19 jet			1
and tuesday evening , after rebel fighters who have battled @entity3 's forces for six months punched into the compound , it was wreathed in smoke			1
rebels posed around the statue and fired hundreds if not thousands of rounds of ammunition into the air in celebration , spurring the occasional rebuke from senior fighters			0
the rebels picked through the compound in search of @entity24 's longtime strongman , but one fighter told @entity0 that neither @entity3 nor any members of his family had been found			1
@entity2 appeared to have been abandoned so quickly that a teakettle remained heating on a stove in one building , he said			1
" they ran away , all of them , " he said			0
" they have gone underground			0
" @entity2 , located near @entity55 's @entity54 shore , is believed to be undergirded by a network of tunnels			2
@entity58 , a former @entity3 aide , told @entity0 that at least one of the older buildings on the site was built atop a bunker four stories underground			2
but he said it was unlikely that @entity3 had been in the complex before it was overrun tuesday , since it had been targeted by repeated @entity69 airstrikes during the last few months of fighting			1
" you have to remember that he is a military man , " @entity58 said			0
" he knows they have weapons that could penetrate those bunkers			0
" in addition , he said , the poor quality of the audio messages @entity3 delivered on state television sunday suggests @entity3 " is speaking from a distance			2
" @entity0 national security contributor @entity81 had what she called an " absolutely bizarre experience " meeting there with the eccentric @entity24 leader in the summer of 2007 , when she served as president @entity88 's chief counterterrorism advisor			0
@entity89 said she was required to ride to the compound in a car sent by @entity3 , and the @entity24 tried to separate her from her @entity19 security detail , but one agent was able to jump into the car before it departed			1
once through a series of checkpoints , @entity89 said , the driver stopped in front of the bombed - out museum -- an echo of a @entity19 raid in retaliation for the bombing of a @entity106 disco that killed two @entity19 servicemen			2
she then waited in one of the many spacious rooms decorated in traditional @entity111 fashion , with couches lining the perimeter , for her audience with @entity3			0
the @entity24 ruler 's tent was surrounded by a field of knee - high grass , as well as both uniformed and plainclothes guards			0
inside , it was filled with numerous rugs and couches			0
other visitors say the compound includes a mosque , a library and the residences of other government officials			1
@entity0 's @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 compound includes @entity3 's home and government offices
also inside are a building hit in a 1986 @entity19 airstrike and @entity3 's @entity12 tent
rebel fighters overran the site on tuesday after six months of fighting
