helium - voiced hit " lights , " then , an elegant read of @entity5 's " @entity4 " that led to a gig at prince @entity8 's wedding			2
as @entity12 stories go , it 's a good one			0
but as a 25 - year - old adept who dresses rave - y hooks in folk - rock tunefulness and art - pop filigree , @entity1 earned her glass slippers			1
" @entity20 , " her second lp , pumps up her sound as befitting a court musician			1
the single " anything could happen " has the @entity23 swooping around staccato piano and club beats ; elsewhere she 's multitracked into a one - woman choir			2
if the songwriting does n't quite measure up to @entity30 art - pop divas like @entity31 , the hooks always go to town , and her voice -- @entity34 - dazzling in the upper register -- mates gorgeously with electronics , swirling around itself on the title track , morphing through synthscapes on " @entity40			0
" " @entity41 , " a bangin ' collab with @entity44 rave - op master @entity43 ( @entity45 's " @entity48 " ) , gets slotted as a " bonus cut , " maybe to avoid confusing the more genteel fans			1
but @entity1 's magic is in her multitasking			1
and if she really gets busy with current paramour @entity52 , things could get even more interesting			0
