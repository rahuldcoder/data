-- when @entity2 graduated from his @entity4 - based university in 2005 , he was filled with high hopes of entrepreneurial success			1
but after his business endeavors failed to take off for years , @entity2 had no option but to move back to his mother 's house in @entity11			1
returning home as a penniless 29 - year - old was " a harrowing experience " but provided @entity2 , a chemist by training , with his @entity17 moment -- he realized there 's a growing appetite for @entity21 films after noticing how his mother and other relatives had difficulties getting their hands on their beloved movies from @entity28 's booming film industry			1
the tech entrepreneur spotted the gap in the market and in 2010 he founded @entity32 , an internet company that distributes @entity21 films to viewers across the world			1
described as the " @entity37 , " @entity36 's company has today grown to have more than 500,000 registered users			1
it has offices in @entity11 , @entity41 and @entity42 with some 100 staff and has secured $ 8 million in funding from @entity46 - based hedge fund @entity45 , early investors in @entity48			0
earlier this week it launched a new internet subscription service which enables viewers to watch exclusive @entity21 films for $ 5 a month			1
@entity0 's @entity53 spoke to @entity2 about entrepreneurship in @entity55 , @entity21 and his plans for the future			1
@entity0 : why did you decide to launch the subscription service ? @entity2 : when we started the company , @entity32 , we were trying to solve the massive , i would say , dislocation in the popularity of @entity21 and the value it 's created			1
a big part of what we did was actually focusing on cleaning up and organizing the content so we can provide a superior user experience , something which @entity21 lovers can really be proud of			2

people really love this content , which means it should be organized and given to them in the best format possible			0
we 've spent a lot of money -- in the industry , licenses , organizing our team , we 've got a staff of 100 people -- so our view is that some additional value needs to ... be given to this new subscription service we 're rolling out , ( called ) @entity93 +			1
@entity0 : your company has been described as the @entity37			1
do you want to be as big as @entity37 ? @entity96 : at the moment we are focusing on the 30 million @entity55 diaspora			2
we 've just reached 500,000 registered users , we think our additional market in the @entity100 is at least five to 10 million people , there are lots of @entity55 who love this stuff			1
i guess , ultimately , the big market is @entity28 ... this is where the content originates from			2
if you spend any time in @entity28 , it is difficult to come across a person who has n't heard of @entity21			1
but at the same time , the pan-african nature of it -- from the @entity116 to the @entity117 to @entity118 to people in the @entity120 -- there 's a massive base of people who really love this content			0
so because of the broadband restrictions in @entity55 , we are currently focused on the diaspora			0
@entity0 : do you see the potential in the future to become as big as @entity37 ? @entity96 : i think @entity37 has 25 million subscribers across @entity130 , @entity46 @entity131 and the @entity4			2
we are really young , as ambitious as we want to be			0
are there 25 million people who love this content ? most definitely there are 25 million people in @entity28 who love this content			2
are they willing to pay for it ? that 's the big experiment we 're kind of playing now			0
so we would n't want to compare ourselves to @entity37 but we have an interest and opportunity to at least get somewhere along that line			2
@entity0 : where are most of your viewers based ? @entity96 : currently our biggest markets are the @entity46 , the @entity4 , @entity131 , @entity146 and @entity147			0

@entity0 : web connectivity and internet penetration are major issues in @entity55			0
have there been any improvements recently ? @entity96 : eighteen months ago when i moved to @entity28 , broadband was really expensive and not that great			2
now it 's less expensive and it 's much better			0
internet adoption has definitely exploded in @entity28 and we feel it 's better -- again , we 're trying to serve very data - intensive , bandwidth hogging files , so we 're always going to be slower on the uptake but it is improving			1

i graduated in 2005 and then i started an entrepreneurial sort of trail			0
whereas my friends went into banking , consulting , finance , i just wanted to be an entrepreneur , to work in projects which really interested me			0
unfortunately , for five , almost six years i failed miserably at being an entrepreneur			0
so , in fact , literally what prompted the whole genesis of @entity32 was at 29 , almost 30 i had to move back with my mum			2
that was itself a harrowing experience but the interesting thing was that for the first time in eight years since i 'd moved out i was actually able to see the viewing patterns of my mom change ... she 'd gone from watching western films to watching @entity55 films			0
watch : @entity55 's internet awakening because i was able to observe her and we lived together then i could actually relate and she 'd spend hours watching it			2
then i had to drive her around to go and see my aunts and uncles who i had n't seen in a long time -- it was exactly the same thing for these guys and i was like ' well , how can it be that so quickly so many people 's viewing , video and entertainment habits change			0
' so it was really intriguing to find this stuff			0
watch : @entity226 : @entity21 's @entity227 @entity0 : what has been the reaction from the @entity28 film industry ? @entity96 : the key thing is that we 've invested more money in @entity21 in the shortest space of time -- far more than anybody else has done			1
we are remunerating movie producers who , quite rightly , are receiving additional revenue form their films as we have opened up a new funding avenue for them			0
before , they were losing out to the pirates , now they are gaining financially from @entity93			0
hopefully this new approach to monetizing @entity21 content will lead to producers re-investing in their films .			1
