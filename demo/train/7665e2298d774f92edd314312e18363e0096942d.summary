-- @entity1 thought her prayers had been answered			2
@entity1 , left , was desperate to find affordable health care for her daughter @entity4			1
her daughter , @entity4 , desperately needed to see a doctor after suffering a brain injury in a car accident , but health insurance companies would n't sell her a policy because of her pre-existing condition			1
so @entity11 was relieved to find @entity12 while surfing the @entity13			0
it was n't insurance but a program that advertised deep discounts at doctors ' offices and hospitals			1
@entity11 immediately signed up for the program , which she says advertised $ 30 doctor visits and $ 50 visits to specialists			0
" it was pretty phenomenal , " @entity11 said			0
" they promised me everything was included , " including doctor visits , vision , dental and hospital stays			0
" they even mentioned the @entity34			0
" @entity11 paid $ 314 for the card up front and then $ 179 each month after that			1
her daughter made an appointment to see dr. @entity40 , a @entity41 , @entity42 , gastroenterologist , to get treatment for her @entity45 's disease			0
@entity40 was listed on @entity47 's web site as being part of its network , but when @entity4 arrived at @entity40 's office , his staff said they did n't accept the @entity47 card			1
in fact , they said they 'd never even heard of @entity47 , @entity1 says			0
according to @entity11 , this same scene played out with several other doctors and hospitals			1
" i have never been more angry , more furious about anything in my life , " @entity11 said			0
" it is a bogus scam that hurts people			1
it should be a crime for people to do that			1
" the @entity69 and at least eight states have taken action against more than two dozen health cards for offering discounts services that do n't exist			1
" medical discount cards are spreading like kudzu , " said @entity74 , a spokesman for the @entity75			1
" there 's a tremendous amount of fraud and deception in these plans because they 're not well regulated			0
" " medical discount cards are awful , " said @entity84 , senior program editor with @entity85			1
" they 're absolute ripoffs			0
i would stay away from them completely			0
" two to 4 million people have purchased health care discount cards like the one @entity11 bought , according to the @entity93 , a trade group representing companies that sell the cards			1
the group acknowledges that there are some dishonest companies out there but says they do not reflect the majority of the industry			1
on its web site , @entity93 has set up a consumer guide for shopping for a discount health care program			1
the cards are attractive to people like @entity11 who do n't have health insurance from their jobs and ca n't buy it on their own			1
" members stay in these programs because they see the savings , " said @entity109 , a lawyer for the @entity93			0
" @entity114 health care programs are n't the answer to this country 's health care crisis , but for people without any access to insurance , saving money with these programs is better than nothing			1
" @entity1 canceled her daughter 's card in march , three months after signing up			1
@entity4 , who recently received a master 's degree in rehabilitative counseling , is now looking for a job with health benefits			2
repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment from @entity47 have gone unanswered			0
@entity40 is still listed on @entity47 's web site as an in - network doctor , but when @entity0 called his office , his staff said they did n't accept the card			1
the @entity139 says that although some discount cards are fraudulent , others are legitimate			1
here are some tips to know a good company from a bad one			0
consumer advocates say you should suspect a scam if : 1			2
you learn of the discount card from a blast fax or @entity13 popup ad			1
the @entity139 considers this a red flag that you 're about to be scammed			0
you can read the rest of the warnings on its web site			0
they promise a certain percentage savings			2
" a 30 percent discount means nothing			2
thirty percent off of what ? " @entity84 asked			0
they use the term " guaranteed coverage			0
" this makes the card sound like insurance , which it 's not , says the @entity75			2
the coalition also lists other scam alerts on its web site			2
they wo n't give you a list of providers until you sign up			2
the discount card company should tell you the providers up front			1
if they wo n't , hang up the phone			2
if they do , call the providers and verify that they take the card			2
it sounds too good to be true			0
" if you 've looked into getting regular insurance and gotten a price , and then you find something way cheaper , that 's a huge red flag , " @entity84 said			0
" it 's cheaper for a reason			0
