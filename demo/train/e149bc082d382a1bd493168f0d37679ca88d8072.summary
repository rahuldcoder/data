@entity2 , @entity3 @entity1 gov. @entity0 dominates almost any room he enters but is suddenly facing questions about his relevance in the 2016 presidential race			1
the surprisingly fast - moving @entity10 presidential contest , kicked off by @entity11 shortly after the @entity12 and accelerated by the unexpected re-emergence of @entity14 , is putting pressure on @entity0 , who was once the @entity10 establishment 's favorite			1
the big - check @entity10 contributors that were once assumed to be @entity0 's for the taking — in particular the @entity19 financiers just across the @entity20 from @entity1 — are now being courted aggressively by @entity11 and @entity14 as they ramp up their campaigns			1
" there is big advantage to moving first , and when you 're a whale like both @entity11 and @entity14 are , and you jump into that pool first , its hard for anyone else to squeeze in , " said @entity24 , a @entity25 billionaire and @entity10 donor who has not committed to supporting a candidate			1
" they have the same donor base , so they have to go after those guys			0
" @entity11 has been a well - liked figure in the center - right donor set for years , thanks to his widespread family connections and the perks and ambassadorships doled out by two previous @entity43			2
the former @entity45 governor has also been a champion of immigration reform , a precious issue for the business community and republicans who want to grow the party 's appeal among @entity52 , even as conservatives bristle at the idea			0
@entity14 , meanwhile , built an impressive financial network during his 2012 campaign , and many of those donors are waiting to see what he does before committing to another candidate			2
his surprising decision last week at a @entity63 donor meeting to " show some 2016 leg , " as one attendee put it , was designed to keep @entity11 at bay as he mulls a third presidential bid			1
but their moves are also complicating things for @entity0 , who is still expected to launch a presidential bid but is moving at a much slower place than @entity11 or @entity14			1
all three republicans will be competing for a similar slice of establishment - friendly financial backers and voters should they each seek the @entity10 nomination			1
@entity0 , already hamstrung on fundraising by strict pay - to - play laws that prohibit @entity19 employees from from contributing to governors seeking federal office , was further diminished in the eyes of some donors last year by the " @entity87 " scandal and its subsequent investigations			2
@entity0 's record as governor has also been met with some skepticism by the business community : @entity1 has seen eight credit downgrades and continues to have some of the highest taxes in the country			1
his fading star opened the door last year for @entity11 to start making calls to potential supporters who might have previously been with with @entity0			1
@entity0 's team insists the @entity14 and @entity11 developments have had little bearing on his decision - making process — or his ability to fund a potential campaign			1
" the last couple of weeks actually had no impact , " said one @entity0 confidante , granted anonymity to discuss the 2016 machinations with some candor			1
" he is not changing his plans			0
he is not moving up any schedule			0
he is attending a bunch of inaugurals			0
he has a bunch of speeches coming up			0
he feels he is in good position and he feels like he has time to decide to want to do more			0
" the adviser pointed out that @entity0 is fresh off an impressive tenure as chairman of the @entity122 , a post that put him in regular touch with some of the party 's biggest contributors			1
he remains on the @entity122 's executive committee , and plans to connect with many of the same donors at february gathering of the @entity122 in @entity131			0
no candidate — even ones with the names @entity11 and @entity14 — can take the donor world for granted , the @entity0 adviser insisted			1
" i think all three of them , @entity14 , @entity11 , gov. @entity0 , have a leg up on donor world , " the source said			1
" but you take those people for granted at your own peril			0
everybody will be courting those folks , but i think the smart folks will take their time			0
" to most @entity148 , the donor courtship now underway is hidden from view and largely meaningless			0
but in the early stages of a presidential primary , the whims of big donors have outsized importance , especially in a @entity156 world where a single rich person can prop up a candidate with a well - funded super pac			0
as the costs of running a presidential campaign skyrocket , landing the support of a major bundler can bring instant credibility to a candidate even before the campaign begins in earnest			0
early signals indicate that @entity0 might not be hard up for cash should he decide to run			2
already he has secured the backing of @entity174 bundler @entity173 , a recently - departed @entity175 finance chairman , two @entity10 sources confirmed to @entity4			2
and the @entity177 reported this week that @entity178 , the @entity179 founder and prominent @entity10 donor , is organizing a dinner for @entity0 and potential supporters in @entity63 later this month			1
once the donor primary ends and the actual primary begins , @entity0 may be on better footing in a race against @entity11 and @entity14			1
" there is room in the primary for anyone who has enough resources , " said @entity187 , a longtime @entity3 power broker and @entity14 ally			2
" look , it 's a little different talking about how you connect with voters , and it 's another story talking about how you connect with the large scale fundraisers			0
but the fact is , @entity3 will give every candidate a fair shot			0
there is not home court advantage here for anyone at all			0
" though both of @entity0 's potential rivals in the establishment lane have big networks and deep experience in national politics , both of them are older than than the 52 - year old @entity0			1
@entity14 is 67 and @entity11 is 61 , and both could be tagged as stale emblems of the past			1
@entity0 , too , is a natural retail campaigner and perhaps the best political performer of anyone in the @entity10 field			1
the contrast could be stark against the buttoned - up , bespectacled @entity11 and the notoriously awkward @entity14			1
" he is kind of a hell - raiser , and nobody is going to say that about @entity11 or @entity14 , " said @entity226 , a @entity227 attorney who hosted a reception for @entity0 in the early primary state this week			1
" he is not like a lot of the other folks that are running that are more cautious and calculating			0
folks are getting tired of that			0
they like his authenticity , which he has got all day long			0
that 's sort of a counter to @entity14			2
with @entity14 , you 're never sure if you 're getting the real @entity14 or the @entity14 he thinks you want			2
" though he 's been slower than @entity11 or @entity14 when it comes to hiring staff and building out a campaign , @entity0 is still looking and sounding very much like a candidate - in - waiting			1
he is likely to launch a political action committee in the coming weeks , multiple @entity10 sources said , and he is heading to a big conservative gathering in @entity248 after this week 's excursion to @entity227			1
@entity0 can afford to wait longer than other candidates , his supporters said , in part because of his fame			2
he does n't need to introduce himself to voters in the way @entity11 will , for instance			2
" so much of politics these days is celebrity , " @entity226 said			0
" we have got to find somebody who has the substance and the integrity , but is also a celebrity			0
and @entity0 has got that			2
" in @entity227 , where he attended the inauguration of gov. @entity266 , @entity0 posed for selfies with top elected officials , including the lieutenant governor and attorney general , before dropping by a crowded @entity10 meet - and - greet arranged by @entity226 and other @entity10			1
the reception was a positive one			0
@entity0 's speech to the audience was " short on conservative red meat , but long on how he 's the guy that can win , " said one @entity10 who attended the afternoon session , held at a @entity280 law firm			1
" he said something to the effect of , ' today is @entity266 's day , but maybe it will be @entity0 's day in @entity227 soon , " the source told @entity4			2
" you could n't walk away from that thinking anything other than he 's going to run			0
" after the event , @entity288 , the chairman of the @entity289 , posted photos of the event on @entity293			0
" my honor to introduce @entity0 in @entity227 today , " he wrote			0
" the man tells it like it is ... we like that in @entity227 ! "			0

@entity0 was once the @entity10 establishment 's favorite heading into 2016
but he could face *challenges* if @entity14 and @entity11 enter the race
