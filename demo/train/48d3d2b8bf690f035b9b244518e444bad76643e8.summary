during the @entity3 halftime show , @entity1 internet users were abuzz about a woman called " @entity6			1
" sounds mysterious , but you already know who she is			0
" @entity6 , " or " shui guo jie , " is what people in @entity1 call @entity12 -- referring to her tendency to wear fruit costumes and bring giant fruit with her on stage			1
in the past , the pop star has performed in sparkly watermelon - cup bras , sung while holding a large inflatable strawberry and even burst out of a giant banana			0
she 's also talked about growing and eating her own fruit , so it 's a pretty fair nickname			0
but " @entity6 " is n't the only @entity24 celeb to get an interesting @entity1 alias			1
here are a few others and the stories behind them : a popular nickname for @entity29 in @entity30 and @entity1 is " luo ba , " which translates to " @entity32			1
" it 's actually a bit of a pun			0
" @entity38 " sounds similar to how @entity1 people transliterate @entity29 's last name , " @entity37			1
" either way , it 's a fitting moniker for the superstar who revealed her bare behind in the music video for her song " @entity45			0
" @entity46 is known as " @entity47 , " or " juan fu			1
" in @entity49 , " juan " means curly , referring to @entity46 's curly hairstyle in his role as @entity53			1
" @entity58 " means happiness , fortune , or blessing -- and it 's the first part of the @entity1 name for @entity53			1
put those two together , and you get something like " @entity61 " or , more poetically , " @entity47			1
" many @entity1 dishes are n't just spicy			1
thanks to a special peppercorn , @entity64 cuisine carries an extra kick and will actually numb your tongue			0
that 's why @entity1 fans have nicknamed @entity72 " @entity73 , " or " @entity74 " : she 's spicy hot ; she 'll stun your senses and leave you wanting more			1
@entity76 are n't the only ones who swoon over @entity79 ; @entity1 people call him " @entity82 , " or " sao dang			1
" " his voice is very ' unique ' and kind of arousing , and his fans always refer to his numerous half naked photo shoots , which gives him the name , " explains @entity4 's @entity84 intern @entity83			0
but sao , the @entity1 word for " flirty , " can also mean frivolous , silly or shallow			1
@entity92 's popular @entity1 nickname is " @entity93 , " or " niu jie			1
" here 's why : there 's a crude but popular @entity1 slang phrase , " cow 's vagina " or " niubi , " that means " f * * * ing awesome			2
" so " @entity105 sister , " despite the sound of it , is really a compliment , a nod to @entity92 's incredible singing talent			0
another explanation is that it refers to a 1992 episode of " @entity110 " that featured a singing cow named @entity112			0
@entity1 people call @entity113 " little cow " or " xiao niu " because her voice reminds them of @entity92 's ( @entity93 )			2
as one @entity1 internet user says , watch @entity118 's cover of @entity92 's " emotions , " and you 'll be tempted to agree			2
to get why @entity122 is nicknamed " @entity123 , " or " biao jie , " you 'll have to get @entity1 humor			2
in the run - up to the @entity127 , hundreds of @entity1 internet users made joke announcements about the results , all claiming they heard them from a " cousin in the @entity132			2
" it was a playful dig at how some @entity1 people are desperate to show they have powerful family members			2
but one @entity1 internet user upped the ante , boldly declaring that @entity138 was his cousin and that she had won the @entity141			2
well , she did n't , but the nickname stuck			0
yep , @entity144 is simply known as " boss , " or " lao ban			0
" it 's an awed reference to the entertainer 's investments : from clothing companies to tech startups to golf courses to record labels , the @entity145 owns it all			0
@entity155 is called " @entity156 " in @entity157			2
the joke took off in 2011 after a @entity157 news anchor struggled with @entity155 's name , calling him " @entity156 " on tv			0
even today , tongue - in - cheek @entity157 media and their counterparts in @entity30 still refer to the actor 's @entity166 - inspired nickname			0
@entity4 interns @entity169 , @entity83 , @entity4 's @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
