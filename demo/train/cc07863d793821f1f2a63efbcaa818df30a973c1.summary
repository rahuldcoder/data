-- the @entity2 administration finally got it right when it decided to stop fighting to put age limits on who can buy morning - after pill @entity6 without a prescription			1
the fight started a year and a half ago , when apparently for the first time in history , the secretary of health and human services overruled a @entity14 decision			2
the @entity14 said @entity6 should be sold the way aspirin is sold -- with no restrictions			1
the @entity2 administration wanted age limits ; a coalition of reproductive rights groups sued the government , and on monday , the @entity22 backed down and ended the legal wrangling			1
plan b one - step is a form of emergency contraception			1
it works like other forms of birth control pills , by preventing an egg from being released from the ovaries			0
feds drop ' morning - after pill ' appeal it has secondary effects as well			1
it may work to prevent fertilization of an egg if one has already been released			0
it may also stop an egg that has been fertilized from implanting in the wall of the uterus			0
but it does not cause an already implanted , fertilized egg to be aborted			0
in other words , it only works to prevent pregnancy , not to end one			1
the difference between this drug and conventional birth control pills is that it can be taken right after sex instead of daily			0
long before hhs secretary @entity55 overruled the @entity14 , adults could buy it without a prescription			0
if you were 17 and could show identification proving your age , you could also buy the drug without a prescription			1
if you were 16 and younger , you needed one			0
this is not the way drugs are normally treated			0
usually , there are prescription drugs and over-the - counter drugs			2
few fall into this prove - your - age category			1
pseudoephedrine does , for instance , because people are concerned you might take it and make crystal meth			0
but the vast , vast majority of medications do not			0
to enact this kind of pre-authorization , you 'd need a compelling reason			0
some argued that allowing the drug to be sold so freely to kids would be implicit consent for them to have sex			0
i hate to break it to you , but they 're having sex already			0
do n't take my word for it as a pediatrician -- lots of research shows that kids are having sex before they are 16			2
whether or not @entity6 is sold in pharmacies without a prescription is n't going to change that			1
moreover , this is the same argument people have made about the hpv vaccine , that it would make girls more promiscuous , and research shows that is n't true			1
others , including the @entity2 administration , argued that it was too dangerous for girls to be allowed access to this drug because they could n't understand its proper use , and they might abuse it			1
this might be a compelling argument , if it , too , had n't already been studied			2
as the @entity14 conducted the review that informed its decision , the @entity114 specifically evaluated whether @entity6 was safe and effective in younger girls , whether they understood its proper use , and whether they appreciated that it would n't protect them from sexually transmitted infections			1
the center found that girls did understand all of these points , and that 's why it ruled that it could be sold to them without a prescription			2
this argument seems to be applied only to @entity6 , and not any other drugs			1
for instance , in 2011 , more than 117,000 calls were made to poison control centers for kids under the age of 5 because of exposure to pain medications			2
more than 44,000 calls were made for small children exposed to antihistamines			0
even more calls were made for adults			0
these drugs cause thousands of problems a year , and sometimes even deaths			0
yet no one thinks about making those medications harder to get			0
president @entity2 said that the reason a 10 - or 11 - year - old should not be able to buy @entity6 " alongside bubble gum or batteries " was because if they did n't use it properly , it " could have an adverse effect			1
" from 2008 till 2011 , 10 children died in the @entity150 from ingesting batteries			0
@entity6 killed no one at all			1
although @entity6 is legally available to girls age 17 with proof - of - age right now , misinformation , and sometimes pharmacists ' views , can prevent girls from obtaining the drug in time			1
if you do n't take the medication soon after sex , it becomes less effective			2
delays -- such as needing to get a prescription , or being denied it by a pharmacist -- could make it useless			0
when @entity2 took office , he promised to shield science from politics			1
yet in ignoring the findings of the @entity14 , he did the opposite			0
science shows @entity6 is safe and effective , and meets the standards for over-the - counter use			1
science shows that other drugs are far more dangerous , yet they receive none of the consideration @entity6 does			1
this drug is controversial because it involves sex and pregnancy			2
in deciding not to pursue the case , the @entity22 has chosen to side with science			2
those reasons , unfortunately , appear to be more pragmatic than scientific			0
it seems that even now , a senior administration official told the @entity192 , @entity2 still opposes over-the - counter access to emergency contraception for young girls			1
some believe that this move is a political decision -- that he really is n't opposed but gets to appear like he is while still getting the decision he wants			2
if that 's the case , it 's a bit too cynical for me			0
i 'd rather see an administration that is consistent in its reliance on science , data and evidence			1
in this case , the administration got it right , even if it 's for the wrong reason			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

administration stopped fighting to put age limits on buying morning - after pill @entity6
@entity213 : @entity6 prevents pregnancy but does not end it , and is safe and easy to use
arguments debunked , he says : girls use it correctly , and it does n't cause promiscuity
@entity213 : by dropping its campaign , administration sides with science , not politics
