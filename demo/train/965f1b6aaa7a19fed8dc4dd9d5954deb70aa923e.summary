-- like former @entity4 press secretary @entity3 , my life has a " before " and an " after			1
" for @entity3 , who died monday at 73 , the " before " was the time leading up to march 30 , 1981 , when he was gravely wounded by an assassin aiming for president @entity8 , who was also seriously wounded			1
for me , " before " was my life as a nurse , wife , and mother leading up to december 7 , 1993 , when a mentally disturbed gunman shot and killed my husband , @entity13 , and severely wounded my son @entity14 during a mass shooting on the @entity16			1
the " after " for @entity3 and for me has been a life colored by sadness and loss , but also driven by a cause bigger than both of us : ending violence caused by guns in this country			1
@entity3 did not choose to be a leading advocate to prevent gun violence , but he embraced that role with courage and grace			2
@entity3 and his wonderfully steely wife , @entity31 , founded the @entity32 and went to work to ensure that other individuals and families would not have to endure what they suffered after the 1981 shooting			2
@entity3 and @entity31 have been leaders in the anti-gun violence effort for over 30 years and they have always handled their roles in a way that has earned them admirers across this country and around the world			1
@entity3 and @entity31 have led the discussion on the role guns play in our society			0
i first met @entity3 in late 1993 after the @entity16 shooting			0
he and @entity31 were very kind and provided me with hope for life after my shooting tragedy			1
even while recovering from his severe head wound , he moved forward into his own new life of prodding @entity55 into addressing gun violence in a commonsense manner			1
@entity3 had a great sense of humor and he used that humor to put people at ease when they met him			0
he never played the martyr			0
@entity3 and i were once discussing my son 's recovery from his gunshot wounds and i told @entity3 that @entity14 wanted to go skydiving			2
i had my doubts , but @entity3 thought it was a great goal			0
he said , on behalf of all shooting victims , " we want to show people that we are still the person we were and we do things that people think we ca n't			0
" on his next birthday , @entity14 went skydiving			0
@entity3 's lasting legacy is , of course , the law that bears his name			2
the @entity81 , providing for background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases , has been in effect for more than 20 years			0
it has blocked more than 2 million gun sales to felons , fugitives and those suffering from mental illness			0
while the tragedies of @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , and unfortunately many others demonstrate that we have more to do toward ending gun violence in @entity55 , @entity3 leaves us with a law that has undoubtedly saved many lives			1
the @entity3 law continues to protect @entity55 , and the life of @entity3 will continue to inspire all those faced with challenge and tragedy			1
my friend , @entity3 , will be greatly missed .			0

@entity109 : like @entity3 , her life had " before " and " after " a shooting tragedy
she lost her husband , and son injured ; @entity3 was gravely wounded by would - be assassin
she says @entity3 and @entity120 's anti-gun violence efforts have made huge mark in @entity55
@entity109 : @entity3 funny , brave , *supportive* . his legacy is @entity81 , which has saved lives
