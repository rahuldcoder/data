-- a huge winter storm was affecting the @entity3 on sunday , poised to dump up to 10 feet of snow in some higher elevations , and causing flooding and potential mudslides in lower spots while impacting driving conditions and air travel , forecasters said			1
a winter storm warning remained in effect through monday afternoon for @entity15 's @entity14 mountains , from @entity16 to @entity17 , according to the @entity18			1
" storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely , " the weather service said , and periods of heavy snow will continue through monday			1
high winds are also forecast for the region			1
" travel into the high country of the southern @entity14 may be difficult , if not impossible , " according to forecasters			2
that possibility exists for the northern sierras as well			1
at 3:56 p.m. @entity30 , the @entity18 was predicting blizzard conditions with winds of up to 70 mph along the higher mountain passes			1
that could shut down traffic along @entity36 , state highway 50 and state highway 88			2
the @entity18 was urging residents in the higher mountain areas to check their generators and buy extra food and supplies			2
" it 's going to be an all - day onslaught , " said @entity0 meteorologist @entity43			2
areas from @entity47 westward will see rain , he said			1
at lower elevations , heavy rain was causing flash flooding in a number of locations			1
flood advisories and watches were posted almost the entire length of @entity15 , from @entity57 to @entity58			1
@entity60 had received 2 to 3 inches of rain as of about 2:30 a.m. sunday ( 5:30 a.m. et ) , and " more significant rain " was on the way , forecasters said			1
flooding in the @entity64 , which includes @entity65 and @entity66 , is a " firm possibility , " said @entity43			2
footage from @entity66 showed drivers creeping through water on roadways			2
as of sunday afternoon , the @entity72 was reporting localized flooding across the state , prompting road closings in @entity76 , @entity65 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
and with the heavy rain comes the threat of mudslides , especially in areas near @entity60 affected by this year 's wildfires , where there is no vegetation to hold the soil in place , @entity43 said			1
the soil becomes saturated and gravity pulls it downward			2
" some minor debris and rock slides have already been reported early this morning , " said a southern @entity15 flood advisory issued by the @entity18 , " and this threat will likely continue through this morning			1
" the threat could also be delayed , meaning it will not abate when the rains stop and could occur later , @entity43 said			0
in @entity100 a minor mudslide forced the closing of one of two lanes on @entity36 on sunday			1
the storm -- actually a series of storms -- were triggered by " deep persistent moisture " originating from the subtropical @entity108 and surging northeastward , said @entity0 meteorologist @entity109			0
the phenomenon is often called the " @entity112 , " he said , because the moisture originates near the @entity111			0
the series will affect the region through wednesday , with the strongest portions yet to come , @entity109 said saturday			0
rainfall amounts could reach 10 to 12 inches in some spots , and up to 18 inches in some isolated areas , he said			1
the storms could be the strongest to hit southern @entity15 since january 2005 , he said , when up to 32 inches of rain came in a five - day period			1
on saturday , there were more than 260 freeway crashes in @entity123 and unincorporated areas because of the rain , said @entity127 officer @entity126			1
that is compared to 48 last saturday , when it was not raining , he said			0
most of the crashes were " minor fender benders , " he said , but two people died in a crash in @entity134			0
" we think the driver was just going too fast in that case , " he said			0
about 5,000 customers lost power in southern @entity15 , said @entity141 of @entity142 , but noted that is a small percentage of the company 's 5.4 million customers			1
the biggest problem the company faced on saturday was drivers traveling too fast and sliding into poles , causing some service interruptions , @entity141 said			0
the company serves some of the mountain areas , and have crews in place there , he said			0
" overall , we 're in good shape			0
" about 2,100 customers lost power early sunday in the @entity161 area of @entity60 , but power had been restored as of about 6:30 sunday morning , said @entity163 , spokeswoman for the @entity164			0
the outages were likely weather related , she said			0
further north , high winds affected @entity168 , downing trees and power lines , and knocking out power to about 100,000 people			0
most of those had been restored as of sunday			0
footage from @entity176 , @entity177 , showed drivers crashing as they slid down a snowy hill			0
besides the potential for road closures , air travel could be affected in cities including @entity184 ; @entity123 ; @entity168 ; @entity185 , @entity186 ; and @entity187 , @entity43 said			0
those delays could have a ripple effect elsewhere as a busy holiday travel week approaches			0
