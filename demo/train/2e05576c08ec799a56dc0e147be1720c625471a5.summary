-- there 's no doubt that @entity3 know a little something about love			1
the superstar r&b group even used the word as the title of their new album			1
" @entity16 " is their second project of cover tunes and also marks another go - round working with " @entity14 " judge @entity13 , who was a producer on the successful " @entity15 : a journey through @entity18			1
" the group covers a variety of love tunes , including @entity17 's " open arms , " the @entity24 ' " @entity23 , " and " @entity25 " by the @entity26			1
@entity3 clearly still loves performing , as they spend most of the year on the road thrilling fans with their classic hits like " @entity31 " and " @entity32			1
" members @entity33 and @entity35 ( fellow member @entity36 was sick with the @entity38 virus ) spoke with @entity0 about their latest musical endeavor , what music puts them in the mood and whether fans should expect a reunion with former member @entity45			1
@entity0 : why name the album " love ? " @entity33 : the title embodies everything that @entity3 represents			1
every album we have ever done has always had a representation of love			1
we tried to reach and delve inside of this album and to not just go with the sound , but also the lyrical content that embodies that representation of love @entity0 : @entity3 has been around for almost 20 years			1
how has the music business changed ? @entity35 : a lot of people do n't understand that music conforms to the day and times that it is in			2
it is a circular motion , but it never comes back exactly the same			0
we believe that the soul , the understanding , of true music has kind of disappeared			2
there was a time early in the ' 70s and the ' 80s when we started getting into the computers and synthesizers that we started getting away from it then , too			0
right now , with the auto - tune and all of these different pro tools , we are kind of getting away from it again			0
this album is the type of album that will hopefully try to steer some of those musical people back in the direction of true music			1
@entity0 : there do n't really seem to be any @entity80 groups out right now representing like @entity3 has in the past			1
why do you think that is ? @entity33 : groups are hard to come by			0
a lot of times , when a group is put together by an entity or a manager , [ the members ] never really had aspirations of being in a group			2
with our group , music put us together			1
we were not contrived by a manager			0
we loved the way we sounded together , even before we liked each other			0
@entity0 : how has @entity3 changed ? @entity35 : we have definitely grown in more ways than one			1
we have children now , some of us wives and relationships			0
we 're very big believers in learning and trying to gain as much wisdom as we can			0
we 've had some ups and downs in our careers , just like people have in their lives , and it 's set in a situation mentally where we understand our position in life			0
@entity0 : what 's the biggest lesson you both have learned as entertainers ? @entity35 : to stay consistent			0
it 's ok to move with the times , but stay consistent with who you are , not just because of who you are , but because of who your fans fell in love with			2
we try to be different , but we try not to sway too far from who our fans know us to be because you ca n't gain those people back if you lose them			0
@entity0 : what 's the first single from the new album ? @entity33 : the first single we are pushing for is " @entity135 , " originally done by @entity136			2
we wanted to stay true to our roots , and it 's a very beautiful song			0
and with our sound , we gave it an @entity80 twist			1
it 's always been a favorite of ours , and we hope people will fall in love with it again			1
@entity0 : is it difficult to cover songs that are so beloved and have been hugely successful ? @entity35 : oh yes			1
there are so many people that have listened to these songs and fallen in love with the song as it was originally performed			2
we know that these songs have a fan base			2
we try to put our interpretation with how we think the song should be without swinging too far away from the solid concrete melody			0
@entity33 : integrity is important			0
just like someone doing " @entity31			0
" if they take it so far away from what people know , the fans want to know , " why did they do that ? " @entity0 : your music has set the mood for so many fans			2
what do you listen to when you want to get in the mood ? @entity33 : @entity175 , the @entity176 , anything with a nice feel			0
@entity35 : anything lovely and sexy			0
i always tell people that everybody 's feelings about love are different			2
it 's funny because you take a language like @entity188 that only has one word to describe " love , " while a language like @entity191 has four or five			0
that gives you the understanding that love can mean so many different things to different people			0
@entity0 : any upcoming plans for an album of original material ? @entity35 : late , late next year , we are planning on releasing a @entity3 20th anniversary album , which we are hoping to be a double cd			1
there 's a slim chance that our fourth member of the group will be back for that album .			1

@entity3 have a new album of cover tunes , their second
" @entity16 " features the @entity80 group singing love songs from various artists
the group will soon **celebrate** 20 years in the music *industry*
they hope to **celebrate** their anniversary with a double cd , reunion with former member
