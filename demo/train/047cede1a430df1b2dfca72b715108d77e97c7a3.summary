-- " real photographers do n't take photographs , they make photographs , " says @entity1 , who is widely regarded as one of the world 's great yachting photographers			2
the feisty 96 - year - old @entity8 should know			1
a pioneer in her field , she is credited with being the first yachting photographer to shun the safety of the tripod and compose her pictures while dangling off the side of a boat -- all in quest for the ultimate action shot			2
" other photographers would stand in the middle of their boats taking pictures of big yachts with plate cameras , so i developed my own style -- taking my pictures as close to the water as possible , " recalls @entity1			1
water - level photography , now an industry standard , quickly became her signature shot , but it was neither easy nor cheap			1
while adamant that she never dropped one of her @entity36 - made @entity35 cameras overboard , the saltwater took its toll on her equipment nonetheless			1
" i used to make sure i shielded the camera under my buttoned - up anorak , but the saltwater would still get to it			1
even though i cleaned them after each session , they would quickly get stiff because of all the salt , " says @entity1 , whose career has been immortalized in a new book by fellow photo - journalist and @entity8 @entity45			1

" it only took so long because @entity56 was so prolific			0
she kept immaculate records of her work and she remembers every photograph she 's ever taken , which meant that she would immediately pick up on things if i did n't get it right , " says @entity45 , a former yachting correspondent who now runs a photo agency that specializes in nautical photography			2
drawn to picture - taking from a young age , @entity1 began her professional career in 1937 as a 22 - year - old receptionist at a photography studio outside @entity70			1
but as war clouds gathered across @entity74 and the call to arms began , the owner of the studio discovered that his personal services would be required to record the impending conflict , so he gave each of his staff a camera and told them to go out and take some " interesting " photographs			2
the one to come back with the best pictures would take over the studio in his absence during the war			0
" i did n't know anything about cameras then , but my pictures were judged the best and i got the job , " says @entity1 , who spent the war years honing her skills in portrait photography by taking pictures of soldiers and their girlfriends			2
after the war she decided to go at it alone and set up her own studio in @entity70 , taking on any commissions that came her way from magazines and newspapers			0
in 1953 , she and her boyfriend decided to move closer to the ocean , and after purchasing a 28 foot ( 8.5 meter ) ex-royal air force boat that they moored at the end of their garden , she set out to make her mark in the nautical world			0
@entity116 enjoyed a post-war explosion in @entity118 , and it was during the 1950s and 60s that @entity1 's yachting photography career really took off			1
it 's this period that @entity45 has tried to capture in his book			0

her early pictures of our sailing pioneers have great significance when recording @entity118 's sailing history , " says @entity45 , adding that grown men were " moved to tears " at the sight of her original photos , which he brought to a boat exhibition last year			1
" all these people were gobsmacked , they could n't believe these photos existed			0
they kept spotting themselves as children as they flicked through her albums , " says @entity45			0
as for @entity1 , she is not fazed by her new moniker as the " @entity54 "			0
" i knew i was original back then , " she says bluntly , before adding : " you know , when you are 96 years of age , nothing can really faze you			0
