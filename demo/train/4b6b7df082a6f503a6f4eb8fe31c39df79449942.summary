-- @entity1 found out last june she had an aggressive form of breast cancer and needed surgery -- immediately			1
@entity1 , 59 , found out just days before her mastectomy that her insurance provider would not cover the procedure			1
her insurance carrier precertified her for a double mastectomy and hospital stay			1
but three days before the operation , the insurance company called and told her they had red - flagged her chart and she would not be able to have her surgery			1
the reason ? in may 2008 , @entity1 had visited a dermatologist for acne			1
a word written on her chart was interpreted to mean precancerous , so the insurance company decided to launch an investigation into her medical history			2
@entity1 's dermatologist begged her insurance provider to go ahead with the surgery			1
" he said , ' this is a misunderstanding			0
all she has is acne			0
' ... he said , ' please do n't hold up her cancer surgery for this , ' " @entity1 , 59 , said as she testified at a @entity35 subcommittee hearing on the terminations of individual health policies by insurance companies			1
still , the insurance carrier decided to rescind her coverage			2
the company said it had reviewed her medical records and found out that she had misinformed them about some of her medical history			0
@entity1 had listed her weight incorrectly			1
she also did n't disclose medication she had taken for a pre-existing heart condition -- medicine she was n't taking when she originally applied for coverage			0
" i did n't know what to do			0
the hospital wanted a $ 30,000 deposit			0
i did n't have that kind of money , " @entity1 said through tears			1
" can you imagine , having to walk around with cancer growing in your body ? with no insurance			2
it 's the most terrifying thing in the world to not have anybody to turn to or anywhere to go			2
" @entity1 , who worked as a registered nurse for three decades , charged that the insurance company " searched high and low " to pull out anything on her so that they would not have to pay for her surgery			1
@entity1 turned to @entity70 rep. @entity69 for help			1
@entity69 said his staff went to work , but the insurance company , he said , was " unyielding			2
" @entity69 appealed to the company 's president , who promised to investigate personally			2
the president called @entity69 back within four hours and said the coverage would be reinstated			0
@entity1 underwent surgery in october , but by then her tumor had grown from two to three centimeters to seven			1
she had to have all the lymph nodes removed in her arm			0
@entity1 is one of more than 16 million @entity83 who have individual health insurance policies			1
she and two others testified tuesday about their experiences with insurance rescission			2
the witnesses charged that insurance applications are purposely long and confusing , and that companies look for any discrepancy to avoid covering expensive treatments			2
the hearing , which was a result of a yearlong congressional investigation in the individual insurance market , examined " post-claims underwriting , " a process by which insurance carriers cancel an individual 's policy after providers submit claims for medical services they received			1
" overall , what we found is that the market for individual health insurance in the @entity83 is fundamentally flawed , " said rep. @entity105 , the chairman of the @entity106			1
one of the witnesses , @entity112 , said her coverage was canceled after her carrier said she did not disclose that she had taken a drug prescribed for weight loss and because of her irregular menstrual cycle			0
her carrier sent her a letter saying they would not have accepted her had they known she had " polycystic ovaries , " a condition she did not know she had			0
@entity121 testified on behalf of her brother , who was diagnosed with stage four @entity125 's type lymphoma			2
in the midst of his chemotherapy treatment , his coverage was rescinded and he was not able to receive the stem cell transplant needed to save his life			2
@entity121 's brother was told his coverage was canceled for failing to disclose that , unknown to him , a doctor had once noted in his file that a ct scan showed a small aneurysm and some insignificant gallstones			2
@entity121 worked with the @entity140 attorney general 's office and eventually was able , after two appeals , to get her brother 's coverage reinstated			0
insurance companies argue rescissions are relatively rare , but @entity105 said the practice saved the companies $ 300 million over the past five years			1
@entity105 said he and the insurers agree the solution to the rescission problem is to pass comprehensive health reform legislation			0
the @entity152 of @entity153 , @entity155 ' @entity154 and @entity157 's @entity156 also testified at the hearing			1
@entity159 , the ceo of @entity153 , said his company regrets the " necessity of even a single rescission			0
" he said the company has a fair rescission investigation process : when the company becomes aware of a pre-existing condition that was not disclosed on a person 's application , a senior underwriter reviews the information to determine if the omission was " material " to the underwriting decision			1
a manager verifies the analysis			0
if the omission was not material , the review is complete , but if it was , the application goes to a review panel , which includes a physician			0
the panel evaluates the information and makes a decision			0
the amount of the claim is not revealed to the panel , @entity182 said			0
there also are multiple opportunities for a person to appeal -- including by means of an independent review panel , he said			0
@entity191 , the ceo of @entity154 , noted that rescission " has long been recognized by the laws of virtually every state			0
" " @entity195 is uncommon , but unfortunate , and a necessary recourse in the event of material , and at times intentional or fraudulent , misstatement or omission on an insurance application , " he said			0
less than one - half of 1 percent of individual insurance policies were terminated or rescinded , he said			1
@entity204 , president and ceo of @entity156 , said @entity157 is proposing a set of rescission regulations with new consumer protections			0
" in addition , the health insurance industry has proposed a set of comprehensive and interrelated reforms to the individual health insurance market as a whole			1
the centerpiece of this proposal is the elimination of medical underwriting , combined with an effective and enforceable personal coverage requirement , " he said			0
members of the subcommittee grilled the @entity152 on their rescission policies -- including the fact that some companies will not take on clients who have had insurance rescinded in the past -- but the companies maintained that rescission is not about cost			1
asked if they would commit to never rescinding a policy unless it was intentionally fraudulent , all of the @entity152 said no , noting that a commitment like that does not coincide with the state laws and regulations they follow			1
" does n't it bother you that people are going to die because you insist on reviewing a policy that somebody took out in good faith and forgot to tell you that they were being treated for acne ? " @entity69 asked the panel of @entity152			1
" yes sir , it does , and we regret the necessity that that has to occur even a single time , and we 've made suggestions that would reform the system such that that would no longer be needed , " @entity182 replied			0
@entity0 's @entity254 contributed to this report .			0
