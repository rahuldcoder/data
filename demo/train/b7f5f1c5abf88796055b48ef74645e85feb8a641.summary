-- last week , we clued you in to all the annoying things that couples must cease doing on @entity5			1
this week , we 're taking a look at the other side of the coin			1
what should you do about all the digital remnants of a relationship when you 're no longer flitting through fields , holding hands and weaving flowers @entity15 - like into one another 's various expanses of hair ? ( i.e. , after you 've broken up			1
) a quick story that 's not specifically true but is likely true for many a person : @entity21 has a new beau , @entity22 , and they are , oh , so in love			2
like , two straws , one milkshake in love			2
and @entity21 detests sharing because she 's an only child , so you know that 's big			2
naturally , the two become @entity5 friends , because , well , the site has 900 million users and based on lord @entity37 's official decree , you do n't actually know anyone until you click " friend			1
" @entity21 is happily clicking through @entity22 's pictures and scrolling through his timeline when she notices a girl named @entity43 has commented on quite a few snaps and left wall posts with some quite explicit descriptions of what she wants to do to his sloped - shoulder physique			2
@entity21 is thrown into a rage that only the most only of only children can make manifest , then she realizes that the posts are from two years back			1
the next time she and @entity22 are slurping some frozen milk she asks for the story , and @entity22 reveals that @entity43 was his old flame , a college sweetheart who has long since lost the sweetness and acquired a whip ( the accessory of choice for anyone in her rather dominating profession )			2
@entity21 heaves a sigh of relief but still finds herself haunted by @entity43 's vinyl - swaddled ghost , wondering what @entity68 had that she lacks , and what macabre moves @entity22 might be into			2
the couple splits over ( banana ) splits just weeks later			2
it 's a science - proven fact ( or , at least , there 's a study supporting it ) : social networks like @entity5 increase jealousy , partly because information is much more accessible , and that information can often be ambiguous			1
our lives are now on display for all the world to see , but often we 're not there to explain ourselves when our most loved of loved ones are perusing			2
that 's why we 're suggesting this week that our readers do a little bit of a purge			0
you likely have years ' worth of romantic failure riddled throughout your @entity5 profile -- old pictures , wall posts , comments , messages -- and it 's not really a good look			1
it 's basically the digital equivalent of having a box of your ex 's stuff , but instead of hiding it in your closet , you 're displaying it in your living room for all visitors and cable men to see			0
and see it they will -- a recent study by @entity111 shows that 60 % of respondents look at romantic interests ' @entity5 profiles daily			1
we get that you might want to hold onto some of these memories			0
we would n't ask you to throw away every old love letter or snapshot in your closet , but there 's a more discrete way to do so			1
download your @entity5 profile for safekeeping			1
that way you 'll have a record of all photos , messages , wall posts and comments you may have received from a former beau			0
once you have done so , it 's time to wipe that slate clean once and for all			0
here 's how : 1 )			0
put your status in stealth do n't go down the winding road that is " making it @entity5 official " in the first place , even though most couples reportedly do			1
not only is changing your status back after the breakup horrible and humiliating , @entity136 makes it way too easy to scroll back and see activity like relationship reduxes			1
when it comes to what the sitcoms whimsically call " @entity143 , " let your mouth do the talking , not some post from june 4 , 2011			0
note : it 's totally fine to change your status to " married , " since that 's likely not changing any time soon ( we hope )			0
however , apparently close to 50 % of brides ( of those surveyed ) do so before the wedding , which we would n't recommend			1
cold feet , anyone ? 2 )			0
@entity155 , untag , untag after you take any and all pictures of you and your former off of @entity5 ( this is kind of a given , why would anyone keep public pics of long - dead lip locks on public display ? ) , untag pictures where the two of you look cozy from friends ' galleries			1
you might even want to ask pals to take them down wholesale			0
as we said , you do n't have to get rid of said pics ( download your profile or particular pictures ) , but no one wants to see their new hand - holder holding hands with someone old			1
silence old comments we 're not suggesting that you go through every picture and post and purge your ex 's exclamations , but perhaps deep six any lengthy epistles or outpourings of love			0
if your new squeeze is turned off by an errant comment on an early college snap in which you 're sporting flared jeans and pigtails , s / he 's probably too jealous anyway			0
and blind , apparently , because that rhinestone top you 're wearing is the real mood killer			0
unfriend exes now this is a tough one			0
a lot of you out there purport to be friends with your ex. we believe you			0
we 've seen such cases with our own jaded eyes			0
but you are not , my friend , pals with each and every person you 've ever dated , so why are they still hanging around on @entity5 , liking your snaps and writing " haha " on your most witty of witty posts ? here 's a good litmus test : do you refer to these " friends " as " my ex so and so " or " my friend so and so ? " if it 's the former -- and you never actually hang with this person @entity218 -- it 's time to kill this digital sham of a friendship .			1

social networks like @entity5 increase jealousy because information is more accessible
study shows 60 % of respondents look at romantic interests ' @entity5 profiles daily
first hint ? do n't make your relationship official on @entity5 at the beginning
