@entity0 let 's get the news out of the way to begin with			2
there is n't any news on whether @entity7 is going to run for president again			1
that is n't to say there are n't those who want him to run			1
@entity1 's @entity13 reports advisers are rooting for him to consider it			2
he 's not sold on the idea			2
regardless of what goes on behind closed doors , what we do know for sure is he has said he wo n't do it			1
so why does he keep creeping his way into headlines and onto campaign stages ? he 's 67 , just a year older than @entity27 , and he appears to continue to be in great shape			2
both @entity7 and @entity29 would be about the same age as @entity31 was when he was first inaugurated			1
age probably is n't an issue			2
will @entity7 take the plunge again ? so herewith , three reasons @entity7 is going to run for president : 1			1
he 's doing interviews with the @entity39 : in a new profile published this week in the @entity41 , @entity7 is asked about running for president again			1
he makes a joke about a scene in the movie " @entity47 " when @entity46 , asking a woman if she 's interested in him , is told his chances are 1 in a million			2
" so there 's a chance ? " @entity46 's character says in the movie			0
" there 's a chance , " @entity7 told the @entity39 , apparently while doing a @entity46 impression			1
but he did n't sound 1 in a million dismissive when he added : " we 've got a lot of people looking at the race			2
we 'll see what happens			0
" this latest version of " no " is a lot different than the flatter , more definitive " nos " he was giving not too long ago			0
the @entity65 examined all the different ways @entity7 has said " no " and discovered a softening of the resolve			1
he wo n't go away : @entity7 is n't just on the campaign trail for @entity70 in 2014 , he 's on the campaign trail with regularity			1
he 's helping candidates large and small and he 's helping the party raise money			0
he 's traveling to @entity76 and @entity77 and he 's helping out @entity78 in @entity79			0
these are not the activities of a man who is done with public life			0
this is a man who is still in demand from his party and still wants to contribute			0
but as @entity89 of the @entity90 said on @entity1 's " @entity91 " tuesday , it 's not clear if he 's in so demand by @entity70 because he is their top star or because no one has stepped into the void in a party with no clear leader			0
he was right : okay , whether he was actually right or not is and will remain the matter of some dispute , just like the campaign itself			0
but in the midst of a tough second term for president @entity105 , @entity7 can point to issues as varied as terror , @entity108 and tensions with @entity110 and argue that what he said on the campaign trail back in 2012 now seems prescient			1
how to campaign without campaigning but for every reason @entity7 would run , there is an equally convincing reason he wo n't			1
here are four : 1			0
the 47 % is still there : it was the turning point in the presidential campaign when @entity7 spoke the truth that about 47 % of @entity121 were going to vote against him no matter what			1
who knows if the exact number is still 47 % , but it is about half the country			0
there 's no doubt @entity121 have some buyer 's remorse with @entity105 in his second term			0
a @entity1 / @entity133 poll in july found that 53 % of @entity121 would support @entity7 against @entity105 in a hypothetical match - up			1
of course , @entity105 ca n't run again			1
in that same poll , 55 % would have supported @entity29 over 42 % for @entity7			1
her numbers have settled since then , but the point remains			0
@entity7 looks good to @entity121 in hindsight			1
he might look different if he actually started running again			0
running for president is hard : it 's really hard to give up your life and spend most of your time flying across the country , sleeping in hotels and fund - raising			2
the rest of the time you spend giving speeches and glad - handing			0
the @entity151 documentary " @entity7 , " released earlier this year , did a good job of documenting that toll			1
you could see it on the exhausted face of his wife , @entity156 , and on the faces of his children			0
we 're not privy to private @entity7 family discussions , but you 've got to wonder if he would want to start up the family machine again			1
he 's run and lost twice already : in that @entity151 documentary , @entity7 put it well			1
" i have looked at what happens to anybody in this country who loses as the nominee of their party , " he says			0
" they become a loser for life " and are " brutalized " by the public			0
@entity7 has now lived that reality			1
a third run would be almost unprecedented			2
as the son of a man who ran for president and having now done it twice himself , @entity7 must be keenly aware of legacy			1
a win would instantly erase all stigma from his previous losses			0
a third straight loss would make his name synonymous with defeat			0
he 'd have a primary : @entity7 lost the crowded 2008 primary and won the crowded primary in 2012			2
there 's no question he 'd have to win another crowded primary in 2016			2
@entity76 sen. @entity195 , @entity77 gov. @entity196 , @entity198 gov. @entity197 and @entity200 sen. @entity199 are all seriously considering runs			0
each of those men has a compelling campaign story			0
@entity7 would have to convince @entity121 to choose him over one of these new guys who has n't had a chance yet			1
that could end up being a tough argument to make			0
@entity196 builds profile as he eyes 2016 presidential run			2

@entity7 has said he wo n't run for president again
but that has n't *tamped* down 2016 *speculation*
for every reason he would run , there are other reasons he wo n't
