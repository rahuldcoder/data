-- searchers in @entity2 say they have found and identified the wreck of a fighter jet that disappeared into the @entity5 near @entity6 nearly 54 years ago			1
searchers found the wreckage of a @entity9 on the @entity11 floor			1
the jet disappeared in 1955			1
the searchers were looking for another missing plane when they came upon the wreckage of a @entity17 jet trainer , said @entity18 , an aircraft archeologist who has identified about 3,700 crash sites and visited more than 800			1
" it 's a funky thing , " @entity18 said tuesday			1
" you 're looking for one aircraft , and you find another			1
" the @entity17 disappeared shortly after taking off on an early - morning training navigation flight october 15 , 1955 , an @entity23 says			1
the plane had been presumed lost at sea all these years			1
the discovery started this year near @entity29 , @entity30 , where computer expert @entity31 found " what looked like a few little pixels " on a high - definition @entity35 image of the @entity11 ocean floor			1
@entity31 is the founder of a group of unpaid sleuths who discovered a missing @entity40 off the @entity2 coast in 2003			0
the group , known as @entity43 , has continued to search for other wrecks			0
before moving to @entity30 , @entity31 became interested in military aircraft wrecks and found @entity18 about five years ago in @entity46 , @entity2			1
@entity18 told him about his search for the wreckage of a @entity50 fighter flown by @entity53 's @entity52 pilot @entity51			1
the plane was presumed lost at sea in 1944			2
of the 38 @entity57 pilots who lost their lives in @entity59 , @entity18 said , @entity51 's is the only wreckage that has not been found			1
@entity18 has been searching for the wreckage for 11 years			0
silver 's 100 - year - old sister lives in @entity64 , @entity18 said , and he would like to find the wreckage so she can know what happened			1
from @entity30 , @entity31 sent the map info to @entity68 , owner and operator of a southern @entity2 dive company and a fellow member of @entity43			0
@entity68 and some his employees set out to search three wrecks using side - scan sonar			2
two turned out to be boats			0
they were n't sure about the third			0
" i just grabbed a tank and went down to look at it , " @entity68 said			0
he saw a fairly compact debris field with a lot of aluminum , which indicated that it was an airplane			0
then he saw landing gear			0
" ' it 's an airplane , ' i said to myself			2
' how do we go from here ? ' " a manufacturer 's number on a feed mechanism for a 50 - caliber machine gun started him and the others toward piecing together what they had found			1
the engine appeared to be a jet , so he knew it was n't the @entity50 , which had a propeller motor			2
by that point , @entity68 said , " we know it 's not what we 're looking for			2
" the manufacturer 's number indicated that it was a @entity17			2
researching government documents , the searchers found that a @entity17 had disappeared in the area			1
" it just matched what we had , " @entity68 said			0
" the @entity17 was it			0
" that was about a month ago			0
the searchers kept quiet about their find until family members could be notified			2
@entity18 said he spoke with a relative of one of the two crew members a few days ago			0
the @entity23 accident report identifies the pilots as lt. @entity117 and lt. @entity118			1
@entity117 had 1,244 hours of flying experience , and @entity118 had 430			0
another volunteer group called @entity121 also helped find the wreckage			2
the searchers had another reason for initially keeping silent about their find			2
" we 're trying to quietly do this stuff and move on so the sites do n't get ravaged , " @entity68 said			0
the group also found a b - 36 peacemaker bomber near @entity129 last year			1
the plane disappeared in 1952			1
for the three searchers , finding wrecks is an unpaid passion			2
" we do this fairly consistently , " said @entity68 , 61			0
" as amateurs , this is our form of recreation			0
" said @entity31 with a laugh , " it 's an absolutely money - losing proposition			1
" @entity31 , 46 , is an ex-sports fisherman who says he has an " obsession " with the water and an " interest in the maritime history of @entity2			0
" @entity18 , 64 , says he got interested in aircraft wrecks in the 1960s when he found a crash site while working in a boy scout camp in the @entity149			1
there are 2,500 crash sites in @entity2 , he said , where all or parts of an airplane still remain			0
