@entity0 is associate professor of politics and african - american studies at @entity3			1

@entity0 says @entity13 's speech fell short of calling for real action against racism			1
@entity16 , @entity17 ( @entity18 ) -- on wednesday , attorney general @entity13 marked @entity19 with an address at the @entity21			1
@entity13 clearly and courageously acknowledged the history of @entity24 racism			1
he forthrightly argued that , " to get to the heart of this country , one must examine its racial soul			2
" because public officials so rarely discuss race , @entity13 's was an unusually bold statement			1
but ultimately , @entity13 's discussion of race in @entity33 was a failure			1
it failed because @entity13 spoke more like a grade school principal than like the attorney general of the @entity33			1
he framed our nation 's continuing racial work as a struggle to feel comfortable , be tolerant , and have " frank conversations about racial matters			1
" i appreciate the sentiment , but i would prefer @entity13 use the @entity21 to sue those who illegally discriminate against racial minorities rather than holding encounter sessions in the lunchroom			1
february 's celebration of black history is important because it reminds us that @entity33 's bitter racial legacy is not about name calling and hurt feelings ; it is about structures of inequality codified in law and supported by government action			1
black men and women risked their lives to gain the right to vote , to live where they chose , to educate their children in the best public schools , and to end segregation in transportation and public places			0
black political history is the story of a battle against structures			0
unfortunately , too many of those structures still exist			0
as attorney general , @entity13 is charged , in part , with eliminating those violations of law that still create systematic racial inequality			1
in @entity13 's optimistic portrayal of modern @entity33 , we are a nation fundamentally altered by @entity81 ; a country that has " done a pretty good job melding the races in the workplace ; " and a nation whose biggest racial obstacle is making our weekend socializing as congenial as our workweek happy hours			1
maybe @entity13 does n't realize that in many cities and towns the public schools are more segregated today than they were 40 years ago			1
a recent report from the @entity93 found that @entity24 children in the city are almost exclusively educated in schools that are more than 85 percent black			0
these vastly predominantly black schools have fewer resources , fewer extracurricular activities and fewer experienced teachers than their white counterparts			0
children from these schools are more likely to drop out or end up incarcerated than to enroll in college			0
segregation is no longer the law of the land , but @entity33 's children continue to be educated in separate and unequal schools			2
we ca n't talk our way out of unequal schools			2
@entity13 's perspective that black and white workers get along easily in the workplace reflects a shocking disregard for contemporary employment realities			1
african - americans continue to suffer from extraordinary employment discrimination at every stage of hiring and promotion and in every sector of the job market			1
for example , my @entity3 colleague , sociologist @entity126 , has demonstrated that white men with criminal records are more likely to be considered for a job than black men with no criminal past			0
i am deeply concerned that the leader of the @entity21 seems to believe that our workplaces need dialogue , discourse , and understanding rather than fair hiring practices , equal pay , and transparent promotion procedures			2
we ca n't talk our way out of employers who refuse to interview a job candidate if the name on the résumé " sounds black			2
" @entity13 discussed weekend segregation as if it is just a matter of personal recreational choice : white folks go off to @entity151 and black people prefer to watch basketball			2
but the reason @entity33 do not share racial vocabulary or opportunities for interracial dialogue is because of deeply entrenched racial residential segregation			2
we do n't spend our weekends together because we do n't live in the same neighborhoods			0
housing segregation is not just a matter of personal choice			0
some real estate agents steer black families away from predominantly white neighborhoods			0
some property owners refuse to rent to black families			0
both of these acts are illegal			0
in fact , the @entity170 documents hundred of thousands of acts of housing discrimination each year and has repeatedly criticized the @entity21 for failing to adequately pursue and prosecute the vast majority of these cases			0
we ca n't talk our way out of residential segregation			0
as a teacher , i am deeply committed to interracial dialogue			0
i try to use my classroom as a site of conversation , deliberation , and debate about race			0
i do this because , as a teacher , dialogue is the most powerful weapon i have in the fight to build a better @entity33			0
i do n't want my attorney general to scold me about having conversations ; i want him to tell me the lawsuits he plans to file against those who continue to practice educational , employment , and housing discrimination			1
i appreciate attorney general holder for taking up a conversation on race , but it is not enough			1
the time for talking may come , but today is a day for action			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			2

@entity0 : @entity13 's speech was ultimately a failure
she says it was courageous for the attorney general to talk about race
rather than seek racial dialogue , she says , @entity13 should have called for action
@entity222 - @entity0 : discrimination is *rampant* and needs to be addressed
