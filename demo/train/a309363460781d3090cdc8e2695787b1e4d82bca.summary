@entity0 -- @entity2 concluded yesterday , and the trendy , well - heeled set can finally rest their aching feet -- at least for the flight across the pond to @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 to wash , rinse and repeat it all over again			1
with the debut of more than 100 spring 2014 collections over the course of seven days , it 's ambitious to declare a definitive motif , but there were certainly a number of recurring looks that achieved majority rule			1
comfortable , wispy , feminine and monochromatic are just a few ways to describe the spring 2014 collections that were showcased at events in @entity24 and throughout the city			1
@entity1 was on the ground to document the looks that will put a spring in your step come next year			2
interactive : what 's trending at @entity2 participating designers ran the gamut , from the powerhouses that showed on the final day like @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 to up - and - comers creatures of the @entity39 and @entity40			1
also making a splash were street - style favorites like @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 , started by @entity46 and @entity47			2
prior to the shows , we caught up with fashion forecaster @entity50 and @entity53 's fashion news director @entity52 to place their bets on what consumers will see in stores in six months -- and their predictions were , collectively , on the button			0
casting the outcast at @entity2 " i suspect we will see a continuation of resort ( wear ) -- big florals , art - inspired prints , offbeat pastel combinations and architecturally minded separates and sportswear - inspired ideas , " @entity52 said , prior to the whirlwind week			2
@entity68 of fashion forecaster @entity50 agreed that we should keep an eye out for bold prints and patterns -- florals , plaids , etc. -- meanwhile the silhouettes would remain sleek and architectural			0
designers also favored the bare midriffs -- crop top until you drop , if you will -- as well as cut - outs and sheer fabrics to reveal some skin amid more ladylike pieces , like below - the - knee hemlines			1
the fine line between lingerie and outwear @entity52 's resort - wear prediction proved prescient : @entity88 took attendees to @entity90 ; he even experimented with neoprene and constructed waistbands in some of his skirts and shirts , which looked like peeled down wetsuits			0
the getaway theme also resonated in the @entity98 - inspired , lemon grove patterns of @entity99 and tropical flower - print dresses and straw fedoras of @entity104 's @entity103 nights - themed collection			0
also well - represented : short suits ; slip dresses and culottes			0
think classic @entity108 with a little boudoir flare			0
making an unlikely and comfortable comeback is the @entity113 sandal , offering a bit of 1990s nostalgia for the collections of @entity117 and @entity118 , as well as a new collaboration between the shoemaker and @entity121			1
yet , among all this , a mod black - and - white palette reigned supreme			0
@entity35 opened up with a monochromatic color scheme before transitioning into bright @entity125 , blue , orange and yellow gowns ; @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 also stayed minimalist in hue for most of their collections			1
as for the hair , it was matted down and sleek in most shows , while the makeup was understated and shimmering -- orange lipstick added a common pop of color at many shows			0
what was n't understated was the showmanship : from the rose - scented room of @entity147 to the models at @entity149 who showed off clothes amid luxury cars			1
at @entity154 , models cheekily walked and danced down the runway with smiles and peace sign gestures ; and at @entity159 , several models were even joined down the runway by similarly - coiffed @entity162 hounds			0
meanwhile , @entity163 went full - on " @entity164 " with corseted couture pieces paired with smeared red lipstick and teased out gray wigs			1
see all of @entity169 's @entity2 coverage			0
and catch up with us come spring for a look at the fall and winter collections .			2
