-- less than two weeks after the @entity3 cruise disaster , customers are still booking cruises for 2012 -- even as they ask more questions about safety at sea			1
the cruise industry is in the middle of its " wave season , " the first three months of the year when the majority of customers book their cruises			1
" while i 'm engaging in lots of conversations with customers , i 'm going to say -- knock on wood -- i have n't seen any negative effect on booking levels or trends as of yet , " said @entity19 , owner of @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , who focuses primarily on the luxury market			1
" the real worry is the younger market , the first - time cruisers			1
it 's still a little too early to see if there 's going to be any fallout			2
" he expects budget cruise lines to start aggressively discounting their fares to lure the hesitant first - time cruisers aboard			1
choosing ships subject to @entity40 regulations @entity42 owner @entity41 says she has n't had any cancellations of existing reservations			1
in fact , her bookings have increased over last year , and customers are booking @entity48 and @entity50 cruises			1
however , the @entity52 , @entity53 , agency owner notes that her clients are experienced cruisers who primarily sail on the luxury lines			1
@entity58 books her clients only on cruise lines where @entity60 is the ship 's primary language and on ships subject to @entity65 inspection			2
( neither was true of the @entity67			2
) " i think our customers have known through the years that these cruise lines have a really strong ethic with safety , " she said			0
safety drills are " the first thing that happens the minute they get on the ship			0
" cruise prices are actually up 1 % since the beginning of the year , according to the @entity79 released tuesday			0
cruise prices in the @entity81 and @entity48 are up moderately over the past few weeks , while @entity83 pricing has been stable since november			0
the impact of the @entity67 on pricing is still unclear , says @entity85 , editor of @entity86 , a trade industry publication			0
" it 's anyone 's guess right now , " @entity85 said			0
" it 's safe to say the lawyers in the cruise industry will be working overtime in the next few months			0
it 's just hard to predict right now , because it really is unprecedented			0
" cruise industry analyst @entity95 said he suspects that bookings have dropped while pricing has held steady because travelers who are concerned about safety are n't likely to be swayed by lower prices			2
" i think that if , in fact , bookings have slowed and they continue to be weak for another couple of weeks , i believe at that point , we may start to see prices come down , " said @entity95 , a director with @entity101			0
other factors may decrease demand @entity81 cruise lines , heavily dependent on cold weather to attract @entity40 customers tired of the snow , have seen bookings decline as warmer weather has kept people at home , @entity19 said			1
@entity83 cruise lines were already facing lower demand because of high @entity40 airfares to @entity119 and economic instability in @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity19 said			1
@entity58 notes that there are a lot of ships sailing in the @entity83 , which means bookings are being spread across many cruise lines			2
customers are asking more questions about safety drills and safety records , travel agents say			0
the fact that the @entity3 did n't conduct a same - day safety drill for passengers boarding the ship was surprising to some agents , and @entity19 says he expects more cruise lines to tighten their safety procedures and have drills before a ship sails			2
