-- while commentators have been impressed by @entity3 's single - mindedness in bringing @entity4 and the @entity5 back to the negotiating table , most are quite pessimistic about the prospect of reaching an agreement			1
one strong reason for this pessimism is @entity12 's basic worldview that he has held consistently since the 1980s			1
@entity12 believes @entity4 is at the forefront of the clash of civilizations between the @entity16 and @entity17 , and that the @entity19 world has not come to terms with @entity4 's existence			1
he thinks that the international community 's focus on the @entity4 - @entity5 conflict is shortsighted and wrongheaded			1
@entity12 also believes @entity4 's retreat to the 1967 borders will not solve the core issue			1
@entity4 will continue to be surrounded by a civilization that intends to erase @entity4 in the long run , his thinking goes , but it will lose strategic depth and be exposed to rocket attacks on its population centers			0
@entity4 's prime minister is a man with a dark world view that is guided by fears and suspicion			1
but not all of his fears can be dismissed as simple paranoia ; indeed some are based on historical precedents and have been corroborated to an extent by recent events			1
while the western world has understandably focused on the carnage @entity48 is inflicting on @entity50 's civil population , it has often disregarded the fact that many of the rebels are fundamentalist jihadists , and that @entity4 might find itself in a very difficult situation if these groups gain control over the border between @entity50 and @entity4			2
similarly radical jihadists have infiltrated the @entity59 and attacked @entity4 during the past year			0
but @entity4 's true nightmare is that @entity61 , already shaky , may at some point fall			2
if jihadists strengthen their foothold in the @entity64 , it 's not inconceivable the territory could fall into the hands of @entity67			0
@entity4 could be faced with rockets stationed no more than twenty kilometers from its population centers around @entity70 -- rockets that have already been used to attack @entity4 both from @entity71 and @entity72			0
if this is @entity12 's basic worldview , are we to expect nothing but another round of foot - dragging in the hope that the @entity5 will at some point leave the negotiations , presumably because @entity4 does n't stop building new settlements ? is this round of talk nothing but make - believe to appease the @entity83 ? there are reasons to think that @entity12 has realized that @entity4 's occupation of the @entity64 is untenable for @entity4 in the long run			1
the @entity89 's recent guidelines that forbid any sort of cooperation with @entity4 organizations and companies from the @entity64 bode darkly and open the possibility for wider sanctions against @entity4			2
the @entity89 funds @entity4 's research massively , and is @entity4 's largest trading partner			2
before these guidelines were published @entity12 met with a delegation of leading @entity4 businesspeople , some of them close friends of his , who warned him of the dire economic consequences of @entity4 's continued occupation of the @entity64			1
@entity12 is probably coming to the conclusion that @entity4 's economy can not continue to flourish while @entity4 is antagonizing the free world with the occupation			1
problems loom large with @entity83 , too			0
@entity12 's view has always been that he understands the @entity83 inside out -- that the liberal elites of the @entity113 coasts do not represent the real @entity83 , and that at heart the @entity83 will stand behind @entity4 not matter what			1
he also believed that he could manipulate @entity83 political opinion and make sure @entity4 's interests would be safeguarded under all circumstances			0
but @entity12 's wisdom has already taken a big hit			2
his political guru , @entity121 , had assured him that @entity122 would trounce @entity123 at the 2012 elections , and that obviously turned out to be wrong			0
the @entity83 security establishment has also made clear a number of times that @entity4 's occupation of the @entity64 is a serious strategic liability for the @entity83 , because it has become a symbol for the @entity17 world 's grievances against the @entity16			2
ending the @entity4 - @entity5 conflict is therefore a major strategic interest for the @entity83 does this mean then that the coming nine months will lead to a peace agreement with the @entity5 ? i want to hope so , because i am convinced that striving for the two - state solution is in @entity4 's vital political , strategic and moral interest , but i am pessimistic			1
@entity12 lacks a political base for a peace agreement			0
his @entity143 has moved substantially to the right and a majority of its @entity147 members oppose a @entity5 state			0
furthermore , any viable agreement with the @entity5 would require uprooting between eighty and one hundred thousand settlers from their homes			0
the settlers have proven for decades how much political clout they have , and many @entity4 look up to them as today 's true @entity155			0
@entity12 is loath to confront them head - on because they are his political allies , and because in his heart he ultimately identifies with their cause			0
adding to these challenges is the fact @entity12 is temperamentally risk - averse -- another factor which substantially lowers the odds that we are on the verge of peace			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

many are pessimistic about the outcome of the @entity175 peace talks , writes @entity170
he says a strong reason is because of @entity12 's " dark world view "
but some of his fears are based on historical precedents , writes @entity170
@entity184 : odds are low that @entity4 and @entity5 are on verge of peace
