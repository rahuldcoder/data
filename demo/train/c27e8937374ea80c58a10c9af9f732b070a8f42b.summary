-- my cousin @entity1 abruptly typed me the news while we were texting back and forth about other matters : a @entity7 football player killed his girlfriend , then went to the team 's practice facility and committed suicide in front of his head coach and general manager			1
left behind was the couple 's 3 - month - old daughter , who was in another room when her mother was shot multiple times			1
like so many @entity20 , we were stunned			0
we would learn later that player was @entity22 , 25 - year - old starting linebacker for the @entity7 , a man and an athlete spoken of in the highest regard by everyone from his high school teammates and coaches to his fellow professional football players			1
they , too , were stunned			0
indeed , what would lead a man who , by all accounts , loved family , friends and football and had overcome great odds to make the @entity38 as an undrafted pick out of the @entity40 to take such shocking actions ? a man raised by a single mother , he had achieved so much in such a short period that he had widely been considered a great role model for what could be done through hard work , grit and determination			0
a gun control halftime show : should @entity51 have spoken out on @entity22 suicide ? since the killing and suicide are so fresh , so recent , we do not really know what might have driven @entity22 to such extreme and horrific actions			1
but the knee - jerk reactions have been rampant on the social networks			0
" @entity60 " is a term being used to describe @entity22			1
but that is too easy , far too simplistic , and name - calling never solves a problem			0
@entity22 was a man living in the supersized macho world of football , a world in which many of us @entity20 males reside , be it football or not			1
too many of us have been taught manhood in a way that is not healthy			0
be tough , men do not cry , man up -- these are the things i 've heard my entire life , and i now cringe when i hear this relayed to boys or younger men by teachers , coaches , fathers , mentors and leaders			1
or we use derogatory and sexist or homophobic words to describe men or boys who do not meet the " normal " of what a male is supposed to be			2
some of these male authority figures mean well , or are simply repeating what they were socialized to be or to do , and do not realize that they are unwittingly teaching that manhood has little room to express hurt , disappointment and sorrow			0
yes , they had been arguing , @entity22 and his girlfriend , but in my work as an activist , including around gender violence prevention , i 've seen the tragic pattern across our nation of men who , in the heat of rage , have killed their girlfriends , wives or lovers , as if they had no other vocabulary or emotion to deal with the disagreement or the break - up			1
we can not forget @entity116 in this story			0
because when men behave in this manner , it also says , bluntly , that the life of a woman is of no value whatsoever			1
just the fact that much of the media has focused on @entity22 and barely mentions @entity116 by name speaks to this truth			1
in the late 1990s , after achieving some level of success from my years on @entity131 's " @entity130 " and as a feature writer for @entity134 ' @entity133 , i descended into a dark period that included excessive drinking , painful bouts with anxiety , stress and depression , and , yes , i thought often of committing suicide			1
i had been fired from @entity133			0
i had a terrible time coping with life back then , and i kept much of it to myself because we live in a world where men are not encouraged to express the hurts we feel			1
news : @entity38 @entity7 play after murder - suicide that is the problem for so many of us			2
we do not talk about much of anything , except sports , women and sex			0
everything else is routinely ignored			0
what eventually helped me get through those dark years , years that too were riddled with violence -- toward myself , toward others -- in various forms , was a renewed commitment to my spiritual foundation , a return to therapy in a very serious and consistent way , and surrounding myself with people , including men , who were willing and able to give me the safe space to talk about anything and everything			2
for the past several years , i have privately advised and counseled several professional and amateur athletes , and entertainers , all men , all grappling with very warped definitions of manhood			2
the recurring theme over and over is fear of expressing themselves fully , fear of letting others down , fear of not being the tough and rugged men they were told they had to be			2
and on the inside so many of them are damaged as a result			0
the very definition of manhood they 've embraced is more an emotional prison than anything else			0
this is probably why the one scene that is locked in for me is of @entity22 thanking his coach and general manager for what they did for him			1
then walking away and shooting himself in the head			0
we must struggle , harder than ever , as men , as boys , as a nation , to reach the point where a heart - to - heart conversation is the first and only option , not a gun , not gun violence			2
the lives of @entity22 and @entity116 will have been in vain completely if we do not go deeper within ourselves to teach and show our sons , our husbands , our boyfriends , our fathers , our men and boys , that there is another way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			2

@entity22 killed his girlfriend , then shot himself in front of team 's staff , *police* say
@entity223 : we do *n't* know what drove him to these *desperate* acts
@entity223 : in my own life , i fell into depression , thoughts of suicide after *setbacks*
he says we have to teach men to find ways to cope with life 's *challenges*
