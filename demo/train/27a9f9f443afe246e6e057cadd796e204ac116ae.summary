@entity0 -- a coroner in @entity3 has reaffirmed that @entity5 engineer @entity4 committed suicide -- a ruling that caps a two - month investigation and is at odds with his family 's contention that @entity4 was killed because of his work			1
soon after @entity4 was found hanging from the bathroom door in his @entity3 apartment on june 24 , 2012 , @entity3 's medical examiner concluded he had killed himself			1
but @entity4 's parents disagreed and hired a pathologist in the @entity5 who -- based on @entity3 's autopsy report and photographs of the body -- suggested there was evidence that his death was a homicide			1
the latest ruling by the coroner sides with the medical examiner 's assessment			1
" the cause of the deceased 's death was asphyxia due to hanging , " the coroner 's report said			2
" there was no foul play involved in the deceased 's death			0
the deceased had committed suicide by hanging himself			0
" in the report , released monday , state coroner @entity41 extended his condolences to @entity4 's family			1
" i hope that the family will be able to find closure and i wish them all the best , " the coroner said			2
murdered for his work ? the report is the end result of a 10 - day hearing into the death last month			0
in it , @entity41 said @entity4 had " entertained suicidal ideations of overall increasing severity " in the months leading up to his death			2
the @entity58 in @entity3 said the inquiry was " comprehensive , fair , and transparent			1
" " the coroner heard testimony from a wide range of witnesses in open court and received evidence in the form of written statements and records , " it said in a statement monday			0
the decision is unlikely to appease @entity4 's family			1
@entity1 was unable to reach them for a reaction early monday morning			0
@entity3 lawyers hired by the @entity4 family have suggested @entity3 's police work was sloppy and that an assumption of suicide led police to neglect other evidence			1
during inquiry proceedings last month , the @entity81 ' lawyers asserted a possible crime scene was altered : @entity4 's hanging body was cut down and laid on the floor and a nearby chair moved before a forensics team and photographer arrived			1
police maintain this follows standard procedure			0
the 31 - year - old @entity4 had been working for a year and a half at the @entity3 government 's @entity93 ( @entity95 ) when he decided to quit his job and return home to the @entity5			1
he was part of a team researching uses of @entity101 ( @entity101 ) , a semiconductor that can operate at extremely high temperatures			0
documents found on @entity4 's laptop after his death reportedly indicate @entity95 may have had plans with @entity109 telecom giant @entity108 to co-develop an amplifier using @entity101			1
such a device could have both military as well as civilian uses			0
@entity4 's parents believe their son may have been murdered over his knowledge of such a sensitive project			1
they say their son had warned them his life was in danger			2
both @entity95 and @entity108 deny that any joint @entity101 project ever went forward			0
' @entity122 to those around me ' on the night of june 24 , 2012 , @entity4 's girlfriend @entity125 , a nurse , discovered his body			1
she had gone to the apartment after he did n't answer calls or texts			0
during the court proceedings , @entity125 testified she did n't know the details of @entity4 's work but said @entity4 told her " how much he hated " it			1
on one occasion he told her he was " working on something that could get him into trouble with the @entity5 government " and that " heavy hands " were coming after him , though he did n't elaborate			2
but @entity4 had also confided in his girlfriend that he had been depressed since october 2011			0
but she said he " did not display any suicidal tendencies			0
" on his laptop , authorities found a two - page suicide note			0
" i am so sorry it has come to this but i feel i am just a burden to those around me			0
i have tried to get jobs in the @entity5 but i know i am not capable of fulfilling the duties required of me , " he said in one			0
what led to death ? in his report , the coroner says @entity4 did not possess confidential information from his work at @entity95 and the @entity101 project did not materialize			2
" at the time of his death , the major stressor in the deceased 's mind was unlikely to be his workload , " the coroner said			0
@entity4 had already put in his 60 - day notice to leave his job and his workload had decreased , " why then would the deceased commit suicide before he was due to return to the @entity5 ? " @entity41 posed in the report			1
he then hazards some guesses			0
@entity4 was concerned he wo n't be able to get @entity170 clearance for a new job " because of his perceived involvement in violating @entity5 security , the possibility , " and about his psychiatric condition , @entity41 wrote			2
" these concerns in all likelihood caused him to feel that his deep sense of failure ( which was magnified by his psychiatric anxiety ) would follow him back to the @entity5 , " the coroner concluded			2
" in the deceased 's mind , all these factors eventually outweighed the happy prospects of reuniting with his family in the @entity5 and culminated in his ultimate decision to take his own life			1
