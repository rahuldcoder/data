-- we who work to promote human rights operate in the realm of treaties , rule of law , and state responsibility			1
these are benchmarks of accountability that presume our world civilization has moved well beyond the horrors of the past : from the @entity16 destruction of the @entity17 through @entity18 and the @entity19 to the gas warfare of @entity21 such atrocities may have continued well into the 20th century with the @entity23 and @entity24 , but the @entity30 , the development of international humanitarian law and human rights conventions , and the establishment of international criminal courts signaled that justice for the worst crimes was possible			2
so we are dumbstruck when we confront the blatant and self - advertised brutality occurring in the parts of @entity35 and @entity36 that have fallen under the control of the so - called @entity38			2
there , the members of this group make no effort to hide their atrocities or even to make them look less atrocious			0
to the contrary , they advertise it and appear to relish their primitivism , showing a degree of sophistication only in their use of video technology and social media to document and disseminate evidence of their crimes			0
one of the key tools of the human rights trade is " naming and shaming , " by which we seek to expose wrongdoers to the opprobrium their crimes deserve , and ensure accountability			1
we have better and more fine - tuned instruments at our disposal now than ever before to investigate and document rights abuses , as well as more comprehensive legal mechanisms for holding accountable those who commit crimes against humanity and other serious violations			2
but what if those wrongdoers know no shame ? what if they are proud of their deeds , seeing them in some manner as an expression of @entity80 's will and not beholden to human law , even law that is universal in scope and application ? the fundamental challenge to our understanding of human rights abuse and how to counter such abuses is exemplified in the handful of accounts of @entity91 who survived the massacre in northern @entity35			1
from his hospital bed in @entity99 , one survivor with bullet wounds in his legs and pelvis recounted , " first they wanted us all to convert to @entity101 and we said yes just to save our lives			0
" then , he said , " they started shooting at us randomly			0
" he estimated that @entity38 militants massacred about 80 men and kidnapped the women and girls			0
the mind - set of the attackers seems to have been to eradicate the @entity91 ' most fundamental thoughts -- their religious beliefs -- and doubting the genuineness of their forced conversion , to eliminate them			0
as human rights activists , we feel despair at the extraordinary savagery of @entity117 -- not just against executed journalist @entity118 , but against hundreds of thousands of @entity119 , ethnic and religious minorities , and other @entity35 and @entity36 civilians			1
we are humbled by the challenge of restoring humanity to the conflicts that roil so much of the @entity125			1
we recognize that our work , whether it be laying the groundwork for future indictments or seeking secure and dignified asylum for the displaced , in the short term at least , will be limited			0
we realize that only political action at the highest levels has the capacity to prevent mass killings			1
precisely because of the extreme brutality and the deep political , cultural , and sectarian polarization , the universal values of human rights have never been so important			1
and even if the perpetrators are beyond shaming , the moral imperative to name names has never been greater .			0

@entity144 : human rights workers operate amid laws that keep wrongdoers accountable
