-- we 're counting on @entity2 to lead the way ! in a weekend that saw both the @entity7 thriller " @entity8 " and @entity11 's @entity10 re-release of " @entity12 " perform better than expected , it was the former that crossed the finish line in first place			1
the r - rated " @entity8 , " which stars @entity2 as a former smuggler trying to protect his brother - in - law from a drug lord , earned an estimated $ 24.1 million over the standard three - day weekend , and looks to finish the four - day holiday weekend with about $ 28 million			1
that 's a solid start for the $ 25 million movie , a remake of the 2008 @entity22 thriller " @entity23			1
" it also represents @entity2 's strongest solo debut since 2008 ′ s " @entity26			0
" ( what ? no ! ) " @entity8 " confirmed @entity2 's ability to open a movie , as 69 percent of @entity31 's participants listed the actor as their reason for buying a ticket			0
it received an overall " a- " from the tracking service 's graders , indicating positive word of mouth			0
but the movie will have to contend with a number of action films in the coming weeks , including " @entity41 , " " @entity42 : awakening , " and " @entity44			0
" in second was " @entity12 " with $ 18.5 million for the three - day frame -- the largest january opening for an animated film ( topping 2006 ′ s " @entity48 " )			1
@entity11 spent less than $ 10 million converting the 1991 classic to @entity10 , so this kind of opening more than justifies the studio 's decision to re-release the musical			1
it also bodes well for @entity11 's @entity55 re-releases : " @entity56 " in september , and " @entity57 " and " @entity58 " in 2013			0
" @entity59 " should finish the four - day weekend with around $ 25 million			1
however , despite " @entity59 's " commendable performance , it 's worth pointing out that it fell short of last september 's " @entity63 , " which debuted to $ 30.2 million			1
that could be the result of several factors			0
for one , " @entity69 " was a much bigger hit in its original release , earning $ 312.9 million versus " @entity59 's " $ 145.9 million			2
second , " @entity59 " has been out on @entity10 blu - ray since october , whereas " @entity69 " did n't come out on blu - ray until after it returned to theaters			2
and " @entity59 " had a harder time attracting the interest of boys			0
according to @entity11 , just 31 percent of " @entity78 's " audience was male -- compared to 44 percent for " @entity63			0
" the weekend 's third new release , the gospel - singing dramedy " @entity80 , " drew a smaller congregation with $ 11.3 million over the three - day frame			1
the $ 25 million movie , starring @entity86 and @entity87 , is on pace for $ 14 million by monday night			2
those who saw the film loved it , though , as @entity31 moviegoers handed the picture an " a- " rating			0
according to the tracking service , 73 percent of the audience was female , and 78 percent was at least 25 years old			0
a rep for @entity99 said the film performed particularly well throughout the @entity101 and @entity102			0
among holdovers , " mission : impossible -- @entity106 " dropped a mild 42 percent for $ 11.5 million			2
on saturday it surpassed the original " mission : @entity109 's " $ 181 million gross to become the action franchise 's second - highest grossing film , behind " mission : @entity109 " with $ 215.4 million			1
" @entity114 : a game of shadows " continued to hold up well , too , slipping just 39 percent for $ 8.4 million , and pushing its cumulative total to $ 170 million			2
one film that did not hang on well was last week 's winner , " @entity121			0
" the r - rated horror flick plummeted 77 percent for $ 7.9 million			1
that 's the largest second - weekend drop for a wide release since 2009 ′ s " @entity125 : the @entity126 " -- now there 's a double feature for you ! it 's also the third - worst decline on record for a film playing in at least 2,000 theaters , behind 2003 ′ s " @entity134 " and 2009 ′ s " friday the 13th			2
" but do n't feel too bad for " @entity121 , " as it has already consumed $ 46.2 million on a $ 1 million budget			2
" @entity139 , " starring @entity140 as former @entity142 prime minister @entity141 , expanded from five to 802 theaters and earned a respectable $ 5.4 million , which was just enough for 10th place			1
