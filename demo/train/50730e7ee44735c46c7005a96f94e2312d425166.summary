-- @entity1 owns stacks of classic comic books , baseball cards that include a young @entity5 and @entity6 and other collectibles she wants to sell			2
but she ca n't do so on @entity8 , she says			1
according to @entity1 , the popular auction site ca n't confirm her as a seller because she 's deaf			1
" @entity8 keeps me from taking advantage of opportunities that other people have and it 's because i could n't hear , " @entity1 , of @entity11 , @entity12 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity13			1
" somebody has to have the courage to stand up and say ' this is not right			0
' " at issue , according to @entity1 , is the way the auction site verifies sellers			1
@entity8 says it offered @entity1 alternative ways of verifying her identity			2
but the dispute casts a light on a bigger question that some experts say may need to go all the way to the @entity31 : just how responsive must the @entity32 be to the @entity33 ? the @entity32 has long been seen as an equalizer , granting everyone the same access to information regardless of cultural background or economic status			0
but for some users with disabilities , it 's not so simple			1
" the @entity33 was signed in 1990			0
the @entity32 did n't really start going until the 1990s , " said @entity43 , a @entity45 , @entity44 , attorney who specializes in cases involving the federal law			2
" this is a topic we 're going to have to be watching			0
this is not going away			0
" in @entity1 's case , she says she ca n't use @entity8 's verification system , which requires sellers to retrieve and submit a password from a telephone call			1
she ca n't hear the password and says @entity8 does n't use voice - to - text or other technologies deaf people often rely upon			1
" they said , can your mom or dad answer the phone for you , " said @entity1 , who lip - reads and speaks with the assistance of a hearing aid			2
" and i said , i 'm a 47 - year - old adult woman			2
no. i do n't live at home			2
no. " a federal judge did n't agree with her argument , though			1
@entity72 district judge @entity71 dismissed her complaint after finding it lacked enough facts			2
specifically , he said @entity1 did n't prove that she tried to register as a seller after talking to @entity8 about a possible solution			1
" @entity8 is pleased with the court 's decision to dismiss the case , " company spokeswoman @entity78 said in a written statement			1
" @entity8 strives to provide all users with the best customer experiences possible , including those with special access needs			1
@entity8 will continue to stand ready to assist those who are deaf or hard of hearing become @entity8 sellers			1
" @entity1 is appealing that ruling			2
little legal agreement @entity8 is the most high - profile website to be involved in a disabilities discrimination case since @entity94 , which last year agreed to caption all of its online movies and other shows by 2014			1
the move , which the @entity99 called " a model for the streaming video industry , " came after @entity102 was hit with a 2010 class - action suit because not all of its films were subtitled			0
a federal judge in @entity107 ruled in the plaintiffs ' favor , saying any new laws regarding the @entity32 should " complement , not supplant " the @entity33			1
" the @entity119 , " which handled the case , " hopes that this is the beginning of opening the internet for deaf and hard - of - hearing individuals in streamed entertainment , education , government benefits , and more , " the group said at the time			2
arguments for both sides in those and other cases point out something of a problem : there seems to be no agreement on how disability issues on the @entity130 should be handled			0
@entity43 , the disability law attorney , said judges have ruled both ways in those cases , and that even those who agreed cited different laws in doing so			0
some have stuck close to the original wording of the @entity33 , which requires that places of business be physically accessible to people with disabilities			2
websites that represent brick - and - mortar stores need to comply , courts have ruled , while @entity130 - only businesses do not			0
other courts have opined that @entity33 regulations should obviously be extended to web companies , since the widespread popularity of web commerce did n't exist when the law was written			2
it all makes for a confusing jumble of opinions that legal experts say needs to be clarified			0
@entity155 has n't been much help , either			0
even when they made some changes to the original @entity33 language in 2008 , they failed to address online concerns			0
to the @entity31 ? that , @entity43 says , means the @entity31 will ultimately need to settle the issue once and for all			0
" this is going to go all the way to the top , " he said			0
" there are so many different approaches			0
you 're going to see the courts split			0
unless @entity155 steps in and talks about how the @entity33 applies to the @entity32 , the court 's going to have to figure it out			0
" @entity174 , a professor of law at @entity175 and director of the school 's @entity177 , thinks current law is somewhat more settled			0
the argument that won the day for @entity8 -- that the @entity33 does n't specifically mention websites and , therefore , does n't apply to them -- has prevailed except for in " quirky rulings , " he says			1
" we might debate the merits of those laws , many of which were written for a different time , but that 's for the legislatures to do , not the courts , " he said			0
" as a result , the lawsuits against websites for discriminating against the disabled are not legally meritorious			0
in this case , the courts bent over backwards -- more than they should have , in my opinion -- to give ms. @entity1 a chance to make a valid legal complaint			0
" that said , @entity202 thinks websites should voluntarily be doing more			0
" in this case , for example , it seems reasonable that @entity8 should have a workaround to their authentication system that works for the hearing - impaired , " he said			1
" they may have a workaround -- the materials i 've read in this case have n't been clear about that -- but the workaround should be easy enough that ms. @entity1 never needed to go to court			2
" some websites may not have the resources to provide full accommodations for the disabled , but a site like @entity8 does -- and it should do so , " he added			1
@entity8 notes that in her complaint , @entity1 said company agents told her about alternative methods , including submitting proof of identity and @entity229 text messages , that she and other hearing - impaired people could use to become sellers			1
" @entity8 offers solutions to help the visually and hearing impaired , individuals with color vision deficiencies , as well as those with limited dexterity access @entity8 's services , " said @entity78 , the @entity8 spokeswoman			1
on its website , @entity8 has a page devoted to accessibility issues , including a profie of @entity243 , a pastor who became a successful seller despite a degenerative eye disease			1
for her part , @entity1 says she 's willing to go all the way to the @entity31 if that 's what it takes for her to use the auction site as a seller just as easily as she 's used it as a shopper			1
" you know what 's funny -- @entity8 loved me as a buyer , " she said			1
" oh , sure ... because they made money off of me			0

@entity259 woman : @entity8 wo n't let me sell items because i 'm deaf
auction site 's verification system requires sellers to retrieve a phone password
a federal judge has thrown out the case ; woman says she 's appealing
