-- a weekend of back - and - forth between two governors , the federal government and a nurse about mandatory quarantines left more questions than answers			1
at the heart of the debate : would such quarantines on health workers who just came back from treating @entity13 patients in @entity14 help prevent the spread of the virus , or would they discourage medical aid workers from helping fight the global crisis ? here 's what we know about the latest ebola policies : who enacted tougher rules for health workers ? @entity26 , @entity24 and @entity25 say anyone returning from having direct contact with @entity13 patients in @entity14 will have to be quarantined for 21 days			1
the 21 - day period marks the maximum incubation period for @entity13			2
illinois gov. @entity33 's office said the quarantine would be a " home quarantine			1
" " this protective measure is too important to be voluntary , " @entity33 said			2
when @entity24 gov. @entity38 and @entity26 gov. @entity39 announced their new policies on friday , they called for hospitalization or quarantine			1
but on sunday night , after debate over the policies heated up , the governors said the quarantines could be carried out at home			1
@entity39 , @entity38 clarify policy on ebola health worker quarantines would home quarantines even work ? depends on which side you ask			1
neither @entity38 nor @entity39 explained how a home quarantine would work if family members were also in the home			2
it 's also unclear how a home quarantine would or could be enforced if the quarantined person chose to leave the house			1
on the other hand , the governors say something had to be done ; that asking returning medical workers to voluntarily quarantine themselves has n't worked			1
public health experts say there 's plenty of scientific evidence indicating there 's very little chance that a random people will get @entity13 , unless they are in very close contact -- close enough to touch bodily fluids -- with someone who has it			2
still , there 's also a sense that authorities have to do something because of @entity81 ' fears -- rational or not -- and the belief that the country is better off safe than sorry			2
as @entity87 , an infectious disease epidemiologist at the @entity89 , says , " you want to try to eliminate not just real risk , but perceived risk			0
" what led up to the policies ? not long after she returned home from covering @entity13 in @entity95 , @entity93 medical correspondent dr. @entity92 violated her voluntary quarantine in @entity24 to pick up takeout from a restaurant in october -- even after her colleague became infected			1
in @entity26 , city workers scrambled to retrace the steps of dr. @entity102 , who tested positive last week			1
he 'd been on the subway and to a bowling alley , among other places			0
what are the concerns about such quarantines ? the concerns are twofold : one , it could deter doctors and nurses from traveling to @entity14 to help rid @entity13 ; and two , it could greatly impede the livelihoods of health care workers			1
" if i lose three weeks on my return and do n't get to do the work i 'm supposed to do ... means this would n't be workable for me , " said dr. @entity115 , a pediatric immunologist at @entity116			2
the director of the @entity121 expressed a similar view earlier this month , arguing that stringent travel restrictions might create more problems than they solve			0
" it makes it hard to get health workers in , because they ca n't get out , " dr. @entity125 said			1
" if we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in @entity14 , it will spread not only in those three countries ( in @entity14 hit hardest by @entity13 ) , but to other parts of @entity14 and ultimately increase the risk here " in the @entity81			1
who would pay for the time off ? @entity39 added that if employers do n't pay quarantined workers for the time they are absent while under quarantine , " the government will			1
" how has this affected health care workers ? the same day the governors announced their tougher policies friday , nurse @entity146 arrived at @entity149 after spending a month helping treat @entity13 patients in @entity151			1
she did n't have any symptoms and tested negative for @entity13			0
nonetheless , the nurse from @entity155 , @entity156 , was holed up inside a quarantine tent at @entity158 in @entity149 over the weekend			2
she was released from the hospital monday , according to her attorney , and will return to @entity156			1
" this is an extreme that is really unacceptable , and i feel like my basic human rights have been violated , " @entity146 told @entity0 's @entity161 on " @entity162 " on sunday			0
she slammed @entity38 for describing her as " obviously ill. " " first of all , i do n't think he 's a doctor			0
secondly , he 's never laid eyes on me			0
and thirdly , i 've been asymptomatic since i 've been here , " @entity146 said			0
is @entity146 's quarantine unconstitutional ? attorney @entity169 said there 's a " legal basis " to challenge the quarantine policies in @entity24 and in @entity26 , but the nurse is n't sure she wants to do so			1
@entity38 said he was glad that @entity146 had been released and defended his actions			2
" the reason she was put in the hospital in the first place was because she was running a high fever and was symptomatic			2
if you live in @entity24 , you 're quarantined in your home			1
" that 's always been the policy			0
if you live outside the state , and you 're symptomatic , we 're not letting you go onto public transportation			0
it makes no common sense			0
the minute she was no longer symptomatic , she was released , " the governor said			2
@entity146 said she has nothing to recover from			0
her temperature is normal , and she feels fine			0
who else might amp up @entity13 rules ? @entity194 is starting mandatory monitoring for all travelers returning from @entity14 , and @entity197 is following suit			1
" @entity197 will implement an active monitoring program on monday for all returning passengers from @entity202 , @entity95 and @entity151 , with a special emphasis on returning health care workers , " said @entity197 governor spokesman @entity199			1
@entity39 says he knows some people probably think he 's overreacting			0
" we 're staying one step ahead , " the governor said			0
" some people will say we are being too cautious			0
i 'll take that criticism because that 's better than the alternative			0
" is n't there a middle ground ? there is			0
one possibility is to have those travelers go through more than just temperature checks			0
dr. @entity220 , director of @entity222 's @entity221 , says one such measure could be checking daily for decreases in white blood cell counts or platelets -- which could be , but are n't necessarily , a sign of an @entity13 infection			0
and @entity87 thinks there should be stricter controls on what a person who arrives from @entity14 does in his or her first three weeks in the @entity81			1
for instance , he thinks such a person should n't take public transportation or go to crowded places like bowling alleys -- both of which officials say @entity102 did before he was symptomatic			0
@entity0 's @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 contributed to this report .			0

new : a nurse who was quarantined at a hospital in @entity24 is released
