no , it 's not the title of a wacky b movie , featuring primates amongst the stars in a bid for intergalactic dominance			0
rather , @entity10 says this plot represents its latest bid to join the space race , though @entity10 's foes fear the real aim may be to test missile launching capabilities for less peaceful purposes			1
according to official @entity10 news reports , the primate was strapped snugly into a @entity22 ( or @entity23 ) rocket and launched 120 kilometers ( 75 miles ) into the sky on monday			1
he returned back to @entity26 sometime later , looking shell - shocked but alive as a crowd of men along the desert ground rejoiced , video from state - run @entity32 showed			0
" sending ( the monkey into space ) and retrieving it was the first step for sending humans into space , " defense minister @entity34 said , according to the semi-official @entity35			1
but while it was celebrated in @entity42 , the monkey business -- if it actually happened -- did n't play well in @entity44			0
@entity46 spokeswoman @entity45 told reporters monday that while she saw pictures of " the poor little monkey , " the @entity53 does n't " have any way to confirm this ( happened ) , one way or another			2
" " but our concerns with @entity10 's development of space launch vehicle technologies are obviously well - known : any space launch vehicle capable of placing an object in orbit is directly relevant to the development of long - range ballistic missiles , " she told reporters			1
@entity45 said that , if confirmed , @entity10 's launch would violate a @entity65 resolution that forbids " any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons			1
" but the tone was far different in @entity10 , where officials characterized the monkey 's reportedly successful trip high into the sky and back as a major step forward in its space program			1
one of the 24 founding members of the @entity77 in 1959 , @entity10 sent its first satellite into space in 2009			2
other launches have followed , including of an orbiter capable of transmitting images of , and to , @entity26			0
monday 's reported launch of the monkey -- who was kept in a " completely sealed " capsule that produces oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide , with his vital signs recorded throughout the flight -- is part of a larger effort to someday send humans into space , said @entity96 director @entity95			1
it 's not the first time animals have reached the skies ahead of humans			2
the @entity53 space program launched a rhesus monkey into space from @entity103 in 1948			2
other primates and mice followed , and the @entity106 a few years later joining the animal space race when nine dogs went skyward aboard rockets			0
many more creatures soared into space in the years to come , until @entity106 cosmonaut @entity111 orbited @entity26 in april 1961			0
@entity53 astronaut @entity112 made a suborbital flight later that year , and @entity114 became the first @entity53 to orbit earth in 1962			0

@entity10 state news reports a monkey strapped *inside* a capsule launches into space
