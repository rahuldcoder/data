-- @entity1 recalls how @entity2 came to call their new album " @entity5			1
" " @entity6 came in one day and he said , ' i 've got this title for a song that i think you 're really going to like			1
it 's we 're ' @entity5			1
' and i was like , ' ooh yeah , i do love that title			2
actually , i think that would make a great title for the record ! ' " " @entity5 " would also become a mission statement for the post-grunge quartet 's first cd in seven years			1
" i think we 've come to the realization that it 's ok to be a bit odd , " said @entity19			1
" it 's ok not to fit in , and actually , it 's ok if you 're not cool			1
" @entity19 was 28 when she burst out of the @entity28 , @entity29 , music scene in 1995 with guitarist @entity30 , bassist @entity31 and drummer @entity32			2
as the man who produced the @entity51 ' " @entity50 " and @entity34 's " nevermind , " @entity32 may have had the name , but it was @entity19 who became the face of garbage : a flame - haired @entity41 vixen who prowled the stage in boots and a minidress , taking " @entity49 " to task and pouting that she 's " @entity48			1
" the group 's subversive wit and sonic collision of pop , alternative rock and electronica placed them squarely outside the mainstream , yet it was the mainstream that embraced them			1
over the course of four cds , they sold 13 million albums worldwide			1
but there have been tensions , too			2
in 2003 , the band took a break			0
the next year , they re-grouped and released another record , only to call it quits in the midst of their " @entity74 " world tour of 2005			0
" it was n't the touring that we really had a problem with			0
it 's just unfortunately all the issues that we had culminated whilst we were touring , " @entity19 recalled			1
she blamed many of those problems on their old record company			0
" we were an indie band signed to an indie label , and then we got sold as a commodity to a major label that had very little interest in us , and it was a miserable experience for us			2
" " @entity5 " was released may 15 on the group 's own label , @entity92			1
" free at last ! " @entity19 exclaimed			0
" we are signing the checks on absolutely everything , which is terrifying , but i think nothing ventured in life that does n't require a little risk is not worth taking			0
i think this time around , what is different is that we 're not tied to making ridiculous amounts of profit			0
that 's just not what we 're interested in , and it 's certainly not why we joined a band in the first place			2
" @entity19 is now 45			0
with her signature red hair and creamy complexion , she 's as appealing as she was in the mid- ' 90s			2
the new record picks up where @entity2 left off seven years ago , not veering too far from their meticulously crafted layers of goth - tinged pop - rock			1
this is a band that knows it sounds different from everyone else , and does n't care to conform			0
" we took some time off			0
we just felt a little burnt out , if truth be told			0
and then i guess we just had enough life happen that we felt ready to create again , " she said			0
" i called the band up and said , ' are you into this ? ' and they said , ' yup ! we 're in			0

" @entity5 " is @entity2 's first album in seven years
" i think we 've come to the realization that it 's ok to be a bit odd , " says @entity1
over the course of four cds , the group sold 13 million albums worldwide
