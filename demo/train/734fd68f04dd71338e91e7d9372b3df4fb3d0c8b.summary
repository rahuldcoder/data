@entity0 -- even for someone who has written more than 2,000 columns over the last 20 years , sometimes the words come out wrong			1
all i know is that my wife is angry			1
" you need to fix this ! " she says , as she holds up her smartphone			1
on the screen is a copy of my latest column for @entity1 scolding a faction of the @entity14 , the undocumented youth angling for legal status , for what i -- and judging from the response , quite a few other @entity17 -- see as a sense of entitlement			1
" i hated this column , " she said			1
" i know what you were trying to say , because i know you			2
but other people wo n't understand it			1
they 're confused and angry , and they should be			2
you 're saying that these kids have become entitled and self - important like other kids and they 're going to blow it for everyone else -- including their undocumented parents			1
but that 's not what you walk away from this column with			1
what you walk way with is meanness			2
and that 's not you			2
sometimes , it is me			2
as i often tell audiences that gather for my speeches , constantly cheerful and positive writers work for @entity44			2
and yet , i notice that many of my critics on the left who think the tone of the @entity14 piece was harsh did n't object when , in the past , i lashed out in a similar tone against those on the right			1
when voters turned out @entity56 sen. @entity55 , the major sponsor of that state 's dreadful immigration law , i wrote that " evil has left the building			2
" when @entity62 was overheard telling donors that he 'd have a better shot at winning the presidential election if he were @entity66 , i mocked the @entity68 candidate for " playing the victim " because he had the " misfortune to be born a white male			2
" in another column , after @entity62 blamed his defeat on minorities who were hungry for giveaways , i called him a " loser			1
" and , when writing about the intersection of immigration and politics , i have had no trouble saying that the @entity68 brand is toxic to @entity82 because the party has chosen to " pander to racists and nativists			2
" every time , conservatives were upset , but -- on @entity88 and other social media -- liberals applauded			2
could it be that what really troubles people is n't the tone of a particular column but who is being skewered ? still , as a @entity97 immigrant herself , my wife has a point			1
and so do many of my critics			2
in the offending column , i was not trying to describe the individual lives of the estimated 1.4 million undocumented high school and college students in the @entity17			1
i was talking about a movement , a political strategy that involves @entity14 demanding what they see as their " rights " and , in the process , succumbing to a radicalism that is counterproductive and threatens to torpedo immigration reform for millions of others			1
like the saying goes , you catch more flies with honey than ... by donning a cap and gown and occupying the office of a member of @entity122 until you 're arrested			0
but people did n't hear that message			1
they drew upon their own frame of reference and , thinking back to @entity14 they know , declared that they were swell folks who were humble and idealistic and did n't feel entitled			1
so , they said , i must be wrong			0
ironically , some of those who reacted angrily to the column wound up making its point			1
one reader , who identified himself as a @entity14 who has lived in the @entity17 for 11 years , insisted that he and his cohort were n't making demands			1
then he added : " speaking for myself ... at this point i am done asking			0
i demand to be fully incorporated into this society			0
" now there 's a lack of self - awareness			0
yet , that 's also a good trait for columnists , who can always say things better and clearer			0
so let 's try this again			0
for those undocumented youth who think that @entity17 owes them a fulfillment of their dreams , or who -- like the reader -- demand to be fully " incorporated into this society , " that first column was for you			1
but for the rest of you who work hard and obey the law and keep your head down and just want to find a way to live legally in a country you consider your own and where you 've lived most of your life , let me first apologize for lumping you together with the demanders			0
then let me give you some friendly advice : -- think critically			0
it 's not enough to have beliefs			0
you have to constantly challenge yourselves so you know why you believe it , and can defend it			0
because someday , you 'll have to do so ; -- privileges are not rights , and so they are earned and not granted by our creator			0
if @entity122 gives you the privilege of legal status , you need to decide what you 're prepared to give in return			0
you need a plan , and a demand is not a plan ; -- focus on deeds not words , and admit that neither political party has been courageous or honest on immigration			0
so do n't feel beholden to either			1
power comes from exercising options			0
shop around ; ( last week , the @entity197 administration released figures showing that @entity199 broke its own record for total number of deportations			0
the agency removed 409,849 illegal immigrants in the 2012 fiscal year , compared to 396,906 in the 2011 fiscal year and 392,000 in the 2010 fiscal year			0
as most @entity14 would agree , those numbers are nothing to be proud of , especially since they appear to be driven by politics			1
) -- challenge your friends with the same amount of enthusiasm that you challenge your foes			0
after all , in the world of politics and beyond , those you support owe you something for standing by them			0
make sure you collect ; and -- accept that , while it 's true that you did nothing wrong when you were brought here as a child , someone along the line , someone in your family tree broke a law			0
they crossed a border without permission , or overstayed a visa			0
before we can legalize your status , you have to accept the wrong that was done and someone has to make amends for it -- if not you , then the person who broke the rules			0
above all , always try to be better people who strive for fairness , listen to different points of view , and take responsibility for your words and deeds			1
and i 'll do the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			1
