although my work has been in @entity4 , my home and heart have always been along the beautiful coastline of the @entity6 in @entity7			1
it 's a place where i first developed my dedication to public service			0
and it inspired what would become a lifelong effort to promote responsible stewardship of our oceans			1
healthy oceans benefit all @entity17 , whether they live on our nation 's coasts or in the heartland			1
that 's why i eagerly agreed in the mid- 2000s to help lead the @entity23 , a special effort to bring together leading voices from around the @entity17 to examine the health of our oceans through the lens of science , not partisan politics			1
ten years ago , the commission released its findings , the nation 's first comprehensive report on the state of @entity17 's marine environment in more than 40 years			1
because of leadership from both sides of the aisle in @entity41 and from @entity43 and @entity44 administrations alike , we 've made remarkable progress over the past decade since the release of that report to address many of the problems it identified			0
but , there 's still much work to be done			0
our oceans are a tremendous economic engine , providing jobs for millions of @entity17 , directly and indirectly , and a source of food and recreation for countless more			1
yet , for much of @entity17 history , the health of @entity17 's oceans has been taken for granted , assuming its bounty was limitless and capacity to absorb waste without end			2
this is far from the truth			0
the situation the commission found in 2001 was grim			2
many of our nation 's commercial fisheries were being depleted and fishing families and communities were hurting			1
more than 60 % of our coastal rivers and bays were degraded by nutrient runoff from farmland , cities and suburbs			1
government policies and practices , a patchwork of inadequate laws and regulations at various levels , in many cases made matters worse			0
our nation needed a wake - up call			0
the situation , on many fronts , is dramatically different today because of a combination of leadership initiatives from the @entity93 and old - fashioned bipartisan cooperation on @entity95			0
perhaps the most dramatic example can be seen in the effort to end overfishing in @entity17 waters			1
in 2005 , president @entity100 worked with congressional leaders to strengthen @entity17 's primary fisheries management law , the @entity103			1
this included establishment of science - based catch limits to guide decisions in rebuilding depleted species			2
these reforms enacted by @entity41 are paying off			0
in fact , an important milestone was reached last june when the @entity112 announced it had established annual , science - based catch limits for all @entity17 ocean fish populations			0
we now have some of the best managed fisheries in the world			2
progress also is evident in improved overall ocean governance and better safeguards for ecologically sensitive marine areas			2
in 2010 , president @entity122 issued a historic executive order establishing a national ocean policy directing federal agencies to coordinate efforts to protect and restore the health of marine ecosystems			0
president @entity100 set aside new @entity17 marine sanctuary areas from 2006 through 2009			0
today , the @entity130 , one of several marine monuments created by the @entity100 administration , provides protection for some of the most biologically diverse waters in the @entity137			2
despite the strides made in the 10 years since the @entity140 issued its report , challenges remain			1
coastal development continues , largely unchecked , and wetlands and marshes continue to shrink			1
that exposes more than half of the @entity17 who live along the coasts to the physical and economic damage caused by increasingly high - intensity storms such as @entity151 and @entity152			0
on top of that , major challenges that the commission could not see as clearly in 2003 , including ocean acidification and rising ocean temperatures , further threaten some of our most valuable fisheries			2
the @entity17 must pursue a broader , ecosystem - based approach to build resilience in our oceans and respond to future threats			0
over my many years in public service , i 've seen many commissions come and go			0
but i 'm perhaps most proud of the work the @entity23 did to warn about the threat posed to our oceans and call for change			1
every time i take my grandchildren to play on the beaches of @entity177 , my resolve to keep the issue of responsible ocean stewardship forefront on the agenda of policymakers in @entity4 becomes even stronger .			1

@entity184 has worked in @entity4 , but his *beloved* @entity7 coastline is home
@entity23 10 years ago found depleted fisheries , *polluted* rivers and bays
@entity184 : stewardship of oceans has improved , especially in control of overfishing
still ahead : curbing development , guarding wetlands , dealing with warmer waters
