@entity0 , @entity1 -- in all likelihood , the 91 @entity1 health workers heading to @entity4 on tuesday will face the most perilous assignment of their careers			1
they are joining 165 of their colleagues already working in the region to halt the spread of @entity11			0
although @entity1 government officials say the majority of the health workers being sent to @entity4 are veterans of previous tough postings , the risks that @entity11 presents are unique			1
" this is the biggest challenge i have ever faced in my life , it 's a very dangerous disease , " said dr. @entity19 , a @entity1 who completed previous assignments in @entity21 and @entity22			2
@entity19 said he will soon be sent to treat people suffering from @entity11 in either @entity27 or @entity28			0
" my family , they are a bit worried but they know i will be taking care of everything			0
they will trust in my daily habits and routines in order to avoid the disease , " @entity19 said			0
@entity19 spoke to @entity2 as he trained at the @entity40 in @entity0 , where health workers are drilled by instructors provided by the @entity43 on how to put on and take off seven different layers of clothing that provide protection from the epidemic			2
" the important thing is to save lives , " said dr. @entity48 , the institute 's director			0
" why are @entity1 going to @entity4 ? to save lives			2
" @entity1 medical diplomacy is as old as the revolution that first brought the @entity55 to power , but its motivation is not purely altruistic			1
sending health workers abroad boosts the image of a country whose human rights record is criticized			2
and in some cases , as with a program that sent thousands of @entity1 doctors to @entity22 , the island gets paid back in trade , such as oil			0
@entity1 's @entity11 efforts have already raised discussion about how it compares to what the @entity71 is providing			1
" while the @entity71 and several other wealthy countries have been happy to pledge funds , only @entity1 and a few nongovernmental organizations are offering what is most needed : medical professionals in the field , " the @entity73 opined in an editorial			1
" it is a shame that @entity82 , the chief donor in the fight against @entity11 , is diplomatically estranged from @entity0 , the boldest contributor			2
in this case the schism has life - or - death consequences , because @entity90 and @entity1 officials are not equipped to coordinate global efforts at a high level , " the editorial continues			0
@entity1 's health care system was degraded by the collapse of the @entity95 in the early ' 90s			2
in recent years , the government has sent health workers to @entity22 and @entity98 , in exchange for badly needed hard currency and oil			1
those programs make up one of the largest sources of income for the island			0
still , the island continues to post health care workers to other developing nations and even before the @entity11 crisis began , had over 4,000 doctors , nurses and technicians stationed in @entity4			1
" our principle has been to share what we have and not to give what we do n't , " @entity114 said			0
the @entity1 health workers will work in @entity4 for at least six months			1
if they themselves become infected , they have agreed not to be repatriated to @entity1 for treatment , to avoid spreading the illness further			0
on monday , at an emergency summit in @entity0 of representatives from 12 @entity90 and @entity127 countries , @entity1 president @entity123 said the danger presented by @entity11 transcends borders and politics			2
" we should try to avoid the politicization of this grave problem , which distracts us from the fundamental objective : helping to stop the epidemic in @entity4 and stop it from spreading to other regions , " he said			0
in a rare conciliatory gesture to the @entity71 government , which @entity1 officials typically deride as an imperialist power intent on wrecking the island 's economy , @entity123 said the fight against @entity11 should unite the two governments			1
" @entity1 is willing to work elbow - to - elbow with all countries , " @entity123 said			0
" including the @entity71 " former @entity1 leader @entity147 also penned an editorial in the state - run newspaper this week , offering to " gladly cooperate with @entity90 personnel on this task " of fighting @entity11			1
in a similar gesture in 2005 , @entity1 offered to send a team of doctors to aid in the aftermath of @entity158			1
the @entity71 government ignored the request			0
possibly signaling that it recognized the boost @entity1 gains from medical diplomacy , the @entity71 government in 2006 announced a program to entice @entity1 doctors to defect			1
the @entity166 allows @entity1 health professional working in a third country at the behest of the @entity1 government to defect to the @entity71			1
while so far not accepting the @entity1 offer to cooperate in the fight against @entity11 , @entity71 officials have also praised the @entity175 government 's efforts to stop the epidemic			1
" already we are seeing nations large and small stepping up in impressive ways to make a contribution on the frontlines			0
@entity1 , a country of just 11 million people , has sent 165 health professionals and it plans to send nearly 300 more , " @entity71 secretary of state @entity181 said on friday			1
the @entity71 has pledged some 4,000 military personnel to assist with the fight against the disease in @entity4 , although the troops are not expected to treat people suffering from @entity11			1
while help continues to pour in from around the world to @entity4 countries reeling from the epidemic , the most basic need is doctors and nurses who can treat @entity11 patients without falling ill themselves , health officials said			2
" there is a lack of human resources , so it has been a major contribution , " said dr. @entity198 , the @entity43 's representative in @entity0 , who is coordinating the training of the @entity1 health workers			1
" you have to identify patients , diagnose patients and treat patients			0
if you do n't have the human resources to do that , you do n't have anything , " he said			0
" human resources in @entity4 is the major thing that 's lacking			0
" nurse @entity209 is one of the @entity1 health workers training to fight @entity11			1
he volunteered , he said , because if @entity11 is n't stopped in @entity4 , it will continue to spread to other countries			2
" if it could show up it in developed countries like the @entity71 and @entity215 , it can show up in undeveloped countries , too			0
our families are at risk as well , " he said .			0

nearly 100 *additional* @entity1 health workers heading to @entity4
@entity1 is one of the biggest contributors to the @entity11 fight there
medical diplomacy has long been a tool of the @entity1 government
@entity1 has even offered to cooperate with the @entity71
