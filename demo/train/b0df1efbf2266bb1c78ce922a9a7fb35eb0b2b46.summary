@entity0 was doomed even before he walked into the @entity1			1
the @entity3 veteran with deep relationships on @entity5 shocked @entity6 by appearing unprepared and inarticulate before his former colleagues during a @entity9 confirmation hearing to become defense secretary			1
he never really recovered and , nearly two years later , seemed increasingly out of step with an administration facing new national security challenges everywhere from the @entity14 to @entity15			0
@entity0 announced his intent to resign on monday			1
he was pushed out by president @entity18 , sources told @entity19 , but will stay in the job until a successor is named			1
his departure reflects @entity0 's inability to adapt to rapidly changing developments around the world or master the politics of @entity6			1
@entity0 joined the administration at a time when @entity18 insisted that the nation was moving beyond a decade of war only to find himself grappling with the threat from @entity32 , turmoil in @entity34 and aggressive moves from @entity36			1
in fact , there were signs that @entity0 was becoming increasingly critical in private of @entity18 's @entity42 strategy , which is constrained by the president 's insistence that @entity46 ground troops must not be dragged into a vicious civil war			1
" i have heard he has been a dead man walking for a while			0
he just did n't prove effective " said a former @entity1 official familiar with the personal dynamics of the @entity18 administration 's foreign policy team			1
some @entity0 defenders say he never really had a chance			1
" he came into an almost impossible situation , " said @entity56 , a former senior defense official now with the @entity57			0
" he had a confirmation hearing that really weakened him and he inherited a budget that was impacted by a sequester			1
" several former officials said @entity0 was undermined by an assumption that his @entity1 tenure would happen during a time of peace that would allow him to focus on streamlining the defense budget and ending combat in @entity71			1
" what you saw instead were rolling problems with @entity42 chemical weapons , the rise of @entity32 , and troops returning to @entity34 , " said another former administration official			0
meanwhile , the @entity79 reported over the weekend that @entity18 authorized a more expansive mission for the military in @entity71 in 2015			0
a third former senior administration official said that although @entity18 genuinely liked @entity0 , with whom he toured @entity34 and @entity71 before becoming president , an impression took hold in the @entity86 that the defense secretary had not mastered his job			1
" he was effective ( at ) dealing with management and budget issues , but not as a public face for policies and not as a forceful presence in internal policy debates , " the official said			0
former col. @entity96 , a @entity19 defense analyst , said @entity0 was " a loyal team player whose skill sets as a senator never fully translated into being secretary of defense			1
he added : " both sides came to that conclusion			0
" @entity18 and @entity0 put on a united front at a @entity86 resignation announcement on monday , with @entity18 pouring praise on his defense secretary , apparently to neuter speculation about a political split			1
a @entity1 spokesman insisted that @entity0 was n't fired			1
" both men agree that this is the right course of action , " rear admiral @entity110 told @entity111 on @entity19 's @entity112			0
" and the @entity116 said it clearly today , he not only supports it but he 's the one who initiated the conversation with the president			0
" but in @entity18 's orbit , it was accepted a long time ago that the choice of @entity0 -- based on his friendship with @entity18 , criticism of the iraq war surge and his standing as a former @entity129 senator -- never clicked			1
@entity0 also appears to have been the latest outsider who struggled to penetrate the national security clique around @entity18 , which , if anything , has further narrowed during the president 's second term			1
those closest to the president have embraced a foreign policy philosophy nourished by a belief in ending foreign wars , not starting new ones			0
national security intimates include adviser @entity144 , chief of staff @entity145 and deputy national security adviser @entity146			0
last month , it emerged that @entity0 wrote a blunt memo to @entity150 criticizing the administration 's approach to @entity42 as insufficient , warning , " we need to have a sharper view of what to do about the @entity158 regime , " a senior defense official told @entity19			1
he appeared to be tackling the paradoxes of @entity46 strategy in @entity42 , where @entity6 is fighting to eliminate @entity32 , a scenario which could benefit president @entity158 , to whom the administration is implacably opposed			0
@entity0 also found himself stuck in the middle of the tussle between the @entity86 and top generals , not just on @entity42 , but over post war @entity34 and @entity71 , with top brass pushing for a more direct @entity46 military role than the @entity86 envisions			1
in @entity6 's foreign policy community , there are also whispers that @entity18 forged a closer professional relationship with gen. @entity174 , chairman of the @entity175 , than @entity0			1
his experience contrasts with secretary of state @entity177 , who is also not a member of the @entity86 's inner circle			0
but he commandeered initiatives on @entity36 , the @entity14 and @entity181			0
and though @entity177 's success has been limited , there are n't any suggests that he 's lost the confidence of aides within his department or in the administration			0
@entity0 's appointment was partly intended to build on close relationships he maintained on @entity5 after leaving the @entity9 in 2009			1
but even those ties failed to help bolster @entity0			2
@entity129 sen. @entity191 repeatedly challenged @entity0 in the tense confirmation hearing over whether he still believed his 2007 statement that the @entity34 war surge was the " most dangerous foreign policy blunder " since the @entity3			1
before voting against his confirmation , @entity191 warned " nothing in @entity0 's background indicates that he would effectively manage the @entity1			1
" opinion : pushing out @entity0 not shake - up @entity18 needs ironically , now that he has quit , some of his prime antagonists have his back			2
@entity191 told news talk 550 radio in @entity206 monday that @entity0 was " up to the job " but was in his office last week and was " very frustrated			1
" he later suggested in a statement that @entity0 's departure was because of internal administration disagreements over @entity32 strategy			2
" i know @entity0 was frustrated with aspects of the administration 's national security policy and decision making process , " said @entity191			2
" his predecessors have spoken about the excessive micro-management they faced from the @entity86 and how that made it more difficult to do their jobs successfully			0
@entity191 added : " @entity0 's situation was no different			2
" @entity223 sen. @entity222 , a @entity224 , said his confidence in @entity0 had grown over the past year			2
" to his credit , he was really willing to consider a more robust response ( than the president ) and he started saying that @entity42 had become a direct threat to the homeland , " he said			0
@entity0 had also shown signs of being increasingly out of sync with @entity86 messaging			2
this summer , he called @entity32 an " imminent threat to every interest we have			0
" but the @entity86 insisted there was no sign that @entity32 could harm the homeland and that the point of @entity18 's decision to engage the radical @entity243 group was to ensure that it would not pose a danger in the future			0
@entity0 's comments also contrasted with @entity18 's aside to the @entity247 in january that current militant groups were like a junior varsity team compared to @entity250 - a quote widely seen as referring to @entity32			2
his departure may be one of several signs that the @entity86 has no intention of changing its approach to national security in @entity18 's final two years in the @entity86			0
in a recent episode , deputy national security advisor @entity258 was nominated for the number two job in the @entity261 , over @entity262 , who sources said @entity177 wanted for the job			2
while there have been whispers around @entity0 for months , the sudden nature of monday 's announcement sparked surprise on @entity5 , where speculation is already turning to his replacement			2
@entity222 said two of the most talked about candidates — @entity274 , the former under secretary of defense for policy , and @entity277 senator @entity276 , who served in the @entity279 's @entity278 — would both be " excellent			0
" @entity276 took his name out of consideration on monday			0
one former official suggested that sen. @entity283 , the retiring head of the @entity284 , would also be a safe pair of hands for @entity18 's last two years in office			0
meanwhile , there are questions about whether the management change at the @entity1 will reshape @entity46 policy toward @entity32 much as @entity293 's departure as defense secretary at a similar point during @entity297 's second term , opened the way for the @entity34 surge			2
" is this new pick going to double down on an insufficient response and a flawed strategy ? " @entity222 said in a telephone interview , " or will this new pick signal a willingness by @entity18 to accept a more robust response ? " " it 's an opportunity surrounded by danger , " @entity222 said			0
pushing out @entity0 not shake - up @entity18 needs			2

@entity0 never recovered from struggle at @entity9 confirmation hearing
he went to @entity1 to cut budgets but instead faced new wars
sources question whether he ever mastered job
