@entity0 is n't a country to which you just show up and wing it			1
for foreigners , the language barrier can be intense , the technology overwhelming and the prices terrifying for just about everything other than instant ramen			2
we 've taken care a lot of that for you with the tips below , leaving you to puzzle out the fun stuff , like getting out of a karaoke bar with your dignity intact and figuring out how to ask them to hold the katsuobushi at breakfast			1
rent a wireless router getting a prepaid sim card with local calling service is difficult in @entity0			1
it 's better to rent a handy little wireless router , known as " pocket @entity30 " in @entity31			1
this will allow multiple gadgets -- smartphone , laptop , tablet , @entity37 -- to connect at once with un-throttled , unlimited data			2
local calls are then possible via cheap internet phone services like @entity41			1
you can rent and return one of these devices easily at the telecom company counters at most airports			2
booking online before the trip brings the price down even lower			2
@entity50 , for example , offers a deal of ¥ 5,550 ( $ 53 ) for a seven - day rental plan if you book before the trip			1
they deliver the device to the airport / hotel / office for free the day before your arrival , and include a prepaid envelope for returns			1
book a @entity0 before arrival booking the flat - rate foreigner - only @entity0 , which can be used throughout the extensive @entity66 train network on all four main islands , can save a lot of money for travel by train			1
there are two types of @entity0			1
the @entity74 ( ¥ 38,880 or $ 374 for a seven - day pass ) is for " superior class " green cars on trains			1
the @entity79 ( ¥ 29,110 or $ 280 for a seven - day pass ) applies to economy class cars only			1
as green cars are less likely to be full , the @entity74 makes it easier for couples or groups to sit together ( or sit at all )			2
important : the pass must be booked outside of @entity0 before the trip			1
to procure one , visitors must do the following : buy an exchange order from @entity66 sales offices and agents in a foreign country ( see the list here )			0
make sure their passport is stamped with " @entity97 " when they enter @entity0			1
bring exchange order and stamped passport to a @entity101 with a @entity0 exchange office ( list of stations here )			1
buy a @entity107 card or a suica card for multiple trips on short - distance trains ( including the subway and metro area @entity66 trains ) , get a @entity107 card or a suica card that can be charged in bulk			2
these transportation cards save time otherwise spent buying individual tickets for each journey ( it can be difficult to figure out how to select your destination on ticket machines )			0
they 're especially handy when transferring trains , and are available for purchase at ticket vending machines in train stations , bus stations and subway stations			0
preloaded options range from ¥ 1,000 to ¥ 10,000 , with a deposit of ¥ 500 included in the price			0
while some trains do n't accept @entity107 and some wo n't accept @entity135 , most will accept both and the two are pretty much interchangeable			0
they can also be used to make purchases at stores and vending machines			0
download the @entity142 app cabs are extremely expensive in @entity0 -- the price is hiked up even higher at night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. -- so it 's good to have a firm handle on the public transport system			1
this easy - to - use @entity0 train app is a godsend to foreign travelers and is free for the first 30 days			1
upon entering train departure and arrival stations , the app displays ( in @entity152 ) the exact journey time , distance , fare and transfer stations , as well as which track your train is departing from			0
this includes long - distance shinkansen as well as subway trains			2
woe to those who are late by even a minute -- the schedule is incredibly accurate			0
take advantage of discount rates on domestic flights thanks to a fierce price war for domestic flights , @entity0 's major carriers offer discounts for foreign travelers for any air travel within @entity0			1
@entity176 's @entity175 allows international visitors to take up to five domestic flights for just ¥ 10,000 ( $ 96 ) each			0
@entity179 offers a @entity180 / visit @entity0 fare starting at ¥ 10,800 ( $ 103 )			1
tickets must be booked outside of @entity0 on the airlines ' global websites			1
if there 's a choice , fly into @entity186 , not @entity187 @entity186 is a lot more convenient for most travelers to fly into than @entity190 owing to the distance from @entity192 for both			0
it is not always an option			0
@entity196 for example only flies in and out of @entity187 while @entity198 serves both airports			0
a train ride from @entity186 to @entity201 takes approximately 28 minutes and costs around ¥ 580 ( $ 6 ) , while the train ride from @entity187 to @entity201 takes approximately 58 minutes and usually costs at least ¥ 2,600 ( $ 25 )			0
if you need to , there are easy train connections between the two airports , just factor in around an hour of travel time to be safe ( see the route map here )			2
@entity211 or @entity212 from @entity187 if you 're flying into @entity187 , the @entity211 ( @entity213 ) and @entity214 are competing services , both with their advantages			2
while ticket prices are usually higher than ordinary trains , @entity211 is currently running a deal on one - way trips from @entity187 into the city for ¥ 1,500 ( $ 14 ) , half the usual price			2
the deal is for trips to @entity225 station only , not @entity201 which is where @entity213 terminates and starts from ( @entity201 to @entity187 is ¥ 3,020 )			0
the @entity214 connects @entity187 with the @entity228 and @entity229 stations -- depending on your final destination , this can be a better and more timely connection that @entity201			0
tickets are ¥ 2,470 ( $ 24 ) while there is a special e-ticket discount ( ¥ 2,200 ) for foreign visitors , full details are here including the available trains for discount			0
download @entity240 app the extent of the language barrier may come as a surprise to first - timers to @entity0			1
we asked translators and a publisher of @entity152 study materials in @entity0 , and they agree that the @entity240 app is one of the handiest ways for translating what you want to say on the spot			1
it has a camera input option and is available offline for @entity259 2.3 and above , and is free to download			2
many of the translations are hardly perfect , but your hosts and others you meet will at least get the gist of what you 're trying to say			0
print out your hotel address in @entity268 this goes for travel to most foreign countries as well , but it 's a particularly useful tip in @entity0			1
just in case your phone battery runs out and you ca n't look up the address in a taxi , have a print - out to show the driver			2
know where to get cash it can be surprisingly difficult to find an atm that accepts foreign cards , even in @entity192			0
the atms that do can be found in @entity286 , post offices and @entity288			0
again , this sounds obvious , but you can save a lot of frustration by double checking before you arrive that your card is activated for withdrawals in a foreign country			0
know where to find refuge when in doubt , head to a konbini -- a @entity268 convenience store , including @entity286			0
they sell everything from phone chargers to underwear to concert tickets			0
the hot food selection is also extensive -- varying from fried chicken to udon to yakisoba sandwiches .			0

*practical* tips include *pre-booking* a wireless router and a @entity0
many of the foreigner - only discounts and services can only be reserved outside of @entity0
