-- @entity1 and @entity2 will face off again saturday			1
but this time it 's not the geopolitical arena where the action takes place -- but the glitzy stage of the @entity8			2
both countries have made it through the semi-finals to compete in the grand final in @entity13 , @entity14			2
the usual artistic rivalry has been given an added piquancy by the tensions between @entity1 and @entity2			1
@entity18 annexed @entity2 's @entity19 in march and eastern @entity2 is currently roiled by @entity21 separatist protests			1
the organizers describe @entity8 -- widely loved for its combination of over-the - top costumes , kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as a non-political event meant to unite @entity28 through song			2
but in reality , politics inevitably colors both the voting and the performances			0
this was demonstrated to an unusual degree on tuesday , when @entity1 's entrants -- 17 - year - old twins @entity38 and @entity40 -- were booed by the audience during their semi-final performance			1
@entity43 , a @entity8 expert and the editor - in - chief of @entity45 , the popular @entity8 website , told @entity0 that the contest is about national identity as well as music			2
" months of frustration over @entity1 's illegal annexation of @entity19 and @entity53 's anti-lgbt laws have left @entity28 angry , " @entity43 said			1
" the booing was a release , a statement of solidarity with @entity2 and @entity1 's sexual minorities			1
" it does n't help that @entity1 's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion			1
it goes , " ... living on the edge , closer to the crime , cross the line , one step at a time ... maybe there 's a day you 'll be mine			0
" @entity2 singer @entity71 , who is performing a song titled " @entity73 , " said tuesday that she was proud to be representing her country			1
" actually , my main position is that i 'm proud that i 'm @entity2 and everything i do here is for the @entity2 people , " the 21 - year - old said			2
" i 'm not standing alone on the stage , there are 46 million @entity2 behind me on the stage			2
" @entity83 will be the first to perform on saturday night , while @entity1 's @entity84 will be 15th out of 26 finalists to take the stage			1
after the singing comes the voting			0
former @entity89 nations have tended to award their votes to each other			0
whether the crisis in @entity2 changes that equation remains to be seen			0
the countries involved in the contest award a set of points from one to eight , then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs			0
they ca n't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both @entity103 and @entity104			0
television viewers can cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines , which count for half the final tally			0
the remainder of the vote is cast by national expert juries			0
the country with the highest points total wins -- and has the rather expensive honor of hosting the following year 's event			0
in 2013 , more than 180 million viewers in 45 countries tuned in to the action			0
