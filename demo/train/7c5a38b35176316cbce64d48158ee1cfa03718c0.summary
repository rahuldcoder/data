-- where there 's wind and water in @entity5 , you are likely to find " @entity6			1
" three brothers with a passion for windsurfing , and a love for their native south of @entity12			1
they train together at home , travel the world together for competitions , and they also party together			2
the siblings still live near each other in a port city known for , among other things , its @entity22 fish stew bouillabaisse and being the birthplace of soccer superstar @entity24			2
" at the beginning we were football players , " @entity25 says of his younger twin siblings @entity27 and @entity28			1
" from the age of 10 i started windsurfing and two years later my brothers followed me			1
now we do everything together			2
we still see each other pretty much every day			2
" several members of a family competing in the same professional sport are rare			2
the @entity38 from @entity39 were one such exception , with six of the older generation playing in the @entity42 -- which has also featured the four @entity44 brothers			2
@entity48 's @entity47 boys , meanwhile , each won the @entity49 while the three @entity50 were all @entity52 @entity51			2
the @entity53 are n't quite so high profile , but they are happy in their niche			0
their parents separated 25 years ago , but they were able to stay with their mom close to the beach			0
" it 's very nice because first of all for training , it 's very important for me and them because we can compare speed , " @entity25 , the oldest of the trio at 33 and most accomplished , told @entity0 's @entity62 series			1
" as well , when the motivation is n't really here for me or them , one goes sailing and you say , ' oh , i 'm not going to let him go alone for training			0
' we help each other a lot			0
" that also applies to looking for sponsors , and it 's apparent that a bit of banter between the siblings is never too far away			0
when @entity27 is asked what @entity25 would be if not a windsurfer , the 32 - year - old replies with a laugh , " nothing			1
" @entity25 , a world champion in 2008 in the speed discipline and known in his sport as " the @entity87 , " can still remember the day windsurfing caught his attention			1
he was nine and walking in @entity5 with his parents when he spotted people sailing , and decided he wanted to give it a try			1
not long after , he began to take lessons and his interest has never diminished			0
" you get the feeling to glide on the water and this is very special , " he says			2
" it 's what i like in the sport			0
" even now sometimes i go sailing and i say , ' it 's not my job			0
it 's just what i like to do			0
' " the only negative , he says , is lugging around all the heavy equipment -- @entity25 routinely tests gear in the off - season for the development of his own brand , and owns 15 boards and 20 sails			1
" when we travel , three of us , it 's like almost one ton , so it 's really hard , " he says , laughing			0
having won the world speed title , @entity25 finished third in the slalom rankings in 2010 and fourth last year , and is fifth so far in 2013 -- all the while trying to live up to his slogans of " do the best " and " be a machine			1
" @entity12 is a country excelling in slalom , with @entity123 a multiple world champion and holding top spot in the rankings currently			1
@entity27 and @entity28 have yet to match their brother , lying 20th and 27th in the slalom rankings respectively			0
" we have people with talent , people who work and people with talent who work -- and @entity25 is a person with talent who works , " says @entity27			1
@entity28 adds : " @entity25 loves windsurfing , competition			1
for sure he 's very focused on it compared to me and @entity27			0
" @entity25 says windsurfing is like a mixture of several different sports -- a combination of the laidback nature of surfing and the formality of sailing			1
" it 's tricky because you have the freedom of a wild sport , but on the other side you have the sailing part , " he says			0
" it 's mixing between the two so you have the free spirit of ' party ' and enjoying life , and the sailing part is more strict and more square			0
" exerting all parts of your body is the norm and like skiing , different disciplines exist			0
the oldest @entity25 brother spends three to five hours a day on the water and puts in 10 - 15 hours a week in the gym			1
the website of the @entity170 lists rankings in slalom , freestyle and wave but competitors can participate , too , in super x -- combining freestyle and slalom -- and speed			0
@entity179 retained its @entity181 status after originally being replaced by kiteboarding , although @entity25 does n't expect to be in @entity183 in three years because the board used is different to the one he trains with			1
he began competing in earnest as a 16 - year - old in @entity187 and has tried his hand in many of the sport 's formats , concentrating on slalom for competition and wave for fun			1
but despite enjoying his travels , @entity25 is always happy to be back in @entity5			1
" i like to stay home because we have a lot of wind almost all year , " he says			2
" maybe in the summer it 's a little tricky because it 's very warm and a lot of people are on the beach , but during the rest of the season it 's a very clement place to windsurf			0
" when we have big storms we have waves , but most of the time it 's choppy , so that 's the only bad point about @entity5			1
but around @entity5 there are two or three spots where you can do waves in proper conditions and you can travel as well			2
" i like to go when it 's super-strong wind and just be on the edge			0
when i do wave i like to show to everybody what we do -- we jump very high and we do loops			0
i like to be a little bit like a showman			0

windsurfing is a family affair for @entity25 and his younger twin brothers
@entity25 first wanted to try windsurfing as a nine - year - old in his *hometown* of @entity5
he trains about 10 - 15 hours in the gym , aside from practicing his skills on the water
@entity12 enjoys traveling the world , although lugging around his equipment is tough
