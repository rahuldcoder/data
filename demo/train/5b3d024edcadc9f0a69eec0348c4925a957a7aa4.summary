@entity0 , @entity1 -- two @entity4 senators from @entity5 intensified their calls for the @entity8 and @entity9 governments -- and oil giant @entity10 -- to provide information surrounding the circumstances of the convicted @entity15 bomber 's release a year ago			1
the @entity8 government urged @entity17 on friday not to celebrate the anniversary of the convicted bomber 's release , saying it would be " offensive and deeply insensitive " to the families of the 270 people killed in the 1988 bombing of a @entity25 flight over @entity9			1
also friday , the @entity27 administration again blasted the decision by @entity9 to release @entity29 from prison exactly a year ago on compassionate grounds due to a diagnosis of terminal cancer			1

the case has outraged many on both sides of the @entity79 , and led @entity4 senators to demand answers from @entity9 about the details of his release			1

@entity9 authorities have defended their actions in the case , saying justice secretary @entity96 relied on a medical report from the top doctor in the @entity99 , along with reports from the parole board and prison governor , in deciding to free @entity29 , who had been serving a life sentence			1
" we took the decision in good faith , " @entity88 told @entity104 on friday			0
" we followed the judicial processes , the law of @entity9 and the jurisdiction the @entity15 atrocity has been governed [ by ] , not for the last year , but for the last 20 years			2
" under the @entity112 of 1998 , @entity9 has its own government that is responsible for most of the day - to - day issues there , including the justice system			0
it took charge of the case because the flight @entity29 was convicted of bombing exploded over the @entity9 town of @entity15			2
@entity9 authorities have insisted that three doctors hired by @entity17 to assess @entity29 's condition last year played no part in the decision to release him			1
@entity46 said he wants to know what was discussed when the doctors met with @entity17 officials			0
dr. @entity130 , the director of health and care at the @entity99 , also said the three - month prognosis was a reasonable estimate			0
@entity4 senators also have repeatedly voiced suspicions that @entity9 released @entity29 as part of a deal allowing @entity10 to drill off the @entity17 coast			1
@entity88 has already shot down such concerns , saying " there is no evidence whatsoever " of any link			0
@entity46 plans to chair a @entity146 hearing in september on the controversy surrounding @entity29 's release			1
friday , @entity46 said the senators have asked the @entity8 and @entity9 governments to conduct an independent investigation in the @entity8 , which he said @entity87 supported before he became prime minister			1
@entity48 called on @entity8 and @entity9 officials to stop " stonewalling and side - tracking			2
" " help us clear the air ; help us give information to the families			0
" @entity46 also said letters are being sent to @entity17 and @entity162 leaders , inquiring whether " commercial interests " led them to pressure @entity8 and @entity9 to release @entity29			1
