-- most of us have n't lived enough to fill one memoir , let alone two , but then again most of us have not lived the life of @entity5 , the @entity6 - winning actress and daughter of late legendary director @entity8			1
@entity8 set out to write a book about her life , but it started to become a " tome " at 900 - plus pages in length , she said with a laugh during a recent interview , so she was advised by her agent to do two books			1
her second and newest memoir , aptly titled " @entity24 , " begins with her start in @entity22 , and just seven pages in , she gets to the " juicy " stuff , she admits , the start of her 17 - year - relationship with one of the biggest stars at the time , @entity30			1
' instantly in love ' she was 21 and had just been living in @entity32 for about two months , she said , when her stepmother brought her along to a party at @entity30 's house			1
" the door of this sort of ranch house opened and there was that smile , " she said with a smile			2
" and , of course , i fell instantly in love			2
" there were " lots of up and downs , " she said , especially because her " seriously handsome " companion happened to be one of the most sought - after men in the world			2
she describes being at the @entity51 when a beautiful young woman came up and offered @entity30 a ride on her motorbike			1
" he 'd go , ' well , why not ? that 's great			1
@entity57 , @entity58 , ' and off he goes , " said @entity8			1
" i 'd be kind of left in the dust like , ' what happened ? ' and so i had to negotiate that , and it was extremely hard at first			2
then you develop more of a sense of humor about it			2
" people also say to me , ' well , why did you hang on ? ' oh , why not , you know			2
i was in love , and i think maybe in a few cases i took those infidelities more seriously than he did , " she said			2
a message for women @entity8 , in her memoir , also opens up for the first time about a very troubling time in her life , when she claims her then - boyfriend , actor @entity75 , physically assaulted her			1
they were at a party together when @entity75 could n't find her and abruptly left , she said			1
she followed him and called after him			0
" and he turned around and gave me what the @entity85 describe as a ' nutter , ' which is when you take somebody 's head in your hands and smash it against your own , " she said			1
although @entity75 had a temper , @entity8 said she does n't want to " characterize him as somebody who beats up women			1
but i do n't think it 's something that men should get away with			1
" after that incident , @entity8 stopped dating @entity75			1
she has a message for any woman who finds herself in an abusive relationship			0
any man who lifts a hand against a woman is a coward in my book			0
" calls to @entity75 's representative seeking comment were not returned			1
@entity8 had plenty more to say in our interview , including her thoughts on the way @entity6 night used to be ; her first @entity114 role , beginning in january , starring in " @entity115 " with @entity116 ; and the continued challenges for women in @entity22			1
these highlights of our conversation have been edited for length and clarity			0
on how @entity6 night used to be " nobody wears clothes anymore			1
... they 're wearing very long brassieres			0
and i think it 's great to look back on old @entity6 footage ... and some of the dresses people came up with			1
... people made great mistakes			0
it was a lot of fun			0
things have gotten very much more , sort of , conventional			0
" on aging in @entity22 " for me , it 's getting better , because i 'm able to laugh at it , and i do n't take it as seriously as i used to			1
... i think we develop a sense of humor about these things that we go through			0
we can laugh at them			0
... you do n't have to fret so much about how you look			0
you look the way you look			0
hopefully , you 're happy			0
" on the challenges for women in @entity22 " i just wish ladies got better parts in movies these days			0
i wish we could see more of them ... young and old			0
... i remember going to a ' women in film ' meeting			0
@entity157 , it 's got to be 25 years ago , and all the women there were , some of them were saying , ' oh , things are so much better for women			1
' and the others were saying things were worse for women			0
well , i think they 're worse			0
" on her first @entity114 role starring in " @entity115 " opposite @entity116 in january " i 'm nervous and excited and thrilled , and it 's going to be great for me			1
it 's a brand new thing			2
i love to do new things			0
i hope it 's all going to go well			2
... i 'm sort of terrified of live audiences ... but it 's a good time to challenge myself			2
why not ? " on @ anjelicahuston recently joining @entity172 " i 'm looking forward to having nice conversations and meeting my fans			0
... i think it 's pretty wonderful in an ideological way			2
the idea that people can contact each other and contact you , and you can all have a kind of massive conversation i think is probably what 's going to save the world			2
" on the story behind the title of her new memoir , " @entity24 " " i guess i was about 28 , 29 years old , and i 'd been dabbling around the outskirts of show business for some time , doing little parts here and there			1
... and i was at a party , and the director @entity193 was there , with whom i 'd worked years before ... and he said , ' oh , @entity5 , come over here			1
sit on my lap , poor little you			0
you 're never going to do anything with your life			0
you have so much talent and so little to show for it			0
' and i looked at him with love and just a little bit of hate , and i thought , ' watch me			0
' " and we 've been watching her and loving her on the big and small screen ever since ! what do you think of @entity5 's reflections in her new memoir ? share your thoughts with @entity213 on @entity172 or @entity214 on @entity215 .			1
