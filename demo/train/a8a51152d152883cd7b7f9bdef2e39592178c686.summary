traveling while breast - feeding is no easy feat in the best of circumstances			1
when @entity5 officials do n't follow the agency 's rules , getting through the airport with the gear -- and a baby -- gets more difficult			1
a breast - feeding incident that has had @entity5 critics buzzing since last week was addressed in an apologetic blog post thursday from the agency 's " @entity16 " @entity14			1
the controversy started when an agent at @entity23 's @entity22 in @entity24 would n't allow passenger @entity25 to board a plane february 29 with her breast pump because the milk bottles were empty , @entity18 affiliate @entity17 in @entity19 reported			1
as a result @entity25 used her electric breast pump in a public airport restroom to fill the bottles and get them through security			2
she was traveling with her 9 - month - old daughter , @entity34			0
" i had to stand in front of the mirrors and the sinks and pump my breast , in front of every tourist that walked into that bathroom , " @entity25 told @entity17			0
@entity5 admitted its agent made a mistake shortly afterward , saying in a statement : " we accept responsibility for the apparent misunderstanding and any inconvenience or embarrassment this incident may have caused her			1
the officer in question is receiving remedial training			1
" @entity14 , the @entity5 blogger , announced thursday that the agency has updated its website " to help clarify the procedures for traveling with ice packs , breast milk , juice , and water			1
" the policy explained on the site now explicitly says that ice packs and empty bottles are permitted through security			2
" mistakes such as this happen from time to time and for that we are truly sorry , " @entity14 wrote			0
" however , we can and have learned from mistakes in the past , so please be sure to let us know when you think or know something could have been handled differently			0
" @entity14 advised passengers to ask for a supervisor in uncomfortable situations or to call @entity5 customer service numbers listed in his post -- 866 - 289 - 9673 and 855 - 787 - 2227			2
commenters on @entity14 ' post were n't all satisfied with his advice			0
one said : " 1 ) it has been frequently reported that @entity5 staff do not care whether or not something has been clearly stated on the website when they are imposing their own understanding of the rules ; 2 ) it has been frequently reported that polite requests to speak with supervisors are treated as defiant behavior			0
" those comments may refer to a 2010 incident involving a breast - feeding mother that resulted in a lawsuit against the @entity5 and @entity96			1
according to the suit , @entity97 was traveling with breast milk for her 7 - month - old son and requested alternate screening for the milk at a @entity104 checkpoint to avoid x-ray exposure			0
the suit says the same @entity5 agents she had encountered in the security line at the airport the week before retaliated against her for filing a complaint when her request for alternate screening for her breast milk in that instance met with resistance			2
the suit alleges that on her second encounter with the agents , @entity97 was directed to a " special inspection " area , where her requests to speak to a manager were refused			0
a uniformed police officer was also called in , according to court filings			0
@entity97 is suing on grounds of intentional infliction of emotional distress , invasion of privacy and false imprisonment			0
the suit alleges that screeners initially refused to review a printout that @entity97 provided of @entity5 guidelines pertaining to breast milk			2
the @entity5 said it sent a letter of apology to @entity97 shortly afterward			0
despite some less - than - smooth incidents , many breast - feeding mothers pass through security with no trouble			1
one woman who said she 's a nursing mother and has n't had any trouble with security commented on the @entity145 incident : " like several have said , this is not representative of @entity5 as an agency , but the stupidity of that particular agent			2
" breast - feeding moms , what are your experiences of traveling while nursing ? please share your comments below .			1
