-- there are two certainties in airline seat pockets : pretzel crumbs and @entity5			1
and while most travelers try to avoid the mysterious debris left by passengers past , @entity5 has been a welcome addition to the seatback catchalls since the 1990s			1
" i found that it was one of those things that anyone who had traveled in the @entity18 kind of knew about , " said @entity11 , a freelance travel writer who reviews @entity5 products for the travel site @entity14			1
" some people are in business class ; some people are in economy ... some people like to travel , and some people hate it			2
" the catalog 's merchandising team receives hundreds of inquiries every week from vendors , manufacturers and retailers who want their items to be featured , said @entity35 , customer experience manager for @entity5			1
" we 're looking for really special items , " @entity35 said			2
" we have to look at it and say , ' this solves a problem , and this is so unique			2
i know our customers will love it			0
' " and where else could you purchase a @entity48 wand , an indoor dog restroom and a fire escape ladder , all from the same place ? the merchandising team has been doing its job so well for so long that it can just look at an item and know it 's going to be a winner with @entity5 's audience , @entity35 said			1
" we have this garden zombie -- the size of a person -- crawling out of the ground , " he said			0
" when i saw it , i was like , ' no way			0
' but sure enough , it became one of our top sellers			0
" other " unique " items are n't so lucky			2
if you thought the catalog 's products were humorous , the list of rejects is downright silly			1
there 's @entity75 the @entity76 , a " hip line of barf bags " ; @entity79 , which helps women urinate while standing ; and @entity81 , which " turns ordinary hot dogs into a smiling ' hot dog man			2
' " " you almost expect them to be fake products from ' @entity86 , ' " @entity11 said			0
" i think the fact that these things actually exist just makes people happy			0
" @entity11 's first experience with a @entity5 product was the @entity92 , a giant , wedge - shaped travel pillow that he reviewed for @entity14 in 2008			1
" if you brought up @entity5 in conversation , it was the one product that someone would make a joke about , " he said			1
" a ) because it was so large and b ) because the person in the photograph sleeping on it looked so uncomfortable			0
" since his first experience , @entity11 has bought two photo blankets and @entity106 , a @entity108 statue , for his friends			0
" seeing these fun , silly things takes your mind off what is normally a very tedious or uncomfortable situation , " @entity11 said of flying			0
the same goes for comedian @entity117 , who took 84 flights in 2010 and purchases from @entity5 regularly			1
" there 's that time between when you ca n't use your laptop when you 're taking off and landing , so that 's prime @entity5 time , " @entity117 said			1
" their selection is so varied that pretty much anybody from any walk of life could pick it up and find something			0
" from a @entity134 keychain to video recording sunglasses , @entity117 has seen it all -- including a submarine			0
" that was a little bit beyond my budget , " he said , laughing			0
" once in a while , they 'll throw in something ridiculously expensive and frivolous like that			0
" for @entity11 , that item was the @entity145 , which combines " the ability to have cold food or a beverage handy along with the means to get somewhere , without walking , " according to its website			0
for $ 500 , the motorized cooler just was n't worth it to him			0
" i do n't even know where i 'd drive it , " @entity11 said			0
the fun nature of the items featured in the catalog reflects the company 's attitude , said @entity160 , ceo of @entity5			1
" we 're a company that has high expectations for ourselves , but fun is in our corporate motto , " @entity160 said			0
" that 's what makes @entity5 what it is			1
we scour the @entity170 to find unique and innovative products			0
" as proved by the popularity of the corpse zombie , it 's hard to know what will work until it 's put in front of 1.6 million people per day , she said			2
but @entity5 was n't always so quirky			1
when it began in 1990 , founder @entity180 pictured @entity5 carrying mainstream products but quickly found that people were wary of buying everyday items at an airport			1
" i think people feel that anything at the airport is going to be overpriced , " @entity180 said			1
" so what works are unique items that people ca n't find anywhere else			2
if they can buy it at the store , then they will probably buy it there			0
" since @entity180 's original plans for the catalog evolved , @entity5 is more successful than ever			1
the catalog is available on 88 percent of domestic flights and reaches more than 650 million air travelers each year , according to its website			1
" at the end of the day , while everyone laughs at the silly products , i have to imagine that the thing that keeps them going are the practical items , " @entity11 said			2
" not everyone wants to spend money on a conversation piece			0
" for example , the best - selling items in @entity5 's history were a nose hair trimmer and a mosquito magnet ( a net that attracts and traps insects ) , quantity-wise and dollar-wise , respectively			1
" products that solve problems are the ones that work best in @entity5 , " @entity35 said			1
the items have to solve a purpose , even if that purpose is just making someone smile			2
" and with the spreading availability of @entity229 on flights , @entity5 has more smiles to look forward to on the horizon			2
its deal with @entity234 allows passengers to browse @entity5 for free , escalating what is already a niche market			1
" @entity5 is perfect for things you do n't necessarily need but would make great conversation pieces if you were willing to be silly and whimsical enough to actually buy them , " @entity11 said			2
" it solves the problems we did n't know we had until it told us about them			0

@entity5 's merchandising team receives hundreds of inquiries every week from vendors
