@entity0 , @entity1 -- there was a lot to appreciate in yesterday 's bipartisan @entity6 health care summit between president @entity7 and members of @entity9			1
this is the kind of thing that our leaders ought to do three or four times a year on a variety of issues -- from @entity17 to education to immigration to job creation			2
why not ? put aside the sound bites and partisan barbs			0
get beyond the dueling appearances on the sunday morning talk shows			0
and bring your best ideas and most constructive suggestions to the table			0
@entity7 deserves credit for convening the meeting			0
his opening remarks were good , especially when he talked about the rising costs of health insurance premiums , the " exploding costs of @entity35 and @entity36 , " and how he wanted to " make sure that this discussion is actually a discussion and not just us trading talking points			0
" i also appreciated his candid discussion of health scares years ago involving his own daughters and how he wondered " what would have happened if i did n't have reliable health care ? " and his acknowledgement that " everybody here understands the desperation that people feel when they 're sick			1
" that is , assuming everything that happened yesterday at @entity52 was real -- and not merely a theatrical setup for a @entity56 - led effort next week to push through , using reconciliation , what @entity56 on the @entity61 call " the big bill			1
" that 's @entity7 's comprehensive $ 950 billion plan to radically reform the nation 's health care system -- the one opposed by every @entity66 in @entity9 and , according to polls , a majority of @entity69			1
reconciliation is a procedural maneuver that allows the @entity72 to pass the health care bill with 51 votes rather than the 60 votes required to end a filibuster			1
yet , according to a recent @entity79 poll , more than half of @entity69 -- 52 percent -- oppose @entity56 resorting to reconciliation to pass a bill			1
and while @entity66 are still holding out hope that @entity7 and congressional @entity56 will go back to the drawing board and start with a blank piece of paper , that appears unlikely since @entity56 seem to be " all in " on their piece of legislation			1
so what was the point of the summit ? it might well have been to create a foil			0
according to what an unnamed @entity56 official told @entity95 , the purpose of the event was to give a face to gridlock			1
@entity56 intend over the next few weeks to spin this narrative suggesting that they tried , really tried , to work with @entity66 but the " party of no " was just too obstinate and too uncompromising			2
so @entity56 had no choice but to rely on the perfectly legitimate process known as reconciliation			2
so the summit was a fraud ? a charade ? i hope not			2
even in @entity110 , there has to be a limit to cynicism			2
and i 'd hope this would be it			0
i 'd hope that @entity7 and @entity56 lawmakers would n't toy with the @entity69 people on an issue as important as this one			1
the public wants solutions to our health care problems -- however they 're defined -- and not partisan gimmicks that give " a face to gridlock			1
" even many of those @entity69 who oppose the @entity56 plan turn around to tell pollsters , in the next breath , that the current system has too much cost and not enough common sense			2
no one approves of the status quo			0
that 's at least something to agree on			0
and while @entity7 got a lot of things right in his remarks , he also made a big mistake when -- at the very outset of the discussion -- he defined as the baseline " the @entity6 and the @entity72 legislation that 's already passed			2
" that told @entity66 that they were not getting their blank sheet of paper , and that the best they could hope for was to tweak but not substantially change the @entity56 plans			1
it also did something else			0
it reminded the @entity69 people of who calls the shots in @entity110			2
it 's the party in power			0
@entity56 control all the levers of government , at both ends of @entity162			1
for president @entity7 and the @entity56 congressional leadership , the real obstacles to reform are n't @entity66 -- who do n't have any power -- but fellow @entity56 who are up for re-election and who are terrified of " the big bill			1
" they represent districts that either @entity7 lost to @entity175 in 2008 or in which @entity7 barely squeaked out a victory			0
so they 're not going anywhere near this unpopular piece of legislation			0
who can blame them ? whatever happens on health care , @entity56 alone deserve , depending on your view , either the credit or the blame			1
you see , the real face of gridlock is theirs			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity194			0

@entity196 lauds the health care summit , says leaders ought to hold more such events
@entity196 : let 's hope it was real and not *preparation* for @entity56 to pass unpopular health bill
@entity196 : @entity56 control levers of government in @entity110
some *democrats* up for re-election are terrified of passing " the big bill , " he writes
