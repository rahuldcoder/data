-- @entity1 's 2014 has been something of a roller - coaster ride but the year could still end on a high in the colt 's final race of the @entity7 thoroughbred horse racing season at @entity8 the peaks of a @entity11 triumph and a six - race winning streak have been matched by the disappointing lows of narrowly missing out on the @entity15 and a three - and - a - half - month layoff to rest			1
yet victory in the @entity18 on saturday could be enough to consign those darker memories to the past and fire the three - year - old chestnut colt to the prestigious @entity23 accolade at january 's @entity24 -- an annual ceremony recognizing the year 's best thoroughbred horses			1
" winning the award after all these setbacks would be even sweeter , " @entity1 's trainer @entity27 told @entity0			1
" it would be a great accomplishment for @entity1 and the highlight of the year for him			2
to win the @entity24 would really be something special			2
" coming out on top at the grade 1 meet at @entity37 's @entity8 will be no easy task , however , given that it will be his maiden race on turf			1
in the days leading up to the event , @entity27 and jockey @entity42 have been working the horse hard on grass in anticipation that he will feel as at home there as he has done for much of the season on dirt			1
" i do n't think him running on grass for the first time will be a problem myself , i have a good feeling about this , " @entity27 says			1
" if he gets the win then i think he deserves to be named @entity23			2
to win on grass would be a whole new dimension for him , with his running style , so the voters would have to appreciate that			1
" an eventful year victory on grass would seal a fourth grade 1 triumph of the year -- two more than any of his rivals have managed in 2014			1
the three previous successes came at the @entity71 , the @entity11 and the @entity72 -- part of a six - race winning streak that captured the @entity7 public 's imagination and set up the possibility of a first @entity15 win in the sport since 1978			1
" he got better and better as he turned three , he just got more mature , " says @entity27 , who became the oldest trainer to win the @entity11 in may at the age of 77			1
" he really is something else , the @entity85			0
i 've had some great horses , but i 've never had one like him			0
" the @entity11 and @entity72 triumphs , however , could not be replicated in june 's @entity89 -- the three - year - old had to settle for fourth -- and so the wait for a 12th horse to achieve the @entity15 goes on			1
@entity93 -- one of the horse 's two principal owners -- reacted to the loss with a barrage of unsporting criticism and was later humiliated in the media for what was perceived as a severe case of sour grapes			0
@entity27 , meanwhile , still struggles to talk about the @entity15 near miss , and @entity1 himself has yet to record a victory since the disappointment at @entity106			1
" i thought we could win that @entity15 going into the last race , " @entity27 recalls			1
" but @entity1 had problems in the race -- he was stuck and could n't get out , he was stuck down in the railing			0
" you hate making excuses for the horse , except i think he could have been the winner , i really do			0
the @entity15 would really have been something			2
it would have been a real highlight			0
" despite the setback , @entity27 remains confident that the chestnut colt 's record this year will be " enough " to at least secure the three - year - old - male title at the @entity24 , with a trophy being presented to the most impressive horse in each division			1
ifs and buts had @entity1 won the @entity128 in october the @entity23 award may have been a formality , but he could only finish third			2
the controversial race perhaps should have been more fruitful had @entity132 of @entity133 -- who finished first and second respectively -- been disqualified for early collisions involving the unfortunate @entity136			0
" it was frustrating watching the way the start went , it was very controversial ... we 're dealing with a $ 5 million race here , " says @entity27			2
" if we 'd have won the @entity128 , the @entity24 would have been tied up by now			2
if there had been a double disqualification then we would have won			0
" " but timing is everything in this game , " @entity27 adds on @entity1 's return from his rest period			2
" i never got the chance to get a strong race out of him afterwards			0
i think that 's what cost us the @entity128 , to be honest with you			0
" looking ahead while 2014 appears to be tinged with a sense of regret for @entity27 , it is still a year that has brought about unforeseeable levels of success , and the future remains bright for @entity1			1
despite persistent rumors that the three - year - old might not even race next year , it has since been confirmed that the chestnut colt will be back on the track in 2015			1
" the success this year has n't come without its setbacks			0
but when you 're running horses you 're always going to have setbacks and you ca n't have a perfect trip , " @entity27 says			2
" i was n't 100 % sure if he was going to race anymore			0
there were rumors that people were going to try to buy him , but the owners want to race him at four years old			0
" he will be racing next season and the future is looking good , you bet			0
" lost among the excitement of looking ahead to the future for @entity1 , while also reflecting on this year 's achievements , it can be easy to forget about the horse 's humble beginnings and just how the story all started			0
@entity93 and co-owner @entity190 splashed out a mere $ 10,000 in total , paying $ 8,000 for mare @entity193 in 2009 , before then later breeding her to stallion @entity194 for a reduced fee of $ 2,000			0
fast forward to today , and that investment has produced an offspring which has amassed $ 4 million in career earnings , is said to be worth in the region of $ 12 million and is potentially one race away from being crowned the supreme horse of 2014			0
" winning the award would really be something , and what a great story for everyone to write about given the horse has gone from a $ 10,000 investment to making the money he has made , " @entity27 says			1
" it 's a poor man 's dream			0
