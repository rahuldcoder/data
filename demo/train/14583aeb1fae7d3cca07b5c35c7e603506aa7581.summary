@entity0 -- rep. @entity3 's journey from @entity5 's favorite son to politically embattled @entity0 insider to campaign victor is a saga that spans more than 40 years and is the type of tale that only seems possible in the soap opera - like world of inside the @entity14 politics			1
@entity3 's comeback tale is as much a testament to his political savvy as it is the resiliency of the area he represents			1
" one of the great things about @entity3 is his longevity			1
and there are lots of people who see his ability to stay on the game as representative of @entity5 , " said @entity22 , an african - american studies professor at @entity23 and author of " new black man : rethinking @entity33			1
" " the idea of @entity5 always being on the ropes and being able to bounce back , that 's been the story of @entity3 's political career			1
" @entity3 claimed victory tuesday in the @entity41 primary to represent a redrawn , largely @entity45 @entity44 district , capping a tale of political survival for the lawmaker , whose @entity50 colleagues censured him for ethics violations after his re-election to his 21st term in 2010			1
on tuesday night , he offered relieved thanks to supporters at his campaign headquarters in @entity44 after clinching the five - way race for the nomination in his @entity5 - area district			1
the new 13th @entity60 stretches from @entity5 to the northwest @entity61			0
" they 've had enough trust in me , they say , ' @entity3 , we think you can do it			1
we want you on our team in the @entity61 , ' " he said			0
" and so i can tell everybody who do n't know this district or the @entity61 , when i 'm walking the streets of the @entity61 , i feel my district and the blood and the minds and the ambitions and the things that people want for their children			2
" @entity3 netted about 45 % of the vote , compared with his closest rival , @entity44 sen. @entity82 , who got about 40 % in the latest count			2
@entity3 received 80 % of the vote in the 2010 primary			1
@entity82 , 57 , who would have been the first @entity88 - @entity87 to serve in the @entity50 , used his background to court @entity45 votes and take aim at the 82 - year - old @entity3 over his long tenure in @entity0 and his ethics abuses			1
on tuesday , @entity82 sent a note to supporters , thanking them and conceding the race			0
" though we did n't make it to the finish line tonight , the values we fought for and the communities we seek to improve will continue to light a fire in us , " he said			0
" the truth is , even in coming a bit short , we made history			0
" @entity3 knows about fighting			2
he grew up in poverty , was abandoned by his @entity109 father and lived with an aunt and uncle in the @entity61			0
the high school dropout enlisted in the @entity113 and was awarded the @entity114 for valor in the @entity116 after he helped rescue 40 men trapped behind @entity119 lines			0
after the war , he used the @entity121 to earn a degree from @entity123 and a law degree from @entity125			0
he served as an assistant @entity127 attorney before being elected to the @entity128 in 1966			0
@entity3 began his long run in the @entity50 in 1970 when he defeated another flamboyant and beloved longtime @entity5 politician , rep. @entity130 , in the @entity41 primary			2
years later , he defeated @entity130 's son in the 2010 @entity41 primary			2
but in his most recent contest , the congressman faced changing demographics and a redrawn district with more latino - americans than african - americans , a shift that helped @entity82			1
though he now represents a district that is more heavily @entity45 , the @entity87 - @entity87 community 's traditionally higher voter turnout rates helped @entity3 win , said @entity145 , editor of @entity50 races for the @entity147			1
" his 2010 primary was more of a referendum on ethics			2
this was more a test of ethnic strength and a referendum on @entity3 's fitness for office , " @entity151 said			1
" he delivered a more tenacious campaign closer to @entity159 , and he was able to count on very loyal support to win a low - turnout primary			2
" @entity3 , one - time chairman of the @entity162 , was censured by the lower chamber in 2010 after he was found guilty of ethics violations			1
he failed to pay income taxes for a rental unit in the @entity167 , filed misleading financial disclosure reports and set up his campaign office in a building where he lives , among other breaches			0
pundits predicted an end to his political career at the time , pointing to previous ethics problems and the potential of redistricting after the 2010 census			1
" the power of incumbency was on full display when rep. @entity3 won his primary on tuesday , " said @entity180 , president of @entity181 , a watchdog group			2
" while @entity188 ' rating is in the single digits and several incumbents have lost primaries around the country , rep. @entity3 is still extremely popular in @entity5			2
his re-election is both a testament to his longevity and a reflection of his constituents , who clearly do n't seem to mind his ethical lapses			0
" still , the dapper lawmaker has a core of ardent supporters			0
" he is a consummate public servant , and public service is not easy whenever your life is open for constant scrutiny and everything you do is under a microscope , " said @entity44 assemblyman @entity202 , a co-chairman of the state @entity41			0
" he 's from @entity5			2
we 've done nothing but have to fight for whatever we have to achieve			0
" in @entity188 , @entity3 was among the leading voices in the fight against drug trafficking , pushed for low - income housing tax credits and authored legislation to support urban communities			1
he became the first @entity87 - @entity87 chairman of the powerful @entity162 after @entity41 won control of the @entity50 in 2006			0
he also helped create the @entity222 , an organization that represents @entity87 members of @entity188			0
despite the new district lines and some recent health problems , @entity3 fought hard to keep his seat , squaring off with his opponents in debates and taking them on during campaign stops			1
" one of my opponents said that i got the idea that i 'm the only person that can do the job , that i 'm the smartest person in the world and no one is smart enough to do it			0
i said , ' that 's not so			0
i 'm just smarter than you , ' " @entity3 said last week , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity239			2
@entity3 and @entity82 faced fellow democrats @entity241 , a business executive ; former @entity3 intern @entity244 ; and former @entity246 aide @entity245 to win control of the 13th @entity60			1
@entity44 gov. @entity248 endorsed @entity3 on friday , citing his decades of service and ability to " bring things back to the state of @entity44			1
" however , @entity44 's three major daily newspapers each endorsed a different one of @entity3 's opponents , prompting a fierce defense from the @entity257 native			1
and on tuesday , though a bit chastened by his tough political slog , he offered a bit of trademark spark			0
" if ( the newspaper editorial boards ) did n't think , after 42 years , that i was the best qualified , i promise them in the next two years , they 'll have no question of the fact that you elected the best			0
" @entity1 's @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			0
