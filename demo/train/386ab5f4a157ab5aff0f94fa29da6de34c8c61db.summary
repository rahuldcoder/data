-- a publicly funded school in @entity2 said tuesday that it may rethink requiring students suspected of being pregnant to be tested medically and , if pregnant , to be home schooled			2
" there have never been any complaints from students or parents about the school 's policy , " @entity6 principal @entity5 said in a statement issued a day after the @entity8 sent him a letter criticizing the policy			1
" however , in light of the recent inquiry , the current policy has been forwarded to the law firm of @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity2 , to ensure that necessary revisions are made so that our school is in full compliance with the constitutional law			1
" under the school 's policy , which is posted on its website , " the school reserves the right to require any female student to take a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not the suspected student is in fact pregnant			1
" in cases where a test determines that one of the school 's approximately 700 students is pregnant , " the student will not be permitted to attend classes on the campus of @entity6 , " it says			1
it adds that any student suspected of being pregnant who refuses to submit to a pregnancy test " shall be treated as a pregnant student and will be offered home study opportunities			1
if home study opportunities are not acceptable , the student will be counseled to seek other educational opportunities			2
" study : teen access to @entity56 uneven in a letter sent monday to school officials , @entity8 executive director @entity57 said the policy " is based on the archaic and pernicious stereotype that a girl 's pregnancy sets a ' bad example ' for her peers -- i.e. , that in having engaged in sexual activity , she has transgressed acceptable norms of feminine behavior			1
" the news that the policy would be reviewed was welcomed by @entity71 , director of the @entity72 , who described the policy as " reminiscent of the ' 50s			0
" @entity71 said any revisions should ensure no student is forced to take a pregnancy test and no pregnant student ordered out of the classroom			1
" girls who are pregnant today deserve the right to be in class just the same as women who are pregnant deserve the right to be in the workplace , " @entity71 said			0
" that 's the law			0
" @entity87 , a legal fellow at @entity8 's @entity88 , said the organization had not heard directly from the school			1
" we are , of course , encouraged that they are saying that they will try to bring their policy into compliance and we hope they do this ... in time for the school year to start			2
" august 15 is the first day of classes			0
if that does n't happen , she said , the school should suspend the policy until revisions are made			2
" as it now stands , there are numerous constitutional violations as well as violating @entity112 , " she said , referring to the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools			0
" if they do n't suspend it immediately , we are considering taking further legal action			0
" no one from the school or from the law firm responded to @entity0 's requests for comment			0
sex education in schools @entity123 contributed to this report for @entity0			0

under current policy , the school can require a student to take a pregnancy test
if the test proves *positive* , " the student will not be permitted to attend classes " on campus
the @entity8 *challenges* the policy as *unconstitutional*
