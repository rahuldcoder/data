-- cattle carcasses dot the desert			0
more beggars show up at street corners in the capital , @entity6			0
these are indications that @entity8 is on the brink of catastrophe , say aid workers			1
but few outside the country have noticed these signs in one of the world 's least developed nations			1
and now an encroaching emergency caused by months of severe drought is threatening to leave 8 million people , or half the nation 's population , hungry			1
the @entity23 ' @entity22 announced tuesday that it is " massively scaling up " food distribution to people who have lost crops and livestock			1
in this nomadic , pastoral nation , they are people who have lost everything			2
" the drought in @entity8 is an unfolding catastrophe for millions of people and we are struggling against time to scale up quickly enough to reach the escalating number of hungry , " said @entity32 , executive director for the @entity23 agency			1
@entity32 traveled to @entity8 to see the crisis for herself and saw a landlocked , drought - prone nation where hunger has been growing steadily since the last harvest in september 2009			1
" we are massively scaling up special nutritional help for children under two years of age , whose brains and bodies face permanent damage from acute malnutrition , " said @entity32 in a statement released tuesday after her visit			0
the agency said it aims to feed about 8 million people through the end of the year by distributing food rations that include a corn and soy supplement , a peanut paste and vitamin - fortified sugar and milk for children			1
earlier this month , 10 leading international aid agencies had called for a surge in the humanitarian response to the hunger crisis across the @entity69 region of west and @entity71 -- 2 million more people are threatened in @entity74 and thousands others in @entity75 , @entity76 , parts of @entity78 and northern @entity79			1
but @entity8 is at the heart			2
and despite months of warnings , the money for emergency aid has been what aid agencies described as paltry			0
the @entity23 needs another $ 229 million to reach its recently revised target aid amount of $ 371 million			0
the @entity22 's appeal follows a similar call by the @entity23 @entity89 , which earlier this month increased the aid requirement for @entity8 to $ 253 million from $ 191 million			1
the food agency said it only has half the $ 213 million it needs to expand its feeding operation			2
" i think it has been a really slow onset emergency , " said @entity94 , chief of missions in @entity8 for the aid agency @entity96			2
" we got very little response from donors			0
" that 's partly because @entity8 's has been an invisible problem so far			1
there are not yet thousands of people starving			2
nor are there images of distended bellies and bones piercing out of flesh , as there were in the @entity112 famine in the 1990s			0
the markets still carry fresh fruit for those who can travel far and have deep pockets			0
but , @entity94 said , if things are allowed to go on this way , human suffering will become unbearable			0
@entity121 ' colleague @entity120 , @entity96 's emergency director who just returned from 10 days in eastern @entity8 , said the people of @entity8 have no way to survive without their livestock			1
their future is dying with the animals			0
" they have to start a new life , " she said			0
but without rain , it will be difficult .			0
