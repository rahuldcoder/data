-- a @entity2 congressman called on the federal government tuesday to distribute potassium iodide pills to @entity5 living near nuclear reactors , a preventive step one expert warns might do more harm than good			1
rep. @entity10 wants the federal government to distribute doses of the compound -- which can be used to block the thyroid gland 's absorption of radioactive iodine -- to every household within a 20 - mile radius of a @entity5 nuclear power plant " in recognition of the probability that rapid evacuation during a nuclear meltdown will be difficult and time consuming			1
" @entity10 , @entity2 , said the battle to halt a suspected meltdown at a @entity28 plant should spur the @entity30 administration to action			2
" despite more than 30 years of clear and unequivocal evidence that potassium iodide protects people , especially young children , who are most vulnerable , from cancer - causing releases of radioactive iodine that would occur if a nuclear disaster occurred , the nuclear industry has continued to fight its use , " @entity10 said at a press conference			1
a 2002 law calls for the @entity5 government to make stockpiles of potassium iodide available to states and local governments in preparation for a possible nuclear accident , but the congressman said the provision has not been enforced			1
" the @entity28 nuclear disaster is the reminder we need that the law should be followed , and @entity5 children should be protected in the event of another nuclear meltdown here on @entity5 soil , " @entity10 said in a statement issued by his office			0
the congressmen urged potassium iodide be stockpiled in schools , hospitals and other places within the 20 - mile radius			1
@entity10 is the ranking @entity69 on the @entity70 and a former chairman of the @entity73 subcommittee on the environment			0
he was a leading critic of @entity75 during last year 's massive oil spill in the @entity77 , pushing the oil company to release more information about the disaster			0
since the crisis at a @entity28 power station that followed the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , he has called for a safety review of @entity5 nuclear plants			0
@entity10 said tuesday he plans to introduce legislation to overhaul nuclear safety			0
the bill imposes a moratorium on new reactor licenses until " new safety requirements are in place			0
" the bill , he said , would require reactors to have backup power supplies and systems that can withstand " earthquakes , tsunamis , strong storms and long power outages			2
" but dr. @entity102 , a radiation oncologist at @entity105 's @entity104 , called @entity10 's potassium iodide proposal " a well - intentioned but bad idea			1
" " the idea of trying to protect people and trying to prevent illness is always a good idea , " said @entity102 , a @entity0 consultant			1
but he said the pills carry side effects that might be worse than low doses of radiation -- and they have " very little likelihood " of being used , " except by people who might be so anxious that they might use them inappropriately			1
" radioactive iodine is among the contaminants released from the earthquake - damaged @entity121 nuclear power plant in northern @entity28 , where crews have spent more than two weeks trying to prevent meltdowns in three of its six reactors			1
potassium iodide blocks the absorption of radioactive iodine isotopes by filling the thyroid with the benign iodine compound , stopping the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine			0
this reduces the risk of cancer from exposure			0
its use is recommended for children in particular , because they would have a higher risk of thyroid cancers , but it does n't protect against radiation from other elements -- nor does it protect any other organs from radiation exposure			2
the supplement disappeared from some store shelves in @entity149 this month after trace amounts of radioactivity were picked up by sensors on the @entity5 @entity153 , even as @entity149 's emergency management agency warned residents against taking it			1
" it is not necessary given the current circumstances in @entity28 , " the agency said			0
" it can present a danger to people with allergies to iodine , shellfish or who have thyroid problems , and taken inappropriately , it can have serious side effects			2
" @entity102 said that ideally , if a nuclear accident happened , health departments would tell people in the affected areas when they should take a dose of the compound			2
but having potassium iodide at hand can be a problem as well			0
" because just like people are running out and trying to hoard these pills , that anxiety might lead them to take the medication when they are told there is some detectable amount of iodine - 131 in the atmosphere , when it 's not enough of a concentration to be health concern			1
" @entity188 , director of the @entity189 at @entity190 , said his main message is the @entity5 should be prepared for a potential disaster			0
" @entity5 should n't take it ( potassium iodide ) now because @entity5 are not , at the moment at risk , so they should not take it now , " @entity188 said			0
" this should not be an advisory for people to go out and stockpile potassium iodide themselves necessarily			2
" @entity0 's @entity202 contributed to this report .			1
