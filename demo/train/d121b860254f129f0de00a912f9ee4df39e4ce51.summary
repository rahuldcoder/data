-- @entity1 was announced as @entity3 's new driver thursday , but is the @entity5 racer already getting itchy feet ? the 23 - year - old lost his drive with @entity9 less than a month ago and @entity1 is determined to prove he deserves another chance with a front - running @entity12 team			1
" i learned a lot at @entity9 last year , " @entity1 , who last year finished 11th in the drivers ' championship , told @entity0			1
" @entity9 made me a better driver than i was before i joined them			1
i learned a lot and i 'm really looking forward to proving myself in 2014 ; achieving great things , good results			0
" hopefully we can have a strong car and confirm once again to top teams that i 'm the right one for them			0
" hopefully i can do that and have another chance in a top team in a winning car			1
" for now , the @entity5 's immediate future lies with @entity3 , the @entity30 - based team who were ranked as 2013 's fifth fastest team before the introduction of new @entity35 tires halfway through the season saw their early season form fade			1
the team , overseen by @entity40 tycoon @entity39 , finished sixth in the team standings with @entity43 @entity42 and @entity45 's @entity44 at the wheel , both of whom are now without a drive in @entity12			2
next season sees @entity1 partner highly - rated @entity43 @entity52 , who is returning for a second stint as a @entity3 driver			1
" i 'm happy now that i know what i 'm doing for next year , " said @entity1 , who took three podiums for @entity56 in a breakthrough 2012 season that helped earn him a step up to @entity9 as @entity60 's replacement			1
" i 'm very excited to join a young team full of energy , full of hunger to prove itself			2
" @entity52 is one of the best drivers out there , there 's no doubt about it			2
he 's still looking for a great opportunity for his future and it 's the same for me			0
" i think we are one of the strongest driver lineups on the grid			0
" @entity39 insisted neither of his 2013 drivers had done anything to warrant the axe but that that the time had come for a change			0
with a major technical rule change on the horizon in 2014 and a smattering of new rules , which include a dose of double points at the season finale in @entity90 , the @entity40 businessman believes he has chosen the right duo to drive forward a new era for his team			0
" i 'm very , very happy with our driver lineup , " @entity39 told @entity0			2
" i could n't have done better than @entity52 and @entity1			1
" i 've always backed those drivers who have exceptional talent and who are basically gutsy and hungry and @entity1 certainly fits that bill			0
" i watched him at @entity56 and he did an excellent job , no surprise that @entity9 picked him up			0
" i saw at times what @entity1 did to my own drivers on the track and i said that this guy meets the criteria i 'm looking for , exceptionally talented , quick and he has fire in his belly			0
" @entity52 has some history with the team , joining them as a reserve in 2011 before being promoted to a race seat in 2012			1
the 26 - year - old then joined @entity56 as @entity1 's replacement last season			2
despite the @entity43 being a known quantity , @entity39 insists he will not be the team leader in 2014			0
" there is no number one or number two or senior and junior , they should have healthy competition amongst themselves , " he insisted			0
but , if @entity1 wanted an extra incentive to prove his talents when the new season beings in march , then his new boss might have given it to him			1
" @entity52 , i have a huge amount of respect for his talent , " @entity39 mused			0
" one day i think he will be world champion			1
