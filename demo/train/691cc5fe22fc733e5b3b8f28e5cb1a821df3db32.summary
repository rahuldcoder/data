@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's foreign affairs ministry is contradicting @entity6 president @entity5 's statement about @entity1 's debt obligations			1
southern @entity9 voters are heading to the polls this week to determine whether they should secede from @entity1			1
the question of how to split @entity1 's debt is one of several issues that would have to be resolved if the south votes for independence , as is widely expected			1
on monday , @entity5 told @entity2 that @entity9 president @entity19 " said the entire debt should be assigned to north @entity1 and not to the southern part of @entity1			1
so , in effect , @entity1 is starting with a clean sheet on debt			1
they 'll have to make some arrangements for other sources of income , of course			0
" the @entity28 reported monday the country 's foreign affairs ministry " categorically refuted the statements			2
" it said the ministry 's spokesman , @entity33 , explained that during the @entity5 meeting , @entity19 affirmed @entity1 's strong call on the international community to take the initiative in writing off @entity1 's debts as part of the @entity41 and the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) initiative " in a view that the country , both in the north and south , have not enough resources to pay these debts			1
" @entity33 also noted the expected decrease of the north 's oil revenues if southerners choose separation , the news agency said			2
according to @entity33 , @entity19 said debt is a joint responsibility of the north and the south " under joint negotiations of the two partners , " the news agency said			0
a representative for @entity62 who is in @entity1 did not release an official response when reached by phone tuesday			2
in a piece written by @entity5 that appears on @entity2 , the 39th @entity6 president said " the @entity6 should resume normal relations with the government in @entity71 and support debt relief for the governments in both the @entity74 " if the referendum succeeds			0
" in addition to the loss of one - third of its geographic area , the economic cost to the @entity74 of losing a large share of current oil revenues will hurt the economy significantly , " @entity5 added			0
meanwhile , voters in @entity1 participated tuesday in the third day of the week - long referendum			2
the south would become a new nation in july if voters choose independence and no other obstacles emerge			1
the referendum was called for in the 2005 peace treaty that ended 22 years of war between a government dominated by @entity94 in the north and black @entity95 and animists in the south			1
that war killed at least 2 million			1
south @entity9 vote , celebrate in @entity100 at one polling station in @entity105 , on the outskirts of the southern capital of @entity0 , some people slept nearby or arrived early monday			1
the reason : so many voters had showed up on sunday that some were turned away			0
@entity109 shuffled to the front of the line with her wooden cane			0
nearly blind , she had to be shown by election officials how to place her thumbprint			0
@entity109 said she was not sure old she is , but she said she is certain how she will vote			0
" for freedom , " she said			0
" i am very happy to vote , it 's my first time , i am old and i ca n't see much , but i voted for my children			0
" but tuesday 's voting follows several days of violence that flared up in a disputed region between north and south			2
at least 23 people have been killed in ongoing clashes around the disputed region of @entity125 , an oil - rich area that the @entity127 transferred to @entity1 in 1905			1
a 2005 peace agreement called for people in @entity125 to vote this week on whether to remain part of the north or return to the south , but that vote has been delayed			1
clashes have erupted for four days between members of the @entity136 ethnic group , which tend to have more in common with the south , and the @entity137 , a nomadic @entity138 tribe that comes in and out of the @entity125 region and whose sympathies would most likely tilt toward the northern government			0
thirteen of the 23 were @entity137 , according to hospital officials in nearby @entity145			2
ten were reported dead in @entity125 , said @entity146 , secretary general of the @entity125 government			0
@entity146 said monday that he believes the armed militias that clashed with @entity125 government forces were not @entity137 tribesmen , but rather @entity9 government - supported militias			2
he said witnesses described heavy weaponry inconsistent with the automatic weaponry seen carried by @entity137 tribesmen in the past			0
" we believe this is an attempt by the @entity9 government to take @entity125 while the government of south @entity1 forces are busy with the referendum , " @entity146 said			1
observers from around the world are monitoring the historic referendum			0
the @entity166 - based @entity62 has about 70 observers in @entity1 and 30 observers in eight other countries where @entity1 @entity9 are living and voting , according to @entity171 , director of the @entity172 at @entity62			1
representatives of the @entity174 , the @entity175 , the @entity176 and the @entity177 are also observing the referendum			0
southern @entity9 people who lived in the north for decades have crossed back into their homeland to vote in the referendum			1
meanwhile , some voters in the north said they voted for unity , including one woman who said she did n't see a point in splitting up the country			0
prior to the voting , @entity1 @entity9 diplomat @entity190 said a unified @entity9 nation " means only one thing -- it means war			1
" " over the years , unity has imposed war on us , the unity has imposed marginalization on us , the unity has imposed slavery on us , " he said			2
" so , what is the meaning of unity ? for the people of south @entity1 , it means only war			1
" the south has repeatedly accused the north of trying to stoke tension by supporting rebels troops to destabilize the south , an allegation the @entity94 - led government in @entity71 denies			0
even with a secession vote , stumbling blocks could remain -- about 20 % of the border area has not been demarcated , and the division of oil revenues between the two sides could be an issue			0
@entity2 's @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report from @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity2 's @entity225 from @entity71 , @entity1 and journalist @entity226 from @entity227 , @entity1 .			2
