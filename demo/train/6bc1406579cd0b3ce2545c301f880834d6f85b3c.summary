@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity5 are losing faith that the government will protect them from attacks by @entity10 extremists and will " respond appropriately " to future killings , the country 's leading church group warned wednesday			1

" the group also criticized its @entity23 counterparts for failing to condemn the @entity10 militants blamed for sunday 's attacks , calling their responses " unacceptable			1
" " the @entity12 community is fast losing confidence in government 's ability to protect our rights to religious liberties and life , " its president , @entity28 pastor @entity27 , said in the statement			1
