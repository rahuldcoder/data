-- @entity1 is known as " the @entity2 , " the jeweler to the stars whose dazzling creations are worn by the likes of @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
but although he might be regularly rubbing shoulders with @entity13 superstars , famous musicians and elite athletes today , there was a time when the @entity18 - born designer could only dream about approaching a celebrity			1
more than two decades ago , @entity20 used to hang outside five star hotels and trendy bars in @entity23 in the hope of showing his designs to a potential star client			1
" i had my little coach bag , " remembers @entity1			2
" i had everything in it ' cause seriously i did n't know any of these guys			0
so walking up to them you really have just a minute -- if even that -- to say ' yo , this is what i 've got , ' " he adds			0
" i had instances where people thought i was selling hot items -- ' this dude out here man , he 's got some stolen stuff			0
' " read this : @entity46 's first design museum but after a year of frequenting celeb hotspots , exhausting his savings in the process , @entity48 's big break finally came following an @entity23 - based encounter with @entity54 , the @entity55 star playing for the @entity56 at the time			2
" i was just hanging out at a hotel waiting for him because i knew he was going to be there , " remembers @entity1			2
" and when he came down , the press rush that he had , he would have been justified in saying , ' hey man get out of my way			0
" instead , @entity54 invited @entity20 to go later that year to a charity event in @entity66 and show him his creations			1
there was only one problem : @entity20 had no money			2
@entity71 , @entity20 decided to max out his credit card and buy an airline ticket to @entity66 , even though he could n't afford a return flight to @entity23 but when he got to @entity76 , @entity54 was so impressed with his designs that he immediately placed a $ 50,000 order , buying a platinum basketball pendant for himself and other jewelry for his friends			2
" that sale transformed my life , " says @entity1			2
" not only did i pay for the flight ticket , i had enough to start building and doing a bunch of my own collection			0
" ' leap of faith ' the son of a successful @entity18 businessman , @entity20 grew up in the @entity94 country 's @entity92 region			1
his father wanted him to go into the family oil business , but instead @entity1 left @entity18 aged 18 to go to college in the @entity99			1
but while working on getting his education , @entity20 had also to find a way of supporting himself			2
his first job was flipping burgers in a fast - food restaurant overnight			0
read this : tribal beauty of vanishing life " i would work from 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and then i 'll go home , get a couple of hours nap and then go to school at nine , " recalls @entity1			2
" i was at school from 9 until about 4 pm -- and then i went home , got ready and repeated that again , five days a week			0
" after graduating from college , @entity20 tried his luck briefly as an actor and singer , before making his foray into jewelry with the help of a friend whose father was a jeweler			1
starting from the bottom , @entity1 worked his way up , learning the craft and understanding everything about gold , diamonds and other colored gem stones			0
after six years of apprenticing under his friend 's father , @entity20 had managed to save $ 5,000			0
he then decided it was time to strike out on his own and form his own company			0
" it was a leap of faith and i took that leap of faith , " says @entity1			0
" i was very confident in my faith because i believe whatever it is that puts the inspiration in your mind has within it its own fulfillment			0
" ' massive wealth ' since then , @entity20 has managed to build a thriving company whose a-list clientele is a roll call of cinema and music superstars			1
in 2004 , @entity20 made fashion history when he became the first jeweler to stage a runway show at @entity155			1
his sparkling creations include a diamond encrusted cuff -- priced at $ 1.7 million -- and a $ 500,000 diamond - coated guitar for hip - hop artist @entity159			1
but even though he mixes with the rich and famous , @entity20 has not forgotten where he came from			1
he frequently visits @entity18 and is optimistic about the future of both his country and his continent			0
" i think there is going to be a time when @entity46 , starting with @entity18 , becomes the envy of luxury market , " he says			1
" there 's massive wealth here but the @entity174 impression of @entity46 has always been a country of people in need of charity , in need of aid , but @entity46 really is the last frontier			1
" @entity20 also believes that people in the continent should support local designers and luxury brands , which in turn can speed up the growth of @entity94 businesses			1
" we have to embrace our own so that the next @entity188 or @entity189 comes out of @entity46			0
so we are positioning ourselves to be that breakout brand from @entity46			0

@entity1 is a famous jeweler whose a-list clients include movie and music stars
born and raised in @entity18 , @entity20 moved to the @entity99 at a young age to follow his dreams
his sparkling creations have earned him the title , " @entity2 "
