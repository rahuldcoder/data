-- @entity2 organizers in the @entity3 suffered a setback friday when workers at the @entity7 plant in @entity8 , @entity9 , voted against being represented by the @entity10			1
the vote was 712 against the union and 626 in favor			1
there are about 1,550 hourly workers at the plant who were eligible to vote			2
the vote was seen as the @entity10 's best chance to organize a nonunion auto plant , because @entity7 management did not oppose the effort			1
" we commend @entity7 for ... trying to provide an atmosphere of freedom to make a decision , " said @entity24 8 director @entity23 , who directs the union 's @entity3 organizing			1
" unfortunately , politically motivated third parties threatened the economic future of this facility			0
" organizers faced strong opposition by @entity37 officials who wanted to maintain @entity9 's reputation as a non-union state in order to attract new businesses			1
@entity43 senator @entity42 , a @entity37 and former mayor of @entity8 , praised the ' no ' vote			1
" needless to say , i am thrilled for the employees at @entity7 and for our community and its future , " @entity42 said in a statement on his website			1
@entity42 had been heavily involved in negotiations with @entity7 that lead the automaker to pick the town for its factory , according to the senator 's website			1
the plant , which opened in 2011 , is @entity7 's only @entity43 plant			1
but automakers from @entity59 and @entity60 have opened more than 30 @entity43 plants to serve the @entity43 market , and more than two - thirds of those plants are in the @entity3			2
@entity7 said it was neutral on the vote , but opponents of the union had also criticized the company for being too welcoming of the union organizing effort			1
@entity7 wants to establish a so - called " works council " at the plant , in which management and hourly workers together come up with ways to make the plant 's operations more efficient			2
the automaker has works councils at virtually every plant it operates around the world			0
but there were doubts about whether the council could be set up under @entity43 labor law without a union being in place			0
@entity7 said it will try to move ahead with a works council , despite the outcome of the vote			1
" our employees have not made a decision that they are against a works council			0
throughout this process , we found great enthusiasm for the idea , " said @entity95 , ceo of @entity96			0
" our goal continues to be to determine the best method for establishing a works council in accordance with the requirements of @entity43 labor law			0
" @entity2 opponents blame the @entity10 for problems at @entity43 automakers , two of which , @entity108 and @entity109 , needed federal bailouts and bankruptcy reorganization in 2009			0
but @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity113 , the other @entity10 - represented automaker , are all posting strong profits today			0
workers at the @entity7 plant make roughly $ 19 an hour , compared with about $ 26 to $ 28 an hour for veteran hourly workers at the @entity119 automakers , although new hires at the unionized plants are making closer to $ 17			2
but unionized workers are usually better paid than their non-union counterparts			0
@entity125 statistics show that the typical weekly wage of a unionized worker in the private sector is $ 892 a week , or a little more than $ 46,000 a year			0
that 's 20 % more than their nonunion counterparts			0
experts suggested that this loss is a serious blow to the @entity10 's efforts to reverse the long - term decline in its membership			0
" this is a setback that will resonate throughout the @entity3 and , likely , around the world , " said @entity138 , executive editorial director at @entity139			1
" in @entity7 the union had management that seemed neutral to positive toward its attempt to organize the plant 's workers , and it still failed to gain certification			1
the @entity10 's attempts to organize other nonunion plants are very unlikely to be greeted with as much cooperation from other manufacturers , so this could mark the end to @entity10 hopes to gain traction in these nonunion @entity3 state plants			2
" as far as @entity7 's hope to have a works council , that will be difficult to set up anytime soon , according to @entity160 , a management - side labor lawyer with @entity162			2
there ca n't be another union representation election at the plant for at least a year and @entity43 labor law has significant barriers to these kinds of labor - management committees without an independent union			0
" it will be virtually impossible for them to replicate the kinds of council they have in @entity176 , " he said .			0
