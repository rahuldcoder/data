-- a federal agent 's attempt to write a book with an insider 's account of " @entity7 " is being blocked by superiors because it could have " a negative impact on morale , " the @entity1 said			1
@entity11 , an agent with the @entity12 , was among several agents who claimed whistleblower status in order to provide information to @entity17 about the agency			1
the controversial program allowed 2,000 guns to cross @entity22 's border with @entity23 beginning in 2009 with the intention of tracking them to criminal gangs			0
authorities lost track of hundreds of weapons that wound up in the hands of drug cartels and two guns wound up at the scene of a border agent 's slaying the next year although it was not clear whether they factored in the death			0
" @entity7 " was shut down in 2011 and was the subject of congressional hearings and investigations			0
@entity11 wrote a manuscript of his experience and prepared to seek a publisher , the @entity1 said in a letter on monday to the @entity12			2
but his efforts were blocked by agency supervisors , who have oversight on any outside employment by agents , the @entity1 said in the letter protesting the restriction			0
@entity1 lawyers said the @entity12 's actions on @entity11 's publication request are an unconstitutional censorship of his freedom of speech			1
" the reasons provided to agent @entity11 were predictions of ' a negative impact on morale ' in his field division at @entity62 , and ' a detrimental effect [ sic ] on [ @entity12 ] relationships ' with other agencies , the @entity63 and the @entity64 , the @entity1 said in the letter			1
the lawyers said the @entity12 should revisit its decision and change its policies allowing supervisors to block the speech rights of employees for any reason			0
the " @entity7 " operation gave rise to more than a year of political controversy for the @entity78 , and eventually to @entity79 to sanction attorney general @entity80 for contempt of @entity17 in a legal dispute over the @entity84 's refusal to turn over documents			1
@entity80 has said the tactics used in " @entity7 , " which allowed weapons to fall into the hands of traffickers , should never have been allowed			0
@entity11 has claimed that @entity78 officials retaliated against him for providing testimony to @entity17			2
" given the national attention to both the " @entity7 " operation and @entity12 practices more broadly , @entity12 faces an extremely high burden in demonstrating that its interests outweigh agent @entity11 's right to speak and the public 's right to hear his views about ' @entity7 , ' " the @entity1 lawyers said in their letter which was written on @entity11 's behalf			1
in response , an @entity12 spokesman cited federal regulations that prohibit individuals from " writing about issues that arise from his or her duties as a special agent and profiting from his or her experiences while still acting in the special agent capacity			2
