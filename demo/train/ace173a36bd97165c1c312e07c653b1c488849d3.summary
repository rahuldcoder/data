a man suspected of involvement in the september attack on the @entity4 diplomatic compound in @entity5 is being held in @entity6 , according to two sources who have spoken with @entity8			1
both sources confirmed the man 's name as @entity12 ( also spelled @entity13 )			2
one of the sources , who has been briefed on the arrest by @entity17 intelligence officials , said @entity12 was detained within the past two days and had recently returned from a trip to @entity19			1
a @entity6 source also confirmed that @entity12 was in custody in the north @entity23 nation			1
the @entity24 was given direct access to him , and it interviewed him recently in the presence of @entity6 authorities , according to the @entity6 source			1
the @entity6 government allowed one or more members of the @entity4 law enforcement agency to question the man -- something that is not necessarily done when a person is detained in a foreign country -- around the time on wednesday when its prime minister , @entity36 , met with @entity4 president @entity37			1
the @entity4 has been pressing @entity6 authorities on the @entity5 investigation , with fbi director @entity39 traveling to @entity40 in january for talks on the case			1
it is unclear exactly what @entity12 's role might have been or whether he was present at the @entity4 compound at the time of the attack			1
it 's also unclear whether his detention is likely to lead to charges in connection with the assault on the compound , which resulted in the deaths of four @entity4 , including @entity4 ambassador to @entity6 @entity56			1
rep. @entity57 , a @entity59 @entity58 and a member of the @entity61 , said thursday that " we think there are more than a dozen people involved in this			0
" " the idea that potentially we have somebody ... it 's obviously positive news , " @entity57 told @entity8			0
" ... this is the most positive development i 've seen in the past six months			0
" @entity69 is the only known suspect in custody in connection with the attack in @entity5			0
a 26 - year - old @entity73 , @entity74 , was held in @entity75 for several weeks in connection with the assault on the compound after being extradited from @entity79			0
but he was released by a @entity73 judge in january on grounds on insufficient evidence			0
and in december , a @entity4 official with direct knowledge of the investigation said authorities were examining whether the alleged leader of a post-revolution terrorist network in @entity90 had played a role in the september 11 attack			1
@entity93 was released from jail after the downfall of @entity90 president @entity96 and is believed to be the driving force behind a new militant group , according to two @entity4 officials			2
he is currently reported to be in prison in @entity90 after being arrested in december , when police raided an apartment allegedly being used by a jihadist group active in @entity104			0
an associate of @entity93 's subsequently said that he had not been in @entity5 or anywhere in @entity6 on the day of the attack on the compound			2
@entity69 comes from a town called @entity110 , about 50 miles ( 80 kilometers ) from @entity5			0
he was a member of the @entity111 , a militant organization that tried to overthrow the @entity113 regime in the mid- 1990s			0
in 2004 , the @entity6 government reported @entity12 to the @entity115 as on its " wanted " list and issued an @entity117 " seeking his arrest			1
it was the second warrant issued by the @entity113 regime for @entity12 's arrest			1
in 1998 , he was named with two other @entity6 as allegedly involved in the murder of a @entity123 counterintelligence official , @entity124 , and his wife , @entity125 , who were killed in the @entity6 town of @entity127 in 1994			2
the @entity6 authorities also issued an arrest warrant for @entity130 in connection with the crime			1
investigators have learned that he has had contact with the @entity137 - based @entity139 and @entity140 members in @entity19 , sources said			2
however , some analysts have cast doubt on the @entity113 regime 's assertion that @entity6 @entity111 members carried out the attack on the @entity123 couple			2
jihadist groups are strong to this day between @entity5 and the town of @entity150 to the east , an area that includes @entity153			0
several groups are thought to have camps in the @entity156 between @entity153 and towns along the coast			0
@entity4 investigators have identified at least 15 individuals whom " we 're taking a serious look at , " a @entity4 law enforcement official said in january , indicating that some of them were identified on video of the assault			0
ultimately , the official said at the time , " we will get indictments , but it 's not possible to put a timetable on it			0

@entity6 let the @entity24 interview @entity175 face to face , a @entity6 source says
he was detained in the last two days after returning from @entity19 , a source says
authorities do *n't* know his involvement in the attack that left 4 @entity4 dead
@entity6 's government issued an @entity117 " seeking @entity12 's arrest in 2004
