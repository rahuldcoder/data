there is something about the connection between the three of them that nothing can tear apart			0
if baseball on the radio sounds a little different lately , there is a reason			1
@entity13 of the @entity14 reported recently on the proliferation of " drop - in " advertisements on radio broadcasts of ballgames around the nation			1
drop - in ads are paid commercials that air not as traditional advertisements , but as part of the play - by - play			1
the first walk during a @entity28 game is accompanied by " just walk into @entity30 's six convenient locations " ; the first run scored in a @entity33 game is described by the play - by - play man as " the @entity35			1
" it should n't be surprising that this is happening			0
@entity1 has always been a relentlessly and unapologetically revenue - seeking enterprise			2
have you ever seen photos of the outfield walls in big - league ballparks in the early to mid- 20th century ? even @entity44 's marketing strategists would have been envious of the do n't - waste - an - inch commercial clutter			1
broadcast entities have to find a way to make back the money they spend for radio rights			2
according to @entity53 the average salary of a @entity1 player this year -- the average salary -- is around $ 3.6 million , and everything from ticket fees to concession - stand prices is reflective of the sport 's runaway inflation			1
so no one should be startled by the presence of the drop - in radio ads. yes , they frequently can be an irritant to the flow of the play - by - play			1
but ours is a sponsor - and - advertising - driven culture overall ; that 's not going to go away			1
and baseball on the radio -- distinct even from baseball itself -- is durable and steady in ways that ca n't be easily spoiled			1
baseball on the radio is one part of the sport that somehow , despite everything , still manages to feel good			1
on the radio , baseball is less literal than baseball on television			1
with the measured voices of the most skilled announcers accompanied by the resonant humming undertone of the crowd , the echo from down on the diamond of the crack of a bat against a fastball , and the occasional thump of a foul ball bouncing off the top of the play - by - play booth , there is a kind of romance in a radio broadcast			1
the sports - page and sports - website coverage of the business of baseball may , of necessity , be dismaying and ugly lately			1
a visit to the ballpark in person brings on the sticker - shock of those prices on everything from hot dogs to souvenirs to parking spots			2
baseball on the radio , though , remains free			1
unlike viewers of cable tv or subscribers to satellite radio , fans of home - team games on their hometown radio stations do n't have to pay a cent to listen			1
the sound of it all is very much what the sound has been forever			0
because the pace of the game is leisurely , local play - by - play announcers , over a 162 - game season , develop a relationship with their listeners unique in sports			1
they have to talk a lot , even when there 's not much going on down on the field , and the audience grows accustomed to , and comfortable with , their relaxed voices and their heard - but - not - seen personalities			1
and that 's just during routine games			2
at certain moments , radio broadcasts of ballgames can become part of the very fabric of a town -- the authentication of how sports can help define the meaning of community			1
how good can it get ? for a gold - standard example from the history of the sport and of the medium , listen to the @entity159 radio broadcast of @entity164 's final at - bat for the @entity161 before his retirement			1
the date was september 29 , 1963 , at the old @entity166 in @entity161			0
on the play - by - play was @entity168 , in the years before he moved to @entity169 to broadcast the @entity170 and then the @entity171			1
some older residents of @entity161 recall a television simulcast of @entity168 's call , but it is the @entity159 radio version that is indelible in their memories : " here 's @entity164			1
listen to the crowd again			0
" ( the roar is heard behind @entity168 's voice			2
) " a base hit would give the @entity161 the lead			0
" ( the noise sustains			0
oh , what a cut he had , and he fouled it back			0
hey , he really had a swing at that one			0
" ( the crowd begins to clap rhythmically in unison			0
) ... " the stretch by @entity191			0
" and then , unforgettably , from @entity168 : " take a good look , fans			0
... take a good look			0
this might be the last time at bat in the major leagues			2
remember the stance ... and the swing			0
" ( the rhythmic clapping in the stands grows more insistent			0
) " you 're not likely to see his likes again			0
" the procession of the game : " fast ball , low and away			0
" and soon : " the pitch to @entity164			1
" ( @entity168 's voice rises to be heard above the mounting crowd noise			2
) " a hot shot on the ground into right field , a base hit ! ... the @entity161 lead , one to nothing , listen to the crowd ! listen to the crowd ! let 's see , now ! manager @entity220 is talking to @entity221			2
" @entity164 is at first base			1
he might be waiting for this applause on the hit to die down			0
... they 'll tear the joint apart when he trots off the field			0
@entity221 is going to replace @entity164			1
... there he goes ! the end of a great career			0
a standing ovation for @entity164			2
... " could being in the stands have been any more memorable than listening to that ? i remember talking once with a woman in her 80s			0
she was residing in an assisted - living facility ; her husband had died the year before , and the end of their lifetime of long conversations in the evenings had left a void			2
she told me that , even though she had never been much of a baseball fan , she found herself tuning in , each evening , to the strong - signal @entity248 out of @entity249			2
for three hours , she said , she would listen to @entity250 and @entity251 broadcast the @entity253 ' games			0
their voices -- reliable , unhurried -- became her companions			0
a part of life she could count on			0
" take a good look , fans			0
... take a good look			0
" it 's possible , on summer nights , to see most clearly with your eyes closed			2
