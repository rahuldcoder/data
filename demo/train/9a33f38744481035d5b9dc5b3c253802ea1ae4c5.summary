ideally , @entity0 would be spending @entity1 relaxing and eating dinner with her boyfriend and his family			1
instead , the part - time @entity6 employee and substitute teacher will work next thursday night during the early kickoff of the big - box retailer 's @entity10 sale			1
stores will open at 9 p.m. on @entity1 this year , reflecting a wider shift in the retail industry toward getting a head start on the biggest shopping day of the year			1
@entity18 workers plan @entity10 walkout as it stands now , @entity20 , @entity18 , @entity21 and @entity22 will be the first large retail chains to open their doors for bargain hunters at 8 p.m. many other chains are open @entity27 , but their @entity10 sales do n't start until midnight or friday morning			1
@entity29 , who lives in @entity31 , @entity32 , is scheduled to work wednesday from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. she 'll return @entity27 before 9 p.m. and work until 5:15 on friday morning			1
she has to sleep at some point , so traveling 45 minutes each way for @entity1 dinner is out			2
" it should n't have to be a rushed affair , slipping in to eat some turkey and taking a piece of pie for the road , " said @entity29 , who plans to have dinner at home with her boyfriend before going to work			0
what 's your @entity10 strategy ? she likes working for @entity6 , which is why she has stayed with the company for six years , even after relocating from the @entity54 in 2011 , she said			1
she is also grateful to have a job that pays time and a half plus bonus pay for overnight hours , even if it means she ca n't fly home to her own family for the holidays			1
but after watching @entity10 sales start earlier each year , she decided the company had gone too far this time and started a @entity66 petition asking @entity6 ceo @entity67 to forgo the plan to open stores on @entity1			1
" it 's one of few days retail employees get to spend with their families , but at this point there 's no time to see family , " @entity29 said in a phone interview			1
" my main issue is not with people wanting to shop ; they can do that still , though i think that they can hold off until friday without the world crashing down , " she said			0
" my issue is that @entity6 and other retailers have done something they have never done before in opening on @entity1			1
my anger is aimed at the loss of a day that , up until now , was considered important enough for only the most essential services to be open			0
" why it sucks to work @entity10 she 's not the only one who thinks the " @entity10 creep " hurts employees and their families , with some taking action			2
a group of @entity18 workers are planning to strike at about 1,000 stores on @entity10			2
more than 40 petitions have been launched on @entity66 asking retailers including @entity21 , @entity6 , @entity18 and @entity101 's to " give @entity1 back to families			1
" many of them popped up after @entity29 's appeared friday , earning more than 200,000 signatures as of wednesday			0
when it started earning traction , @entity66 promoted the petition among users , but even before then it had taken on a life of its own , site spokeswoman @entity106 said			2
" employees and customers alike are saying , ' @entity1 should be about celebrating with family , not shopping for the latest deals , ' " @entity106 said			1
comments on the petitions echo that sentiment , with some threatening to boycott stores that they say put revenue before employees			0
" i 'm a conscious consumer ; i think of good reasons to shop where i do , and consider why and why not to give any store my money			0
seeing this happen year after year to the employees of @entity6 irks me , and makes me want to ... take my money elsewhere , " one user said			2
other comments in petitions against @entity6 and other retailers focused on the importance of letting employees spend time with family			1
" after 33 years in retail , i still love everything about the holidays ...			0
except telling some poor employee she has to forgo her family holiday because she has to work ! we really have to put a limit on the madness ! " said a person who signed a petition titled , " retailers : stop @entity10			1
" " families should come before retail sales ! give these people the day off that they deserve , " said another person who signed the petition " @entity18 : move @entity152 back to friday			2
" relatives of retail employees are also speaking out			0
the sister of a @entity6 employee in @entity157 started a petition on behalf of her family , claiming that for them , @entity1 will " not be complete " without him			1
" @entity164 has always been important to me and @entity1 is all about family , " @entity162 said in her petition , " @entity6 : do n't take away @entity1			1
" she asked to withhold her last name in deference to her brother , who asked to conceal his identity			0
last year , it was hard for her 24 - year - old brother , who has worked for @entity6 since high school , to relax knowing he had to be at work , she said in an interview with sister network @entity175			2
he rushed through dinner and had to leave for his shift just as everyone was starting to unwind			0
this year , he 's going to miss dinner altogether , she said			0
" it 's just unfortunate that he has to be at work when we 're celebrating , " she said			0
" i get that you sign up for things like this			0
( but ) you do n't typically have to work on @entity1 when you work in retail , and this is something that 's kind of gradually happened			2
" @entity6 and other big - box retailers say they 're responding to consumer demands as best they can -- with employees in mind			1
" @entity6 's opening time was carefully evaluated with our guests , team and the business in mind			1
across the country , team member preferences were considered in creating our store staffing schedules , " said spokeswoman @entity198			0
" @entity1 weekend is one of the busiest of the year , and we appreciate our @entity6 team 's flexibility on this weekend and throughout the holiday season			1
" all hourly employees who work on a national holiday , including @entity1 , receive pay equal to time and a half their hourly pay rate , she said			1
additionally , team members who work certain hours on @entity1 and friday will receive shift differential pay and holiday premium pay			1
@entity18 also was named in several petitions , though most of its stores are open 24 hours and 365 days a year , including @entity1			2
last year , customer traffic was highest during the 10 p.m. hour on @entity1 , a spokesman said " we appreciate our associates for everything they do to serve our customers during this busy shopping season and every day throughout the year , " spokesman @entity217 said in an e-mail			2
" according to the @entity225 , @entity1 night shopping has surged over the past three years			2
most of our stores are open 24 hours and , historically , much of our @entity10 preparations have been done on @entity1 , which is not unusual in the retail industry			1
" ultimately , the power is in the hands of consumers to drive down the demand for extended shopping hours , retail and employment experts agreed			1
@entity237 and @entity238 used to be days of rest , too , said @entity240 , ceo of career network @entity241 , which connects employers and job seekers			0
but now , sales on those days are the norm , showing that over time , society grows accustomed to changes and demands of the free market			0
" this says less about the retailer and more about society as a whole			0
@entity6 , @entity21 , @entity22 and others are all doing what they need to do maximize sales and profits , " he said			0
just as consumers are driving the demand , employees are choosing to work in the field , leaving companies with little choice but to take advantage of every opportunity in the marketplace , said @entity269 with staffing firm @entity270			2
" in today 's economy where jobs are scarce and unemployment is high , people are willing to do more now than they were willing to do two to three years ago			0
this is especially true in retail			0
@entity10 alone last year led to almost $ 12 billion in sales , so you can understand the employers stance on this issue , " he said			0
does this mean that @entity284 and @entity285 shopping is next ? probably not , said @entity286 , associate professor of management at @entity289 's @entity288			0
" i would suggest they are much less at risk because most of the shopping we see at @entity1 is in anticipation of @entity284			2
the incentive for retailers to open on @entity284 and @entity285 's is much lower			0
" @entity29 knows it 's too late to realistically expect @entity6 to change its tune this year			0
but she is hopeful that her petition and others like it will make @entity6 's leadership reconsider opening early for @entity1 next year			1
" going forward i hope it forces @entity6 and other companies to take another look when they realize how many people out there care about this issue , " she said			0
until then , @entity29 plans to be in the electronics section @entity1 night through the morning hours of @entity10			1
" i do value my job and that 's my schedule , " she said			0
" i will definitely honor that , as much as i do n't agree with it			0
