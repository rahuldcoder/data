-- fewer crowds and pleasant weather make autumn a great time to explore @entity3 , but for many @entity5 the destination has suddenly become fraught with worry and potential danger			1
a day after the @entity5 issued a general travel alert for @entity5 in @entity3 amid concerns that @entity10 is planning attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in @entity13 , @entity14 , many travelers may be trying to figure out what to do next			1
still , the alert should scare no one from going to @entity3 , said current and former @entity19 officials -- a sentiment echoed by some travel experts			1
" i do n't think anyone should cancel a trip			1
the chances of something happening to a particular individual are very , very slim , " said @entity25 , president of @entity26 , who just returned from @entity27 , @entity28 , on sunday			1
travel alert issued for @entity5 citizens in @entity3 travel agents said they 've seen limited impact from the alert so far			1
two people with trips booked to @entity27 and @entity39 , @entity40 , have called @entity41 in @entity42 asking what they should do , said @entity44 , senior vice president of leisure sales at the travel agency			1
he was able to offer the worried clients few answers beyond letting them know how much money they might lose if they decide to cancel			2
" that 's all we really can say since it 's a rather nebulous warning , " @entity44 said			0
" i expect more calls			0
nobody has canceled yet ; they 're just questioning , seeing what their options are			0
" there may be few new bookings this week because of the alert , but most travelers with plans already in place likely will not cancel them , said @entity64 , a travel agent who specializes in @entity40 and works for @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67			1
not only do most affluent travelers like to go in september and the first half of october because schools are back in session , but it is a particularly busy time in @entity39 because of fashion week , she added			0
" i 've had one client say , ' @entity75 it 's a little intense right now , ' but i 've certainly have not seen any effect on bookings , " @entity64 said			2
not intimidated @entity5 tourists already in @entity3 are on alert , but many continue to flock to popular landmarks , refusing to be intimidated by the threat			1
@entity84 , who arrived in @entity27 last week from @entity85 to celebrate her birthday , went to see the changing of the guard at @entity89 and said the place was packed			0
she 's also not changing her travel plans			2
" the only thing we 've changed is we 've elected not to go downstairs [ at the hotel ] in the evening to have a drink in the very large lobby bar , " @entity84 said			2
" i do n't believe in allowing terrorists to do what they do , which is to terrorize me			2
if we act terrorized , then they win			0
" because the alert is so vague , travel agents said people should take the same kinds of precautions they always would when traveling : be cautious , stay alert and look for anything suspicious			1
how to protect yourself abroad watch out when you go to a large gathering , added @entity109 , a travel agent who specializes in @entity110 and works for @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113			0
most of her clients avoid the big cities and go to southern @entity110 , where she believes there is little or no threat			0
travelers should also look beyond their activities and sightseeing			0
" just be aware of your surroundings , keep an ear on the international news -- people do n't always do that when they 're traveling , " @entity64 said			0
meanwhile , travel agents are watching and waiting to see what kind of a long - term impact the alert will have			1
" certainly , we 're always worried when something like this happens because it always affects travel			0
there are always going to be people who are going to say , ' i 'm going to put it off , ' " @entity44 said .			0
