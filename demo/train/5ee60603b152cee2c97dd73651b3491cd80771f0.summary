@entity0 , @entity1 -- it seems like a simple question , but ask @entity5 and @entity6 what grade they 're in and you wo n't get a traditional answer			1
at almost any other school in the country , the 11 - year - old friends would be in fifth grade			1
not so at @entity15 in @entity0 , @entity1 , where there are no grades and no grade levels			1
here , children are grouped together in classes based on their ability , not their age in literacy class , @entity5 and @entity6 are both in level seven			1
in math , @entity5 is in level seven while @entity6 is still learning level six			2
" he 's the highest in the class , " said @entity6 , who is proud of her friend 's achievements			0
the move to do away with grade levels throughout the @entity31 began three years ago			2
standards - based learning , as it 's called , is founded on the belief that every child learns in different ways and at different speeds			1
with the school district on an academic watch list , educators here were eager to reverse the slide			1
" every single student is getting an individualized education , " said @entity42 , who helped usher in the reform at her school two years ago			1
" we are giving our kids exactly what they need when they need it			0
" children work at their own level in each subject and must demonstrate proficiency in various learning targets , achieving a score of 75 % or higher before they 're allowed to move on to the next level			2
during a recent visit to @entity63 's literacy class , students ranging in age from 8 to 10 were gathered in small groups or working on their own to hit their learning targets			1
each table had a basket with books separated into four different reading levels			0
@entity70 says when she first heard about standards - based learning , she wondered , " how do you juggle that many levels in one classroom ? " now , she sees the benefits , since students are n't frustrated by work that 's too hard , nor bored with assignments that are too easy			1
" the kids know exactly what they 're working on ... and what they need to do , so it 's very empowering for them , " she said			0
@entity70 's students come to her when they 're ready to take the proficiency test to move to the next level			1
" i do n't know if ' hounding ' is the right word , " @entity70 said , " but they definitely will let you know ... ' please sign me up			0
' " unlike traditional schools , students at @entity42 can move up a learning level anytime they 're ready , not just at the end of the year			1
when a visitor asked who had moved up a level in the 2010 - 11 school year , almost all hands shot up			1
a large bulletin board in the hallway displays the smiling faces of nearly 400 students who had changed levels in the month of march			2
" the time is right for a system that focuses on individual students and lets them progress at their own pace , " said education researcher @entity103 , who is helping the district develop standards - based learning , a system that was first introduced in the 1960s			1
" the conversation around the country is about that like it 's never been before			0
" the @entity119 school district is made up of about 10,000 students , mostly from @entity122 families			1
about 40 % are still learning @entity123			2
in the last decade , as demographics began to change , standardized test scores fell , leading the district to be placed on an academic watch list			1
@entity129 president @entity128 said the district needed something drastic to turn it around			2
she set out to enlist teachers and parents , aware that without their support , the new system would fail			0
high school teachers were among the first to embrace the idea , realizing students would have to have mastered material before moving levels			2
their response , according to @entity156 : " ' you mean , by the time they get to us they 're going to know all ... of the prior material that they should know in biology , in math , in social studies , and i 'm not going to have to spend the first three months of their freshman year figuring out what they do n't know ? ... wow -- absolutely			0
' " parents , however , did have concerns , especially whether there would be a big age range in some classes			2
" we were very quick to say , ' no , we 're not going to have someone with a mustache ... sitting next to a 6 - year - old			2
' that 's just not going to happen , " she said			0
instead , older children at lower levels are given extra help , as they are in traditional middle and high schools			0
standards - based learning in the @entity31 is currently in place in kindergarten through ninth grade , and will be integrated through all high schools by 2014			1
but it 's not for the faint of heart			0
this particular approach was developed by the @entity179 , a nonprofit organization that helped turn around a small , struggling school district in @entity181			2
students there went from 0 % attending college to nearly 90 % going on to secondary education or the military			0
the organization 's executive director , @entity187 , said that in order for standards - based learning to work , schools must have strong leadership and shared vision			1
of the approximately 300 schools that have attempted to enact this system , @entity187 said , half have n't been able to stick with it			0
" superintendents last 2 - 2Â½ years on average in this country			2
it 's really hard to lead systemic change when you have that much turnover , " @entity187 said			0
community and school support are critical , she said , " so when a leader does leave , you have enough shared vision and stakeholder support that they will hold onto this and it wo n't leave , despite the next leader			0
" the message is particularly relevant in @entity31 , where the schools superintendent who brought the change recently resigned			0
and since school board members are are limited to two four - year term limits , the unanimous support may wane if standardized test scores do n't improve			1
so far , they have n't			0
in last years ' @entity223 test , only 39 % of @entity42 ' third - graders tested proficient in reading			1
that 's 8 % lower than the previous year , before the new system was put in place			0
@entity129 president @entity128 explained that it would take three to five years for any type of major reform to show results			0
" so i would say , if within three to five years we 're not seeing the kind of results that we project , yeah , it probably could be at risk , " she said			0
principal @entity42 is quick to point out that the initial drop in test scores was expected , since many kids were placed in lower levels to make up for gaps in their educations			1
" our hope and goal is that when this year 's test scores come out and the following year 's , that progression will just continue to increase , " @entity42 said , adding that test scores do n't paint the whole picture			1
discipline problems , @entity42 said , have decreased 76 % in the past two years -- a sign , she said , that the system is working			0
" when students are challenged exactly where they need to be , " she said , " there 's not a lot of time for students to be messing around in class			0

a @entity1 school switched to standards - based learning
it means students learn according to ability , not their age group
district leaders say it will take 3 - 5 years to improve test scores
