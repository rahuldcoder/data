@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 makes its first passenger flight wednesday , carrying about 250 passengers from @entity6 to @entity0 on @entity8 's @entity7			1
@entity3 has spent years and billions of dollars developing a plane with what it calls " visionary design			1
" as the first customers prepare to fly on the @entity2 , @entity1 looks at what sets the 787 apart from the planes before it			1
it 's plastic ( sort of ) the @entity2 is made of 50 % composite materials , carbon fiber - reinforced polymers that are both lighter and more durable than traditional aluminum			1
composite materials have been used before in passenger planes but never to this extent			2
they comprise both the wings and the fuselage of the 787			0
most of the features listed below could not have been built in an airplane made mostly of traditional aluminum			0
the @entity31 the cabin pressure on the 787 is higher and the humidity higher than other airplanes			1
basically , passengers on board will feel like they are at an altitude of 6,000 feet , 2,000 feet lower than a standard flight			0
the changes will cut down on passenger fatigue , dry eyes and headaches , @entity3 said			1
they are made possible by the new material , which is less prone to corrosion and structural fatigue than traditional aluminum			0
more space @entity3 's chief pilot @entity48 said he believed this is the first feature passengers will notice about the new plane			1
you are " not being squeezed into a tube , " he said			0
" you 'll have a wide open area			0
" there is also more room for overhead luggage			0
fuel efficiency the 787 is 20 % more fuel efficient than similarly - sized aircraft , a change which allows airlines to save money and deploy the plane on longer routes , @entity3 said			1
" on an aircraft of that size , even a slight reduction in fuel burn makes a big difference to overall cost , " said @entity67 , @entity68 at @entity69			1
another plus , according to aviation experts , the longer range will allow carriers to introduce more point - to - point routes , so passengers will have more options and fewer layovers			0
@entity84 @entity48 feels @entity3 has worked hard to make operating the 787 as natural as possible for pilots			1
" the flight deck is laid out so it is very intuitive to operate all the controls , " he said			0
one example : the @entity90 ( @entity91 ) used by pilots is displayed on glass , so they can see the data without having to lose sight of what 's going on outside			0
bigger windows clearly a case where bigger is bigger , the @entity2 has windows that are 19 inches tall and 30 % bigger than the on similarly - sized aircraft			1
say goodbye to those plastic shades as well			0
the @entity2 is the first commercial plane to have electronic dimmers at each seat			2
the flight attendants can also darken or lighten all the shades automatically , so never again will a small child wake up half the plane by deciding to let in a little sunlight			2
uniformity do n't expect much difference from one @entity2 to the next , @entity67 said			2
@entity3 purposely limited the extent that carriers could customize the new plane in order to appeal to banks and leasing companies that are behind many purchases			2
if all the planes are similar , it 's easier to hire them out to airlines or resell if needed .			0
