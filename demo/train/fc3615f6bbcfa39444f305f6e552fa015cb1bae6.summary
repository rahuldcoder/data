-- since the revolution in 1959 @entity1 has been many things to many people , but the collapse of the @entity6 meant few have seen the island state as a vision of the future			1
but that could be changing -- at least in one aspect			0
@entity1 experienced a reordering of its food production in the early 1990 's			1
a boom for organic foods , but problems persist			2
as worries grow in developed nations about a future without plentiful supplies of oil , the communist republic is proving to be an increasingly popular example of how to cope when the spigots run dry , for the simple reason : they 've already been there			1
with the loss of supplies from oil - rich @entity29 in 1991 , and a @entity31 embargo preventing imports from elsewhere , @entity1 was plunged into a severe recession in the early 1990 's , referred to as " the @entity34			1
" suddenly society was faced with dramatically reduced amounts of hydrocarbon energy , and the result was a fundamental reorganization of food production , leading to a boom in urban organic agriculture , which requires fewer inputs than conventional farming			1
despite the increase in organic production , problems remain for @entity1 's agricultural system and ability to feed itself with local produce			1
" some estimates of the amount of food imports in @entity1 go as high as 80 percent of domestic consumption , " says @entity0 's @entity51 , @entity52			1
" this is n't to say that small scale organic farmers could n't learn for isolated growers , but @entity1 's overall agriculture is one of the government 's biggest problems			1
" @entity1 's organic example , however , has been a source for inspiration for many outside of the country , such as the @entity70 - based @entity69 ( @entity69 )			1
" with the collapse of the @entity6 @entity1 was in a position where no - one thought it would survive -- they lost 80 percent of their trade overnight , " says @entity71 of @entity69			2
" as a result the priority given to food changed , and it was immediately seen as much more important			0
" all over @entity82 small - scale organic gardens were started on roof - tops , backyards and in empty parking lots , spreading rapidly to other cities and urban centers			0
@entity89 's markets known as " kiosks " sprang up providing city - dwellers with access to locally - grown fruit and vegetables , cutting the use of oil in transporting food in from the countryside			0
in the countryside , oxen and horses replaced tractors			0
a huge program of land re-distribution was instigated			0
many of the vast collective farms beloved by communist planners started to look inefficient , and so were broken up into units more manageable without fleets of tractors			0
the process is still ongoing			0
in february 2009 the @entity1 authorities announced that 1,827 square miles of state land would be given to @entity1 with agricultural experience or other citizens			1
but this change was n't easy			0
prior to the " @entity34 " @entity1 had been a heavy user of oil - based chemical fertilizers , and much of the land was heavily degraded , requiring years of careful manuring to restore fertility			2
however , despite the obstacles , they did it			0
" i was there in 1992 , which was one of the most difficult years , and certainly people were moaning a lot , but they worked together , they still kept the milk coming for the schoolchildren , " says @entity126			0
" throughout it all they did n't close any hospitals , they did n't close any schools ; they kept going against the odds			0
in many ways they show us what is possible , what a community can achieve when they work together ; the power of co-operation			0
" a blue - print to cope with problems post-peak oil ? of course a powerful authoritarian state and strong central planning made such huge changes easier to implement ; a similar process of development might be very different , and possibly lees successful , in the @entity156			2
but as an increasing number of people believe we will soon face a major social and economic crisis as oil supplies dwindle over coming decades , many believe we have a lot to learn from the @entity1 experience			1
" the industrialized world can learn that its dependency on oil will eventually push it through similar experiences to that which @entity1 had to face in the 1990 's , and with similar outcomes , " says @entity170 , author of " @entity171 and @entity172 in an era of @entity174 : lessons from @entity1			1
" " we can also learn that if we do not have the necessary capacities in place , our food production system will be caught short , as was @entity1			0
" all over the world from @entity181 to the @entity70 members of the @entity183 , which aims to help communities prepare for the twin challenges of peak oil and climate change , hold regular screenings of the film , " @entity195 " , an upbeat documentary that explores the @entity1 experience , alongside films about our oil addiction such as " @entity193 " and " a @entity194			1
" " @entity1 inspires groups overseas wanting to develop alternative , more sustainable farming and food systems , partly based on the myth that has built up around @entity1 being organic , " says @entity198			1
" organic farming in @entity1 only operates in urban areas , not rural ... [ but ] the @entity1 organic movement and the people within it are highly dedicated to their work and will continue to influence and be influenced by the organic movement overseas			1
" the future is less clear			0
new allies are once again opening @entity1 up to the outside world -- and providing fresh oil supplies			2
" @entity213 is supplying @entity1 with increasing quantities of oil and agrochemicals , so @entity1 agriculture -- and here i 'm talking about rural farms which supply 95 percent of the nation 's domestic food needs -- is becoming more industrialized , though it will not revert back to the extreme practices of the @entity6 era , " says @entity198			1
" organic urban agriculture will continue and likely continue to expand out to peri-urban areas			2
" but whatever the years ahead bring , @entity198 believes the experience of the " @entity34 " has left its mark on @entity1 society			2
" the crisis that @entity1 suffered has made it a better place in certain aspects , as people had to become more resilient and self - sufficient and less wasteful , " says @entity198			0
" although @entity1 would certainly say that their food shortages and lack of inputs has been a hardship			2

@entity1 's economic hardship in early 1990 's led to reorganization of agriculture
urban and organic farming implemented plus break up of inefficient large farms
some see @entity1 's experience as way to cope with problems of future oil crises
