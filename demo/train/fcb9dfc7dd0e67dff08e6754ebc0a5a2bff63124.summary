" with this points system and the way races swing one way or another , i am convinced we still have a significant chance , " @entity3 wrote on his @entity4 blog			1
" there are 150 points up for grabs , enough to turn the situation around			0
we must remain calm and concentrate , to try and make up the difference as soon as possible			0
" clearly , there are now three of us who need to make up for ground lost in @entity18			0
it was not the @entity9 @entity8 we were expecting , that 's for sure			2
