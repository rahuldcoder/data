@entity0 -- the recent suicidal violence in @entity3 coincides with a growing concern that president @entity5 might be tempted by the same folly that drove president @entity7 and massively increase the number of @entity10 troops in @entity11 -- by up to 65,000 if he were to listen to some of his military advisers			1
this is a deadly mistake that would drag the @entity10 into a quagmire with even more catastrophic consequences than those it has faced in @entity20			1
the recent comment by @entity22 chief of staff @entity23 to @entity1 that " the @entity7 administration failed to ask critical questions about the war in @entity11 " would be a key point of departure , but the question remains how critically @entity5 is willing to ask these questions			1
the fear that is now principally driving this tendency to escalate the war is that the @entity35 and @entity36 are about to declare victory over yet another superpower , and even expand their theater of operation , as the @entity42 army chief general sir @entity41 has suggested , into other parts of the world			1
this is a phantom fear , from a frightful figment of imagination in which the @entity10 and @entity49 armies are now strategically invested and that has for almost a decade had a crippling effect on any measure of reason and sanity			2
there is no better way to combat this fearful fantasy than rethink what we have collectively come to understand by these two elusive terms " @entity35 " and " @entity36			2
" the only way to defeat these deceptive delusions is not to dispatch tens of thousands of innocent lives across the globe and endanger even more tens of thousands of innocent lives in @entity11 and @entity3 , but to re-examine the terror that these terms have exercised over our mental faculties ever since the traumatic events of 9/11			2
what now passes as " @entity35 " and " @entity36 " fundamentally lack serious popular bases , mass infrastructural support or certainly any coherent ideology			2
in the history of the militant @entity79 ideologies that we have known and examined in detail over the last 200 years , these are conceptual and political aberrations that will wither away almost as soon as they are taken off the radar of @entity10 and @entity86 military operations and , by extension , away from the global limelight			2
the more you fight these delusions , the more powerful they become -- not as facts on the ground , but as figments of the military 's imagination			0
@entity5 would commit perhaps the deadliest mistake and the biggest blunder of his presidency if he were not to listen to the wise counsel of vice president @entity100 , who is reportedly against this massive increase of @entity10 forces in @entity11			1
in a recent interview with @entity105 on @entity1 , president @entity103 of @entity11 sought to dismantle the myth of the @entity35 when he said , " there are thousands of them who are not ideologically our enemies			1
there are thousands of them who do n't hate us or hate our way of life , who are not enemies to @entity10 , who are not enemies to the world , who just want to live in their own country in peace , who are frightened , are intimidated by bad behavior -- from the very beginning -- by some of the people that the coalition employed and by some of the people that the @entity11 government had working on security issues			1
so , we have to bring those elements back to @entity11 who are not part of @entity36 , not part of terrorist networks , and who are accepting the @entity11 @entity143 and who are willing to come back			2
" yet another piece of evidence about the folly of the @entity10 involvement in @entity11 came in the resignation of @entity150 , a foreign service officer and former @entity152 captain who resigned in protest over the @entity11 war			1
" i believe that the people we are fighting there are fighting us because we are occupying them , " @entity150 told @entity1 last week			0
" not for any ideological reasons , not because of any links to @entity36 , not because of any fundamental hatred towards the @entity160			0
the only reason they 're fighting us is because we 're occupying them			0
" the regional consequences of not heeding what vice president @entity100 , @entity23 , @entity103 and @entity150 are saying , implicitly or explicitly , will be even more catastrophic			0
because of the fundamental flaws of the @entity5 administration 's @entity11 strategies so far , exacerbated by the incompetence of the @entity3 political and military apparatus , there is already a massive humanitarian crisis in the @entity174			0
any further increase of the @entity10 military force in @entity11 will talibanize these border areas even further , and with them potentially the rest of the country			1
the @entity35 has never been a unified or a monolithic entity , although for a short period in 2001 , it had tenuous control of @entity11 , and even less so has this thing called " @entity36			1
" at its essence , what is called " @entity35 " in @entity11 is nothing more that a @entity190 tribal push for power , and as such it must be distinguished from what is called " @entity35 " in the @entity194 of @entity3 , which in turn must be separated from the @entity197 - e @entity196 in @entity198 , and all of those from the band of militant adventurists gathered around @entity202 and @entity203 , self - delusional to the point of calling themselves " @entity36 " ( " @entity206 " )			1
the atrocities of 9/11 were the work of a criminal band of militant adventurers , on par with the network of support that someone like @entity215 could muster , and certainly not on a scale that could warrant the cross-continental mobilization of a superpower and its allies			0
the time for conventional military operations , as the @entity222 ought to have learned from @entity223 and @entity224 , is long since over			0
you can not fight and will not win a conventional war halfway around the globe against an amorphous enemy you can scarce clearly identify -- let alone pinpoint and attack , or target and eliminate			0
the @entity231 and its allies are fighting a phantom war in @entity11 , with massive civilian casualties and increasingly ineffective combat strategies			0
@entity5 should not yield to the pressure of the @entity42 and the hawks in @entity238 , and increase the size of the @entity10 military			0
he and his civilian advisers are very wise to take time to examine this critical condition and not fall into the same trap that @entity7 did			0
instead of increasing the size of the @entity231 in @entity11 , there must be a phasing out of the 100,000 - plus @entity10 and @entity86 forces that are already in @entity11 and a corresponding phasing in of massive economic aid to rebuild a country the @entity10 and its @entity49 allies ( the @entity42 in particular ) , and before them the @entity248 , are chiefly responsible for ruining			1
the @entity35 and @entity36 will dissipate like a shadowy shade of a nightmare when the might of the @entity10 military stops actually creating what it wants to destroy , and once the limelight of world media is no longer cast upon the @entity11 mountains			1
the @entity259 to @entity5 could not have been timelier as a way to remind him why he was elected to the @entity22 in the first place			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			0

it would be fatal mistake to boost troop levels in @entity11 , @entity264 says
he says the more you fight the @entity35 , the more *formidable* they appear
he says that in reality , the @entity35 is an amorphous entity that will melt away
@entity264 says @entity10 should invest in development of @entity11 , not troops
