@entity0 , @entity1 -- pastor @entity3 stood before his congregation sunday , prepared for people to shake their fists at @entity7			1
such reactions in the only church in @entity10 , @entity1 , would have been entirely appropriate			1
after all , it was in this rural community -- between @entity13 and @entity0 , along @entity14 530 -- that a mudslide last weekend ravaged the landscape , swallowing homes , killing at least 21 and leaving 30 still missing			1
not a soul in the room , where the pastor guessed 115 gathered , had gone untouched by the horror that rocked their quiet world			1
instead , amid the fear , the unknown and the hurt , the pastor of @entity25 was surprised by what people shared			1
" i was expecting someone to say , ' i lost my brother or i lost my house and i 'm angry ' -- and that would have been ok , " he said by phone sunday			1
" but today what we heard was , ' i was in trouble and a stranger stopped and helped me			2
' " that looking out for each other , the coming together , is just one example of the good that can appear around the corner when tragedy strikes , he said			2
" people say in times of disaster , it brings out the best and the worst in people			2
but i 'm just seeing the best , " he said			2
" i 'm seeing patience and sacrifice			2
i do n't know what the future holds , but i do hope for some unexpected blessings			1
" he 's not alone			2
" we are hoping for a miracle , " @entity1 gov. @entity58 told @entity2 's " @entity61			1
" " we are going to do everything we can to look for that miracle and care for these ( affected ) families			2
" the number of people unaccounted for after the march 22 landslide dropped saturday to 30 from 90 , officials said			1
in addition to the 21 confirmed fatalities , another four bodies have been discovered in the debris field , @entity69 , a program manager for the @entity70 of @entity71 , said sunday evening at a news conference			1
@entity58 said officials would be in an active rescue mode as long as there was any possibility of finding survivors			1
the governor pointed to the deep grief the community feels , but said it also is very resilient and that he is amazed by acts of courage and inspiration by the people involved in search efforts			1
" these people are showing some courage and resolution and they are hanging together too , " he told @entity2			1
" this is a place that is pretty tough			2
" @entity58 said the conditions searchers face are extremely difficult			1
sometimes it takes five minutes just to go 50 feet , he said			2
emergency management officials had said all week they expected the number of people unaccounted for would drop dramatically as residents of @entity0 and nearby @entity10 turned up			2
" we expected that number to drop in part due to a combination of finding people who registered as safe and well , and cross-referencing the list with confirmed identities of victims at the ( medical examiner 's ) office , " @entity69 said			0
@entity69 said the challenge of identifying victims is becoming more complicated as search operations continue			0
" the slide hit with such force that the rescuers are not finding full , intact bodies , " he said			0
volunteers are also collecting family mementos from the debris so they can be cleaned and returned to their owners			0
residents unite to help victims remembering the dead on saturday , residents and rescuers paused in the rain at 10:37 a.m. , the exact time when a landslide forever changed their world a week earlier			1
that 's when the mountain - size torrent of mud swept over a mile , knocking over homes and trees			0
in saturday 's moment of silence , officials eulogized the rural residents who lost their lives inside their homes or on the road when the hillside collapsed , after a month of ground - soaking rain , and obliterated everything in its path			1
" our community is changed forevermore , " @entity0 mayor @entity148 told 40 people outside the fire station , where the flag fluttered at half - staff			0
" it 's going to take a long time to heal			0
" indeed , even rescue crews at the disaster zone stopped work in the mud and observed the short vigil , said @entity161 , a @entity70 fire battalion chief			0
dogs join search meanwhile , rescuers brought in more dogs -- both rescue and cadaver canines -- last week to search for buried survivors or bodies			1
many of those dogs were rested on sunday			1
noting the stark reality of the ongoing search , @entity148 said that saturday 's standstill of 30 seconds " is all the rest we 're going to get			1
" " in our minds , we are in recovery mode			0
in our hearts , we are still in rescue mode , " he added			0
at groceries , pharmacies and community centers in @entity70 , residents stopped what they were doing and held the momentary vigil on a gray day that obscured the mountaintops			0
about eight miles down the @entity190 of the @entity191 from @entity10 -- where the landslide occurred -- a store cashier bowed his head in silence			1
outside his @entity196 in @entity13 , shoppers also stopped , huddled around a cart , and looked solemnly at the ground			0
after 20 seconds of silence , the shopping resumed			0
back at @entity0 , about 15 miles from @entity10 , residents used saturday 's solemnity to recall what they were doing when the massive hillside came crashing down			1
@entity148 was at a hardware store to buy screws for a weekend project			0
then the credit card machines went down			0
then came word of the landslide , with a home in its path			1
pastor @entity213 was having coffee with the local barber in his shop at the time			1
" a woman came through the door and asked for a cell phone			0
she wanted to make a call			0
she said , ' i was following a car and a slide pushed it off the road , ' " @entity213 recounted			0
that 's how locals began to learn of the catastrophe 60 miles northeast of @entity229			2
watching the water and weather while rescuers labored in the rain and slogged through mud saturday and sunday , officials said they were concerned about flooding in the nearby waterway			2
@entity237 , a spokeswoman for the state @entity239 who gave updates sunday on the effort on the eastern side of the slide , said the river had risen about 1 foot over the weekend			2
and , she said , a secondary road to the mudslide area was constructed to offer safer access for search crews			0
meanwhile , ponds , too large to drain , formed in the debris field , said @entity69 of the @entity252			0
the wet conditions have only made a difficult task that much harder			0
a break from the wet conditions , though , may finally be in the forecast			0
mostly sunny skies are predicted in the days ahead			0
how to help @entity2 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 contributed from @entity1			1
@entity262 , @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 also contributed to this report			0
@entity270 and @entity271 in @entity272 reported and wrote .			0
