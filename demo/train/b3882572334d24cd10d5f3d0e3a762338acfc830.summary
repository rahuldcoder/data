@entity0 -- members of @entity3 are quick to say they support the troops and veterans , but the number of elected officials who have served has plummeted to its lowest point since @entity9 only 20 % of the 535 members of the new @entity3 have served in the military , 25 from the @entity12 and 90 from the @entity13			1
juxtapose that with 1975 , when over 70 % of those elected had served in the armed forces			1
@entity18 data on veterans serving is difficult to find , according to the @entity20			0
with the nation currently facing two wars , one group worries about the effects the dwindling numbers may have on defense decisions			0
" it 's not always that veterans care more about defense issues , but those politicians who have served in the military understand to a much greater degree what they are voting on , " said @entity27 , executive director of @entity28 , a group that trains veterans to run for public office			1
" having members in @entity3 with military experience is crucial to effective civilian control of the military , " @entity27 added			1
today , some of the most prominent voices on military , foreign affairs and veterans issues are themselves veterans			2
among them are @entity47 vets sen. @entity48 , @entity49 , who was a prisoner of war for more than five years ; sen. @entity51 , @entity52 ; and sen. @entity53 , @entity54			0
sen. @entity55 , @entity56 , is currently in the @entity57 and sen. @entity58 , @entity60 - @entity59 , is in the @entity61			0
rep. @entity62 , @entity63 , is a veteran of the @entity65 and @entity66 wars			0
despite the continuous drop in the number of veterans elected to @entity3 , funding for veterans ' issues have not taken a hit			1
the @entity74 budget went up 16 % in 2010 , the largest single - year increase in over 30 years according to the department			0
the defense budget has also grown considerably in the last decade			0
" over the past four years , @entity3 has elevated priorities and expanded benefits and services to all @entity85 veterans to the highest levels in quality and funding in our country 's history , " said sen. @entity78 , @entity79 , chairman of the @entity80			1
" i believe that @entity3 will continue to hold veterans ' issues and needs at the forefront even with a reduction of congressional members who are veterans			1
" a government expert who studies @entity3 said a concern like @entity27 's dates back to the country 's founding fathers			2
" what this reflects is a classic debate of descriptive representation , meaning do i need a person that is a member of my group to adequately represent my views in @entity3 , " said @entity103 , an associate professor at @entity104			2
@entity103 believes where this matters most is in a party 's ability to sway public opinion and gain credibility on its proposals , for example , the opinion of a doctor serving in @entity3 on the health care debate may hold more weight with the public			0
president @entity127 's top military adviser voiced concerns recently about what he sees as a disconnect between the civilian and military worlds , claiming most @entity85 know " precious little " about the military and the military needs to work harder to justify itself to the public			1
" to the degree we are out of touch , i believe it is a very dangerous force , " @entity138 chairman adm. @entity137 said at a conference on military professionalism last week			0
the drop of veterans in @entity3 may be attributed in part to the end of the draft system in 1973 , according to the @entity150 , but @entity27 's group says there is more to the drop off than just a decline in the number of vets in the population " the cost of running a campaign has skyrocketed , especially with the need to buy tv commercials , and that creates a barrier of entry to people coming out of the military ( who ) do n't have the financial ability that others in different professions have , " said @entity27 , whose group is trying turn the decline around			1
the group also claims that the increased partisanship in @entity3 is a turnoff for vets			0
" military members have served overseas and seen that the enemy is the guy at the end of the battlefield , not the guy on the other end of the aisle , " said @entity27 .			2
