-- @entity1 and @entity2 made the headlines last week on the news that they are offering coverage for their female employees to freeze their eggs			1
financial support for egg - freezing represents a bold step by these tech leaders , intended to support women as they manage the modern - day conflict between work and family			1
it is also the latest incarnation of technological optimism , a belief in quick fixes for complex social , political and cultural issues			1
but women and men everywhere should be suspicious of egg - freezing as a " solution			1
" egg - freezing has its history in a century of experiments applying cold to reproductive cells to maximize productivity			2
cattle breeders in the mid- 1900s began freezing bull semen so they could impregnate many cows all at once by the same bull			2
in this way they could standardize and control conception to generate the highest profits			0
the techniques developed in agriculture traveled to fertility clinics , and today a similar logic prevails in human sperm banks			0
as commentators have been quick to point out , human egg - freezing is a new technology that carries bodily risk and high rates of failure			1
to stockpile eggs in the freezer , women self - inject powerful hormones for several weeks before undergoing outpatient surgery			1
in the short term , women face risks from the drugs and egg retrieval procedure			0
as for the long term , there are zero longitudinal studies on the health effects of exposing women 's bodies to fertility medications			1
and because of high failure rates , even if women go through all this trouble , fewer than 3 in 10 will end up with a baby			0
but even if the technology were perfect , the proposal to help women put motherhood on ice so they can focus on their jobs is shortsighted			0
historically , the relationship between technology and women 's work has been complicated			1
for example , as @entity79 argued in the classic " more work for @entity81 , " the introduction of household technologies like the vacuum cleaner added to women 's workload by raising standards of cleanliness to new heights			1
egg - freezing is a technological response to a situation that results from an earlier pharmaceutical fix for work - life balance : the birth control pill			2
as the historian @entity96 documents , women used the pill to delay childbearing and enter the workforce			0
but when women initiate families later in life , they can have difficulty conceiving			0
the pill helped contribute to the current situation in which birth control and children are seen as a woman 's choice and responsibility -- and men , employers and governments need not adapt			2
new corporate policies supporting egg - freezing replicate this problem			2
indeed , the structural organization of work has proved more inflexible than women 's ovaries			2
at the beginning of the @entity122 , when wage labor was being regularized , workers were compelled ( sometimes via force and sometimes via incentives ) to show up on time and to order their lives along the expectations of their employers			0
the tech industry has reconfigured the places and even the hours that people work , but it still sets a very demanding pace			0
what 's more , women now constitute almost half of all workers			2
and rather than making fundamental changes to the structure of work in our society to accommodate women 's reproductive years , technological optimists reach for an engineering solution			2
have a conflict between women 's biological clock and work productivity ? freeze the eggs			1
instead , the goal should be to build systems of production that allow us to live our lives without constantly watching the clock			0
for example , @entity158 political scientist @entity157 has proposed aligning the work day with the school day			0
to be sure , men also feel pulled by the competing demands of work and family , and there is growing scientific evidence that they too have biological clocks			0
a recent study published in the journal @entity171 demonstrated that with every passing year , men 's sperm is more likely to contain harmful genetic mutations that contribute to their children 's risk of autism and schizophrenia			0
will @entity1 and @entity2 suggest to their male employees that they freeze sperm in order to postpone fatherhood ? freezing eggs appears to make reproduction controllable , but one can not freeze time			1
even if cells can be hoarded and stored , time can not			0
time and life and bodies march on ; we age , even if our reproductive materials are transformed into frozen assets			0
egg - freezing may be an optimal choice for some women , but it is not a solution to the overwhelming pressures that result from companies requiring long work hours and constant availability			1
instead , we must demand policies that have been demonstrated to alleviate the strain for mothers and fathers alike : a living wage , reasonable work hours , paid parental leave , and child care			1
freezing eggs simply defers the pressures of today to tomorrow .			1

**writers** : @entity1 , @entity2 offer coverage for women employees freezing their eggs
it 's quick fix for tricky social , cultural issues -- do *n't* *buy* it , they say
they say the policy expects women to be flexible , not companies
**writers** : instead , demand policies that ease the workplace strain for mothers , fathers
