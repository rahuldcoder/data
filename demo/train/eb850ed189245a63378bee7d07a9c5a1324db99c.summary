editor 's note : on @entity5 's " @entity4 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity2 goes outside the @entity6 to report on issues affecting communities across the country			1
pope @entity10 tells @entity5 's @entity2 that a lot of farms are hurting because of the global recession			1
@entity14 , @entity15 ( @entity5 ) -- @entity16 is tucked into the rolling hillsides of @entity15 's legendary bluegrass country			1
@entity19 and @entity20 are among the stallions critical to the reputation -- and the bottom line -- of the @entity10 family business			2
and just how do the stallions prove their value ? " when their progeny does well on the race track , " pope @entity10 said			2
" ca n't bluff that			2
that 's when they prove what they are worth			1
" pope @entity10 got into the horse business in college and took over @entity16 in 1970			1
his son worked on the farm while growing up			2
after college he took a job in the financial sector , but in 1991 he returned to @entity16			2
his brother @entity42 returned a few years later , and their younger sister @entity43 joined after she graduated from college			2
" it 's been pretty much a family business since that point , " pope @entity10 said during a tour of the 1,000 acre property			1
@entity51 is to horse racing what @entity53 is to the domestic auto industry			1
racing and breeding thoroughbreds is a multibillion - dollar business in the state and the source of some 100,000 jobs			1
but " @entity65 " is hardly exempt from these painful economic times , and in fact is taking a severe blow in the global recession			2
" it 's truly an international industry , so we have people , a lot of buyers , from @entity68 come in			1
and they have dialed back , " @entity10 said			1
" domestic buyers have dialed back their participation , as well			1
the good horses are still bringing decent money , but everyone has to lower their expectations			2
" at this year 's @entity80 , which @entity10 calls the horse industry 's version of the @entity84 draft , the gross was down more than 41 percent from last year , the largest year - to - year drop in the 66 - year history of the auction			1
" the prices are down , and our production costs increased with commodity prices going up and so forth , so it definitely puts a squeeze on commercial breeding operations , " @entity10 said			0
" a lot of farms are hurting			0
and then you have the credit squeeze that has hurt a lot of farms , too			0
" @entity10 sees another lean year next year , and then hopes for a rebound because of an odd twist to the laws of supply and demand			0
in 2008 , when the stock market was plummeting , 30 percent fewer mares were bred , so the supply of horses available at auction the year after next will be smaller			1
" i think people just decided to pull back , " @entity10 said			1
" so the supply of horses available at auction will be reduced and that should start to help market conditions			0
" at @entity16 , @entity10 predicts an " about even " year			0
" we 're down at bit , " at the moment , he says			0
" i feel pretty sure there will be quite a few farms that will go out of business			0
" out of business is an all too common theme in @entity123 , a coal country town in @entity15 's @entity125 region about 120 miles away from @entity14 and horse country			1
@entity127 , the unemployment rate in @entity15 is 11.1 percent			1
hazard is the county seat in @entity131 , where the jobless rate has been on a steady climb and is 12.7 percent			1
on @entity136 , a clothing and novelty store is closing down , along with an adjacent print and copying shop			0
fallout , locals say , from the closing of a uniform plant that had employed more than 140 people , and then a @entity144 lumber facility that employed 180			0
@entity145 knew there were problems when @entity144 canceled weekend shifts , " but we did n't think it would be that drastic			0
" the bad news came suddenly in march when workers were told their jobs were being eliminated immediately			1
" they called us in the conference room and said due to market conditions , you know , they had to shut us down			0
" @entity156 has been looking for work for seven months			1
her unemployment check is $ 746 every two weeks			2
she cashed in her @entity144 401 ( k ) and , despite the long - term risks , allows herself a small slice of that money every month , as well			0
" my daughter likes to eat , and she likes clothes , " @entity156 said with a shrug			0
" and we like heat and air conditioning			0
that 's the choices we have to make			2
" her 19 - year - old is enrolled at the local community college , where @entity145 also plans to take classes in hopes of improving her job prospects			0
two older daughters completed college over the past two years , one in @entity182 and other here in @entity15 , but neither has been able to find work			1
" so everything i told them as they were growing up : go to college , get a degree so you can get a good job , it 's just not working out that way			2
" @entity156 tries to keep her spirits up , dryly joking that " you get to see everybody during the day because nobody 's at work			1
" but the long search can be demoralizing			0
" i worked all my life and now i 'm collecting an unemployment check			2
i feel real uncomfortable about that , but there 's no jobs available			1
" when @entity156 returned to the @entity144 plant for the first time , it made her feel sad			0
" the last shift i worked was 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. twelve hour shifts , " she said as she looked through the fence , chained and padlocked shut			0
" @entity214 to see it like this , " @entity156 said			0
" i made a lot of good friends working there			0
we had good times working in there			0
it was n't a glamorous job , but we had fun and we got along , and i miss seeing those people every day			0
