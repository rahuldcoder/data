-- when @entity2 became the 40th president of @entity4 at the start of this year , he was paraded at the @entity7 stadium in front of the waiting press , just as his predecessors before him had			1
the president of @entity4 , after all , has an exalted status			1
usually they are voted for by the club 's socios , or members , the president sets the tone of the club and the scope of its ambition			1
they are held to account , too , for their behavior off the pitch and results on it			0
a picture was taken of the 51 - year - old engineer and entrepreneur , with the club 's famous motto visible in the stadium seats behind him , to his left			1
it is an invocation that sums up how @entity4 's fans and players believe that their club transcends soccer			1
how it represents a progressive @entity44 political and social identity			0
the shirt was deemed so sacred that , for over a century , no sponsor was allowed to sully its famous stripes			0
but , in the same picture , to his right , the words " @entity52 " loom even larger			0
the same company now graces the front of @entity4 's shirts too			1
crossroads @entity2 has taken charge of a club standing on the crossroads , not to mention at the end of one of the darkest periods in @entity4 's recent history			1
in little over a year the club has lost its position as @entity67 's most feared team , changed its manager , seen another beloved former coach die of cancer , seen @entity71 embroiled in an embarrassing tax case and been accused of complicity , at least , in tax avoidance surrounding the transfer deal that brought @entity77 star @entity76 to @entity78			1
it was that final scandal that saw @entity2 's predecessor @entity80 resign in disgrace			1
@entity2 was his deputy and took over , leaving many @entity4 fans unhappy they were n't allowed their traditional vote			1
factor in the recent signing of @entity86 , a player still banned from all soccer related activity after biting a player at the @entity92 finals , the third time he has bitten a player in a game during his short career , and the phrase " @entity4 , " for many , seems to be describing a time passed			1
now @entity2 has been charged with steadying the ship and making sure that is n't the case			1
" things have been very difficult for us , " admits @entity2 in an exclusive , wide - ranging @entity0 interview			1
i mean we also had a lot of things not sporting that has been ... well , developing the club in another way that we were not planning			2
but everything [ that ] comes we try to solve			0
" season ahead given what 's on @entity2 's plate , his immediate focus is the season ahead			1
after a barren year , and the resignation of former coach @entity119 , the club has put its faith in former player @entity121 , returning to a time when coaches were nurtured and promoted from within			1
" i learned very , very much from @entity124			1
he is a genius , " @entity2 said of @entity4 's former coach who , like @entity121 , cut his teeth coaching the @entity128 team			1
" then after @entity124 , @entity130 , which was the natural continuation of this project but @entity130 had very bad medical problems			2
and ( then ) came @entity119			0
@entity119 is a ... well , a coach from @entity134 with another way of looking at football			0
" it was agreed that @entity119 , after a tough transitional season , would stand down			0
according to @entity2 , there was only one choice			2
" ( director of football ) @entity142 told us : ' @entity121 is our man			0
@entity121 is our coach , ' " he recalls			0
" he has been preparing himself in the last few years for this so we took him			0
" the @entity71 factor there has been a changing of the guard on the pitch as much as off it			0
the biggest loss has been @entity152 , who took over as club captain from @entity121 almost a decade ago but has now retired after struggling with injuries			2
all eyes will be on @entity71 , the team 's focal point and the embodiment of the club 's fortunes			2
" it 's unlimited , " @entity2 replies when asked how much @entity71 was worth to @entity4 now			1
" @entity71 came to our club when he was 13 years old			0
this year he will be 27 ... he has been growing within our club			2
he is one of us			0
" @entity71 represents something more than his goals or the titles he won			0
@entity71 represents , a little bit , this spirit of a young player that comes to our @entity171 , to our youth academy , and learns			0
" @entity2 says he is not worried about the tax case , based on offshore payments for image rights , that has dogged @entity71 since last year			1
" that is something that belongs to his personal life , of course , " @entity2 says			2
" he has our support , our help and , well , he 's managing with his advisers , with his lawyers and of course anything he needs @entity4 is there to help him			2
" the @entity76 deal but it is another potential court case that has proved even more damaging to @entity4 's reputation			2
when details of the @entity76 transfer deal was made public , with an alleged $ 10 million shortfall in what was paid and what was declared to the @entity78 authorities , it caused a wave of outrage			0
@entity2 , however , believes that the club did n't do anything wrong			1
" this transfer is being investigated by a judge in @entity78 and we have different interpretations , " he says			0
" what we did , of course , being prudent as much as possible , we pay taxes in @entity77 and also we pay the same taxes in @entity78			0
so we paid twice just to avoid any misunderstandings for the judge			0
when the truth comes out then @entity4 will benefit from this truth			2
" this season @entity4 will try to accommodate three of the finest attacking talents in the world game : @entity71 , @entity76 and @entity86 , even if the club will have to wait for the @entity218 to serve his four - month ban for biting			1
" when we approached @entity86 , it was before the @entity92 , " @entity2 says			1
" we told him that he had the right age			0
playing at @entity223 give him incredible performance also			0
and it was the right time for him to come to our club , to @entity4			1
" we knew from a lot of lot of years ago that @entity86 likes our club , likes our city			1
and we have the advantage			0
his agent is @entity124 's brother ... he 's from @entity4 in his heart , also , so everything was perfect and created the perfect atmosphere that @entity86 accepted			1
and we know that he had better offers than our offer but he came to @entity4			2
" @entity86 ban @entity86 's bite on @entity240 defender @entity239 became , for many , one of the defining images of the @entity92			2
but the incident did n't give @entity2 any second thoughts			2
" no , no. we did n't rethink this decision and we told @entity86 after the bite			2
he knows he did wrong , " @entity2 says			2
that 's very important for us			0
that means he knows that he did not do things properly -- and of course , coming to our city , coming to our club , there 's going to be a way of managing @entity86 , because at @entity223 he was a perfect player			1
@entity223 fans can tell it , supporters can tell it			0
" on question remains : how would @entity4 react if he bit someone again ? " this is now a question , " @entity2 admits			1
" this is a question that a lot of people now ask us			0
we can not talk about something that could happen or not			0
what we know is that we accept this responsibility and he also wants this responsibility of bringing @entity86 to the family of football			2
" so confident is @entity4 that @entity86 will not err again , @entity2 has not insisted on a " no biting " clause in the contract			1
" no , there is no clause , " he confirms			0
" if the clause did exist we would n't say it , but it does n't exist			0
" @entity124 's return ? as the season approaches -- @entity282 kicks off on august 23 -- many question marks remain over where @entity4 is headed and whether it is really " more than a club " or susceptible to the same shenanigans as any other team in the modern game			1
@entity121 will have to hit the ground running , but @entity2 believes that the club 's special ethos is such that few can resist its gravitational pull , even former coaches like @entity124			1
" oh i 'm sure , " @entity2 says when asked whether @entity124 would ever return to @entity4			1
" i 'm sure that all the people that are from @entity4 , they have @entity4 in their heart , they go back to @entity4 and help the club			1
it 's something that has happened in the past and will continue in the future			0
" i always say to a lot of people that i see a future of @entity4			2
i hope that after 2022 ... with a lot of players that are right now playing or players that are training other teams , coming back to our team as coaches , as a sport director , as members or as presidents of the club			0
" because at the end , we are like a family			0
