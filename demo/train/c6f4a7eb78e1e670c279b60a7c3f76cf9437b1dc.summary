-- @entity1 sent out a message of intent to the other @entity5 finalists as they stunned highly - fancied @entity6 2 - 1 in @entity7 to secure a place in the quarterfinals			1
@entity10 celebrates @entity1 's second goal in their superb 2 - 1 victory over @entity6			1
@entity14 and @entity15 struck the goals as @entity1 , who had only ever beaten @entity6 once before , produced arguably the first major upset of the tournament			1
@entity20 pulled a goal back late on for @entity6 with his third strike in two games to set up a nail - biting finale , but there was to be no way back for @entity28 's team , who finished with 10 men following the 90th - minute dismissal of substitute @entity32			1
both sides came into the game having won their opening matches , although @entity6 had looked far more impressive in seeing off @entity36 than @entity1 had in defeating @entity37			1
however , it was @entity40 's side who turned on the style at the @entity43 as they took control of @entity46 with two wins out of two			0
a frantic start to the match promised much but for all their huffing and puffing , neither side were able to create anything resembling a chance in the opening 20 minutes as defences held firm			0
the ball did find its way into the back of the net in the 22nd minute when @entity6 striker @entity61 slotted home past @entity63 but the offside flag had already gone up against the @entity66 man			1
the deadlock was broken for real just two minutes after that incident though , when @entity1 went ahead through @entity14			1
@entity69 sent over a superb cross from the left and @entity14 nipped in front of marker @entity73 to slide the ball in at the far post , giving veteran @entity6 goalkeeper @entity78 no chance			1
@entity1 had a gilt - edged chance to make it 2 - 0 in the 30th minute , but @entity81 wasted it			1
@entity82 chipped a pass into the area which was flicked back towards the penalty spot by @entity10 , but the in - rushing @entity81 was unable to cap a well - worked move as he blazed over			2
@entity6 knew they needed to step up through the gears and they finally made @entity63 earn his keep with two efforts in rapid succession			2
the first saw @entity63 push away a thunderous @entity94 free - kick , before the @entity96 custodian awkwardly deflected away a @entity98 effort with his knee			0
@entity98 then headed a @entity101 corner just over from close range as the @entity103 stepped up their efforts for an equalizer before the break			0
however , @entity28 's side very nearly found themselves two goals behind in the 43rd minute , and they needed a fine reaction stop from @entity78 to deny @entity81 , who chested down @entity10 's pass and smashed in a first - time volley			0
having seen his side let off the hook , @entity28 opted for a more adventurous approach in the second half as he sacrificed full - back @entity73 for jet - heeled winger @entity116 during the interval			2
aside from a @entity94 shot over the crossbar though , @entity1 looked fairly comfortable at the start of the period and also had a decent effort of their own with @entity123 firing in a shot that @entity78 gathered , although not before seeing it squirm through his hands first			2
however , @entity78 's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of his net as @entity1 stunned the @entity103 with a second goal in the 62nd minute			1
a @entity82 cross from the right took a deflection off @entity20 before arrowing goalwards and although @entity78 , who had begun to come out for the initial cross , managed to dive backwards and get a hand on it , the ball struck his near post before rebounding back out to @entity10 , who had the easy task of slotting home			2
@entity6 looked for an immediate response but aside from a @entity32 shot that fizzed across the face of goal , they were still finding it difficult to create chances against a well - organised @entity1 backline			1
@entity28 's side earned themselves a lifeline with 12 minutes to go though when @entity20 lashed home a shot on the half - volley after the ball had fallen kindly to him in the box			2
@entity6 could not build on that goal , though , and their final hopes of getting anything out of the match all but disappeared when @entity32 was given a straight red card for shoving @entity161 in the final minute of an absorbing encounter			1
" i want to especially congratulate my players , not only for the fight they showed but for playing an excellent match , " said a delighted @entity40			0
" there is no other way to beat the @entity103 than to play well			0
they 're still a great team , though , and still one of the favorites for the title			0
" @entity94 said the @entity103 had to recognize they must improve			0
" our movement was not fluid enough throughout the match and as a consequence we eked out few chances			0
" we played below our level in all departments			0
now we absolutely have to win our last match against @entity37 , " said the @entity179 midfielder .			0

@entity1 stun favorites @entity6 2 - 1 in their group b encounter in @entity7
@entity14 and @entity15 both on target as @entity1 make it two wins from two
@entity20 pulls goal back for @entity6 with his third strike in two games
