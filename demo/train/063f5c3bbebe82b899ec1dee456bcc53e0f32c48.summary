-- you may inadvertently be getting more than you bargained for when you put paprika in your chicken paprikash			0
a new @entity5 report , " pathogens and @entity16 in spices , " says that 12 % of @entity7 spice imports are contaminated with bug parts , rodent hairs and other ingredients more appropriate to a witches ' brew than your mother 's favorite recipe			1
the @entity5 study also found that 7 % of spice imports the inspectors examined were contaminated with salmonella			1
@entity22 are toxic bacteria that can trigger diarrhea , fever , and abdominal cramps			0
the amount of " filth " the @entity5 found in imported spice was twice that found in other kinds of imported food			1
the report characterized this as a " systemic challenge			0
" the agency conducted the research to figure out what kind of risks the contamination poses to the @entity7 public and what the @entity5 can do to lower any kind of health risks			1
there is good news , however , regardless of the ick factor			0
the study did find that only a tiny fraction of the @entity7 public has gotten sick from spices			2
in the 37 years of records examined , it found only 14 outbreaks worldwide associated with spices and seasonings , resulting in fewer than 2,000 human illnesses and 128 hospitalizations			1
the @entity5 characterized that as a " relatively small number of outbreaks " compared to other foodborne illness			1
the @entity5 says the issue may be underreported			1
patients often forget to list spices when they describe what they ate before they became sick			2
people also eat spices in such tiny quantities that there is less exposure to pathogens than with food which is eaten in larger servings			1
" we would agree ready - to - eat spices should be clean and meet @entity5 standards and be pathogen - free , " said @entity73 , executive director of the @entity74			1
" we did find it really interesting that the @entity5 said they were going to use this report to develop a plan to reduce illness , but if you look at the data we do n't think that 's a significant problem			1
that 's a small number of illnesses			2
" 22,000 pounds of meat recalled ; possible @entity87 the report points out most of the contamination likely comes from what it describes as " poor storage practices			0
" @entity73 said it is not a big surprise the @entity5 would find some issues with spices that arrive in the @entity7 in raw form			1
tests did not distinguish between the ready - to - eat product that has been cleaned overseas or the raw product			0
spice can come to the @entity7 cleaned and bottled in another country , or in big sacks and containers that then go to a commercial facility , @entity73 said			0
at the facility the spice is cleaned in what 's called a " microbial reduction process , " in which the spice is cleaned several times to get rid of the sticks and stones and those scary - sounding bug parts			0
since most spices can not be grown in the @entity7 , much of the supply comes from countries like @entity119 and @entity120 -- the two countries that have the highest rate of contamination			2
@entity73 said much of the spice that comes into the @entity7 comes through a complex supply chain			0
that 's where contamination can enter , she said , starting with the small farmers who gather the crop , dry it and then often store it until they need the cash			2
it then goes to a collector where it is again stored until there is enough of a supply from local farmers			0
only then is it shipped to a bigger facility for treatment			0
" it goes through some very small hands before it gets to the first processing stage , " @entity73 said			0
the @entity142 of @entity119 is currently working directly with farmers to put additional safety practices in place and to lower the risk of contamination , the @entity5 said			1
the agency has provided some food safety training in @entity119 , as has the @entity74			0
the @entity5 says it has increased its inspections of spice facilities and will take further action to strengthen the spice safety net			2

twice as much contamination found in imported spices as other imports
" pathogens and @entity16 " also found salmonella in 7 % of spices tested
contaminated spices have caused " relatively small " outbreaks of illness , @entity5 says
