-- forty years ago this week golf legend @entity1 scored one of his most memorable victories at the @entity4 and now he is willing @entity5 to do the same in the 2104 edition at @entity8 as the @entity10 battles back from injury and loss of form			1
@entity15 player was the last player to lead outright for all four rounds of the oldest major when he won at @entity17 and @entity18 in 1974 , adding to an earlier triumph at that year 's masters at @entity21			1
" @entity5 is definitely the most talented man who ever held a golf club in his hand , " @entity14 told @entity0			1
but the former world number one has been troubled by injury this season and has only played once since march -- sidelined for the masters and the @entity28 -- and missing the cut at @entity30 in his comeback event			1
@entity14 believes golf is the poorer for @entity5 not being at the top of the leaderboard			1
" we need this icon			0
he improves ratings and brings in more media attention to golf , " said the 78 - year - old @entity15			0
" and back home in @entity15 a lot of young black players are aspiring to be a champion like him			0
" @entity14 , who won nine majors and 165 tournaments in an incredible career spanning over 50 years , does however acknowledge that @entity5 is at a crossroads in his career			1
the 38 - year - old @entity10 has not triumphed in one of golf 's big four events since his remarkable 2008 @entity28 win -- his 14th major -- before a combination of damaging revelations in his private life and injuries sent his fortunes into decline			1
" he has got a challenge on his hand and it would not be a surprise if he never wins another major , " admited @entity14			1
" but if he does , he could go on to win quite a few more because he has what i call ' it			0
' " that ' it ' the @entity15 legend believes is reserved for the true superstars of golf : " in my humble opinion you have to win six majors to be classed as a superstar , " added @entity14			1
ahead of the @entity4 's start thursday , @entity14 also thinks that @entity80 irishman @entity79 has that quality and can build on his two majors -- perhaps with victory at the @entity85 seaside links			2
" @entity79 is a wonderful player , an unbelievable talent , " said @entity14 , who is also an admirer of current world no. 1 @entity88 of @entity89 and fellow @entity15 @entity90 and @entity91 , saying the latter has the " most fantastic golf swing			2
" but for a dedicated and driven man such as @entity14 there is no substitute for sheer hard work			2
" talent is one think , to apply it another			0
" he gives the example of @entity10 golfer @entity102 , who made golf look easy , but had to give best to players like himself and @entity105 and perhaps never quite fulfilled his talent , with just a @entity4 win at @entity108 in 1973 in the majors			0
this time 40 years ago @entity14 came into the @entity4 having already won the @entity110 for the second time			2
" i can remember it like yesterday , " said the @entity15			0
" i was one shot ahead of @entity102 and @entity112 playing the last and hit a nine - iron , tossed the club to my caddy and knew i was going to make a birdie			0
" that left him two shots clear of the chasing pair at @entity21 , which he won for the third and final time in 1978			0
player then went on to win at @entity17 by four shots from @entity123 's @entity122 , but only after surviving a near lost ball on the penultimate hole of the final round and then famously having to play a left handed shot after his approach shot to the 18th rested against the clubhouse wall			2
it was held to be the archetypal example of @entity14 's tenacity and shot saving skills around the green , which was one of the keys to his prolonged success as a professional .			0
