a former senior member of president @entity2 's national security team is panning the administration 's decision to rule out the use of ground troops to fight @entity7 and questioning @entity2 's leadership style			1
" i take the position that when you 're commander in chief that you oughta keep all options on the table ... to be able to have the flexibility to do what is necessary in order to defeat the enemy , " former defense secretary and cia director @entity16 told @entity17			2
" we 're conducting airstrikes			0
but to make those airstrikes work , to be able to do what you had to do , you do n't -- you do n't just send planes in and drop bombs			2
you 've got ta have targets			0
you 've got ta know what you 're goin ' after			0
to do that , you do need people on the ground			0
" @entity16 's comments are a stinging rebuke of @entity2 at a crucial point in his administration as the president battles multiple national security threats , including @entity7 , a resurgent @entity38 and the spread of @entity40			1
his memoir , " @entity42 , " describes a @entity43 that did not use its " leverage " to try to keep a residual force in @entity45			1
" those on our side of the debate viewed the @entity43 as so eager to rid itself of @entity45 that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests , " he wrote in the book			1
the @entity43 has argued it could not convince then - prime minister @entity57 to come to terms			1
but @entity16 told @entity17 the @entity43 did not use its power to pressure @entity57 enough			1
" what i 'm saying is that @entity57 was the kind of leader that you had to constantly put pressure on to direct him in the right direction , " he said			2
" we had , with @entity45 -- made a commitment with regards to military assistance , f - 16 fighter planes , other types of military aid , that i think if we had said , ' look , you know , if you 're not gon na give us -- the agreement that we need to maintain our forces there , you know , we may not provide this kind of assistance			1
" @entity16 : should have armed @entity82 rebels sooner the @entity43 , he said , needed to do more " to try to push him			1
" " you need to threaten guys like that , who wo n't come along			2
and everybody knew that , " he said			0
" i think what happened was -- is that because @entity57 kept resisting this effort , that there was a sense that , ' look , why should we want this more than the @entity45 want this ? ' and if they 're -- if they 're putting up a fuss about this , then -- we might as well just pick up and leave			1
" @entity16 describes a leadership vacuum on the issue , calling it a lack of " active advocacy " by the president on the issue			1
in the end , he said , " i think the kind of push and direct involvement that i think could have had an impact simply never developed			0
" as to whether @entity7 would be as much a threat today had a residual force been left in @entity45 , he told @entity17 , " i do think that if we had had a presence there , it might not have created the kind of vacuum that we saw develop in @entity45			1
" @entity16 was aligned with much of the president 's national security team on this argument -- and on the question of arming the @entity82 rebels in 2012 , which the president also resisted			1
" i mean , it 's understandable , " @entity16 said , explaining @entity2 's argument that the weapons could get into the wrong hands			1
" but at the same time , if we 're going to influence the rebel forces , if we 're gon na try to establish a moderate element to those forces , so that they can , in fact , provide leadership not only to confront ( @entity82 president @entity134 , but also to help us in terms of a political transition , that it was important to provide this kind of assistance in order to have some leverage over what they -- they -- they were gon na do			1
" there was honest disagreement -- but then no decision			0
" to a large extent it was n't that the president kind of said -- said , ' no , we should n't do it			2
' the president kind of never really came to a decision as to whether or not it should happen , " @entity16 said in the interview			1
" i think it basically sat there for a while and then got to the point where everybody just kind of assumed that it was not gon na happen			0
" in the book , he described some hesitation and half - steps regarding this issue			1
" i mean , it was that kind of just a hesitation to really , you know , do what needed to be done			2
now , you know , do n't get me wrong , " he said			2
" i think he was very strong in terms of the war on terrorism			0
and he made some tough decisions			0
but there were these decisions that basically never were confronted , that i think -- in many ways -- contributed to the problems we 're facing today			0
" @entity16 told @entity17 the president is now taking appropriate , decisive action on @entity7 -- albeit a bit late			1
" he 's made the decision to put troops on the ground in @entity45 , to try to help the -- security forces , " he said			1
" he 's made the decision to -- arm and train rebel forces in @entity82			1
and he 's made the decision to conduct air attacks			2
so in many ways -- he 's made the right decisions now			2
i think those decisions should 've been made two years ago			0
" the portrait @entity16 sketches of @entity2 sometimes looks more like a professor than a president			1
" he relies on the logic of his presentation , with the hope that ultimately people will embrace that logic and then do what 's right , " he said			2
" you know what ? in 50 years , my experience is logic does n't work in @entity212			2
you got ta basically go after people and make them understand what they have to do			0
and that means you create a war room			0
you have to push people			0
" @entity16 described to @entity17 a sense the president found that work unrewarding at the very least , even distasteful			1
" i think it -- it offended him that people would not really get serious and work on the issues , " he said			0
" i think as a result of that , he just felt , you know , ' how -- how can i deal with people that simply wo n't -- do n't wan na do the right thing for the country ? ' well , the reality is , if you wan na govern in this country , you have to deal with people you do n't like			0
" while @entity16 had left the administration by 2013 , he argues that the president made a mistake by not acting when @entity82 used chemical weapons against its own people -- violating his own clearly drawn red line			1
" i think at that point the president very clearly should 've said , ' you have crossed that red line			0
and we 're not gon na allow that to happen			0
' and i think initially my sense was they were gon na do exactly that			0
but somehow they backed away from it			0
" the airstrikes against @entity82 did not happen			2
it 's clearly a struggle for @entity16 -- who said he admires and likes the president -- to reconcile the decisive @entity2 who approved the raid against @entity260 with the president who vacillated over @entity82 airstrikes			1
" a president that made the decision to go after @entity260 , and made a very gutsy decision to do that , in spite of whatever was being recommended to him , but he -- he knew that this had to be done			0
and i really respected that decision			0
i just could not have imagined him -- not making the same decision with it came to the credibility of the @entity276 on drawing that red line in @entity82			1
" to no one 's surprise , the @entity43 has not warmly welcomed @entity16 's version of history			1
vice president @entity282 last week said it was " inappropriate " for former administration officials to write books criticizing the policies of the @entity43			1
" at least let the guy get out of office first			0
" asked if @entity282 has a point , @entity16 told @entity17 , " you know , i 'm of the view that you do n't put a hold on history			2
history is what it is , " he said , adding , " i recommend the president and vice president @entity282 take the time to read the book			0
because i think -- you know , when you read it , it 's a pretty balanced presentation of what happened			0

@entity16 writes that @entity2 was not forceful enough to try to keep a residual force in @entity45
the @entity43 has said it could n't convince then - prime minister @entity57 to agree
a @entity276 presence in @entity45 might have prevented @entity7 's growth , @entity16 said
@entity16 also describes a president of half - steps and hesitation when it came to @entity82
