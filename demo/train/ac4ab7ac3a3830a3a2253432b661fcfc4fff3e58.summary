-- in august , while 450 of @entity2 's a-list guests gathered at a lavish estate in @entity4 to celebrate @entity6 's fairytale wedding , about 2 million people honored the special occasion in their own way : by watching " @entity6 , superstar , " the hardcore sex tape she made with musician @entity12 on the website of the adult video company @entity15			1
@entity15 is one of the most well - known companies in the porn industry -- its superhero parody flick " @entity20 " was the best - selling adult movie of 2010 , according to adult video news ( @entity22 )			1
" when we started this business about 26 years ago , it was completely different than it is today , " says @entity15 founder and co-chairman @entity23			1
" it was a very small business			0
the people in the business did n't really talk about it ; they were sort of underground			0
over time , it really started to change and i think we had a lot to do with that			0
we began to really court the media , go out there and talk about our movies and talk about our girls			2
" @entity15 further distinguished itself from other companies by putting six - figure budgets behind its movies , not only to get talent and prominent adult film directors like @entity49 and @entity50 , but for high production value , quality writing ( yes , pornos have scripts ! ) and marketing			1
in the ' 80s , a billboard on @entity57 in @entity58 promoted @entity15 's stars and the company hired a publicist and created media kits , all of which had never been done in that industry before			1
" these things that were so obvious in the mainstream world , we brought to adult , " @entity23 says			0
" we were able to get articles written in @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 , where they were talking about the business of adult ( films ) and how much money there was in it			0
that turned the tide away from people thinking all of the girls are drug addicts and prostitutes and this is sort of the last stop			0
" today , a top in - house @entity15 production takes about six months from start to finish and can cost several hundred thousand dollars			1
@entity15 also decided to follow the old @entity2 studio model of signing their female actresses , also known as @entity15 , to exclusive contracts			1
" the theory being , " @entity23 says , " that if we were going to spend the money on promoting them , we did n't want the girls to make movies for other companies			2
" @entity103 , now retired , is still widely regarded as the most famous and successful @entity15			1
currently , @entity15 has only two contract girls , @entity105 and @entity106 , the latter of whom is best known for being the woman who was with @entity110 at @entity112 's @entity111 last october in one of the well publicized events that ultimately cost him his job on the tv show " @entity117			1
" in addition to the skin - flicks that @entity15 has produced over the last two decades , the company now has a very successful parody division that puts an x-rated spin on mainstream @entity2 blockbusters like " @entity124 , " " @entity125 , " " @entity126 , " and " @entity127			1
" in addition to its own productions , @entity15 is also known for buying celebrity sex tapes			1
more than 10 years ago @entity131 and @entity132 caused a stir when a sex tape from their honeymoon was leaked to the public			1
@entity15 bought the internet rights and that video remains @entity15 's best - performing celebrity tape ever , according to @entity23			1
" although at some point , " @entity23 says , " i expect the @entity6 tape to surpass that			2
" since then , @entity15 has purchased @entity155 's famous " 1 night in @entity154 , " and tapes featuring former " @entity153 " @entity145 , actor @entity146 's daughter @entity145 , former @entity148 wrestler @entity147 , country singer @entity149 , " @entity151 " finalist @entity150 and reality show star @entity152			2
" with the @entity157 , people feel more comfortable with celebrities than ever before , " @entity23 says			0
" they follow them on @entity160 and on @entity161 , so it 's just a natural progression that they 'd be interested in seeing them in an adult movie where they 're much different than we 're used to			0
the fact is that if you look at the celebrity tapes that have come out , if you look at @entity6 , @entity155 , it 's done nothing but help their careers			0
" @entity145 cited @entity6 's meteoric rise as the inspiration for her foray into the adult industry			2
she told @entity179 , " i 've watched how successful @entity6 became and i think a lot of it was due to the release of her sex tape			1
" @entity6 sued @entity15 when @entity15 first made the sex tape public			1
the legal battle ended with a monetary settlement in which @entity6 would share in the profits , @entity23 said			0
@entity15 puts a lot of resources into its celebrity division			1
" it 's so important to have unique content , " @entity23 says , because " the typical stuff " can be watched free on the @entity157			0
" when it comes to celebrity tapes , there are very few of them , " he says			0
" remember , there are a few thousand adult movies produced every year ; there 's maybe three celebrity tapes			2
" there is not a single day that goes by that we do n't get a phone call from some guy claiming to have some tape on some celebrity			2
" ninety - nine percent of them , he says , " are bogus			2
" what 's his dream celebrity tape ? @entity23 once answered that question by naming @entity215 and @entity216			2
today he says , " @entity217 and @entity218 would n't be too bad			0
" but let 's get realistic			0
" we 're often surprised by some of the people we donÂ¹t think would do it and show a little passing interest , " @entity23 says			0
" but @entity225 not going to name any names			0
you 'll just have to see			0
