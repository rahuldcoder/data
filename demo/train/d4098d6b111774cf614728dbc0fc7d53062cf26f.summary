-- how do you keep hope alive ? the news of the recovery of @entity5 and @entity5 , along with @entity5 , sent shock waves through the nation and the community of folks who used to work at " @entity10 , " a show that ran for decades , trying to bring missing children home			1
when you deal with tragedy every day , you absolutely live for moments like these -- moments that came all too rarely			0
i do n't think we aired @entity5 's case -- she was an adult when she went missing , and we sadly had to draw the line on those cases -- but we did tell @entity23 and @entity25 ' stories , and they became close to our hearts			1
we worked like madmen when children went missing , because we knew that if they were not recovered that first day or possibly the next , the chances that they were still alive began to diminish rapidly			1
and yet , as days turned into weeks and months , i would listen to the families and to the cops and @entity34 agents on this case , and hundreds of others , and i would marvel at their determination and their belief that we would , in fact , solve this one			1
and i wondered : how did they all manage , in the midst of such sorrow , to keep hope alive ? it was a question i have pondered all my life			2
i was about the age @entity23 is now when my stepsister , @entity48 , disappeared			2
she suffered from schizophrenia and one night ran out of our house in @entity53 , @entity54 , in a mania - induced rage			0
she was last seen headed to @entity56 on the a train , wearing no coat in the middle of winter , probably without a dime in her pocket			0
my family was not one of those brave , strong families i would meet years later ; @entity48 's disappearance tore our family apart			1
her mother was driven to madness by the not - knowing , my father driven to depression and attempted suicide by a life that had become a lonely prison , caged in by his wife 's grief			2
they became , thoroughly and utterly , hopeless			0
i suppose that working on " @entity10 " gave me a chance to do for others what i could not do for my own family -- and , sure enough , the very first story i worked on was the case of a missing 5 - year - old girl from @entity84			1
we managed to bring that girl home to her family , and until i had a child of my own , it remained the most important thing i had ever done in my life			1
before " @entity10 " was canceled , 60 missing children were found			1
and in every case , every one , you could trace the successful return of that child to someone -- a family member , a cop -- who just decided to never give up hope			1
our host , @entity101 , a man who 'd lost his own child to terrible violence , would never let us give up on a case			2
and so we pressed on			0
whenever a child would go missing , the media would jump all over the story for a few days and then move on to other things			1
but we kept airing the case , year after year , hoping against hope that something would turn up			2
whenever the energy to keep going on a case would flag , someone would remind us of the miracles that came before			0
along with the families , we were buoyed -- elated , overjoyed -- by cases like @entity119 , an 11 - year - old who disappeared from a country road near his parents ' home in @entity124 in october 2002 and was found alive four years later			1
and whose parents never , ever gave up hoping			0
@entity127 , whom we found after she was held for nine months by a so - called street preacher			2
or the astounding case of @entity130 , who was recovered after 18 long years and who was honored tuesday night -- in one of those wonderful moments of synchronicity -- at the @entity137 's annual @entity136			2
as so many people rejoice , i have to admit to some pangs of sadness as i watch the news of the recovery of @entity23 , @entity25 and @entity5			0
i know there are so many families , like my own , who fear that they will never see their loved ones again			2
we think of the joy that @entity25 and @entity5 's families must feel			1
we watch as @entity23 's relatives exult at her return : " i 'm excited to see her , " said her cousin			0
" i 'm excited to hold her , excited to squeeze her , to tell her how much i love her and miss her " -- and know that we may never get to say those words			0
i talked to @entity157 today , my old boss , and he told me , " people who do n't follow this do n't realize what an absolute miracle this is			0
this just does n't happen			0
when you do this for a living you realize , this is a goddamned miracle			0
" and it is that fact -- that miracles do indeed happen -- that every family of every missing child is trying to hold onto			1
i know , because i have spent 15 years working with them , that moments like these remind you : the hardest thing to do is , in the end , the only thing to do			0
you have to keep hope alive			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

@entity184 oversaw the missing child cases for " @entity10 "
60 cases were solved but not the *personal* one : his stepsister 's disappearance
he saw brave families hold out hope , and show would air and *re-air* their cases
@entity184 says every family of a missing child is holding onto hope after women found
