-- @entity2 ' upcoming movie " @entity3 " might be a little confusing for those who have n't read the book on which it 's based			1
in the movie , actors play multiple races with varying accents and even different genders -- and they do it across eras past , present , and future			0
despite this , @entity2 -- who called the screenplay a " page turner like ' @entity17 ' " -- thinks it will become self - explanatory as the film progresses , especially for careful observers			1
" even before the opening credits say ' @entity3 , ' " @entity2 said , " @entity24 as ( the character ) @entity25 explains the movie in one line			1
if you 're hip to figure that out , you 'll see it			0
" for those who miss that explanation , @entity2 had one of his own ready : " i found it actually gave a language to the connections we all have with each other , " he said			1
" what ' @entity3 ' is all about -- individual people have to make this decision between cruelty and kindness , someone has to go against a mindless version of the status quo , and it 's this idea that great acts of kindness last forever and reverberate through eternity			1
it 's another definition of human history			0
" but , said @entity2 , some stories are more important than others to the larger narrative			1
take presidential politics for example : @entity2 takes the recent round of presidential debates with a grain of salt			1
" you know what ? the debates are just tv shows , " he said			1
" now , they carry a lot of weight because of all the stuff that goes on , but they 're just tv shows			1
i do n't think there 's any new policy that comes out of them			2
" @entity2 said it 's " interesting to watch the ballyhoo " following a debate , especially regarding a candidate 's choice of words , such as @entity83 's " women in binders " comment			1
" you know what ? there are a lot of people who have binders full of women , " @entity2 joked			1
" actually , i have a loose leaf notebook that has them in it			0
" but despite the discussion following a televised debate , @entity2 does n't think the actual debate is much of a factor in deciding the election			1
he cites the @entity100 - @entity99 debates in 2004 , in which @entity100 would jump in the polls following a showdown with @entity99 , and yet @entity100 ultimately lost the race			0
so even if one candidate seems to dominate , and the other crumbles , it wo n't matter , @entity2 said , " unless someone says something so incredibly dumb that you ca n't trust them after a while			1
but those guys are n't going to do that			0
they 're both good at what they 're doing			0
they 've both got it			0
but i do n't think anybody says anything that magically alters our concept of anything			0
" but , as @entity2 well knows , anyone can say something " incredibly dumb " once in a while			2
@entity2 , for example , did so on " @entity128 " friday			2
speaking in the voice of one of his " @entity3 " characters , he accidentally swore on live television			2
but will it make anyone trust him less ? probably not , but it might encourage networks to use a seven - second delay while he 's promoting the film -- an idea he suggested seconds after using the f - word			0
" man , oh man , " @entity2 apologized on " @entity128			2
" " i 'm sorry , i slipped			0
... i have never done that before			0
i would apologize to the kids in @entity145 that are watching right now			0
and let me say the next time i 'm on the show , there will be a seven - second delay			0
" @entity2 to make @entity152 debut			2

@entity2 is appearing in the new film " @entity3 "
he says he does n't think the debates will determine upcoming election
@entity2 said he viewed the debates as like tv shows
