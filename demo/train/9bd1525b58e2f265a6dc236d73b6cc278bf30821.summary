-- " hi i 'm @entity2			1
i 'm a mom , a wife , the ceo of @entity4 but most of all i 'm a disruptor			1
" @entity2 has been the driving force behind making the @entity8 both hip and profitable , by bringing in celebrities from @entity10 to @entity11 and boosting sales dramatically			1
digital sales now account for approximately 45 % of @entity4 's ( @entity4 and @entity15 ) total revenues , according to @entity16			1
@entity0 's @entity17 finds out how she did it and what inspires her			1
upbringing @entity17 : you did n't study fashion , so how did you get into this business ? @entity2 : i probably have one of the most unconventional career paths ever			1
my parents married young but were n't able to have children so my father 's boss in the produce business lent them the money to adopt me			1
i felt a real responsibility to be the first one to go to college , and the first one to be successful			2
i grew up very fast , i took things very seriously			2
i graduated high school at 16 and went to college , determined to be an attorney			2
i also got engaged very young , at 19			2
but when i was in my last semester of senior year of college i realized i was leading someone else 's life and i was n't really recognizing things that were inside me that were really important			1
creativity and curiosity and really experiencing things			2
i moved to @entity48 and was offered a job working for a company called @entity52 international			2
it was a menswear conglomerate at the time , working for the president of their international division			2
early on i was told i could do anything i wanted to do			2
it was n't an issue being a woman or not coming from a wealthy family , and that is what always inspired me			2
the vision is : how was it perceived when you first joined @entity4 in 2006 ? @entity69 : it was definitely an interesting time			0
i spent the first 18 years of my career in the menswear industry			0
when i started polo jeans , which was my startup experience , and then i went to @entity75 , so those were somewhat difference transitions			0
when it was announced that i was leaving @entity75 , to go to what at the time was called @entity81 retail , it was n't exactly looked at as aspirational			0
is : but why was it so attractive to you ? @entity69 : because i had seen the world changing			0
i had the opportunity to be traveling globally , to @entity86 to @entity87 , @entity88			0
i saw the wave of growth of mobile interaction in @entity86 that was n't even glistening here at that time			0
how people were interfacing with brands			1
how technology was going to change things , how content was becoming power			0
so i knew that there was something there and i thought this could be part of it			0
i was at home watching @entity4 , keeping an eye on the competition but i 'm also food network lover			1
i remember my husband saying " what are you doing " and i said " i 'm trying to see what 's gon na click "			1
all of a sudden i saw @entity112 -- who was engaging and entertaining and he was n't selling			0
he was inspiring and engaging customers and they wanted to buy his product because of that			0
the next day i went and had lunch with chairman @entity117 at the @entity118 and kind of laid out this vision			0
and what 's wonderful , in pure @entity117 fashion he was like , go forth			1
and you know - i jumped in			0
is : do you shop at @entity4 ? @entity69 : i 'm going to tell you the truth			0
my husband once burst out laughing and i said what 's so funny			1
he said you just got a letter from yourself for being one of the best customers at @entity4 ! is : how much do you buy ? @entity69 : i think i might be one of , if not the biggest jewelry customers			0
i believe that the reason that i really understand our consumer is i am her			0
i love the thrill of it , i love discovery , i love the story behind what i 'm buying			0
you can walk with me in my home and i will tell you the story of where i found that chair and how i found that chair and every single piece			1
the celeb factor is : part of the reason for your success has been you attracting major celebrities and their brands and bringing them to @entity4			1
why has it done so well ? @entity69 : one of the things that we said early on is if we 're going to have credibility in this idea of editorial program commerce , we need every one of the individuals that come to @entity4 , they have to have a great product , a great story and be a great storyteller			0
it 's about the story , so if you look at our recent 100 @entity168 or @entity169 with our @entity171 partnership , those are things that can transport people they can feel they 're part of that journey and then they can be inspired to want the product , and that 's what we 're trying to do			1
the challenges is : what are some of the challenges you 've faced in your time here ? @entity69 : the challenge was getting people to embrace the new , and dealing with being dismissed			1
it hurts because you take it personally , but it makes you stronger			0
i 'll never forget when i first went to some fancy cocktail party in @entity48 , somebody said asked what i did , and i said i was the ceo of @entity81 retail and we have @entity4 , and they go ( whispering ) " i 've shopped on @entity4 " and i go , " why are you whispering ? ! " but it was a very sobering experience and one that really , reinforced my belief of how to behave , as a leader as an individual			1
inspire : actress who became @entity204 's ' secret weapon '			2
