-- the crew of the @entity2 marked the 10th anniversary of continuous human occupation of the orbiting science laboratory with a typical workday , pausing only briefly for a chat with @entity9 chief @entity8 and questions from international reporters			1
" it 's kind of mind - boggling when you stop and think about what you 've done , " @entity12 told the crew			2
@entity12 is a former @entity9 astronaut who flew on four space shuttle missions prior to the station 's 2000 opening			1
the football - field sized platform passed the 10 - year mark early tuesday , some 57,361 orbits of @entity22 after the first crew came aboard , according to @entity9			2
on october 25 , the station eclipsed the previous record for constant human living in space , passing the @entity31 space station @entity32			1
since the first module , the @entity31 - built @entity34 , launched on november 20 , 1998 , 103 vehicles have traveled to the station , bringing 196 people to visit or live long - term and conduct science experiments and other work , according to @entity9			0
the station has traveled more than 1.5 billion miles -- the equivalent of eight round trips to the @entity42 habitation of the station began in 2000			0
@entity12 said the international flavor of the station 's construction , supply system and staffing do more to prove that humans can get along than many earthbound diplomats , @entity12 told the astronauts			2
" you 're part of an amazing legacy there on the station , " he said			0
people need look no further than the anniversary to recognize the station 's most remarkable accomplishment , said astronaut @entity59			1
" ten years of constant habitation in space is an amazing achievement in and of itself , " she said			0
but the station has also produced advances in science , medicine and environmental technology that are helping change life on @entity22 , according to @entity9			0
the agency says more than 600 science experiments have been conducted aboard the station , with results helping produce new strategies to deliver cancer drugs , advances in vaccine development and a possible treatment for a form of muscular dystrophy , among other things			0
the commemoration of the anniversary was clouded by the station 's uncertain future			1
while the 15 nations involved in the space station program have agreed in principal to continue operating it for another decade , the @entity84 is scheduled to retire its space shuttle fleet after two more flights -- cutting off a main supply route to get materials to the station			1
while @entity31 spacecraft and commercial providers are expected to take up some of the slack and help keep the station operating for another 10 years , station crew members acknowledged that the shuttle 's retirement will make the station 's mission more challenging			1
" i think it 's not a real problem to supply the station with consumables and some other items , but i think it 's a real problem to deliver the results , " @entity31 cosmonaut @entity102 said during a news conference with reporters			0
" now we can deliver only digital data , but sometimes it 's necessary to bring back some physical items			0

monday was the 10th anniversary of a constant human *presence* aboard the station
it 's now the longest continuously lived - in space vehicle in *history*
the station 's future is uncertain as the @entity84 prepares to end its shuttle program
