-- the @entity2 @entity1 is coming to the rescue of @entity4 senator @entity4 , airing its first television ad in @entity6 starting wednesday morning , @entity0 has learned			1
the @entity1 has been playing a big role this election year by spending millions on ads to prop up incumbents in @entity12 primaries , and now in the general election , to help defeat @entity15 incumbents			1
spending money in the ruby red state of @entity6 to defend @entity4 was hardly the original plan for the @entity1			1
but after the @entity15 @entity21 candidate @entity20 dropped out , and @entity23 , an independent , began rising in the polls , the group decided to join several others to try to save @entity4 , and potentially a @entity12 takeover of the @entity21			1

it 's a powerful weapon in an election where voters are even more fed up with politics and politicians than usual			0
the @entity1 's ad , which is set to air statewide in @entity6 on broadcast and digital , is trying to crack that image of @entity23 by painting him as just another politician refusing to take positions on key issues , and follows the @entity12 talking point of the last few weeks -- linking @entity23 to president @entity48 and @entity15 in the @entity21			1
it even uses the classic @entity48 campaign logo for the " o " in @entity23			0
@entity23 has donated to @entity15 campaigns including @entity48 's in the past , and said he voted @entity53 too			2
but he has also voted for @entity12 candidates			2
his line is that he tried both parties , and liked neither			0
the ad also whacks @entity23 for refusing to say which party he would caucus with if he were to win the @entity21 seat			0
he has said he would caucus with the majority , but wo n't say what he would do if there is no clear majority and his decision on which party to back would be a deciding factor			0

republicans had hoped to only be defending competitive seats in @entity83 and @entity84 , but @entity4 tarnished image in @entity6 as someone who lost touch stuck with him even after he won a tough @entity12 primary earlier this year .			1

@entity4 sen. @entity4 is in a tough *reelection* fight with an independent candidate .
the @entity53 dropped out of the race because the independent had a better shot at winning .
@entity12 leaning groups have rallied around @entity4 in an attempt to keep the seat .
