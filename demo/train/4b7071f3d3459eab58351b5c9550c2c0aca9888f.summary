@entity0 -- the @entity2 has decided that the family of a slain professional wrestling personality can continue its lawsuit against @entity6 , a case that tested privacy concerns and the competing right to publish " newsworthy " material			1
the justices without comment monday turned aside an appeal from the publishers of the men 's magazine , which featured old nude photos of @entity18 , who was killed nearly three years ago by her husband and fellow wrestling superstar @entity20			1
the couple 's young son also was slain in the family 's @entity25 home			2
the order is a victory for the estate of @entity18 , which is seeking damages from @entity6			1
at issue was whether the constitutional right of privacy indirectly referenced in the 14th @entity35 trumps the @entity35 protections of the media and publishers in this " right - of - publicity " dispute			2
the original lawsuit was brought by @entity42 , whose daughter , @entity18 , had posed nude for a photographer more than two decades ago			1
@entity42 claims that her daughter , who was also known by the wrestling moniker @entity18 , had asked immediately after the shoot to have the photos and video destroyed and believed that photographer @entity50 had done so			1
he later sold stills from the video to @entity6 , a men 's magazine founded by @entity54 that publishes racy material			1
the photos were published in the march 2008 issue			2
the murders had occurred the previous summer			0
at the center of the crimes was @entity20 , a @entity61 - born athlete who worked for several professional wrestling circuits , including the popular @entity63			2
in 2000 , he married @entity18 , a @entity64 native who had become a well - known wrestling manager after her time in the ring			2
their son , @entity67 , was born earlier that year			0
police say the crimes occurred over a three - day period in june 2007 at the @entity72 - area home of the @entity73			0
investigators concluded that @entity20 first bound his 43 - year - old wife and strangled her			2
the 7 - year - old boy was then drugged and strangled			0
the man then committed suicide by hanging himself with a weight machine			0
no formal motive was ever established			0
@entity1 reported at the time that doctors found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of 40 - year - old @entity20 , according to @entity25 's chief medical examiner			1
performance - enhancing anabolic steroids were later found in the home			0
weeks after the killings , a study of @entity20 's brain showed damage from " prior repetitive injury			1
" his father , @entity95 , said on @entity1 's " @entity96 " that a series of concussions from his high - flying moves in the ring were in part to blame			0
@entity25 has a law similar to many states ' recognizing the right to privacy against " the appropriation of another 's name and likeness ... without consent and for the financial gain of the appropriator			0
" that would include " a private citizen , entertainer , or a public figure who is not a public official " like a legislator			0
the state 's high court ruled against @entity6 in june , finding that a " brief biography " of @entity18 and her murder accompanying the nude photos did not represent a " newsworthy article			1
" " the photographs published by [ @entity128 ] neither relate to the incident of public concern conceptually [ the murders ] nor correspond with the time period during which @entity20 was rendered , against her will , the subject of public scrutiny , " the state court wrote			1
" were we to hold otherwise , [ @entity128 ] would be free to publish any nude photograph of almost anyone without their permission , simply because the fact they were caught nude on camera strikes someone as ' newsworthy			0
' surely that debases the very concept of a right to privacy			0
" the state justices said " crude though the concept may seem , " @entity18 's mother is now entitled to control such images " in order to maximize the economic benefit to be derived from her daughter 's posthumous fame			1
" such power is known legally as the " right of publicity			0
" @entity54 and the photographer , @entity50 , later filed the appeal with the @entity165 @entity2 and had the support of several media organizations			1
in a brief filed in support of @entity6 , the @entity168 said the @entity25 ruling " makes no sense , as it goes well beyond the photographs that appear in magazines such as petitioner 's to affect all news - gathering			1
" the group noted that other courts have long recognized a broadly read " newsworthiness " standard for commercial media like @entity1 and that such specific " dissection " of content - based stories and pictorials by judges would cripple editorial decision - making by all news outlets			0
the case is @entity189 ( dba @entity6 ) v. @entity42 , as administrator and personal representative of the estate of @entity193 ( 09 - 625 ) .			2

@entity2 turns aside appeal over @entity18 nude photos
@entity6 published pictures months after @entity20 's husband killed her , son , himself
@entity18 's mother sued , saying daughter thought materials destroyed
case centers on rights of media , privacy
