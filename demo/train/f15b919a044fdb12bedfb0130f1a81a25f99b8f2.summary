-- love him or hate him , @entity1 will always be himself -- especially when he 's burying the hatchet with @entity3			1
the 36 - year - old @entity5 winner appeared on " @entity6 " on wednesday to discuss the feud the two got into a few weeks ago			1
@entity1 and @entity9 : a brief history it all started with @entity3 's parody of @entity15 's recent interview with @entity16 , during which he spoke at length about feeling artistically boxed in and the status of hip - hop as the new rock n ' roll			1
( that 's where @entity1 's now legendary quote , " i 'm the no. 1 rock star on the planet , " came from			1
) @entity3 , who admitted wednesday that he 'd only seen a few portions of @entity15 's viral interview , latched on to the rapper 's reference to leather jogging pants , which he says he invented before they became fashionable			1
for his late - night program on @entity33 , @entity3 re-enacted that portion of the interview with little kids			1
" i wanted to clear this up			2
i really felt bad about all of this stuff , i did , " @entity3 told @entity15			1
" the main reason i did ( the sketch ) is because i like to see kids curse ... most people maybe even think that this is some publicity stunt that we cooked up			2
" but of course , @entity1 does n't do publicity stunts , " period , " he said			1
" everyone out there ... needs to know that i 've never done a publicity stunt in my life			0
anytime i 've went up and spoke my mind , whether it put my career in jeopardy ... it was always what i thought was the truth			0
i do n't follow rules of normal celebrity			0
" in the end , @entity1 explained , @entity3 became a sort of scapegoat for all the other members of the media who 've published " bogus " information			1
@entity1 : i 'm the no. 1 rock star on the planet " a combination of me knowing you , but also , me not knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of @entity75 , i was like , well this is the one person i know , " @entity1 said			1
" so i can go and let out everything that i feel about every single bogus weekly cover , every single bogus skit , every single rumor -- everything that people think is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals , or act like what they 're saying is not serious			0
" @entity1 said his frustration admittedly escalated after his initial phone call with @entity3 about the sketch			1
" it elevates sometimes , " @entity1 said			1
" at a certain point , egos flare up , and we just kind of took it back to high school for a little bit			0
" for @entity3 , it was odd to be in a feud with @entity1 , someone he 's gotten to know well enough where he has found himself defending the artist 's reputation			1
" a lot of times , i think you bring it on yourself , this misunderstanding about you			0
i do n't know if you know this , but a lot of people think you 're a jerk , " @entity3 told @entity15			2
" i often , in my own personal conversations , say , ' no , i know this guy , he is not a jerk			0
' " @entity1 and @entity111 take @entity112 yet to @entity15 , likability is apparently immaterial			2
" i 'm not running for office , i 'm just here to make good music , " @entity1 said			2
" when i did that interview , i was really vocal about a lot of the things that i 've been dealing with over the past 10 years when i was put in the classification of ' just a celebrity			0
' for me , i 'm a creative genius , and there 's no other way to word it			0
i know you 're not supposed to say that about yourself , and i say things the wrong way a lot of times , but my intention is always positive			0
... i want to help the world			0
" @entity3 pointed out those sorts of statements are what critics use against @entity1 , but to him , " to say that i was n't a genius , i would be lying to you and to myself			1
" " i could care less about any of these cameras , in all honesty			0
all i care about is my family , i care about protecting my girl , protecting my baby , and protecting my ideas and my dreams			0
that 's the reason why i went so crazy , " @entity1 said			2
" i 'm totally weird , and i 'm totally honest , and i 'm totally inappropriate sometimes ... i 'm just going to give y'all the truth , and y'all going to learn to love it			0
you 're going to love me , you 're going to hate me , but i 'm going to be me			0
" and since he was sharing his truth , @entity1 told @entity3 that he did find a bit of joy in his profane @entity9 spree			1
" as i was writing it , there was a frustration i was getting out , but also they were really funny to me			0
i just thought it was so amazing that i was saying this in real time with my position , because as soon as you 're a celebrity you 're not allowed to say anything anymore , " @entity1 said , adding with a laugh , " you should 've seen the second set of tweets			2
" @entity3 responded with a laugh , " let 's save them for next time			2
