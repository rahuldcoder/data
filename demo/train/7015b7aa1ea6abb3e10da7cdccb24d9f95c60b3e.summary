what do you call a politician who has close friends running three coordinating super pacs with a stated goal of laying the groundwork for that politician 's presidential campaign ? you might call her @entity9 , candidate for president of the @entity11			1
the lazy , cliche take on how the media are covering @entity9 is that there 's too much of an early focus on someone who has n't declared her intentions			1
while it 's true that the breathless " will she or wo n't she ? " chatter is overkill , the flaw is in the substance			0
the reality is @entity9 is running a campaign for president right now , whether she 'll admit it or not , so she should be held to account by the media and voters the way any other candidate would			1
this week that campaign has taken her to the @entity32 , where she has been giving a series of stump speeches just the way a presidential candidate would -- only she 's getting paid $ 200k a pop. you can see the evidence of her taking advantage of this dichotomy -- letting her allies build a campaign while she avoids the scrutiny -- in her words , actions , and history			1
there are clear incentives for @entity51 to have her cake and eat it too			1
an analysis of her favorability ratings over time shows that she 's always polled the lowest when she 's a candidate and highest when she can " stay above the fray			2
" her allies speculate that her favorability ratings may face a double - digit drop once she becomes an official candidate			1
her @entity64 tenure was marked with the caution of someone eyeing a future campaign			0
according to the new book " @entity69 , " she hired political staff to " keep the @entity51 political network humming at @entity64			1
" her accomplishments were nil , largely because the only major policy risks she took -- a reset in @entity76 and support for the overthrow of former dictator @entity79 in @entity80 -- have become vulnerabilities			0
after over 20 years in @entity83 handing out favors to friends and moving with the political winds , it benefits @entity51 to let some of the more controversial issues play out rather than take a stand now			2
among the vital issues she 's currently taking a pass on are @entity92 spying ( @entity51 planned a speech , canceled it , and has n't spoken in any detail on the subject since ) ; the @entity96 , an issue that her department had jurisdiction over in the @entity101 administration ; and the implementation of @entity103			2
while she avoids these critical issues , she is amassing an army of super pacs unprecedented in their scope			0
they work together -- with a clear division of labor -- to do her political bidding while giving her the cover to be a " private citizen			0
" -- ready for @entity9 is the grass - roots outfit run by longtime @entity51 confidant @entity115 , who has been called an " adopted son " of the @entity117			1
@entity115 told @entity118 that the goal of the organization is " to build the @entity121 of grass - roots operations " for @entity9 to drive when the time is right			1
-- @entity125 's @entity124 is charged with defending @entity51 's record in the media			2
its founder , @entity128 , is a top @entity51 ally			2
the group 's day - to - day operations are run by another @entity131 , @entity132 , who was with @entity51 in 2008 and was tasked with staying on after the campaign to create a " hit list " of political foes , according to " @entity69			1
" -- @entity137 , once president @entity101 's super pac , is run by a who 's who of @entity140 elites with ties to the @entity117 and has committed to handling the big - dollar advertising campaign			2
its board includes executives from both @entity125 and @entity145			0
a spokesman for @entity145 called the groups " a family			0
" so given that she has close friends building a coordinated family of grass - roots , messaging , fund - raising and advertising infrastructure for a campaign , what exactly are we speculating about again ? if @entity9 wants to be treated as a private citizen / celebrity / world traveler who does n't have to answer to voters and the media , she should disavow these pacs and ask her friends to stand down while she makes a decision			1
short of that , she is a presidential candidate and should be treated as such			0
she 's a presidential candidate when she is being paid $ 200,000 to speak by companies that would lobby her administration should she be elected			0
she 's a presidential candidate when she 's traveling the country raising money for the @entity172 from the same donor base that would fund her campaign			0
and she 's a presidential candidate when she 's choosing to avoid taking a stand on issues that might jeopardize her electoral chances			0
so how about we shelve the " will she or wo n't she ? " and replace it with more " does she or does n't she ? " join us on @entity184 / @entity183 .			0

@entity186 says @entity9 is running for president right now whether she 'll admit it or not
she should be held accountable as any other candidate would , he argues
@entity51 is in the middle of a three - state @entity32 trip this week
