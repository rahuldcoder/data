@entity0 wants you to buy its first smartphone , the fire , which it unveiled wednesday			1
but it also wants you to use that phone to buy more stuff ... from @entity0			1
and one of the device 's most distinctive features is designed to make it as easy as possible do just that			2
it 's called @entity12 , and it contains image - , text - and audio - recognition technology to help you scan and identify books , songs , movies and other items			1
@entity0 wants you to use @entity12 so much that the feature has its own dedicated button on the side of the phone for one - stop shopping			1
" @entity12 button lets you identify printed @entity29 and email addresses , phone numbers , @entity31 and bar codes , artwork , and over 100 million items , including songs , movies , tv shows , and products -- and take action in seconds , " @entity0 ceo @entity25 said in announcing the phone , which will run @entity0 's @entity3 operating system			1
for example , you could use the phone 's cameras and sensors to identify an exotic fruit or vegetable , figure out who sings a song on the radio or help send an e-mail to a new contact after scanning their business card			1
well , except for maybe the song			0
once you 've identified the tune , @entity0 wants you to download it			2
@entity25 demonstrated the feature onstage wednesday by using the phone to instantly identify items arrayed on a table , including a book , a cd and a jar of @entity64			1
as with products like its @entity68 e-readers , @entity3 tablets and @entity71 , the fire phone is designed to pull you into @entity0 's growing universe of products and services and then keep you there			1
so with @entity12 , the @entity76 will pop up as the default source to buy that song			2
and that 's also where those @entity31 and bar codes come in			0
@entity12 will make it even easier to pursue a habit that has proliferated in the smartphone age and driven brick - and - mortar stores crazy			2
a user will presumably be able to walk into a store , pick out a product they like , zap it with @entity12 and , within a second or two , find out whether it 's available on @entity0 for less money			1
( and then maybe even order it right there from their phone			0
) according to @entity0 , the @entity12 feature will recognize 70 million products , 35 million songs , 245,000 movies and tv episodes , and 160 live tv channels			1
that 's a lot of chances to spend money			0
the @entity3 also boasts a @entity106 screen			0
it ships july 25 , although you can pre-order it now			0
the phone is available only on @entity113 's network			2
if there 's one difference between the @entity12 - loaded @entity65 and other @entity0 hardware , it 's the price			1
at $ 199 for a @entity120 model and $ 299 for the @entity121 -- with an @entity113 contract -- its cost is comparable with that of other high - end smartphones			0
by comparison , the @entity3 tablet debuted in 2011 at $ 199 , a full $ 300 less than the cheapest ipad 2 at the time			0
the first @entity68 e-reader debuted about $ 400 but quickly dropped in price			0
there are @entity132 that can now be purchased for about $ 70			0
under @entity25 , the company 's strategy has been to sell hardware for less than its competitors , sometimes even at a loss , to get customers using other @entity0 products			2
as such , customers who buy the @entity3 soon will get a free year 's subscription ( normally $ 99 ) to @entity143 , which offers two - day shipping , free streaming on prime instant video and access to the @entity68 book - lending library			0
whether the @entity65 will be an instant hit remains to be seen			0
shoppers may be hesitant to buy a phone online if they ca n't test it out in stores			0
but if @entity0 can carve out a decent piece of the smartphone market , which moved more than 1 billion phones last year , @entity12 may help make sure those @entity0 purchases just keep on coming .			1
