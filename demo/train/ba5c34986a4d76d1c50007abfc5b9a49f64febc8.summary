-- in an abrupt about - face in its mobile software strategy , @entity1 will soon cease developing its @entity5 plug - in for mobile browsers , according to an e-mail sent to @entity1 partners on tuesday evening			1
and with that e-mail flash , @entity1 has signaled that it knows , as @entity13 predicted , the end of the @entity5 era on the web is coming soon			1
the e-mail , obtained and first reported on by @entity15 , says that @entity1 will no longer continue to " adapt @entity5 for mobile devices to new browser , os version or device configurations , " instead focusing on alternative application packaging programs and the @entity22 protocol			1
" our future work with @entity5 on mobile devices will be focused on enabling @entity28 developers to package native apps with @entity30 for all the major app stores , " the quoted e-mail says			2
in the past , @entity1 has released software tools for mobile developers that create a single platform programmers can use to make applications that work across three major mobile platforms : @entity38 , @entity39 and the @entity40 while it 's seemingly easier than learning all of the native languages for each operating system , some developers have claimed a loss in app performance when coding in a non-native language that then gets translated into other languages			2
the move indicates a massive backpedaling on @entity1 's part , a company who championed its flash platform in the face of years of naysaying about its use on mobile devices			1
despite @entity28 's near ubiquity across desktop pcs , many in the greater computing industry , including , famously , @entity57 , have denounced the platform as fundamentally unstable on mobile browsers , and an intense battery drain			1
in effect , @entity28 's drawbacks outweigh the benefits on mobile devices			0
@entity5 became a dominant desktop platform by allowing developers to code interactive games , create animated advertisements and deliver video to any browser that had the plugin installed , without having to take into account the particulars of any given browser			0
however , with the development of @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity22 , which has native support for video , many web developers are turning away from @entity5 , which can be a resource hog even on the most advanced browsers			2
@entity57 made its biggest waves in the case against @entity5 in april of last year , when @entity13 penned a 1,500 - word screed against the controversial platform , describing it as a technology of the past			0
@entity13 and @entity57 disliked the platform so intensely , it has since been barred from use on all @entity39 devices			0
despite attempts to breathe life into @entity5 on other mobile devices -- namely , @entity38 and @entity40 -- @entity1 has failed to deliver a consistently stable version of the platform on a smartphone or tablet			1
in @entity104 's testing of the @entity105 in april , @entity5 use caused the browser to crash on a consistent basis			0
and when @entity5 was supposed to come to tablets with @entity110 's @entity109 , @entity1 was only able to provide an highly unstable @entity112 version of @entity5 to ship with the flagship @entity38 device			2
" @entity1 has lost so much credibility with the community that i 'm hoping they are bought by someone else that can bring some stability and eventually some credibility back to the @entity28 , " wrote software developer @entity114 in a blog post on wednesday morning			0
the drastic reversal in @entity1 's mobile plans comes in the wake of the company cutting 750 jobs on tuesday , a move prompted by what @entity1 labeled " corporate restructuring			1
" an @entity1 representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
