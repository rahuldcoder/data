" @entity12 reacted quickest to @entity33 's headed flick off a corner kick in the fourth minute sunday and @entity1 was mostly comfortable thereafter			1
new keeper @entity35 was indeed rarely tested despite @entity9 having most of the possession , with @entity9 striker @entity37 squandering his team 's top chance in the dying minutes			1
" it is a great win for our belief , " @entity1 manager @entity40 was quoted as saying by the @entity41			2

" there was a minute 's applause for legendary @entity1 manager @entity92 on the eve of what would have been his 100th birthday and the atmosphere seemed to lift the home side			2
@entity33 beat @entity9 defender @entity99 to the ball on the corner and then @entity12 poked it into the net with his head			1
" i just anticipated the header from @entity106 , " said @entity12			2
unable to create much going forward , @entity9 's frustration grew and @entity37 exchanged angry words with @entity109			2
@entity35 was comfortable in keeping out @entity111 's drive in the 77th minute and then @entity37 shot wide -- with his right foot -- from a tight angle off @entity114 's through ball in the 87th			0

while @entity122 has made seven signings this summer in anticipation of @entity123 's probable transfer to @entity142 , @entity121 has merely brought in two free transfers even with ample funds available			1
