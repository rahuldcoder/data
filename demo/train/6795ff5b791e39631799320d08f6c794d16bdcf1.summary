@entity0 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 called on @entity4 to reconsider plans to build thousands of homes in its occupied territory , saying it will set back efforts to bring about a two - state solution between the @entity4 and @entity12			1
@entity14 's comments friday followed news that @entity4 prime minister @entity16 authorized the construction of the new homes , a move widely viewed as retaliatory after the @entity12 won a @entity22 bid to recognize their claim to become a " non-member observer state			2
" " in light of today 's announcement , let me reiterate that this administration â € ” like previous administrations â € ” has been very clear with @entity4 that these activities set back the cause of a negotiated peace , " @entity14 said in remarks delivered at the @entity26 in @entity0			1
@entity16 has not publicly acknowledged the approval of the new construction			0
but a senior government official said saturday that the prime minister signed off on building " 3,000 housing units " in the @entity38 as well as authorizing planning and zoning for future construction in the @entity43 town of @entity44			1
" this makes operational plans that were on the table , " said the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject matter			0
@entity14 did not refer to any specific settlement in her remarks			0
but the @entity58 administration has repeatedly warned @entity4 against settling @entity38 and the @entity43 , particularly the @entity44 area , because it would make it nearly impossible to create a contiguous @entity12			1
@entity61 also called on @entity4 to reverse its decision to build housing in the @entity43 and @entity38			1
" @entity4 settlements are illegal under international law and undermine trust between the parties , " foreign secretary @entity64 said in a statement			1
" if implemented , these plans would alter the situation on the ground on a scale that makes the two state solution , with @entity38 as a shared capital , increasingly difficult to achieve			2
they would undermine @entity4 's international reputation and create doubts about its stated commitment to achieving peace with the @entity12			2
" @entity4 seized the @entity43 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 during the 1967 war			2
the @entity83 has since been returned to @entity85			0
@entity4 annexed the @entity82 in 1981 , a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by @entity88 , which still claims the land			2
the more militant @entity12 group @entity90 now controls @entity81 , while the moderate group @entity91 -- headed by president @entity92 -- administers the @entity43 , site of a growing number of @entity4 settlements			1
ultimately , the @entity12 are aiming to unite @entity81 and the @entity43 under the authority of a new state with the capital of @entity38			1
the @entity3 was opposed to @entity12 efforts to gain recognition by the @entity22 as a " non-member state , " warning that such a move might cause @entity4 to react			1
" @entity12 leaders need to ask themselves what unilateral action can really accomplish for their people			0
president @entity92 took a step in the wrong direction this week , to say the least			0
we opposed his resolution , " @entity14 said			0
" but we also need to see that the @entity110 in the @entity43 still offers the most compelling alternative to rockets and permanent resistance			0
at a time when religious extremists claim to offer rewards in the hereafter , @entity4 needs to help those committed to peace to deliver for their people in the here and now			2
" @entity12 officials have refused to enter into new talks with @entity4 until it stops building settlements on @entity43 land			1
@entity16 , meanwhile , has said there can be no preconditions on talks			0
the @entity12 bid to the @entity22 and news of @entity4 settlement construction came just days after a cease - fire took hold between @entity4 and @entity90 that brought about an end to a series of @entity4 military airstrikes against @entity81 launched in an effort to stop @entity90 rocket attacks			1
@entity14 called on @entity85 to use its " unique relationship " with @entity90 to make clear it opposes any escalation of tensions			0
" we look to @entity85 to intensify its efforts to crack down on weapons smuggling from @entity145 and @entity146 into @entity147 € ” and i am concerned that , if more rockets are allowed to enter @entity81 through the tunnels , that will pave the way to more fighting again soon , " she said			0
@entity1 's @entity154 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 's @entity155 from @entity156 and @entity1 's @entity157 from @entity38 .			0
