-- before they can bask in glory , @entity2 runners on monday will first bake in abnormally high temperatures -- so warm , in fact , that race organizers are taking several steps to warn participants and allow those concerned about the heat to instead run next year			1
the race , which began in 1897 and bills itself as the world 's oldest annually contested marathon , is typically held in relatively cool weather			1
the average temperature for an april day in @entity15 is 47 degrees -- with a usual high of 56 and low typically of 40 degrees -- according to the city and @entity20			1
still , with its rolling hills , the @entity21 - to - @entity15 course is often considered among the nation 's most grueling marathons even in ideal racing conditions , which usually imply temperatures in this same 40s and 50s range , light winds and cloudy skies			0
dangerous weather from @entity32 to @entity33 but that 's far from what runners will encounter this year			0
monday 's forecast from the @entity20 calls for sunny skies and a high temperature of 88 degrees , with sustained winds blowing out of the southwest at between 7 and 15 mph			1
for this reason , the @entity42 has taken the unusual step of urging even very fit participants to " run at a slower pace " and " frequently take breaks			1
" " this will not be a day to run a personal best , " the race organizer said in its online statement			1
" if you choose to run , run safely above all else			0
" the @entity42 also recommended that those who are " not highly fit " or who have " any underlying medical conditions " not run , even if they have a much sought after bib number			0
besides elite runners , people can get a spot in the @entity2 by qualifying based on their time in another marathon or getting a position as part of an effort to raise funds for charity			2
to that end , the association announced last week that any official entrants in the 2012 race can defer and instead run in the 2013 @entity2			1
those taking up this option do n't have their entry fee refunded but simply reserve a spot in next year 's race			2
the hot weather forecast early this week is exceptional for @entity15 , though it 's in line with the trend that has been building over the first few months of this year			2
the average temperature in @entity15 from january through march was 39.4 degrees , the warmest recorded for that time stretch , the weather service reports			0
two runners died while participating in november 's @entity87 , the race 's executive @entity84 said			0
but weather there was not believed to be a factor , as there were cool temperatures , light winds and most cloudy skies throughout the race			0
that same month , a 30 - year - old male runner at the @entity97 collapsed with cardiac arrest and was transported to @entity99 .			0

the @entity2 , the world 's oldest such race , will be held monday
the high temperature is forecast for 88 degrees ; the april norm is 56 degrees
race organizers urge participants to " run at a slower pace " and take breaks
