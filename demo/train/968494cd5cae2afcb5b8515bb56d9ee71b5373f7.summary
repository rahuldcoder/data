@entity2 was under " the delusional belief that he was being controlled or influenced by extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves " before he embarked on a bloody shooting rampage at the @entity8 , an @entity1 official said wednesday			1
the 34 - year - old contractor , who until a few years ago had served in the @entity10 , spelled out this belief -- with the words , " my @entity17 weapon " -- in the sawed - off @entity13 shotgun he brought into the military facility 's @entity14 on the morning of september 16			1
" @entity17 " refers to low - frequency electromagnetic waves , a technology used for submarine communications that conspiracy theorists believe the government employs to monitor and manipulate unsuspecting citizens , the @entity1 said			1
" ultra low frequency attack is what i 've been subject to for the last 3 months , " read a message obtained by federal authorities from @entity2 's thumb drives , phones and computers			1
" and to be perfectly honest , that is what has driven me to this			0
" " this " is the incident that left the @entity10 , @entity35 and the nation in shock			0
@entity2 was quickly tabbed as the shooter			1
still , big questions loomed as to why he did it , as well as whether he 'd gotten help or told anyone about his plans			0
@entity45 , assistant director in charge of the @entity1 's @entity35 field office , stated unequivocally wednesday " the investigation has determined that @entity2 acted alone			1
" asked whether he talked to or e-mailed anyone ahead of the attack , @entity45 responded simply : " no. " the public also got the first chance wednesday to see @entity2 in action that day , through surveillance video and photos			1
they start with @entity2 driving his rented blue @entity57 , with @entity59 plates , around 7:53 a.m. into a parking garage , and then 15 minutes later carrying a backpack into @entity14			1
a still photo , taken afterward , shows that backpack hung on the inside wall of a fourth - floor bathroom stall -- where he 'd put his shotgun together , authorities say			1
the most chilling footage shows @entity2 , dressed in a short - sleeve polo shirt and pants , prowling the building 's halls and stairwells			1
most of the time , his gun is cocked -- ready to fire			0
@entity2 went on to kill 12 people that day and wound four others			1
the same shotgun on which he had written " my @entity17 " contained other etchings as well			0
the words : " end to the torment ! " " not what y'all say ! " and " better off this way ! " at some point during his rampage , @entity2 picked up a @entity89 handgun			1
he exchanged gunfire with law enforcement officers a few times during the more than hourlong ordeal , which ended at 9:25 a.m. with @entity2 shot dead on the third floor			1
@entity2 had arrived in the capital area on august 25 for a contracting project , a few weeks after he told police in @entity97 , @entity98 , that he 'd heard " voices " emanating from the walls of hotels he 'd been staying at			2
once in @entity35 , he stayed at two suburban hotels before settling into a @entity103 in the city on september 7			0
two days later , @entity2 began his contracting job based at the @entity8			2
on the first saturday after that , he was at a @entity108 shooting range and gun store -- where he purchased the @entity13			0
flags in shooter 's past apparently not red enough @entity1 : shooter did not target specific victims a manager raised a performance - related issue with @entity2 the previous friday , but @entity45 said that there is no indication this incident spurred any notable reaction			1
in fact , when he began shooting , it appears he was n't picky about his victims			0
" we have not determined there to be any previous relationship between @entity2 and any of the victims , " the @entity1 official said			1
with his contractor status -- not to mention he was a former @entity10 reservist -- few questioned that @entity2 legitimately gained access to the @entity8 the morning of the fateful shooting			2
still , some have asked whether he should have had such access , given his mental health and criminal history			0
tackling the military 's insider threat the latter includes a 2004 arrest in @entity141 , when he was accused of shooting the tires of a man 's truck in an anger - fueled " blackout , " according to a police report			0
@entity2 ' father told police his son had anger management problems associated with post-traumatic stress disorder , which he suffered after working " as an active participant in rescue attempts " during the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in @entity59			2
another arrest came in august 2008 in @entity157 , @entity158 , on a disorderly conduct charge			0
two years later , @entity2 was arrested in @entity160 , @entity161 -- but never charged -- over an allegation that he fired a gun through the ceiling of his apartment			2
that was the year , 2010 , that the @entity10 moved to discharge @entity2 due to what military officials described as a " pattern of misconduct " including insubordination , disorderly conduct , unauthorized absences from work and at least one instance of drunkenness			2
but due to a lack of evidence , he was instead given an honorable discharge			0
then there was his mental state , including last month 's incident in @entity97 , @entity98			0
@entity2 also sought help at two @entity184 hospitals in and around @entity35 for sleep - related issues , according to law enforcement sources			1
who were the victims ? @entity189 drops subcontractor @entity2 worked for despite all this , @entity2 still managed to find work at the experts for about six months over the past year			1
that company said the last of two background checks it conducted in june on @entity2 " revealed no issues other than one minor traffic violation			2
" like the military , the experts has come under criticism for not recognizing @entity2 as a potential problem or threat			1
a @entity189 spokesman told @entity204 on wednesday the technology company -- citing its policy of adhering " to the highest standards of business practices and ethics " -- had dropped the experts as a subcontractor			1
" based on what we now know about the experts ' conduct , including its failure to respond appropriately to @entity2 ' mental health issues and certain incidents recently reported in the press , @entity189 has terminated its relationship with the experts , " the spokesman said			1
the experts responded , in a statement , saying it was " disappointed ' by @entity189 's decision and insisting it has met " all of our contractual obligations			1
" " the experts had no greater insight into @entity2 ' mental health than @entity189 , particularly given that an @entity189 site manager closely supervised him , including during the events in @entity98 , " the company said			1
1 dead in @entity231 workplace shooting @entity1 takes heat over video release the @entity1 was criticized wednesday night , both by @entity235 officials and victims ' families following the release of the video			2
" people in @entity235 are furious that @entity1 and other law enforcement officials unnecessarily put out this video footage today			2
it only adds to the pain of the families and brought life back to a killer , " a senior @entity235 official told @entity204			0
" outside of law enforcement channels , the video was not viewed			0
" another @entity235 official described the release as " gratuitous , " indicating there was nothing to be gained from the release			0
law enforcement officials said they reached all but one of the victims ' families to inform them beforehand			0
and officials at the @entity1 argued that the video clarified various conflicting reports about the timeline of events , and would help to dispel various pieces of misinformation , including one incorrect story that the shooter was looking for specific victims			2
@entity269 , assistant director of the @entity1 's @entity270 , said what was released was a far less painful version of the graphic video collected by authorities			2
@entity10 leadership said that while officials knew the footage would be released , they were not told of the content			0
it is not known if anyone in @entity235 leadership had expressed their views with the @entity1 or @entity285			0
sources also told @entity204 that the @entity287 , an arm of the @entity10 , was part of the decision regarding the distribution of the video , and saw the footage before it was released			0
one victims ' family reacted with equal dismay			0
" i 'm in total shock after reviewing the video			0
we have not even had time to begin to grieve , " @entity298 told @entity204 wednesday evening , saying his family did not know the @entity1 was about to release the video			0
his sister - in - law , @entity302 , was one of the 12 killed by @entity2			1
@entity10 did not know that 2004 @entity2 arrest involved gun			0

citing its business ethics , @entity189 drops @entity2 ' employer , the experts
the experts says it is disappointed , met all of its obligations
@entity1 : @entity2 acted alone and was n't targeting anyone in particular
he used a sawed - off shotgun that was etched ' end to the torment '
