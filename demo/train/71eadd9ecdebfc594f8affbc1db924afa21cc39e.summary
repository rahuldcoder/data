-- it 's one of the great ironies in all of sports : pro baseball 's career hitting leader is not in baseball 's @entity7			1
as long as @entity9 is banned from baseball , he will be banned from any @entity7 ballot			1
on monday , 20 years to the day @entity9 signed an agreement with @entity13 banning him from the sport , he is no closer to being reinstated			1
in that agreement , @entity18 , accused of betting on @entity13 games while he managed the @entity21 , was " declared permanently ineligible in accordance with @entity16			1
" @entity18 did n't publicly admit the betting until this decade			1
baseball 's history , @entity18 's lying about his gambling and his brash nature in handling the manner have all painted him into this corner , with no apparent way out			1
" nobody who has ever been thrown out of baseball has ever been reinstated			2
an owner of @entity38 bet on baseball , the 1919 @entity35 , you name it			2
no matter if it 's a third - base coach or an all - star , @entity7 - type player , " said @entity41 , who was @entity13 deputy commissioner at the time baseball investigated @entity18 for betting on his team			1
@entity48 , who talked to @entity0 from his summer home in @entity50 , @entity51 , wrote the agreement in 1989			2
it was signed by then - @entity13 commissioner @entity55 @entity54 , @entity18 and his attorneys , and @entity48			1
" i think the door is closed			0
there is no possible way they can retract what was done , " said @entity59 , longtime columnist for @entity60 and a voting member of the @entity7 's @entity62			1
" every club has it as you walk into their clubhouse in big letters : no gambling			0
" i think @entity54 handled it beautifully			0
he was banned for life , and that should be the last line of his career			0
" last month , it took one comment about baseball 's hit king from baseball 's former home run king to reignite the controversy			1
" i would certainly like to see him in , " @entity85 told reporters at baseball 's @entity7 festivities			1
" he belongs in , really			0
" at first , many observers thought those remarks were a big move in favor of @entity18 , as @entity85 is a longtime friend of @entity13 commissioner @entity94			1
@entity7 pitcher @entity95 later told the @entity96 , " i heard what @entity85 said about it , and that 's a cockamamie idea			0
i had dinner with the commissioner sunday , and he did n't like it			0
" @entity59 , who has covered @entity85 his whole career , said he " could n't believe @entity85 said it			0
" " sometimes @entity104 wants to be likable and is kind to some people , " @entity59 said			0
this weekend , another friend , hall of famer @entity107 , went to @entity18 's defense , in a column he wrote for @entity111			1
" is this the way @entity54 would have wanted it 20 years later ? " @entity107 asked			1
@entity107 maintains @entity54 was the only man who could broker @entity18 back into the sport 's good graces : " @entity54 was a compassionate man who would have eventually met with him , laid out a lifestyle plan that @entity9 would follow , and today he 'd be a forgiven member of baseball 's family			1
" @entity107 points to baseball 's current steroids scandal as another reason for @entity18 's ban to be lifted			1
" which is worse ? does the penalty fit the crime ? " @entity107 wrote			0
a @entity130 / @entity129 poll released this week showed that 75 percent of more than 1,000 @entity131 surveyed think that player use of performance - enhancing drugs is more serious than @entity18 's offense			1
the same poll showed that support for @entity138 eligibility has not changed in 20 years -- 60 percent favor it ; 35 percent are opposed			1
@entity54 's successor , @entity48 , said @entity18 prevented himself from ever getting considered for a possible return to baseball			1
" he and his lawyers said all kinds of things about @entity54 , claiming @entity54 was biased and all , " @entity48 said			0
" the proper course for @entity9 would be to say then , ' i 'm sorry , i want to help you , i want to help baseball			1
' but he never did that , of course			0
" @entity54 and i told him about reconfiguring his life , and that 's the sad part			0
he was very defiant then , and he made it more difficult for himself			0
" @entity54 died eight days after banishing @entity18			2
@entity48 took over as commissioner , and he said he never saw any signs of change or remorse from @entity18			2
" i understood very quickly @entity18 had no intention of making changes , " @entity48 said			2
" he never acknowledged he had a gambling problem			0
i do n't think to this day he ever recognized he had a problem			0
" @entity18 made matters worse as the years went on			1
on the weekend of @entity7 inductions in @entity163 , @entity164 , he often held autograph sessions at a nearby bookstore , rankling the @entity167 who played before @entity18			2
from the time of the ban until 2004 , he publicly insisted he did n't bet on baseball			1
when he did admit to betting on baseball in his 2004 book , he was back in @entity163 on the weekend of inductions , signing copies			1
" if you talk to some of the @entity167 , like @entity95 and others , they would never go for that			0
@entity95 has said to me before , ' if @entity9 is allowed in the @entity7 , i 'll never come back , ' " @entity48 said			2
@entity18 and attorneys who once represented him did not return calls and e-mails for comment			2
he makes a living making public appearances and signing autographs , through his web site and at one of the shopping malls at @entity190 in @entity191 , @entity192			0
he has a message for his fans on his web site : " i begrudgingly do not have any positive new updates as it relates to my quest for official re-instatement back into @entity13			2
" @entity107 is one of the few @entity18 supporters who will publicly say baseball should lift the ban			1
@entity18 's ex-teammates @entity203 and @entity204 did not return calls and e-mails			1
like @entity85 , both are on the @entity7 's @entity62			0
so are @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , who would not comment on @entity18 's status			1
" some other players like @entity107 , from time to time , come out and comment that it is time for @entity9 to be reinstated , " @entity48 said			2
" but when you talk to players , they seldom see the universe the way a commissioner sees it			0
for every player that thinks @entity18 should be reinstated , there are 10 that do n't			1
" @entity85 's and @entity107 's comments may be the last talk of @entity18 entering the @entity7 anytime soon , especially during the reign of @entity94 , who has a contract as commissioner through 2012			1
when contacted , a spokesman for @entity94 said , " the commissioner stands by his comments to reporters he made during [ last month 's ] @entity7 weekend , as judge and jury on this			0
" @entity94 said then , " i would remind you that @entity9 admitted to gambling on baseball and agreed to a lifetime ban			1
" he added the case is always under review , but nothing has changed			0
@entity18 does have hometown support			2
in a recent unscientific sampling of readers ' views on the @entity248 's web site that included 5,000 responses , 89 percent said @entity18 should be allowed in the @entity7			1
this weekend , for the second time in the past month , an @entity248 columnist wrote that it is time to forgive @entity18			2
" he has his fans in @entity254 , no doubt ; he has people who want to forgive him , " said @entity59 , @entity60 columnist			0
" but if you robbed a bank , you still robbed a bank			0
it 's done , and nothing you do can change that			0
" @entity48 recalled a conversation he had with @entity167 @entity264			0
" @entity264 once asked me , ' if i 'm a @entity167 , and i bet on baseball , do i get the same treatment ? ' i said , ' yes			0
' @entity264 said , ' i get it			0
if you did n't do that , we would all bet on baseball			2
' " and the @entity274 , baseball 's 225 - page account of the investigation of @entity18 's gambling activities -- including bank and telephone records , @entity18 's betting slips and witness testimony -- has stood the test of time			1
" not a single fact has ever been challenged , " @entity48 said			0
" the case was so overwhelming , and it had so much			0
some people tried to write books on it and could n't because it did n't miss a thing			0
" @entity18 is n't entirely missing from the @entity7			2
his hitting accomplishments and some artifacts are a part of the sport 's timeline there , but so is his lifetime suspension			0
" many artifacts donated by him are on display , " said @entity298 , @entity7 's senior director for communications and education			0
" as a history museum that tracks the game 's greatest moments , @entity9 is noted several times in the museum 's timeline ... but as a history museum , we do have the responsibility to tell the history of baseball			1
we do say @entity9 was banned from baseball for gambling in that timeline			2
" @entity18 holds 19 @entity13 records , including most career hits , 4,256			1
he is the only player in @entity13 history to play more than 500 games at five different positions , and he played in more wins than any player in history			2
one of the roads buffering the @entity327 , the current home of the @entity21 , is @entity9 's way , and it was there back when he was playing near the same site , at @entity331			1
but he is n't going to get his way on the @entity7 anytime soon and may never find the road leading there .			0

@entity9 signed agreement with @entity13 banning him 20 years *ago*
@entity18 accused of betting on games while managing the @entity21
baseball 's hit king did n't publicly admit the betting until 2004
