-- if it was left up to @entity3 , he 'd be at home changing diapers instead of defending his @entity7 title this week			1
ahead of thursday 's opening round at the @entity9 , reigning champ @entity3 admitted he 'd rather be caring for his adopted baby boy @entity10 than on the green at @entity12			1
in fact , the 33 - year - old @entity13 champion is so unconcerned with his golfing triumphs , he has n't even touched the coveted green jacket won in @entity17 earlier this month			1
well , only to post a picture of it on @entity20 hanging next to @entity10 's identical tiny outfit			2
" truthfully , i have n't thought about being a major champ , " he told reporters			0
just over a month after adopting @entity10 with wife @entity25 , the devout @entity24 insisted : " it 's all about my son and being a better husband			1
" i have n't seen the green jacket , the green jacket 's been hanging in the closet since the wednesday of all the media stuff so i have n't touched it since then			1
i held the baby jacket right up next to it for the @entity20 photo but i have n't touched it , i have n't thought about winning			1
" but with money raised from the @entity37 ! @entity38 throughout the tournament going towards helping rebuild a city still struggling in the aftermath of 2005 's @entity42 , big - hearted @entity3 admitted the @entity9 was simply too important an event to miss. plus there 's the fans who will be hoping to catch a glimpse of the reigning champ hitting the type of miraculous shot that won him the trophy in @entity17			1
@entity3 burst into tears after escaping out of woods on the 10th fairway in a playoff against @entity56 's @entity55			1
but despite bawling on his mother 's shoulder in front of the media scrum , @entity3 insists he is unfazed by his wins			1
at @entity7 , there are more important things at stake			2
" i thought about coming here because i owed it to the fans being the defending champion , " he said			2
" winning a tournament , no matter if it 's a major or not , it 's a big deal , it 's a major event for that city as it is about raising charity dollars -- especially round this place			2
they would love some charity dollars to build the city back up to where it used to be			0
" fresh from the media whirlwind that has surrounded him since taking the masters , @entity3 played up to his " average joe " appeal			1
" i 'm just @entity3 from @entity83 , @entity84 , " he said			2
play golf because it 's fun			0
some days it 's windy , some days it 's not , some days the ground is firm , some days it 's wet			0
you wake up , it 's always a challenge			0
so you always challenge yourself , you always set goals for yourself , " he said			0
" i think that resonates -- that 's a big word , there -- with everybody			0
it resonates with everybody because i 'm from a small town , i played public golf courses growing up , and i think that everybody can see that			0
" everybody can see that my swing is homegrown			0
that means everybody has a chance to do it			0
hard work , dedication , practice and the drive to do it and not worry about what other people say			0
