-- most flowers start as seeds planted in soil , but @entity4 , currently a post-doc researcher at @entity6 , prefers to craft bouquets using @entity9 carbonate and sodium metasilicate			1
the two chemicals are disolved in a glass beaker filled with water and as carbon dioxide seeps into the vessel it kickstarts a chemical reaction that creates a wonderland of micro-sculptures that are about the diameter of the human hair			1
after giving the chemical reaction a few hours to bloom , @entity4 slides the sample into an electron microscope where hundreds of thousands of flower - shaped sculptures have blossomed			1
" when zooming in using an electron microscope , you see that inside the beaker a vast landscape of complex sculpted microstructures has evolved in which you can get completely lost , " says @entity26			0
" it really feels like you are diving in a sort of alien coral reef			0
" fascinating ways people try to leave their mark on the world sculpting might be too strong a word , but @entity4 has become increasingly adept at controlling the outcome of his experiments by carefully manipulating variables			2
altering the temperature of the beaker by submerging it in an ice bath , adding drops of acid to control the @entity52 , or even adding a pinch of table salt can lead to vastly different results			2
increasing carbon dioxide levels leads to expansive , leafy crystals while changing the ph level results in rosette structures			0
beyond being the kind of gift that would set @entity64 's heart afire , @entity4 's nano - sized nosegays have serious applications in materials science research			1
microfabrication techniques that build objects at impossible small scale have seen tremendous gains over the last decade , but researchers are bumping up against limits at molecular and nanoscales			0
@entity4 believes this low - tech , biology - based growth approach could ultimately lead to breakthroughs in optical materials and other applications			1
for those interested in the science behind @entity4 's @entity83 res , his research has been published in prestigious journals , though his most important peer - review comes from his lady friend			1
" over the years my girlfriend has indeed received many pictures of the flowers , " he says			2
" i took thousands of pictures and would send the best ones to her			0

@entity4 creates tiny sculptures through a chemical reaction
he carefully manipulates variables to control the shapes which look like flowers
@entity4 's nano - size bouquets also have serious applications in materials science research
