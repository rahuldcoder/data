-- when the @entity2 decided last week to delay the deployment of aircraft carrier @entity4 to the @entity6 because of looming budget cuts , some military families found their already unpredictable lives thrown into even more uncertainty , victims of the ugly budget battle in @entity12			1
one military wife , @entity13 , said she heard on the news , rather than from the @entity15 , that her husband 's deployment was canceled just days before he was set to leave on the @entity4			1
" i never thought @entity12 ' inability to pass a budget would so intimately affect my personal life , " she said			1
she and her husband had plannedthe adoption of a baby to coincide with the time he would be home ; now , those plans are in peril as her ensign husband faces a new schedule that will probably interrupt the proceedings			2
" it is n't right , " wrote @entity15 wife @entity31 on her blog			2
" i know that this whole thing comes down to the one thing that runs the world : money			0
and i know it is completely naive of me to think that families would come first			2
but this kind of emotional whiplash takes a toll			0
" all military families are living under the shadow of upcoming sequestration budget cuts			1
although we hear congressional leaders extol their support for military families -- they even wear their alleged patriotism on their smart striped suits -- it 's clear from inaction on the budget that their support is as empty as the @entity4 's deck			1
@entity57 warns of degraded military readiness from cuts you see , not a lot of @entity62 serve in the military ; it 's only a tiny slice of the pie			1
according to a @entity68 study , about one - half of 1 % of @entity62 adults have served on active duty at any given time in the past decade			0
so when the wind dies down and the flags stop flapping , military families are truly forgotten			1
we are no longer " special " interests			0
a bit of @entity75 : when legislators raised the debt ceiling in 2011 but could n't agree on a deficit - cutting plan , they passed the @entity80 , which called for huge automatic spending cuts -- or sequestration -- to start in january 2013 unless a plan for balancing the budget was drawn up			1
if nothing changes , $ 1.2 trillion in automatic defense and nondefense spending cuts , divided evenly , will kick in over the next 10 years			1
on military installations across the @entity62 and around the world , operations have been hurt			2
troops and brass are waiting for the ax to fall			1
commanders are paralyzed , unable to schedule training or order equipment because they do n't know their budgets			0
troops preparing for combat deployments are n't getting the training that is essential for them to survive their missions			2
service members in @entity104 are already seeing the effects of anticipated budget cuts in everything from the equipment they are issued , or not issued , to the hours the chow halls are open			0
we do n't know what will happen to funding for the programs designed to tackle this war 's ugly twins , post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury , not to mention the rising suicide epidemic among veterans and military family members			1
the fact is , we are losing about 22 veterans to suicide every day , with no evidence that the deadly tide is retreating			0
by the @entity127 : recent defense spending military pay is exempt from sequestration cuts , but pay raises are n't			1
secretary of defense @entity57 will also ask @entity12 to limit next year 's military pay increase to just 1 % , even though the @entity135 's expected @entity134 for 2014 is higher			1
translation : an effective pay cut			0
@entity12 , it seems , is banking on our patriotism once again			2
they are taking for granted that the less than 1 % who responded after the worst terrorist attacks in our nation 's history -- and then responded again by staying in the fight for 11 years and counting -- will respond yet again by standing by stoically			2
we understand that sacrifice is required of everyone in order to reduce our national debt , but the sacrifice should be shared by all			0
we can not perpetuate this fiscal mess			0
so this time around , we will pour our hearts and souls into compelling government leaders to feel , if only for a moment , what playing politics with people like @entity13 truly means			0
military families will take to social media to write , tweet and post about the fiscal cliff 's dangerous slide			1
they will write their members of @entity12 to remind them that relying on 1 % of @entity62 to shoulder a nation 's burden is preposterous			1
and do n't think our problems do n't really affect most @entity62			0
according to @entity57 , " rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts , we would have the smallest ground force since 1940 , the smallest number of ships since 1915 , and the smallest @entity170 in ... history			0
" @entity62 will be more vulnerable to emerging threats than ever , and with less training and equipment to respond			0
in other words , when the wolves come back to our door , there will be fewer , and noticeably weaker , dogs to keep them at bay			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0
