-- dear park visitors , please do n't take selfies with bears			2
@entity5 , the @entity6 that pretty much sums up a warning issued recently by wildlife officials at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
" bears are unpredictable , wild animals and may attack if threatened , " @entity14 supervisor @entity13 said in a statement			0
" we ca n't have visitors creating dangerous situations for themselves and others			0
people are risking serious injury or death if they get too close to a bear			0
" and if you do n't care about your own health , at least consider the bears			0
if one attacked , officials would have to capture and kill it			0
black bears tend to swarm @entity10 this time of year thanks to an annual run of kokanee salmon , according to @entity35			1
and @entity10 staff say they are " routinely " seeing people getting friendly with the animals in an effort to update their @entity41 feed			2
if park visitors continue to ignore instructions and venture too close to the bears to take photos and videos , @entity10 may be closed to the public , the @entity6 said			1
but as these photos show , @entity10 is n't the only place people are taking # bearselfies :			1

@entity6 says visitors are getting too close to bears to take photos , videos
black bears swarm @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , this time of year
if the # bearselfie trend continues , wildlife officials may have to close @entity10
