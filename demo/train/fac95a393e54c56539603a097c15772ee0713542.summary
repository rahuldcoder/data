@entity0 -- in another dramatic victory for firearm owners , the @entity2 has ruled unconstitutional @entity5 , @entity6 ' , 28 - year - old strict ban on handgun ownership , a potentially far - reaching case over the ability of state and local governments to enforce limits on weapons			1
a 5 - 4 conservative majority of justices on monday reiterated its 2 - year - old conclusion that the @entity18 gives individuals equal or greater power than states on the issue of possession of certain firearms for self - protection			1
" it can not be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee , not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as states legislated in an evenhanded manner , " wrote justice @entity26			0
the court grounded that right in the due process section of the 14th amendment			1
the justices , however , said local jurisdictions still retain the flexibility to preserve some " reasonable " gun - control measures currently in place nationwide			1
in dissent , justice @entity42 predicated far - reaching implications			2
" incorporating the right , " he wrote , " may change the law in many of the 50 states			0
read in the majority 's favor , the historical evidence " for the decision " is at most ambiguous			1
" he was supported by justices @entity54 , @entity56 and @entity57			0
at issue was whether the constitutional " right of the people to keep and bear arms " applies to local gun control ordinances , or only to federal restrictions			1
the basic question had remained unanswered for decades , and gave the conservative majority on the high court another chance to allow @entity69 expanded weapon ownership rights			1
a key question was how far the court would apply competing parts of the 14th amendment to preserve some " reasonable " gun control measures currently in place nationwide			1
the appeal was filed by a community activist in @entity5 who sought a handgun for protection from gangs			2
@entity81 told @entity1 outside his @entity83 home that he wants a handgun to protect himself and his family from the violence in his neighborhood			2
" that 's all i want , is just a fighting chance , " he said			2
" give me the opportunity to at least make somebody think about something before they come in my house on me			0
" his application for a handgun permit was denied in a city with perhaps the toughest private weapons restrictions in the nation			2
the justices two years ago affirmed an individual 's right to possess such weapons , tossing out restrictive laws in the federal enclave of the @entity0			1
the larger issue is one that has polarized judges , politicians and the public for decades : do the @entity114 's 27 words bestow gun ownership as an individual right or as a collective one -- aimed at the civic responsibilities of state militias and therefore subject , perhaps , to strict government regulation ? and is that regulation limited to federal laws , or can it be applied to local communities ? the amendment states : " a well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed			1
" gun rights groups applauded the decision			1
" today marks a great moment in @entity69 history , " said @entity133 of the @entity134			1
" it is a vindication for the great majority of @entity69 citizens who have always believed the @entity114 was an individual right and freedom worth defending			1
" some gun control advocates tried to put a positive spin on the opinion			1
" there is nothing in today 's decision that should prevent any state or local government from successfully defending , maintaining , or passing , sensible , strong gun laws , " said @entity145 , of the @entity146			1
the court majority refused to limit its 2008 @entity0 ruling			1
that decision offered at least partial constitutional validation to citizens seeking the right to possess one of the most common types of firearms in their homes			2
the @entity5 ruling now extends that right significantly			0
the @entity164 estimates that as many as 275 million guns are in the @entity69			2
in 2005 , three - quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns			2
underpinning the legal basis for the court 's jurisdiction in this appeal is a complex reading of the 14th amendment , passed after the @entity176 to ensure that all citizens -- including newly freed slaves -- were protected from state laws that might restrict their fundamental rights			1
one part ensures that states can not deprive people of " life , liberty , or property , without due process of law			1
" that has been commonly applied by federal courts when it comes to disputes over basic rights , so - called " ordered liberty " cases			0
such cases include affirming the right to abortion , and to homosexual sex			0
but another rarely used provision also prevents states from depriving the " privileges or immunities " of all citizens			0
the specific question for the high court in the @entity5 case was whether the " immunities and privileges " clause should be used to overturn the handgun ban			0
an 1873 ruling limited use of that provision when considering a variety of state laws			0
@entity218 's lawyer , @entity217 , promoted a new reading of the clause , in his lead role representing gun owners			2
the constitutional theories are dense , but some legal scholars had said that if the high court embraced this " privileges and immunities " clause , it could open up to fresh review a huge range of issues , like property rights and gay marriage			0
courts have generally upheld other cities ' restrictions on semiautomatic weapons and sawed - off shotguns			0
the conservative high court majority has in recent years upheld a @entity242 ban on assault rifles , similar to a federal ban that expired in 2004			0
forty - four state constitutions protect their residents ' right to keep weapons , according to a brief filed by 32 state attorneys general in support of the individual weapons owners in the current appeals			0
some constitutional experts have noted the @entity255 had traditionally been applied by courts only to the federal government , not to local entities			0
it was not until the past half - century that the justices have viewed free speech , assembly , and the press -- among other rights -- as individual in nature , and fundamental to liberty , superseding in many cases the power of states			0
the high court has repeatedly refused to extend to states the 5th @entity114 requirement that persons can be charged with serious crimes only by " indictment of a grand jury			0
" the current case was @entity218 v. @entity5 ( 08 - 1521 ) .			0
