@entity1 , @entity0 -- all goals count , so we 're told			1
but some are more equal than others and this is a rundown of the best 11 of all time			1
@entity10 's second strike against @entity0 at @entity11 tops our greatest - ever goal list			1
some of them are great individual goals , some of them are great team goals , but all of them are outstanding examples of the ball being put into the net			1
the capitals denote the team the goalscorer was playing for			1
let us know if you agree with our list by posting your comments in the @entity30 box below			1
1 @entity10 , @entity31 v @entity0 , @entity33 quarter - final 1986 if you 're @entity34 , the other goal he scored that day sticks in the craw as well as the mind			1
but for everyone else , @entity10 's match - winning genius was never better exemplified by this slaloming run , which started with a drag - back turn and went on to include feints , dropped shoulders and the calmest of finishes			1
it was later dubbed the goal of the century			1
who says players need two feet ? 2 @entity50 , @entity53 v @entity51 , @entity33 final 1970 the best team goal of all time			1
a sublime move began in the left - back spot with @entity53 's striker @entity59 and it would pass through eight of the team 's outfield players before ending up in the @entity64 net			1
@entity66 dribbled mazily in his own half , he gave it to @entity69 , who passed it on to @entity71 up the left			2
the winger fed @entity74 on the edge of the area , who held the ball up before laying it into the space to his right			2
there , the right - back @entity50 was approaching like an express train and he thundered the ball into the far corner			2
have we missed one of your favorite strikes out ? leave your suggestions below 3 @entity92 , @entity94 v @entity93 , @entity95 final 2002 a miracle of technique , this goal had @entity92 written all over it			2
a rampaging @entity101 sent over a looping cross from the left which dropped seemingly without danger out of the gray @entity106 sky			2
but from 18 yards out , @entity92 , intently watching the ball 's flight , caught it perfectly with his left foot , his shot bending unerringly into the top corner			2
4 @entity114 , @entity113 v @entity115 , @entity116 final 1988 much in the same way @entity92 's strike against @entity93 was a triumph of technique , @entity114 's dipping volley against the @entity118 took the breath away			2
@entity124 pumped over a ball from wide on the left and everyone was expecting @entity114 , in space on the far right of the box , to either pull the ball down or head it back into the area			1
instead he caught it sweetly , sending the ball arching over @entity115 keeper @entity135 's head and into the net from an impossible angle			2
5 @entity138 , @entity0 v @entity31 , @entity33 second round 1998 this was the goal that made @entity138 a household name			2
@entity143 found the 18 - year - old in space 35 yards from goal and the fearless striker brought the ball under control as he raced towards goal			0
shrugging off @entity152 's manhandling , he darted to the right of @entity154 and with @entity155 approaching to his right to steal his thunder , @entity138 arrowed his shot over @entity159 into the top corner			0
6 @entity162 , netherlands v @entity31 , @entity33 quarter - final 1998 deep in his own half , center - back @entity164 had few obvious attacking options on			0
sixty yards ahead of him , @entity162 was on the move and @entity170 picked out his run with a pin - point pass			0
as the ball dropped over his shoulder , an airborne @entity162 killed it and moved it inside the challenge of @entity154 in one fluid movement before flicking it with the outside of his right boot high past @entity159			0
in the last minute the game was won and jaws everywhere dropped			0
7 @entity184 , argentina v @entity185 & @entity186 , @entity33 group game 2006 @entity184 's name is in the record books as the goal scorer but the whole @entity31 line - up deserves a mention too			0
a rival to @entity50 's goal against @entity51 , the ball was shifted effortlessly between dark blue shirts 24 times , in and out of @entity185 players , before @entity184 played a one - two with @entity199 in the box and thumped home			1
the whole move looked effortless , but goals like that come along once in a blue moon			1
8 @entity206 , @entity209 v @entity207 , @entity210 semi-final 2007 perhaps the most amazing thing about this most amazing goal is its similarity to @entity10 's second goal against @entity0			0
picking the ball up from deep on the right , @entity206 ran at the @entity207 defense , skipping past challenges until faced with the keeper			0
forced wide , he kept his head and clipped home from a tight angle			0
@entity10 would have been proud			0
9 @entity224 , @entity227 v @entity225 , @entity228 2004 there are only a few players in world football capable of scoring a goal of such impudence			0
@entity224 always believed himself too good for the @entity235 league and this goal proved it in a show of immense skill , strength and ball control			0
the swaggering @entity241 danced in and out of countless despairing challenges , teasing the @entity225 defenders and then the keeper , before finally putting them out of their misery			0
10 @entity247 , @entity250 v @entity248 , @entity251 1996 goals that see players run the length of the pitch with the ball are always crowd favorites			1
@entity258 did something similar to @entity247 for @entity260 at the 1994 @entity33 but the effort by @entity247 , then the world footballer of the year , sticks longer in the memory			0
collecting an over-hit corner in his own box , @entity247 set off for the heart of the @entity248 defense			1
it looked liked he 'd lost the ball in the center circle but twisted his way out , flicked the ball round the final defender and ran on to slot home			0
11 @entity162 , @entity276 v @entity275 , @entity277 2002 it 's crazy to think there 's a debate about whether @entity162 meant this classiest of goals			1
@entity283 cut in from the left and threaded a pass to @entity162 's feet on the edge of the area			0
in the blink of an eye , the @entity235 master somehow back - heeled the ball around his marker , @entity294 , turned , held off the bemused defender and slotted coolly past @entity296 in goal .			0
