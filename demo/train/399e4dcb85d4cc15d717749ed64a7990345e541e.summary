a protest against racism and police violence packed sidewalks in @entity4 on tuesday , despite calls from the city 's mayor for a pause in demonstrations			1
as they marched past shops on the city 's storied @entity12 , some protesters chanted " hey - hey , ho - ho			2
these racist cops have got to go " and " how do you spell racist ? @entity17 " ; others carried signs saying " @entity20 killer cops " and " stop the war on @entity22			1
" mayor @entity23 had asked for the demonstrations to stop until after funerals for two police officers who were slain over the weekend in @entity27			1
but organizers of tuesday 's protest said there was no reason to " give in to hysteria " and call off the march			0
at first , marchers stayed on the sidewalks as a large police presence , with officers -- some wearing riot helmets and face shields -- keeping protesters from impeding holiday traffic			1
eventually , the demonstration spilled into the streets			0
the protest came hours after a moment of silence at @entity4 's @entity47 at 2:47 p.m. , three days to the minute since a gunman ambushed @entity17 officers @entity49 and @entity51			1
" there 's a lot of pain right now that we have to work our way through , " @entity23 said			0
" we have to keep working to bring police and community together			0
we have to put the divisions of the past behind us			0
" the mayor repeated his calls for the city to focus on the families of the fallen officers			2
" please embrace those around you as a symbol of our belief that we will move forward together , " he said after marking the moment when two officers were shot in an ambush			2
buildings and landmarks on the @entity4 skyline -- including the @entity76 and @entity78 buildings , @entity79 and 30 @entity80 -- were set to dim their lights for five minutes tuesday night in honor of slain officers			1
mourners flock to memorial @entity86 and his wife were among the mourners who stopped tuesday by a memorial at the site where the officers were killed , looking at flowers and an @entity94 flag hanging on the wall of a building			0
also drawn to the street memorial : the daughter of @entity99			1
" it was important to me , because in the case of my dad , people came out and they supported us			0
i just felt really saddened by it , because a young kid lost their father like i did , " @entity109 told @entity111 's " @entity110			0
" protesters have been pushing for a peaceful response , she said			2
and pushing for change , she said , does n't mean they 're anti-police			0
" not all cops are bad , " she said			0
" we 've just got to salute the good ones and weed out the bad ones			0
" the gunman who killed the officers ignored their message and " took it upon himself to take negative actions , " she said			1
" it 's ugly and it 's very tragic , " @entity99 said			1
" i do n't want anybody to die			0
there should n't be any more bloodshed			0
nobody needs to lose their life in a senseless way			0
" the backlash @entity86 has come under fire since the shooting , facing criticism that he 's fanned tensions between the public and police			2
authorities have n't established the gunman 's motive , but they 've noted that @entity143 , 28 , broadcast his plans to kill police on social media			1
and in some of his posts , investigators have said , he mentioned the controversial cases of @entity152 and @entity99 , @entity154 - @entity94 men who were killed by police			1
since saturday 's shooting , critics have taken aim at @entity23 's earlier comments supporting protesters who 've voiced their concerns about the case of @entity99 , a 43 - year - old who died in july after police in @entity165 placed him in what appeared to be a chokehold			1
a wave of protests erupted in @entity4 -- and nationwide -- after the officer involved was not indicted			1
the head of @entity4 's police union said @entity23 had " blood on his hands			1
" and , in the aftermath of saturday 's shootings , video showed officers turning their backs on the mayor as he walked through a hospital			1
organizers of tuesday 's protest in @entity4 accused some leaders of manipulating the situation			2
" this is a misguided response to the current situation and is meant to chill the expression of free speech rights , " the @entity188 said in a statement			0
" representatives of police unions are taking advantage of and seizing upon the actions of a lone , troubled individual who shot his ex-girlfriend and then killed two police officers in @entity27 to smear , discredit and end the broad social movement that has demanded accountability , an end to police misconduct and police violence			1
" police seeking help police are asking the public 's help to piece together how the gunman who killed the two officers spent two hours before the slayings			1
@entity143 , who ranted against the government and law enforcement on social media , ambushed and shot to death @entity49 and @entity51 as they sat in their patrol car at about 2:45 p.m. saturday in the @entity27 neighborhood of @entity221			0
police have said @entity143 started his day in @entity223 , where he shot and seriously wounded his ex-girlfriend at her apartment in the early morning and then took a @entity226 bus to @entity4			2
police commissioner @entity227 told reporters that investigators believe the gunman acted alone , but he said that police still need a full understanding of @entity143 's actions			2
" we owe it to the families to find out what happened , " @entity227 said			0
" that 's why we 're seeking to build this case up , so we know going forward exactly who talked to this man			0
