-- the debate over whether the hand - to - hand - combat excesses of @entity3 represent a grotesque over-commercialization of the holiday season has lost its meaning			1
the point is no longer whether or not @entity3 tarnishes the holidays			1
the point is that @entity3 has become a holiday of its own			1
it will arrive again this week , even as @entity12 are still sitting at their @entity14 dinner tables			1
@entity3 -- with its door - buster sales , hordes of frenzied shoppers shoving for position , employees nervously waiting for the onslaught -- has shrugged off the confines of its name and has now established squatters ' rights on thursday			2
@entity26 stores will open at 9 p.m. @entity14 night , three hours earlier than the stores ' midnight opening in 2011			1
@entity29 will begin its @entity3 sales at 8 p.m. on @entity14			1
@entity31 will match that 8 p.m. opening , as will @entity33			0
@entity34 , which will wait until midnight to open its doors , seems almost like a dowdy throwback			0
the store employees around the country who are upset that the schedules will deprive them of a big part of their holiday thursday ( many of them will have to arrive hours before the customers ) and the citizens who fret that the lure of the deeply discounted sales will empty out their home - for - the - holidays family gatherings are probably fighting a losing battle			1
@entity3 appears to be triumphant , and it has taken on the characteristics of the holidays it mimics			2
like real holidays , it occurs on a predesignated day each year			0
people anticipate it and mark the date			0
across the breadth of the nation they are absent from work to observe it			0
and when the day arrives , they congregate like			2
established religious holidays , such as @entity63 and @entity64 , have long been occasions for gift - giving ; some holidays -- @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 -- have eagerly been embraced by merchants as a way to move their products			0
@entity3 does away with the middleman -- in the universe of holidays , it is the only one that exists solely to sell merchandise			2
it celebrates nothing ; it commemorates only itself			0
it is an annual festival of the cash register			0
news : retail employess fight " @entity3 creep " the derivation of the term " @entity3 " is open to dispute , but it has come to refer to the theory that merchants go into the black -- into the profit side of the ledger -- during the holiday shopping season , which traditionally commences the day after @entity14			1
certainly , and especially in this economy , anything that brings people into the stores is welcome			1
brick - and - mortar stores can use the foot traffic as shopping goes increasingly online			0
and digital doors are open 24 hours a day , every day of the year			0
but there is something about @entity3 -- in the pandemonium of its execution -- that is unsettling and cynical			1
the @entity29 employee who was trampled to death on @entity108 in 2008 as shoppers knocked the doors from their hinges and stepped on him in their rush to the stacks of sales items , the woman in @entity116 last year who unleashed pepper spray on fellow shoppers vying for @entity121 video game consoles			0
those kinds of scenes are becoming the iconic images of the long night			0
of course , the new holiday would not have taken hold if people were n't embracing it			2
but you have to ask yourself : when people , as they grow older , remember the best holidays of their lives , is it some discounted gift that they recall with warmth and fondness ? some deal that they found ? or is it the family members and loved ones with whom they spent the holiday time ? breaking up the flow of a real holiday so you can make it on time to the beginning of the @entity3 holiday seems a little misguided			1
it is one thing during the holiday season to be touched by the poignancy of long lines at soup kitchens and food pantries ; it is quite another to witness throngs in the darkness bearing credit cards , waiting to stampede through stores in desperate and hungry - eyed pursuit of flat - screen tvs and @entity160 players			1
at least earnest groups of neighborhood vocalists are not -- yet -- going door - to - door singing @entity3 carols			2
but just give them time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			2

@entity168 : holiday season too commercialized ? no , @entity3 has become a holiday
he says it has the markings : it *'s* observed across nation , people take day off to congregate
he says , yes , it brings people into stores in a down economy , but cost of this unsettling
@entity168 : is getting a deal on a tv worth rushing from home , *hearth* , family at @entity14 ?
