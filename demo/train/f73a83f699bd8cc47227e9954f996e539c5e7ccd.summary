-- every war veteran has stories			1
they can be shocking , harrowing , tragic -- sometimes even funny			1
the problem for families trying to understand those experiences , on @entity4 and every day , is that they wo n't hear much about them			1
many vets have trouble talking about them			2
this was the case with my father , who saw lots of action as an artilleryman in the @entity18 during @entity19 when i was a kid , i 'd beg him for tales about the war			1
usually , he waved me away			2
sometimes , though , he gave in to my badgering			2
i found it strange that most of his accounts were short on the blood and guts bravado that my @entity29 comic books had led me to expect			2
mostly , they were about men who simply wanted to do their job and go home , but found themselves subject to the deadly coin toss of war			1
like today 's soldiers recovering from injuries , suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or haunted by images of fallen friends , he soon learned after returning home that he could n't explain war to a civilian			1
he would carry this alone			2
" there 's no way anyone who was n't there could understand , " he would say			1
he shook his head telling about the time he had been relieved of duty at a forward observation post			0
moments after he walked away , an enemy shell hit the site			0
it obliterated everyone there , including the friend who had just taken his place			0
he was lucky in war			1
i think that bothered him , too			0
his unit saw 187 days of active battle , but his only injury came when his leg was peppered with shrapnel during an assault			1
doctors told him the leg had to come off or he could die			1
he refused to let the doctors operate , and they reluctantly respected his wishes			0
then a new " wonder drug " arrived			0
it was the first batch of penicillin to reach the @entity18 , and his life was saved			0
why was he spared and others not ? again , he could n't explain			1
one day , he heard that an acquaintance -- a kid from his hometown in @entity81 -- had been killed in a nearby conflict			1
he drove to the battlefield to search for the body , but most of the dead were too disfigured to be recognized			0
finally , he gave up			0
he could n't understand why he had wanted to find him			1
or , what he would have done if he had			0
" really , i did n't even know him , " he told me			2
at some point during those evenings , he would stop and turn his head			0
i knew he was finished then , and i would wander off , leaving him to his distant world			0
years later , as a reporter , i wrote a series of articles about @entity19 veterans			1
each had his own accounts of exploits and escapes			0
like @entity103 , they usually had to be coaxed into talking			1
often , the interviews astounded members of their own family who were hearing the stories for the first time			2
like many veterans today , the war never left my father			1
for years , he suffered bouts of malaria from his time in the @entity115			0
his wounded leg sometimes gave him trouble			2
he regretted not signing up for disability pay while getting his discharge			0
but the line of injured vets was too long for him to wait			0
he wanted to get home to a bride he had n't seen in 3Â½ years			2
and a 4 - year - old son he 'd never met			2
my father respected the sentiment behind @entity4 , but it was n't an observance he enjoyed			1
@entity103 became a successful businessman in a small @entity133 town after the war and , each year , the @entity4 parade filed past his storefront			1
he never joined it , or added his voice to the cheering crowd			0
while everyone else saw the ranks of veterans parading past , he saw the wartime buddies who were n't there			1
so , he simply watched grim - faced until it was over			0
then he went back inside and tried to forget all over again			0
join us @entity147 / @entity146			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			1

@entity150 : war veterans have tales , sometimes harrowing ; many ca n't tell them
others ca n't understand , he says ; it was like this with his father , who served in @entity19
he says sometimes , though , he 'd share stories of friends killed , of nearly losing leg
@entity150 : @entity103 did n't enjoy @entity4 . when parade passed , he only saw friends lost
