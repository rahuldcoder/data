-- you 've probably heard by now about the @entity2 and the @entity3 -- but what about the @entity5 ? it 's the term created by @entity8 entrepreneur @entity7 , one of @entity10 's most successful businessmen , to describe what he believes holds the key to the continent 's future well - being			1
according to @entity7 , @entity15 is the economic philosophy " that the @entity18 private sector has the power to transform the continent through long - term investments , creating both economic prosperity and social wealth			1
" @entity7 champions the idea that long - term focus on key sectors such as infrastructure and power does not only offer high returns but , in the process , can also help @entity10 deal with pressing problems such as unemployment and food security			1
" the information people have about @entity10 in @entity40 and the western world is one of aid , one of squalor , one of poverty , one of religious crisis , " says @entity7 , who first found success after turning a struggling @entity8 bank into a global financial institution			1
" they need to begin to see that @entity10 is a continent of economic opportunities -- a lot of potential and the returns on investment in @entity10 is huge			2
" read this : @entity10 's mega projects backing his words with actions , @entity7 , the former chief executive of the @entity56 , who went on to create investment company @entity7 in 2010 , has pledged $ 2.5 billion to @entity40 president @entity61 's " @entity65 " initiative -- a campaign aiming to double access to electricity in @entity10			1
@entity0 's @entity66 spoke to @entity7 about @entity67 , doing business in @entity10 and his goals for the future			1
an excerpt of the interview follows			0
@entity0 : what is @entity67 and how does it work ? @entity7 : from interacting with customers , with communities , with local governments , state governments and national governments , i started to see a pattern that indeed we can as a private sector help to develop @entity10 in a manner that 's truly sustainable			1
i also , as a good student of economic history , have observed the development of the @entity18 continent and come to realize that despite all the aid inflows into @entity10 and despite our sovereign government commitment to develop in the continent , not much was achieved			0
but ... if we can mobilize the @entity18 private sector and @entity93 private sector operating in @entity10 to think long - term , to invest long - term in @entity10 in key sectors , then we might end up creating economic wealth , economic prosperity and social wealth			1
@entity0 : which areas does the private sector in @entity10 focus on ? @entity7 : the private sector in @entity10 was largely dependent on government patronage , government contracts			2
but today , it has changed significantly			0
you have the private sector in @entity10 today that is adding real value to the economy through engagements in payment systems ; through engagement in key infrastructure projects ; through engagement in manufacturing and processing of raw materials in @entity10 and exporting this within the continent			0
read this : @entity120 plans $ 10 billion tech city so it 's a significant shift from where the private sector was before to where it is today and we 're beginning to see a new crop of private sector people in @entity10 who believe under the sun that they have a role to play in the development of the continent			2
@entity0 : why did @entity134 decided to commit $ 2.5 billion to the " @entity65 " initiative ? @entity7 : because we understand as africapitalists the importance of power , access to electricity , in unleashing the economic potential of @entity10			1
because of that , we felt since we preach that the private sector should do long - term investment in @entity10 in key sectors , there is no sector at this point in time to us that is as strategic as power sector in dealing with the issue of economic empowerment , democratization of economic prosperity across the continent than power			1
@entity0 : looking ahead , what do you think is going to be the most important source of power ? @entity7 : @entity10 is coming from a deficit position -- only 20 % of 1.2 billion people have access to electricity			2
so we need to think of the kind of projects that will help us create the quantum leap we need in power			0
and i think that that is what should guide the options that we take			0
read this : can @entity10 unlock solar potential ? so for me , i believe that we need five years of sustained , massive billion dollar investments ( in the ) power sector in @entity10 before we come to the level where we need to discriminate , is it this kind of power or that type of power ? but let there be light first in @entity10			2
@entity0 : what are your goals for the future ? @entity7 : my goals for the future are twofold -- one is personal and two is about the continent			2
for my personal goal i would like to continue to impact my team			0
because you get to a certain level where you wake up in the morning not necessarily because you want to earn a living -- you wake up in the morning i think about impact , about legacies , what impact am i going to leave behind ? and so i decide to look at the @entity18 continent and i tell myself this is a continent that is about to explode but lacks certain vital ingredients			0
and so what role can i play in making sure that some of those challenges are addressed in my lifetime , so that my children will not as a kind of question i asked of my parents and grandparents , where were they when the war started ? so that 's important to me			0
and that is why we invest in power			0
not just because i want to make more money , which is good , but because we touch lives significantly making that money .			0
