the rev. @entity2 says celibacy sets the priest apart as a symbol of the world to come			1
( @entity22 ) -- the scandal surrounding the rev. @entity24 has raised questions in the minds of many concerning the @entity28 's discipline of priestly celibacy			1
why does the church continue to defend a practice that seems so unnatural and so unnecessary ? there is a very bad argument for celibacy , which has appeared throughout the tradition and which is , even today , defended by some			1
it goes something like this : married life is spiritually suspect ; priests , as religious leaders , should be spiritual athletes above reproach ; therefore , priests should n't be married this approach to the question is , in my judgment , not just stupid but dangerous , for it rests on presumptions that are repugnant to solid @entity51 doctrine			1
the biblical teaching on creation implies the essential integrity of the world and everything in it			1
@entity57 tells us that @entity59 found each thing he had made good and that he found the ensemble of creatures very good			2
catholic theology , at its best , has always been resolutely , anti-dualist -- and this means that matter , the body , marriage and sexual activity are never , in themselves , to be despised			1
but there is more to the doctrine of creation than an affirmation of the goodness of the world			1
to say that the finite realm in its entirety is created is to imply that nothing in the universe is @entity59			2
all aspects of created reality reflect @entity59 and bear traces of the divine goodness -- just as every detail of a building gives evidence of the mind of the architect -- but no creature and no collectivity of creatures is divine , just as no part of a structure is the architect			0
this distinction between @entity59 and the world is the ground for the anti-idolatry principle that is reiterated from the beginning to the end of the @entity101 : do not turn something less than @entity59 into @entity59			2
@entity105 the prophet put it thus : " as high as the heavens are above the earth , so high are my thoughts above your thoughts and my ways above your ways , says the @entity103			0
" and it is at the heart of the @entity115 : " i am the lord your @entity59 ; you shall have no other gods besides me			0
" the @entity101 thus holds off all the attempts of human beings to divinize or render ultimate some worldly reality			0
the doctrine of creation , in a word , involves both a great " yes " and a great " no " to the universe			0
now there is a behavioral concomitant to the anti-idolatry principle , and it is called detachment			0
detachment is the refusal to make anything less than @entity59 the organizing principle or center of one 's life			0
@entity136 looked at it from the other side and said " an attachment is anything in this world -- including your own life -- that you are convinced you can not live without			2
" even as we reverence everything that @entity59 has made , we must let go of everything that @entity59 has made , precisely for the sake of @entity59			0
this is why , as @entity149 noted , there is a tension to @entity51 life			0
in accord with its affirmation of the world , the @entity28 loves color , pageantry , music and rich decoration ( as in the liturgy and papal ceremonials ) , even as , in accord with its detachment from the world , it loves the poverty of @entity166 and the simplicity of @entity168			1
the same tension governs its attitude toward sex and family			0
again , in @entity149 's language , the @entity28 is " fiercely for having children " ( through marriage ) even as it remains " fiercely against having them " ( in religious celibacy )			1
everything in this world -- including sex and intimate friendship -- is good , but impermanently so ; all finite reality is beautiful , but its beauty , if i can put it in explicitly @entity28 terms , is sacramental , not ultimate			1
in the biblical narratives , when @entity59 wanted to make a certain truth vividly known to his people , he would , from time to time , choose a prophet and command him to act out that truth , to embody it concretely			0
for example , he told @entity193 to marry the unfaithful @entity194 in order to sacramentalize @entity59 's fidelity to wavering @entity197			0
thus , the truth of the non-ultimacy of sex , family and worldly relationship can and should be proclaimed through words , but it will be believed only when people can see it			0
this is why , the @entity28 is convinced , @entity59 chooses certain people to be celibate			1
their mission is to witness to a transcendent form of love , the way that we will love in heaven			0
in @entity59 's realm , we will experience a communion ( bodily as well as spiritual ) compared to which even the most intense forms of communion here below pale into insignificance , and celibates make this truth viscerally real for us now			0
though one can present practical reasons for it , i believe that celibacy only finally makes sense in this eschatological context			2
for years , the rev. @entity228 argued -- quite rightly in my view -- that the priest is fascinating and that a large part of the fascination comes from celibacy			1
the compelling quality of the priest is not a matter of superficial celebrity or charm			2
it is something much stranger , deeper , more mystical			0
it is the fascination for another world			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the rev. @entity2 .			1

the rev. @entity2 : why does @entity28 back practice that seems unnecessary ?
he says he *rejects* the " marriage is spiritually suspect " defense of celibacy
but celibacy sets the priest apart as a symbol of another world , he says
