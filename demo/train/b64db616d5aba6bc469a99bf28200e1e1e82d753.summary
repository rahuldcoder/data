-- with two important cases on gay rights and marriage equality slated for oral arguments in the @entity7 next week , @entity1 of all stripes are participating in a national debate over this emotionally charged issue -- on the @entity10 , on television , in our leading newspapers and around countless dinner tables			1
despite this interest , only a handful of people will get to see these historic arguments -- those who show up to the courtroom next tuesday and wednesday			0
this is the result of the @entity7 's longstanding policy prohibiting cameras inside the courtroom			1
the court 's main reason for banning cameras -- as justices @entity28 and @entity30 reminded us recently at a congressional hearing -- is there would be an increased risk the justices ' questions and comments would be taken out of context and then played ( and replayed ) on the news or , worse yet , lampooned on " @entity40			2
" this would be a completely valid concern if it were n't for the fact that it 's happening already			0
as the justices well know , reporters , columnists , cartoonists and late - night comedians already extract the juiciest sound bites from oral arguments , sometimes taking them out of context and blowing them up into big stories			1
indeed , such sound bites often dominate the media 's coverage of the @entity7			1
for evidence of this , look no further than justice @entity61 's remark from the court 's oral argument in the case of @entity65			0
@entity61 suggested the @entity66 had survived only because of the self - perpetuating power of " racial entitlements " -- a comment that generated countless news stories , editorials , op - eds and political cartoons , to say nothing of parodies on satirical shows such as " @entity77 " and " @entity78			0
" or , better yet , consider justice @entity80 ' decision in january to tell a joke during oral argument -- breaking his seven - year streak of silence and , in the process , becoming front - page news			0
does anyone , other than the closest court - watcher , even remember the name of that case or the issues it presented ? or , take the constant plight of @entity30 , who commentators tend to assume is the decisive vote in each of the court 's most important cases			1
his every question , word , sigh and hiccup becomes a key part of how cases are covered in the media , as everyone scrambles for possible clues for how @entity30 might vote			0
needless to say -- and as @entity30 well knows -- such predictions are often inaccurate			0
sometimes , the focus on sound bites is entirely appropriate			1
@entity61 's characterization of the @entity66 was offensive , and it deserved to be national news			0
furthermore , it 's important to report potentially revealing comments from the court 's swing justice			2
but more often than not , the media coverage of the court is already focused on sound bites , which sometimes get taken out of context			1
therefore , the @entity7 might as well open up and let all @entity1 experience the majesty of its hearings -- an experience that can be captured only by attending an argument in person or by watching an argument unfold live in one 's living room or on one 's laptop			1
as lawyers who have been to dozens of @entity7 hearings , we can confidently say that there 's nothing that the federal government does that 's more impressive than the high - quality debates that occur on a daily basis before the @entity7			2
the @entity1 public would be astonished at the skill of the advocates , the force of the questions and the overall level at which legal issues are debated before our high court			2
if only they could see these arguments in real time , in their entirety			0
since media coverage of the high court already focuses on the trite at the expense of the court 's majesty , it makes sense to remove the media filter			0
exposing the @entity1 public to the fullness of @entity7 arguments by permitting cameras in the courtroom would be a service rather than hindrance to the judiciary			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 and @entity169 .			2

the @entity7 will hear two important cases on gay rights next week
@entity168 , @entity169 : justices should allow cameras inside the courtroom
they say court coverage tends to be focused on sound bites from justices already
@entity168 , @entity169 : court has nothing to lose by permitting all @entity1 to see it in action
