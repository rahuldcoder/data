@entity0 -- @entity3 presidential hopeful @entity2 threw his campaign another curve ball when he revived the sensitive " birther " issue while campaigning in his native @entity7 on friday			1
speaking before a friendly crowd in the @entity10 suburb of @entity11 , @entity2 noted that he and his wife , @entity12 , were born at nearby hospitals			2
" no one 's ever asked to see my birth certificate			1
they know that this is the place that we were born and raised			0
the crowd roared at the quip , which was seemingly directed at president @entity22 , who has faced questions for years from some conservative @entity3 quarters about his birthplace			1
only @entity27 - born citizens can be president and @entity22 released his full birth certificate last year from @entity30 to quiet critics			1
@entity2 has said he believes @entity22 was born in the @entity27 and that the issue was put to rest last year			1
although the zinger once again cast @entity3 candidate away from their key message : that @entity22 has mismanaged the economy and @entity2 is the better of the two to get things back on track			1
political analysts agree that @entity2 does much better when he sticks to economic issues and his experience in business , two themes @entity3 will stress at next week 's nominating convention in @entity46			2
but this week , @entity2 and @entity3 nationally have been consumed by a political firestorm caused by @entity50 candidate @entity49 's explosive comments on rape and pregnancy			2
@entity2 spent a good amount of time since they were aired on sunday in a @entity57 television interview denouncing @entity49 's remarks and fielding questions about abortion			2
and now , his campaign is responding to ' birther ' questions			0
a @entity2 aide that he was only pointing out that @entity7 is the state where he was " born and raised			1
" @entity66 , a senior fellow at the @entity67 , author of @entity69 on the @entity70 : how @entity71 brought down the @entity72 , believed it was just @entity2 being awkward in trying to make a point about his roots			2
" i 'm somewhat surprised that he would make that joke because he 's done a good job confirming that president @entity22 was the legitimate president of the @entity27 , " said @entity76 an associate professor of political science at @entity78 and author of " @entity80			2
" @entity2 has had a hard time appealing to the right wing of the @entity3 base , and the comment could , to some , have been a way getting a bump in support -- including financial support -- heading into the convention , said @entity94 , an african - american studies professor at @entity95 and the author of several books , including " new black man : rethinking @entity99			1
" " the best way to do that is to play to the crassest elements of the base , " @entity94 said			0
others felt the comments subtly signaled race			0
" the ' birther ' issues is only an issue that involves the country 's first black president , " said @entity106 , a political science professor and director of @entity108 's @entity109			0
" and so it raises questions still about the legitimacy about this administration			0
" and for others , it is a problem of message control when the campaign faces periods of stress			0
on his overseas trip last month , @entity2 offended @entity125 when he questioned the city 's readiness to host the @entity128 and @entity129 when he credited @entity131 culture for its economic success			0
" it does speak to a lack of discipline overall , " @entity66 said of @entity2 's birth certificate comment			1
" look , candidates are going to say dumb things , the president said there were 57 states in the country			0
@entity143 knows what @entity144 will say on any given day			0
if you give 100 speeches , you 're going to mess something up			0
but the @entity2 campaign does n't seem to respond well to this			1

' no one has ever asked to see my birth certificate , ' @entity2 said in his native @entity7
quip another *distraction* for @entity2 campaign preparing for @entity158 convention
was @entity2 trying to appeal to conservative base or was it just an awkward comment ?
@entity2 campaign said that candidate believes @entity22 was born in the @entity27
