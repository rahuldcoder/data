@entity1 , @entity0 -- the first child in @entity6 known to have been screened as an embryo to ensure she did not carry a cancer gene was born friday , a spokesman for @entity4 told @entity2			1
genetic screening allows lab - fertilized embryos to be tested for genes likely to lead to later health problems			1
her embryo was screened in a lab days after conception to check for the @entity18 - 1 gene , linked to breast and ovarian cancer			1
people with the gene are known to have a 50 - 80 percent chance of developing breast or ovarian cancer in their lifetimes			1
@entity6 newspapers have dubbed the girl the " cancer - free " baby			1
" this little girl will not face the specter of developing this genetic form of breast cancer or ovarian cancer in her adult life , " said @entity31 , a consultant at @entity32 and medical director of the @entity34			1
" the parents will have been spared the risk of inflicting this disease on their daughter			0
the lasting legacy is the eradication of the transmission of this form of cancer that has blighted these families for generations			2
" yet not everyone is thrilled with the idea of testing embryos for genes that could cause health problems later in life , a process known as preimplanatation genetic diagnosis			1
" this is not a cure for breast cancer , " said @entity60 , co-founder of @entity61 on @entity62 , which describes itself as group that focuses on ethical dilemmas related to reproduction			1
what do you think about testing embryos for gene defects ? " this is simply a mechanism for eliminating the birth of anybody ( prone to ) the disease , " she said			1
" it is basically a search - and - kill mechanism			2
" she opposes the procedure because embryos found to carry disease - causing genes often are discarded			1
she says that is essentially murder			0
" they will be destroyed , " she said			0
" they will never be allowed to live			0
" doctors in @entity6 and elsewhere increasingly test embryos for genes that are certain to cause illnesses such as cystic fibrosis or @entity92			1
what 's different about the girl born friday is that she is the first infant known to have been tested in @entity6 as an embryo for a gene that is merely likely -- not certain -- to cause disease			1
in the @entity99 , geneticists are free to test for any condition for which they can develop a probe -- and they 're free to look for genes that are certain to cause diseases as well as genes that merely may pose problems later in life			1
@entity60 opposes any form of in - vitro fertilization where embryos are " killed , " she said			2
but she is particularly troubled by the idea of screening an embryo for the @entity18 - 1 gene because carriers of the gene do not always develop the disease , and the disease is not always fatal			1
" the message we are sending is : ' better off dead than carrying ( a gene linked to ) breast cancer , ' " she said			1
" we have gone very much down the proverbial slippery slope			0
" @entity124 , one of the top @entity6 experts on the genetic testing of embryos , said he understands the ethical objections but focuses on the benefits			1
" there has always been a vociferous group in opposition , " he said			0
but " there are people who can benefit and i think they should be allowed to do so			0
" in fact , he argues that the procedure actually prevents abortions because it takes place on a three - day old embryo in a lab. only embryos that lack the defective gene are implanted			1
" i do n't think you can equate eight cells in a dish to an embryo or a child , " said @entity124 , head of the department of women 's health at the @entity145			1
for many couples , the alternative to testing an embryo is to conceive a child naturally and test the fetus weeks or months into a pregnancy			2
some couples opt for an abortion when such testing reveals a defect			0
diagnosing an embryo genetically typically involves fertilizing an egg with a sperm in a lab , testing the resulting embryo and implanting it in the mother if no defects are found			2
@entity124 agrees that testing for diseases that may not be fatal -- or may not manifest themselves for decades -- raises thorny ethical questions			0
" how serious does it have to be before you throw away an embryo ? " he asked			2
" are you prepared to throw away a 16 - week embryo for @entity92 's , which will not manifest until age 40 ? " in @entity6 , the @entity178 determines the conditions for which geneticists can test			1
it has approved testing for more than 60 conditions since it was established in 1990			0
the authority approved testing for the @entity18 - 1 gene in 2008			2
dr. @entity187 , who founded a genetics clinic in the @entity99 , said he likes the idea of an authority that regulates what tests can be performed -- the system in place in @entity6 -- but believes that parents who want to test for genetic abnormalities should be allowed to do so			2
at his @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity187 carries out about two tests a month for @entity18 - 1 or brca - 2 , a related gene			2
" the couple is the best one to be making these decisions , because they live with these diseases , " he said			0
" when it hits your family over and over again , many couples are saying : ' enough of this			0
let 's prune this out of our family tree forever			0
' " he rejects the notion that parents will use genetic testing to remove all imperfections from children			0
" you can get up on your high horse and say people are looking for perfect children , but let 's give these families more credit , " he said			0
" they just want one that has a fighting chance of not having a disease			0
" @entity187 said he doubts genetic screening will ever be used to test all babies			2
that 's partly because it costs the equivalent of about $ 11,755 -- 8,000 @entity6 pounds -- to screen embryos			1
it 's also because the process is very complex			0
" it 's gotten easier to do now than it was 19 years ago , " when @entity187 did his first test for cystic fibrosis , he said			0
" but it has not exploded , not burst onto the medical field like some technologies do			0
" no one would use these technologies for a trivial reason			0
it 's too much effort , " he said			0
" not just the money -- it 's so many hoops to jump through for a couple that would prefer to make their baby on vacation rather than in a clinic			2

" cancer - free baby " born ; baby girl is first in @entity6 to be screened for cancer gene
embryo was screened to check she did n't carry gene linked to breast , ovarian cancer
ethicists *criticize* screening for genes that could cause later health problems
doctors say cost of screening makes it unlikely all embryos will ever be tested
