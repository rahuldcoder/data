-- it was one of the most memorable scenes in recent @entity4 history -- @entity5 running along the touchline to celebrate with his @entity8 side at @entity9 after a late goal knocked out @entity11 in 2004			1
ten years later @entity5 made another long dash on the touchline in the @entity4 , this time after his @entity14 scored an 87th - minute goal through @entity16 to take control against @entity18 in the quarterfinals			1
he was n't overly celebrating but instead giving instructions to his team on how to protect the lead in the dying stages			0
@entity14 did hang on , winning 2 - 0 at home to overturn a 3 - 1 first - leg deficit and advance on away goals in a battle of the rich versus the rich in @entity31 football			1
@entity5 thus will be managing a team in the @entity4 last four for the fifth consecutive campaign			2
" @entity35 made a crucial finish for us and i think ( it was ) very much deserved , " @entity5 told @entity34			0
" the team that decided to defend was punished and the team that played with their heart deserved to go to the semis			0
" a @entity4 winner with @entity8 and @entity42 , @entity5 is seeking to achieve the feat with his beloved @entity44			2
@entity14 will be joined in the semis by @entity5 's previous club @entity45 , which survived -- barely -- without @entity46 against 2013 finalist @entity47			1
@entity47 won 2 - 0 at home tuesday but was eliminated 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
" it was a night of suffering but at the end of it we are happy as we are through to the semifinals , " @entity45 manager @entity51 told @entity52			2
the opening 25 minutes in @entity57 suggested the visitors would comfortably cope with @entity14			1
but after @entity60 had to scramble to get a hand to @entity63 's deflected free kick , the game changed			0
@entity66 , only on the field after an injury to @entity14 's offensive star , @entity65 , converted from @entity69 's flick in the 32nd minute			2
@entity70 awoke , and @entity66 and @entity71 struck the crossbar seconds apart shortly after the break			0
@entity74 skied over the bar in the 77th minute and substitute @entity16 made @entity18 pay for the miss when he netted into the roof of the net			1
@entity5 has openly criticized his strikers this season , with @entity16 not seeing much playing time , but the @entity82 international finished impressively with his left foot while falling to the ground			2
" i saw the ball and it was in the goal , " he told @entity34			0
" i just do what i have to do when i get chances			0
i did n't have chances this season but tonight i took it			0
" beaten in injury time last week to give @entity18 the two - goal advantage , @entity14 keeper @entity93 preserved his team 's passage tuesday by pushing away @entity99 ' effort in added time			1
how @entity18 must have rued the absence of injured striker @entity102			2
@entity47 , meanwhile , has history in engineering miracles in the @entity4 quarterfinals against @entity107 opposition , scoring twice in injury time last year to overcome @entity109 3 - 2 on aggregate			1
but things took a turn for the worse for @entity114 's men when fullback @entity115 gave away a penalty for handball			0
without @entity46 , duties were left to @entity119			0
@entity120 slipped , though still managed a good shot , but @entity122 dived to his left to thwart the @entity125 winger			0
the save ignited @entity47 , which had inspirational striker @entity127 back in its ranks following a first - leg suspension			1
@entity47 -- which ousted @entity45 in last season 's competition -- also got help from the @entity45 back four			1
@entity134 's poor touch meant for keeper @entity135 was intercepted by an alert @entity137 and the @entity139 international held his nerve to make it 1 - 0 in the 24th minute			1
another @entity45 gaffe led to another @entity47 break : @entity135 tipped @entity127 's shot onto the post but @entity137 was there for the rebound in the 37th minute			1
@entity45 coped slightly better in the second half , although @entity47 midfielder @entity149 hit the post after rounding @entity135			2
@entity135 -- not the starter in @entity151 -- then had to be alert to stop @entity149 and @entity152 , with @entity137 booked for a dive in the box			0
" we were clearly the better side today and we really should have scored more goals , but because the game and our performance was so extraordinarily good i really will not make accusations to anyone today , " @entity114 told @entity52			0
on wednesday , @entity11 visits defending champion @entity162 and @entity164 hosts @entity165			0
both ties are leveled at 1 - 1 .			1

@entity14 overcomes 3 - 1 first - leg deficit against @entity18 to reach @entity4 semis
@entity16 scores a late goal in @entity57 as @entity14 advances on away goals
@entity45 *withstands* a @entity47 *fightback* to also go through
@entity47 wins 2 - 0 at home but loses 3 - 2 on aggregate
