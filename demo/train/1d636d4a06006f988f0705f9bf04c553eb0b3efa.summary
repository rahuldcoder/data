-- @entity1 has bought a 3 - d - sensor company that helped build @entity4 's motion - control system @entity3 , stirring curiosity about what the tech giant might be up to behind closed doors in @entity9			1
@entity10 is an @entity11 - based company that specializes in sensors that let users interact with mobile devices like tablets and smartphones by waving their hands			1
the company 's technology was used to help create @entity3 , rolled out for the @entity20 in 2010 as a way for gamers to put down the controller and use their bodies and voices to play games			2
it 's been incorporated further into the new @entity29 console , letting users control movies and other media with their voices			0
@entity1 had reportedly been in talks with @entity10 since july			1
the deal was sealed for a reported $ 360 million			1
a statement released by @entity1 in response to queries resulted in the same " non-confirmation confirmation " it has released after past acquisitions			2
" @entity1 buys smaller technology companies from time to time , and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans , " the statement says			1
@entity10 has confirmed the purchase but offered no further details			2
the purchase , of course , immediately spurred speculation about what @entity1 might have in mind			2
" @entity1 could be thinking a number of things , from gaming on @entity57 to a way to interact with @entity59 or the rumored tv set , " said @entity53 , a tech analyst with @entity54			1
she said she doubts @entity1 is working on a dedicated gaming device			1
instead , she speculated , the company could be looking at a way to connect multiple devices and operate them at the same time			0
" gesture certainly has a place in complementing touch and voice as a way to interact with different devices , " she said			0
" gesture could be particularly useful in interacting with different screens in the home			0
" the less exciting possibility is that we 'll never see a product or feature as a direct result of the buyout			0
" @entity1 has done a series of acquisitions that we have not seen through as far as a practical implementation of the technology , " @entity53 said			2
but as the news spread monday , it was the possibility of the long - rumored @entity59 set that many were thinking about			0
@entity1 - centric blog 9to5 @entity87 reported in september that @entity1 was testing motion - sensor technology for television products			1
to some , the @entity10 purchase signals that @entity1 is working on something truly different			1
the television has supposedly been in the works for years , and the company is widely expected to be rolling out a smartwatch in the not - too - distant future			0
but incremental upgrades to its popular @entity100 and @entity57 lines in recent years have led some observers to say the company has lost its knack for groundbreaking innovation			0
that 's a concept @entity53 rejects			0
" to think that @entity1 is not innovating just because we do not see a new category of product hitting the market is quite shortsighted , " she said .			0

@entity1 buys @entity111 motion - sensor company @entity10
@entity113 reportedly was for $ 360 million
analyst says technology could be for an @entity1 tv set or for gaming
