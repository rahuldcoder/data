@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 's first minister , is fond of saying that when the @entity5 was first formed in 1945 , it had just 50 members			1
today , he adds , that figure has risen to almost 200			0
it 's a nice line , although in reality the emergence of a new nation remains relatively rare			2
but there does seem to be a pattern emerging , in @entity14 and beyond			0
in @entity16 ( @entity17 ) and @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , as well as the @entity20 ( @entity3 ) , secessionist movements appear to be on the rise			1
all three have existed for decades , yet they seem particularly lively in the second decade of the 21st century			0
thus @entity2 , who this weekend addresses delegates at the @entity25 's annual conference in the @entity3 city of @entity27 , likes to talk of @entity3 's " home rule journey " being part of a bigger international trend			1
his point is clear : " independence , " far from being dangerous or unusual , is a natural state of affairs			2
professor @entity34 , an expert in secession , says all three countries have a history of regional -- or devolved -- government ( relatively recently in the case of the @entity20 )			1
" i was considering the old question , " he says , " about whether regional government structures aid or inhibit secessionist movements			1
" it seems to me that they aid them , other things being equal			0
the secessionist party will come to power , sooner or later , because governments become unpopular			0
if they then govern well , this serves as a further mobilizing mechanism			0
" only recently a secessionist movement , the nationalist party @entity54 first took office in @entity17 in 1980 , while in @entity3 the @entity25 formed a minority government in 2007 -- becoming a majority four years later			1
in @entity19 the @entity58 , which wants gradual secession from @entity18 , recently swept the board in municipal elections			2
this week @entity20 prime minister @entity62 traveled to @entity63 to sign an agreement on the terms for a @entity66 due in october 2014			1
in @entity17 , meanwhile , opinion polls suggest a majority favor secession , while snap elections on 25 november are expected to return a regional parliament dominated by pro-independence parties			0
secessionist movements in @entity16 , @entity18 and the @entity20 hinge upon a heady mix of national identity , history and economics			1
@entity17 and @entity19 believe that they contribute more to national coffers than they get out			0
scottish nationalists make similar claims -- vis - à - vis @entity83 oil -- although the @entity85 government refutes that as too simplistic			0
anecdotal evidence suggests @entity89 and @entity90 nationalists are watching events in @entity3 closely			2
@entity92 , a @entity0 - based correspondent for the @entity89 newspaper @entity93 , says @entity16 politicians and commentators are particularly struck by the willingness of the @entity20 government to facilitate a referendum on @entity3 secession			1
" for @entity89 and @entity90 who defend their right to decide their own constitutional arrangements it is seen as proof of a @entity20 ' democratic maturity ' that is missing in @entity16 , " he says			1
" it is very doubtful that an agreement similar to the one announced in @entity63 on monday would be reached in @entity16 over the next two years			2
" " once the @entity3 referendum is held and the result is known , " adds @entity92 , " it would likely have again a substantial effect on attitudes in @entity16			1
" @entity34 believes relations go even deeper than keeping abreast of news developments			0
" @entity117 movements , " he says , " keep in close touch and learn from and encourage each other			0
" indeed , in @entity34 's home country of @entity124 , the @entity118 ( @entity118 ) , which recently formed a minority government in the @entity122 - speaking province , has not ruled out another referendum on secession ( there were others in 1980 and 1995 )			0
the @entity118 also maintains links with the @entity25			0
visiting @entity132 this week , @entity131 premier @entity130 said @entity3 's quest for independence " inspires us			1
" and on a trip to @entity0 last month , the veteran @entity90 nationalist @entity136 praised @entity2 while warning that @entity3 might opt for independence if the @entity139 did not devolve more power			1
the @entity25 leader has clearly studied @entity136 's style closely , echoing the @entity90 's " gradualist " approach to acquiring more powers short of full independence			1
but while the world 's nationalist leaders might monitor each other 's progress , support for secession in @entity131 , @entity3 and @entity19 remains a minority view ; only in @entity17 does it appear to total more than 50 %			1
that could , of course , change , particularly as austerity bites around the world ; nationalist movements , like political parties , rise and fall in popularity			2
some parts of the world might even be heading in the opposite direction			0
on november 6 -- the same day as the @entity166 presidential elections -- @entity167 will vote in a plebiscite on the @entity170 's constitutional status , choosing between @entity166 statehood , independence or " free association			2
" the governor , @entity174 , supports statehood as the best option for @entity167 , currently a @entity166 territory , although opinion polls are inconclusive			0
even so , the @entity5 would do well to at least clear some desk space in preparation for its 194th member .			0

secessionist movements appear to be on the rise in @entity3 , @entity16 and @entity18
new deal this week could lead to @entity3 's independence from @entity20
popular support for full independence across these regions is mixed
secessionist movements hinge upon heady mix of national identity , history and economics
