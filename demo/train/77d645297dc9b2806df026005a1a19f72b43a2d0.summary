-- say what you will about the " @entity4 " series , but you ca n't fault it for being inconsistent			2
the popular vampire franchise 's final installment , " @entity8 : breaking @entity9 -- part 2 , " scored the eighth biggest opening weekend of all time with a $ 141.3 million debut			1
if @entity15 's estimates hold up , that 's just a touch ahead of " @entity17 -- part 1 , " which started with $ 138.1 million last year , and just a touch behind @entity20 , which opened with $ 142.8 million in 2009			1
impressively , " breaking @entity9 -- part 2 " also earned $ 199.6 million in its international debut this weekend , giving it an early global total of $ 340.9 million			1
when all is said and done , the film will likely finish just above $ 700 million			2
after all , the last three twilight films — breaking @entity9 -- @entity29 1 , @entity30 , and @entity20 — earned $ 712.2 million , $ 709.8 million , and $ 698.5 million , respectively			1
like i said , it 's a remarkably consistent franchise			0
that consistency may be why @entity17 -- part 2 did n't experience an expected box office boost , despite being the grand finale of the popular franchise			0
other finales have earned substantially more on their opening weekends , drawing in casual viewers who want to be part of the pop culture moment			0
in 2011 @entity43 and the @entity44 -- part 2 opened 35 percent higher than its predecessor with $ 169.2 million			1
in 2005 @entity47 : @entity48 -- @entity48 ( which was thought to be the final @entity47 film at the time ) started with 36 percent more than its predecessor with $ 108.4 million			1
but it appears that @entity8 is a different beast			0
fans are either in — and they 've been in for a few years — or they 're not interested			0
fortunately for @entity15 ( a @entity55 company following their acquisition earlier this year ) , who spent about $ 120 million to produce @entity17 -- @entity29 2 , that cult of loyal fans is still gigantic			1
the film scored a blazing $ 34,717 per theater average from its 4,070 theaters — the best average at the entire box office			0
@entity64 are known for rushing to the theater at the first possible moment , so @entity17 -- part 2 is expected to fall quickly from here , but with the lucrative @entity70 frame coming up , it should enjoy at least one more massive weekend and climb to about $ 300 million total			1
' @entity29 ' : about that ' twist ' ... there 's still a chance that @entity17 -- part 2 could become the highest grossing @entity4 film domestically — though it seems unlikely given the fact that breaking @entity9 -- part 1 ( $ 281.3 million ) earned substantially less than @entity30 ( $ 300.5 million )			1
yet , with an " a " @entity84 grade from polled audiences , which were 79 percent female ( hilariously , the 21 percent of the audience that was male represents the highest male ratio ever for a twilight picture ) , there 's a chance that repeat viewings from super-fans could boost revenues			1
we 'll find out soon			0
last weekend 's champ , @entity95 , dipped 53 percent to $ 41.5 million in its second weekend , lifting its domestic total to $ 161.3 million after just ten days			1
the film will easily become the highest - grossing @entity99 film ever in the @entity100 over the next few days — @entity101 currently holds that distinction with $ 168.4 million			1
around the world , @entity95 , which cost @entity103 and @entity104 $ 200 million , has already become the highest grossing @entity99 ever			1
after a $ 49.6 million international frame this weekend , its overseas total stands at $ 507.9 million , and its worldwide gross has reached $ 669.2 million — easily the highest number ever for the 50 - year - old series			1
@entity112 was formerly the highest grossing @entity99 film with $ 599.2 million , but @entity95 smashed that record with ease and now looks like it will soar to at least $ 850 million			1
@entity120 , @entity119 's much buzzed - about @entity118 contender , fared well in its expansion from 11 theaters into 1,775 locations , grossing $ 21.0 million over the friday - to - sunday period			1
@entity120 opened slightly higher than fellow @entity118 front - runner @entity124 , which kicked off its run with $ 19.8 million last month ( and now has $ 92.0 million total )			2
thanks to strong reviews and an " a " cinemascore grade from audiences , 64 percent of which were 50 or older , the $ 65 million @entity129 - directed film should hold up just as well — especially because older patrons typically take their time in coming out to the theater , and the upcoming holidays frees up many working adults ' schedules to go to the movies			2
@entity129 's last film , @entity142 , which was less well - received , galloped all the way to $ 79.9 million over the holidays after a $ 7.5 million opening weekend			1
with awards season right around the corner , @entity120 could make it to $ 100 million with ease			0
' elf ' on @entity149 : @entity0 review another @entity119 film came in fourth place			0
the videogame - themed animated effort @entity153 dropped 45 percent to $ 18.3 million , and it now has $ 121.5 million total after three weekends			2
next week , the $ 165 million family film goes head - to - head with @entity160 ' animated adventure @entity159			2
rounding out the @entity161 was @entity164 's $ 31 million @entity163 vehicle , flight , which descended 42 percent to $ 8.6 million and now has $ 61.3 million total			2
the film is n't holding up quite as strong as its great reviews — and $ 24.9 million debut — suggested it would			2
this weekend flight added 565 theaters to its run ( for 2,612 total ) , yet it still dropped substantially			0
it might not make it to $ 100 million , but it will be remembered as a solid hit for all parties involved			0
the @entity4 : breaking @entity9 -- part 2 -- $ 141.3 million 2			1
@entity95 -- $ 41.5 million 3			1
@entity120 -- $ 21.0 million 4			0
@entity153 -- $ 18.3 million 5			0
flight -- $ 8.6 million two films made their debuts in limited release this weekend — both to strong , if somewhat unremarkable , results			2
the @entity184 's @entity183 , which has tried to present itself as both a romantic comedy and an @entity118 hopeful , earned $ 458,000 from 16 theaters , giving it a $ 28,625 per theater average			0
meanwhile , @entity191 ' @entity190 - directed period piece @entity188 also opened in 16 theaters , taking in an estimated $ 315,000 , good for a $ 19,688 average			0
those figures certainly sound strong , so what 's unremarkable about them ? well , consider the fact that @entity120 garnered an $ 85,846 average upon its debut in 11 theaters last weekend			0
when the film went wide this weekend , that number dropped all the way to $ 11,831 — still a strong result , but a substantial dilution that naturally occurs upon expansion			0
@entity183 and @entity188 ca n't afford to let their per theater averages drop by a similar ratio , and both will need to expand much more slowly and rely on terrific word - of - mouth to carry them to profitability			0
