@entity10 indicated a military operation could begin in the volatile @entity5 province as early as this summer , but both @entity12 and @entity10 cautioned that much political groundwork lay ahead for @entity13 - led coalition troops before an offensive can begin			1
just as in the recent @entity31 operation , the goal , they said , is to gain the support of the @entity1 people			2
" what i think we 've learned about operations in @entity1 ... is if you try to push against the culture , you have huge problems , " @entity10 said			0
" what we 're trying to achieve in @entity5 is to do the political groundwork so when it 's time to do the military operation , the significant part of the population is pulling us in and supportive so we 're not only doing what they want but we 're operating in a way that they 're comfortable with			1
that 's the key to success here			0
" @entity10 said the goal " is to demonstrate again that we can operate in a way where we 've got strong resolve by the government of @entity1 , effective performance by the @entity1 military and coalition partners , and government partners , so that as we do an operation that shows the people of @entity5 , and the @entity61 as well , that operations like this actually result in a better outcome for everyone			2
