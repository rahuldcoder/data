@entity1 's purchase on monday of the photo - sharing app @entity4 had the @entity5 asking one question : will the @entity7 of social networking make @entity4 so uncool or so @entity1 - y that it dies off entirely ? immediately after the reported $ 1 billion purchase was announced , some digi - pundits were already rushing to say just that -- with plenty offering advice on how @entity4 users can delete their accounts and all of the photos they 've uploaded with the app. some cited @entity1 - related privacy concerns			1
that line of thinking goes like this : @entity4 , a mobile network where people share filter - altered , hipster - y photos with friends , feels small and intimate			1
by contrast , @entity1 feels too big and tries harder to profit off of the data its users submit to the site			2
here are a couple tweets to that effect : @ thisbrokenwheel : " well , i guess i 'll be spending the evening deleting all of my posted photos from @ @entity4			0
hate @entity1 's creepy privacy issues			0
" @ sinabhfuil : " must delete @entity4 from my phone ; do n't want any sneaking doorways into @entity1 privacy grabs " will @entity1 's purchase help or hurt @entity4 ? share thoughts as @entity42 writes , @entity4 had n't monetized its app : " @entity4 is a free app and does n't charge for any of its services			1
the company 's founders insisted that would come in time , once they 'd built a sizeable user base			0
" the tech blog @entity51 posted instructions for users to delete their entire @entity4 accounts , just so @entity1 ca n't get its hands on any data about their relationships on @entity4 or on the photos they 've submitted through the app. " there is no guarantee that @entity1 will be using the data gathered by @entity4 but we would n't bet against it in a million years , " that blog writes			1
others think the app will become far less cool under @entity1 's care : @ @entity70 : " what was once great is now crap			2
" " a lot of users will stop using @entity4 , " predicted @entity72 of @entity73 , @entity74 , who posted a photo protesting the @entity1 takeover			1
and there was quite a bit of non-analytical digital freakout happening : " @entity83 ! " @ _ @entity84 wrote			0
another @entity86 user said the app wo n't die , but it will wane in popularity over time : @ jameshritz : " for me , i wo n't ever delete or quit , it will just be a process of gradual abandonment ( probably take a few months ) ... " still others are waiting for more details			0
in a posting on his @entity1 page , ceo @entity96 said @entity1 will let @entity4 operate as an " independent " entity -- albeit one that is owned by his social networking company			2
@entity4 's 30 million - plus users still will be able to post photos to various online social networks , he said			1
that feature is one hallmark of @entity4 , and another reason it became so popular , particularly in tech early adopter circles			1
with a single click , users can share photos on @entity86 , @entity1 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			1
" we think the fact that @entity4 is connected to other services beyond @entity1 is an important part of the experience , " @entity96 wrote on his @entity1 page			2
" we plan on keeping features like the ability to post to other social networks , the ability to not share your @entity123 on @entity1 if you want , and the ability to have followers and follow people separately from your friends on @entity1			2
" these and many other features are important parts of the @entity4 experience and we understand that			0
we will try to learn from @entity4 's experience to build similar features into our other products			0
at the same time , we will try to help @entity4 continue to grow by using @entity1 's strong engineering team and infrastructure			2
" color filters in the app also make anyone 's mobile - phone photos look instantly more professional and vintage			1
in comments on @entity96 's post , plenty of @entity1 users appeared to be thrilled about the integration			0
" this is damn interesting ! ! @entity151 ! , " one user wrote			0
" woah ... so cool ! great news for @entity153 + @entity154 : ) " another said			0
here 's perhaps the most compelling comment on that post , as it hints at the increased popularity @entity4 could see as it joins up with a network that is expected to hit 1 billion people this year : " now i do n't have to explain what @entity4 is to my @entity162			1
i can just say ' it 's @entity1 ! ' " one @entity1 user wrote .			0

@entity1 buys @entity4 , the mobile photo - sharing app , for $ 1 billion
digital pundits worry @entity4 could lose its cool
the photo - sharing app is popular with tech early adopters
it lets users apply color filters to photos and share them on *multiple* networks
