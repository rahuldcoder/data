@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was 4am when , still half asleep , we bundled ourselves into a van and headed to the southern @entity1 city of @entity7			1
we had spent the night in @entity8 , famous for its giant stairway featured in @entity12 's 1925 silent film , " @entity13			2
" and while we had n't awoken before the sparrows just to go sightseeing , our diligent fixers unexpectedly took us on a tour of the apparent back streets of @entity8			1
they assured us it was the quickest way out of town , but i was anxious because we had just three and a half hours to reach @entity7 where we 'd be joining the 43 observers from the @entity26 ( @entity27 ) international observer team as they attempted to cross into @entity29			1
the delegates were all from various militaries			2
punctuality had been drilled into them			2
they would not wait for a late television crew , even if we had been given exclusive access to their convoy			2
when we arrived in @entity7 , the @entity27 observers were getting a briefing about their planned route to @entity29			1
are you in @entity29 ? share your story with @entity44			1
yes , they expected to meet armed @entity47 military forces			2
no , they did not like their chances of getting through , but it was their mission to try			2
for almost three hours , we drove in a police - escorted convoy through sparse countryside and dilapidated @entity56 - era towns			2
it was a joy to see the @entity58 but at the same time , i felt some trepidation as it indicated we were approaching the @entity62 checkpoint and we really did n't know what to expect			1
we knew the men guarding the checkpoints up ahead were armed with assault rifles			2
the @entity27 delegates we were travelling with were not carrying weapons and the @entity29 authorities had made it clear they regarded any attempts by the @entity27 to enter the peninsula as a provocation			1
the team of observers had already been blocked on a different route to @entity29 the previous day			1
this was their second attempt			2
one delegate told me he was anxious about trying again			2
another said the delegation needed to be more forceful this time			2
at first our convoy was met with celebratory scenes of people waving @entity1 flags but the atmosphere changed further down the road as we approached the @entity62 roadblock			1
the men guarding it were indeed armed and wore balaclavas and military fatigues with no insignia			2
they stood below @entity97 flags			0
along the roadside , signs warned of land mines			0
while the armed guards looked threatening , they were remarkably calm as they faced not only repeated demands from the @entity27 observers but were taunted by @entity106 protesters who had followed our convoy			1
" this is our country			0
we will kill you , " shouted a particularly irate elderly man			0
a shake of the head was the only response he got from one of the masked guards			0
for two hours , the @entity27 officials repeatedly pressed their case , insisting they had a right to enter @entity29 , but eventually they decided their efforts were futile			1
the armed men would not budge			0
the weather was turning foul			0
the delegates turned their convoy around and headed back to @entity7 to assess their next move			1
we , however , stayed on			0
our man and wife fixer team had suggested they try to get us into @entity29			1
and they were successful but not before a hairy moment			0
as we waited to be waved through , two shots were fired			0
up ahead , we could see gunfire smoke near a car waiting to pass from @entity29 into @entity1			1
the @entity136 forces manning the checkpoint immediately assumed defensive positions and stood back to back , weapons at the ready			1
but they remained calm , relaxed even			0
these masked men may not be wearing insignia but their discipline indicated that they had military training			0
after a few minutes , they waved us through			0
as we passed the white sedan that had been shot at , we could see that no one in the vehicle was hurt , but the front tire had been shot out			0
hostile reactions in @entity29 after five days in @entity29 , our team was due to head back to @entity151			1
but on the eve of our departure , @entity153 airport was closed to all flights except those to and from @entity158			0
we would have to look for alternatives			0
by car or by rail			0
a road trip would mean at least 10 hours of driving with no guarantee we would get through the checkpoints set up by @entity136 forces between the @entity29 peninsula and @entity1 mainland			1
we had witnessed one of these gunmen shoot out the tires of a vehicle trying to cross into @entity1 at a checkpoint in @entity62			1
we did n't want to risk a similar situation			0
during our travels through the region , reaction to our cameras was n't always positive			0
in @entity8 we faced some aggression and were told that some @entity47 activists did not look favorably on @entity181 - owned networks			0
so with road travel struck off the list , we turned to the train timetables			1
so it seemed , had everyone else wanting to get out			0
the @entity151 - bound service was booked out but we managed to snare the last tickets on a train to @entity0 , another region in eastern @entity1 which identifies more strongly with @entity158 than @entity151			1
so we boarded the @entity190 express at 7.55 p.m. and immediately negotiated our way into first class to accommodate the 12 bags of camera equipment and personal luggage that we 'd been dragging around the countryside from @entity151 , to @entity8 , to @entity153 and @entity198 for the past seven days			1
the train conductor kindly gave up her two - bunk cabin for us and no doubt spent a restless night in an upright chair			1
that 's not to suggest that we slept any more soundly			0
the heating was turned up to asteroid temperature and our kindly conductor woke us at 2 am to fetch her cigarettes that she 'd left in the cabin			2
i guess she needed something to get her through the discomfort			0
still , it was a markedly better and safer way to travel than by car			0
the carriages were full of young families and senior citizens heading to the @entity1 ahead of sunday 's referendum , there was a plentiful supply of tea with lemon and sugar , and at $ 15 for a standard ticket and $ 40 for first class , it was a bargain			1
it was also hassle - free			0
despite reports of @entity136 forces inspecting trains in @entity29 , our only visitor was a young mute man who wanted to sell us night lights			1
we are now all proud owners of these small glowing souvenirs of a journey that may have left us parched from the heat , but which gave us one of the few remaining routes out of @entity29			1
at least until after the referendum on sunday .			0

@entity2 team joins international observers trying to get into @entity29 from @entity1
they are turned away at a checkpoint but the @entity2 team later makes it over the border
after five days , they have to decide the safest way to get back again -- and decide on the train
