-- you 've spent weeks , months , maybe years , planning this day			1
from the moment that one ( or both ) of you said " yes ! " it 's been a whirlwind of wardrobe fittings , seating charts , cake tastings , envelope stuffings , raised glasses and perhaps a teary meltdown or two			1
now all that stands between you and your soon - to - be lawfully wedded spouse ( who is looking more gorgeous today than ever ) is a few yards of aisle			1
and all of a sudden , that seems like the longest walk of your lifetime			1
even those of us who are hazy on some details of our wedding day recall exactly how we got to our beloved 's side , and who accompanied us there			1
whether it 's expressed in a beloved song , an unconventional companion or creative transportation , the long trip down the aisle is an opportunity to make your wedding day unique			1
for many people in the western world , @entity41 's " @entity40 " from the 1850 opera " @entity42 " is the music by which the great stride occurs			1
those getting married in the @entity44 ( which does n't cotton to the inclusion of secular music in a religious ceremony ) are n't presented with a suite of approved music , but according to a quote often attributed to @entity52 , " he who sings prays twice			1
" accordingly , the happy couple is asked to consider a few criteria from @entity56 catechism in making their song selections : three principal criteria : beauty that is expressive of prayer , participation of the assembled ( everybody sing along ! ) , and solemnity befitting the occasion			1
that considerably slims down the songbook , but hey -- there 's always the reception			1
for the rest of us , the world is our jukebox , and that can be a daunting decision			1
it 's a moment that sets a tone for the ceremony , the crowd and possibly even the marriage itself			1
a video from the wedding procession of @entity84 and @entity85 went viral in 2009 and has been viewed more than 84 million times on @entity87 since			1
the " @entity88 " -- which was later recreated by characters in an episode of the sitcom " @entity92 " -- involved members of the wedding party dancing down the aisle , followed by the tumbling groom , and eventually the beaming , bobbing bride			1
sales of their processional song , " forever " skyrocketed as the video 's popularity soared -- but the perception of the artist , @entity108 , came crashing back down to @entity109 as allegations of abuse against his on - again - off - again girlfriend @entity99 surfaced			1
@entity113 and @entity84 took action and set up an initiative for donations and ad dollars to be contributed to the @entity118 , which works to end domestic violence			2
according to an update on the couples ' website , as of august 1 , 2013 , $ 47,641 had been raised for the cause			2
but it 's a rare couple that undergoes that sort of musical scrutiny			2
for most , song choice is a deeply personal decision , based on shared experiences , values , the ceremony 's aesthetics and old favorites -- and it 's plain old fun to engage in			2
for @entity137 , that song was " @entity139 " from @entity141 's " @entity140 , " strummed by a harpist as her 10 - year - old niece , @entity143 , accompanied her on the walk			1
@entity137 explained , " my father died in 1989 and the thought of getting married and walking down the aisle alone always terrified me			1
i swore to myself i would never , ever get married			2
but , when i met the love of my life in 2005 , my fears were replaced with love and trust			2
" the song still brings tears to her eyes whenever she hears it , @entity137 said			2
" say you need me with you now and always			2
promise me that all you say is true			2
love me , that 's all i ask of you			2
then say you 'll share with me one love , one lifetime			2
let me lead you from your solitude			2
say you need me with you here beside you , anywhere you go , let me go , too			2
that 's all i ask of you			2
... " @entity163 found a more raucous reflection of her path to the altar in the @entity168 song " @entity169			0
" she explained , " because of a nasty divorce between our parents , my brother and i really raised each other growing up			0
because of this , i felt it fitting that my brother , two years younger , escorted me to the aisle where i then walked by myself to my waiting husband			1
" the song , which is in a more melodic style than bandleader @entity183 's usual industrial style , featured lyrics ( which translate from the @entity185 to " when the day comes , i will become the sky and the sea , and the sea will come to kiss me , for i am going home , and nothing can stop me " ) that @entity186 felt were " a perfect marriage of music and meaning " and embodied her feelings toward her husband , who was raised near the sea			0
" through marriage we were becoming one and creating our home , " she said			0
@entity202 looked to her second aisle walk as a chance to right the past			1
at age 22 , she had almost vomited and fled the scene			0
" my father gripped my arm and said , ' we can make a run for it , ' " she said , " but the music started playing , the bills were paid and everyone was already there			0
so , i made my way towards my groom			0
" five years later , things hit a sour note and the divorced @entity202 vowed not to get married -- or spend so much money -- ever again			0
that was before she met @entity223			0
she walked down the aisle solo that time , after knowing her now - husband for just a few months			1
" i am an adult and i did n't feel like i was being given away , " @entity202 said			1
" i wanted that moment to be oniy about us , just as our marriage would be			0
i chose to walk down the aisle to ' @entity230 ' ( the @entity232 version of the @entity234 version ) , which is my absolute favorite song			1
" key lyrics : " i 've told the truth , i did n't come to fool you			1
and even though it all went wrong , i 'll stand before the lord of song			0
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah			0
" wedding decorator @entity243 has gussied up the nuptials of hundreds of celebrities and hifalutin couples around the globe , but his own -- at age 64 to partner @entity248 -- was the first same - sex ceremony he 'd crafted			0
and it had to stand out			0
at midnight on february 13 , 2013 , @entity243 rang in @entity254 by rolling down the aisle hidden inside a 10 - foot , @entity253 - designed sculpture as @entity248 sang " @entity256 " and then " now we are free " from the movie " gladiator " played			1
the structure featured a body double of @entity243 at the top wearing a voluminous wedding gown			0
" when my guests first saw my body double rolling down the aisle wearing a 10 foot dress , they thought it was me , completely losing my mind , " @entity243 said			1
" as the structure got closer to the altar , i opened the bottom of the dress and casually walked out , bouquet in hand			0
this entrance set the tone for an evening of fun and laughter			0
i could n't have wanted anything more for the night , " he recalled			1
( no doubt this was amplified and encouraged by the presence of officiant @entity285			0
) for my now - husband and me , the march was an opportunity to explore the songs that were touchstones for us both -- and a chance for our friends to participate			1
our pick : the instrumental @entity296 version of " @entity297			0
" while the words would not be sung aloud , we both ( along with most of our guests ) knew what they were : " @entity302 for a change			0
... so for once in my life , let me get what i want			0
" he took his place at the altar to the tune originally recorded by @entity310 , and i walked in ( with my @entity313 wolfhound , @entity314 , at my side so my dad could tend to my disabled mother ) to a duo of musician friends singing @entity321 ' " @entity320			0
" key lyrics : " the book of love has music in it			0
in fact , that 's where music comes from			0
some of it is just transcendental			0
some of it is just really dumb			0
... but @entity331 , i love it when you give me things			0
and you , you ought to give me wedding rings			0
" not a dry eye in the house -- especially not mine -- and every single time i hear that song , i stop what i 'm doing and simply listen and remember			0
what was playing as you walked down the aisle , and were you solo or accompanied ? please share your story in the comments below .			1

many stick with *traditional* options like the " @entity40 " for their walk down the aisle
others choose artists and songs that reflect their relationship
it is n't always a parent accompanying their child down the aisle
some choose a sibling , other relative , pet or a solo stroll
