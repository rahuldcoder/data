@entity0 -- the acting inspector general of the @entity3 is investigating the @entity5 prostitution scandal in @entity6 , in addition to four congressional committees as well as internal reviews by the agency , the military and the @entity12			1
the top legislators on the @entity14 said tuesday they sent a letter to @entity5 director @entity16 asking for information on the incident last month in @entity19 , @entity6 , that has resulted in nine agents resigning or in the process of being forced out			1
three other @entity5 agents were cleared of serious misconduct , and the military is investigating the alleged involvement of 12 service members			1
on monday , the homeland security official announced his separate investigation of the incident , which embarrassed the government and raised questions of a possible security breach before president @entity33 arrived for the @entity34			1
the " field work is beginning immediately , " acting inspector general @entity35 said in a statement			1
meanwhile , @entity16 faced a pair of deadlines tuesday to answer dozens of questions about the issue			0
@entity43 chairman @entity42 , @entity45 - @entity44 , submitted 50 questions to @entity16 , while @entity48 chairman @entity47 and rep. @entity49 , the panel 's ranking @entity50 , have 10 questions they wanted answered , including a precise time line of exactly what happened in @entity19			2
" the incident in @entity19 is troubling because @entity5 agents and officers made a range of bad decisions , " said a letter from @entity47 , @entity57 , and @entity49 of @entity58			2
the pair also sent a letter to defense secretary @entity66 requesting details of the military investigation by may 8			0
in their correspondence to @entity66 , @entity47 and @entity49 said security personnel showed an " alarming lack " of " character " and " judgment			0
" the @entity75 questioned homeland security secretary @entity76 about the controversy at a hearing last week			1
on tuesday , sen. @entity79 , an independent from @entity81 who chairs the @entity83 , and ranking @entity85 sen. @entity84 said they sent @entity16 a letter monday that also sought answers about what happened			0
" we wish to determine whether those events were indicative of a pattern of behavior by agents or officers of the @entity5 , and need to be addressed systemically , or if they instead constituted an isolated incident warranting action only with respect to the individuals involved , " said the letter from @entity79 and @entity90			2
the @entity104 expects to finish questioning the 12 military personnel implicated in possible wrongdoing this week before forwarding its findings to military lawyers for review , and then to gen. @entity111 , commanding general of the @entity104 , a @entity103 official said monday			1
last week , the @entity5 distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct , according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation			2
called @entity122 , the new guidelines given to all @entity5 personnel make clear that standards of behavior required in the @entity125 apply on missions abroad , the sources said			1
effective immediately , the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are " off limits " for @entity5 personnel , the sources said			2
also in the new standards , foreigners are banned from @entity5 hotel rooms at all times , except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business , according to the officials , and all @entity5 personnel are prohibited from going to a " nonreputable establishment			0
" the new standards specify that @entity125 laws apply to @entity5 personnel when traveling , rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country , the officials said			1
in addition , the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty , but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying , the officials explained			0
an additional supervisor from the @entity163 will now accompany the " jump teams " that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation , the officials said			0
agents involved in the @entity6 incident were part of such a jump team			2
allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes last month before @entity33 arrived in @entity19			0
recent claims include an account from @entity180 described by @entity1 affiliate @entity181 station @entity182 as very similar to the @entity6 scandal , involving members of the @entity5 and other government agencies			1
however , @entity66 said last week that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in @entity180 , while @entity190 spokesman @entity189 said embassy staff in @entity180 were being questioned about the allegations the @entity197 also is prepared to look into , " in an appropriate manner and immediately , " allegations that it deems " credible " regarding its agents in @entity180 , agency spokesman @entity193 said			0
but he added that , while the @entity197 had seen news reports , " we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct			0
" @entity1 's @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
