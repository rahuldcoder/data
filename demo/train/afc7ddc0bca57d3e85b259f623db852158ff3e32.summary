@entity0 -- airline pilots who want to skip certain airport screening measures -- saying it 's wasteful to search pilots for sharp objects when they can bring down planes with their bare hands -- are finally getting their way			1
the @entity10 announced friday that it is taking steps to streamline screening for @entity14 airline pilots			1
pilots traveling in uniform on airline business will be allowed to bypass normal security screening by presenting screeners with their airline @entity20 and another form of identification , the @entity10 said			1
the screeners will check the information against a secure , real - time airline crew member database , which includes a picture and other information to verify the pilots ' employment status , the @entity10 said			1
pilots will be subject to random screening and other layers of security , the @entity10 said			1
the @entity10 said the changes will take effect immediately while it phases in a more permanent system			0
pilots have long argued that it is a waste of costly security resources to check pilots for restricted objects			2
thousands of pilots , they note , are licensed to carry firearms in cockpits under the government 's @entity48 program			2
@entity51 spent checking pilots would be better spent checking others , they say			2
" airline pilots are the last line of defense against someone who would use an airplane for ill. and we need to be a trusted partner in our security efforts , " retired @entity55 pilot @entity54 told @entity1 earlier this week			1
" you know , many pilots are already armed as deputized and trained flight deck officers to defend the cockpit			0
and so really it 's a waste of our limited resources to put airline pilots who are trusted partners in this through this screening			1
" @entity10 administrator @entity75 said the change " just makes for smart security and an efficient use of our resources			0
" the change also will likely squelch pilot complaints about going through full - body scanners , some of which emit low levels of radiation			0
the @entity10 says the scanners are safe , exposing people to about the same amount of radiation they would get by flying for about two minutes at altitude			0
but pilots have become alarmed by some doctors who say not enough is known about the machines			0
recently , a pilots union encouraged its members to avoid the devices			0
on friday , pilots unions called the announcement a welcome change			1
for the past three years , the @entity10 has tested an electronic pilot identification screening system called @entity102 , or crew @entity103			2
the @entity10 said friday that @entity102 will continue to operate at the test sites : @entity110 - @entity109 , @entity111 , and @entity112 ( @entity108 ) @entity107 airports .			0

pilots will now present airline @entity20 and another form of identification
they will still be subject to random screening and other layers of security
pilots unions welcome the announcement
