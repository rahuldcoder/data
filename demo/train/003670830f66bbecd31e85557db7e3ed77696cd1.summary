-- a colleague of mine cringes every time he 's introduced as a sports journalist			2
" please , just call me a journalist , " he said the other day			2
" i do n't want anyone to think i 'm a sloppy sports reporter			2
" you see , he wants no association with the fantastical @entity11 soap opera			1
and after working as a sports journalist myself for nearly 15 years , i feel his pain			2
it has n't been the best year for sportswriters , who 've been caught unaware and downright out - hustled on some of the biggest sports stories : the sex abuse case of former @entity21 assistant football coach @entity20 sat untouched for years by sportswriters until it was uncovered by a dogged , young crime reporter , @entity23 ( who works for @entity0 now )			1
@entity24 , one of the biggest names in sports , was able to silence writers around him who whispered throughout his seven consecutive @entity28 wins that he was racing dirty			1
when he was finally caught by the @entity29 after the evidence and witnesses grew too loud to deny , he gave his widely watched confession to @entity33 , who is not exactly a sports insider			2
and now , it 's @entity36 to the rescue , delivering the first on - camera interview with @entity11 since his fake love story was exposed by the sports blog @entity41			1
maybe @entity36 can explain how media giants as savvy as @entity43 and @entity44 were conned about the @entity47 star linebacker 's tragic tale of a beautiful girlfriend , @entity48 , who slipped into a coma after a terrible car crash and later died of leukemia on the eve of one of the biggest games of the season			0
despite his grief , @entity11 helped lead the @entity57 to a 20 - 3 victory over @entity59			1
sounds like a perfect script for a @entity62 movie , and just as make - believe			2
the girl did n't exist			0
according to @entity11 , he 'd been catfished -- tricked by friends who played an online prank against him and made up the girl he met online and fell in love with , though they 'd never met in person			1
failed to do their job , which is not simply to entertain fans and promote the games we love , but to inform , illuminate and deliver factual information			1
call me old - school , but i think journalists owe it to readers and viewers to make certain , to the best of our ability , that the news we deliver is accurate			1
does n't the public trust still matter , or , is our work just all for entertainment these days ? " we got , got , " said @entity93 , award - winning editor and chief of the @entity95			1
" this is a wake - up call for us to remember not to take shortcuts			1
we always have to ask tough questions and confirm all the facts ourselves , even if they 've already been reported by other media			0
" @entity93 is no lightweight			0
he 's mentored hundreds of sports journalists , some of the best in the business			1
when he was my editor at the @entity108 , he was constantly on my case			0
" @entity115 , get in here , " he 'd bark at me from his office door if he found even one comma out of place in a story i 'd edited , or a fact that did n't quite add up			1
people lie to reporters all the time			2
we 're a nosy bunch , often asking questions others think are none of our business			0
sometimes the questions are personal , oftentimes they are painful			0
i 'm sure it can get annoying			0
but our job is to probe			2
we know that politicians sometimes lie			0
criminals rarely admit they 've done the crime			0
and , yes , even star athletes have been known to exaggerate the facts			0
so in these multitasking times that require reporters and editors to blog , tweet , write and rush to break stories on - air , it 's also necessary to be a skeptic and remember the basics			1
working in sports is a dream job most days			1
we meet fascinating people , mingle with superstars , travel the world and go to games for free			0
and most of us actually like the people we write about , but there 's a danger in getting so close to our sources that we shy away from pushing them on the facts for fear we 'll lose a story			2
asking a tough question or verifying the information through independent sources is not insulting , or insensitive , it 's our job			2
just a few simple questions in the @entity11 story could have sniffed out the falsehoods			1
there was no obituary or death certificate for @entity168			0
no record of any car crash			0
no reporter had ever met her or spoken with anyone in her family			0
and @entity175 had no record of her ever attending school and playing on the volleyball team , as @entity11 had told reporters			1
following up on these alleged facts would not have been investigative journalism , just routine fact - checking on a story that seemed innocent on the surface			1
i just hope @entity36 can help to put an end to @entity188 for us all			0
it 's time to move on to more important news			0
i 've got @entity192 picks to make : i 'll take the @entity193 by 13			0
forget the facts , who cares that @entity196 are favored by 3.5 points ? that 's my fantasy and i 'm going with it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

@entity203 : sports reporters missed the big stories : @entity11 , @entity20 , @entity24
@entity115 : sports journalists failed to do their job , which is to report , not just entertain fans
@entity115 : just routine fact - checking on the @entity11 story could have sniffed out falsehoods
she says sports reporters must first be reporters , and remember public trust matters
