-- @entity1 have confirmed they are pulling out of @entity2 , unless a buyer for the team can be found by the end of the month , blaming the global financial crisis for their decision			1
@entity8 , left , and @entity9 could be out of a job following @entity1 's withdrawal from @entity2			1
chief executive @entity12 announced at a news conference in @entity14 that the company would be willing to sell the team and will withdraw from the 2009 competition if no buyer is found by the end of decemebr -- ending the @entity22 car giant 's nine - year involvement in the sport			1
" we , @entity24 , have come to the conclusion that we will withdraw from all @entity2 activities , making 2008 the last season of our participation , " said @entity12			1
" this difficult decision has been made in light of the quickly deteriorating operating environment facing the global auto industry , brought on by the sub-prime problem in the @entity35 , the deepening credit crisis and the sudden contraction of the world economies			2
" @entity1 must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economies around the globe continue to mount			2
a recovery is expected to take some time , " he added			0
it is understood the 600 members of staff at @entity50 , near the @entity51 in @entity52 , were told job losses would be likely , even if a buyer was found for the team			1
the news also leaves drivers @entity8 and @entity9 facing an uncertain future , with spare places in rival teams few and far between			1
@entity1 's demise would also reduce the @entity2 grid to just 18 cars ( nine teams ) and would see them become the second team to fold this year following @entity67 's closure early in the season			1
despite a huge operational budget of $ 300 million , @entity1 have under - achieved in the sport , finishing ninth out of 10 in the constructors ' standings with @entity9 14th and @entity8 18th out of the 20 drivers			1
@entity75 are dealing with faltering sales worldwide and the @entity2 team is not the only casualty			2
on thursday , 490 temporary employees were told they would be laid off at the end of january , while last month 270 temporary employees were informed their contracts were not being renewed			0
@entity83 , president of @entity2 's governing body , the @entity84 , said @entity1 's withdrawal had confirmed his " longstanding concern that the cost of competing in the world championship is unsustainable			1
" read more about @entity83 's past warnings @entity83 sent a letter to the remaining teams urging them to accept cost - cutting moves including smaller , more fuel - efficient engines , which he estimated would shave up to $ 60 million off the expense of running a team beginning in the 2010 season			2
" in the @entity84 's view , the global economic downturn has only exacerbated an already critical situation , " @entity83 said			0
" what has happened to @entity1 is very sad because obviously it involves a lot of jobs and they are a key player in @entity2 , but i have to say it was not entirely unexpected , " he added			1
" i 've been expecting one of the major manufacturers to stop for some time because even before the current situation the costs were completely out of control			0
now it 's difficult to imagine how any manufacturer could stay in the sport unless we make really substantial reductions in costs			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 team principal @entity118 remains confident a suitable new owner could still be found			1
the former @entity121 technical director told @entity122 : " it 's a fantastic opportunity for someone to step into what will be a very competitive team next year			0
" the facilities here are one of the best in @entity2 , the workforce is definitely one of the best in @entity2 and we have got a great car design for next year			2
" i think it would be unfortunate for @entity2 if this had a domino effect on other teams			2
i hope that does n't happen but all the teams are having to face up to this economic environment			0
" @entity2 unfortunately has a certain inertia and it is difficult to change things quickly because of the regulations			0
if a car factory gets into difficulty it can close down for a few months , stop production			0
we ca n't do that			0
we have races to go to and schedules to meet			0
" it is very difficult to turn the tap off in @entity2 overnight but i think the things that are being done now can really make a difference next year and in 2010			0

@entity1 say they are pulling out of @entity2 unless a buyer for the team can be found
@entity22 *carmaker* will quit in december , blaming global financial pressures
the decision means only 18 cars and nine teams will line up on the 2009 grid
