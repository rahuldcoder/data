-- @entity1 have won the @entity3 title for a fifth successive season -- and the 18th time in their illustrious history -- after @entity7 's goal gave them a 1 - 0 win at @entity9 on sunday			1
@entity11 's side needed nothing less than a victory to secure the @entity14 and they achieved that feat in the 57th - minute when striker @entity7 collected a pass from fellow - @entity18 @entity17 , before firing home a shot with the outside of his right foot			1
a draw would have allowed second - placed @entity24 to snatch the title with a win at @entity27 and @entity29 's side kept up their side of the deal with a 2 - 0 success			1
@entity33 volleyed home @entity35 's through - ball in the 39th minute and @entity37 international @entity35 added a second on the stroke of half - time with a superb long - range strike			0
with only 45 minutes remaining of the season , @entity24 were in pole position to win their first title since 2001 -- but @entity7 's strike ensured @entity1 became the first team since @entity47 in the 1930 's to win five titles on the bounce			1
the result , which condemned @entity9 to relegation to @entity52 alongside @entity53 and @entity54 , also means @entity1 will now face @entity55 in next weekend 's @entity57 final in @entity58 with both sides bidding for a unique treble			2
" this is an incredible joy , a reward for all the hard work we 've put in over the year , " @entity7 told reporters			0
" from tomorrow we will think about that great champions @entity67 final			0
" like the @entity70 giants , @entity1 have now added the league title to their domestic cup triumph -- and saturday 's @entity74 showdown now ensures one of the two teams will secure a rare treble of trophies this season			2
for @entity11 , who has overseen @entity1 's last two @entity82 wins , there is the added incentive of joining a select band of coaches to have won the @entity57 with two different clubs , following his success with @entity89 in 2004 .			0

@entity1 win the @entity3 title for a fifth successive year after *beating* @entity9 1 - 0
@entity7 *scores* the only goal as @entity1 add the @entity94 to their @entity96 triumph
@entity24 finish two points behind in second position after a 2 - 0 victory at @entity27
