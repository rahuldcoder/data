-- pale , blond and blue - eyed , the 4 - year - old girl looks shyly into the camera			1
this is no ordinary photo , though			0
the little girl pictured is at the center of a mystery			0
police in @entity10 say they found her thursday with a @entity12 couple posing as her parents but have no idea who she is or where her real parents are			1
they hope releasing the pictures of her might prompt people to come forward with information			0
the girl was discovered during a search of a home in a community of @entity12 , also known as gypsies , near the town of @entity29 in central @entity10 , police said			1
photo blog : the plight of the @entity12 police first became suspicious because the girl , who is blonde with very pale skin and blue eyes , did not resemble the couple who claimed to be her parents			1
when the couple were then questioned , " they changed repeatedly their story about how they got the child , " a police statement said , compounding the officers ' suspicions			2
dna testing then " showed that there was not any genetic compatibility " between the girl and the 39 - year - old man and the 40 - year - old woman , the police said , meaning they can not be her biological parents			1
the girl was immediately taken from the couple and entrusted to the care of a charity called @entity58			1
the charity said it would look after her " until a solution in the best interest of the child is found			2
" the two people posing as her parents have been arrested and face charges of abducting a minor , as well as counts of falsifying identity documents , said the state - owned @entity69			1
among the suspect documents found by police was a 2009 birth and baptism registration from @entity76 authorities , the news agency said			2
the 40 - year - old woman also had two different valid identification documents and , based on family registration records , appears to have given birth to three children between june and november 1993 , and another three children between october 1994 and february 1995 , it said			0
in fact , the state - run @entity69 news agency reported this woman had two family residence registrations indicating she was mother to 10 children -- five girls and a boy in @entity29 , plus four girls in @entity90			1
the 39 - year - old man is registered as the father of four more children			1
@entity10 's government has promised to help the child			0
in the meantime , the little girl is being given support by a police psychologist , the police said			0
anyone with information is asked to call the @entity103 hotline for @entity104 or contact @entity58			0
the girl 's discovery will likely prompt speculation she may have been abducted or trafficked -- which , if proven , could serve to fuel prejudice against the @entity12 community within @entity10 and elsewhere			2
rights group @entity110 has called on the @entity111 to take action to end discrimination against the 6 million @entity12 , describing them as " the largest and most disadvantaged minority in the region			0
" in may , @entity110 said @entity10 had been found guilty of discrimination against @entity12 schoolchildren in three separate rulings by the @entity119			0
@entity0 's @entity120 and journalist @entity121 contributed to this report .			0
