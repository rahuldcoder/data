take one look at these images and you experience a range of city - life emotions			1
you feel the noonday sun beating down on your back , surging waves of people on every side of you			2
you sip your overpriced beverage and stare into the distance for a reprieve from the crowds and from a morning spent on your feet			0
you see long shadows and you hear the quiet : the exhale of a city that 's been running hard and long all day -- the settling down , the withdrawal of vendors and businessmen and every sort of tradesmen in between			1
@entity29 photographer @entity27 is interested in these interactions , and by isolating them he examines " the mask that people are wearing on the streets , and things like the gaze -- who 's looking at who ? " what do these small gestures on the street tell us about the human condition ? " @entity44 asked			1
" how do people feel and how do people respond to ( each other ) ? " @entity27 was trained as a classical photographer and spent time after graduation shooting stills on film sets			1
influenced by the lighting techniques from the cinema , he had the idea : " why not bring the light to the streets ? " " after that , " he said , " the street became a studio and the people became the actors			2
" he started in @entity63 three years ago when he had this idea			0
" i was fascinated by this theme of the ' urban millennium , ' " he said			2
" what 's going to happen when cities get more busy and people have to live in a smaller space ? " the urban millennium references the announcement , made by the @entity74 @entity73 in 2007 , that " more people ( are ) living in cities than in rural areas : 3.3 billion people ( are ) on three percent of the earth 's surface			1
" during his time in @entity63 , @entity27 made a blueprint for where he would go next to continue this documentary work : @entity85 , @entity86 ; @entity87 , @entity88 ; @entity89 , @entity90 ; and @entity91			1
he is now stationed in @entity93 , continuing the project while he pursues a master 's in photography and urban cultures			2
when deciding what city to focus on for his project , there are three determining factors , he said : " speed and scale of urbanization , size of economy , and population density			2
" once arriving in a new city , @entity27 brings passion for his work , and grit and determination carry him through long days standing on dusty and crowded street corners			1
" i find these places interesting , because this is where the personality and character and the desires that people have come up in places where the population density is very high , " he said			2
" you really see what they 're thinking in those places , and small gestures have a lot of information about what we think about ourselves and what we think of each other			0
" @entity27 brings small flashes with him and sets them up on whatever is available , be it light posts , poles or railings			1
then he waits for the perfect moments			0
nothing is staged ; it 's all a candid flow of human interaction			2
the most subtle gaze or movement speaks volumes in a still image			0
@entity27 does his best to be invisible so that people will act naturally and not pose for the camera			1
the dramatic lighting makes for a very theatrical end product			0
running late for the bus suddenly becomes an epic dash through dappled sunlight and illuminated sheet - metal buildings			0
" the camera made me curious in the world , and the camera is a great way to explore places and people , " @entity44 said			1
" and it can open doors in a lot of situations			0
" social media follow @ @entity170 on @entity171 to join the conversation about photography			0
@entity27 asks thoughtful questions of society by holding up a mirror and inviting honest examination			1
" what kind of cities are we creating , and in the end are we creating an ideal world ? those are the big themes i like to touch with my work			1
and the themes i like to raise questions about , " he said			0
" it 's very difficult to find those answers in photography ; it 's hard to see the progress of the city in someone 's eyes			1
i 'm very much interested in the people in there , in the social behavior of the group			0
" these questions are the driving force that propels @entity27 's work			1
exploring the dynamics of the streets			0
capturing a moment in time that you can delve into and resonate with on a very human level			0
just pictures of people on the street ? yes			0
but the underlying implication is that we , the same humanity that used to roam the forest floor , now traverse concrete in this urban millennium			0
@entity27 is a @entity29 photographer based in @entity93			1
