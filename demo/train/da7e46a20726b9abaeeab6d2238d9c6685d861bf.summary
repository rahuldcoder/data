-- @entity1 was so close to breaking new ground at the @entity3 on saturday			1
no golfer on the @entity5 had ever shot a 59 , and there the @entity6 was on the 18th and last hole , needing a birdie to achieve the magical round			1
but @entity1 could n't convert a roughly 15 - foot chip and had to settle for a 60 , instead becoming the 18th man on the @entity5 to card that score			2

" it pitched just short of the hole			0
" " when i birdied the 13th , i said to @entity24 then , ' a few more and we could be part of history			0
' i was definitely nervous but thinking about it from the tournament point of view the leaders are going to be a minimum of 16 , 17 maybe 18 under going into tomorrow so that kept me going			0
" @entity1 only made the halfway cut by a shot but now trails leader @entity43 by merely two shots in a four - way tie for second			2
