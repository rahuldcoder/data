climate change talks of the year , @entity2 , get underway in @entity5 , the capital of @entity6 , this week , it will be the first time that the meeting has been hosted by a @entity9 country			1
as such , the talks provide the perfect opportunity for the countries in the region to prove that they have started to take climate change seriously			1
the best way to start proving that is to first pledge targets to reduce their carbon emissions			2
the @entity9 has been through a lot of change lately , but the region is often eerily quiet on climate change , not to mention that some countries of the region have been considered " obstructionist " in the process			1
this has been making a lot of countries coming to the negotiations very nervous			2
the @entity4 climate summit offers the opportunity for the " obstructionist " reputation to change , if the @entity33 communities play it right			2
putting forward pledges to the international community is one step that countries of the region can take in the right direction , but also regional civil society should start a strong @entity33 climate movement			1
read : greenhouse gases reach record highs this has already started , and one only needs to look at the launch of the @entity45 in a dozen countries earlier this month to see that the region 's young citizens , who were so instrumental in the @entity49 , are calling for their leaders to step up when it comes to the biggest environmental problem facing the @entity9 and @entity53			1
of course , @entity2 is not only about what the @entity33 world will do , but about what the rest of the world will do			2
@entity2 is a key transition conference , where old negotiations tracks need to be finalized , and new ones started			1
one key tough issue that parties need to crack is when global carbon emissions need to peak and start declining rapidly			2
according to science , emissions should peak by 2015 , if , we want to have a chance of keeping global warming within two degrees @entity71			0
while a two degrees temperature rise is not without risks -- as this year 's already worsening weather events such as @entity76 and the droughts in @entity78 and the @entity79 have shown -- it is a target which can be realistically achieved by our leaders			0
agreeing to this peak will also mean that countries which have been big polluters historically , like the @entity79 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 , will have to increase their commitments on carbon emission reductions			0
the @entity90 is currently our only binding climate deal and it is up for renewal here at @entity5			1
this should happen only after closing all the gaps that make this protocol weaker			0
read : chasing down the world 's vanishing glaciers while all this might seem difficult to achieve , failing to make progress at @entity5 would constitute a huge cost to society			0
a peer reviewed report , called " beyond dangerous climate change : emission scenarios for a new world , " written by @entity113 and @entity114 in 2011 , pointed out that there is a widespread understanding among scientists that an increase of four degrees @entity71 in global temperatures is incompatible with an organized global community			0
this means that if we do n't start reducing our greenhouse gas emissions urgently , it could lead to the collapse of human civilization			0
our current emission patterns are leading us to a 2.5 to five degrees increase before the end of this century			0
so far the world has only warmed 0.8 degrees @entity71 , and we are already witnessing severe weather phenomena			0
with the latest estimates saying @entity76 killed over 100 people and will end up costing $ 50 billion in the @entity79 alone , it makes sense on economic and humanitarian fronts to fund stringent responses to climate change			0
nevertheless , there is real hope building around the potential of the @entity5 meeting			0
compared to last year 's negotiations , the political climate change leadership in @entity139 and the @entity79 -- both major emitters with big pull at these talks -- is now certain			1
newly reelected president @entity143 called for climate action in his victory speech and @entity139 's new leader @entity146 called for a " better environment " in his acceptance			1
civil society is expecting these leaders to stand up where it matters -- inside the negotiating rooms of the @entity4 climate talks and push toward a fair , ambitious and binding deal that will preserve the future of the planet for generations to come			1
the views expressed in this article are solely those of @entity160 .			2

youth activists instrumental in @entity49 now calling for strong lead on climate from @entity9 leaders
civil society expect political leadership to stand up to push for a fair , ambitious and binding climate deal , @entity160 says
