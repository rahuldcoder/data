the @entity16 passengers , each 29 , heard searchers calling out on the @entity14 , @entity1 's @entity12 news agency reported early sunday			1
they were located in a cabin and taken ashore			2
@entity18 showed them being taken to a waiting ambulance			2
the captain of the ill - fated vessel , which turned over on its side after the grounding , was arrested late saturday and was being investigated for abandoning ship and manslaughter , a local prosecutor said			1
with perhaps up to 50 people unaccounted for , divers suspended their efforts at dark , with plans to resume the search in the azure waters off the island of @entity35 at dawn sunday			1
accounts of the chaos from many of the 3,200 passengers were reminiscent of a maritime disaster 100 years ago this april -- the loss of the @entity43			1
" for me , the worst part of the whole ordeal " was when a lifeboat crew member told those boarding that it was " women and children first , " said passenger @entity50 of @entity51			0
" all these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated , " @entity50 told @entity2			0
some passengers fell into the chilly waters during the rescue , @entity12 reported			1
questions abounded : why was the colossal ship so close to the shore ? how fast was it moving ? how well did the crew respond ? according to many passengers , the evacuation was disorganized and no one seemed in charge			1
" every crew member who walked past shouted instructions , but the instructions contradicted each other , " @entity50 said			0
@entity14 's captain , @entity71 , was interviewed earlier saturday about what happened when the ship struck rocks in shallow water off @entity1 's western coast friday evening , said officer @entity77 of the @entity78 of @entity79			1
local fishermen say the island coast of @entity35 is known for its rocky sea floor			0
@entity83 said " that rock was not indicated on the chart , " according to @entity12			0
" me and the crew , we were the last to abandon ship , " he said			1
the ship was 2.5 miles off route when it struck the rocky sandbar			1
" there are rocks , they are on the maps , " said capt. @entity92 of the @entity9 @entity93			0
" what we know is the ship went really close to these rocks			1
... we do n't yet know why			0
" the ship began taking on water friday evening and the crew kept going because they believed the vessel could normally keep sailing , @entity92 said			1
realizing there was a significant safety problem , the commander steered the @entity14 closer toward port			0
authorities also were looking at why the ship did n't hail a mayday during the accident			1
" at the moment we ca n't exclude that the ship had some kind of technical problem , and for this reason moved towards the coast in order to save the passengers , the crew and the ship			1
but they did n't send a mayday			0
the ship got in contact with us once the evacuation procedures were already ongoing , " @entity77 said prior to the announcement of the captain 's arrest			1
@entity132 , a spokesman with the local civil protection agency , said 43 to 51 people were missing , though authorities are reviewing passenger lists to confirm the exact figure			1
" these people could be still on the island of @entity35 , in private houses or in hospitals , " @entity132 said			1
two @entity145 tourists and a crew member from @entity147 were killed , @entity143 authorities in @entity79 said			0
one of the victims was a 65 - year - old woman who died of a heart attack , according to authorities			0
@entity151 , a maritime employees trade union , called the accident a " wake - up call " to regulators			0
" @entity151 is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships -- with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade , " said @entity151 general secretary @entity151 in a statement			0
" many ships are now effectively small towns at sea , and the sheer number of people onboard raises serious questions about evacuation			1
" @entity168 , president of @entity170 - based @entity169 , expressed " deep sorrow for this terrible tragedy , " but said the cruise line was unable to answer all the questions that authorities are now investigating			0
the vessel , plying the waters from @entity177 to @entity178 , @entity1 , struck a submerged rock , @entity168 said in a statement before the announcement of the captain 's arrest			1
" @entity71 , who was on the bridge at the time , immediately understood the severity of the situation and performed a maneuver intended to protect both guests and crew , and initiated security procedures to prepare for an eventual ship evacuation , " he continued			1
" unfortunately , that operation was complicated by a sudden tilting of the ship that made disembarkation difficult , " @entity168 said			1
@entity196 , a member of the cruise ship staff , said the captain told passengers there was an " electrical problem			1
" @entity14 was carrying about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members when it ran aground			1
" i 'm not surprised that it ( the ship ) would wind up tipping like this , " said @entity204 , professor of naval architecture at the @entity205 on @entity206 , @entity207			2
" something had to go wrong with either the controls or the navigation to get it to this condition			0
" @entity216 , adjunct professor of naval architecture at the @entity218 and @entity219 at the @entity220 , said , " from the size of the gash , she must have been steaming at a pretty good pace			0
" fear and panic aboard crippled ship panic spread as people scrambled to find lifeboats in the dark as the ship quickly leaned to one side late friday			1
access to some lifeboats was hampered by the ship 's tilt into the water			2
with the ship 's staircases flooded , @entity50 and others made rope ladders to climb from the outer fourth deck to the third			2
they were eventually rescued more than three hours later by a lifeboat that had returned from dropping passengers ashore			1
at least three lifeboats , each with a capacity of more than 100 people , apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error , @entity50 said			2
" the people manning these boats were just cooks and shopkeepers , " @entity50 said			2
@entity256 , chief of the @entity258 's @entity257 , said , " when it comes to cruise ships , in the event of emergency , cabin stewards or others would have safety roles , " he said			0
the @entity93 inspects foreign - flagged cruise ships in @entity268 waters twice a year , studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon - ship drills , @entity256 said			1
many passengers asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck around dinner time , only hours into their journey			2
the timing of the safety briefings and muster drills depend on the length of the cruise , @entity256 told @entity2			0
many of those rescued in the early hours were taken to small churches and other buildings around the island for shelter			2
some were still wearing the pajamas and slippers they had on as the ship went down			2
@entity293 , a passenger from @entity294 , told @entity2 there was no initial announcement after the vessel began its tilt			0
others reported being unable to clearly hear instructions			0
once ashore , no one from the crew assisted them , @entity293 said			0
rather , it was up to islanders			0
" there did n't seem to be anybody in charge , " she said			0
@entity169 , owned by parent company @entity310 , said it was focusing on the final stages of the emergency operation and helping passengers and crew return home			2
