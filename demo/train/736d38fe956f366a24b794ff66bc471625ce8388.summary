-- @entity2 host city @entity1 has concocted a new way to deal with the madness that comes with managing the world 's biggest annual sporting event			2
the solution ? the @entity9 's first - ever social media command center			1
a team of strategists , analysts and techies will monitor the digital fan conversation via @entity15 , @entity16 and other platforms from a 2,800 - square - foot space downtown			1
the station was set to open on monday and run through @entity2 on february 5			1
the team will tweet directions to fans in search of parking , direct visitors to @entity1 's best attractions , and stand by to provide information in case of a disaster			0
" social media is just how people interact now , " said @entity30 , ceo of @entity31 , the digital marketing agency that the @entity9 's host committee tapped to manage the communications hub			1
" we felt it was critical to have some horsepower behind that aspect of the @entity9 here , versus what you might have seen from other @entity9			0
" some 150,000 people are expected to flood into downtown @entity1 -- where the game will be played at @entity45 -- over @entity9 weekend			0
advanced search tools and analytics will help @entity30 and his team identify fans in need of help by indexing key words and phrases			0
for example , a fan wo n't need to tweet , " where can i find parking ? " to get help ; @entity60 operatives will be able to pick up on a general phrase such as " parking sucks " to offer assistance			2
but it wo n't be a simple operation			0
the command center will utilize more than a mile of @entity68 cable and more than 150 square feet of networked screen space			1
more than 20 people will man the center for 15 hours per day			0
researchers from nearby @entity74 's @entity73 will conduct a study of the command center , analyzing its strengths and weaknesses			1
@entity79 , director of the center 's @entity80 , wrote in an email that the command center is an example of the " the ubiquity of social media and the absolute necessity for companies , organizations and communities to use these tools to improve their relations with their customer , audiences and citizens			1
" both @entity79 and @entity30 said they would not be surprised if the @entity9 's first designated social - media warroom sets a precedent for other major events			2
" we 're kind of breaking new ground here so we do n't know the exact numbers yet of what we 'll be dealing with , but we should be able to provide that after the game to other cities that have to deal with these types of issues , " @entity30 said			0
" i think a lot of brands will start to see a need for something like this			0

social media center opened monday and will run through @entity2
techies will monitor the digital fan conversation via @entity15 , @entity16 and other platforms
the command center will utilize more than a mile of @entity68 cable
