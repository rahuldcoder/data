-- who is @entity2 ? he 's a private citizen , a conservative lobbyist , the author of the @entity3 and president of @entity5			1
his idea of tax reform is no more tax increases ever again			1
and no closed loopholes unless matched by cuts in government spending			0
in the 113th @entity14 , the one just elected that will begin in january , 219 of 234 @entity12 in the @entity13 signed his tax pledge ; in the @entity18 , nine of 41 @entity12 senators signed it			1
by contrast , before the 112th @entity14 , which is still in session , 248 representatives and 41 senators signed it			0
the drop in support has brought the pledge into the media limelight			0
@entity2 says the pledge was made to the @entity30 people			1
but @entity2 is the sole enforcer of the pledge , which he keeps in a fireproof safe in his office			1
no one has dared to challenge his self - appointed role as enforcer on behalf of @entity30 voters			0
opinion : who 's afraid of @entity2 ? four @entity12 senators , among them @entity44 's @entity43 , as well as rep. @entity45 , said they would willingly ditch their pledge , in @entity43 's words , " for the good of the country			1
" in an equally significant move , @entity51 rep. @entity50 of the @entity53 team told house speaker @entity55 that he thought the @entity12 should join president @entity56 and immediately pass a tax extension for 98 % of @entity30 who earn under $ 250,000			2
these declarations from @entity12 leaders are like political dynamite			1
and like well - placed dynamite , they might begin to break the logjam preventing effective leadership and legislation in @entity14			0
@entity2 , of course , does n't think so			2
his tax pledge has bound most elected republicans to him for 25 years			1
when @entity45 said that he felt his pledge was only for one @entity14 , @entity2 compared the pledge to marriage vows , hinting @entity45 's wife should be worried			1
( i could n't find " till death do us part " in the pledge			0
but then , i 'm not a @entity12 )			2
your money : is @entity2 's power overrated ? @entity45 replied that @entity2 was " being a lowlife , " words that caused almost an audible gasp among @entity12			1
you see , @entity2 's pledge is n't about money ; it 's about loyalty			1
next to @entity88 's pledge to defeat @entity56 in 2012 , @entity2 is the man most responsible for @entity12 lockstep voting and gridlock in @entity91			1
that top republicans are willing to openly defy @entity2 's pledge and that any are willing to buck @entity93 and @entity55 are seminal events in recent @entity30 history			1
it means some @entity12 office holders are actually listening to what the voters said in the 2012 elections : help the middle class , work together , stop the finger - pointing			2
but @entity93 and his collaborators are proceeding as if the 2012 election never happened			0
he and other @entity12 " leaders " apparently intend to extend the @entity12 campaign , disregarding the election and the people 's mandate			1
they intend to push the @entity12 agenda that voters overwhelmingly rejected at the voting booth and in post-election polls			2
@entity55 claims that @entity14 received its own mandate			0
but @entity12 lost seats in the @entity13 and the @entity18 that they had expected to win			2
besides , as @entity121 used to say , " the president is the only elected official who represents all the people			0
" read more : no - tax pledge has survived challenges before @entity124 , president @entity125 's chief of staff , in writing about the fiscal cliff , said , " @entity56 did n't win just because of demographics : he won on the economy			1
... the electorate understood that a vote for @entity56 was a vote for policies that would help the middle class and the working poor			0
" furthermore , " the public has joined the majority of leading economists in recognizing that a strong middle class , not ever more generous benefits for the wealthy , as the true engine of economic growth			0
" the @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 of the @entity12 get it			2
there are n't enough cuts to offset $ 1 trillion in lost taxes from the excessive tax breaks the wealthy were given			0
the alternative is to harm our national security , weaken our defenses and cause some @entity30 to literally go without food			0
the @entity12 budget that passed the @entity13 , but not the @entity18 , before the election would cut food stamps as excess spending for unemployed parents			2
extending the lesser tax breaks for 98 % of all @entity30 is , indeed , a first order of business			0
or as @entity50 said , " it 's the right thing to do			0
" there is money for these things			0
first , though , @entity12 must break @entity2 's insane hold on their party			1
more republicans must put their country before someone else 's agenda , and their @entity171 before " @entity172 " to @entity2			1
it 's merely a handful right now , but it looks as if the 75 % of voters who approved of @entity56 's economic approach in exit polls to help the middle class and working poor are getting a voice in @entity14			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			0

@entity2 's tax pledge calls for no more tax increases ever
@entity182 : it 's *seismic* that some @entity12 leaders are willing to defy his pledge
she says @entity2 's tax pledge has bound most elected republicans to him for 25 years
@entity182 : @entity2 is the man most responsible for @entity12 gridlock in @entity91
