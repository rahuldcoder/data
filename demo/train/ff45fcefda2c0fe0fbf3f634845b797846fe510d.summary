@entity0 -- engaging a rarely used power , @entity3 chairman @entity2 announced his committee will vote next thursday on whether to hold former @entity7 official @entity6 in contempt of @entity9 for refusing to testify about the agency 's targeting of conservative organizations			1
" documents and testimony point to @entity6 as a senior @entity7 official responsible for conduct that deprived @entity20 of their rights to free speech and equal protection under the law , " wrote the @entity14 @entity13 in a statement released thursday			1
@entity6 ran the @entity7 division that determined tax - exempt status for nonprofit organizations			1
an @entity7 inspector general 's report concluded that her division used " inappropriate " search terms to flag some conservative applications , including " @entity33 " and " patriot			1
" @entity35 have pointed out that some liberal terms , such as " progressive , " were also on the list			0
the contempt vote caps a year of dramatic back - and - forth in @entity3 @entity13 ' investigation into the targeting			1
@entity13 leaders , including @entity2 , have focused on whether higher - ranking officials , including any at the @entity3 , played a role blocking conservative organizations ' applications			1
thus far , no evidence has shown that the effort to flag political groups went beyond @entity6 and her employees			1
@entity2 has said that @entity6 's testimony could prove critical			2
but the former @entity7 official has repeatedly refused to answer the committee 's questions , invoking her @entity54 right against self - incrimination			1
that normally might protect her from contempt of @entity9 charges			0
but @entity13 charge that @entity6 waived her constitutional right by first reading a statement to the committee asserting her innocence			2
" i believe @entity6 waived her @entity54 privilege , " @entity2 said in a hearing last june			1
" she did so when she chose to make a voluntary opening statement			0
" @entity13 argue and cite some case law showing that an individual can not apply the @entity54 in some instances and not others			2
but the case law on the @entity54 is nuanced , and @entity6 's attorney and @entity3 @entity35 have fervently disagreed with @entity13 ' conclusion			1
they insist she is protected by the @entity54			2
the debate could spark a potential legal battle			0
overall , democrats call the investigation a witch hunt and the contempt vote a publicity move			2
" this contempt vote appears geared more toward generating more press for ( @entity2 ) , rather than working responsibly with committee members to seek facts , " said @entity81 , who is the spokesman for the top @entity82 on the @entity83 , @entity84 of @entity85			2
@entity6 's attorney 's office said it had no comment yet on the upcoming committee vote			1
the contempt resolution is expected to pass the @entity13 - led @entity83 thursday morning			2
the @entity3 is in recess the following week , meaning the soonest a contempt vote could hit the @entity3 floor is the week of april 24			0
even without the @entity54 issue , it 's not clear how far the case will go			0
after a @entity3 vote to find @entity6 in contempt , the process would leave @entity13 ' hands and go to the @entity20 attorney for @entity0 , who would be directed to call a grand jury			1
that is where the last contempt of @entity9 charge ended			0
in 2012 , the @entity13 @entity112 voted to hold attorney general @entity113 in contempt of @entity9 for refusing to hand over documents related to the " @entity117 " gun controversy			0
the @entity3 asserted executive privilege at that time , and the @entity119 announced it would not prosecute			0
the @entity121 administration has not claimed executive privilege in @entity6 's case , but the @entity119 still retains the ability to determine whether her actions deserve prosecution			0
the penalty for contempt of @entity9 is up to a year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine			0
since 1980 , nine individuals have been held in contempt by the @entity112			0
@entity1 senior producer @entity132 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity135 will vote on holding an @entity137 official in contempt
