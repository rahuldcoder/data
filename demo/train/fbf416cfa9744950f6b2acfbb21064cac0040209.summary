" i do n't feel like the scores are actually reflecting how i 'm hitting the ball , " the @entity18 told reporters			2
" i was able to string nine good holes together yesterday			0
" i just need to keep working on it and try and string 18 good holes together and then try and string two days together and obviously three days and ultimately four			0

" he 's obviously frustrated -- this game does that to you , " the @entity58 said			0
" he 's not far away			0
he made a couple of careless errors , but i 'm sure once he posts one solid run of maybe a couple of rounds or a tournament this will be a blur and he 'll forget about it quickly			2
