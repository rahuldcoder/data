-- the plight of a 10 - year - old @entity3 girl who could die within weeks without a lung transplant has sparked a fight for new rules governing organ donations			1
tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on @entity11 , and a congressman has called on the @entity14 administration to take quick action			2
@entity16 -- whose story @entity0 chronicled -- needs new lungs			1
she 's been in a @entity20 hospital for months due to the cystic fibrosis that she 's had since birth			2
she 's at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her region			1
she 's been waiting for 18 months			2
but doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often			1
that 's where the rules becomes a problem			2
kids under age 12 are n't prioritized for adult organs			1
so @entity16 could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down			1
@entity16 's mother , @entity46 , told @entity0 she was " shocked " when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago			1
the @entity48 ( @entity48 ) manages the nation 's transplant system under contract with the @entity52			2
the network , established by @entity54 , is officially called the @entity48 ( @entity48 )			2
lawmaker assails ' tragic unfairness ' rep. @entity57 , a @entity58 who represents @entity16 's district , sent a letter tuesday to secretary of health and human services @entity61 , calling on her to convene a meeting of the network 's leadership immediately " to address this tragic unfairness and act to give @entity16 a chance at life and an adult lung from the next available donor			1
@entity16 's young life literally hangs in the balance			1
" it 's a message echoed on the @entity11 petition			2
" this policy needs to change , " it reads			0
" the @entity76 , a national group of transplant physicians and surgeons , can make an exceptional ruling for @entity16			1
and they can recommend new policies			0
" people posted heartfelt messages along with their signatures			0
" because my daughter had ( cystic fibrosis ) and a double lung transplant			0
give this little girl the life she is entitled to ! " wrote @entity88			0
" she has just as much right to have a transplant as any adult			2
she could have her whole life if given that chance and for the parents to enjoy what some waiting adults have already experienced , " wrote @entity94			0
organ network : breaking the rules could hurt another patient @entity48 issued a statement noting that there is a separate policy for children because the " biological needs and circumstances of candidates younger than age 12 are different from either adolescent or adult candidates			1
one key difference is the size and lung capacity of donors and patients among these age ranges			1
" kids younger than age 12 are prioritized for donations from other kids of similar age and size within a 1,000 - mile radius			1
policies allow " status adjustments for specifically defined groups of candidates with unique medical circumstances not addressed by the overall policy , " the statement says			0
but , it adds , a " request to adjust the status of a patient under age 12 so that they may be included in the allocation sequence for adolescents and adults is not within the scope of the existing lung allocation policy			0
@entity48 can not create a policy exemption on behalf of an individual patient , since giving an advantage to one patient may unduly disadvantage others			0
" the network routinely reviews policies and considers " public input as well as medical data and experience , " the statement said			0
dr. @entity153 , a board member at @entity48 , helped develop the current policies			0
" there is no perfect system , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's the best we can do right now			0
" @entity153 said @entity16 's story " tugs at his heart " but that if he changed the system for @entity16 's advantage , " there 's another patient , very likely an adolescent , who gets a disadvantage			1
" " we 've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible			0
" @entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , and @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

10 - year - old @entity16 could die within weeks if she does n't get new lungs
