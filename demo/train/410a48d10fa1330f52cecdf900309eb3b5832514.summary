@entity0 -- the @entity2 made it harder wednesday for foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity to press their legal claims against corporations and others in @entity12 federal courts			1
the outcome could have significant global impact from a moral , political and financial perspective			0
at issue is the scope of a federal law that is increasingly being used in an effort to hold those accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas			1
a dozen @entity23 political activists now living under asylum in the @entity12 say foreign oil companies were complicit in violence at the hands of their former country 's military			1
their decade - old civil damages lawsuits have been blocked from going to trial in @entity12 courts			1
chief justice @entity33 , writing for the unanimous court , said acts committed on foreign soil by foreign entities against foreign citizens typically can not be resolved in @entity12 courts			1
" on these facts , all the relevant conduct took place outside the @entity12 , " he said			2
" corporations are often present in many countries , and it would reach too far to say that mere corporate presence suffices " to press these kinds of legal claims			0
the @entity49 administration is siding partly with the foreign businesses			0
the justices first heard the case in february 2012 , trying to sort out whether individuals alone -- or political groups and corporations also -- are covered by broad civil immunity for alleged international law abuses			2
then the court then took on another more fundamental question : whether the 1789 federal law can be applied to any conduct committed entirely outside the @entity12			1
@entity33 , in his opinion , noted a ruling for the foreign plaintiffs could affect @entity12 living , working or traveling overseas			1
" accepting petitioners ' view would imply that other nations , also applying the law of nations , could hale our citizens into their courts for alleged violations of the law of nations occurring in the @entity12 , or anywhere else in the world , " @entity33 said			1
" the presumption against extraterritoriality guards against our courts triggering such serious foreign policy consequences , and instead defers such decisions , quite appropriately , to the political branches			0
" the human rights appeal was filed on behalf of residents of the oil - abundant @entity89 area of the @entity91			1
two decades ago , they protested the longstanding environmental harm that @entity94 and other energy companies caused by extracting petroleum			2
they and their families say the @entity23 government brutally suppressed them , " aided and abetted " by private corporations doing business there			2
the @entity89 9 , as the key leaders became known , were allegedly detained , tortured and tried by a special @entity23 military tribunal , in violation of international human rights treaties			1
the @entity23 government 's 1993 - 1995 crackdown sparked global outrage after author @entity109 and eight other activists were convicted , then hanged			2
among those bringing suit is his nephew , @entity113 , who escaped the oppression and now lives in @entity115 as a political refugee			0
he described being a student activist beaten by soldiers for hours in front of a crowd of onlookers , then detained and tortured for days			0
he says that @entity94 , based in the @entity122 and @entity123 , conspired with the government to keep its business operations going in the face of protests and should be held accountable for ignoring or encouraging a pattern of killings , rapes , beatings and property destruction			2
he said the @entity12 is only place to obtain justice			2
" @entity23 's dictatorship has grown rich from its oil , " @entity135 told @entity1			2
" it is important those ( oil ) companies be held responsible , because we can not bring any legal action in courts in @entity23			1
" the @entity12 law in question is the @entity146 , which gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations			1
it was largely ignored for decades but has become an important legal vehicle for those bringing human rights claims			1
similar lawsuits involve @entity156 and @entity158 energy operations in @entity159 ; @entity161 fruit farms in @entity162 ; and businesses that operated years ago in the now - outlawed apartheid system in @entity165			0
" @entity94 remains firmly committed to supporting fundamental human rights in line with the legitimate role of business and i want to make clear that we deny , in the strongest possible terms , the allegations made by the plaintiffs in this tragic case , " said @entity166 , @entity94 's legal director , in response to the ruling			1
" today 's decision does n't weaken the human rights of people around the world ; it makes it clear that the @entity146 does not provide a means for claims to be brought in the @entity12 which have nothing to do with the @entity12 " but a range of human rights groups said they were " deeply disappointed			1
" " today 's decision moves one step closer to shutting the court room doors to victims of war crimes and torture , " said the @entity190 - based @entity189			0
however , the organization said , " this ruling is not a grant of immunity from liability			0
" the high court in 2004 endorsed the use of the statute in question , but only in limited circumstances			0
wednesday 's decision reinforced that approach			0
but the four more liberal justices , while agreeing with the court 's conclusion , differed on the reasoning behind it			0
justice @entity213 suggested that the @entity146 should continue to have some strong enforcement application			0
" international norms have long included a duty not to permit a nation to become a safe harbor for pirates ( or their equivalent ) , " he said , citing past @entity2 cases			2
" this approach would avoid placing the statute 's jurisdictional scope at odds with its substantive objectives , holding out ' the word of promise ' of compensation for victims of the torturer			0
" the civil lawsuits in the international law context have been compared to a separate , high - profile domestic political dispute			0
the high court in 2010 concluded that corporations -- businesses , unions and issue advocacy groups -- enjoy the same free speech rights as individuals when it comes to independent election spending			0
now the issue in part was whether corporations and political entities should be treated the same as individual offenders when it comes to enforcing international human rights			1
the current case is @entity255 ( 10 - 1491 ) .			0

lawsuits *accused* foreign oil companies of being complicit in violence against @entity23
in a unanimous ruling , the @entity12 @entity2 says a federal law does n't apply in this case
chief justice : ruling for plaintiffs could affect @entity12 living , working or traveling overseas
new : @entity94 says ruling does n't weaken human rights but rights advocates disappointed
