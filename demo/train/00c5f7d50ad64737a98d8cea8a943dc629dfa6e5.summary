when it comes to the gender pay gap , the cynics have used smoke and mirrors to deny the truth while @entity6 continues to come up short on critical legislation			1
so now , the president is not waiting another minute to make real progress			2
on tuesday , president @entity11 continued his " year of action " by signing two new executive orders to strengthen enforcement of equal pay laws where @entity6 has so far failed to act			1
he also challenged the @entity16 to " start making this right " by passing the @entity18 when it comes up for a vote on wednesday			1
the @entity16 has tried twice , but the act was blocked by a handful of stubborn @entity23			0
but even before the ink was dry on his executive orders , wage - gap deniers were trotting out the same old tired arguments we 've heard for years			1
rationalizing or outright denying that pay inequity exists , and dismissing the equal pay push as a political ploy designed to distract from other , " real " issues			0
yet for millions of women struggling on the brink of poverty , the wage gap is all too real			1
despite increasing education and greater professional success , women in the aggregate still make less than men : on average , 77 cents on the dollar , and even less if you are black or @entity46			0
this persistent pay gap has real implications for women and their families , especially when 40 % of our nation 's households with children rely on women as a primary or sole source of income			2
that 23 - cent disparity means a yearly wage gap for women of more than $ 11,000			1
and what does that translate into ? on average , working women in the @entity64 can afford 91 fewer weeks of food for their families , 13 fewer months of rent , and more than 3,000 fewer gallons of gas per year as compared to men			0
it 's not surprising then that polls rank equal pay for equal work as a top issue for women across the country			0
more people prefer a male boss , but gender gap is narrowing but like a bad magician , the naysayers are trying to use smoke and mirrors to fool us into believing the problem is just an illusion			2
they say the wage gap is a myth , based on anecdotes , not data			1
they say there 's no need for new laws , because it 's already illegal to discriminate			0
any differences that remain , they say , can be explained away by personal choices			0
while it 's true the wage gap is due to a combination of factors , study after study has shown the wage gap — as much as 40 % of it — holds true even when we control for factors such as education level , profession or position			1
it can not be fully explained by personal choices , and can be attributed in some measure to overt or unintentional gender - based discrimination			2
the gap manifests out of the gate and only widens over time			2
a 2012 report from the @entity118 , " graduating to a @entity125 , " made an " apples - to - apples " comparison of college - educated women and men working full time one year out of school			2
after controlling for college major , occupation , hours worked per week , economic sector , and other factors , women still made 7 % less than what their male counterparts made			0
and in an earlier report , the association found that 10 years after graduation , the unexplained pay gap widened to 12 %			0
indeed , women 's wages are lower in nearly all occupations -- doctors , lawyers , even low - wage workers			1
and this is true regardless of whether the job is one performed predominantly by men , predominantly women , or an even mix of both			0
what millennial women want now that 's why we still need @entity6 to act , to pass the @entity18 to ensure that all employers are held to the standards embodied in tuesday 's executive actions			1
this week @entity6 has an opportunity to go from its standing ovation for equal pay at the @entity158 to really standing up for women			1
when the rubber meets the road , let 's hope we move beyond the rhetoric to acting on real solutions			0
do n't make the president take out his pen again , unless it is to sign the new law			1
join us on @entity169 / @entity168 .			0

@entity171 : president @entity11 had no option but to sign orders on @entity175
@entity6 , she says , now must pass the @entity18
wage - gap deniers , she says , are trotting out the same old tired arguments
