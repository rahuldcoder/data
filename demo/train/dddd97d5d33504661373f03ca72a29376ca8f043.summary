-- heavyweight @entity1 faces being sanctioned by the @entity2 , after being called to a hearing next month following his brawl with fellow - @entity6 @entity5 at a press conference on saturday			1
despite @entity1 issuing an apology for the fracas , which occured after his points defeat to @entity12 champion @entity11 in @entity13 , the @entity2 has released a statement saying that a hearing has been arranged for march 14			1
board secretary @entity16 said : " @entity1 has been called to appear before the stewards of the @entity2 on wednesday , 14th march under @entity18 ( misconduct ) , with regard to his behavior prior , during and after his contest for the @entity12 heavyweight championship against @entity11 on saturday , 18th february in @entity13			1
" @entity5 -- who retired from boxing following his defeat to @entity11 's younger brother @entity26 last year and is therefore not under the jurisdiction of the @entity2 -- had appeared at the press conference to take issue with @entity11 's management , who he claims have reneged on a deal to fight him later this year			1
but he soon became embroiled in a shouting match with @entity1 , which resulted in the 28 - year - old leaving his seat on the stage to confront @entity5 -- resulting in an unseemly brawl which saw @entity5 's manager @entity39 receive a gash to his forehead			1
during the incident , @entity1 threatened to " shoot " @entity5 a number of times and the @entity46 - born boxer has now " wholeheartedly apologized " for his " inexcusable " actions			1
" i feel i must wholeheartedly apologize for my part in the regrettable scenes both before and after what was to be the biggest night of my career , " @entity1 said in a statement			2
" whilst my behavior was inexcusable , there were many things that went on behind the scenes that ultimately caused my frustrations to boil over , however this is of course no excuse			0
" he added : " i can not go into the specific details at the moment as quite rightly the @entity2 will be investigating this matter			0
" the bottom line is i have let my family , my team and , worst of all , the sport i love down			0
i acknowledge that my actions were totally unprofessional , with or without provocation			0
" i have a duty as a professional boxer to conduct myself properly at all times , especially with boxing being a sport of controlled aggression			0
i have let lots of people down on saturday night , including myself , and for that i am truly sorry			0
" @entity5 , who relinquished his boxing license in october when he officially retired , also issued a statement , although he stopped short of apologizing and pinned the blame for the fracas squarely on @entity1 's shoulders			1
he said : " i realise i am no angel -- and do n't mind a bit of professional trash - talk to help raise boxing 's profile -- but , during my 21 years in the sport , i have never been involved in , or even witnessed , such a serious fracas			0
" i shall happily assist the boxing authorities with any investigation they wish to launch and , ultimately , hope that all lessons learned from this will be implemented			0
" the brawl was the final act of a controversial weekend for @entity1 , who received widespread criticism for slapping @entity11 during the pre-fight weight - in			1
and @entity5 continued his statement by adding : " moments before declaring he wanted to go face - to - face with me , @entity1 assured the gathered media that he would give me ' two slaps '			2
" his weekend had already been shrouded in controversy but , despite this , @entity1 climbed down from the top table , removed his robe and then walked towards me , entourage in tow , in an aggressive manner			2
" i held my ground , but , unfortunately , he caused a serious disturbance to occur , something which threatened to damage the reputation of the sport we both love			0
" the incident , during which @entity1 claimed @entity5 hit him over the head with a bottle , is still being investigated by @entity13 police , although police spokesman @entity120 said : " until we speak to @entity5 , nothing more can happen			1
" we need both sides			0
we have heard from @entity1 and now we wait to hear from @entity5			2
