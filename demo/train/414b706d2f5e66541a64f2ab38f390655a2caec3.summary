-- dear mr. principal , my son , @entity1 , started seventh grade today			1
he 's the one who often sits in his guidance counselor 's office because he 's too nervous to go to class			1
remember , the kid who got two days of suspension because he broke your " personal space " rule by touching another boy 's necklace he thought was cool ? i want a fresh start this year , so it 's time you heard who @entity1 is			1
his trouble with school started early			1
he cried every day in kindergarten until nearly @entity21			2
his teacher , on her last year after 36 with the district , put him at a desk alone , facing the corner			2
to keep us from figuring this out , she moved his desk back on open school night and parent - teacher conferences ( during which she lamented his high - energy and " incorrigible " attitude )			1
we found out in may , when my husband walked into the room unexpectedly with a forgotten snack			2
parenting : 8 times your doctor wants you to call the diagnosis of @entity40 came as third grade started			1
we gave him the meds , which his teacher appreciated			0
still , homework was a battle			0
the teacher sent us notes , full of obvious tips she must have thought we were too incompetent to have considered , like setting up a homework spot and providing a snack			0
these rubber - stamp homework success tips did nothing to address the elephant in the room : the fact that a kid who reads at a level several grades below the one he 's in is not going to be able to do , say , the social studies homework which involves reading a textbook			1
soon the medication 's effects wore off			1
and the thing was , it was too late for any pill to make him love to learn anyway			0
the next three years proceeded in the same way : we spent the first half of the year being scared by threats of his being left back , predictions of his never graduating high school if he did n't read more , even becoming a " troubled teen			1
" then with spring came the state tests , which he passed , literally , by a point or two			1
i was mystified , considering that he flunked nearly every in - class test			0
i asked how this was possible , and never got a straight answer			0
we pleaded for him to go to summer school , and the answer was always " he 's fine ! summer school is only for the kids who do n't pass the tests			1
" parenting : top @entity93 apps for kids so we paid a tutor each summer			1
we knew she could n't work a miracle , but her unspoken role was to praise his efforts , something few adults did			1
we gladly paid her for that			0
as his academic abilities floundered , though , his athletic abilities grew ; he was an all - star basketball player every year , @entity107 twice			0
at practices , the other moms would drop their sons off			0
i stayed for the hour and a half , all alone , watching			0
do you have kids , mr. principal ? for a couple of hours a week , he was n't a problem			2
basketball saved him ... and me			0
on july 4 , 2010 , we were watching fireworks when his head started twitching			0
then his arm started jerking			0
the tics got worse and as the first day of fifth grade approached , he started grunting , chirping , and meowing			2
the kids that year , having known him all through elementary school , were pretty tolerant			2
at the end of fifth grade , i was finally able to convince the special education committee that a child who has never been able to read a single grade - level summer reading book is not " fine			1
" he was put into an inclusion class as he moved into your school			2
parenting : 5 secrets for a longer life the kids in junior high , though , were n't as kind as the ones in elementary school			1
he was bullied on the bus , called a freak			0
with all due respect , your " zero tolerance anti-bullying policy " is crap			0
a kid got off the bus at @entity1 's stop , and then attempted to strangle him			1
he got two days suspension , after which he commenced taunting my son as if nothing had happened			2
ironically , that was the same punishment @entity1 got earlier in the year for admiring that shark tooth necklace a little too closely			1
and then , with your " classes come first " policy , @entity1 could n't play basketball anymore			1
as you know , no extracurricular activities if a kid is in danger of failing any subject			0
no exceptions , even for special - ed students			0
i lost my all - star point guard , and @entity1 lost the one thing that made him feel good about himself			1
maybe if he had been allowed some extracurriculars , he might have perceived school to be more fun , and tried a little harder			2
now you know the story of @entity180 on your special education roster : he looks like any other 12 - year old boy : gawky , a little bedraggled , yet usually smiling , with braces			0
but he had a rough start and never fully recovered			0
he often says " i 'm stupid , " or " everyone hates me , " and sometimes , " i do n't care anymore			2
" parenting : could you be pregnant ? in summer school last month , he got a 70			1
a pleasure to have in class , they said			0
he 's not the norm in your school , but he 's one of yours , still			1
please make room for him , and kids like him , in your policies and your attitude			2
and if he 's still in danger of failing something come october ... can you bend your rule for basketball ? if we work together , we can prove that elementary - school teacher who saw him as a future troubled teen wrong			1
