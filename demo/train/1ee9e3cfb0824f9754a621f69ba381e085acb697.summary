with the boom of @entity4 booking sites , the traditional travel agent was , we were told , an endangered species			1
@entity6 recently included travel agents in its roundup of " useless jobs			1
" for younger , independent , brand - disloyal , budget - conscious travelers used to the @entity11 and getting instant information , the idea of having somebody else book your trip while you wait is all wrong			0
to be sure , many agents are no longer with us			1
in the @entity19 there are about 13,000 travel retail locations , down from a peak of 34,000 in the mid- 1990s			1
but they also account for a third of the @entity19 travel market -- some $ 95 billion in 2011 , according to a recent study by @entity26 , a travel market research company			1
so what happened ? did the naysayers get it wrong ? agent evolution the reality is that the typical travel agency of 15 or so years ago , which focused on point - to - point trips , is largely dead			1
but as online bookings have grown , new breeds of agent have emerged that target luxury , business and niche travelers who value personal relationships and expertise over savings			1
" some industry watchers indicate a return to the traditional agent , " says @entity44 , principal analyst at @entity26			0
but they 're wrong , he adds			0
in the valley of the recession in 2009 , luxury and business travel took serious losses , especially compared to deeply discounted travel ; traditional agents were hardest hit , losing nearly a quarter of their revenues			1
but then they rebounded , and fast , and the areas with the sharpest declines were the same ones that rebounded fastest , led by corporate travel			1
that led to reports of booming business in this area , which is not inaccurate , but does n't tell the whole story , either			0
" we 've seen continual incremental shift to online channels			0
we see no migration back to travel agents			1
" but they still account for $ 95 billion in revenue , so who 's using them ? below are some areas where travel agents are still succeeding			1
corporate travel agencies in this area analyze a company 's travel patterns and suggest ways to save money , such as discounts through the managed travel provider			1
some are popular with executives , as they provide interfaces that limit the number of options available			0
many executives admit to not sticking to their company 's travel policies because they book whatever is most convenient , according to a report by @entity95			1
and the business traveler by day can become a diyer by night			0
" when it comes to business travel , most people do n't check online			1
they just want to book , " says @entity101 of @entity102 , a boutique agency in @entity103			1
" but when it comes to holiday travel , that has gone substantially online			2
when the same person is now paying from their own pocket , they care much more [ about price ]			0
" luxury the luxury market also works well under the agency model and has the benefit of being to some degree recession - and even internet - proof			1
" when you 've got people who are 50 - plus and have got money , the recession does n't change that , " says @entity118 , head of travel , hospitality and leisure at @entity122			2
@entity118 says that the luxury traveler " wants to talk to someone who has experience			0
that 's a sustainable model			2
" cruises cruise line and tour operator sales remain a lifeline for agents catering to the leisure sector , according to the @entity26 report			2
these income streams still pay agents ' commissions and agents still book these more often than individuals do			2
complicated and important trips travelers also seek agents for complex itineraries and once - in - a - lifetime trips , such as honeymoons			2
emerging markets although online bookings are growing rapidly in emerging markets , in northern @entity155 countries such as @entity156 and @entity157 , there 's still a substantial amount of offline booking , especially when people travel to countries where they do n't speak the language , says @entity118			2
in @entity167 , where large numbers of first - time travelers are heading overseas , it 's common to travel with an organized group			2
" it 's very different than the mature @entity19 market , where people are more comfortable traveling internationally independently , " says @entity44			1
@entity171 in @entity171 , one - on - one contact is still more common than in other developed countries , partly due to remote credit card restrictions			0
specialty trips " agents are trying to differentiate themselves , to be much more specialist , " says @entity118			2
niches catering to specific activities , sports and students are viable or those catering to journalist and nonprofit circles			0
@entity101 fielded calls in the middle of the night from journalists leaving at the last minute to cover the @entity188 , or trying to get out of @entity189 or @entity190 asap			0
normally seats ca n't be booked online within six hours of departure , but @entity101 has booked seats as clients rush to the airport			0
what 's next ? social media and travel apps are expected to continue to whittle away at the remaining agency share			1
agents who embrace technology to improve their clients ' experience -- say , with webcast discussions with a rep -- can improve their chances of survival			0
it seems that those who initially predicted technology would eclipse the need for human agents underestimated the needs of @entity215 , @entity216 , executives , the wealthy and the super-niche			0
the travel agent as we knew it is dying			0
but it 's not yet dead			0
do you prefer to book online or via an agent ? tell us why in the comments .			0

travel agents in the @entity19 down from 34,000 to 13,000
but they still made $ 95 billion in 2011
