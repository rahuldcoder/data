@entity1 , @entity0 -- it was early one sunday morning when the killer rang at a front door that was decorated with a wreath for @entity7			2
when his victim answered , he fired four fatal shots , ran off and disappeared			2
police hope the new fingerprinting technique could detectives find new clues on murder weapons			1
the unsolved murder of @entity16 , 68 , in a town near @entity18 , @entity19 , in december 2007 has left investigators with few clues and few leads			1
they recovered the gun used in the crime a few months later , but the gunman 's identity -- and his motive -- remain a mystery			2
now , a groundbreaking technique developed across the @entity30 in @entity31 may help @entity19 police and others to crack cold cases like this			1
the technique enables scientists to detect fingerprints on spent bullets and shell casings , even when the print had been wiped off			1
it works by detecting the minute corrosion of metal caused by sweat , which corrodes the metal in the shape of the fingerprint			1
" that sweat is in the pattern of the original fingerprint that was deposited , " said @entity49 , a forensic scientist for @entity0 's @entity50 and a researcher at the @entity52 , who developed the technique			1
the corrosion is often impossible to see with the naked eye because it 's so small -- as small as a micron , which is a millionth of a meter , @entity49 said			1
his method involves dusting the metal with a fine black powder that adheres to the corroded areas , allowing scientists to see the fingerprint			1
a detective from the police department in @entity69 , @entity19 , where @entity70 lived in a gabled home with her husband , went to meet @entity49 late last year , @entity49 and the department said			1
@entity49 was able to obtain a print from the shell casings in the @entity70 case , meaning police could be able to discern who loaded the gun , if they can find a match , @entity74 investigator @entity73 told @entity2			1
police are optimistic @entity49 's technique will bring them another step closer to solving the case			1
" prior to ( the detective ) coming over , and one of the reasons he came over , is they had little or no forensic evidence for this murder , " @entity49 said			2
" so my own feeling would be that finding fingerprints would be significant			2
" investigators believe @entity70 may have been the victim of mistaken identity , according to a profile of the case posted on the web site for the television show " @entity102 , " which featured the case			2
a neighbor whose address is very similar to @entity70 's told police she had recently gone through a bitter divorce , and that she and her ex-husband had an ongoing business dispute , according to the web site			1
large amounts of money were at stake , the show said , and the woman believed she was the intended target			1
investigators traced the gun 's history to a man who is now deceased and , authorities believe , had no connection to the slaying , according to the television show 's web site			0
police believe the gun has changed hands several times since then and are still seeking information on its latest owners			1
the bullet fingerprinting technique wo n't necessarily solve crimes like the @entity70 case but could unearth new clues , @entity49 said			1
" it 's helping police get evidence they did n't have before , " he said			1
" it 's simply a new line of inquiry and can be especially valuable with cold cases			0
" in september , @entity49 found fingerprints on a shell casing from another murder case -- a 1999 double homicide in @entity145 , @entity146			0
in that case , the suspect or suspects entered a @entity151 business downtown , shot and killed the two employees and stole a small amount of money , said @entity145 police lieutenant @entity155			1
police assigned a full - time cold case detective , @entity158 , to the case because of " some things that had changed			1
" the department read about @entity49 's technique in a magazine article and contacted him to see if he could help , he said			1
" we were interested in trying anything we could , " @entity155 said			0
four shell casings had been found at the crime scene , but fingerprint testing using traditional techniques did n't reveal anything of use			0
@entity49 was able to find fingerprint ridges on three of the four casings , and one of them yielded enough ridge detail to possibly provide an identification , a @entity52 statement said , quoting @entity158			0
@entity155 would only say that more than one shell casing was found at the scene , and said @entity49 was able to get results for detectives			0
he declined to say more , citing the ongoing investigation			0
" the results are surprising , " the university statement quoted @entity158 as saying			0
" i feel very optimistic			0
these results are better than i had expected and better than i hoped for			0
" @entity49 does n't advertise his services , which he performs free of charge			0
" all of the inquiries we 've had from the @entity191 police forces have all been initiated by them , " he told @entity2			2
" we never say no , so anybody who says , ' i 've got some shell casings , we have some over 30 years old ' -- we always say send them and we 'll have a look			0
" @entity49 says he tries to know as little about a case as possible before he looks for fingerprints , so no one can accuse him later of looking for something specific			0
in one case , he said , he found a partial print on a shell casing sent in by police in @entity205 , @entity206			2
the detective told him it was a fingerprint they expected him to find			0
" that was confirmation for me " that the technique worked , @entity49 said			2
the technique wo n't work , however , if a person has just washed their hands or put on gloves before loading a gun			2
but @entity49 said that 's not too much of a concern			0
" because of the nature of who these people are and the nature of what they 're committing , personal hygiene is not foremost in their mind when they 're doing this , " @entity49 said			0
" it 's also the heat of the moment			0
they might be sweating , perspiring , because you know you 're going to go out and break the law			0
" -- @entity2 's @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity146 , contributed to this report .			0
