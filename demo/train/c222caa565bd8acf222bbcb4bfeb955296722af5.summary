@entity0 , @entity1 -- the trial of controversial @entity1 politician @entity4 took a new twist tuesday when prosecutors told the judge they wanted to impeach their star witness			1
the prosecution called arms dealer @entity10 to the stand to implicate @entity4 in the procurement of the arms			1
@entity4 is a senior official of the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and @entity1 's deputy agriculture minister - designate			1
he has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism and inciting people to carry out terrorism			0
he could face the death penalty if convicted			0
the @entity15 -- led by prime minister @entity22 -- says the case against @entity4 is politically motivated and was aimed at keeping him out of the unity government it formed with president @entity27 's @entity26 last february			1
under questioning from attorney general @entity28 , @entity10 testified he had seen @entity4 on television and then had met him at a public gathering			1
but @entity10 told the fully packed courtroom that he was not aware of some of the weapons the prosecution claims that he bought with the financial support of @entity4			2
in addition , @entity10 -- who appeared relaxed throughout the proceedings -- cast doubt on the authenticity of e-mails that were produced in court which the prosecution said had been retrieved from his laptop and which allegedly reveal that he and @entity4 were planning to commit terrorism			1
" none of the contents was retrieved from my laptop in my absence or in the presence of my legal counsel ( in 2006 when he was arrested ) , " he said , adding , " i do n't know here they came from			0
" after that , @entity28 started questioning @entity10 as if he were a hostile witness and not the star witness for the prosecution			1
@entity4 's lawyers objected , saying the prosecution was trying to " confuse " people			1
at that point , @entity28 indicated that he was in the " preparatory stage " to " to lay evidence that @entity10 was being inconsistent			0
" " the witness -- who is an accomplice witness by the way -- is getting to be a witness in favor of the accused ; we are entitled to start impeachment procedures when the state witness starts showing that he is being unfavorably indisposed in favor of the accused , " he added			0
@entity4 's lawyer , @entity71 , said the prosecution had never indicated that it had e-mails which were purportedly written by her client and @entity10			1
she said @entity10 had submitted an affidavit saying he does not want to testify against @entity4 , adding that the statements about conspiracy that were purportedly made by him were done under " traumatic and unfriendly circumstances " in 2006 , when he was arrested and later charged with terrorism himself			2
@entity71 said the prosecution was attempting to take a statement @entity10 made to the army and turn it into a statement against her client			0
" that is an army - procured statement			0
what legal basis is there to change it to a witness statement ? the statement was made when he was an accused facing conspiracy charges , " said @entity71			0
" during that time the prosecution did not indicate that he had acted in common purpose with the accused ( @entity4 )			2
" @entity10 was acquitted of terrorism charges in 2006 but served a jail sentence for the lesser charge of possessing weapons without a license			0
the weapons allegedly included six sub-machine guns and two machine guns , which the prosecution produced in @entity4 's trial as part of the state 's exhibits			1
the judge in the case , justice @entity109 , who resumed the trial after adjourning it last november , is expected to rule wednesday whether the state can proceed to impeach its own witness			2
throughout the court proceedings , @entity4 -- clad in a blue suit , matching blue tie and a light blue shirt -- sat motionless , gazing into the sky once in a while			2
he laughed out loud when @entity10 said he first saw @entity4 on television punching the justice minister in parliament .			0
