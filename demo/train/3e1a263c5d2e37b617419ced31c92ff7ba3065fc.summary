as hospitals in nations hardest hit by @entity5 struggle to keep up , desperate patients are turning to the black market to buy blood from survivors of the virus , the @entity0 warned			1
the deadliest @entity5 outbreak in history has killed at least 2,400 people in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- the countries most affected by the virus			1
blood from survivors , referred to as convalescent serum , is said to have antibodies that can fight the deadly virus			1
though the treatment is unproven , it has provided some promise for those fighting a disease that 's killing more than half of those it has infected			0
" studies suggest blood transfusions from survivors might prevent or treat ebola virus infection in others , but the results of the studies are still difficult to interpret , " the @entity0 said			1
" it is not known whether antibodies in the plasma of survivors are sufficient to treat or prevent the disease			0
" convalescent serum has been used to treat patients , including @entity46 aid worker @entity45 , who is hospitalized in @entity47 , @entity48			1
he got blood from @entity51 , a fellow @entity46 who survived @entity5			2
both got infected when they were helping patients in @entity14			0
but unlike their situation , patients in affected nations are getting blood through improper channels			1
the illicit trade can lead to the spread of other infections , including @entity61 and other blood - related ailments			0
" we need to work very closely with the affected countries to stem out black market trading of convalescent serum for two reasons , " @entity68 , the @entity0 's director - general , said this week			1
" because it is in the interest of individuals not to just get convalescent serum without ... going through the proper standard and the proper testing because it is important that there may be other infectious vectors that we need to look at			1
" ' just sitting , waiting to die ' @entity79 experts have declared the disease a global emergency and criticized the international community for a lax response			0
president @entity84 on tuesday announced the @entity46 will send troops , material to build field hospitals , additional health care workers and community care kits to affected nations			2
the @entity46 will also create a facility to help train thousands of health care workers to identify and care for @entity5 patients			2
" men and women and children are just sitting , waiting to die right now , " @entity84 said			0
hospitals in affected nations are overwhelmed , and the @entity0 has described the outbreak as a " dire emergency with ... unprecedented dimensions " of human suffering			1
" if the outbreak is not stopped now , we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us , " @entity84 said			0
what you need to know about the ebola virus there is also a concern that the virus could mutate into an even more dangerous form			0
@entity5 currently transmits only through contact with bodily fluids ; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to people worldwide , experts say			2
meanwhile , a @entity123 volunteer with @entity124 contracted @entity5 in @entity14 and will be taken to @entity125 for further treatment , the group said thursday			0
a private @entity46 plane will be used for the evacuation , according to the organization , which is known by its @entity123 acronym , @entity124 .			0
