" @entity2 , where do allergies come from ? " the question , from a boy sitting at a table near mine , caught my attention			2
obviously a pro at handling the random curiosities of a young child , his mom said : " from flowers and grass and foods like peanuts			2
" the boy went back to his meal , seemingly satisfied with her answer			2
scientists know what causes allergies			1
when particles of pollen , pet dander or certain types of food enter our bodies , they 're called antigens			2
if your body has a sensitivity to that particle , it mistakes the harmless element for a dangerous invader , according to the @entity38			1
the particle then becomes what we call an allergen , although a sensitivity to a substance alone does n't guarantee you will develop an allergy			1
allergens cause your body to produce @entity46 , or @entity46 , antibodies			0
antibodies are used to identify and destroy dangerous invaders			0
unfortunately , ige antibodies also release histamine and other chemicals that can create an allergic reaction			0
but what causes one person to become sensitive to these indiscriminate antigens floating through the air , while another sails through life with dry eyes and clear sinuses ? scientists are n't exactly sure , but they have a few ideas			1
dr. @entity63 has been studying allergies since the early 1980s			0
her research team at @entity66 was the first to show that having a pet in the house during your child 's first year of life may protect him or her from developing allergies -- a finding that 's since been duplicated in other studies			0
her latest research suggests allergy development starts even before that			1
@entity63 analyzed data from a group of more than 1,200 newborns who were born in @entity82 between 2003 and 2007 , and have been evaluated by researchers at 1 month , 6 months , 1 year and 2 years old			1
acupuncture may be antidote for allergies she found that babies born by cesarean section are six times more likely to be sensitive to dust mite allergens than babies born naturally			1
the researcher found similar results for exposure to cat - and dog - hair allergens			0
babies who are born via c - section have a different microbiome in their gastrointestinal tract , @entity63 said			1
a microbiome is what scientists use to describe the bacteria communities that reside in humans , whether it 's in our mouths , on our skin or in our digestive system			1
" it 's pretty astonishing			0
in human beings , bacterial cells outnumber human cells 10 to 1 , " @entity63 said			0
" these bacteria are important -- we could n't exist without them			1
" in the womb , babies are sterile , @entity63 explained			0
when they go through the birth canal , they get exposed to the entire bacteria population of their mother 's vaginal and @entity126 microbiomes			0
through this exposure , their own immune systems learn the difference between good and bad bacteria -- i.e. what to fight off and what to use			0
babies born through c - section have bacteria in their gut that more closely resembles their mother 's skin microbiome , @entity63 said			2
eventually their digestive bacteria normalize , but that delay could give allergen exposure time to develop into a sensitivity			2
of course , that 's just one possible cause of allergies -- or just one possible cause of many possible causes			0
@entity63 's colleague dr. @entity152 , an allergist at @entity153 , is looking into how genetics may play a role			1
@entity152 's latest study found @entity159 - @entity158 children are sensitized to food allergens three times more often than @entity163 children			1
it also concluded that an @entity159 - @entity158 kid with an allergic parent is twice as likely to be sensitized to an environmental allergen than an @entity159 - @entity158 kid without an allergic parent			1
@entity152 said her results did n't change with the child 's birth order -- another possible allergy risk factor -- or if the child was male or female			1
race alone put them at a higher risk			0
" this suggests that ( allergies ) might be genetic , " @entity152 said , something scientists have long suspected			2
but it 's not like a genetic disease that 's 100 % inherited			0
" there 's no one gene for allergies or asthma			0
it 's probably a combination of multiple genes interacting somehow with the environment			2
" up to 50 million @entity158 have some kind of allergy , according to the @entity193			1
@entity194 , a dermatologist at @entity195 in @entity196 , recently analyzed data from more than 91,000 children to determine whether children born outside the @entity158 were as likely as @entity158 children to develop allergies			1
he found that foreign - born children residing in the @entity158 had half the risk of developing allergies than those who were born here			1
that was true for all types of allergies , including food allergies , although the association was strongest for asthma			0
when food allergies are a weapon for bullies @entity194 and his colleagues started the study after realizing they were seeing foreign - born children at their practice developing allergies much later in life			2
they found that the foreign - born kids who lived in the @entity158 for more than 10 years had a higher prevalence of allergies than the children who had only been in the country for a couple of years			1
scientists know that environmental exposures play a role in allergic disease ; you ca n't be sensitized to something you 've never been exposed to			1
but in the past researchers have focused on allergens in the air , @entity194 said , such as pollen or ragweed , instead of other environmental exposures			0
these other factors could be related to a child 's climate , diet or geography - specific infections			0
" what ( this study shows ) is that there 's something about what we 're experiencing in the @entity158 compared to many other countries that seems to really lead people to , or unmask , allergic disease , " he said			1
which factor -- if any -- plays the dominant role is so far unclear			2
it 's hard to make any practical conclusions from these kinds of studies , @entity194 said			0
but eventually knowing where allergies come from could help us figure out a way to prevent them , or at least treat them more effectively			0
then allergy sufferers will be able to frolic in the flowers and roll in the grass and eat peanuts just like everyone else			2
global warming brings on pollen apocalypse			0

up to 50 million @entity158 have some kind of allergy
scientists do n't know yet what causes a sensitivity
environment , genetics , even the way you were born could play a role
