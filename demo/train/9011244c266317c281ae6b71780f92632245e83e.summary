-- @entity1 , @entity2 : headbands are back ! if you 're not a fan of " @entity7 , " that reference was probably lost on you , but that does n't mean you 're unfamiliar with the @entity10 series ' impact on fashion , and one hair accessory in particular			1
thanks to countless pleas from fans , costume designer @entity14 is bringing back @entity19 's ( @entity20 ) headbands			1
" we tried to ( compensate ) with the hats last year , but it did n't seem to have the same impact , " @entity14 said			2
" i feel like the headband was such a thing for her when she was in high school			0
we wanted to segue out of it for a little bit			0
" going into its sixth and final , season , " @entity7 " would rather recycle an on - screen relationship than an outfit			1
while some characters have found themselves back in the arms of past lovers , " every handbag , every shoe , every accessory , every piece of clothing is only used for the scene that it 's in , " @entity14 said			1
with the exception of some of the men 's suits and dress shirts , that is			2
season six , which premieres october 8 , will be no exception			2
in addition to @entity53 's headbands , @entity14 said , fans can expect a " rich fall color palette " complete with " deep sapphire blues , military olives , delicious aubergines punctuated by pops of fuchsia			1
" and look for " neons and acidic yellows in the way of accessories , shoes and bags			0
" rather than the statement jewelry the characters have rocked of late , @entity14 said , it 's all about delicate layering pieces this season			1
he called jewelry designer @entity71 " one of this season 's best discoveries			1
" @entity75 fashion : outfitting ' revenge ' @entity14 comes from " @entity76 , " where he was an assistant costume designer on seasons 2 , 3 and 4			1
he said his reputation , from working alongside @entity78 on the @entity80 series , was one reason designers were excited about getting involved with " @entity7 " early on			2
" it 's an honor and a privilege for me to be able to have access to all these amazing designers			2
... if i tried to do the show on our budget , there 'd be no way it would look like it does			0
" viewers should expect to see pieces by @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 on screen this fall			1
but outfitting a show like " @entity7 " is n't as simple as just plucking looks from the runway			1
@entity14 styles each ensemble , putting different pieces together to create something unique , like @entity111 van der @entity115 's ( @entity114 ) @entity113 bag and @entity117 laptop case , which peeked out of the tote			1
it did n't take long before blogs were buzzing about the combo			0
@entity75 fashion : outfitting ' @entity123 ' " all the characters have really grown in story and in style , " @entity14 said , " making statements and fashion headlines with their wardrobe choices on the way			1
" @entity131 , played by @entity132 , has had a significant style transformation , @entity14 added : he 's gone from " bad - boy billionaire to seriously suited business maven			1
" @entity136 -- @entity138 ' character in 1987 's " @entity139 " -- and @entity140 -- @entity142 's character in 2000 's " @entity143 " -- both inspired @entity131 's current style , @entity14 said			2
" ( @entity131 ) can wear whatever he wants , " @entity14 said			2
" he can wear a pink suit and an ascot and pull it off			0
... when you have men wearing pastels , there 's kind of a power behind the sexuality , i think			0
" @entity53 and @entity111 have also come a long way from the @entity159 uniforms they wore for the better part of the show 's first and second seasons			0
@entity75 fashion : outfitting ' scandal ' " the challenge really was ... giving them each their own kind of identity , " @entity14 said of accessorizing their uniforms			2
" @entity53 obviously started with the headband , and then it became giant ruffled bow blouses and fuller skirts			0
... whereas @entity111 was wearing her skirt from when she was a sophomore , which was a different plaid			0
... it was a little shorter and just kind of worked with who her character was			0
and to make her more boho chic , she was wearing t - shirts and not proper blouses ... then we 'd accessorize her with sparkly cardigans or great little leather vests			0
" giving the actors an identity through their wardrobe really helps them " generate who they need to be for their characters , " he added			0
and while @entity14 notes many high points in his five years working on the series , his proudest moment came during season 2 , when he watched his own creation walk the runway in " @entity202			2
" " it was a @entity205 ( @entity204 ) design that @entity111 ( @entity114 ) wore ... a green bubble dress she wore in an @entity209 ( @entity208 ) fashion show , " he said			0
" it fit @entity114 ( @entity211 ) like a glove , and it was just one of those moments where i was like , wow , that 's really a great dress			0
" @entity14 teased that there 's a possibility season 6 will call for more original designs			1
in which case , viewers might get to see more from him			0
either way , fans will see @entity14 channel a different decade on the ' 80s - set " @entity76 " prequel , " the @entity224 , " which is expected to debut on the @entity10 in january			1
@entity14 drew from his experience as an assistant costume designer on the original series to reinvent @entity228 as a teenage girl			1
" as ( @entity231 , played by @entity232 ) , grows up , we 're going to see the development of her fashion style grow and understand where it all comes from , " he said			0
in the meantime , @entity14 is excited for fans to see what he 's got up his sleeves for the last season of " @entity7			1
" given the state of the economy , he said , " people just enjoyed getting lost in the drama and the jewels and the sparkly - ness			0
