-- say hello to your latest personal navigation device : a netbook			0

@entity4 will introduce a @entity6 and @entity7 card that can be added to its netbooks to offer turn - by - turn direction			1
" smartphones already have gps capabilities , " says @entity17 , senior wireless product manager at @entity4			2
" we are now bringing it to netbooks so the devices know where you are and can help you where you want to go			0
" customers will have the option to buy the $ 69 card called the @entity29 when ordering their @entity31 netbook			0
@entity4 's move comes at a time when navigation devices makers are looking beyond the traditional standalone @entity6 gadget and are offering their software on other devices			1
last month , @entity14 announced that its turn - by - turn directions app would be available on the @entity39			1
@entity14 will also offer accessories such as a car mounting dock and power charger			0
meanwhile , @entity4 is hoping to capitalize on the explosive sales of netbooks			2
@entity4 netbooks with the integrated gps cards will allow consumers to pop open a netbook and get directions and also also make their netbook location aware			1
for instance , buyers can geo - tag photos on @entity54 or check weather information customized to their current location			1
the wireless 700 card combines @entity60 's gps technology and @entity62 positioning solutions			2
as for the navigation software , it offers @entity65 and 3d map views , save addresses for a trip and route optimization -- pretty much all the things that a standard gps devices does			2
