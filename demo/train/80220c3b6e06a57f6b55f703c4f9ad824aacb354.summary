-- a massive iceberg -- more than twice the size of @entity6 's @entity5 island -- is drifting slowly toward @entity7 , scientists said wednesday			1
the iceberg , measuring 140 square km ( 54 square miles ) , cleaved off an ice shelf nearly 10 years ago and had been floating near @entity9 before commencing on its unusual journey north			1
named @entity13 , it was about 1,700 km ( 1,056 miles ) off the coast of @entity7 , according to the country 's @entity15			1
" @entity13 is a very significant one in that it has drifted so far north while still largely intact , " said @entity18 glaciologist @entity17 , who spotted the slab using satellite images taken by @entity21 and the @entity22			2
" it 's one of the biggest sighted at those latitudes			0
" it is unlikely to drift too close to the coast in its current form , @entity17 said			0
the warmer waters will cause it to melt			0
" as the water warms up , the iceberg is slowly breaking up , resulting in hundreds more smaller icebergs in the area , " @entity17 said on the @entity18 web site			2
in november , an iceberg estimated to be 500 meters wide and 50 meters high was spotted close to @entity38 in the @entity39 drifting towards @entity40			1
scientists working on the island were astounded by its size			0
" we pulled out the binoculars that we use for work on the seals and , sure enough , it was a huge floating island of ice basically and , yeah , it was an incredible sight , " @entity46 researcher @entity45 told @entity0 affiliate @entity47			0
the @entity18 said the iceberg was part of a flotilla that would have broken off from a larger ice flow that possibly came from the @entity59 , @entity9 's largest			1
although shipping lanes in this region are not particularly busy in november , the icebergs prompted @entity63 to issue navigation warnings			2
three years earlier , another family of icebergs led to a small tourist boom when they drifted along the east coast of @entity40 's @entity70			1
oceanographer @entity71 told @entity72 the icebergs had " pretty much the same origin " but that some had probably been trapped in the icy seas of @entity9 for longer , before being carried north by the currents			0
however he was reluctant to cite global warming as the reason for the large - scale movement of ice			0
" we do have to a change our position a little because in 2006 we thought this was a ' once in a lifetime ' event			0
" but large ice shelf carvings , where the ice comes from , are still only carving on a 30 to 50 - year period			1

the iceberg , measuring 140 square km cleaved off an ice shelf nearly 10 years ago
named @entity13 , it was about 1,056 miles ( 1,700 km ) off the coast of @entity97
in november this year a flotilla of icebergs was spotted drifting towards @entity40 's coast
