-- when the @entity4 - @entity3 background check amendment , a modest gun restriction by any reasonable measure , was defeated , president @entity1 called it a " shameful day in @entity7			1
" but as anyone who watches @entity10 knows , it has more than its share of shameful days			1
there the deck was stacked against not only this bill , but against any bill that would restrict the proliferation of guns in any way			0
if those seeking sanity in our gun laws want to succeed , they 'd better prepare themselves for a difficult journey			0
many people thought that the @entity29 massacre changed everything about the gun debate in @entity32 , and that new legislation was inevitable			1
the first part of that belief is still true ; the second part is not			0
the bill was doomed for a number of reasons			0
the @entity40 is an extraordinarily undemocratic institution , where outsized power goes to the small , rural states with strong support for unlimited gun rights			1
the 57 million @entity32 who live in @entity45 and @entity46 get four votes in the @entity40 , all of which were in favor of background checks			1
but the 1.3 million @entity32 who live in @entity52 and @entity53 also get four votes , and they were all opposed			1
and that 's not to mention the filibuster , which allows the minority to thwart the majority 's will			0
you might not have realized it if you watched the coverage , but this background check bill was supported by a majority of the @entity40			1
and even if it had passed the @entity40 , the bill would have likely died in the @entity65 , which is tilted in favor of @entity67 , mostly because the way @entity32 are distributed			1
more @entity32 voted for democrats than @entity67 in the 2012 @entity65 elections , but @entity67 enjoy a 31 - seat advantage , meaning their leader controls the agenda and can kill any bill he and his caucus dislike			1
opinion : one way to fight guns so does this mean the @entity80 still inspires the same fear it long has among lawmakers ? not really			2
the truth is that most of the people who threatened to filibuster the background check bill are n't afraid of the @entity80			1
they 're on its side			0
they do n't need to be intimidated or even persuaded			0
take sen. @entity91 of @entity92 , who many years ago was known as a straightforward , even moderate fellow , but who at some point decided that if he did n't like a bill , the best thing to do is to simply lie about what it contained , stoke fears or both			1
he did it when he spread the " death panel " lie during the debate over health reform , and he did it again this time , telling people falsely that the @entity4 - @entity3 amendment would mean a national registry of every @entity32 who owns a gun			1
he then warned darkly , " when registration fails , the next move will be gun confiscation			0
" for the record , the @entity4 - @entity3 amendment specifically forbade the government from creating a gun registry , which is why @entity1 and sen. @entity4 of @entity118 -- a guy from a state @entity1 lost by 27 points in 2012 , who got elected to the @entity40 with an ad showing him firing a rifle shot through a piece of legislation while the announcer trumpeted his @entity80 endorsement -- accused the @entity80 and its supporters of lying about it			1
but @entity91 and others spread the lie , knowing it would energize the paranoid and influence the more cowardly of their colleagues			1
as one gun lobbyist gloated after the bill was defeated , " the gun registry defined the battle over universal background checks			2
" we should n't have been too surprised			0
but one of the salutary effects of this debate is how it has brought to wider public attention the kind of unhinged conspiracy theorizing , paranoia and outright hate most @entity32 would n't know about if they had n't been attending @entity80 meetings or reading pro-gun web sites in recent years			1
the insanity of some of those who opposed this bill was captured by the @entity156 radio host who said to the @entity29 families , " i 'm sorry that you suffered a tragedy , but you know what ? deal with it , and do n't force me to lose my liberty , which is a greater tragedy than your loss			0
" that 's right -- having to get a background check when you buy a gun at a gun show is worse than having your child murdered			1
for good measure , he added that if he had the opportunity to meet those families , " i would stand in front of them and tell them , ' go to hell			0
' " opinion : loved ones lost to bullets most gun owners would hear that and be disgusted , just as most gun owners think universal background checks are perfectly reasonable			2
so now , gun safety advocates have to change how they think of their cause			0
it would have been nice if we could have made our gun laws a little more sane in this first try , but sometimes , change takes longer			0
but change is already underway			0
for 15 years , the debate on guns in @entity32 was no debate at all			2
one side would scream , " they 're coming for your guns ! " and the other side would respond , " ca n't we talk about something else ? " now we actually have a debate with two sides			0
@entity208 politicians ( and a few @entity67 ) are no longer so afraid to say that the right to bear arms is not infinite ; like every other right in the @entity213 , it 's subject to reasonable limits			0
the money from the gun manufacturers and the @entity80 will be met with an equally well - funded campaign -- and maybe more well - funded -- from @entity218			1
in fact , this defeat may be just what the gun safety movement needs to energize its supporters			0
talk to liberals a day after the vote , and you 'll hear anger , frustration and disgust at the craven senators who could n't stand up to the gun lobby			2
those emotions are exactly what spur people to become involved			0
if they want to succeed , in the coming months and years , they 'll need to make sure their voices are as loud as those of the @entity80 and its supporters			2
a number on a poll , like the 90 % of @entity32 who support universal background checks , is n't politically meaningful unless it inspires some fear in lawmakers			1
this time around , they obviously were n't afraid enough			2
but if support for new gun measures can become an actual movement again -- with letters and phone calls and contributions and door knocking and an unmistakable message to candidates that there will be a price to be paid for going against it -- then next time around , they may be			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity263 .			2

@entity263 : background check failure another shameful day for a cowardly @entity10
@entity40 undemocratic , he says ; small rural states have outsized power
he says sen. @entity91 spread lies to kill legislation
@entity263 : this time , @entity32 got to see power of @entity80 - stoked paranoia
