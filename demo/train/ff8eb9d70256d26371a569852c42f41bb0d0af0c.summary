-- in all of the fallout surrounding the prisoner exchange for @entity4 sgt. @entity3 , let 's get these points out of the way : the case for leaving no soldier behind is a sound and important one — a way to keep faith with our troops			1
there is historical precedent for the exchange of prisoners			2
president @entity19 likely has the legal authority he needs , as commander in chief , to order a swap			1
did the president notify @entity23 — as in the @entity25 chairwoman of the @entity26 — in a timely manner beforehand ? no. had this been a matter of some internal controversy for years precisely because of the nature of any trade ? yes			2
was the @entity33 aware of the questionable circumstances of @entity3 's disappearance ? yes			1
should national security adviser @entity36 have thought twice before describing him as someone who " served with honor and distinction			1
" yes , because the jury is most definitely out on that one			2
should the president have held a triumphal newser in the @entity44 to announce the release and swap ? um , no. absolutely no. " the point is , you have to get him home as a way to keep faith with our troops , " says a former senior national security official			1
then you deal with him and the circumstances of his departure			0
" as for the ceremony in the president 's backyard ? " that was surreal , " he says			1
" opinion : five tough ethics issues in @entity3 swap in a way , it 's all surreal and hard to unspool			1
so let 's start at the policy end of all of this			2
this is a president whose legacy is up for grabs			0
one important piece : ending two wars ( @entity77 and @entity78 ) and capturing and killing @entity79			1
" this ( the @entity3 swap ) is tying up loose ends , " says another former senior national security source			1
" the administration made the decision not to leave any people there , so that was that			2
" the @entity89 , of course , argue that a virtually 100 % withdrawal is wrong			0
that the president should have instead planned for a gradual withdrawal , depending on circumstances on the ground			0
then he might not have felt such pressure to clear the decks and cut this deal			0
or do a victory lap in the @entity44			1
it is , they charge , pure politics			0
then @entity19 played right into their hands			1
trouble is , @entity89 are playing at it , too			0
they 're tweeting their joy about @entity3 's release one minute , then un-tweeting it the next			1
@entity110 sen. @entity110 charged that this is the president 's backdoor way of emptying out @entity113 without having to close it			2
who are the @entity113 detainees ? this is a serious matter			0
years of internal deliberations have gone into this , according to my sources			0
that 's why the @entity33 needs to make it clear why the swap was a matter so urgent that there was n't enough time to notify the appropriate people , much less consult with them			1
was @entity3 swap legal ? depends on who you ask understandably , there were concerns about his safety			1
and even given all the delicacies of revealing health issues , it 's still an important matter to explain			2
because right now , it looks like the lack of consultation is about one thing : the knowledge that there would be pushback			0
and , as one source puts it , " fighting over process is always easier than fighting over substance			0
" in other words , it 's easier to apologize than ask for permission			2
now the administration has fights on both of those fronts			0
at least they 're consistent : micromanaging foreign policy from the west wing has always been a hallmark			0
not that it wins you any friends — or political support			0
guess it 's too late for that now			2
if this were @entity167 , a replica of @entity169 could have swooped in to the rescue , just like they did in 2011			0
ironically , my sources say , the @entity79 raid itself complicated events : if @entity3 was in @entity177 , would that inflame an already inflamed relationship due to the @entity79 raid ? was the intel good enough ? was the considerable risk worth it ? @entity184 video shows @entity3 's release in @entity78 the backdrop to all of this is that the same questions that are now being raised publicly had been raised internally for years — about what a " fair " trade would include			1
as @entity0 's @entity192 has reported , then - secretary of state @entity191 was skeptical of early plans to trade five @entity113 prisoners for @entity3			1
and as my national security source adds , " people opposed the deal because it was n't great			0
" but , he adds , " they were also looking at a deal that would provoke negotiations with the @entity184			0
" @entity191 wanted tougher deal for @entity3 that is not the case now			1
the conflict is winding down			0
sgt. @entity3 gets to go home			1
what lingers , sadly , is the unsettling reality that five really , really bad guys have a ticket home , too .			0

@entity215 : many of the questions surrounding @entity3 swap are *answerable*
but she says it 's hard to understand why there was a @entity44 *announcement*
should @entity36 have said he served with " honor and distinction " ?
@entity215 : @entity19 's decision to pull out of @entity78 may have dictated swap
