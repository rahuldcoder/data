@entity0 -- what had been planned as an extended weekend work day in the @entity5 murder trial abruptly ended saturday morning as the judge overseeing the case ordered a recess over the sudden emergence of what one analyst said must be a major issue			1
" obviously it 's big , and obviously it 's troublesome and obviously it 's something that ca n't be disclosed , " @entity14 legal analyst @entity13 said			2
judge @entity18 emerged from his chambers saturday morning after nearly an hour of discussions with attorneys both in and out of the courtroom to announce the day 's planned testimony would be canceled			1
he said only that the delay was due to a legal issue unrelated to complaints prosecutors raised first thing saturday morning about expected testimony from @entity30 , a chemistry expert the defense had planned to call saturday			1
a defense attorney said he was hoping for a " quick resolution			1
" we are expecting the trial to continue on monday , " attorney @entity35 said			1
@entity39 's lawyers are trying to discredit the prosecution theory that the @entity0 woman rendered her 2 - year - old daughter @entity5 unconscious with chloroform , duct - taped her mouth and nose and stored the body in her trunk for a few days before dumping it in the woods			1
@entity39 , 25 , is charged with seven counts , including first - degree murder			2
the defense says @entity5 accidentally drowned in the family pool and that @entity39 and her father panicked and covered it up			1
in what has become a familiar strain during the trial , prosecutor @entity55 complained to perry that defense attorneys did n't disclose @entity30 's plans to testify about things that were n't contained in his initial report provided to prosecutors or mentioned in his formal interview with them			1
@entity18 has previously admonished @entity66 for failing to disclose planned testimony to prosecutors , going so far as to say he will consider contempt proceedings against him once the trial is over			1
@entity30 was to testify about explanations for vile odors and the presence of chloroform in the trunk of @entity5 's car , where prosecutors claim she stored the body of her daughter before dumping the remains in a wooded field			1
chloroform can be given off by a decomposing body			0
one prosecution expert described the levels of the substance in the trunk of @entity39 's white @entity88 as " shockingly high			0
" several witnesses also testified for the state about odors that they said smelled like the unmistakable scent of human decomposition			0
@entity30 did not provide specific alternative explanations for the presence of odors or chloroform in his initial report or in his interview with prosecutors , @entity55 complained			0
" once again we are in the position of experts having supplemented their opinions without notifying the state , " @entity55 said			0
defense attorney @entity66 disagreed , saying nothing in @entity30 's planned testimony differed from his previous opinions			1
" mr. @entity55 can continue to make these allegations and make these allegations and then suddenly they become true in his world , " @entity66 said			2
" but i do not believe they are true			0
" @entity18 indicated that he would not allow @entity30 to testify on saturday , but did n't rule on the controversy before ordering the trial to recess until 8:30 a.m. monday morning			1
but he did hint at his frustration			0
" you would think this would have grown old by now but i guess some things never change , " he said			0
saturday marked the end of the fifth week of testimony in the trial , which began with opening statements on may 24			1
@entity18 lengthened saturday 's work day from the usual half - day in an effort to speed the trial 's conclusion			1
he originally told jurors , who are being housed in an @entity0 hotel shielded from media coverage of the trial , that the trial could last six to eight weeks			2
on friday -- before saturday 's delay -- @entity66 said he expected the defense to rest on wednesday or possibly thursday			2
that would leave room for a rebuttal case from the prosecution and closing statements before the @entity140 holiday			0
it is unclear how saturday 's delay will affect those plans			0
@entity39 could face the death penalty if convicted of the most serious charge , first - degree murder			2
the charges against her also include misleading authorities and aggravated child abuse			0
@entity5 was not reported missing to police until july 15 , 2008 , when @entity39 's mother , @entity5 , tracked down her daughter and demanded answers regarding @entity5 's whereabouts			1
prosecution witnesses described @entity39 's behavior in the month after @entity5 was last seen as nonchalant , testifying how she spent time with her boyfriend , went shopping and to nightclubs			2
@entity66 said in his opening statement that @entity39 behaved as she did because years of sexual abuse by her father had conditioned her to conceal the truth and hide her pain			0
@entity39 has denied the claims that he abused his daughter or helped conceal his granddaughter 's death			0
in @entity170 's @entity169 and @entity171 contributed to this report			0
watch @entity173 monday through sunday starting at 8 p.m. et on @entity14			0
