-- @entity2 's @entity1 is now safely back home and tucked - up behind palace walls after taking his first tentative steps into a lifetime of public duties			1
in the end , he only officially appeared twice during the @entity11 and @entity11 of @entity13 's tour of @entity14 and @entity15			1
first , at a play date in @entity18 , then at @entity19 in @entity20 , but we also caught glimpses of him getting on and off planes			0
so what did we learn about this little monarch - in - waiting ? well for a start , he is n't little			1
the other babies invited to the play date were all born within a few weeks of @entity30 and he was by far the biggest , and he 's quick			1
" very strong , very mobile , very happy , very active , " said @entity31 , who was one of the parents invited to the event			0
another described the prince as " intrepid			0
" @entity30 the world could n't resist those chubby cheeks and social media was awash with the pictures with the word " cute			0
" the @entity2 photographer who captured the images was @entity44 , also part of the close - up team at the zoo where @entity30 met a bilby			1
" you could tell he 's more playful at the bilby event , " said @entity44			1
" he 's not afraid			2
he 's very happy to play			2
he 's obviously at the cruising stage			2
he pulled himself up at the bilby enclosure , just to get a closer look and to try and stroke him			0
he looks strong , and i ca n't believe it will be very long until he starts to walk			0
" this is exactly the age when i remember my babies starting to transform and i could see that in @entity30 over the course of the three - week tour as well			1
if i compare the boy arriving in @entity18 and to the one leaving the tour in @entity68 , his " @entity66 " hairstyle was more pronounced and he looked older			2
@entity44 , who was next to me at both airports , said : " he 's transformed from a baby to a toddler in the course of a royal tour			1
" @entity74 ? newspapers and websites have been having fun with some of @entity30 's faces			2
so is he really grumpy ? " no , " says @entity44			0
" he 's got lovely chubby cheeks and he 's full of expression			0
he 's obviously teething and that 'll make any toddler a little fractious			0
" @entity84 so when the royals waved goodbye to @entity15 , we also waved goodbye to " @entity1			1
" the next time we see him , it 'll be the all new " @entity84 " -- and i bet he wo n't be hanging around for long			0
