in @entity1 's 1949 dystopian novel , " @entity2 , " the world is engaged in perpetual war , and citizens are under constant surveillance by a totalitarian dictator called @entity8			1
that 's , like , grody to the max , dude			1
in the summer of 1984 , @entity13 pop culture was at a neon - hued , hair - teasing , ghostbusting fever pitch			1
in the latest entry in our @entity20 series , we 're taking a look back at what made the summer 30 years ago stand out : from movie soundtracks to athletic feats to a political climate dogged by the specter of nuclear conflict			1
politics : ' morning in @entity13 , ' @entity29 in mourning the summer of 1984 fell smack dab in the middle of the @entity34 era			1
with oil prices at a low and interest rates inching upward , the so - called @entity36 president seemed virtually assured re-election over @entity40 opponent @entity29 that november			0
@entity13 had been reeling from the loss of 241 @entity42 after an attack in @entity44 , @entity45 , the previous fall , but the swiftly executed invasion of @entity48 had reaffirmed the public 's faith in @entity34 's leadership			2
@entity29 attempted to keep images of the fallen soldiers ( not to mention potential nuclear attack by unspecified foreign forces ) fresh in voters ' minds , but it was no match for the sunny optimism of @entity34 's ad " @entity62 " ( often known as " @entity61 " ) , which depicted house - buying , flag - waving , fully employed @entity13 going about their business			2
@entity29 managed only to win his home state of @entity67 and the @entity68 in the election			0
music : private dancing in the dark while doves cry let 's hear it for the boys			1
and an epic era of movie music			2
the " footloose " soundtrack , packed with powerhouse hits from @entity82 , @entity83 and others , reached its apex right at the beginning of summer ' 84 , but still pumped out of poolside boomboxes throughout the season			1
@entity99 's " @entity98 " and @entity101 's " @entity100 " skipped through the spotlight before the artist formerly and currently known as @entity92 wrested the top @entity94 spot for five consecutive weeks from july to early august with " @entity95 " from his soundtrack album " @entity97			1
" @entity102 blasted onto the @entity103 in august with a three - week stint in the top spot for his single " ghostbusters , " but who 'd he have to call ? his lawyer , apparently			2
@entity109 eventually sued the artist for $ 5 million , citing similarities between the chart topper and his hit " @entity111			0
" the matter later was settled out of court confidentially			0
a 20 - year - old @entity117 swayed onstage with @entity118 in the video for " @entity120 " -- the first single from his smash - hit album " born in the @entity13 " but it was @entity124 who capped off the season that september with three weeks in the no. 1 spot for " what 's @entity128 " from the album " private dancer			1
" the song was later used as the title for a film of @entity124 's life story , and it marked her first @entity136 single since the 1970s -- making her , at 44 , the oldest solo chart - topping female artist to date			1
movies : revenge of the ghostbusting nerd kids it 's easy to wax ( on ) rhapsodic about the silver screen in the summer of 1984 -- especially if you were an underdog			1
@entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and the late @entity147 starred as a team of misfit parapsychologists tasked with ridding @entity150 of ghosts and meddlesome gods			0
the june release of " @entity106 " slimed the competition at the box office , while @entity156 took a wild mine ride into second place with " @entity159 " after its late may release			0
a baby - faced @entity162 leg - swept his way into moviegoers ' hearts as " @entity166 " under the tutelage of handyman / martial arts expert @entity168 ( played by @entity170 )			0
@entity171 stood up to @entity166 tyrant @entity172 , played by @entity173 , who was eternally typecast as the go - to blond bully boy of the era			0
in " @entity178 , " released in july , @entity176 and @entity177 paired up to play academically inclined freshmen who eventually gain social supremacy over the jockish jerks of the @entity183 fraternity by joining forces with other outcasts , panty raiders and nose - pickers			1
" @entity191 " fed moviegoers ' appetite for cutesy horror , @entity203 's " @entity202 " became the first release to earn a first @entity194 rating for its " intensity " of violence in a fictional post-communist invasion @entity13 , and @entity198 threw a " @entity199 " that got a tad out of hand			2
@entity92 's " @entity97 " went crazy at the box office and the record stores , while " @entity207 " swung for the fences			1
the " @entity209 " franchise found its place among the season 's biggest hits with its third installment , " @entity217 " ; and the nation 's geeks ( and probably a jock or two ) commenced a collective crush on @entity221 ' red - haired muse @entity219 with her breakout role as @entity223 in " @entity224			1
" @entity225 : @entity226 , bouncing , @entity228 and bumping into history the @entity230 in @entity231 may have been boycotted by the @entity233 bloc , but @entity234 made a grand return to the @entity236 after its last outing in 1952 , taking home 15 gold medals			0
@entity239 ( and her iconic bouncy haircut ) tumbled her way into history -- and the nation 's heart -- by becoming the first @entity13 to win the women 's all - round gold medal in gymnastics			2
@entity248 was nearly booed off the track as the barefoot @entity251 runner ( competing for @entity252 ) collided with @entity13 runner @entity253 during the 3,000 - meter run for the gold medal , knocking her to the curb and out of competition			0
@entity13 runner @entity258 completed his quest to match @entity261 ' record four gold medals in a games in 1936 , but likely due to controversy over his long jump approach , fell short of the lucrative endorsement goals he 'd set for himself			0
the televised games also marked the semi-creepy public reveal of the scope of the " @entity228 " brand of products , with an omnipresent commercial campaign showing the range of common household food brands manufactured by the billion - dollar processing company			0
you 've known us all along , " the ads said			0
" is that you , @entity8 ? " responded the viewing public			0
street style : floppy , bright and totally tubular big , loose belts , sky - high hair , workout wear , @entity285 watches , neon hues , draped scarves and a surprising return to seersucker defined 1984 summer style			1
the tail end of the old - school hip - hop era ushered in a new wave helmed by @entity150 - centric artists such as @entity295 and @entity296 , and documented in the film " @entity298			0
" the b - boy culture of break dancing and graffiti art had been popular in @entity303 and @entity251 - @entity13 youth culture since the 1970s , but suddenly , it seemed as if everyone and their suburban cousin was hauling sheets of cardboard out to the sidewalk and practicing their backspins by the mesquite grill			2
tv : it was 1984			2
summer was all reruns and @entity225 , like , fer sure			0
