today millions of @entity0 are going to the ballot boxes to decide on a new constitution , the third time they have done so in as many years			1
they are voting with high hopes that this referendum will put an end to the bloodshed , social tensions and instability that followed the ouster of the @entity14 president @entity13 in july 2013			1
seen as the lynchpin in the " roadmap " that was declared soon thereafter , the referendum is to be followed by presidential and parliamentary elections			1
once these elections are conducted , it is hoped that @entity0 's revolution , which erupted exactly three years ago , will have accomplished its goals			1
however , hopes that this referendum offers a panacea to @entity0 's deep problems are wishful thinking			1
the referendum is being conducted under measures that can only be described as draconian			2
an anti-demonstration law has recently been passed and put into effect with the result that dozens of young activists who were instrumental in the 2011 revolution -- but who continue to be critical of the military -- are now behind bars			1
a ferocious publicity campaign urging people to vote " yes " is constantly blaring out of government and private media outlets			0
@entity42 says seven members of the opposition @entity44 were recently arrested for hanging posters saying " no " to the proposed constitution			2
the army is expected to deploy 160,000 troops with thousands of tanks , armored personnel carriers and helicopters to " protect the voting process			2
" the outcome of the referendum is not in doubt			2
if the preliminary results of the vote of ex-pat @entity0 who have already cast their ballots are anything to go by , the constitutional draft is expected to pass with an overwhelming majority that may approach 90 %			1
and it would be a mistake to believe that this outcome is the result only of army manipulation , intimidation and threats			0
there are millions of @entity0 who are willingly standing behind @entity71 -- the minister of defense and the mastermind of the roadmap			2
three years into the revolution , they are tired of the political instability , lack of security and deteriorating economic conditions			2
in @entity71 they see a savior whom they believe is the only one capable of lifting the country out of its crisis			0
still others have become suspicious of the revolutionary youth whom they accuse of being inexperienced , irresponsible and untrustworthy			0
but most have been so frightened by the @entity14 's brief rule and what they see as its dangerous , undemocratic maverick politics that they decided to give up essential liberty and purchase a little temporary safety			0
however , while the outcome of the referendum is assured , so too is @entity71 's failure to provide either safety or liberty to the millions of starry - eyed @entity0			1
for one thing , @entity0 's economy is nearing total collapse , with a recent report by @entity0 's @entity102 showing annual growth rates plummeting from 7.2 % before the revolution to a mere 2.1 % in 2012 - 2013			1
according to the same report , the rate of unemployment rose from 8.4 % to 13.2 % , and poverty rates worsened -- from 19.6 % in 2010 to 25.2 % in 2013			0
meanwhile , foreign reserves more than halved in the three years of the revolution			0
equally dire is the political situation			0
while the @entity14 is accused of failing fundamental democratic tests while in power , the subsequent hounding , arresting and killing of its members has only given the organization the kiss of life and assured its existence for generations to come			0
economically and politically , therefore , @entity0 's problems are of such a depth and complexity that they can not be solved by force			2
a political solution is desperately needed , one that @entity71 and his henchmen seem singularly incapable of offering			0
@entity0 thus appears to be back where it was in 2011 when its revolution erupted			1
a military dictatorship seems to be re-establishing itself , and the notorious security forces appear to be back in business , with a vengeance			1
still , as someone who took to the streets in 2011 against @entity141 , and again in 2012 and 2013 against @entity13 , i am willing to take to the streets once more against this new military dictatorship that is poised to impose itself with a civilian veneer			1
and i know that i will not be alone			0
the many @entity0 who have participated in the 2011 revolution ; those who have lost loved ones since then ; the @entity14 supporters who have been brutally suppressed and disenfranchised ; and the many more who have become deeply engaged in politics hoping for a better future -- those millions of @entity0 can not be wished away			1
they have become bolder , more vocal and more experienced			0
at the same time , the military has shown a dismal lack of political tact and strategic vision			0
@entity0 's revolution , whose tragedy it is to tackle -- at the same time -- the two intractable questions of what should be the proper role of the military in politics and what should be the proper role of religion in politics , is still in its infancy			1
the road ahead is long and bumpy			0
but i have no doubt that the future belongs to us .			0

@entity0 are voting on a draft constitution that would give the military more power
the referendum is expected to be followed by presidential and parliamentary elections
@entity182 says @entity0 appears to be back where it was at the start of the revolution
but he says if a military dictatorship tries to impose itself , street protests will return
