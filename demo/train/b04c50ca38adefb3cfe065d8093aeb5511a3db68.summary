-- earlier this month , an @entity2 plane made an important flight from @entity4 to @entity5			1
the flight was n't notable for who was inside the cabin , but for what was inside the fuel tank : it was the world 's first transatlantic commercial flight using biofuel			1
the engines on that flight were powered by a fuel mixture that was 30 % biofuel from the jatropha plant , and the trip followed a pair of @entity18 domestic commercial flights by @entity19 that used the same formula			1
@entity4 is known for its oil production , but it could be its less obvious flats of arid and marginal land that will be the future of @entity4 's energy resources			1
the country has quietly positioned itself to become a potential leader in biofuel production as scientists develop a second generation of fuels derived from sources that do n't compete for arable land or with food			1
jatropha - based biofuels are being increasingly used in @entity4 , and agave -- the plant from which tequila is made -- is being studied as a new source for ethanol			1
but some observers warn that @entity4 's cumbersome land laws make it too hard to purchase the land needed for cultivation at competitive prices			1
some biofuels , such as ethanol derived from corn and sugar , can indirectly raise the prices of staple foods in many places , along with raising ethical issues , said @entity55 , director of airports and auxiliary services ( @entity57 ) , the @entity18 government agency that oversaw the biofuel flights			1
so in 2007 , @entity4 , along with 14 other member countries of the @entity61 , committed to developing new strategies for second - generation biofuels that would not affect food production			1
" we returned to @entity4 with a mission , " @entity65 told @entity0			2
@entity65 's agency teamed up with the state of @entity70 , where gov. @entity71 had already made a name for himself pushing his state toward alternative fuels			0
@entity70 began cultivating jatropha , whose seeds contain oil that can be extracted and converted into biofuel			0
the state already uses a jatropha biofuel mix on its buses and trucks , and president @entity83 was on hand in november of last year to inaugurate a biodiesal plant there			2
@entity57 partnered with @entity88 company @entity87 , which refined the @entity70 jatropha into jet fuel			0
when the standards for biofuel use in commercial flights was approved july 1 , @entity4 was ready to make the domestic @entity19 and international @entity2 flights a possibility			1
the goal of @entity57 , which provides almost 100 % of the jet fuel in @entity4 , is to commercialize and distribute biofuels , @entity65 said			1
" we 've been working on this project as part of a global effort to combat climate change , " he said			0
by 2015 , the goal is to have 1 % of all jet fuel in @entity4 be biofuel , and by 2020 , 15 % , he said			1
" this is a huge goal , " @entity65 said			0
" one percent does n't sound like a lot , but it equals more than 40 million liters ( 10.6 million gallons )			0
" @entity4 has several things in its favor to become a leader in biofuels , he said			1
it has plenty of land not being used for food , it has a high demand for energy , and it is located next door to the energy - hungry @entity88			0
" @entity4 has made the very important first step to be in a very priviledged place , " @entity65 said			2
halfway across the world , researchers at @entity123 recently published a study extolling the benefits that ethanol derived from agave			0
agave can grow in arid land , and produces less than half of the carbon dioxide emissions produced by corn - based ethanol , @entity128 , one of the study 's authors , told @entity0			2
sugar - based ethanol produces even less emissions , but it needs arable land for cultivation			0
" we need every space we can get , every arable land , for food , " @entity128 said			0
" we think agave may be one part of the solution			0
" for their study , the researchers did a life - cycle analysis for the production of ethanol based on a hypothetical plant in @entity151 , @entity4 , where 90 % of tequila is produced			1
potentially , agave plantations could boost local economies and create jobs , @entity128 said			0
@entity4 , the native home of agave plants , stands to benefit if such an ethanol industry takes off			1
food prices would be spared , but would drinkers have to pay more for their margaritas and tequila shots ? the tequila business is very small compared to the fuel business , and is also more expensive than fuel ethanol , so @entity128 predicts that alcohol prices would remain stable			0
and unlike tequila , which requires the harvesting of the agave stem only , ethanol production would also require harvesting the leaves of the plant			2
" our study backs up that this is a good idea from an environmental perspective , " he said			0
the catch , for now , is that neither jatropha or agave biofuel production is cost - effective			2
but technological advances and oil prices make such alternatives more desirable			0
when that tipping point comes , @entity4 will be ready , the experts said			0
but @entity185 , ceo of @entity187 - based @entity186 and part owner of a @entity18 - based biodiesel company , told @entity0 that @entity4 is still far from being an ideal place to produce biofuels			2
" @entity4 is absolutely a perfect country for biodiesel , especially if it can be domestically grown , " he said , but the country 's ejido system -- collectively - held land in rural areas -- creates hurdles for private investment			1
the result is difficulty in finding continuous large areas of rural land that can be negotiated for use for cultivation , or high prices that make it cost prohibitive			0
without land reform , issues with land availability will continue , and @entity4 will fall a decade or more behind other countries in the biofuels sector , @entity207 said			1
the demand is there , the land is there , but there is no way to get it , he said			0
" now is the time for @entity4 to get its act together for biofuels , " he said .			2

@entity4 has quietly positioned itself as a potential biofuels leader
it oversaw the first transatlantic commercial flight using biofuel
the agave plant also has potential for the country
without land reform , private investment in sector is tough
