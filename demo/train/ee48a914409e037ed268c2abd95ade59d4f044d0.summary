-- for the first time since the @entity3 formed nearly 50 years ago , @entity1 is part of a new band : @entity6 -- featuring @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity11 film composer @entity10			1
the band has quietly been recording together over the past 18 months , with their debut lp planned for sometime around september			0
" it 's different from anything else i 've ever been involved in , " @entity1 tells @entity0			1
" the music is very wide - ranging -- from reggae to ballads to @entity11 songs in @entity19			0
" choose @entity0 's cover : the @entity21 vs. @entity22			2
vote now ! the group got its start two years ago when @entity7 called @entity1 from his home in @entity26			1
" i live in @entity27 right above @entity28 , " says @entity7			1
" it 's kind of the jungle , and sometimes i 'd hear three sound systems all playing different things			2
i always love that , along with @entity11 orchestras			0
i said to @entity1 , ' how could we make a fusion ? ' we were talking about an experiment , and then we started talking about voices			1
it was all born from that conversation			0
" @entity1 loved the idea , and after lots of brainstorming and phone calls around the world , they settled on @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity9 - whose rhythm section helped flesh out the band			1
" we wanted a convergence of different musical styles , " says @entity1			1
" we were always overlapping styles , but they were nevertheless separate			0
" about 18 months ago , the band gathered in a @entity55 studio			2
none of them had prepared any music			0
" we did n't know what the hell we were doing , " says @entity7			1
" we were just jamming and making a noise			0
it was like when a band first starts up in your garage			0
sometimes @entity66 would kick it off and then @entity8 would sing something on top of it			1
we might have a 22 minute jam , and it would become a six minute song			0
" photos : rare and @entity74 the loose method was inspiring for @entity1			1
" one of the beauties is that , just speaking as a vocalist , i did other things , " @entity1 says			1
" i played guitar and harmonica , but there 's four vocalist on the album			2
not everything was reliant on me			0
" the band 's name came from some improvised vocals by @entity9			1
" he was just singing ' @entity6 , heavy , heavy , heavy , super heavy , ' " says @entity7			1
" we thought that sounded good and it sort of stuck with us			0
" @entity1 is confident that @entity3 fans will embrace the group			1
" it is a different kind of record that what people would expect , " he says			0
" it 's not all weird and strange though			2
i think @entity3 fans will think it 's a bit odd , but they 'll find most of it accessible			1
they 've heard me play harmonica before and a lot of it is pretty high energy			0
" photo gallery : the @entity107 , 1964 - 2007 as of now , there are no plans to bring @entity6 on the road			1
" we 're experimenting at the moment and just taking it day by day , " says @entity7			2
" i think if we 're rehearsing and it sounds great and people love the idea then nobody would rule out the possibility of it			0
" might @entity1 's other group be hitting the road at some point in the future ? in an interview with @entity126 , @entity124 said he was optimistic			1
" something 's blowing in the wind , " he said			2
" the idea 's there			2
we kind of know we should do it , but nobody 's put their finger on the moment yet			2
this is what we want to ask each other : do we want to go out in a blaze of glory ? we can , if @entity1 and @entity141 feel like i do , that we can still turn people on			2
we do n't have to prove nothing anymore			0
i just love playing , and i miss the crowd			0
" when asked if the @entity3 are going to tour next year , @entity1 just chuckles			1
" i do n't have any announcement to make at the moment , " he says			0
" i 'm just , uh , ya know ... just doing this right now			0
