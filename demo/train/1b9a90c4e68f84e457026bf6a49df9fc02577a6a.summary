-- better late than never			0
@entity1 , the man who once wore the blue of @entity3 , struck an 89th minute winner as @entity5 claimed a dramatic 1 - 0 victory in its opening game of the @entity8			1
it was a goal which had seldom looked like coming given @entity5 's profligacy in front of goal and the inspired performance of @entity14 , the @entity3 goalkeeper			1
for 88 minutes , @entity5 , champion in 2013 , laid siege to the @entity3 goal with @entity14 producing save after save to thwart the @entity19 side			1
and then , with 89 minutes on the clock , @entity5 finally made the breakthrough courtesy of @entity1			1
@entity3 , so disciplined in defense and having worked tirelessly throughout , failed to clear its lines and when the ball dropped to @entity1 , the defender unleashed an unstoppable effort which brushed off the back of @entity28 and flew into the top corner			1
it was harsh on a @entity3 side , which although rarely looked like winning the contest , played with a determination and tenacity which almost earned it a point			2
for all the hype surrounding the fixture , this game failed to catch light with both teams struggling to produce their best form			0
@entity5 , which was beaten on home turf by @entity3 in the group stage last season , wasted a number of opportunities to win the tie on a frustrating night at the @entity48			1
but @entity1 's late strike provided welcome relief and left @entity3 's players crushed			1
" we fought hard all night against a good team , " @entity14 told @entity52			0
" you know what you get when you come here			0
" a nasty deflection at the end has done us and @entity1 comes back to haunt us			2
" it would have been well deserved draw , we made them work hard for everything			0
" @entity3 will now hope to record successes against @entity66 side @entity65 and @entity68 club @entity67 if it is to have any chance of qualifying for the last - 16			2
@entity71 's side is more than capable of progressing to the next round and while defeat will be hard to take , it showed more than enough to suggest it can still enjoy success in this competition			0
last season , @entity3 endured a disastrous opening 12 minutes at the @entity48 in which it conceded twice and threatened to implode			2
that it did not spoke volumes for the resilience and character of @entity71 's players , who staged a sublime fightback to claim an unlikely 3 - 2 victory			0
on this occasion , it was indebted to its goalkeeper , @entity14 , who produced a series of outstanding saves to keep @entity5 on bay			2
having already squandered a fine opportunity within the opening minute after @entity92 failed to convert from close range , @entity5 was frustrated further by @entity14			2
the @entity95 international produced a remarkable stop to deny @entity92 after the @entity5 man 's thumping header appeared certain to find the net			0
@entity14 was then called upon once again to push deal with @entity28 's deflected effort as the home side exerted its dominance			0
@entity3 , which has failed to win either of its previous two @entity105 games , was beginning to creak under the pressure and @entity14 was forced to palm away @entity108 's fierce drive			0
@entity5 , which was humiliated on its last @entity8 appearance by eventual winner @entity110 last season , continued to dominate the tie			2
@entity113 , an off - season signing from rival @entity115 , was next to go close , running in behind the defense before dragging his effort wide from a tight angle			0
@entity5 , without the injured @entity119 , continued to pressurize @entity3 after the interval but struggled to create a clear opportunity			1
and when it did , with 20 minutes remaining , @entity14 was in the right place at the right time to thwart @entity92 from close range			0
@entity3 , which had rarely looked like threatening , might have stolen victory late on had the referee awarded a penalty when @entity128 appeared to foul @entity129			0
but @entity5 survived and only another wonderful save by @entity14 prevented @entity1 's rasping effort from nestling in the far corner			1
that save appeared to have ensured @entity3 would escape with a point as the clock ticked down			0
but there was still one more twist in the tale and when @entity3 failed to clear @entity140 's cross , @entity1 struck a powerful effort which took the faintest of deflections off @entity28 's back and flew past @entity14			1
@entity1 , who spent one season at @entity3 before moving to @entity146 in 2011 , wheeled away down the touchline to celebrate with his manager , @entity148			1
@entity149 , so often @entity3 's savior , almost carved out a late equalizer at the death but he struck his effort wide of the post after running through on goal			0
in the group 's other game , @entity65 , which takes on @entity3 next , thrashed @entity67 5 - 1			1
elsewhere , @entity158 gained a 1 - 0 win over @entity162 minnow @entity160 , @entity157 was held 1 - 1 by @entity163 and @entity164 recorded a 1 - 1 draw with @entity166			1
@entity167 was the big winner of the night in @entity169 with a 6 - 0 victory over @entity171 .			1
