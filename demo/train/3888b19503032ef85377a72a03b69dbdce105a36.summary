" every nation has a responsibility to make their own decisions , and we respect that of any nation , " he told journalists in @entity11 , the @entity12			0
in spite of the @entity7 decision , it remains the goal of the @entity24 administration that any decision be " an international collaboration , " he said			2
[ @entity28 story , posted at 10:36 p.m. thursday ] ( @entity0 ) the @entity4 may have to take action against @entity9 without the support of one of its staunchest allies , @entity4 officials said thursday after @entity7 lawmakers voted down a proposal for military action			1
@entity37 will continue to consult with @entity7 , but " president @entity24 's decision - making will be guided by what is in the best interests of the @entity4 , " @entity39 spokeswoman @entity38 said in a statement issued thursday evening			1
the reaction followed news the @entity46 rebuffed prime minister @entity48 's call for a strong response to claims @entity9 used chemical weapons against its own people , raising questions about what , if any , timeline the @entity4 may follow for a possible strike			1
@entity24 has not spelled out what steps the @entity4 will take in response to last week 's reported attack against civilians in a @entity61 suburb , allegedly leaving hundreds dead			1
" he believes that there are core interests at stake for the @entity4 and that countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable , " @entity38 said			1
unilateral action was " a possibility " following the results of the late - night @entity73 vote in @entity74 , a senior @entity4 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity0			2
" we care what they think			0
but we 're going to make the decision we need to make , " the official said			0
the vote among @entity7 lawmakers came after a long day of debate , and it appeared to catch @entity48 and his supporters by surprise			2
for days , the prime minister has been sounding a call for action , lending support to talk of a @entity4 - or @entity95 - led strike against @entity9			1
" i strongly believe in the need for a tough response to the use of chemical weapons , but i also believe in respecting the will of this @entity46 , " the prime minister said			1
" i get that and the government will act accordingly , " he said			0
the head of the opposition @entity104 , @entity103 , called @entity48 's call for action " cavalier and reckless			0
" " i think today the @entity46 spoke for the @entity7 people who said they did n't want a rush to war , and i was determined we learned the lessons of @entity114 and i 'm glad we 've made the prime minister see sense this evening , " he told @entity108			2
@entity117 : @entity4 military action in @entity9 would spark ' disaster ' at the @entity122 , a closed - door @entity39 meeting ended with no agreement on a resolution to address the growing crisis in @entity9 , a @entity95 diplomat told @entity0 's @entity126 on condition of anonymity			1
" it was clear there was no meeting of minds , and no agreement on the text			0
it is clear that our approaches are very different and we are taking stock ( of the next steps ) , " the diplomat said of the session , which was called by @entity9 's longtime ally , @entity137			1
the members of the @entity39 expect @entity122 weapons inspectors to brief @entity145 ban ki - moon shortly after they depart @entity9 on saturday			2
@entity145 , in turn , will swiftly brief the @entity39 on the findings , the diplomat said			0
@entity148 , which along with @entity137 has staunchly opposed any military intervention in @entity9 , called for @entity122 weapons inspectors to be allowed to complete their investigation			1
" @entity148 calls on parties concerned to exercise restraints and calmness , adhering to the right track of political solution , " foreign minister @entity153 said in a statement			0
@entity7 's @entity160 has concluded it was " highly likely " that @entity9 government forces used poison gas outside @entity61 last week in an attack that killed at least 350 people , according to a summary of the committee 's findings released thursday			1
speaking in the @entity46 before the vote , @entity48 said failure to respond would undo " decades of painstaking work " to prevent such weapons from being unleashed			2
" the global consensus against the use of chemical weapons will be fatally unraveled , " he said			1
" a 100 - year taboo will have been breached			0
" in @entity37 , @entity177 spokesman @entity176 said @entity24 was still weighing a potential response , but said his administration was working on a " compressed timeline			2
" why @entity137 , @entity117 and @entity148 are standing by @entity181 @entity122 weapons inspectors are now in @entity9 trying to confirm the use of chemical weapons			1
the inspectors are expected to leave the country by saturday morning , @entity145 ban ki - moon said			0
@entity9 president @entity181 's government denies using the weapons against opposition forces and says its troops were the victims , not perpetrators , of recent gas attacks ; but both @entity7 and @entity4 officials say the rebels have no capability to use poison gas on the scale of the august 21 attack near @entity61 , which opposition sources said killed more than 1,300			1
" there is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of @entity206 by the opposition , " @entity7 's @entity160 concluded in a document released thursday			2
" the @entity160 has therefore concluded that there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility			0
" chemical weapons in @entity9 : how did we get here ? @entity48 said the debate was not about regime change or invasion			1
and he said his government would not act without first hearing from the @entity122 inspectors , giving the world body a chance to weigh in and giving @entity73 another chance to vote			0
but the prime minister said failing to act would give @entity181 the unmistakable signal that he could use poison gas " with impunity			0
" the @entity7 dossier on @entity9 also concluded the government had used chemical weapons on 14 previous occasions , and @entity48 said @entity181 stepped up their use last week as a sort of test for the world			1
the government said it could justify the use of force against @entity9 on humanitarian grounds , to stop the suffering , even if the @entity122 declined to authorize a strike			2
" the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons , " the government said			1
@entity7 @entity246 's legal position on @entity9 regime 's chemical weapon use @entity9 's government offered its own arguments against such an intervention			1
in an open letter to @entity7 lawmakers , the speaker of @entity9 's parliament riffed on @entity7 literary hero @entity256 , saying : " if you bomb us , shall we not bleed ? " but in a veiled warning to the @entity7 , the letter also invoked @entity114 , a conflict justified on the grounds that @entity114 had amassed stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and was working toward a nuclear bomb -- claims that were discovered to have been false after the 2003 invasion			1
" those who want to send others to fight will talk in the commons of the casualties in the @entity9 conflict			2
but before you rush over the cliffs of war , would it not be wise to pause ? remember the thousands of @entity7 soldiers killed and maimed in @entity278 and @entity114 , not to mention the hundreds of thousands of @entity114 dead , both in the war and in the continuing chaos			1
" @entity7 commons speaker @entity282 published the letter			0
and @entity181 has vowed to defend his country against any outside attack			0
" the threats of launching an aggression against @entity9 will increase its commitments to its rooted principles and its independent decision that originated from the will of its people , and @entity9 will defend itself against any aggression , " the @entity9 president said thursday in a speech to @entity289 politicians			0
@entity9 : who wants what after chemical weapons horror @entity24 faces calls for @entity4 vote on force across the @entity304 , @entity24 said in a televised interview wednesday that he has no doubt @entity9 used chemical weapons on its own people			1
he said government claims that the opposition used them were impossible			0
" we do not believe that , given the delivery systems , using rockets , that the opposition could have carried out these attacks			0
we have concluded that the @entity9 government in fact carried these out			0
and if that 's so , then there need to be international consequences , " he said on " @entity320 " wednesday			0
@entity24 said that he has not made a decision about whether to conduct a military strike in @entity9			1
a senior administration official said the @entity4 would continue to consult with @entity7 officials , but declined to say if the slowdown in @entity74 would affect @entity4 decision - making on @entity9			1
the president is facing doubts at home as well : more than 160 members of @entity334 , including 63 democrats , have now signed letters calling for either a vote or at least a " full debate " before any @entity4 action			2
@entity340 : 5 reasons @entity4 must intervene in @entity9 the author of one of those letters , @entity344 rep. @entity342 of @entity345 , said @entity24 should seek " an affirmative decision of @entity334 " before committing @entity4 forces			2
