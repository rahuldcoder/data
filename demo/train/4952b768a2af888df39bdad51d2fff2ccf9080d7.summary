-- a 62 - year - old man man was arrested early thursday and faces criminal mischief charges for allegedly applying a herbicide commonly used to kill trees and brush to landmark 130 - year - old live oaks on the edge of the @entity10 campus in east - central @entity11 , police said			1
@entity13 was taken into custody at the @entity15 , police chief @entity12 told reporters			1
@entity13 was being held on a felony first - degree criminal mischief charge on $ 50,000 bond , said maj. @entity20 of the @entity21			1
a preliminary hearing has not been scheduled			2
@entity12 released few details , saying he did not want to jeopardize the investigation			2
he said he believes @entity13 acted alone and he does not anticipate further arrests , although he said additional charges may be filed			1
the poisonings -- which came to light after a man called a @entity31 , @entity11 , radio show and said he had poisoned the trees -- came as a heartbreaking shock to @entity10 fans			1
for generations , they have thronged to the trees at @entity39 's corner , at the edge of campus , after victories to " roll " the trees with toilet paper			1
the latest significant celebration was after the @entity46 defeated @entity47 for the national football championship on january 10			2
@entity39 's corner is named after a historic drugstore at the opposite corner of the intersection			2
a man identifying himself as " @entity53 " called " the @entity54 " on january 27 and said , " let me tell you what i did the weekend after the @entity57 ( the annual @entity10 - @entity59 game )			2
i went to @entity10 , @entity11 , because i live 30 miles away			2
and i poisoned the two @entity39 's trees			1
" " they 're not dead yet , but they definitely will die , " the caller said , adding he did n't care if his actions were against the law			2
" @entity11 " ended his call with " @entity67 " -- a variation of the @entity11 's " @entity69 " rallying cry			1
@entity10 defeated @entity59 28 - 27 in @entity71 on november 26 , 2010			0
" @entity11 " mentioned a jersey with @entity10 quarterback @entity74 's number placed on the statue of former @entity11 coach @entity76 at the time of the 2010 game			0
he also claimed he had a newspaper article showing @entity10 students rolling @entity39 's corner after @entity76 's death in january 1983			0
@entity83 told @entity0 thursday that he 's never heard of the @entity76 death story			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity85 said " by all accounts it did not happen			0
" asked why " @entity11 " might have called the show , @entity83 said that " he was boastful			1
i do n't think he cared			0
" over the years , the host has gotten many calls about football and rivalries , but " this is the low point , " @entity83 said			1
" most people are horrified by it , but some people are n't losing any sleep , " he said of the incident			0
@entity99 , who screens calls for @entity83 , said the caller initially told him he was an @entity59 fan and wanted to discuss the rivalry			0
but the caller then told him in detail about the poisoning			0
" we deal with some crazy people , but when he mentioned the chemical and how he had done it , it was alarming to me , " @entity99 said			0
@entity83 's program is a regionally syndicated sports talk show			1
@entity13 's full name is @entity114 , @entity0 affiliate @entity115 reported			1
he made his first court appearance thursday			1
the caller said he had used @entity119 , which was found when the soil was tested after the university learned of the radio show call			1
thirty - three soil samples were taken the next day and were sent for testing			0
the expedited , final results that came back february 11 showed the levels of @entity119 are " very lethal , " according to the school			0
the substance has never been used at @entity10 , horticulture professor @entity128 told reporters thursday			1
the substance is manufactured by @entity132			0
a representative from @entity132 is advising the university on removal procedures , and expert horticulturalists also are being consulted , according to @entity10			1
@entity10 spokeswoman @entity137 said thursday that the university " was taking a great deal of action " in the days after receiving the results , but delayed making a public announcement because of the police investigation			1
the university said in a statement released wednesday the trees had been poisoned			1
asked thursday whether the trees will die , @entity147 , assistant professor of agronomy and soils at @entity10 , grew emotional			1
" i always want to hold out hope , " he said , but the concentration of the herbicide translates into " a very low probability " of survival			1
he said it was unclear how long the trees could last before dying			2
experts were re-evaluating soil samples and have applied liquid activated charcoal that can bind with the herbicide and inactivate it			0
they will also study whether an " excavator vacuum " can be used to take out some of the soil , @entity128 said			0
offers of help have poured in from across the nation , from tree farmers , experts and others , officials said			0
a license is not required to purchase @entity174 in @entity11 , but " it 's not widely available , " @entity147 said , and " it 's not extremely cheap			0
" it is usually used to control vegetation on right of ways or along fence rows or to maintain bare ground near some industrial facilities , @entity147 said			0
" it 's very effective at what it does , and that is to kill most plants			0
" the herbicide could spread through the soil and affect other nearby plants , including a white oak and magnolia trees , @entity128 said			2
@entity194 , with the university 's @entity195 and @entity197 , said there is " very little chance " it will affect groundwater for drinking water purposes			0
university president @entity203 and @entity204 told @entity10 fans to act with class			0
" this is the exception rather than the rule , " @entity12 said thursday			2
" this is a person who obviously has problems , to do something like this , so we want to use caution and let the justice system take its course			0
" @entity0 's @entity218 and @entity219 contributed to this report .			0
