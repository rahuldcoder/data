-- when @entity2 retired from the @entity4 @entity3 in june 1991 , a reporter asked him what were the medical reasons that contributed to his leaving the bench -- and its lifetime appointment -- after serving for nearly 25 years			1
he was his usual blunt self			0
" what 's wrong with me ? " @entity2 said at the packed news conference			2
i 'm getting old and falling apart			0
" when the news broke this week that @entity15 @entity14 was stepping down as the spiritual leader of 1.2 billion @entity17 because of his concerns about being able to do the job , many began to speculate that there were other reasons for the decision			1
we have become accustomed to a pope dying in office			2
that 's not a surprise			2
it has been nearly 600 years since the last pope , @entity29 , quit in 1415			2
even though the job of pope is a lifetime appointment , frankly , it is selfish of any individual to hold on to the job for dear life , knowing full well they do n't have the capacity to do the job			2
" strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me , " according to a statement from @entity14 released by the @entity49			1
whether we want to be honest or not , it was sad to watch the decline of pope @entity53 he was a vibrant figure when he became pope in 1978 , traveling the world and spreading the gospel to anyone who would listen			1
but toward the end of his life in 2005 , he was barely able to move or talk , clearly worn down by significant health challenges			0
any leader who respects the organization they serve should have the common sense to know when it 's time to say goodbye			1
we 've seen countless examples of @entity69 , pastors , politicians and others hang on and on to a position of power , hurting the very people they were elected or chosen to serve			1
it takes considerable courage for anyone to step away from the power bestowed upon them by a position , as well as the trappings that come with it			1
i 'll leave it to others to try to figure out other reasons behind the resignation			0
but we should at least acknowledge the value of an ego-less decision that reflects humility and concern about the very institution the pope pledged his life to			1
all leaders should be concerned about their institution continuing to grow and thrive once their days are no more			0
that 's why a proper succession plan is vitally important			0
too often we have assessed great leaders by what they did in their positions			0
but their final legacy really is defined by how they left a place			0
pope @entity14 knows full well the @entity17 can not grow and prosper if its leader is limited in traveling and attending to his flock			1
there comes a time when one chapter must end and another begins			0
he has more days behind him than in front of him			0
he should enjoy his last years in peace and tranquility , without having to worry about trying to do the work designed for a younger man			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .			1

pope @entity14 stuns world by *announcing* he will resign
@entity121 says it 's a wise decision for a leader to step down when his powers fail
he says a mark of a good leader is the care he takes about the institution he is leaving
@entity121 : too many in power try to hang on after they are no *longer* capable
