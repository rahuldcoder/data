editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " voting rights -- and wrongs : the @entity6 , " published last month by @entity5			1
she is the vice-chairwoman of the @entity8 and an adjunct scholar at the @entity5			2
her writing can be found at @entity11 /			2
@entity2 says an impressive biography is n't a qualification for the @entity14			1
( @entity15 ) -- judge @entity16 is all but certain to be confirmed as an associate justice on the @entity14			1
it is close to unimaginable that the @entity19 will peel off enough @entity21 votes to stop @entity23 confirmation			1
she 's a first : a @entity25			1
and she has an impressive life history : raised in a housing project by a single mother , she went to @entity29 and then to @entity30			1
it 's a classic @entity32 overcoming - the - odds story , but , while admirable , it is not a qualification for the highest court in the land			1
@entity21 themselves have often implicitly made the same point -- about other minority appointees , in fact			1
they never saw the much humbler origins of justice @entity44 as an argument for his elevation to the @entity14			0
and they used a filibuster to stop @entity50 appointee @entity49 from getting a seat on the @entity52 , which they feared would be a springboard to the @entity14			0
@entity49 is a @entity55 who arrived in @entity32 at age 17 with only limited command of @entity59 ; he was also raised by a single mother and made it to @entity62 , where he was editor of the law review			2
supporters of @entity16 argue that she will add needed " diversity " to the @entity14			1
yet , with her confirmation , there will be six @entity68 , two jews and one @entity70			0
for many @entity32 , religious affiliation is more important in defining an individual than race or ethnicity			0
but no one is complaining about " too many " @entity68 or @entity69 -- thankfully			0
@entity32 is supposed to be a land in which individuals are seen as ... individuals			0
too many , too few : that is the language of un-american quotas			0
@entity16 has suggested that race and ethnicity , to a substantial degree , define individuals			1
" whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging , " she said in a 2001 speech			0
at her confirmation hearings , she will undoubtedly dance away from such ethnic determinism			0
but it would appear to be what she believes , since she has reiterated the point several times in different venues			0
her supporters also emphasize the " empathy " she would bring to the court			2
it is a quality the president promised he would look for in making court appointments			0
in a july 2007 campaign speech , he said , " we need somebody who 's got the heart -- the empathy -- to recognize what it 's like to be a young teenage mom			1
the empathy to understand what it 's like to be poor or african - american or gay or disabled or old , and that 's the criteria by which i 'll be selecting my judges			1
" evidently , however , not all impoverished backgrounds leave you empathetic			0
the proof is in the pudding , and the pudding appears to be party membership			0
by definition , conservatives are assumed to lack empathy			2
as @entity134 professor @entity133 has argued , " @entity130 is at the heart of progressive thought			0
... progressives care about others as well as themselves			0
" and , by implication , conservatives do n't			2
empathy has thus become a code word for progressive politics -- the likelihood that , as a justice , the nominee will take politically liberal positions			1
public policy preferences driving @entity14 decisions ? what a shock			0
some justices have much more respect for the law than others , but if the opinions were not often judgments driven by political values as well , they would be less predictable			2
most court - watchers thought ( correctly , as it turned out ) that the recent @entity160 firefighters ' case would come down four - four , with only justice @entity162 's vote hard to call			2
the results of an exam for promotion within the @entity160 fire department had been thrown out because , with one exception , all of the successful candidates were white -- the " wrong " color , according to the reasoning of the city and @entity16			1
one can argue that race discrimination decisions do not involve ideology and are based on strictly legal grounds , but if so , it is passing strange that in busing , affirmative action and other race - related cases , even before the oral argument is heard we almost always know which justices will take what positions			0
liberals still support busing , for instance ; conservatives oppose it			0
@entity16 will replace another reliable liberal , justice @entity189 , and so the ideological balance on the court will not change			1
and yet , perhaps as a consequence of her implicit embrace of quotas and identity politics , she has come to the @entity23 hearings with public support that is unusually low ; only 47 percent of @entity32 say they want her confirmed , a recent @entity15 poll found			2
nevertheless , @entity19 are likely to tread softly in the hearings			1
race - related issues make them nervous , and @entity201 are a fast - growing group with increasing political clout , especially in such swing states as @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			0
barring the totally unexpected , @entity16 's confirmation will thus be a cakewalk			1
let us hope that the public 's pessimism proves to be misguided and she turns out to be a lawyer 's lawyer and not an ethnic activist who tends to let the usual political definition of " empathy " drive her opinions			1
there is reason to worry : she will have lifetime tenure on an institution with enormous power			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity16 's life story is a *compelling* one
she says @entity21 have n't honored such humble beginnings in @entity19 nominees
she says @entity16 's " empathy " may be code word for one brand of politics
@entity2 : i *'m* concerned that judge may have more *fidelity* to activism than to law
