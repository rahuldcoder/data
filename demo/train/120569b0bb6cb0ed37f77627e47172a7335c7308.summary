@entity0 -- parents who say that a range of preventive vaccines given their young children can cause serious health problems will have their appeal heard by the @entity9 @entity8			2
the justices monday agreed to decide whether drug makers can be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by @entity13 in 1986 to address specific claims about safety			2
the so - called vaccine court has handled such disputes and was designed to ensure a reliable , steady supply of the drugs by reducing the threat of lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms			2
the questions in the latest case are whether such liability claims can proceed , if the vaccine - related injuries could have been avoided by better product design , and if federal officials had approved another , allegedly safer drug			1
oral arguments in the dispute will be held in the fall			1
the lawsuit was brought by the parents of @entity37 , a girl from the @entity39 , @entity40 , area			1
they said she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of @entity47 shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria , pertussis ( whooping cough ) and tetanus			1
after the third series , according to court briefs , the child began having seizures and became disabled			1
now a teenager , @entity37 continues to suffer what is described as " residual seizure disorder			0
" the @entity61 alleged @entity62 failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine			1
the vaccine court rejected the initial claim , so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in the federal courts			1
their lawyers said the 24 - year - old law does not ban all lawsuits , especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable			0
a federal appeals court eventually ruled for @entity77 , now owned by @entity78 , concluding that all design - defect claims were barred under statute			2
despite that victory , the company urged the high court to hear the case , saying it seeks final resolution on broader legal questions			1
the @entity88 administration also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question			1
@entity77 and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe , but side effects can occur in very rare cases			0
they also say that the vaccine industry is generally not profitable , but that the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business			0
for that , they say , legal protection provided by @entity13 is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and affordable			0
the high court did not act immediately on a another related , pending appeal			0
the @entity111 @entity8 last year became the first appeals court in the @entity9 to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court			2
that case involved @entity117 - area parents who said their son @entity118 suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots , by @entity77 and @entity121 , containing the mercury - based preservative thimerosal			1
now 12 , the boy is unable to speak , say his parents , @entity125 and @entity126			0
the preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines			0
despite winning at the state level , the family has since withdrawn its case , but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in @entity111			1
the @entity137 was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply , promote safety and future research , and compensate innocent victims			2
those goals were listed at the time as a " top public health priority			0
" lawmakers acknowledged the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims			1
despite @entity150 approval for the vaccines , companies said they were being driven out of the market			0
the special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield , designed to be a reliable , relatively quick , no - fault solution to various claims			2
unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases			0
the case accepted is @entity37 v. @entity77 ( 09 - 152 )			0
the pending case is @entity77 v. @entity164 ( 08 - 1120 ) .			0

latest case involves liability claim , product design , drug safety questions
suit brought by parents of girl who got @entity47 shots , had seizures , became disabled
parents say drug company did *n't* adequately warn of risks associated with vaccine
