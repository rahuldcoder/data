-- with thursday 's debut of " @entity3 , " @entity1 just might resurrect the live musical broadcast			1
in the 1950s , such productions were big television events , with viewers tuning in to see the likes of @entity9 performing in an enactment of " @entity11 , " which @entity12 aired in 1957			0
yet more than half a century has passed without any major broadcast network daring to mount a full - scale musical on live tv -- until @entity1 decided to embrace the challenge			1
the result is a three - hour primetime production called " @entity3 , " a tv revival of the beloved story that originally graced the stage			1
country megastar @entity23 and @entity24 of " @entity25 " have been cast in the iconic roles of @entity27 and captain @entity28 , and more than 600 kids came out to open casting calls for the @entity28 children			0
the seven that were chosen committed to intense rehearsals that lasted for weeks prior to the massive television event , which airs december 5 at 8/7 @entity35			0
" we 've all worked so hard , we all just want to do the best we can and contribute to this legacy that is ' @entity38 , ' " @entity39 said in @entity1 's behind - the - scenes special , " the making of @entity3 " @entity1 says the production will " retell the story for a whole new generation , " and @entity0 's senior media correspondent @entity40 agrees that it may resonate with younger viewers			1
" even in this age of @entity46 where everything 's available on demand , i would love to know how many people out there have n't ( seen the movie ) , " @entity40 said			2
" i have a feeling those younger people in @entity1 's audience that have n't seen it yet will discover it for the first time			1
" " @entity38 " originally reached @entity58 audiences in 1959 , followed by the popular 1965 film starring @entity9			2
@entity9 recently said on " @entity60 " that she stands behind @entity39 , although she can relate to the mounting pressure			0
" a live broadcast ! my @entity63 , poor lady ! " @entity9 said			2
live television is always a gamble because , simply put , anything can happen			0
" the idea of doing it live is what 's daring about it , " said @entity69 media reporter @entity68			2
" they could have taped another version of this , but doing it live gives it a little frisson of excitement			0
what happens if the thing kind of goes wrong , you know ? now it 's like seeing a @entity58 show , staged , but they 're only doing it once			0
" @entity40 said @entity1 is banking on this element of surprise to bring in the ratings			1
" one of the reasons why viewers will tune in is to see if the microphones work , to see if everybody 's ready , to see if all the sets are functioning , " he said			2
" that kind of curiosity might help @entity1			2
" yet " @entity3 " is up against competitive thursday night programming , and @entity1 's challenge is to get people to tune in as the production unfolds rather than setting dvrs or using @entity104 to watch the special later			1
nonetheless , @entity40 believes it 's probably an experiment worth trying for the @entity1			1
" if it gets a lot of audience , they can go and do this again , " @entity40 said			0
" of course in television , when something does n't seem to succeed , everybody else gets afraid of doing it			0
so the worst scenario here is that it bombs and nobody else tries this again			0
because i have a feeling if you try this a few times , one of them would breakthrough			0
" the @entity128 and ratings numbers will reveal the success of " @entity3 " in the meantime , the cast is relying on the massive scale of production and their six weeks of grinding rehearsals to prepare for thursday 's big show			1
" we all know that coming up is this massive live performance that we can all be terrified about then , " @entity137 said in @entity1 's " the making of @entity138 ! " " our first preview is our press night and our final night ! there is going to be a moment where , you know , once you 've said the lines they 're gone forever			1

@entity1 *faces* a challenge with a live primetime production of " @entity38 "
a major broadcast network has n't attempted a full - scale musical in years
@entity1 's challenge is to get viewers to watch live rather than via dvr or @entity104
the live element of surprise works in the network 's *favor*
