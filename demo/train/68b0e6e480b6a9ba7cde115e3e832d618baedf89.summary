-- in the wake of @entity6 alum @entity5 's surprise hiring as ceo , variations of the same question are popping up again and again : what can be done to turn once - mighty @entity10 around ? in the salad days of the late ' 90s and early 2000s , @entity10 was the very face of the internet for many people			1
its search engine was the @entity16 's most - used , letting the company demand top dollars for advertising			1
as a web portal , it helped hundreds of million of people take their first tentative steps online			0
opinion : what signal is @entity5 giving to @entity10 employees ? but along came a company called @entity6 , whose algorithm - based search feature came to dominate the market quickly and whose e-mail service , while not supplanting @entity10 's , played a part in stripping away the company 's fading sheen of @entity13 chic			1
@entity10 's stock price spiraled to $ 118.75 in early 2000			1
that number sat at $ 15.62 wednesday morning , about three months after the company laid off 2,000 workers			2
the once - dominant photo site , @entity10 - owned @entity41 , has been increasingly shoved aside in favor of mobile apps such as @entity44 and blogging sites such as @entity46			1
and even online advertising , which @entity10 once dominated , is slumping			1
@entity10 's ad revenue has been passed by both @entity6 and @entity49 , and its overall share of online ad sales in the @entity52 has been cut in half since 2009			1
the company has churned through four ceos in four years			2
and the last , @entity57 , left in may after he was discovered to have padded his resume with college credentials he did n't really earn			0
so what 's to be done ? defining @entity10 analysts say the @entity63 , @entity64 , company needs to start by deciding what it is			1
take a quick look at this list of products : @entity70			0
@entity75 ( yes , they have both )			0
@entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
that 's just the tip of the digital iceberg , and does n't even get into @entity10 - owned services such as @entity41 and @entity85			1
oh yes , and @entity10 still has a search engine , too ( although its inner workings have been farmed out to @entity88 )			1
" @entity10 's fundamental problem is that it has too many disparate products with no clear unifying thread that ties them all together , " analyst @entity89 of @entity90 wrote on the company 's blog this week			1
@entity89 , who has followed @entity10 closely , said @entity97 must be open to killing the company 's lesser products as she seeks to move things in the right direction			1
@entity5 : six life lessons from @entity10 ceo according to @entity89 , @entity10 's new chief needs to do three things : define a clear vision for the @entity10 brand , get rid of products that have nothing to do with that vision and then " market the new vision clearly so that business and consumer customers know what @entity10 is and why to use it			1
" and while she lauds @entity97 's experience and knowledge , @entity89 said she is not sure the 37 - year - old is up to the task			2
" @entity97 's background is in product development ... not corporate strategy , not marketing , not brand definition ... the areas where @entity10 has the most critical need , " she wrote in the post , which a @entity90 spokeswoman cited when reached for comment on this story			1
attracting talent @entity132 analyst @entity131 does n't necessarily agree			0
he said innovation is the key for @entity10 , a company that , in the eyes of many , has remained stagnant while rivals better anticipated such digital trends as the growth of social media and mobile networking			1
those competing companies , including @entity6 , have repeatedly disrupted a web landscape that 's dramatically different than when @entity10 ruled			1
" her experience will be valuable there , " @entity143 said			0
" i think the argument can be made that @entity5 probably already knows @entity10 very well			1
she 's probably studied it for some time			0
" he too suggests streamlining , saying that some @entity10 services will need to be " pared down and , ultimately , outsourced or shuttered			2
" the company needs to address the growth of the mobile web , he said , or as @entity89 puts it , develop " a plan for the @entity154			0
" and to innovate truly , @entity143 said @entity97 will need to bring in the sort of people who helped turned @entity6 into a powerhouse			2
popular tech blogger @entity158 agrees			0
he 's bullish on @entity97 as ceo , even though she " does face huge problems at @entity10 , " he wrote on his @entity162 page			1
he said she 's uniquely suited to do what any good leader must do : surround herself with other talented people			0
" that company has been abused by its leaders for so long and has lost so much talent , " he wrote			0
" that said , one thing i watch is who would join a new leader			0
i 've been at several events and have seen first hand the people that @entity5 inspires			2
she 'll probably bring in her own innovation team that will be world class pretty quickly			0
this will be an innovation shock to @entity10 that 's definitely needed			1
" opinion : @entity5 can revive @entity10 , and the web leading with products , not content by selecting @entity97 over interim ceo @entity185 , @entity10 could be tipping its hand as to what users can expect			1
@entity185 's background is in content , such as @entity78 and related offerings such as @entity75 ( formerly @entity75 , a publishing platform that 's been criticized as a low - quality " content farm			0
" ) @entity97 , meanwhile , comes from a product - development background			0
in her 13 years at @entity6 she helped create the look of a number of services , from @entity199 to @entity200			2
the internet just wants @entity97 to fix @entity41 @entity203 co-founder @entity202 , now head of influential venture - capital firm @entity205 , said that could mean @entity10 is ready to focus on innovating and improving products such as @entity70 and @entity71 instead of pumping up web content such as @entity78 ( which is hugely popular but is largely populated by material gleaned from outside news services )			2
" it 's a huge statement on the part of the board that they want the company to be product - led , " @entity211 told @entity212 , a @entity0 content partner			2
" i say that because they had a great ceo ( @entity221 ) if they wanted to be media - led			0
it 's a huge double down on product			0
" @entity202 said he would n't have gone in that product - focused direction , but " i did n't think they could get someone like @entity5			2
" @entity10 will need to figure out how to make users want those products though , according to @entity143			2
tools such as @entity70 and the popular portal page do n't translate well to mobile devices , which are , increasingly , how people access the @entity16			0
but analysts point to some positives on which @entity97 can build			0
while it 's sliding in the @entity52 , @entity70 is still the second-most popular e-mail service in the world ( behind @entity88 's @entity236 ) and a top portal for many			0
the company said 700 million people a month still visit @entity10 sites -- a lot of eyeballs to look at advertising , which both @entity143 and @entity89 see as a logical focus moving forward			1
" its reach and available inventory is massive , " @entity89 wrote last year			0
" and its ad marketplace is making real - time ad buying mainstream			0
