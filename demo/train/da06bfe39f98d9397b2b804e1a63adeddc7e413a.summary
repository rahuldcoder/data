@entity0 , @entity1 -- if anyone can understand what the @entity6 abduction victims must have endured , it 's @entity8			1
like the three women , the 25 - year - old @entity1 spent most of a decade imprisoned in her abductor 's house after being abducted on a @entity0 street in 1998			1
@entity14 kept her locked in his cellar for eight tortuous years			1
he raped her , then committed suicide when she finally escaped seven years ago			1
she said @entity17 , @entity17 and @entity17 should enjoy the feeling of freedom but be careful			0
" it was an enormous feeling of joy that can not be compared to anything else , " she told @entity2			0
" you see all of the possibilities laid out in front of you			0
... " the women in @entity6 should really try to savor this joyous feeling as long as possible , and to avoid letting themselves be pushed back into everyday life too soon			1
" in 1998 , @entity8 , then 10 , was dragged into a car while walking to school			1
she was often locked inside a " hermetically sealed " concrete jail			0
her abductor used restraints on her to keep her in bed with him as he slept			2
she wrote that she was beaten as many as 200 times a week -- until she heard her own spine " snap			0
" she escaped in august 2006 and wrote a book entitled " 3,096 days " about the ordeal			1
the days immediately after her escape were hard			0
" it was a very difficult time to experience for me , the media everywhere , and re-establishing my relationship with my parents again , " she said			0
in many ways the case in @entity6 is a lot like hers , but she was alone , while the three @entity53 women had each other to talk to during their captivity			1
she also never heard her abductor explain why he did it , but she said that was n't as important as knowing he would never be able to harm anyone else			2
she said she was glad the women were still alive			2
" i am very happy for the three women , and thank @entity63 they had survived their ordeal , " she said			2
" they are certainly very strong women			2
" @entity8 said former captives need to take time to work through the emotional issues themselves			1
" do n't let other people take over , " she said , standing outside the home where she was held			2
she owns it now ; it was awarded to her by the @entity1 courts as damages			1
the property is an important symbol , she said , and keeping it is her way of dealing with her past			0
" it 's so very emotional for me because it never stops , " she said			2
" you live with it			0
" the ordeal will be with her for her whole life , she said			0
she tries to see positives in her life and look forward , not back			0
she had to " bury the hate you feel for the person who did this to you , " she said			1
besides assimilating back into normal lives slowly , former captives also have to deal with the people who do n't believe their stories are entirely true			1
she would tell the @entity6 women : " do n't worry what people say			1
they are the ones that experienced it , they are the ones who survived it , and they are the ones who have to come to terms with what they experienced their entire lives			0
" it 's a sobering message for women already scarred by years of terrible conditions			1
their captivity has ended , but their ordeal may be far from over			0
