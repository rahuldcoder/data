-- here 's what @entity0 readers are saying on health stories from the past week : ' it 's horrible what they 've had to endure ' our weekend piece on @entity10 's struggle with a rare disease called epidermolysis bullosa , or @entity13 , and her neighbors ' social media - driven efforts to help raise money for a cure , got nearly 400 comments			1
some discussed efforts by the government and others to help find cures for disease ; others recounted their health struggles or those of people they know			0
" i ca n't say how happy i am to see this on the @entity0 front page , " commenter @entity30 wrote			1
" i have a good friend whose husband and son both have @entity13			0
it 's horrible what they 've had to endure			2
every small milestone is such a huge accomplishment			0
my friend 's son is 5 , and only started walking last year			1
it brought tears to my eyes when she posted a video of him running not long ago			0
it 's been such a long struggle , and one with no foreseeable end			1
i 'm happy to see this on the @entity0 front page , because more people will become aware of @entity13 , which will hopefully drive more ( research and development ) money into finding treatments or a cure ! " ' if you 're just working out and not altering your diet , it 's an uphill battle ' the story on @entity66 , who dropped 107 pounds after realizing her " fat shorts " no longer fit her during her college years , also garnered nearly 400 comments , many of them expressing support for @entity73 and sharing similar weight loss struggles			1
" congrats to @entity66 , " wrote commenter focusmm			1
" i firmly believe in taking personal accountability for your health			0
i lost 65 pounds and went from a size @entity80 to a size 6 last year , cut my body fat in half , lowered my visceral fat from 11 to 4 and got my cholesterol totally in control			2
but my focus was more on the eating aspects and adopting a new way of eating for life			0
i work out , but i think it is an 80/20 rule , where 80 % is all about what you eat			0
i now teach weight loss classes online to pay it forward for the health and renewed energy i have			1
" responding to focusmm , commenter @entity99 wrote , " the best description i 've heard is ' you lose ounces in the gym , but you lose pounds in the kitchen			2
' if you 're just working out and not altering your diet , it 's an uphill battle			2
do both and you can shed weight in no time			2
" ' nothing in medicine is absolute ' a story on the flu vaccine being less effective , especially for the elderly , than previously stated sparked a debate on vaccines in general			1
" the military forces this on the troops ( firsthand experience ) , " wrote commenter tinytall			2
" each year that i got this silly ' vaccination ' while serving , i got the flu			1
since separating ( 1999 ) , i 've never gotten the flu , including this year			1
" in response , commenter @entity126 wrote in part , " that does n't mean the vaccine does n't work , it just means that nothing in medicine is absolute			1
i know someone who did n't smoke , yet got lung cancer , and a couple people who wore their seat belt , yet still died in a car crash			1
that does n't mean that i should take up smoking or stop wearing my seat belt			1
like the flu vaccine , not smoking and wearing a seat belt improve my odds , but are n't guarantees			1
" ' we have more failures by far than successes ' a story on a new breast cancer drug receiving approval from the @entity150 triggered a discussion on the role of the @entity150 in safeguarding public health and on drug prices			2
" you have no idea how much it costs to bring a drug to market , " commenter rs1201 pointed out			0
" as a senior research scientist working in the r&d division of a major pharmaceutical company , i can tell you that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent to come up with a drug			0
we have more failures by far than successes			0
to succeed , the company hires the best of the best scientists and has to pay them accordingly			0
to retain these scientists , the company does everything it can and that costs them dearly			0
it takes approximately 20 years from inception of the idea of a drug to @entity150 approval			0
there 's no guarantee of approval			0
pricing on a drug is a way to recoup a bit of all the millions that it took to get the drug to the @entity150			0

a story on 5 - year - old @entity10 got nearly 400 comments
commenters were supportive of @entity66 's weight loss struggle
one commenter likens the flu vaccine to wearing a seat belt
