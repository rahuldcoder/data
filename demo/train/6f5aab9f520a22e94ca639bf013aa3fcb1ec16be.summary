the pilot managed to regain control and make a " heavy landing , " it said			1
the february 12 incident resulted in no injuries among the passengers or four crew , but triggered an investigation			1
" as he made the flare manoeuvre ... his prosthetic limb became detached from the yoke clamp , depriving him of control of the aircraft , " the report said			2
" he made a rapid assessment of the situation and considered alerting the co-pilot and instructing him to take control			2
" however , it said , because the co-pilot would not have time to take stock of what was happening , he decided the best option was to continue one - handed			0
' safety checks ' " he did this , but with power still applied , and possibly a gust affecting the aircraft , a normal touchdown was followed by a bounce , from which the aircraft landed heavily			2
" the report made no comment on the incident but concluded with the pilot 's own pledge to be " more cautious about checking the attachment on his prosthesis			2
" it said he would also brief his co-pilots about the possibility of a similar event occurring in the future			0
@entity12 , a @entity18 - based low cost airline , said it had carried out its own investigation and had put into place additional safety measures			1
" @entity12 is proud to be an equal opportunities employer , " it said in a statement			0
" this , in common with most airlines , means we do employ staff with reduced physical abilities			0
where appropriate , and in accordance with @entity18 @entity84 requirements , this does include pilots			0
" it said the pilot was a senior captain and one of its " most experienced and trusted " pilots			0
" following the incident , @entity12 immediately undertook a detailed internal investigation from which it determined a series of additional fail - safe safety checks			1
