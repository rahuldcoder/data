-- swimming is almost beside the point at these 15 pools found at gorgeous , unexpected properties around the world			1
hotel : @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 why it 's cool : the guest - only infinity pool at this five - month - old property is lined with black quartz tiles , a stroke of genius on the part of @entity7 's upscale @entity18 chocolatier owners ; the resulting dark color reflects the iconic pitons and surrounding rain forest like an overflowing mirror			1
ten lounge chairs line the poolside pine deck , pretty much assuring time by the pool for every guest of the 14 cottages and cabins			0
from your lounge , you can request poolside service of chocolaty treats , like a @entity34 infused with fresh cacao pulp from the company 's nearby groves			0
@entity0 : see 24 more photos of these amazing pools hotel : @entity41 at @entity42 , @entity43 why it 's cool : spectacular pools are a dime a dozen in @entity42 , the southwestern shore of @entity41 with prime beach real estate , known for glamorous resorts			1
so it 's saying something that the @entity53 has one that really stands out			0
the $ 9 million infinity - edge pool , which opened in july 2009 , seems to roll out into @entity55 53 feet below , while underwater speakers play contemporary @entity58 tunes			2
open only to guests who are 21 plus , this 120 - foot - long saltwater pool has four inlets that perpetually bubble , and its swim - up bar delivers thirst - quenching treats like vodka mojitos			1
in the early evening , the glass mosaic tiles on the bottom of the pool glitter in the flames cast by surrounding fire bowls and tiki torches			0
hotel : hotel du @entity73 , @entity75 , @entity76 why it 's cool : when this hotel reopened in april 2011 on the @entity79 after a $ 64 million renovation , it unveiled a new , guest - only outdoor pool , which had been dynamited out of the adjacent cliff face			1
from their perch here , 13 feet above the @entity85 , guests swim in seawater heated to a temperate 82 ° f , and have a perfect view over the infinity edge of fellow visitors tying their yachts off on the hotel 's private landing stage			2
if for some reason one tires of ordering poolside cocktails from the two roving attendants , a nearby set of trapezes hangs over the sea ( near the ocean - diving boards , of course ) for an adventurous dip in the @entity85 @entity0 : 10 gorgeous pools you wo n't believe are public hotel : @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 why it 's cool : @entity108 , in @entity112 , means " peaceful mountain " -- and the most peaceful of those found here may be the 80 - foot - high , @entity116 - period sandstone escarpment that rises from the middle of the resort 's u-shaped pool			1
guests can take in panoramic views of @entity110 's dramatic mesas from either the 84 - degree water or one of the surrounding lounges and king - size daybeds			2
order a prickly - pear margarita to enhance the desert flavor during the day , or test the tranquil waters anytime of night you please : the pool is open 24 hours			0
hotel : @entity135 , @entity136 why it 's cool : no , it 's not a mirage			0
the @entity141 resort , which opened in november 2009 , materializes in the middle of the tall , curling dunes of the @entity144			0
it 's a spectacular backdrop for the resort 's amoeba - shaped pool that rivals a football field in sheer size			1
guests often stand in the shallow end of the curvy oasis , next to the bar , and observe the pool butlers bringing cold towels , iced fruit popsicles , and other treats to sun - worshippers on the 140 chaise lounges that line the sandstone patio			1
during the day , the pool is kept at a refreshing 70 ° @entity163 until 9 p.m. , when lights glimmer along the pool 's edges and the stars come out over the date - palm trees			1
hotel : @entity170 why it 's cool : sure , @entity172 took a dip here in " @entity175 , " but it 's the view from this sleek , 47th - floor swimming pool that 's truly remarkable : floor - to - ceiling windows frame jaw - dropping vistas of @entity170 , and even venerable @entity179 , while the steel - and - glass pyramid - shaped ceiling floods the pool with natural light			1
the 65 - foot - long , four - lane pool is striking at night , too , when the city 's skyscrapers light up			1
@entity0 : 12 restaurants with spectacular views hotel : @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 why it 's cool : you can take small sailboats out on this saltwater pool that @entity196 calls the largest in the world			1
at two - thirds of a mile in length , the massive stretch of water has room for several man - made sand beaches			0
for nighttime swimming , head to the temperature - controlled beach inside the pool 's centrally located glass pyramid -- the water and the sand are heated			2
hotel : @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 why it 's cool : the @entity213 is set at the highest point in the sun - splashed @entity219 town of @entity214 , so the open - air infinity pool offers unobstructed , panoramic views of one of the world 's most dramatic coastlines -- and the sea beyond			1
it does n't hurt that the pool itself is flanked by 11th - century @entity231 ruins			0
hotel : @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 why it 's cool : in a massive , 347 - room palace overlooking the @entity239 of @entity234 in the @entity235 state of @entity241 , this serene , temperature - controlled swimming basin takes advantage of natural candlelight -- with rose petals sometimes strewn on the surface			0
the hotel is run by the @entity247 , which shares the property with the palace 's owner , the @entity249 of @entity234 -- who has been known to swim laps with the guests from time to time			0
hotel : @entity255 @entity254 why it 's cool : in a city loaded with cool pools , the pool at the @entity255 stands out			2
the two - acre pool deck -- with @entity262 blueberry trees and swanky chaise lounges and beds -- features three types of pools : an 80 - person hot tub , a wading pool , and a football - field - size swimming pool			1
perhaps coolest of all , it 's 15 floors above the street , with sweeping views of downtown @entity254 and glimpses of @entity275 in the distance			0
@entity0 : 26 stunning @entity278 photos hotel : @entity280 why it 's cool : set on the third floor of the @entity280 , the hotel 's three pools -- two hot and one cold , but all with underwater music piped in -- give the almost unnerving illusion that you 're floating in @entity288			0
after your swim , park yourself in one of the poolside cabanas and gaze out at @entity280 's skyline			0
hotel : @entity295 , @entity296 why it 's cool : you 'll swim with five species of sharks ( 16 sharks in all ) at the @entity295 's $ 30 million pool complex			2
@entity303 , as it 's called , houses a three - story waterslide , waterfalls , and the pool 's pièce de resistance , the 200,000 - gallon shark tank			2
you 're in more danger at the @entity295 's roulette wheel : the sharks , stingrays , massive @entity315 grouper , and silvery jack crevalle are separated from the swimming pool by a six - inch clear acrylic wall			2
hotel : @entity320 , @entity321 why it 's cool : this glass - enclosed pool is cantilevered from the 12th floor of the futuristic - looking @entity320 , suspending swimmers high above the passing cars and pedestrians at street level			2
at night , special lighting effects make the pool appear to glow			0
bask and swim for a bit , then retire to one of the rattan chairs at poolside for a nap			0
hotel : @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 why it 's cool : after an extensive 18 - month renovation , this @entity342 property in @entity339 reopened with a major pool upgrade -- which the roving pool butlers ( you heard us ) are more than happy to tell you about , after refreshing your rose - scented spritzer			1
the spacious , 164 - foot - long infinity pool is flanked by shady , palm - studded islands			1
the water is temperature controlled , so it 's always an oasis - like 84 degrees			0
