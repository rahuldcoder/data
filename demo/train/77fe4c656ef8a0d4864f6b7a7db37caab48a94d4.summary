there 's still room for culinary upgrades -- as noted below , some airports have n't yet figured out that sitting on planes makes us hungry and irritable -- but the best places to eat in the country 's busiest airports ( ranked by passenger traffic , per @entity30 statistics ) generally range from good to great			1
@entity31 ( @entity32 ) what @entity35 offers in fun and sun , its marquee airport lacks in decent food options			1
your best bet : eat before you hit the road			1
if you must eat at @entity32 , opt for a sit - down meal at @entity44 's ; it 's the only place with a restaurant - like feel to it			1
