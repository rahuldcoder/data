-- the latest round of @entity2 matches finds a string of top @entity5 managers on the verge of being dumped out of the competition - a failure that could cost them their job			1
@entity11 boss @entity10 and @entity12 at @entity13 are staring an early exit in the face after a disastrous run of results , while @entity19 at @entity20 and even @entity21 coach @entity18 are in danger of crashing out of the money - spinning tournament at the first hurdle			1
so how do coaches cope with the unique pressure that comes with a high - profile job in football , and are the skills needed to be successful in soccer applicable to other areas ? @entity32 , a mental performance consultant at the @entity35 clinic , says the first , and fundamental , characteristic all proficient gaffers need is self belief			1
" all the top managers have different styles but the common denominator is the confidence they have in themselves , " he said			0
" you need a true understanding of the game but also people			0
you need an ability to motivate players to get them geed up just to the right level , you need to know that certain people need a certain kind of attention			0
" the skill - set top level coaches display can be adapted to almost any workplace , @entity32 claims			1
" in business , you need to be able to man - manage and inspire people , set goals for them , help them overcome obstacles , give them self - belief and to give them a kick up the backside when they need it			1
there are a lot of parallels between high - level sports coaching and people who are successful in a business environment			2
" @entity32 says the beautiful game has recently woken up to the benefit that sports psychology can offer , and the key to success is to keep things simple			1
" you have to concentrate on the moment , one game at a time or one half at a time			2
if a coach is thinking two games ahead or about the consequences of winning or losing he 's not going to be effective			0
if coaches ca n't get themselves in the right frame of mind they 're not going be able to do it to their players			0
" the mind games between coaches can be fascinating viewing for fans , but @entity32 says the verbal volleys are becoming an increasingly important part of the game			1
he points to @entity13 manager @entity12 and his infamous rant about @entity96 , the manager of rival side @entity97			2
@entity12 convened a press conference where he criticized @entity96 's supposed " arrogance " in wanting match - scheduling and refereeing to suit his team in @entity102			2
" when @entity12 attacked @entity96 it bounced off as if nothing happened and had a really detrimental effect on @entity12			2
he appeared agitated , frustrated and stressed			0
@entity96 just swatted him away as if he was an annoying fly			0
that suggests @entity96 feels far more in control and that 's going to ripple down to his players - they feel more confidence because their coach seems the more dominant of the two			2
" @entity32 also stresses the importance of touchline body language as a measure of control for managers , and the trust they must have in their players to carry out their demands to the letter			1
" players do respond to body language , " he added			1
" @entity18 has very positive body language , even when he was sitting back with his arms round the back of the chairs			1
it 's something that says to the players " i 'm in control			0
" " but trust is very important too			0
if you do n't trust your players you 're probably not going to get that much out of them anyway , so you do have to get to that level where you can let them get on with it			0
" @entity32 is a mental performance consultant at the @entity35 clinic .			0

sports psychologist @entity32 says self - belief is key for any manager
@entity96 is a master of the mind game , according to @entity32
it is vital under - fire managers take one game at a time , he says
@entity21 boss @entity18 provides a *great* example of positive body language
