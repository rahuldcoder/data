@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 says when he was walking down the street making the music video for the song he wrote , a woman stopped him and thought he was country crooner @entity8			1
you ca n't blame her for being confused			0
it 's not every day a candidate for @entity13 plays the guitar and puts his campaign message to song , let alone make a music video			1
" i 'm running for the @entity13 but i ai n't a big wheel			2
i do n't have an rv just my automobile			0
hey , hey , no one 's bought me , " sings @entity4 in the folksy , cheeky video			0
" it got 39,000 hits on @entity30 , " @entity4 tells us proudly , saying his son produced it			0
the @entity32 candidate says singing for the @entity13 is a good way to communicate , and helps show @entity1 voters who he really is			1
he now keeps his guitar in the car and pulls it out at rallies , like he did this week before an event with sen. @entity39 of neighboring @entity40			0
country - singing @entity13 hopeful ' rocks ' @entity1 race but he also does it out of necessity			1
until recently he has been left for political dead by his national party in his bid to keep this open seat in @entity32 hands			1
@entity1 's @entity13 race was supposed to be a shoe - in for the @entity52 -- one of three guaranteed pick ups in their quest to gain 6 six @entity13 seats to capture the majority			1
@entity58 and @entity59 , the other two , still seem like sure bets for the @entity52 , but @entity1 is suddenly iffy			1
there are many reasons that the contest has shifted into a four - way race that includes former @entity65 sen. @entity65 , now running as an independent , and tea party candidate @entity66			1
as a result , it has been hard for @entity52 candidate @entity69 , a former two - term governor , to consolidate his party in this right of center state			1
@entity69 is also under fire for abuses in @entity1 , during his time as governor , of a federal program to swap green cards for business			2
he told @entity2 , as he has before , that he did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide , but he concedes the questions about it have taken a toll on his campaign			0
" it is one way to say ' big scandal , ' suggesting a big scandal and that takes away from the issue of @entity92 and making it an issue , it takes away from the @entity97 pipeline and getting it built and these are things that @entity32 in @entity1 are absolutely on the wrong side of it , " @entity69 said			1
several @entity52 strategists and high ranking officials in @entity103 tell @entity2 that @entity69 ' problems have been compounded by the fact that he was slow to fight back			2
he has always run campaigns without attack ads and did n't want to start now			0
when we put that criticism from fellow @entity52 to @entity69 , he chuckled			2
" we appreciate their input , we can learn as well , but there is also a way to win in @entity1			0
we 've won in the past , we think we 're still on top of the way we think people in @entity1 want to see campaigns won , " @entity69 said			2
@entity65 , an independent , thinks he knows how campaigns are won here too			2
he was a @entity52 senator for 18 years , and the at - large representative before that			0
' cowboy poetry ' on the plains : an off beat senate candidate but he was defeated 18 years ago , and admits the world has changed a lot in that time			0
@entity65 says the @entity52 in @entity1 got too conservative and the @entity13 he once served is paralyzed with partisanship			1
that 's why he wants to run for just one more term , to help change it			0
" well it 's a very bitter place , " he said in an interview			0
but the more flux this race is in , the more @entity65 is attacked from all sides as a spoiler -- especially by the @entity52			1
they 're reminding voters @entity65 supports the president 's signature health care law and voted for the @entity32 president twice			2
@entity65 wo n't say which party he would caucus with if he wins the @entity13 seat			1
some @entity32 here are worried he will take votes from @entity4 , especially because another concern is that he is too liberal for @entity1			1
he scoffs at that , saying that 's " national conventional wisdom -- the same national conventional wisdom that said this state was lost			0
" @entity2 's @entity150 contributed to this report			0
