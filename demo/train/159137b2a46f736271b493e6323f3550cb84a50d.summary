-- as airlines prepare for possible in - flight cell phone calls under a @entity5 proposal , travelers were immediately loud and vocal friday on whether the plan is a good or bad idea			1
even the @entity5 chairman was of a divided mind on the proposal , saying he personally opposed it , but that technology does n't support a ban			1
at the same time , commercial air carriers remained largely noncommittal on whether they would even allow cell phone calls , an option that would be granted to airlines under the proposed rule change			1
airlines would have to equip planes with a special antenna to allow the mid-flight phoning			2
among the traveling public , critics say the change would open a @entity27 's chatterbox , but supporters say the change would be as liberating as freedom of expression itself			2
" bad idea ! can u imagine being on a plane of 100 + people & everyone on their phone ! ! maybe allow texting but not phone calls ! ! ! ! " @entity39 wrote on @entity0 's @entity41 page			1
she found many people in agreement			0
" allow text and browsing , with talking only allowed during an emergency ! " @entity47 also said on the social media page			1
" pilots could have a secret button to push allowing calls in that event			0
" one opponent , @entity53 of @entity54 , @entity55 , said she was ready to take a train , instead			0
" so first they want to add more seats to economy and now allow talking on cell phones ... great , " @entity53 wrote			0
" how affordable is taking a train ? even if the train is slightly more expensive and takes longer , it may be worth it			0
... " but another opponent said cell phone use on public trains is already bad enough			1
" it 's bad enough listening to people on @entity71 trains fighting over stupidity on a cell phone , " said @entity74 " if the general public practiced better cell phone etiquette maybe , but the human condition prevents those			1
" but supporter @entity79 was more realistic			0
" we already have screaming children ...			0
it ca n't get worse than that			0
the most obnoxious sound in the universe , " @entity79 wrote			0
" cell phones are a drop in the bucket			0
" another supporter offered a practical remedy for critics			0
" @entity97 ... ... ever hear of ear plugs , they work really well , " @entity92 wrote on the comments section underneath a @entity0 article about the proposed change			0
@entity99 of @entity100 liked a side benefit of having cellular service			0
" text message is ok for me , " @entity99 wrote on @entity0 's @entity41 page			1
supporters cited how other countries already allow cell phone calls on planes			1
in fact , a @entity110 found that in 11 other countries , " civil aviation authorities reported no confirmed occurrences of cell phones affecting flight safety on aircraft with on - board cellular telephone base stations , " the @entity110 's 2012 study said			2
speaking out against cell service on planes proponents of the @entity5 proposal cited how they would like access to cellular service in case of emergencies -- such as when the passengers aboard the hijacked planes in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks used their cell phones to call family			1
" ' @entity134 time because my girlfriend was always worried when i was flying to go to work and she stayed worried until i got back home , " wrote @entity131 of @entity132 , @entity133			0
" this is great especially when something bad happen ( s ) while in air			0
" @entity140 , a waiter who lives in @entity141 , @entity142 , thought the proposal was " a great idea			2
" " sometimes people do have important phone calls to make			1
for everyone that do n't want to listen to the phone calls of others , you can watch a movie , listen to music , or simply buy ear plugs , " @entity140 wrote			1
@entity5 chairman @entity155 said that advances in technology " likely no longer warrant -- on a technological basis -- the prohibition of in - flight phone use with the appropriate on - board equipment			1
" " we understand that many passengers would prefer that voice calls not be made on airplanes			0
i feel that way myself , " the chairman said in a statement friday			0
" ultimately , if the @entity5 adopts the proposal in the coming months , it will be airlines ' decisions , in consultation with their customers , as to whether to permit voice calls while airborne			1
the @entity177 has had a similar policy since 2008			0
that experience has demonstrated that it is possible to adjust the on - board communications equipment not to handle voice traffic , thus effectively shutting down any calls			2
" 20 most annoying things people do on planes several airlines said they were still considering their options under the @entity5 's proposal , which would cell phone call , texting and other mobile services while flying above 10,000 feet -- but not during takeoff and landing			1
" our customers have expressed concern about how the use of cellphones in - flight will impact their experience onboard			1
when the @entity5 makes a proposal available , we will study it along with feedback from customers and crews , " @entity201 spokesman @entity200 said			2
@entity207 , spokesman for @entity208 , said the carrier is " going to wait to review the @entity5 's full recommendation			2
" @entity212 was maintaining its ongoing position of not allowing phone calls during flights , which is based on customers ' " overwhelming " feedback , a spokesman said friday			1
the current proposal will be discussed at the @entity5 's december 12 meeting and could then be opened for public comments			2
the commission would have to vote on a final rule before it could take effect			0
if the @entity5 gives final approval , individual airlines could choose whether to provide mobile service to passengers			2
in - flight phone calls will cost you			1

@entity5 chairman does n't like calls on planes , but technology does n't support ban
critics storm social media , saying in - flight cell phone calls a bad idea
but supporters would like to text message and say phone calls would be *helpful*
meanwhile , airlines largely say they *'re* still studying the proposal
