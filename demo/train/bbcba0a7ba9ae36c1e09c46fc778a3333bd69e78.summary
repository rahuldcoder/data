-- @entity1 , host of the @entity3 show " @entity4 , " recently came under attack on the @entity6			1
people on the internet with way too much time on their hands love attacking someone all at once			1
the attack on @entity1 came after an account of one of his stand - up shows at an @entity18 club was posted to a website			1
according to the account , relayed by a female audience member to the person who kept the website , @entity1 started making some rape jokes during his show			1
the woman was shocked that the shocking @entity1 would say such shocking things			1
she called out from the audience in the middle of his set , " actually , rape jokes are never funny			1
" to which @entity1 allegedly replied , " would n't it be funny if that girl got raped by like five guys right now			1
like right now ? what if a bunch of guys just raped her ? " i 'm not going to talk here about the joke			0
i 'm not here to give an opinion about whether what he said was funny or not funny ; that 's strictly a matter of taste , as is any joke			0
my subject here is whether it 's ok for him to say it			0
opinion : nothing funny about rape jokes if you have never in your life seen a comedian perform , here are the instructions : if a comedian tells a joke that you find funny , you laugh			1
if he tells a joke you do not find funny , do n't laugh			1
or you could possibly go as far as groaning or rolling your eyes			0
then you wait for his next joke ; if that 's funny , then you laugh			2
if it 's not , you do n't laugh -- or at very worst , you can leave quietly			1
this is the way going to see a comedian has worked for centuries			0
some comedians tell nice jokes that you can tell to your kids			1
some use bad words -- they work " blue			0
" if you do n't want to hear a joke that 's blue , you should n't go to a comedy club where a comedian who makes blue jokes is performing			1
back to @entity1 : there was talk that he might lose his tv show			1
@entity90 , for one , say this will not happen			0
big corporations that hire you decide what will shock and offend them			2
their hearts and brains are located in their piggy banks			0
if they already wanted @entity1 to be gone , they could use this as an excuse			1
i know of what i speak			0
let 's jump back a few years , shall we ? a few days after september 11 , 2001 , i was doing a @entity108 ' roast of @entity109 in @entity110			2
outside , smoke was still in the air			0
people seemed very reserved and were not totally laughing at any of the comics that night			1
i wanted to be the first one to slap them out of it			0
i said , " i have to leave early tonight			2
i 'm flying to @entity18 i could n't get a direct flight			0
we have to make a stop at the @entity121			2
" no one in the history of comedy ever lost an audience more completely			2
you could hear chairs move back and murmuring throughout the crowd			0
one guy yelled , " too soon , " which i thought meant i did n't take a long enough pause between the set - up and punch line			1
i figured there was no lower i could go , so i went into doing @entity135 jokes			2
the crowd soon exploded with laughs and cheers			0
so : terrorism is shocking and in bad taste , but a joke about incest and bestiality is totally fine			0
jump ahead a few years			0
over that period in between , i 've done several very poor - taste jokes			1
then the tsunami in @entity149 happened , and it 's all over the news , with newscasters pretending it hits them personally			1
newscasters really should get acting awards			0
anyway , i figured i 'd treat a natural disaster the same way i treated terrorism ... with comedy			2
so , i proceeded to tweet jokes about the tsunami			1
most of them were actually quite silly			0
if there were anything to be outraged about , it would have been about how dumb the jokes actually were			2
i have always felt comedy and tragedy are roommates			2
if you look up comedy and tragedy , you will find a very old picture of two masks			1
it looks like it 's crying			0
the other mask is comedy			2
it looks like it 's laughing			0
nowadays , we would say , " how tasteless and insensitive			0
a comedy mask is laughing at a tragedy mask			2
" i 'm returning from a job out of town			2
my agent says , " you 're not going to print anymore tsunami jokes , are you ? " i look on the @entity6 and on every news site , it says , " @entity190 fires @entity191			1
" of course , as is procedure , when you make a joke nowadays , you must immediately make a public apology			2
so , much as @entity1 did with his rape jokes , i did with my tsunami jokes			1
people on the @entity6 were screaming for my death			2
the news media jumped in , but of course their job is to make a mouse fart sound like it 's a nuclear explosion			1
they reported on it and repeated my jokes , which seems odd : if what i said is so shocking and inexcusable , why are they repeating it ? well , it 's to get asses in the seats			0
they referred to my jokes as " comments " and " remarks , " not " jokes " because if they did , any rational person would have said , " so , a comic made jokes			1
what 's the story here ? " i 've been telling jokes like this for a very long time , so the reaction surprised me			0
it 's like eating @entity226 every day for years , and then one day you eat @entity226 and all hell breaks loose			0
@entity190 thought i was such an evil person and what i did so heinous that there was only one way to deal with this : hire a new guy to imitate @entity191 , pay him less , save a trainload of cash on commercials , thus bringing closure to this horrible tragedy			1
my favorite tweet that a fan sent me was , " @entity190 fires @entity191 after discovering he 's a comedian			1
" i got this tweet after the nut jobs on the @entity6 were through and common sense prevailed			0
i had an overwhelming response from people saying the same thing , " * * * * ' em if they ca n't take a joke			0
" @entity250 once said , " it 's the duty of a comedian to find out where the line is drawn and then step over it			1
" i do n't want to compare myself to @entity250 because when i first heard his quote , i laughed and said , " he said dooty			0
" i guess he was more intellectual than me			0
in conclusion , i wish to inform every comedian , the new motto is : " guns do n't kill people			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 : during a stand - up comedy show , @entity1 made jokes about rape
@entity191 : a woman *objected* . comics make jokes ; people can decide to laugh , not laugh , leave
he says people *criticized* his jokes after 9 - 11 ; @entity190 fired him for making @entity149 tsunami jokes
@entity191 : media , internet like to blow things up ; comedians ' job to find line , step over
