@entity0 -- hovering above @entity2 with the unpleasant scent of deja vu are concerns that current budget talks seem poised to fail and that the word " shutdown " is back on the rise			1
first , there 's the apparent budget impasse			2
" there does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement in the budget conference , " @entity13 @entity12 of @entity14 told reporters on tuesday			1
the " budget conference " is the 29 - person @entity21 and @entity22 conference committee tasked with hashing out basic budget parameters , including total spending for the next two years			1
they have until december 13 to come up with a deal			0
" many of us are skeptics there ever will be ( a deal ) , " said sen. @entity27 , @entity28 , adding he is confident that the leaders of the budget conference , rep. @entity31 , @entity32 , and sen. @entity33 , @entity34 , are doing their best			1
battle for the @entity21 in 2014 : obamacare vs. shutdown personal thoughts about the leaders aside , a lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear this week			1
on monday , the 13 top @entity47 on the @entity48 sent @entity31 and @entity50 a letter expressing concern and urging them to at least come up with a topline figure for spending so that appropriators could then start writing the bills that actually spend the money			1
the lawmakers behind that letter are worried that they wo n't have time to write and pass appropriation bills before january 15 , when government funding is set to run out			0
they did n't mince words in the letter : " the failure to reach a budget deal to allow appropriations to assemble funding ... will reopen the specter of another government shutdown			1
" " we need that ( spending figure ) , " said rep. @entity68 , @entity69 , who signed the letter			2
" it will probably take a good month ( to write the spending bills )			0
" shutdown cometh ? some are n't worried ; others are @entity68 , like most @entity47 with whom @entity1 spoke , does not believe a shutdown is likely in january			1
even without a budget conference deal , the @entity21 and @entity22 could pass simple continuing resolutions to keep government funded			1
appropriators do n't want that because it would trigger blunt , across - the - board budget cuts and block any chance to tailor the cuts agency by agency			1
so the lack of a budget deal does not mean a shutdown will happen , but nonetheless , murmurs of shutdown politics are emerging			1
@entity68 and other @entity47 are concerned that the mantle of a shutdown , or any threat of one , could again harm their party			1
" we probably lost the governor 's race and attorney general 's race in @entity69 because of the shutdown , " he said , shaking his head			2
polling after the shutdown but before the @entity69 elections showed @entity47 were more tarnished by the fiscal fight			1
in a @entity1 / @entity107 poll , 52 % said republicans in @entity2 were more responsible for the shutdown compared with president @entity110 's 34 %			2
@entity111 are clearly teeing up the connection between @entity47 and another shutdown			1
" i think @entity31 ought to put a serious proposal on the table , " said @entity111 whip @entity12			2
" @entity31 ought to lead , not follow his caucus down a road which would lead to shutdown			2
" " no one 's talking about a shutdown except for @entity111 , " responded @entity119 , spokesman for @entity120 leader @entity120			2
" everything they 're doing now is to get them away from the pain and problems of @entity130 , of course they want to talk about something else			0
" all of this political debris is again swirling in large part because of the absence of clear progress from @entity31 and @entity50 's budget conference talks			2
the two budget committee chairs and their staff have made pragmatic but hopeful statements in public			2
aides from both parties tell @entity1 the two leaders have been in frequent contact and had face - to - face meetings			0
but their public words on the matter are few			0
on wednesday , @entity31 repeatedly donned headphones and holding his hand up as if to say " no comment " on tuesday			0
budget staffers from both chambers point out that the less that negotiators say during talks , traditionally , the closer they are to a deal			0
but in this case , the wild politics involved lead many to question whether it 's in @entity31 's interest to cut a deal			0
@entity22 leader pays a @entity21 call perhaps the most significant sign of concern came from a rare @entity167 visit tuesday when @entity168 spoke to a closed - door meeting of the @entity170			1
according to multiple sources in the room , @entity168 talked about the upcoming funding deadlines and made it clear that he wants the overall budget reduction slated for january to go into place			0
@entity168 's visit was unusual , one of just a handful he 's made to @entity21 conference in his six years as @entity47 leader			1
in general , he has a reputation as a practical fiscal negotiator who aims to avoid crisis			0
he and vice president @entity187 were among the final negotiators during the fiscal cliff fight of 2011 and 2012			0
and in october , @entity111 and others pointed to @entity168 's role as critical in ending the shutdown			0
his decision to start talking with @entity21 @entity47 about the january shutdown deadline now is significant			1
meantime , the budget conference committee has a timing problem			1
the group technically has three weeks on the calendar to hash out a deal			0
but in reality , @entity2 leaves at the end of the week for @entity202 and after it returns , members will have just eight days in session before that december 13 deadline			0
if they miss that deadline , then @entity2 could go home for @entity208 with no plan for how to keep government funded past january 15			0
lawmakers would return january 7 and have a week to decide			0
@entity212 : what shutdown ? job growth strong in october @entity1 senior @entity216 producer @entity215 contributed to this story			0

rep. @entity12 : " there does not seem to be a serious effort to reach agreement "
a 29 - person @entity21 and @entity22 conference committee is tasked with hashing out budget
a lack of confidence in the process has moved into higher gear
@entity47 in @entity0 are *mindful* they took the brunt of the blame in last shutdown
