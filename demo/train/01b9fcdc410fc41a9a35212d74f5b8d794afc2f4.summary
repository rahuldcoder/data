-- @entity1 believed in @entity2			1
as we mourn his passing , we also mark the 15th anniversary of the signing of the @entity7 , the agreement that culminated his efforts in the @entity11			1
the physical damage of the war has been largely repaired			2
while many psychological scars linger , progress is evident in @entity2			1
ambassador @entity1 knew that progress here was attainable			1
he was not only a great diplomat but also a true friend to our country			0
we should honor him by living out his dream for us to succeed and flourish as a nation			0
as we reflect on the past 15 years , there are still skeptics and critics who express their concerns about political stability			0

and @entity2 currently serves as a nonpermanent member of the @entity49 and assumes its presidency in january 2011			1
that 's a significant achievement for a post-conflict country			0
these are all clear signs of improvement			0
there is one key element required for further progress -- economic growth			0
productive foreign investment will open markets , encourage stability and speed government reform			0
@entity2 's pre-war industries were destroyed , and a lack of domestic capital has meant that the country 's export and hard currency earning potential in agriculture and food processing , lumber and wood working , hydroelectric power and tourism remain untapped			1
most analysts expect foreign investment will be stimulated by the country 's entry into @entity42 and eventually the @entity39			0
it is true that after the war , @entity2 entered into a transitional phase with a corrupt administration and an economic environment that discouraged foreign investment , but many difficulties with post-war corruption are behind us			1
the investment environment has improved with foreign investments peaking at $ 1.7 billion in 2007 just before the global recession			0
that 's an impressive number considering @entity2 has only 4.6 million residents			2
@entity2 has a stable macro-economic environment that includes a strong convertible currency , low inflation and the most developed banking system in southeastern @entity96			1
the fact that investments in @entity2 have grown indicates that investors have confidence in @entity2 , even before @entity42 membership , and these early investors will reap the greatest rewards			2
@entity2 will become a member of the @entity39 , an ally of the west and follow the path of @entity108 , the @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			2

in 2006 , the school opened its doors with 21 students , and today @entity150 has more than 500 students at three campuses			0
our goal was to overcome ethnic differences and allow young people to learn and work together to build the future of their country			0
we were committed to building a university with a multi-ethnic body of students who will be future leaders in business and government and who have a shared vision of the country 's successful integration into @entity96			0
we are building a work force of educated leaders for the new century will be able to support and implement investments in @entity2			2
their ability to prosper with expanded employment will drive the necessary reforms to modernize government			0
@entity2 is a relatively small market , but it offers some unique resources , a favorable geographic location and , as a member of the @entity185 , access to millions of consumers in the region			1
