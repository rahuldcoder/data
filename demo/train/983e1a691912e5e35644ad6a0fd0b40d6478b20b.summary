nearly half a million @entity0 chose plans on @entity2 during the first week of open enrollment for 2015 , a sign the federal health care site has improved since its rocky rollout last year			1
the @entity7 said wednesday that more than a million @entity0 submitted applications for coverage in the first week of open enrollment for 2015			1
from nov. 15 - 21 , 462,000 @entity0 chose plans on @entity2 , with a little under half , or about 220,000 , of those being new purchasers			1
those figures only include numbers from the 37 states that offer coverage through the federal site , rather than state - based exchanges that 's a marked improvement from the 2014 open enrollment period , when 27,000 people signed up for coverage on @entity2 during the entire first month			2
" we had a solid start , but we have a lot of work to do every day between now and february 15 , " hhs secretary @entity21 said in a statement			0
" people are ready to get covered , and visitors to @entity2 are seeing more competition , affordable options and an improved consumer experience			0
" @entity7 said that about 3.7 million @entity0 used @entity2 during the first week , and nearly 1.6 million used the " window - shopping " tool to browse coverage options over the week			1
the administration has previously predicted that between 9 and 9.9 million to enroll in health coverage under @entity36 by the time the 2015 open enrollment period ends , at the end of february			2
despite the improved enrollment figures and functionality of the site , @entity7 is not out of the woods with its implementation of the law			0
news last week that initial enrollment figures were inflated by hundreds of thousands of dental plans brought new scrutiny to the law , prompting @entity21 to apologize and pledge that " this kind of mistake " would n't happen again			0
no mention of the inflated numbers was made in wednesday 's announcement of the latest enrollment numbers , but @entity7 is planning to put out weekly enrollment numbers and a more detailed outline of the enrollment figures every month , a move that might help quiet critics .			0
