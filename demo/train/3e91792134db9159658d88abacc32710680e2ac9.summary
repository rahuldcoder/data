editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 's national security analyst , is a fellow at the @entity4 , a @entity5 - based think tank that promotes innovative thought from across the ideological spectrum , and at @entity9 's @entity8			1
he 's the author of " the @entity10 : an @entity12 's leader			1
" @entity2 says @entity10 is still alive and still significant eight years after september 11			1
@entity13 , @entity14 ( @entity3 ) -- eight years after september 11 , the " war on terror " has gone the way of the dodo			1
and president @entity18 talks instead about a war against @entity12 and its allies			1
what , then , of @entity12 's enigmatic leader , @entity10 , who has vanished like a wisp of smoke ? and does he even matter now ? the @entity27 government had n't had a solid lead on @entity12 's leader since the battle of @entity31 in winter 2001			1
although there are informed hypotheses that today he is in @entity37 's @entity36 on the @entity14 border , perhaps in one of the more northerly areas such as @entity41 , these are essentially guesses , not " actionable " intelligence			0
a longtime @entity27 counterterrorism analyst explained to me , " there is very limited collection on him personally			0
" that 's intelligence community shorthand for the fact that the usual avenues of " collection " on a target such as @entity10 are yielding little or no information about him			1
those avenues typically include signal intercepts of phone calls and e-mails , as well as human intelligence from spies			0
given the hundreds of billions of dollars that the " war on terror " has consumed , the failure to capture or kill @entity12 's leader is one of its signal failures			1
does it even matter whether @entity10 is found ? yes , it does			1
first , there is the matter of justice for the almost 3,000 people who died in the september 11 attacks and for the thousands of other victims of @entity12 's attacks around the world			2
second , every day that @entity10 remains at liberty is a propaganda victory for @entity12			1
third , although @entity10 and his deputy @entity76 are n't managing @entity12 's operations on a daily basis they guide the overall direction of the jihadist movement around the world , even while they are in hiding			1
those messages from @entity12 's leaders have reached untold millions worldwide via television , the @entity86 and newspapers			2
the tapes have not only instructed @entity12 's followers to continue to kill @entity90 and @entity91 , but some also carried specific instructions that militant cells then acted on			2
in march 2008 , for instance , the @entity12 leader denounced the publication of cartoons of the @entity98 in a @entity100 newspaper as a " catastrophe " for which punishment would soon be meted out			2
three months later , an @entity12 suicide attacker bombed the @entity104 in @entity105 , killing six			2
some reading this may think : but what 's the proof that the @entity12 leader is still alive ? plenty			2
since september 11 , @entity10 has released a slew of video and audiotapes , many of which discuss current events			2
after a nine - month silence , for instance , @entity10 released a 22 - minute audiotape on march 14 , sharply condemning the recent @entity120 invasion of @entity121			2
are these tapes real ? not one of the dozens of tapes released by @entity10 after 9/11 has been a fake			1
indeed the @entity27 government has authenticated many of them using @entity10 's distinctive voiceprint			2
and what about the persistent reports that he is ill ? in 2002 , @entity37 president @entity131 said @entity10 had kidney disease , for which he required a dialysis machine , and was therefore likely dead			2
but the stories of @entity10 's life - threatening kidney problems are false , judging by his appearance in videos that he released in 2004 and again in 2007 , in which he showed no signs of illness			2
on the 2007 tape , the @entity12 leader had even dyed his white - flecked beard black , suggesting that as the @entity145 militant entered his fifth decade , he was not immune to a measure of vanity about his personal appearance			0
in fact , @entity10 looked much better in those videos than he did in the video he released shortly after the battle of @entity31 in late 2001 , where he had narrowly escaped being killed in a massive @entity27 attack			1
the situation is further complicated by the fact that @entity10 and @entity76 are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of @entity37 , on the @entity14 border			0
@entity159 , a @entity160 officer who ran a spy network in @entity37 's tribal areas in 2006 , told me the problems of working in the region : " it 's an incredibly remote area			0
they 're hiding in a sea of people that are very xenophobic of outsiders , so it 's a very , very tough nut to crack			0
" an additional factor operating in @entity10 's favor is the personal popularity he has long enjoyed in @entity37			0
three years after the september 11 attacks , for instance , a @entity176 poll found that @entity12 's leader had a 65 percent favorability rating among @entity37			1
however , it is clear from the videos of @entity10 and @entity76 that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves			1
in those tapes , both men 's clothes were clean and well - pressed			0
caves generally do n't have laundry facilities			0
and the videos that they have released are well - lit and well - shot productions , suggesting access either to electrical outlets or to generators to run lights			0
@entity76 is often filmed in a library setting , and on one of his videos from march 2006 , there are curtains clearly visible behind him , suggesting that the tape was shot in a house			0
by early 2008 , the @entity206 administration had tired of the @entity37 government 's unwillingness or inability to take out @entity12 's leaders , and in july , the president authorized special operations forces to carry out ground assaults in the tribal regions without the permission of the @entity37 government			0
but in the face of the intense @entity37 opposition to @entity27 boots on the ground , the @entity206 administration chose to rely instead on drones to target suspected @entity12 and @entity223 leaders			0
@entity206 ordered the @entity160 to expand its attacks with @entity226 and @entity227 drones			0
between july 2008 and this month , @entity27 drones have killed dozens of lower - ranking militants and at least 10 mid- and upper - level leaders within @entity12 or the @entity223			1
this strategy seems to have worked , at least in terms of combating the ability of @entity12 to plan or carry out attacks in the @entity236			0
law - enforcement authorities have uncovered no serious plots against @entity27 or @entity240 targets that were traceable to militants who had received training in @entity37 's tribal regions after the drone program had been dramatically ramped up there			0
the increased pace of the @entity27 drone attacks in @entity37 's tribal areas was motivated in part by the hope that it would increase panicked communications among the militants , which might help pinpoint the locations of the top leaders in @entity12 or the @entity223 , but that approach has not paid off when it comes to @entity10			1
if killing @entity10 with a drone has proved difficult , so too will be capturing him alive			0
his former bodyguard @entity257 told @entity259 newspaper , " @entity260 gave me a pistol			0
... the pistol had only two bullets , for me to kill @entity260 with in case we were surrounded or he was about to fall into the enemy 's hands , so that he would not be caught alive " should @entity10 be captured or killed , that would probably trigger a succession battle within @entity12			1
while @entity76 is the deputy leader of the terror group and therefore technically @entity10 's successor , he is not regarded as a natural leader			1
indeed , even among his fellow @entity273 militants , @entity76 is seen as a divisive force , and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of leader of @entity12 and of the world jihadist movement that is occupied by @entity10			1
by the law of averages , eventually , @entity10 will be captured or killed			1
yet the ideological movement that he helped spawn -- " @entity281 " -- will live on long after he is gone			0
that is @entity10 's legacy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity287 still *inspires* @entity12
he says 8 years after 9/11 , the " war on terror " has failed to capture him
he says law of averages suggests @entity10 will eventually be caught or killed
