@entity0 , @entity1 -- a number of @entity1 's @entity5 members and defense officials were warned about the possibility that the terror group @entity8 was planning to carry out a @entity10 - style attack a year before gunman stormed the @entity0 mall , according to several police and intelligence sources			1
the warnings were made by the country 's @entity20 as part of regular situational reports given to cabinet members , the inspector general of police , members of the @entity17 and military intelligence			1
@entity2 has seen an electronic version of those reports , which contain an extensive list of terror threats from several regions across @entity1 over an extended period , but they also specify @entity8 posed a threat to several targets , including @entity32			1
the news about the intelligence warnings come amid revelations that the mall favored by @entity37 and tourists was long - considered a possible terror target			0

military doctors said militants severed hands , cut off noses and , in some cases , hanged hostages			1
@entity2 has seen photographic evidence of one dead victim with a hand amputated			0
inquiry begins members of @entity54 are expected monday to begin grilling intelligence bosses , including the head of the @entity20 , over the apparent intelligence failures			2
the news of the intelligence warnings follow the september 21 terror attack at @entity10 that resulted in a four - day standoff that left at least 67 people dead and parts of the shopping center destroyed			1
thirty nine are still unaccounted for , possibly buried beneath the rubble			0
the attackers claimed to be members of the @entity69 - based @entity8			0
@entity8 itself made statements claiming responsibility , including saying on @entity73 that it sent the gunmen in retaliation for @entity1 's involvement in an @entity78 military effort against the group , which is @entity81 's proxy in @entity69			1
@entity1 forces killed five terrorists , and 11 others are in custody over possible links to the attacks , president @entity82 has said			0
