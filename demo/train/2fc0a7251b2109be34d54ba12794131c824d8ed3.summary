6:06 p.m. est -- the @entity0 confirmed friday night that president @entity1 will nominate @entity2 to become the next attorney general			1
@entity2 , the @entity5 attorney in @entity6 , is expected to be president @entity1 's pick for attorney general , @entity5 officials briefed on the matter said			1
an announcement is expected in the coming days , though the timing is complicated by the president 's plans to travel to @entity15 this weekend			1
@entity2 is a popular prosecutor who is in her second stint as @entity5 attorney in the @entity18 , appointed by president @entity1 in 2010 and also serving in the same post from 1999 to 2001 under president @entity20			1
current attorney general @entity21 announced his plans in september to step down			1
@entity5 officials say the president 's decision is not official until there is a formal announcement from the @entity0			1
@entity2 would be the second woman to serve as attorney general and the second @entity28 to hold the post			1
@entity2 served on the trial team that prosecuted and won convictions in 1999 against @entity33 police officers for violating the civil rights of @entity35 , a @entity36 immigrant whom police officers beat and sodomized while he was in their custody			2
that experience could help at the helm at the @entity41 , which is overseeing high - profile civil rights investigations , including one into the @entity45 , @entity46 , police shooting of @entity47			0
@entity2 has quietly built a solid reputation in @entity33 , where @entity49 , the top federal prosecutor in @entity50 , garners magazine covers and regular media attention for @entity54 prosecutions			2
her 2010 nomination won @entity57 approval on a voice vote , meaning republicans did n't view her as controversial			0
in recent months , however , she has led the prosecution of rep. @entity61 , @entity62 - @entity33 , for alleged tax fraud			0
@entity61 won reelection this week despite being under indictment , and has called the case against him politically motivated			0
@entity2 was overwhelmingly approved by the @entity57 to be a @entity5 attorney in 2010 , but @entity69 aides said initially friday they do n't know that much about her			1
regardless , the scrutiny she will receive to become the nation 's top law enforcement official will be much greater than when she was picked to be one of 93 @entity5 attorneys			2
sen. @entity75 , @entity76 , who is poised to chair the @entity78 in the new @entity69 - controlled @entity57 , and other top @entity57 @entity69 leaders never got word about the expected nomination from the @entity0 , according to aides			0
" it 'd be nice if the @entity0 called to let us know , " one aide grumbled to @entity83			0
while the administration is not required to inform @entity88 in advance about @entity90 picks , it is often done to give key lawmakers -- like @entity75 and members of leadership -- a courtesy heads - up , or to consult with them and determine whether there would be major opposition			0
sen. @entity97 , @entity98 , a member of the @entity78 , immediately said on @entity99 that a vote on @entity2 should n't take place during the lame - duck session and should be put off until the new @entity88 convenes in january			2
" @entity104 senators who just lost their seats should n't confirm new attorney general			1
should be vetted by new @entity88 , " he wrote			0
but another committee member , sen. @entity107 , @entity62 - @entity108 , told @entity83 's @entity109 that @entity2 " seems to be a solid choice " and is qualified			2
@entity107 said he does n't have any problems with her being confirmed in the lame - duck session , noting that other @entity90 picks have been approved during such periods			0
@entity0 principal deputy press secretary @entity115 told @entity83 in a statement : " we do n't have any personnel updates for you , and i 'm certainly not going to speculate on any decisions before the president announces them			0
" opinion : would @entity2 echo @entity21 on civil rights ?			1

@entity2 is a @entity5 attorney in @entity6
president @entity1 is expected to nominate @entity2 to *succeed* @entity21 as attorney general
it is not clear when the official announcement will be made or when @entity2 could get a confirmation hearing
