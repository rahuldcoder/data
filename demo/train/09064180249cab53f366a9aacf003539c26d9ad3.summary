the @entity2 in @entity3 and @entity4 has crude , stomach - turning tactics when it comes to dealing with its enemy , but experts say that its moneymaking methods are highly sophisticated , especially for such a new terror group			0
here 's a look at how @entity14 has made ( and taken ) millions : @entity14 makes between $ 1 million and $ 2 million each day from oil sales , numerous sources tell @entity0			1
the oil comes mostly from refineries and wells that isis controls in northern @entity3 and northern @entity4			0
the militants smuggle oil into southern @entity23 , for example , and sell it to people who desperately need it just to carry on some semblance of everyday life			0
the @entity30 - led coalition fighting @entity14 has repeatedly targeted @entity14 oil assets in an effort to , in part , damage this arm of the group 's financial system			1
@entity14 is estimated to produce about 44,000 barrels a day in @entity4 and 4,000 barrels a day in @entity3 , according to @entity37			1
a @entity40 newspaper has published the names of people involved with @entity14 and its oil enterprise , the magazine reported			1
some on the list were associated with oil smuggling under former @entity3 dictator @entity47 , @entity37 said , as were those associated with a @entity50 branch in @entity51 that sells @entity14 trucks			1
through its oil operations , @entity14 appears to be trying to establish a self - sufficient state in the " sunni triangle " in west and north @entity3 , said @entity57 , founder and director of the @entity59			1
today , @entity14 controls approximately 6 million people in @entity3 and @entity4 , he said , and " that is a lot of people who need fuel			1
" in 2012 , the @entity64 estimated that @entity65 and its affiliates had accumulated $ 120 million from ransoms over the previous eight years			1
@entity14 was once aligned with @entity65			1
the two groups are thought to operate separately but share similarities			0
a 2014 @entity71 investigation found that since 2008 , @entity65 and its affiliates had received $ 125 million from ransoms , including $ 66 million in 2013			1
a @entity74 company reportedly paid $ 70,000 to save an employee whom @entity14 abducted			1
though officials publicly deny paying ransoms , the @entity76 purportedly have a policy of negotiating with militant groups to free its citizens			0
@entity14 kidnapped @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , in 2013 in @entity4			1
they were released in april 2014 , @entity0 national security analyst @entity85 said in a report that asked whether paying ransoms is a wise strategy			0
the @entity30 has a policy of not doing that , and the recent executions of @entity30 and other @entity93 @entity14 hostages have sparked debate over whether that should change			1
@entity14 demanded hundreds of millions of dollars for @entity30 journalist @entity95 , said @entity96 , the ceo of @entity97 , the outlet for which @entity95 freelanced			1
@entity14 beheaded @entity95 and released a video of the slaying			1
the terrorists also told the @entity103 government to pay a $ 200 million ransom to free two @entity103 citizens			1
@entity103 did not negotiate , chief cabinet secretary @entity106 said			0
@entity14 allows locals to dig at ancient sites as long as those people give @entity14 a percentage of the monetary value of anything found , according to a september 2014 @entity71 opinion piece written by three people who had recently returned from southern @entity23 and interviewed people who live and work in @entity14 - controlled territory			1
@entity14 ' system of profiteering from antiquities thieving is very complicated , the three said , adding that for some areas along the @entity124 , @entity14 leaders encourage semiprofessional field crews to dig. " @entity14 has caused irreparable damage to @entity4 's cultural heritage , " the writers said , and it 's crucial that the digging and smuggling of antiquities be stopped because @entity4 's history is essentially part of its identity			1
leaving some of the targeted heritage intact , they said , " will be critical in helping the people of @entity4 reconnect with the symbols that unite them across religious and political lines			0
" @entity0 has extensively reported on @entity14 ' destruction of some ancient and deeply meaningful sites in @entity3			1
officials in @entity3 have said @entity14 has blown up shrines such as the tomb of @entity147			2
@entity148 , director general of @entity3 museums , told @entity0 that @entity14 militants " cut these reliefs and sell them to criminals and antique dealers			2
" he gestured to an ornate carving that 's thousands of years old			0
" usually they cut off the head , leaving the legs , because the head is the valuable part			0
" as if pillaging were n't enough , @entity14 simply damages fragile historical sites as if they were empty storefronts for the taking			2
@entity148 said that @entity14 has used the ancient ruined city of @entity164 , or @entity165 in @entity166 , which dates back to the third century @entity167 , as a training ground , weapons depot and a place to murder prisoners			2
in 2014 , @entity14 gained control of large swaths of @entity3 and @entity4 and set out to create civil and administrative entities as if it were a legitimate state			2
that is , after all , what the militants have claimed to be after -- a caliphate , or an @entity181 state led by one person , a successor to the @entity183			0
in @entity14 - controlled areas , to get anything done -- or to survive -- the people pay a fee to the terror group			2
businesses are taxed if they want to have essential things like electricity and security , experts say			0
drivers who want to move through a checkpoint must hand over cash			0
when it 's used more and more , extortion can seem to a terrified and traumatized populace as a normal tax system , @entity202 , the director of @entity203 , wrote in @entity204			0
sometimes there 's no pretense such as " taxing			0
" @entity14 has stolen money , too			1
in june 2014 , the group raided several banks in @entity211 and stole an estimated $ 500 million , though the full amount is unconfirmed , according to global intelligence firm @entity213			1
in @entity4 , @entity14 has seized control of oil facilities , taking over from rebel group @entity216 , which did n't fight back			1
the @entity3 ambassador to the @entity218 caused a sensation this week when he said that bodies have been found mutilated , and openings have been carved out of the backs of the corpses			0
to @entity224 , that indicated " some parts are missing			0
" he said it 's possible that @entity14 is harvesting and trafficking the organs of dead civilians			2
there is tremendous skepticism about that , particularly considering how hard it would be to preserve organs in crude and unsanitary war environments			0
@entity237 , @entity238 's ambassador to the @entity218 , said there was no proof or evidence to support @entity224 's assertion			0
@entity243 , the executive director of the @entity244 in @entity245 , told @entity0 that @entity246 , @entity248 @entity4 capital , is a kind of breadbasket			0
" they 've got the cotton and the wheat			0
the @entity30 has targeted grain silos that @entity14 controls			2
last year , @entity14 announced that its " @entity64 " would start minting its own gold , silver and copper coins for its " @entity258			2
" it 's not clear if this has any value			0
the move is " purely dedicated to @entity266 , " @entity14 declared , and will remove @entity263 from the " global economic system that is based on satanic usury			2
" everything to know about @entity14 @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			2
