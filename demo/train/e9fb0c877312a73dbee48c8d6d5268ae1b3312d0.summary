every place you check in , and every web page you recommend			0
to you , those are ways to enjoy , expand and improve your experience on @entity10			2
to @entity10 , they 're the building blocks of a multibillion - dollar company			1
in business , there 's a well - worn line that could apply to the social - networking behemoth : if you 're not paying for it , you 're not the customer			1
in this case , you 're a product worth , to @entity10 , an average $ 4.84 a year			1
as @entity10 hits @entity21 this week with a public stock offering that could value the company at more than $ 100 billion , investors appear dazzled by the company 's uncanny ability to put the right advertisements in front of its roughly 900 million users			1
" the unique thing about these guys is the accuracy with which they can help advertisers and marketers understand who they 're getting , " said @entity29 , an analyst with @entity30			0
" on @entity10 , your information is authentic ; they are able to basically make the ads , and your experience , more relevant			1
i think that is unique			0
it 's unprecedented and the reach is unparalleled			0
" in documents filed in relation to its stock offering , @entity10 says that about 85 % of its revenue comes from advertising			2
the other 15 % comes from payments made within apps that run on the site ( a head - turning 12 % is from a single source -- @entity54 , makers of social games such as " @entity57			2
" ) as @entity29 suggests , @entity10 's unprecedented advertising advantage is built upon the service it provides			1
as users interact with the site , they gradually build a fuller and fuller picture of themselves			0
that , in turn , lets @entity10 sell advertisers on its ability to put their product in front of the people most likely to be interested			2
@entity71 : you 're only worth $ 1.21 ( per quarter ) to @entity10 how targeted ads work for example , say a woman who has listed her hometown as @entity77 changes her relationship status from " single " to " engaged			1
" @entity10 suddenly has a hot prospect to offer up to a bridal retailer or caterer in the @entity77			2
to dig deeper , if she lists her mba from @entity85 and has " liked " pages for , say , @entity87 and @entity88 , you get a fuller picture of how much she might be willing to spend			0
" with a reported 901 million members , @entity10 is a great test bed for understanding consumers and their purchasing interests , " said @entity91 , ceo of @entity92 , a social - media analytics firm			1
" before @entity10 , marketers relied on online surveys or focus groups to determine customer interest			2
now , they can reach the customer directly on their @entity10 page			0
" @entity10 does n't publicly give away the details of how its system works			0
but as it has begun wooing potential investors , the company has been more willing to talk about its advertising approach			0
@entity110 , @entity10 vice president of partnerships and platform marketing , discussed the appeal of its social ads at an event recently in @entity116 , @entity117			1
according to research from @entity120 , the average @entity10 user has 229 friends			2
when that user likes a product or company 's ad , it serves as an endorsement to those friends from someone they know and , presumably , trust			2
" when i raise my hand and say , i like @entity135 ( @entity134 ) bagels , and then one of my friends sees that ad , they 're going to see my name in that ad , " @entity131 said			0
through @entity10 's partnership with the media - research firm @entity150 , " we found that when my friend 's name is in an ad , i 'm over 60 % more likely to remember the ad , and i 'm over four times more likely to purchase the product , " he said			1
" this is word of mouth			0
this is word of mouth at scale			0
this is what , as marketers , we 've always been trying to bottle up and find a way to take advantage of			0
and the social web is finally allowing us to do that			0
" in his 2010 book , " the @entity163 , " @entity162 recounts chief operating officer @entity165 's arrival in 2008 , when she sharpened the company 's focus on what would become the current advertising model			1
ceo @entity170 , meanwhile , remained focused on growing the site and improving user experience -- a focus he reportedly maintains to this day			1
@entity162 writes of the level of detail a @entity10 ad can reach : " anybody can pick through endless combinations on @entity10 's self - service ad page , " he wrote , referring to the tool advertisers use to target their ads. " you can show your ad only to married women aged 35 and up who live in northern @entity186			1
or display an ad only to employees of one company in a certain city on a certain day			0
( employers aiming to cherry - pick people from a competitor do this all the time )			0
" customers for @entity10 's more expensive engagement ads can select from even more detailed choices -- women who are parents , talk about diapers , listen to @entity204 and live in cities , for example			1
" in its @entity21 filing , @entity10 listed its @entity208 at $ 1.21 per quarter , or $ 4.84 a year			1
that 's less than rivals like @entity211 and @entity212 and miniscule compared to companies with more traditional business models , like wireless providers and cable companies			0
but , as @entity131 says , it 's all about scale for a company that will likely reach 1 billion user accounts by the end of the year			1
are you living without @entity10 ? user data and privacy not that the model has n't made some folks antsy			1
time and again , tweaks to @entity10 's privacy settings have prompted user backlash , occasionally to the point that the site has reversed or modified those changes			1
according to a recent @entity236 / @entity235 poll , three out of five users say they have little or no faith that the company will protect their personal information			0
half of those who use the site daily say they would n't make a purchase through it and 57 % of all users claimed they never click on ads or other sponsored content			0
on a page about its advertising approach , @entity10 makes it clear that it never sells user data , saying that " if you do n't feel like you 're in control of who sees what you share , you probably wo n't use @entity10 as much , and you 'll share less with your friends			1
" @entity10 officials also emphasize that while advertisers can market to specific users , they do n't receive the data that was used to make the selection and never know the actual names of the people they 've reached			2
@entity10 's policy is to not actually look at user data except to check whether someone is violating the site 's terms of service			1
doubling down on user satisfaction is the most important thing @entity10 can do , @entity29 said , even if it occasionally means passing up chances to max out the amount it could earn on the data users provide			2
" for them , the user experience does come first and i think that 's the right strategy for the long term , " he said			1
" along the way , putting the user experience first makes a lot of longer - term business sense			1
" as an analyst , @entity29 is bullish on @entity10 , leading the pack with an early " buy " rating at the beginning of this month			0
with @entity10 reportedly looking at expanding into @entity286 and at monetizing its mobile app ( an untapped resource even though the majority of time on the site is now spent on mobile devices ) he expects its data - driven model to keep making money well into the future			1
" @entity10 is going to become just like search , [ which ] disrupted online advertising , " he said			2
" what @entity211 did eight years ago -- that is what @entity10 is doing now			0
the reach is unparalleled and they 're just scratching the surface			0

@entity10 's multibillion - dollar business model relies on user data
experts say the social network 's targeted advertising can be uniquely precise
if you have a @entity10 account , the company values you at $ 4.84 a year
@entity10 has to balance targeting ads , user experience , privacy concerns
