the @entity0 is on the verge of an energy renaissance			1
we need to recognize and seize the opportunity			0
this renaissance involves domestic production of natural resources ranging from clean renewables to hydrocarbons			0
in particular , domestic hydrocarbon production -- both oil and gas -- is increasing dramatically , with some experts predicting that the @entity0 could become the largest hydrocarbon producer in the word -- outstripping @entity16 and @entity17 -- by 2020			2
increased domestic production of hydrocarbons is driven by two trends			0
first , new technology is unlocking unconventional resources such as shale - derived oil and gas			0
and second , investors and policy makers are recognizing that the @entity0 still has an enormous resource base of conventional oil and gas , particularly in @entity31			1
opinion : why we should look to the @entity34 federal agencies estimate that @entity31 's @entity37 and federal waters off @entity31 's northern coast contain approximately 40 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil and more than 200 trillion cubic feet of conventional gas			1
according to the @entity43 , this region contains more oil than any comparable region located in the @entity34 , including northern @entity17			2
however , the @entity0 is lagging behind its @entity34 neighbors in developing these resources			2
this is unfortunate , because we have some of the highest environmental standards in the world and we should be setting the bar for @entity34 development			1
developing our @entity34 resources will promote our nation 's interests in many ways : securing a politically stable , long - term supply of domestic energy ; boosting @entity0 economic growth and jobs ; reducing the federal trade deficit ; and strengthening our global leadership on energy issues			1
leading academic researchers and economists in @entity31 have estimated that oil production from @entity31 's outer continental shelf will bring federal revenues of approximately $ 167 billion over 50 years , and create 55,000 jobs throughout the country			2
developing @entity0 resources in the @entity34 has the added benefit of enhancing global environmental protection			1
one of the arguments used by @entity34 drilling opponents is that " we are n't ready , " but it is obvious that no matter what preparations are made , they will argue that it is n't enough			0
@entity80 , for example , has spent billions to prepare for drilling in the @entity34 this summer , incorporating the lessons learned from the @entity84 spill in the @entity85 , state - of - the - art equipment and extensive scientific research			0
recently , the @entity89 administration has publically expressed its confidence in the company 's drilling plans			0
the @entity0 has created some of the highest standards in the world for environmental protection			1
when we delay or disallow responsible resource development , the end result is not to protect the environment , but to drive hydrocarbon investment and production to countries with much lower environmental standards and enforcement capacity			1
last year , it was reported that between 5 million and 20 million tons of oil leak in @entity17 per year			0
this is equivalent to a @entity84 blowout about every two months			0
@entity17 had an estimated 18,000 oil pipeline ruptures in 2010 -- the figure for the @entity0 that year was 341			2
if we do not pursue responsible development in the @entity34 , countries such as @entity17 -- perhaps even @entity112 , which is interested in securing access to @entity34 hydrocarbon resources -- will dominate energy production from the @entity34			1
such a scenario does not bode well for the global environment			0
by embracing the opportunities in the @entity34 , the @entity0 will show the world that it can be a strong leader in responsible energy development .			1

estimates are that @entity31 has about 40 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil
@entity128 : the @entity0 is on the verge of an energy renaissance ; we must seize the opportunity
he says we have some of the highest standards in the world for environmental protection
@entity128 : if we do not pursue responsible development in the @entity34 , other countries will
