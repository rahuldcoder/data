@entity0 , @entity1 -- seventh graders at @entity4 became an overnight sensation during the presidential election when their @entity8 performance of " @entity11 " catapulted them to online stardom			1
" the higher the expectations , the higher the results , " says @entity4 , seen here with his students			1
now , their creative and scholastic talents have proved the students to be more than just " one hit wonders			2
" @entity21 students showcased their poetry and writings for @entity2 's documentary " @entity24 , " hosted by @entity25			2
cultivating student creativity is just one of the goals of academy founder @entity4 , an enigmatic educator known for his unconventional teaching methods			1
under his strict tutelage , students at @entity4 -- who are predominantly @entity31 -- are expected to excel in all subjects and maintain a high standard of respect for their peers and teachers			1
" i 'm teaching an eighth - grade curriculum to fifth - graders , " says @entity4			1
" some people say my expectations of the kids , academically , is too high , but the higher the expectations , the higher the results			0
" but with high academic expectations come an equally high quotient for fun			0
it 's become one of @entity4 's trademarks : singing and dancing to popular rap and @entity53 songs during class to get the kids engaged			1
" my first day at @entity4 , i thought all the teachers were psychopaths , " says seventh - grader @entity55			1
" i thought @entity4 was going crazy			1
he was up in front of the kids on desks , he was dancing			0
... i never saw a teacher get up on a desk and dance			0
but now i 'm used to it , so i get up on the desk and dance too , " says @entity55			0
@entity4 , formerly a schoolteacher from @entity68 , founded the academy with money he earned from his book titled the essential 55 , which detail @entity4 's 55 golden rules for success -- in and out of the classroom			1
@entity4 was invited to be a guest on the @entity77 show after winning @entity78 in 2001			1
@entity77 believed so much in the well - mannered @entity80 school teacher from @entity68 that she encouraged him to write the book			0
later she promoted @entity82 55 on her show , prompting it 's ascension to @entity86 bestseller list			0
together with co-founder @entity87 , @entity4 transformed a decaying factory in a rough part of @entity90 , @entity1 , into a state - of - the - art educational model for middle schools across the country			1
soon after the school opened its doors in 2008 , a @entity95 package from @entity77 arrived for @entity4 in the form of a $ 365,000 grant , or " a thousand dollars for each day of the year , " as @entity77 referred to it in the letter			2
then came the elections , with a tight presidential race between sens. @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107			0
inspired by rapper @entity110 's hit song " @entity111 , " @entity4 's seventh grade class penned their own lyrics and dance moves			1
the students ' performance carried a message : cast your ballot because you support a candidate 's policies rather than just his skin color			2
when they perform the song , half the seventh grade class touts the virtues of @entity127 's @entity106 while the other half root for @entity129 @entity104 : " @entity104 on the left			0
we can talk politics all night			0
and you can vote however you like			0
" the students " can talk politics with the best of them , " says @entity4			1
video clips of the kids performing have garnered over 15 million hits on @entity8			1
" we got lots of media attention			0
but when the media arrived to the school they realized the song is not the story , it 's the kids , " says @entity4			2
one of @entity4 's credos is teaching a " global curriculum " with a heavy emphasis on current events			1
himself an avid world traveler , @entity4 believes it 's essential for his students to travel to other countries to develop an understanding and appreciation of the world in which they live			1

" i 'm not nearly as shy as i used to be , " says seventh - grader @entity166 after her first year at the academy			2
" my knowledge of the world has improved , i know more about what 's going on in other countries and i 'm more curious about things			1
... i 'm just hungry for knowledge , " says @entity166			1
in fact , the students at @entity4 are better versed in current events and politics than many adults			1
" i never thought i 'd be interested in watching the news , " says seventh - grader @entity180			0
" now i find it interesting because i have learned the stories behind the news , " he says			0
@entity180 -- who pronounces @entity187 president @entity186 's name perfectly -- says he 's interested in learning about world issues such as the @entity187 elections , the @entity190 in @entity191 , and the @entity194 - @entity193 conflict			2
" at the beginning , " says @entity4 , " the kids will say something like ' i 've been to @entity197 [ a suburb of @entity90 ]			2
after a few years they 've been to @entity199 , @entity200 , or @entity201 , or @entity202			0
... they 've become very comfortable with understanding the country and understanding themselves			0
" but it 's not just the travel or even the singing and dancing to rap music that make the school so special , say the students			2
it 's the academy teachers ' creative ways of instilling education , solid values , and a passion for learning			0
" they want you to pass the people at the top , " says @entity55			0
" to be at the top nonstop , be at your fullest , to be creative , to think out of the box			0
" but school is n't all fun and games , she says			0
@entity4 is a strict disciplinarian that expects -- and enforces -- model behavior from all of the students			1
