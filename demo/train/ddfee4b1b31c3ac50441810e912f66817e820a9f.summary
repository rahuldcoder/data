@entity0 -- @entity2 , the head of the @entity4 unit handling tax - exempt status , invoked her @entity6 right against self - incrimination before the @entity8 on wednesday			1
she is in the spotlight following a @entity12 inspector general 's report that found her unit used political criteria to screen applications for tax - exempt status from tea party and other conservative organizations			0
@entity2 joins a long line of officials who " took the @entity6 " when called to testify before @entity22			1
former @entity24 ceo @entity23 , former lobbyist @entity25 , retired lt. col. @entity26 and several @entity28 officials all invoked that privilege before @entity22 due to concerns that anything they may have said could have been used against them in court			2
here is what the fifth amendment to the @entity35 says : no person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a @entity43 , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the @entity47 , when in actual service in time of @entity49 or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation			2
what that last part -- also known as the " self - incrimination clause " -- generally means is that a witness can not be forced to make statements that he or she feels might be negative or used against them			1
the right must be affirmatively waived			0
by the numbers : @entity4 invoking the @entity6 is usually done to avoid answering specific questions			1
in @entity2 's case , the @entity28 is investigating the @entity4 saga and agency officials have faced pointed questions from lawmakers at three hearings			1
it remains unclear whether she ultimately will be compelled to testify by the @entity84 panel			0
@entity85 have questioned whether @entity2 voided her right not to testify when she read her opening statement			2
" i have not done anything wrong			0
i have not broken any laws			0
i have not violated any @entity4 rules and regulations , " she said			0
committee chairman @entity92 , @entity93 , dismissed her with a warning she could be called back .			1

@entity4 official invoked @entity6 right not to answer questions before @entity22
she joined a long line of public figures exercising right against self - incrimination
@entity2 could still be called back to testify before @entity8 committee
