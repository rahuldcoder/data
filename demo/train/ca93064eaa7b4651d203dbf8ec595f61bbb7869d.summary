@entity0 -- @entity4 newspaper and magazine publishers lost a @entity6 bid wednesday to block the progress of a government - backed royal charter on press regulation			1
the royal charter , which has cross-party backing , was due to go before the @entity13 on wednesday for approval after the @entity6 ruling			1
the industry groups that brought the unsuccessful legal challenge said they were " deeply disappointed " by the decision and would try to overturn it on appeal			1
" this is a vital constitutional issue and we will be taking our case for judicial review -- of the @entity13 's decisions on both the @entity28 and the cross-party charter -- to the @entity30 , " they said			1
the legal challenge was brought to the @entity6 by the @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , which is the industry body that funds the current press watchdog , the @entity34			2
it sought permission to seek a judicial review of the politician - backed royal charter on the grounds that the industry 's own proposed royal charter was not properly considered and that the process was " startlingly unfair			1
" the industry 's draft royal charter was rejected by the @entity13 , a body made up of government ministers , earlier this year			1
but the @entity6 ruled against the legal challenge			2
the cross-party royal charter follows months of talks between the industry and lawmakers on how to establish a system of independent press self - regulation , following an inquiry last year into press ethics led by @entity57			1
the inquiry was set up after outrage over claims of widespread phone hacking and other abuses by elements of the @entity4 press			2
a number of criminal prosecutions are being brought in relation to those claims			0
critics say the government - backed royal charter risks weakening the freedom of the press by allowing political interference , while supporters argue that the newspaper industry has failed to regulate itself effectively so far			1
' @entity76 ' the @entity77 earlier welcomed the @entity6 ruling			0
" both the industry and the government agree self - regulation of the press is the way forward and we both agree that a @entity87 is the best framework for that , " it said in a statement			2
" we are clear the process for considering the industry royal charter was robust and fair and the courts have agreed			2
we can now get on with implementing the cross-party charter			0
" a royal charter will protect @entity72 whilst offering real redress when mistakes are made			1
importantly , it is the best way of resisting full statutory regulation that others have tried to impose			0
" @entity101 deputy leader @entity100 also voiced her support for the ruling			0
" now is the time for a proper complaints system which is effective and independent of press and politicians which does not infringe the freedom of the press , " she said			0
" we need a press which is robust and free , which holds those in power to account , but which does not abuse its own power by wreaking havoc on the lives of innocent people			0
" ' good for journalism ' campaign group hacked @entity120 , which has called for tougher regulation of the press , has backed the royal charter opposed by the newspaper industry			1
" the big newspaper companies like the @entity128 and the @entity130 press have been in denial ever since the @entity133 report condemned the way they treated ordinary people and said they needed to change , " executive director @entity125 said in a statement			0
" the inquiry judge has told them this			0
their own readers -- the public -- have told them			0
their past victims have told them			0
every single party in @entity144 has told them			0
now the courts have thrown out their latest manoeuvre			0
" @entity125 said the royal charter was " good for journalism , good for freedom of speech , and -- vitally -- good for the public			2
" government interference ? the @entity31 challenge was made " in the context of a wholly unfair and irrational process leading to a recommendation and decision that has the potential profoundly to affect the nature of press regulation in this country , " according to a statement filed with the court			2
the newspaper publishers argued that they were not properly consulted about the rival royal charter , which has cross-party political support			1
they also argued that the government - backed royal charter does not guarantee @entity72 from political interference , since it can be amended with the agreement of a two - thirds majority in @entity144			1
both versions of the royal charter envisage the establishment of a " recognition panel " to oversee a self - regulatory committee that would consider complaints against the press and would have the power to impose fines of up to 1 million pounds ( $ 1.6 million ) against newspapers for wrongdoing			1
their differences hinge on how that panel is made up and on how changes can be made to the charter			0
the rejected @entity31 charter proposed that it be amended after agreement by the industry itself , while the government - backed version would be subject to a vote in @entity144			1
protecting a free press the @entity13 rejected the industry 's draft charter on the grounds that under its terms , the recognition panel would not be sufficiently independent and that it would not have sufficient powers to ensure proper redress			0
but @entity31 argues that its version of the royal charter is more likely to meet @entity57 's aim of " a genuinely independent and effective system of self - regulation , " free from government interference			1
culture secretary @entity208 told lawmakers this month that the government " must protect our free press whilst striking the right balance between independence and redress for individuals			2
" the independent @entity57 inquiry was set up by prime minister @entity218 to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public , police and politicians .			0
