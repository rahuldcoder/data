he 's a @entity1 - winning musician , with a band that 's brought in hundreds of millions of dollars from touring , and to cap it off , his latest release , " @entity5 , " just topped the @entity7 album charts			2
but @entity8 was still frightened when it came to showing his art in a professional @entity12 exhibit			1
" i 've always drawn and painted , but as my own thing , " the musician said			0
" i 've never done anything as ambitious as this			0
" the result of the singer 's ambition is " @entity25 " ( the " c " sounds like a " k " ) , an exhibition of more than 20 silk - screened works by @entity8 and close friend @entity21 at the @entity22 in @entity23			1
" i 'm very afraid of things like this , " @entity8 said			1
" for years , @entity21 has said , ' come on , let 's do something together			1
' " a fellow @entity30 , @entity21 knew just what to say to get @entity8 over his fears and into the gallery			1
" ' no one 's ever died making a painting , ' i told him , " recalled @entity21 , an artist with more than 30 years ' experience			1
the paintings , on display until april 13 , may have taken only two weeks to complete , but they reveal some of the singer 's personal feelings to the world , according to @entity8			1
he says his favorite piece , covered with meticulous etchings , displays his compulsive side while other works show his hatred for the poaching of the @entity30 rhino			0
the art is not all serious			0
like classic @entity8 lyrics , there are works celebrating the idea of " eat , drink and be merry			1
" the " fat man , " an alter ego for @entity21 , appears as an explorer in many of the pieces			2
" i just ca n't get enough of him			0
when we did anything , i 'd say , ' let 's put the fat man on it , ' " @entity8 said			2
" i wo n't apologize for the fat man			0
i wo n't apologize for the fact that we used him so much			0
" @entity8 said getting over this first artistic hump might open the floodgates for more art shows			1
" of the points in my life that i 'll look back on as monumental to me , this will definitely be one , " he said			0
the famous singer might be ok with his mug all over tv and film , but he apparently is a bit apprehensive when it comes to his face on his art. one piece has his face plastered more than 20 times throughout			2
the work @entity86 sequestered in the back , and @entity8 joked about it coming to an untimely end			2
" i hate it , " he said			0
" if there 's a fire in the building , leave that s * * t in ! "			0
