@entity0 -- @entity3 's oldest hotel chain has waded into the debate on the slaughter of sharks for their fins by taking the @entity9 delicacy off its menus			1
from january , diners wo n't be offered shark 's fin products at the luxury @entity15 chain , due to a decision by its owners , the @entity20 group			1
" by removing shark fin from our menus , we hope that our decision can contribute to preserving the marine ecosystem for the world 's future generations , " the group 's chief executive officer @entity21 announced in a brief press statement			2
around 73 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year , taking one in three shark species to the brink of extinction			1
their fins are hacked off at sea and the carcass discarded in the water in a practice referred to as " finning			2
" @entity15 can be found in @entity0 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			2
one is due to open in @entity47 in 2013			0
shark 's fin is only offered in its @entity3 restaurants , mostly on banquet menus for weddings and large business meetings			1
the group says its decision is not based on consultation with guests , but since last april the chain has been offering banquet clients an alternative menu , substituting shark 's fin soup with another fish soup			1
the uptake has been " quite good , " according to group spokeswoman @entity65			0
however , she could n't say whether the guests ' decision was motivated by a desire to save the shark , or by the hotel 's offer of one night 's free accommodation if they took the second option			1
" i think it 's actually both , " she said			0
@entity75 's fin is a popular dish among @entity9 diners who appreciate its texture , if not its flavor , in soup			0
once a delicacy favored by emperors , shark fin is often eaten at weddings to mark the importance of the occasion and impress the couple 's extended families and friends			2
however , @entity91 says the hotel group has noticed a generational split between diners who want the specialty seafood and those prepared to do without			0
" what we 've found is that in recent years the younger generation , the couples who are getting married would prefer to steer away from shark 's fin			1
but for their parents or in - laws would prefer to have the shark fin , " @entity91 says			0
@entity0 is a major hub for the global shark fin trade , handling at least 50 % of the total haul , according to the @entity109 's @entity108			2
crusted , pointy fins can be seen in the windows of stores in the city 's dried food sector			2
most come from @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , the @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
last year , @entity125 launched a campaign -- alternative shark - free menu -- to persuade @entity0 restaurants and caterers to offer alternatives to shark 's fin on their banquet menus			1
" at first it was very difficult			0
they almost kicked us out when we went to meet them to explain the program , " says @entity135 from the @entity125			0
just one year later , 97 caterers and hotels have signed up , with some going further and limiting their menus to sustainable seafood			0
@entity135 says the program 's success , and the @entity147 's ban , indicates that a " tipping point " is being reached in the campaign against shark fin products			1
" i 'm quite confident that more and more restaurants will follow their lead			0
i 'm quite optimistic because if such a prestige hotel chain can satisfy their consumers , i 'm pretty sure that they see that the market is changing , " @entity135 says .			1
