-- news of a recent meningitis outbreak has sent many @entity3 into panic mode			1
as of thursday afternoon , 170 people in 11 states had become sick with the noncontagious fungal meningitis ; 14 of those have died			1
health officials expect those numbers to rise as the investigation continues			0
the cases have been linked to injections of contaminated steroid medication made by the @entity15 - based @entity14			1
" i 'll be skipping my allergy shot , " @ @entity18 tweeted			0
" maybe this is crazy but ever since the meningitis outbreak i am scare ( d ) to get a flu shot even ( thinking ) it will be contaminated , " @entity19 posted on @entity20			1
the @entity24 said thursday as many as 14,000 people may have received the contaminated steroid injections			1
health officials have been able to contact about 90 % of those to warn them			1
the idea that a medication created to fix health problems could potentially harm people is frightening , especially when that medication was contaminated in something called a compounding center			1
typically medications are mass - produced by drug manufacturing companies			0
so what 's a compounding center , and why are we getting our medications from it ? compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual 's needs			1
doctors prescribe these custom medications when the manufactured drug wo n't work -- for example , when a dosage is too large , or a patient has an allergy to a dye or ingredient in the original product			0
pharmaceutical compounding is a common practice , said @entity59 , executive vice president and ceo of the @entity61			1
in fact , compounding is the way all medications were made up until about the 1950s , when mass manufacturing of medications began			1
" that was the only way that medications could be filled for people -- having pharmacists making it from scratch , " @entity59 said			2
meningitis outbreak : your questions answered now compounding pharmacists work in pharmacy centers like the @entity14 , in hospitals , in small independent drugstores , and in drugstore chains like @entity81 or @entity82 across the country			1
but only 1 % to 3 % of all prescriptions currently dispensed in the @entity3 are compounded , according to the @entity61			1
dr. @entity85 , a pediatrician in @entity86 , said she regularly writes prescriptions for compounded medications for her child patients			1
sometimes it 's to ask the pharmacist to turn a manufactured pill into liquid form so children can take it easily			0
other times the compounding pharmacist adds a flavor to the medication to make it more appealing			2
" that 's just our only option , " @entity85 said , " unless you want to sneak it into their food			0
" hospitals often ask for compounded drugs to receive the correct dosage for specific surgeries			2
if the manufactured bottle contains too much , they would have to waste the rest of the medication since the sterilized seal has been broken			0
compounding pharmacists also work for veterinary practices			2
many of the same medications we take can be customized for our pets or the animals in zoos			0
@entity122 , an associate professor of health law and bioethics at @entity125 , said there 's been a recent increase in reliance on compounding pharmacies in the @entity3			1
physicians and clinics are increasingly getting material from compounding pharmacies because they can sell drugs at a lower cost than major manufacturers , he said			2
compounding pharmacies usually make only a couple of doses for a specific patient , which can lower the cost of production			2
of course , the opposite can also be true -- if the compound is a complex cancer drug , producing just a few doses would be exponentially more expensive than mass production			0
@entity59 said compounding pharmacies also fill gaps when there 's a drug shortage			2
as drug companies struggle to keep up with orders , or when they stop producing altogether because they 're not seeing a profit , these pharmacies can access the raw drug ingredients and provide the medications for patients who are already in midtreatment			0
one question the outbreak has raised is why and how a compounding pharmacy was shipping out medications to 23 states			1
did all 75 facilities that received the contaminated steroid injections have prescriptions filled for the medication ? or was the @entity14 acting as a manufacturer ? one woman 's fight for compounding pharmacy guidelines " the saddest part about this is that there were so many doses administered , " @entity59 said			1
" ( @entity176 ) takes up to a month to a month and a half to develop			0
we 've got patients who may have been exposed who are literally waiting to see if anything happens			0
as a pharmacist , that really upsets me personally , and it upsets my entire profession			0
" on wednesday , @entity15 gov. @entity186 accused the @entity14 of misleading regulators and operating outside its license by shipping large batches of drugs nationwide			0
and the state pharmacy board took the step of requiring all compounding pharmacies in @entity15 to sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients			2
with so many questions still unanswered , the public 's worries about allergy shots , flu shots and other prescription medications are understandable , @entity59 said			0
unfortunately , this kind of contamination could happen with any drug -- manufactured or compounded			2
yet the vast majority are perfectly safe , @entity59 said , and patients should n't avoid a needed medication out of fear			0
however , he said , patients should feel free to ask their doctor or pharmacist : where does this drug come from ? meningitis outbreak highlights failed oversight efforts @entity0 's @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 contributed to this report .			0
