those who have been following the recent soap opera at the @entity2 may think that it has to do with the blundering dismissal of the president , @entity5 , and her subsequent re-engagement by the @entity8 under instruction by the governor of the state to put their house in order or resign			1
in fact , the heart of the drama is not about the president			2
nor is it about the board			2
rather , it is about the principle stakeholders of the @entity2 and @entity23 higher education in general			1
those who recall the campus disruptions protesting the @entity27 will remember a slogan of the time , " @entity29			0
" it was meant to be a challenge of the " rulers " by the " masses			0
" in 2012 in @entity35 , @entity36 , we see a similar confrontation			0
but in place of chanting " close the university , " on this occasion the students , faculty and others assembled on the quad claimed the right to open the university as their own and called for the right to select their own leader -- their own president			1
in the @entity27 era , the students and faculty saw the university as an alien complicit in " the war , " something to be overthrown			1
in today 's story , the students and faculty are saying that they are the university , an entity to be protected from a seemingly intrusive force : the @entity8			1
these campus constituents who are sometimes called " members of the academy " or " the university community " had the benefit of @entity5 's leadership for only two years , a period traditionally considered far too brief for any group to develop strong feelings of loyalty and attachment			1
it was not @entity5 personally they were invested in but rather what she represented			1
they were offended at being neither consulted nor appropriately informed when she was dispatched without due process or even a persuasive bill of particulars			0
it was the crime of insult			1
by ignoring the faculty and students , the board showed a disregard for their standing , and that is perceived as a critical act of rudeness			1
the issue comes down to participatory democracy			1
@entity5 is the icon of the encounter			1
when the president was furtively fired without a legitimate process , we witnessed a back - of - the - hand slap by @entity93			2
the rehiring of the president after a special emergency meeting of the board is a victory for the president , of course , but more significant , it is a victory for the concept of a governance system in which all parties who have a genuine interest in the maintenance of the university are given an opportunity to play their part , to express their thinking and have it inform the future of their institution			1
what we see here is the reaffirmation of a social contract that has been in place at a great university devised and established by @entity121 in 1819			0
in life , substance matters , and it does so equally on campus , in business or in government			0
but process is also important			0
how things are done reflect our values			0
in the case at the @entity2 , the leader of the board , @entity134 , was exposed as having disregarded " the way we do things			1
" this is no small matter at an institution like the @entity2 , with its defining student @entity142			2
the action of the board was a gaffe and a blunder			2
@entity134 miscalculated how a slight can inspire a protest movement			0
i can not help to think how ironic it is that this battle has two women in opposition , @entity5 and @entity152			2
would this have been possible before the passage of @entity154 in 1972 , a major contributor in articulating the women 's movement ? many lessons will be drawn , articles written , perhaps even a book worth reading about one of the most consequential academic battles of 2012			0
gender equity is far from complete on college campuses , but it has made a good start			0
in this case , the fact that the media have not made much about the women in the showdown demonstrates how far we have come in contemporary @entity23			0
twenty - five years ago , this would have been called a catfight			0
today , it is merely a political battle .			0

@entity2 *reinstated* its president , @entity5 , after she was fired
@entity179 : by ignoring stakeholders , board committed the crime of insult
he says the board showed a disregard for the standing of faculty and students
