-- @entity2 's war against the drug cartels is frustrated by a risk - averse army and interagency rivalries , according to @entity7 diplomatic cables obtained by @entity8			1
but amid some downbeat assessments of the challenges faced by president @entity11 , some of the cables celebrate outstanding successes against the cartel " capos			1
" one such success came almost exactly a year ago , when a @entity2 naval unit killed one of @entity2 's leading cartel figures , @entity21 -- with plenty of assistance from the @entity7			1
" the arrest operation targeting @entity25 began about a week prior to his death when the @entity28 relayed detailed information on his location to @entity32 [ @entity32 ] , " according to a cable sent soon after the operation			2
the naval unit " raided an identified location , where they killed several @entity25 bodyguards and arrested over 23 associates , while @entity25 and @entity41 [ his brother ] escaped			0
" but time was running out for @entity21 ( also known as @entity44 and @entity45 ) , thanks to @entity7 surveillance			1
the cable continues : " the @entity28 interagency linked @entity25 to an apartment building located in @entity51 ( about an hour south of @entity52 ) , where @entity25 was in hiding ...			0
@entity25 's forces fired on the @entity32 operatives and engaged in a sustained firefight that wounded three @entity32 marines and possibly killed one			0
" besides @entity21 , at least three other cartel operatives were killed during the dec. 16 , 2009 , raid , with a fourth committing suicide			2
the success of the operation was especially pleasing to the @entity7 because its military had spent years training @entity2 naval units			1
some might question why the navy was involved in a land operation			0
this and other cables provide the answer : the army had declined to act quickly on information about @entity21 's whereabouts and is described as " risk averse			1
" after the @entity21 operation , there was glowing praise from @entity7 diplomats for @entity2 navy units			1
" @entity32 is well - trained , well - equipped , and has shown itself capable of responding quickly to actionable intelligence , " a cable read			0
" success puts the @entity82 in the difficult position of explaining why it has been reluctant to act on good intelligence and conduct operations against high - level targets			0
" there is no euphoria about @entity21 's demise , but the embassy hopes it will mark a new beginning			2
" his death will not solve @entity2 's drug problem , but it will hopefully generate the momentum necessary to make sustained progress against other drug trafficking organizations			2
" since @entity21 's death , @entity2 security forces have scored some significant successes in arresting or killing leading cartel members , and often @entity32 units have been in the vanguard			1
last month the @entity104 confirmed its forces shot and killed @entity106 , alias " @entity106 , " one of the top members of the @entity110 cartel			0
and , in january this year , there seemed to be optimism that some of the institutional challenges were at last being tackled			0
" a truly joint effort to implement a new @entity7 - @entity2 strategy is yielding stronger organizational structures and interagency cooperation on both sides and a deeper understanding of the threat posed by the drug trafficking organizations , " reads one cable			1
the same cable noted that the @entity82 [ @entity125 ] had for the first time asked the @entity7 for special forces training			2
" we need to capitalize on these cracks in the door			0
any retreat on engagement on our side will only reinforce @entity125 's instincts to revert to a closed and unaccountable institution			0
