there are only nine months left to get that flying car designed and in production			2
the @entity4 has reminded us of the very specific vision " @entity7 " had for october 21 , 2015			1
flying cars zipping through the air , auto - drying clothes that fit to your body , shoes that lace up on their own and time travel are all the norm when @entity16 and his girlfriend , @entity17 , played by @entity18 and @entity19 , land in that year			1
and do n't even get us started on the fact that we still do n't have time travel			0
the 1989 film did highlight a few technologies that are currently in our present -- or at least similar items			2
@entity28 has a video call with his coworker and boss , people are able to answer the phone with glasses that are very much like @entity35 glass , and of course hoverboards do exist , though they 're not as cool or as high - flying as in the movie			1
there 's also no " @entity7 , " but we do have @entity40 movies and holograms , as seen on the screen			0
as for flying cars , there is the @entity45 and the @entity46 , but do n't count on coasting the friendly skies in those anytime soon , especially using banana peels and such for fuel			1
futurist @entity51 told @entity52 the movie did get a few things right			2
" three definite hits : biometrics , large screen home displays , video telephone calls , " @entity51 said			0
" @entity59 and @entity60 are part of everyday usage ; by the end of the decade i think it will be totally natural for younger users to transition from text to audio to video in a single call , depending on the content at the moment			0
" you still have a wait , however , for things like hydrated pizza .			0

in the film , @entity16 traveled to october 21 , 2015
