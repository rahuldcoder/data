@entity0 -- the @entity2 is giving its airport checkpoint officers a new tool : a kit to test for explosive powders			1
if the x-ray machine detects a potentially hazardous powder , a sample will be mixed with a solution for testing			1
the @entity2 said tuesday it is deploying the kits to all @entity14 airports this week , but said it will have little noticeable impact on passengers			1
travelers can still board planes with powders such as baby formula , makeup and medicines			0
" the majority of passengers wo n't notice any difference in checkpoint procedures , " said @entity2 spokeswoman @entity23			2
" this is just one additional layer of security that helps bolster our explosive detection capability			0
" while there is no specific threat at this time involving explosive powders , the new kits will help protect against the possibility that terrorists could board a plane and use the powder as a component in an improvised explosive device , the @entity2 said			1
in practice , the initial screening process will not change			1
passengers will still pass their carry - on bags through an x-ray machine			1
but if the x-ray machine detects a potentially hazardous powder , the powder container will be removed , a small sample will be taken and the sample will be mixed with a solution for testing			1
during pilot tests late last year , a " very small percentage " of the baggage stream required additional tests , said @entity59 , who declined to give specific numbers , citing security concerns			0
the vast majority of common powders -- infant formula , medication and makeup -- did not need additional screening , she said			0
if powder does need another level of screening , it will be done in a way that avoids contamination of the product , and passengers will be made aware of the test , she said			0
any powder determined to be a potential threat will not be permitted into the secure area			0
in the past , transportation security officers had to rely on @entity2 explosive specialists or local law enforcement to check out powders that required additional screening			2
the kits cost an average of $ 145 each , the @entity2 said			2
three years ago , the @entity2 and its counterparts overseas imposed severe restrictions on the amount of liquids passengers could carry on planes after @entity93 authorities uncovered a plot to use flammable liquids to destroy at least seven transatlantic airliners			2
those restrictions remain in place			0
on monday , a @entity93 court convicted three men in the 2006 plot .			0

@entity2 kits will allow testing for explosive powders
the agency said the testing will have little noticeable impact on passengers
the initial carry - on screening process will not change
potentially hazardous powders will be mixed with a solution for testing
