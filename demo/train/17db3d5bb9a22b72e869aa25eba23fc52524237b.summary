-- @entity1 can no longer read , drive a car or even recognize faces			1
but the 20 - year - old , who lost his central vision two years ago , can successfully hit a small white ball into a slightly larger hole from considerable distance			1
chipping from off the green at a tournament in august , the @entity9 won a nerve - wracking playoff to officially become the world 's best blind golfer			1
poincenot , a college student from @entity16 , has an extremely rare disease called @entity19 's hereditary optic neuropathy ( @entity20 )			1
and not long ago , he feared he 'd never play golf again			1
he woke up the day before @entity22 in 2008 to notice his formerly perfect vision was a little blurry			1
a routine trip to the optometrist to pick up a pair of glasses ended up with him being diagnosed with a suspected brain tumor			0
the subsequent holidays were spent having an mri scan , a spinal tap and then a catheter placed in his jugular as doctors struggled to diagnose the cause of his vanishing sight			0
it was n't until his mother discovered it on the internet that @entity1 was successfully diagnosed with @entity20 -- a hereditary disease with no treatment and no cure that only affects one in 50,000 people			1
@entity48 has since set up the website @entity50 to support fellow sufferers and their families , and to help raise funds for the @entity54 , where dr. @entity55 is researching a cure			0
faced with the onset of blindness , @entity1 admits he slipped into depression for a couple of months until one afternoon he was jerked back into action			1
" i saw this guy who had just lost his wife and baby daughter when a plane crashed down on his house , " he told @entity0			0
" the guy was in a press conference crying , saying ' if anybody knows how to handle something this tragic , please tell me			0
' i just thought , ' hey if this guy can make it through this then i can survive having no central vision			1
' that became my motto : ' things could be worse			0
' " so six months after losing his sight , @entity48 decided to pick up his clubs again			2
a keen golfer with a handicap of just four , he had played every sunday since the age of 12 with his @entity86 , a club engineer at golf firm @entity87			2
blind golf brought them even closer because , unlike the regular version of the sport , it 's a team game			1
@entity92 acts as his son 's sighted coach on the course , describing the hole he 's playing , the bunkers , the water hazards and the dog - legs -- as well as adjusting his son 's feet and club - face alignment before every shot			1
then he 'll point in the direction that the shot should be played , while @entity1 places his chin on his dad 's shoulder to get a sense of the correct alignment			1
" he 's the one who does all the work , lining me up and reading the putts -- i 'm just the one who executes the shots , " @entity1 laughs			1
they played their first tournament together in @entity117 , and then qualified from the nationals in @entity119 despite a few teething problems			2
" he forgot to tell me about a few bunkers , and i was n't as nice to him as i should have been , " @entity1 recalls			1
but before the @entity124 's @entity123 began in @entity125 in august , @entity1 made a pact with his dad : " we realized that our attitude needed to improve as a team , so we decided to focus more on having fun rather than stressing out about every shot			1
" the new approach clearly worked , because at the end of the first day , @entity48 was tied for third out of 60 competitors and just one shot away from the leader			0
" the whole second day , my stomach was in my throat -- i was extremely nervous on every shot , " he admits			0
" but i think @entity86 was even more nervous than me ; after i take my shot he 's freaking out watching my ball go towards the rough , while i ca n't even tell			2
" nevertheless , @entity48 still managed to shoot 89 for a net score of 70 , tying him with @entity125 champion @entity143			0
a playoff hole was then required to find the winner			0
" i hit my third shot short of the green			0
@entity143 also hit his second short of the green but i got a stroke on the hole because i 'm a ' @entity151 ' and @entity143 's a ' @entity152 ' , " he said			2
not every competitor has the same degree of visual impairment , so a three - tier handicap system is used to level the playing field			2
those who are completely blind are @entity159 , while those -- like @entity48 -- with up to six percent of vision are @entity162			2
@entity143 , who has 10 percent of his vision , is a @entity152 -- the category of player with the most sight			2
despite this potential disadvantage , however , the international business major from @entity168 had saved the best for last			0
" i paced the shot to work out the yardage , and when i got to the pin there was a crowd there watching so i thought , ' you know what , i 'm not going to be in this situation many times in my life , ' so i waved to the crowd real quick and then got back to my shot			0
" i took what i thought was a nice chip and even heard someone in the crowd say , ' that 's a nice chip			0
' then i heard the ball hit the pin and fall into the hole			0
my dad shouted , ' it went in ! ' so i threw my hat in the air and gave my dad a big hug			0
" as well as winning his first @entity198 , @entity48 has been raising money and awareness of @entity20 with sponsored bike rides , half - marathons and even sky dives			1
he is now setting his ambitions on the next tournament in @entity207 's @entity206 in 2012			1
" to be able to share being world champion with my dad is incredible , i do n't know if it 's hit me yet , " he says			0
" it 's a great feeling and i hope it will help raise awareness of @entity20 , because that 's the greater purpose of why i do anything			0

@entity215 wins @entity198 two years after losing his vision
@entity1 feared he 'd never play golf again after being blinded by rare disease
the 20 - year - old is *joined* on the golf course by his father , who acts as his son 's eyes
he is now setting his sights on the next tournament in @entity207 in 2012
