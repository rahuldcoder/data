-- terrorism causes fear , and we overreact to that fear			2
our brains are n't very good at probability and risk analysis			2
we tend to exaggerate spectacular , strange and rare events , and downplay ordinary , familiar and common ones			1
we think rare risks are more common than they are , and we fear them more than probability indicates we should			2
our leaders are just as prone to this overreaction as we are			2
but aside from basic psychology , there are other reasons that it 's smart politics to exaggerate terrorist threats , and security threats in general			1
the first is that we respond to a strong leader			0
@entity22 famously said : " when people feel uncertain , they 'd rather have somebody that 's strong and wrong than somebody who 's weak and right			1
the second is that doing something -- anything -- is good politics			1
a politician wants to be seen as taking charge , demanding answers , fixing things			1
it just does n't look as good to sit back and claim that there 's nothing to do			1
the logic is along the lines of : " something must be done			0
therefore , we must do it			0
" the third is that the " fear preacher " wins , regardless of the outcome			0
one of them preaches fear and draconian security measures			1
the other is someone like me , who tells people that terrorism is a negligible risk , that risk is part of life , and that while some security is necessary , we should mostly just refuse to be terrorized and get on with our lives			1
fast - forward 10 years			0
if i 'm right and there have been no more terrorist attacks , the fear preacher takes credit for keeping us safe			1
but if a terrorist attack has occurred , my government career is over			1
even if the incidence of terrorism is as ridiculously low as it is today , there 's no benefit for a politician to take my side of that gamble			1
the fourth and final reason is money			0
every new security technology , from surveillance cameras to high - tech fusion centers to airport full - body scanners , has a for - profit corporation lobbying for its purchase and use			1
given the three other reasons above , it 's easy -- and probably profitable -- for a politician to make them happy and say yes			1
for any given politician , the implications of these four reasons are straightforward			2
overestimating the threat is better than underestimating it			0
doing something about the threat is better than doing nothing			0
doing something that is explicitly reactive is better than being proactive			0
( if you 're proactive and you 're wrong , you 've wasted money			0
if you 're proactive and you 're right but no longer in power , whoever is in power is going to get the credit for what you did			0
) visible is better than invisible			0
creating something new is better than fixing something old			0
those last two maxims are why it 's better for a politician to fund a terrorist fusion center than to pay for more @entity115 translators for the @entity116			1
no one 's going to see the additional appropriation in the @entity116 's secret budget			2
on the other hand , a high - tech computerized fusion center is going to make front page news , even if it does n't actually do anything useful			0
this leads to another phenomenon about security and government			1
once a security system is in place , it can be very hard to dislodge it			1
imagine a politician who objects to some aspect of airport security : the liquid ban , the shoe removal , something			1
if he pushes to relax security , he gets the blame if something bad happens as a result			2
no one wants to roll back a police power and have the lack of that power cause a well - publicized death , even if it 's a one - in - a - billion fluke			2
we 're seeing this force at work in the bloated terrorist no - fly and watch lists ; agents have lots of incentive to put someone on the list , but absolutely no incentive to take anyone off			2
we 're also seeing this in the @entity162 's attempt to reverse the ban on small blades on airplanes			2
twice it tried to make the change , and twice fearful politicians prevented it from going through with it			0
lots of unneeded and ineffective security measures are perpetrated by a government bureaucracy that is primarily concerned about the security of its members ' careers			1
they know the voters are more likely to punish them more if they fail to secure against a repetition of the last attack , and less if they fail to anticipate the next one			0
what can we do ? well , the first step toward solving a problem is recognizing that you have one			0
these are not iron - clad rules ; they 're tendencies			0
if we can keep these tendencies and their causes in mind , we 're more likely to end up with sensible security measures that are commensurate with the threat , instead of a lot of security theater and draconian police powers that are not			1
our leaders ' job is to resist these tendencies			0
our job is to support politicians who do resist			0
