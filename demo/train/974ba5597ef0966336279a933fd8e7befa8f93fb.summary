@entity0 , @entity1 -- dr. @entity3 , @entity2 's chief medical correspondent , withdrew his name from consideration as surgeon general of the @entity7 on thursday			1
he spoke to @entity2 's @entity8 about the decision and president @entity11 's health care plans			1
here is an edited transcript : dr. @entity3 says he just returned from @entity14 , where he looked into medical tourism			1
@entity8 : but , first , breaking news about @entity2 's own dr. @entity3 , long rumored to be the main candidate for @entity7 surgeon general			1
he 's taken himself out of the running			2
joins us now here in @entity0 to talk about it			2
why ? dr. @entity3 : well , first of all , it was a really tough decision , and a long decision and a long process for sure			1
and i was incredibly flattered , humbled by the consideration even for the position			2
i think for me it really came down to a sense of timing more than anything else			1
you know , i have two daughters			2
our third daughter is now imminent			2
in fact , i have my phone on right here , i might get called off the set			2
@entity8 : as we talk			2
@entity3 : as we talk , my wife is imminent with our third child			1
you know , this job that we have collectively takes us away from our children for so many years at once , and i sort of came to grips with the fact that i 'd probably be away at least the first several years , four or five years -- there 's my existing two daughters , one more on the way -- but several years of their lives			1
and i just did n't feel like i should do that now			2
and the other thing , let me just add , you know , you know me and a lot of people know me , obviously , as a journalist for @entity2 , but you know , i continue to practice neurosurgery , @entity59			2
you and i have talked about that , and @entity62			2
. @entity8 : you do brain surgery all the time			2
and it 's an important part of my life			2
and i work at a county hospital			2
that 's the hospital i 've chosen to work at in @entity69 [ @entity70 ]			2
and i really enjoy that			2
i came to grips with , ironically , that being surgeon general , i probably would not be able to continue to practice surgery			0
@entity8 : how about the cut in pay ? @entity3 : well , you know , that 's a sacrifice we were willing to make			1
i think , you know , either you 're a public servant or you 're not a public servant			0
i 've always been drawn to public service			0
so that really was n't a consideration for me			0
@entity8 : was it an offer or a " would you consider if " ? @entity3 : it 's a little bit of a funny thing -- and i 've never been through this process before			1
i guess the formal part of it is when you are nominated			0
i was not nominated , but i had conversations with the senior-most people that would make an offer , and they told me they wanted me to do this job			1
so ... @entity8 : was it the thought of [ @entity102 former ] sen. @entity103 , who was going to be secretary of health , that you be his surgeon general ? @entity3 : well , i did have conversations with him , but you know , the fact that he withdrew did not play as big a role in my mind in terms of not considering the job			1
again , i think either you do public service or you do n't			0
you want your job to be as precisely defined as possible , for sure , but that was n't a major factor			1
@entity8 : the way it was presented , then , you feel that you would have been offered it even if @entity103 had not left or had left , no matter what ? @entity3 : i think so			1
you know , i mean , you know , i 've had a lot of conversations with the @entity126 folks			0
i think there was a big interest on their part , and obviously they know of my dedication to public service			0
i think there was a real melding there			0
@entity8 : do you have anyone you would recommend for that job ? @entity3 : you know , no one off the top of my head			1
i mean , i think whoever takes that job really does have to make it a higher - profile job			1
i mean , this is an important job			1
i have a great deal of respect for the office and for the commissioned corps			0
you 've seen the work they do			0
they do life - saving ... @entity8 : a lot of clout			0
@entity3 : yes , a lot of clout , life - saving , life - preventing work -- or life - preserving work -- all over the country every single day			1
and i think that it has to have a little bit of a higher profile			0
whoever takes this job has to be out there really advocating the issues of public health			1
at no time is it probably more important than right now , as we 're dealing with health care reform			1
these issues really go hand in hand			0
@entity8 : well , their loss is a continuing our gain			0
@entity3 : i appreciate that			1
@entity8 : if i may speak to it			0
@entity3 : i would miss this witty banter for sure , back and forth			1
@entity8 : may i speak for @entity2			0
but you had to be flattered			0
@entity3 : i was flattered			1
and you know , i have a great deal of respect for that office			0
and @entity188 in no way want people to think that i do n't			0
this is really more about my family and my surgical career			1
@entity8 : couple other notes			0
i know you 're just back from @entity14			0
i want to ask about that			0
@entity8 : president @entity11 held a health care summit [ thursday ] at the @entity126			1
more than 100 experts , policy makers took part , including some who opposed the @entity204 administration 's health care reform back in the ' 90s			1
do you support his aims ? @entity3 : he is drawing an inextricable relationship between the economy and health care			1
as people talk -- the economy is issue no. 1 , as we talk about all the time			0
but he 's making the point , i think , and he has been for some time , even while he was campaigning , that you can not talk about the economy without talking about health care			1
the businesses have to provide health care insurance for their employees			1
it is often very difficult for them to do that , in addition to trying to reach some sort of profit from their product			0
so i -- that message , i think , has been pretty loud and clear , and i think it is resonating			0
he 's also talking about the fact that you ca n't fix the health care system without bringing down costs of health care overall			1
and since you brought it up , i was just in @entity14 , and one of the stories that i was doing was about medical tourism			0
here is a good example -- 750,000 @entity7 leave the @entity7 every year to go abroad for life - saving operations			0
why ? mainly because of cost			0
it can be up to a tenth of the cost in some of these countries such as @entity14 , such as @entity249			0
@entity8 : open - heart surgery in @entity14 might be one - tenth of what it costs here ? @entity3 : one - tenth			1
all -- a lot of these various operations			0
and the real question , and i think it 's a question worth exploring , is why ? how can they do it so much cheaper ? how can they offer good - quality care ? i saw it			1
it is good - quality care			2
i saw that with my own eyes			0
what do we have to learn ? and how can we use this to help reform our health care system ? @entity8 : is there an assumption that we have the best doctors , that we do it better than anybody else , that 's an @entity7 assumption ? @entity3 : yes			1
and i think , you know , we do provide very good health care for people who have access to it			1
@entity3 : and i think that 's part of the problem			1
@entity8 : that 's the rub , though , right ? @entity3 : that is the rub			1
and i think there are really two schools of thought , which we are going to hopefully distill down , as we talk about this issue more and more			0
one is , do you revamp the entire health care system ? do you say , look , this health care system is broken , toss it all out , let 's start all over again ? or do you say , look , it works pretty well for a fraction of the population			1
let 's see who it does n't work for and fix those things only			0
so do n't throw the baby out with the bath water			0
let 's target what 's broken and focus on that			0
@entity8 : what role in all of this will the new surgeon general play ? @entity3 : i really do n't know			1
at one point ... @entity8 : he would have to be a proponent for it , you would think			0
@entity3 : you know , the surgeon general has an interesting position , and this is something that i learned			1
it is truly one of the more apolitical positions at that senior level			0
so they are really the nation 's doctor			0
i think that they really have to focus on making sure that best health practices are constantly known			2
it 's amazing how high the health illiteracy rate remains in this country			2
to remind people how to best take care of themselves			2
@entity8 : one other thing			0
do you think it 's going to -- do you think we 're going to get a new health care program ? @entity3 : i think so			1
it 's going to take a long time			2
i think that it may not even happen within this first term , if there is a second term for him			0
so i think it 's not going to be something that happens certainly overnight			0
the fact that they had a health care summit this early on i think is probably a good sign of at least his commitment to this issue .			1
