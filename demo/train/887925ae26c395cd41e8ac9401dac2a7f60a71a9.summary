-- as his family , friends and co-stars mourn the loss of " @entity8 " star @entity7 , there looms a very real issue for the popular series			1
how will the show handle the death of the man who portrayed one of its most beloved characters ? @entity7 , 31 , was found dead saturday in a @entity18 hotel room			1
the actor portrayed @entity21 , a high school quarterback whose love affair with glee club diva @entity23 was a central plot in the show and also spun off a real life romance between @entity7 and his co-star @entity27			1
with @entity7 's passing , @entity28 noted that the show 's writers " will consider what to do about the first two episodes in which the return of @entity7 's character was to have played an important part			2
" " the first two episodes of the fifth season had been written before the traditional long summer hiatus , in order to get a jump on the new season ; production had been scheduled to start next week , " the site reported			0
" the return of @entity7 's character , hunky high school football star turned glee club darling @entity21 , was much anticipated by fans , @entity7 having been absent from the final episodes of last season to check himself into a drug treatment facility late last march			2
" " @entity8 " creator @entity51 has never been one to shy away from either controversy or weaving real life drama into his shows which have included " @entity55 , " " @entity56 " and the now canceled " @entity57			1
" in april , " @entity8 " was criticized after airing an episode about a school shooting in the wake of the @entity59 tragedy in @entity62 , @entity63			1
that " glee " will address the tragedy is not in doubt , but how it will remains to be seen			0
remembering @entity7 as @entity21 it wo n't be the first television show to have to address the loss of a major character			1
most recently , @entity75 's " @entity76 " lost @entity71 who had played the iconic @entity72 in both the original series and @entity75 's reboot			0
that series decided to take his death in november 2012 from complications from cancer as an opportunity for a creative story line that would both address the beloved @entity71 's death and thrill fans			1
" @entity71 's death was terribly sad and sudden and we 'd certainly rather make the show with him than without him , " co-star @entity85 told @entity86			1
" that said , i think the writers really came up with a brilliant way to cope with the loss			0
it could have ruined the show and derailed everyone , but instead they made the best of it and actually came up with some really great stuff			0
" when actor @entity102 died of an aortic dissection in 2003 while filming his popular series " @entity105 , " @entity101 incorporated his character 's death into the show and brought in actors @entity109 and @entity111			1
the show was eventually canceled in 2005			0
while @entity7 was not the main star of the ensemble cast of " @entity8 , " his character was a central one and a fan favorite			2
writing for vulture , @entity118 said " the loss of @entity21 alters the show 's landscape permanently and irrevocably			2
" " whenever @entity8 has been at a loss for story in the past , it 's circled back to three key relationships : @entity127 and @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , and @entity21 and @entity23 , " @entity118 said			1
" @entity7 's death and @entity133 ' ( who played cheerleader @entity129 ) departure further destabilize a show already on shaky ground as it struggles to take on a more mature tone following the graduation of several of its main characters from high school			2
" having concluded season four , " @entity8 " has grappled with lower ratings and ingratiating new characters into the hearts of fans			1
when @entity7 's character along with several others graduated , new actors @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 were introduced			0
even before @entity7 's death , it was announced that the new group would be bumped up to regulars in season five , while original stars @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity133 and @entity156 would have reduced roles			2
it was also recently revealed that " @entity165 " runner - up @entity162 would be joining the show			0
there is already fan speculation as to how " @entity8 " should handle the tragedy			1
might the new group of students be pushed more to the forefront in the wake of the loss of @entity7 ? @entity174 , a writer from @entity175 which bills itself as being " for fans , by fans , " suggested that producers could do anything from allowing @entity21 a happy ending off screen to " breaking the fourth wall " and directly addressing the audience			1
" of course you could argue that there is no ' good ' or ' right ' way to handle this situation			0
right now , in the face of such a devastating tragedy , the future of a tv show seems like the most unimportant thing in the world , " she wrote			0
" but at the same time , we want @entity7 to be remembered			0
we want his life celebrated			0
we want @entity8 to honour both @entity7 and his character , because that 's what he deserved			2
" no matter how the storyline is altered to accommodate @entity7 's death , it is clear that the loss is a huge one for the show			1
" the musical comedy faces special circumstances , appealing as it does to a youthful demographic , swaths of which idolized or even ' carried a torch ' for @entity7 , " wrote @entity206 's @entity205			0
" viewers also will know the pain his on - / off - screen love , @entity27 , herself must feel , every time they see @entity23			0

" @entity8 " producers must now decide how to handle death of beloved actor
other shows have also had to address the loss of stars
fans are speculating as to what the show will do
