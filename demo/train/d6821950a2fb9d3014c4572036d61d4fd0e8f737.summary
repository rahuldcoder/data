-- this november , the @entity2 administration is expected to move forward with long overdue safeguards that would finally protect our families from mercury pollution			2
as the mother of four children , i can only say it 's about time			2
the @entity11 was first charged with limiting toxic air pollutants such as mercury during the @entity15 administration -- the first @entity15 administration			1
i do n't know how many children have been exposed to dangerous levels of this neurotoxin during the subsequent 20 - plus years of foot - dragging , but i do know that my eldest daughter was one of them			1
when @entity24 was 4 years old , we discovered that her mercury levels were elevated			1
we were already concerned because her learning had leveled off and in some notable ways even backslid			0
but it was only by chance that we realized she was being poisoned			0
because we lived in an old house with lead paint , we had been following our pediatrician 's advice to have our children tested regularly for lead and other heavy metals			0
only because of this were we lucky enough to learn about our daughter 's elevated mercury levels before it was too late			1
how does a healthy , well - nourished child get mercury poisoning in her own home ? by far the most common exposure to mercury comes from eating contaminated fish			0
@entity24 adored tuna fish sandwiches and ate one or two a week			0
that was a small amount but enough to cause her harm			0
when , on a doctor 's advice , we took fish out of her diet , her mercury levels declined			1
we 're thankful that our daughter suffered no permanent damage , but thousands of other parents are not so fortunate			0
exposure to mercury in utero can contribute to birth defects , including neurological and developmental disorders , learning disabilities , delayed onset of walking and talking , and cerebral palsy			1
the @entity11 estimates that as many as one in 12 @entity70 women of child - bearing age have enough mercury in their bodies to put a baby at risk			1
that means that every year more than 300,000 babies could be born at risk of serious disabilities caused by mercury poisoning			0
@entity81 is one of the most potent of the many toxic heavy metals that come from the emissions of coal - fired power plants			1
if just one - seventieth of a teaspoon enters a lake every year , it is enough to raise mercury levels in the fish			2
and yet the @entity11 reported in 2005 that coal - fired power plants , the largest domestic source of unregulated mercury emissions in the @entity70 , pumped 48 tons of this toxin into the atmosphere each year			1
the technology to filter mercury and other toxic heavy metals from power - plant smokestacks is widely available and , in fact , some plants already have it in place			2
under the @entity11 's proposed new protections , all plants would have to upgrade , and mercury emissions would be reduced by more than 90 % ( along with cancer - causing metals such as arsenic , chromium and nickel )			1
it would prevent hundreds of thousands of illnesses and up to 17,000 premature deaths each year			0
why has it taken more than 20 years to do something ? because corporate polluters do n't want to pay up to clean up , even though thousands of @entity70 pay dearly every year as a consequence			1
worse , their economic arguments are baseless			0
by cleaning up the coal plants , the new @entity11 protections will actually result in a net gain for the @entity70 economy			2
heart disease , learning disabilities and premature deaths are expensive , too			0
no parent should have to discover , as i did , that she is feeding her child poison in the sandwiches she packs in her lunchbox			0
after more than two decades , it 's time to stop dumping poison into the atmosphere and pretending there are no consequences			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			2

@entity139 : @entity11 was supposed to limit toxic pollutants like mercury 20 years *ago*
@entity139 's daughter had high levels of mercury , a neurotoxin , in her blood
@entity139 : @entity81 contributes to birth defects , nerve disorders , learning *disablilites*
it 's time to seriously limit mercury emissions that poison *environment* , she writes
