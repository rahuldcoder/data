-- @entity3 's governor declared a state of emergency tuesday related to a ruptured pipeline that caused tens of thousands of gallons of oil to gush into the @entity8 -- a break the pipeline 's owner still does n't know the cause of , a spokesman said			1
the declaration applies to @entity8 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity20 counties , all of which have been affected by the spill just before midnight friday			1
@entity24 has reported 750 to 1,000 barrels ( 32,000 to 42,000 gallons ) of oil escaped into river in @entity27 , about 16 miles southwest of @entity28			1
the longest undammed river in the @entity30 , the @entity8 eventually leads into the @entity31 , one of the biggest in the @entity30			1
@entity33 , the president of the @entity34 , told reporters tuesday that oil had been confirmed 25 miles away , with most such pockets within 19 miles of the leak site			1
but in the emergency declaration , which paves the way for emergency funds for the seven counties , gov. @entity39 claimed oil has since been discovered beyond @entity45 , about 90 miles from the leak site			1
the @entity48 governor stated in the same executive order that the " @entity34 ( is ) the responsible party for this release			1
" @entity24 has seen " measureable progress , " said @entity33 , as it has stepped up its cleanup effort -- one that 's come under criticism from @entity39			1
the @entity57 - based firm has committed 350 people to the spill response , up from the roughly 280 people working to mitigate the fallout as of monday night			2
of those , between 150 to 200 people are actually on the ground , cleaning up and looking for oil , said @entity33			2
" we 're going to keep adding resources , " @entity24 @entity65 told @entity0 on tuesday			1
" that 's our focus -- find the oil , clean it up and get it back to its original state as quickly as possible			1
" @entity39 toured the spill site tuesday morning , one day after criticizing the speed and effectiveness of the response in an interview with @entity0			2
later that day , @entity33 of @entity24 said , " we do not yet have a resolution , as to what caused the incident			1
" the current continued to move swiftly tuesday down the @entity8 , carrying with it all sorts of debris , like a tree 30 inches in diameter that @entity39 spotted			1
while no official determination has been made on what caused the pipeline rupture , the governor said it is easy to see the dangers posed by fast - moving waters			2
any pipelines built now , @entity39 noted , must be buried deeper under the riverbed in order to prevent such incidents			0
the company said it shut down the line within minutes after the break , but not before toxins had been dumped in the water			0
@entity39 told @entity102 on tuesday that a pressure drop tipped pipeline operators in @entity105 , @entity57 -- more than 1,300 miles from the rupture site -- seven minutes after the rupture occurred , with the shutdown complete within 30 minutes			1
@entity109 , a @entity27 rancher , said the spill left a " pretty heavy " smell of oil hanging over the area			1
the governor noted that roughly one year ago , several state , county and local agencies held a " mock pipeline spill " drill on the @entity8			1
many of those organizations , including the @entity122 , the state @entity123 and various @entity126 officials , are involved in the current effort in the southern part of the state			2
historically high water levels and rapid currents have made things difficult for those trying to clean up the spill			2
on saturday , levels near @entity28 reached their peak for the season at 13.95 feet , nearly a foot above flood stage , according to the @entity140			0
" the river level is actually up again , far exceeding its banks , " @entity65 told @entity0 tuesday			0
" it 's just not safe " for crews to go into the river itself			0
@entity147 , @entity126 's emergency services director , said over the weekend that crews have been forced to work from onshore for fear of being swept up in the water			2
@entity152 said monday it has eight boats ready to go should conditions improve			0
in terms of evacuations , flooding has -- and continues to -- affect more people in the region , thanks largely to the residual effects from the melting of massive winter snowpacks			0
about 200 residents were ordered out friday night , and then allowed back in the next morning			0
that 's significantly less than the hundreds who have been forced from their homes because of the persistent , far - reaching flooding in the area			0
" we have n't seen a lot of issues around here ( due to the spill ) , " said @entity170 , who works at the @entity171 in @entity28			0
" but there has been a lot of flooding , that has been a big issue			0
" still , @entity24 reported in a statement that it had received 94 calls to its community claims line as of monday night -- 36 of those coming from landowners reporting oil had washed up on their property			1
the governor called it premature to minimize the spill 's potential impact by saying , for instance , that it has only affected 10 miles of the river			1
his fear is that the abundance of fish , birds and animals in the area , which is about 100 miles downstream from @entity202 , may be hurt in the short and long term			0
" my biggest concern is those 1,000 barrels , " @entity39 said			1
" you can not dump ( that much oil ) into a pristine trout stream without causing damage to the fisheries			0
" besides the fish , the area is home to @entity215 geese , ducks , ospreys , otters and bald eagles , said @entity220 , an ecologist and conservation biologist who heads the @entity222			0
the birds , in particular , might die directly or indirectly as they go after fish			0
long term , and depending on factors like the quantity and nature of the leaked oil , toxins may kill critical insects , which in turn could have a trickle - down effect on the multimillion - dollar fishing industry , he said			0
" it could take years to really understand the impact of the spill , " @entity220 said			0
the @entity8 is the nation 's longest river without a dam -- a plus for the spill cleanup efforts because the continuously running water more easily breaks up the toxins , but a negative because any ill effects could spread into the @entity31 and its other tributaries , @entity220 said			1
more than 48,000 feet of absorbent boom and 2,300 absorbent pads had been used as of tuesday to soak up the oil , while " vacuum trucks " and tankers have been positioned nearby to transport them from the scene , according to @entity24			1
the company said the air quality and municipal water systems are also being monitored , while planes are routinely flying over the river to help detect patches of oil			0
@entity260 , an @entity24 spokesman , said the company is committed to staying the course and studying the effects through the whole course of the river			2
that includes checking water quality as far downstream as @entity268 ( 144 miles ) and @entity269 ( 222 miles ) from the original spill site			2
@entity33 said tuesday that no dangerous levels of oil have been detected yet in the air or ground water , even as he committed to continued checks for the foreseeable future			2
" we have not put ... any estimates about what this will cost , that 's not our primary focus right now , " said @entity33			0
" we are going to be here until the job is done			0
" @entity39 , too , promised that the state government agencies likewise would n't rest until the cleanup is complete and all related issues -- including the cost of the effort , a tab he said should go to the oil companies -- are resolved			1
" everybody in @entity3 will work hard until this is done , " the governor said			2
" we 'll be on it like a stink on a skunk			0
" @entity0 's @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 contributed to this report			0

new : an @entity24 official says oil detected 25 miles away ; the state says 90 miles
@entity3 declares a state of emergency for 7 counties , says @entity24 is responsible
@entity34 officials remain *unclear* of the cause of the spill in @entity3 's @entity8
