@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has taken over 20 years , but a woman was back on the track in the male - dominated world of @entity7			1
unfortunately not for very long			2
@entity8 became the first female since 1992 to take part in an @entity7 weekend , but after just four laps at friday 's @entity15 @entity14 practice session the 31 - year - old @entity11 had to retire because of an oil pressure problem			1
" it was a really tough day , " a dejected @entity8 told reporters at the historic @entity0 circuit , after her stricken car was hoisted back to the pits			1
" but that 's @entity7 sometimes			2
" although there has been a lot of media around my run , when it 's just you in the car it 's the best feeling			2
" i felt very ready for today -- i knew in my head what i had to do , it was good to get that first run of a race weekend in the bag			0
" @entity8 's best time of one minute and 44.212 seconds was set at the very start of the session and was not representative of her ultimate pace			1
@entity42 -- deputy team principal of her father 's eponymous race team and another strong female role model in the sport -- explained the team did not need to judge @entity8 's driving abilities during her practice debut			1
" that was heartbreaking really , " said @entity42			0
" the rest of the team are so disappointed for @entity8 as she 's put in so much effort and hard work and she 's been subjected to so much scrutiny			1
" it was nothing that she did , it was an issue with the car that we are investigating			0
" @entity42 ' deputy team principal praised @entity8 for her diligence ahead of the session			1
" we do n't have a question mark over her , " @entity42 told the media			0
" we 're not running her to see how good she is , that 's not what we 're doing			0
" she knows the car , she 's done a lot of preparation in the simulator , she 's spent a lot of time with the engineers and she 's perfectly competent in the car without causing any hindrance to the team			2
" she goes out there with her peers in a competitive situation			0
" @entity8 , who competed for six years in the popular @entity83 touring car championship before joining @entity84 , has been up against it both on and off the track			1
as the wife of @entity89 executive director @entity88 , who also owns just over 10 % of the @entity42 team , she has had to bat away suggestions that she owes her opportunity behind the wheel to nepotism			2
" i 've always said he 's my biggest supporter and also my biggest critic , " said @entity8 at @entity0			1
" he knew i had to go out there and do a good job today			0
he 's also quite sad that i did n't get the chance to show it			2
he would have loved it if i 'd have done the session and done a good job			0
" @entity42 ' deputy team principal has also had to deny employing @entity8 as the team 's development driver was just a publicity stunt			1
" it would be naive to say that having a female on board does n't bring you commercial benefit but everybody knows that @entity42 is a serious racing team , " she said			2
" we 're not only going to do something because it 's a marketing gimmick or could bring us in a load of dollars			0
" @entity8 has n't bought in those dollars and we have n't had any expectation that she would			1
she has to deliver technically which she 's done			0
" there was also support for @entity8 from her @entity15 peers at @entity0 -- former world champions @entity121 and @entity123			1
" she 's very , very talented , " said @entity89 driver @entity121 , who raced against her in his junior career in karting and @entity126			0
" it 's really cool to see her in a @entity7 car			0
" i did n't race against many girls			0
@entity8 was one of the very few , if not the only one , i raced against			1
we shared a podium together a couple of times			0
" @entity135 's @entity123 added : " she 's already driven in a test this year and went very well			2
it 'll be good to see her on track			2
" @entity8 will get a second chance to make her mark in first practice at the next grand prix in @entity83			1
" i 've still got one more shot at it , " said the 31 - year - old @entity8			1
" so , head up high and look forward to @entity145			0
" i did n't prove or show anything today			0
i really want to use that opportunity to show what i can do			0
" to get into an @entity7 car is so difficult that you want to maximize it			0
" asked why it had taken more than 20 years for a female racer to be given another opportunity in a competitive @entity84 session , @entity8 told @entity2 : " firstly , if there is no role model out there doing it , for all the little girls who come to the tracks and watch on tv , if they do n't see a girl on track then they 're not inspired to want to do that themselves			1
" that then leads to the second problem that there 's not enough girls karting or starting at a young age			0
interactive : @entity2 's guide to @entity0 " but sometimes in life you just need a chance , and i got that chance with the @entity42 team -- @entity177 and @entity42 gave me that big break			1
" @entity42 -- who grew up in motorsport 's macho environment -- told @entity2 : " i 'm always a believer that it 's up to individuals to come up and do it and that has n't happened for whatever reason			0
" @entity186 was the last woman to drive in the sport when she attempted to qualify for a race in 1992			1
the @entity189 was competing in an era of @entity7 when there were only 26 spots on the grid and more than 30 cars pushing for those places			0
@entity186 , driving for the @entity197 team , attempted to qualify at three races but was not able to break through with a largely uncompetitive car			2
of the seven women to join the @entity84 world championship , only two have ever qualified to start a race			1
the most prolific of these was @entity189 @entity204 , who started 12 grands prix in the 1970s			0
@entity204 made history while driving with march at a difficult @entity207 , becoming the only woman to register a point - scoring finish in a grand prix			1
the @entity211 , who died in october last year , also began her @entity84 career along with @entity8 when she was signed as a development driver by the @entity215 team in 2012 .			1

@entity8 became the first woman in *22* years to take to the track at an @entity219
but the @entity11 only lasted four laps before engine *failure* forced her to withdraw
@entity8 will have another chance to drive in practice ahead of the @entity83 @entity14
the 31 - year - old drives for the @entity84 team
