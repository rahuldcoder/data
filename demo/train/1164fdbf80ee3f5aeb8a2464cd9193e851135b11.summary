@entity0 -- a few days ago , i received an @entity4 message from a young girl who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder			1
she was struggling in school and depressed since being diagnosed			1
she shared her situation knowing i had found a way to live peacefully with my attention deficit disorder , which gave her hope she could do the same			1
i was so deeply touched because her story is mine			1
as early as the second grade , i knew something was different about me			1
i could n't sit still in class			1
it was torture for me			1
my teachers constantly requested i stop fidgeting , but i could n't			1
i was confused because other kids did n't seem to have my problem			1
additionally , it was impossible to focus on my teacher and her lessons			1
my mind would float off with the clouds , way more interested in imagination than the reality of a boring textbook			1
@entity29 always paled in comparison to the vibrant world i created in my mind			1
the classroom was my jail			1
the highlight of my day was recess , where i was a natural born leader			2
on the playground , i was somebody for one glorious hour a day			2
then it was back to the classroom and my feelings of inadequacies			2
my inability to sit still and focus eventually took its toll on my academic performance			2
if students could n't or did n't keep up , they were labeled " learning disabled " and placed in a " special " class with other kids who shared the same shame			2
regardless of your specific learning challenges , all students were thrown into one big class			2
it changed my mindset about my capabilities and who i thought i was			2
i labeled myself " stupid " and set out to prove my theory right			2
i lost all self - esteem and self - respect			2
in fifth grade , i gave up on myself			2
i stopped learning and started surviving			2
as my academic workload intensified , so did my self - loathing			2
i feared my deep , dark secret would be discovered at any moment			2
to prevent that from happening , i became the class clown			2
i developed skills to mask my inadequacies			2
for example , if i was asked a question and did n't know the answer , i would simply crack a joke			2
although i seemed happy , my despair over my academic performance weighed heavily on my heart			2
my parents tried their best to support me and lift my spirits , but their efforts fell on deaf ears			1
i felt alone , hurt and by high school , suicidal			1
sports provide a turning point luckily , sports were an arena where i excelled and felt good about myself			2
i was a natural athlete , and my sport of choice was softball			2
my parents took notice of my ability early			2
they practiced with me daily , came to my games and even coached my @entity90 softball team			0
often they taught me life lessons using sports analogies			0
they learned to speak " my language , " and it made sense			1
my tenacity , competitiveness and desire to win developed on the softball field			0
by the time i reached high school , i was a softball super star ! i still was n't a fan of schoolwork , but to play softball , i had to maintain a minimum 2.0 gpa			1
so , i did the bare minimum to be eligible for the team			0
during these years , my inability to control my emotions became a major part of my struggle			0
my temper tantrums were legendary			0
i started hanging out with some high school dropouts and experimenting with drugs because i wanted to fit in			1
still struggling with the undiagnosed adhd , i was a full - blown teenage jerk			0
luckily my parents were on top of it and implemented a strict and relentless set of rules			0
i would scream obscenities at the top of my lungs			0
i tried the silent treatment			0
my parent 's rules were set in stone like the @entity134 : no drugs , no loser friends and no dropping out of high school			1
i resigned myself to my fate			0
all i could see was the finish line my senior year			0
although my academic struggles still made me feel worthless , i stayed involved in school because as captain of the softball team , i was determined to see our team get to the state finals			1
we did make it , but were eliminated in the first round			0
nonetheless , i was honored as an all - state softball all - star -- a rare proud moment during my bleak high school years			1
high school musical to the rescue when softball season ended , i felt hopeless			1
i had no prospects for my future			0
college was n't an option because i could not imagine four more years of torture			0
on a whim and to procrastinate doing homework , i signed up to work as a props master for our annual high school musical			1
as i watched the performances from backstage , a small flame was ignited in me			0
a few days later , i sheepishly asked my parents what they thought of me becoming an actor			0
clearly concerned , they paused for a moment , then my father said , " you 'd be great at acting			0
" my mom then chimed in sarcastically , " you can put all those emotions to work " as she winked at me			0
that 's all i needed to hear			0
acting became my new softball , my new passion			0
suddenly the kid who hated school was going to college			1
in college , many of my @entity188 characteristics that had created so much grief in the past became assets			1
with my vivid imagination , i could believe wholeheartedly in the imaginary worlds portrayed in plays			0
i 'm also very emotional and impulsive			0
while these may not be such great qualities in a corporate office , they helped me excel in the world of theater			0
by my sophomore year , i was on a full academic scholarship			0
after i graduated from @entity204 in @entity205 , i moved to @entity206 to pursue my dream of becoming a professional actor			0
finally , my questions had answers fast forward to 2009			1
i 'm one of the stars of @entity213 's hit tv series " @entity214			0
" my early struggles in school were a distant memory			1
life was great , except for one little thing -- my daughter @entity221 was a real chip off the old block			1
she was fidgety and had a tough time sitting still in school			1
her second - grade teacher suggested @entity221 get tested for @entity188			1
the results confirmed she had it			0
on a whim , i decided to follow suit and get tested			0
finally my entire childhood made sense ! i was n't happy about having the disorder , but at least now i knew i was n't alone			0
i had a child to shepherd through the @entity232 landscape			0
i wanted her to thrive , not just survive like i did			0
i had to learn more			0
i googled @entity188 , and the first link to pop up was @entity240			1
everything i needed to know was there , including critical information about how to be a powerful advocate for your child in school			1
it was a light at the end of a tunnel			0
the website gave me the information and tools i needed to best support my daughter and myself			1
i contacted @entity254 and spoke with several members of their leadership team			1
i was so impressed with their resources , their commitment and dedication to this condition that i offered my services to support them			1
in late 2013 , @entity254 asked me to be their national spokesperson			1
i proudly accepted this important role to help people feel comfortable living with @entity188 and let them know they deserve the opportunity to live up to their full potential			1
early diagnosis and treatment greatly increase their chances of doing that			0
i want to share one more message with the young girl who sent me that @entity4 message and with others who are struggling with @entity280			0
( and lean forward because this is important )			0
you 're not stupid , broken or disordered			0
celebrate the good , step over the bad and work around the ugly			0
realize that those of us with @entity188 / @entity232 have a skill that allows us to see the world through a unique lens			1
we are different , not defective			0
you can see @entity290 on the " @entity214 " two - hour special sunday , march 16 , on @entity213 and follow her on @entity292 and @entity4 @ wendydoffical .			1
