@entity0 -- two weeks after a severely disabled @entity7 reportedly was " humiliated " by his treatment at a @entity10 airport security checkpoint , the details remain in dispute , but the government took steps wednesday to prevent a similar encounter from happening			1
the @entity11 said it is greatly expanding a program that expedites screening for active - duty and inactive " wounded warriors , " giving them the same expedited screening now available to active - duty , uniformed military personnel			1
wounded warriors who call or e-mail the @entity11 in advance of their trips will get benefits similar to those in the @entity11 's @entity24 program			1
they will be allowed to use dedicated screening lanes where available , leave on light outerwear , belts , shoes and hats , and keep laptop computers and 3 - 1 - 1 compliant liquids in carry - on bags			0
the @entity11 said it wants to provide " curb to gate service " for the wounded troops			2
" in recognition of the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform , we have revised our screening requirements to allow expedited screening for this trusted group of citizens , " @entity36 , @entity11 's deputy administrator and a 25 - year @entity38 veteran , said in a statement			2
the move comes after a march 13 encounter between a small group of @entity38 and @entity11 screeners at @entity54 sparked a spat between members of @entity57 and the @entity11			2
in a letter to @entity11 administrator @entity59 , rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , said the incident involved an active - duty @entity7 who had lost both of legs to an improvised explosive device , and was in a wheelchair , with limited or no mobility			1
a @entity11 officer asked the @entity38 to stand or walk , @entity60 wrote , " despite the fact that he physically could not stand or walk on his own			2
" the @entity11 screener then made the @entity38 remove his prosthetic legs , only to have them put back on so he could move to another area , where he was again asked to stand so that his wheelchair could be examined , @entity60 wrote			1
@entity60 -- basing his account on a person who had escorted the @entity38 -- described the @entity38 as " humiliated " by the encounter			0
the @entity11 disputes the account , saying that surveillance camera video and interviews with its officers showed that the man never removed his legs			1
the agency also said the two screeners involved both had extensive military careers -- one of them with the @entity38			2
both screeners acted appropriately , the @entity11 said			0
the @entity11 said it hopes to assist wounded warriors in the future though its @entity92			1
it gave this account of the process : -- once flight arrangements are made with the airline , the severely injured service member , or family member , or other representative can contact its operations center with travel details			0
the @entity11 prefers an e-mail to @entity103 to protect accuracy of the information , but will also accept calls to its toll - free number , ( 888 ) 262 - 2396			0
the operations center will acknowledge the request by reply e-mail , or over the telephone -- the operations center will then notify appropriate @entity11 officials at the involved airports			0
those officials are responsible for ensuring that necessary security screening is conducted " with empathy and respect , to make the overall experience for the @entity92 as simple and trouble - free as possible , " the @entity11 said			0
@entity11 spokesman @entity118 said the program " changes greatly " the process in which wounded warriors are screened , without creating a security vulnerability			1
as with all travelers , the veterans will be vetted against government watch lists of suspected terrorists , he said			0
a congresswoman who had introduced a bill requiring the @entity11 to give @entity24 privileges to wounded warriors applauded the @entity11 announcement wednesday , but said she would press forward with her bill			1
" i 'm pleased to see this action being taken by the @entity11 , " rep. @entity133 , @entity134 , said in a statement , adding that passage of her bill will " ensure that these changes are permanent			0
" rep. @entity139 , @entity140 , also issued a statement applauding the move .			0

the new @entity11 program comes in the wake of an incident involving a @entity38
airport screeners in @entity10 reportedly made the @entity38 remove his prosthetic legs
the @entity11 disputes details of that incident , but announces a new program for " wounded warriors "
the program will expedite screenings for active - duty and inactive " wounded warriors "
