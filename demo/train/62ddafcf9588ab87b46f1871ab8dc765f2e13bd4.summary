-- my political friends on the right always talk about small government , being fiscally responsible , and not burdening our children with a massive debt			0
so , i need a @entity9 in @entity10 , or anywhere else , to explain to me why the state is holding a @entity9 primary tuesday that will cost taxpayers more than $ 7 million and will have no effect whatsoever on the delegates chosen by the party in the @entity9 presidential race			1
when republicans in @entity10 head to the polls , they are voting in what is called a nonbinding primary			1
that means no matter who wins the popular vote , it will not determine who wins the state 's 52 delegates -- three of whom are unpledged @entity33 delegates			1
on march 17 , @entity10 republicans will caucus in counties to elect congressional district and state convention delegates			0
then on april 21 , they will select 24 of the state 's 52 delegates and award them to presidential candidates			2
and then on june 2 , the @entity10 @entity9 will meet in a statewide convention to choose the remaining delegates			2
that means today 's vote is a waste			0
@entity10 state officials need to tell the state @entity9 that if they want a primary , they should pay for it themselves			1
@entity10 is called the @entity10			0
do they want to me to show them a great example of the government wasting taxpayers ' money ? look no further than today 's @entity9 nonbinding primary			1
