@entity0 -- @entity3 officials say they ca n't explain why a fearful woman 's domestic - abuse report -- written in the woman 's native language of @entity8 -- was never translated into @entity9 for review , and for possible action			1
the woman and her two daughters subsequently were stabbed to death			2
the woman 's husband , arrested as he tried to flee to @entity17 , now faces charges of first - degree murder			1
and a group that has a lawsuit pending against the city on behalf of six other @entity24 women says the case of @entity26 and her young daughters is far from unique in @entity0			0
the paper trail that ends with the january deaths of @entity30 and daughters @entity32 , 2 , and @entity33 , 1 , stretches back to last may			2
on may 30 , @entity30 filed a police report saying she feared her husband would kill her and their two daughters			1
@entity30 spoke @entity8 , and it was in @entity8 that she filed the report			1
according to the @entity3 , that report was never translated into @entity9 for further review			2
on january 18 , according to authorities , @entity30 and her daughters were stabbed to death in their @entity49 apartment , allegedly by @entity30 's ex-husband and the girls ' father , @entity51			1
police say officers at the murder scene filed their own report , but the department has no explanation for what happened to @entity30 's report from months earlier or to another report from @entity30 , again written in @entity8 , after a november incident			1
" i knew about the police report , and i knew about the police showing up at the house previously on one of the times where @entity26 had called the police because she had been the victim of domestic violence , " says @entity63 , an attorney hired by @entity30 's family			1
" but we did not know that every time @entity26 filled out a report -- every time she went to the precinct or the cops came to the house -- no one actually translated the text into @entity9 , so , apparently no one looked into it			2
" no one translated it and they just put it away or placed it into the system ... three complaints were filed by @entity26 , and none of the times she filed a complaint did police actually arrest mr. @entity93 , her ex-husband			2
" police have confirmed the may 30 report , and @entity1 has obtained copies of reports dated november 27 and 28 from @entity30 's family , who found them among @entity26 's belongings after she died			1
on november 27 , cops responded to a call from @entity30			0
" she said when her husband came home , he threatened to kill her			0
she was crying so she called the police and told them that her husband had threatened to kill her , " said @entity104 , @entity30 's aunt , who was present during the police visit that time			1
as she had in may , @entity30 once again filed a domestic incident report and wrote in @entity8 , " at about 2:40 am my husband came home and assaulted me , he pulled my hair and kicked me twice , then grabbed my phone			1
after he did that , i called the police , but he changed and ran out taking a phone that is not mine with him			0
today in the morning , he was threatening me that he would take away my daughters			0
" police are unable to say whether that report was ever translated , either			0
on november 28 , @entity30 made a follow - up visit to the precinct , filling out another complaint , but her claims did not lead to an arrest			2
in statements to police following the slayings , @entity51 allegedly said he 'd been drinking when he got home on the night of january 18 , according to the @entity49 district attorney 's office			0
he went through his wife 's phone and @entity134 account and saw a photo of her with another man , he told prosecutors			0
according to the @entity49 district attorney 's office , @entity51 said he grabbed a knife and stood over @entity141 and allegedly stabbed his wife multiple times before entering his daughters ' bedroom where he gave each of them a hug and a kiss , and stabbed them as he asked for their forgiveness			2
the three bodies were discovered by @entity30 's uncle and a 12 - year - old cousin the next day			1
afterward , @entity51 tried to flee to @entity17 , according to police , but was arrested january 21 in @entity155 , @entity156 -- a town near the @entity17 border -- and brought back to @entity0			0
he was indicted on february 14 and will be arraigned in early march , the @entity49 district attorney 's office said			0
he is charged with first - degree murder , second - degree murder and fourth - degree criminal possession of a weapon			1
@entity51 faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if convicted on the murder charge , the district attorney 's office said			2
@entity30 's family believes that had the police taken action , she may still be alive			1
" if they would have given it more importance , would have translated it to @entity9 , then maybe they ( police ) would have figured out what to do , they would have investigated him , been more on top of the case , what was happening with them , " said @entity172 , @entity30 's mother			1
" if the police had done something , this tragedy could have been avoided -- my daughter would be alive			0
" some two months before @entity30 filed her written - in - @entity8 domestic - abuse report in may , an organization that serves " limited @entity9 proficient " domestic - violence victims filed a lawsuit against the city on behalf of six other @entity24 women , alleging the @entity3 denies interpreters to limited - @entity9 speakers , depriving " them of access to @entity3 services			1
" that lawsuit filed by the @entity202 is still pending			0
the group says @entity30 is but one of many women who are ignored by police because they can not file complaints in @entity9			0
the group alleges that the @entity3 's denial of interpreter services has deprived limited - @entity9 - proficient women of their right to report crimes , to protect themselves from dangerous abusers , and to communicate effectively with the police in a wide range of circumstances			1
" not only does the @entity3 fail to provide language assistance , it also degrades , ridicules and otherwise mistreats limited @entity9 proficient individuals who request interpreter services , actively demeaning them for their lack of @entity9 proficiency , " according to the lawsuit			0
the @entity3 directed all inquiries on the lawsuit to the @entity227 , which handles legal issues for the city			0
" the @entity3 has more foreign - language - speaking officers than any police department in the country , including thousands of @entity8 - speaking officers , " said @entity230 , spokesman for the @entity227			1
" also , the @entity3 has a corps of 19,000 members of the service who can provide interpretation services in over 70 languages			0
" but the @entity30 family , the @entity202 and the women the group represents say that it does n't matter how many officers can speak multiple languages if @entity9 statements provided by complaint victims are ignored			0
as a result of an internal review into the failure of officers to translate domestic incident reports , the @entity3 is verbally instructing officers on how to translate and store domestic incident reports that are prepared in texts other than the @entity9 language , according to @entity3 detective @entity258			0
" a memo will be transmitted to all commands informing domestic violence officers to immediately locate a member of the command who possesses the necessary language skills to translate a victim 's written statement to @entity9 , " she said in a prepared statement			0
for @entity30 's family , that may be too little , and it is definitely too late			2
" we 're thinking maybe we sue the police because this was n't just his ( @entity51 ' ) fault , the authorities are also at fault , " said @entity30 's mother			1
" my daughter may be dead and ca n't do anything in this case , but i want justice			2
