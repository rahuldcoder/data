@entity0 -- soldiers in full combat gear move silently through a sprawling shantytown in northern @entity0 , pointing weapons down narrow alleys and poking through sacks of cement in search of drugs			1
residents walk by , barely looking at the troops sent in to occupy the @entity13 as an emergency response to escalating violence in the city 's notorious favelas			2
some 2,500 army troops and marines have moved in to reinforce police in an operation aimed at securing the slum , home to 130,000 people , ahead of the @entity25 , which runs from june 12 to july 13			1
. seizing control from drug gangs was deemed a priority because the shantytown lies just a few kilometers from @entity0 's international airport			1
" it 's not a peaceful operation because we have three different criminal gangs here and they are rivals , " gen. @entity32 told @entity1			2
the @entity0 state government requested the army occupation after a series of attacks against police posts			1
the troops will remain until at least july 31 , after the @entity25 ends , @entity32 said			1
" it 's an emergency , " @entity32 said			2
" the state police so far do n't have enough policeman and enough equipment to operate in all the city			2
" it 's also the latest campaign in @entity0 's so - called " pacification " program launched in 2008			1
officials say that after neglecting security in the city 's poorest neighborhoods for decades , police have now seized control from drug gangs in dozens of slums			1
while soldiers have provided support during the initial campaign , they have been replaced by police posts in most operations			0
but for the @entity13 , officials decided more drastic measures were needed			0
unlike many of the favelas that cling to the hills near @entity0 's picturesque beaches , the @entity13 is a sprawling , mostly flat shantytown that combines 15 different neighborhoods in the city 's smoggy north zone			1
cement - block houses are covered with colorful graffiti and loops of tangled wire hang overhead , evidence of the do - it - yourself electricity that powers most homes			0
schoolchildren play soccer on a synthetic - turf court while residents sit at plastic tables set up in the street , drinking beer and listening to music blast over speakers , seemingly oblivious to the heavily armed soldiers who march by			0
when asked , they refuse to talk about the military occupation			0
troops have set up checkpoints at the entrances to the favela and patrol the streets on foot and in armored personnel carriers			0
soldiers with metal detectors and trained dogs search for hidden caches of arms or drugs			0
so far , they have registered more than a half dozen gun battles			0
the resurgence in violence in some of the favelas already pacified has raised alarms in a city that will host many of the 600,000 international fans attending the @entity25			1
@entity0 also will host the @entity115 in 2016			1
tourists strolling along @entity117 at the other end of the city said they were taking precautions , but not overly worried			0
@entity121 , a @entity122 businessman in town for a conference , said he was given a brochure with a list of security suggestions when he arrived			0
" i feel safe here , but i know where not to go , " he said			0
@entity130 , a @entity131 exchange student , agreed that a little knowledge goes a long way			2
" use common sense , grab a cab in the evening , " he said			0
" do n't use public transportation at night			2
" in the @entity13 , @entity32 said the military will have everything under control			0
" i can assure you that @entity141 has conducted a very well - planned operation to secure the 12 cities , " he said			1
" @entity0 will be prepared for the @entity25 , " he added , before his aides whisked him off , part of their policy never to let their top commander stay in one place for long in hostile territory .			1
