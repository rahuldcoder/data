an unmanned @entity1 - contracted rocket exploded in midair early tuesday evening , producing huge flames and loud booms along the eastern @entity7 coast but no injuries or deaths			1
@entity12 's @entity11 rocket and @entity14 cargo spacecraft had been set to launch at 6:22 p.m. et from the @entity15 along the @entity16 , carrying roughly 5,000 pounds of supplies and experiments to the @entity19			1
it exploded about six seconds after launch			2
what was left of the spacecraft and rocket plummeted back to @entity25 , causing even more flames upon impact			2
the rocket and spacecraft -- which together cost more than $ 200 million , according to @entity30 , the general manager of @entity12 's @entity31 -- are gone			1
and there 's obvious damage beyond that , including to the launchpad , though the night skies made it hard to immediately gauge how much			0
one thing officials do know is that rocket science is , in the words of @entity1 administrator @entity42 , " a really tough business			1
" " tonight 's events really show the difficulty that it takes for us to do this task of delivering cargo to the space station , " he said			1
what happened ? the @entity12 rocket had been set to go up monday , only to be scrubbed " because of a boat down range in the trajectory @entity11 would have flown had it lifted off , " according to @entity1			1
@entity57 spokesman @entity57 said the boat that triggered the postponement was 40 miles offshore			0
tuesday , by contrast , seemed perfect			0
just before liftoff , @entity1 reported " 100 % favorable " weather and " no technical concerns with the rocket or spacecraft being worked			1
" it seemed to be going perfectly when @entity66 saw the launch brighten up the sky from his vantage point about 3 miles away			0
" and then , all of a sudden , you see a big fireball , " said @entity66 , a @entity70 reporter			0
@entity66 recalled a loud boom that caused " your feet ( to ) shake a little bit , " as well as flames enveloping a roughly 100 - yard area around the launchpad in a marshy area with brush			2
@entity82 , who watched from a drawbridge because the @entity1 visitors station was ful , recalled a " breathtakingly beautiful " sight when the rocket ascended , followed by mass confusion as flames lit up the early nighttime sky moments later			1
" about 30 seconds later , we could hear and feel two booms reach us , and it was apparent the rocket had exploded , " she said			2
did you witness the rocket explosion ? please share your images @entity97 , a former @entity1 astronaut , said such a colossal fire was to be expected			1
" it takes a lot of propellant to take a spacecraft of that size moving 25 times the speed of sound , " @entity97 told @entity2 , explaining how fast the rocket should have gone on its way to the space station			1
" so when it fails , it 's usually pretty catastrophic			0
" authorities said the safety parameters appear to have worked , and noted the lack of casualties			0
" all we lost was hardware , " @entity30 said			0
" that hardware , however , is very important			0
" will rocket 's ' catastrophic failure ' set back the private space industry ? so what happened ? that 's exactly what officials -- both from public agencies like @entity1 and private companies like @entity12 -- hope to find out in the coming days and weeks			1
" what we know so far is pretty much what everybody saw on the video , " @entity30 said			0
" the ascent stopped , there was some , let 's say disassembly , of the first stage , and then it fell to @entity25			0
... we do n't really have any early indications of exactly what might have failed , and we need some time to look at that			0
" @entity12 will lead the investigation , along with the @entity140 , with @entity1 assisting			1
among other things , they 'll try to collect and examine any debris that can be recovered , review data from the spacecraft before its destruction and look at videos around the launch time			2
the main focus tuesday night was safety			0
@entity151 , the @entity15 director , said fire crews had set up a perimeter around the affected area			0
" we 're just basically letting the fire burn out , but they are contained , " he added			0
authorities expressed confidence that no people were directly affected by the explosion , but they could come across scattered remnants that are possibly floating in the water			0
as to when @entity12 will fly again from @entity164 , the only site it 's now permitted to launch from , @entity30 did n't specify a timetable beyond saying , " we will fly again as soon as we can safely			2
" @entity42 offered a similar take : " we 'll figure out what the failure is , we 'll fix it , and we 'll learn from it			0
" in the meantime , they 'll have to rebound from the loss			0
a third of the spacecraft 's cargo was material for scientific investigations such as a @entity182 school 's experiment on pea growth and a study on blood flow in space			2
there also were basic supplies meant for the crew of the space station -- now orbiting more than 200 miles above @entity25 -- including more than 1,300 pounds of food			1
but in the short term , no one is saying the space station 's six - person crew will go hungry			1
@entity1 wo n't directly restock them , having relied on private companies to do so since the end of its space shuttle program			2
that includes @entity7 - based @entity12 , which had its first of eight planned @entity19 launches in january out of the @entity164 facility as part of its $ 1.9 billion contract with @entity1			1
@entity12 becomes second private firm to send cargo to @entity19 if @entity12 ca n't resupply the space station , others can			1
on wednesday , for instance , a @entity210 @entity209 resupply spacecraft stocked with cargo and crew supplies is set to launch from @entity215			2
@entity216 , another private company , plans its fifth mission in december , including more supplies and a laser instrument to measure pollution , dust and other aspects of the atmosphere , according to @entity1			2
even if those missions somehow fail , the space station crew has enough on hand to last well into next year			1
" the station is in great shape ; the crew is in good shape , " said @entity227 , @entity1 's @entity19 manager			1
@entity232 : explosion as seen from @entity235 's eastern shore @entity2 's @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 contributed to this report .			0

explosion shows space travel " a really tough business , " @entity1 official says
spacecraft , rocket alone cost over $ 200 million , @entity12 exec says
space station crew is in good shape even without resupply , says official
the spacecraft burst into flames seconds after liftoff ; no injuries are reported
