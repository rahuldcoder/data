-- @entity1 remains the frontrunner in the @entity4 sweepstakes			1
@entity5 let him go , neither ready to arrest him on behalf of the @entity8 nor willing to let him stay			2
@entity11 authorities have played coy , looking to avoid open conflict with the @entity8 but hardly forthcoming with any details			2
even @entity14 is in the mix , perhaps as a temporary detour on the way to somewhere else			0
but it is @entity1 , of all places , that appears consistently as the country most willing to openly challenge the @entity8 , apparently not averse to allowing @entity4 to land in @entity22 while considering a request for asylum			1
how do we understand the inability of the @entity8 to capture a @entity8 citizen who has been charged with espionage and no longer has a valid @entity8 passport ? why wo n't anyone help the @entity8 get this guy ? and why does @entity1 in particular appear willing to embrace @entity4 and oppose the @entity8 ? where on @entity33 could @entity4 go next ? part of the explanation lies in the fact that the @entity8 does not appear to be garnering much sympathy on this issue within the international community as a whole			1
@entity41 , @entity11 , @entity14 and @entity1 are hardly alone in wanting to poke at the @entity8 by helping @entity4			1
foreign observers are much less interested in the relative virtues of @entity4 ( traitor ? hero ? refugee ? attention - seeker ? ) and much more willing to focus on the actions of the @entity8 government , which outside our borders tends to be understood as part of a long history of out - of - control surveillance by @entity8 intelligence agencies			1
in this sense , the @entity8 may have the law on its side when demanding the arrest of @entity4 , but it does not , from the perspective of many foreign observers , have a moral leg to stand on			1
our past use of covert surveillance at both home and abroad , combined with our current pursuit of an individual who exposed questionable surveillance programs , has meant that our attempts to capture @entity4 , however sound legally , have been effectively undermined by our own moral bankruptcy within international circles ( at least with respect to issues of surveillance , privacy , espionage , etc. )			2
4 options for the @entity8 to get @entity4 back this perception is all the more pervasive in @entity80 , where decades of @entity8 support for repressive military dictatorships was enforced by a wide range of surveillance programs that were often permitted and justified by legal statutes			1
still , why @entity1 ? the prevailing explanation among @entity8 pundits is that @entity4 and @entity1 president @entity87 are " unlikely allies " and thus @entity87 's stance has nothing to do with @entity4 's actions or the fact the @entity8 is pursuing him			1
in other words , it is all about scoring political points			0
this is too simplistic an explanation and relies on a misunderstanding of @entity87 and the leftward shift that has swept @entity80 during the past 25 years			0
@entity4 : i took job to gather evidence politicians are always looking to score political points , and @entity87 has certainly had his moments			2
but when @entity87 offered @entity108 journalist @entity107 asylum in 2012 , he had relatively little to gain politically beyond raising his international profile			0
at the time , he was expected to easily win re-election ( which he did ) , in large part because under his administration unemployment levels had reached record lows , public spending on education had more than doubled and medical care was more accessible than ever			0
this was despite the fact that @entity1 had been hit harder than almost any country in the region by the financial crisis of 2008			0
@entity87 pumped money into the economy , reformed the financial system , took control of the central bank and otherwise worked , however imperfectly , to build a government and economy that serves the interests of the people			0
simply put , @entity87 's popularity insured that there was relatively little to be gained by taking on @entity107 in 2012			0
quite the opposite , @entity87 's embrace of @entity107 produced an intense backlash by the media in @entity1 , which then amped up opposition during the election			2
similarly , @entity87 will score relatively few political points by embracing @entity4 in 2013			0
@entity87 's stance is best seen as a principled one			0
in broad terms , @entity87 's openness to @entity107 and @entity4 , as well as his decision to close a @entity8 military base in @entity1 , is part of an effort to deepen @entity1 sovereignty while strengthening @entity80 's ability to limit the influence of the @entity8 in the region			1
opinion : why @entity8 is being humiliated by the hunt for @entity4 this is perfectly within the rights of an independent nation , even one that has historically followed the @entity8 lead			1
more immediately , @entity87 's willingness to take on @entity4 should be seen for what it is , as a refreshingly principled stand by a small country against a powerful nation engaged in what many see as the political persecution of one of its own citizens			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

@entity1 seems willing to consider giving asylum to @entity4
@entity170 : many around the world question the morality of @entity8 policy
he says the @entity4 case affords opponents a chance to put @entity8 on *defensive*
@entity170 says @entity1 's president has *legitimate* questions about @entity8 policy
