-- @entity1 struggles with asthma and migraines			0
his @entity5 family has done everything they can to help -- they 've torn out the shrubs by his house , thinking he may be allergic to them			0
they 've ripped out a wall , thinking there might be mold there			0
but still the high school junior does n't feel good			1
" i thought it was the seasons , like the weather changing , " @entity1 said			0
now his family believes there may be something else to blame : his school			1
a group of @entity1 's teachers at @entity27 sent a letter to the @entity30 's risk manager on october 4 , complaining about a variety of illnesses			1
they suspect their working environment is at fault , but administrators say they are still investigating , and some experts are skeptical			2
" at this point , there is nothing to let people know , other than employees had health concerns , " @entity38 , the district superintendent , told @entity40 affiliate @entity41 / @entity39			2
" we do n't have any evidence whatsoever that there is any contaminant , any issue in or around that building			0
" the letter says the teachers " are extremely concerned about their health and safety			1
" three teachers at the school have been diagnosed with stage 1 thyroid cancer in the past six months			1
some seven teachers complained about migraines			2
the letter says the teachers who are sick work primarily in the main middle school building ( the school services grades 6 through 12 ) , the music and drama building , the visual arts building and in the school 's theater			1
when one teacher moved to another building , her migraines got better , the letter states			0
another teacher who moved from one of the suspected buildings stopped getting a rash she 'd been suffering from for four years			2
the letter publicly requests environmental tests be done at the school and asks the district to make those test results public			1
" skepticism is totally an appropriate way to approach this , " said dr. @entity87 , chief medical officer for the @entity88 , who is not involved in the investigation			0
the teachers ' letter characterizes the number of teachers being diagnosed with the same type of cancer as " alarming , " but @entity87 said thyroid cancer is unfortunately " incredibly common			1
" overall in the @entity101 there has been an increased rate of thyroid cancer since 1973			1
the @entity103 theorizes that the increasing rates simply reflect that the disease has gotten easier to detect			0
the @entity88 estimates there will be 60,220 new cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed in 2013			1
women between the age of 35 and 65 are at highest risk			0
scientists believe most cases of thyroid cancer are hereditary			1
" the only instances where we have ever seen a man - made thyroid cancer from exposure ( to environmental chemicals ) is someone exposed to a high dose of iodine			1
and it takes years to develop thyroid cancer from it , " @entity87 said			1
even if for some reason radioactive iodine were found in these school buildings , the chemical only has a half - life of 42 days , meaning it would disappear after that			1
then the danger would be gone			0
" very few people will develop a cancer immediately after an exposure , " @entity87 said			2
" now if they were exposed to something in the late ' 80s or early ' 90s , then maybe there would be something			0
" cancer clusters are also uncommon , according to scientific research			2
a well - respected study from dr. @entity141 that published in a @entity142 for @entity143 found that of all the cases of alleged clusters , only 5 % to 15 % actually were cancer clusters			2
the @entity103 defines a cancer cluster as a " greater - than - expected number of cancer cases that occurs within a group of people in a geographic area over a period of time			2
" while environmentally - derived thyroid cancers are rare , what is much more common are health issues caused by mold			1
dr. @entity160 : toxic schools some studies estimate a third or more of @entity101 schools have mold , dust or other indoor air problems that are serious enough to cause serious respiratory illnesses such as asthma			2
only about 20 % to 30 % of the population is actually susceptible to indoor air problems like mold or dust , but for those who are , the symptoms get increasingly severe			2
legally there are no indoor air quality standards for schools			0
yet a national survey of school nurses found that 40 % knew children and staff who were adversely affected by indoor pollutants at their school			0
one school in @entity185 , @entity186 , had such a bad mold problem the district tore it down in 2000 , but not before one of its teachers , @entity191 , became permanently disabled with a serious lung condition called @entity193			1
she had to leave teaching after being in a classroom for 23 years			0
are schools making us sick ? as a precaution , @entity199 has brought in an environmental firm to run tests on the buildings and the surrounding soil			1
the district has closed a building and relocated students			0
" we want to be diligent and overly cautious just to make sure there is n't anything here , but we do n't want to panic , " principal @entity208 told @entity40 affiliate @entity41 / @entity39			0
the news , though , is still unsettling to parents			0
the school brought them in for an informational session about the issue on tuesday			1
@entity219 , whose son has been so sick with asthma and migraines , is upset			0
you think you are doing the right thing then you 're suddenly , you have this total self - doubt that you 're not at all , " @entity1 said			0
asked what she will do next if her son 's health problems continue , @entity1 concluded , " i do n't know what to do			1
i 'm just a mother			0
