@entity0 -- a program that allows airports to replace government screeners with private screeners is being brought to a standstill , just a month after the @entity7 said it was " neutral " on the program			1
@entity7 chief @entity9 said friday he has decided not to expand the program beyond the current 16 airports , saying he does not see any advantage to it			1
though little known , the @entity14 allowed airports to replace government screeners with private contractors who wear @entity7 - like uniforms , meet @entity7 standards and work under @entity7 oversight			1
among the airports that have " opted out " of government screening are @entity22 and @entity23			2
the push to " opt out " gained attention in december amid the fury over the @entity7 's enhanced pat downs , which some travelers called intrusive			2
rep. @entity29 , a @entity30 from @entity31 , wrote a letter encouraging airports to privatize their airport screeners , saying they would be more responsive to the public			2
at that time , the @entity7 said it neither endorsed nor opposed private screening			1
" if airports chose this route , we are going to work with them to do it , " a @entity7 spokesman said in late december			1
but on friday , the @entity7 denied an application by @entity44 in @entity45 to privatize its checkpoint workforce , and in a statement , @entity9 indicated other applications likewise will be denied			2
" i examined the contractor screening program and decided not to expand the program beyond the current 16 airports as i do not see any clear or substantial advantage to do so at this time , " @entity9 said			1
he said airports that currently use contractor screening will continue to be allowed to			2
@entity9 said he has been reviewing @entity7 policies with the goal of helping the agency " evolve into a more agile , high - performance organization			2
" told of the change friday night , @entity29 said he intends to launch an investigation and review the matter			0
" it 's unimaginable that @entity7 would suspend the most successfully performing passenger screening program we 've had over the last decade , " @entity29 said friday night			1
" the agency should concentrate on cutting some of the more than 3,700 administrative personnel in @entity0 who concocted this decision , and reduce the army of @entity7 employees that has ballooned to more than 62,000			1
" " nearly every positive security innovation since the beginning of @entity7 has come from the contractor screening program , " @entity29 said			1
a union for @entity7 employees said it supported the decision to halt the program			1
" the nation is secure in the sense that the safety of our skies will not be left in the hands of the lowest - bidder contractor , as it was before 9/11 , " said @entity76 , president of the @entity77			0
" we applaud @entity85 for recognizing the value in a cohesive federalized screening system and work force			0
" advocates of private screeners say it is easier to discipline and replace under - performing private screeners than government ones			0
but @entity95 members have differed over the effectiveness of private screeners			0
@entity29 said tests show that private screeners perform " statistically significantly better " than government screeners in tests of airport checkpoints			0
but the @entity103 says it " did not notice any difference " during covert checkpoint testing in 2007			0
both groups failed to find concealed bomb components , the @entity103 said			0
test results are not publicly disclosed			0
on friday , rep. @entity109 of @entity110 , the ranking member on the @entity111 , lauded @entity9 's decision			0
" ending the acceptance of new applications for the program makes sense from a budgetary and counter-terrorism perspective , " he said in a statement .			0

agency chief says there are no advantages to the program
last month , the agency said it would help airports *enroll*
