-- no one wants to spend their vacation in the bathroom			0
reports of an outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea at sea have some imminent cruisers worried			2
" my mother , who is a first time cruiser , is seriously reconsidering our choice for our family vacation , " wrote @entity0 reader @entity11 in an e-mail			0
the @entity19 student is booked on a carnival cruise with her family in march			2
the @entity22 is investigating an outbreak this week of gastrointestinal illness on @entity26 's @entity25 ; the cause has not yet been determined			1
more than 650 passengers and crew have become ill , according to the cruise line			1
the outbreak is the second so far this year aboard a cruise ship			1
just the thought of wasting precious vacation time has worker - bee bystanders riled up : so glad it 's not me ! poor suckers ! and cruise skeptics have another opportunity to ask : what were they thinking ? " i feel bad for sick people , but i do n't understand the desire to be on the petri dish in the first place , " wrote one @entity0 reader			1
cruising represents one of travel 's deeper divides			0
love it or hate it , most of the keenest objections are only half true -- or false , depending on how you look at it			0
floating petri dishes ? cruise ships are ripe for spreading illness			1
outbreaks of norovirus , the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in the @entity66 , occur most frequently in close quarters , according to the @entity22			1
nursing homes , dormitories and cruise ships are common transmission grounds			1
in 2013 , the @entity22 's @entity72 logged nine gastroenteritis outbreaks aboard ships , seven of which had a confirmed cause of norovirus			1
about 1,200 cruise passengers were affected by those norovirus cases			1
three of the affected sailings were from @entity66 ports , with about 700 passengers sickened , according to @entity85 , ceo of @entity86			1
to put those figures in perspective , the industry 's @entity87 says more than 10 million passengers embarked on @entity87 member cruise ships from a @entity66 port in 2012 , and norovirus sickens an estimated 21 million people in the @entity66 every year , according to the @entity22			1
more outbreaks of gastroenteritis have been reported aboard cruise ships since 2001 , according to @entity22 statistics			1
the government agency says the spike is tied to an increase in both passengers and ships sailing the seas as well as an overall increase in norovirus outbreaks			1
" there are attempts to control these types of outbreaks , but it 's hard to guarantee that it 's not going to happen for any particular cruise , " said dr. @entity108 , director of the @entity109 at @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112			2
so yes , the threat of illness is real			2
yet the number of reported outbreaks among thousands of annual sailings has ranged in recent years from less than a dozen affected sailings to about three dozen			0
bottom line : more people are getting sick on land			0
( granted , that 's little comfort if you 're vomiting violently at sea )			0
are ships or passengers unsanitary ? @entity136 , the most common cruise ship outbreak offender , spreads quickly from person to person but can also be transmitted through contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces			1
the @entity22 's @entity72 conducts regular unannounced inspections of cruise ships			1
@entity25 , the @entity26 ship currently experiencing an outbreak , scored a 98 out of 100 on its last inspection in july 2013			1
" something like this is not representative of an unclean ship , " said @entity147 , managing editor of @entity148			0
" it does n't mean this particular vessel was unclean			0
it just means there was an outbreak on board			0
they 're ending the cruise two days early and doing a really deep cleaning of the ship			2
it 's not likely to happen on the same ship again			0
" unlikely , but not unheard of : @entity165 ' @entity164 had norovirus outbreaks on two consecutive sailings in 2012			0
in 2010 , the @entity22 issued a four - day no - sail recommendation for a @entity170 ship after three consecutive outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness			1
the deep cleaning upon @entity25 ' return to port " will be the third aggressive sanitizing procedure the ship has undertaken since we became aware of the issue , " @entity26 said			0
cruise lines activate @entity22 - monitored response plans when outbreaks are detected			1
measures include increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfection , isolating ill people , distributing information about proper hand - washing and hygiene as well as illness updates and regular reporting to @entity194 officials			2
hygiene is extremely important when outbreaks occur			0
proper hand - washing , avoiding contact with ill passengers and direct contact with public surfaces such as restroom door handles can help stem the spread of highly contagious illness			2
the @entity22 offers health tips for cruisers on its website			2
@entity210 cruiser @entity208 and her husband wo n't be changing their plans for an upcoming sailing on @entity26 's @entity215			0
" it is not the cruise line 's fault			0
it is a passenger who came onboard sick and spread the virus everywhere			0
on every cruise i have been on , the crew is diligent in keeping things clean and making passengers use hand sanitizer , " @entity222 , of @entity223 , @entity224 , wrote in an e-mail			2
if you stop your life for fear of what could be , you never experience anything			0
" @entity0 's @entity237 contributed to this report .			0
