@entity0 , @entity1 -- the overflowing @entity3 dealt anguish to its namesake state thursday , reaching a historic height at @entity0 , sending backwater up the @entity8 , which has swallowed a home owned by the governor , and claiming the life of a 69 - year - old man			1
as the flood 's trail of destruction worked its way south , @entity0 saw the river crest at the expected peak of 57.1 feet early thursday , hours ahead of the original forecast			1
the @entity20 predicts the crest will hold through at least saturday morning			0
" residents who live along the river need to keep an eye out and be vigilant , " said @entity22 , a senior hydrologist with the weather service 's @entity1 , office			1
" we 're not going to fall to the kind of levels we got to during the large 2008 flood until early june , and wo n't fall below flood stage until mid-to - late june			1
" @entity33 sheriff @entity32 said the county , which includes @entity0 , has " several hundred homes that have water			1
" about 2,000 residents have been displaced , including nearly 1,000 who were evacuated from @entity39 10 days ago			1
so far , a critical levee near the lake is holding			0
many @entity33 residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do , but none have experienced it at this magnitude , @entity32 added thursday			2
also of concern is a traffic " nightmare " on the principal north - south highway , said @entity32			1
" we 've never seen water that has closed @entity54 61 , " he said			1
@entity0 motorists can not take @entity54 61 to reach @entity56 to the north or @entity58 to the south because of flooded roadway			1
instead , commuters are using two - lane roads that were n't designed for the volume , the sheriff told @entity2			2
the river began cresting ahead of schedule wednesday night , probably because an old levee system in @entity68 , @entity1 , was breached last friday and spread the flood 's flow , @entity22 said			2
the @entity1 is more than 14 feet above flood stage at @entity0 and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927			1
water levels in @entity76 , a city about 70 miles south , are already nearly 4 feet beyond the record , with the river at 61.9 feet thursday night -- and the crest is n't expected to arrive until saturday			1
a @entity0 resident , @entity79 , died after being pulled from floodwater in @entity33 , @entity1 , the county coroner said thursday			1
it is the first reported death linked to the flooding in the state			2
emergency workers with the fire department pulled him from the water at 9:35 a.m. tuesday and took him to @entity89 , where @entity79 was put on life support , coroner @entity85 said			2
officials do not know how @entity79 ended up in the floodwater , the coroner said			0
the @entity93 was keeping a watchful eye on the @entity95 , which residents near @entity0 were counting on for protection			1
it is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the @entity101			2
the backwater levee was being " armored " by a heavy plastic coating to prevent it from washing out , said @entity104 , attorney for the @entity105			0
but the @entity8 backwaters were already claiming territory and property			0
@entity1 gov. @entity109 was among residents who watched rising waters swallow their houses and lands wednesday			0
@entity109 's spokeswoman confirmed that a house owned by the governor in his native @entity117 was flooded			2
the house is on a lake in central @entity1 near the backwater - flooded @entity8			2
a slide was detected on the mainline @entity1 levee at @entity122 , the @entity93 said thursday			0
a slide occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded , said @entity93 spokeswoman @entity128			0
the slide was detected wednesday and work began immediately to repair it			0
" it will take about a full week to repair , " she said			0
farther south , where the @entity3 has not yet crested , residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by			0
@entity139 gov. @entity138 has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding resulting from the @entity142 , where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing @entity145 further downstream			1
" as water from the @entity142 is released into the @entity152 , the impact to our rural communities and the industries upon which they rely will be dramatic and long - lasting , " @entity138 wrote the @entity54 @entity147 , his office announced thursday			1
" i am requesting your immediate consideration of available assistance and recovery programs for our recreational and commercial fishing , hunting , and eco-tourism industries			2
" mandatory evacuations will be in effect saturday -- beginning at midnight friday -- in @entity164 , @entity165 and the @entity166 , the @entity161 said			0
by 8 a.m. saturday , " the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter , " the parish said in a news release			0
@entity172 administrator @entity171 praised the efforts under way along the @entity1			0
" fortunately , the system is working as designed between the @entity93 and the design structures and where they are having to open the spillways , they 've been able to take pressure off the mainline levee , " he said at an event in @entity176			0
officials said spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks , and it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage , allowing those who have evacuated to return			0
the flood is the most significant to hit the lower @entity3 valley since at least 1937			0
it has affected nine states so far : @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity139 and @entity1			1
although recovery is a while off for areas that have already seen the worst of the floods , @entity205 , @entity1 -- about 180 miles north of @entity0 -- saw another step forward thursday , with the return of a key economic driver for the region			1
the @entity210 reopened 4 p.m. thursday , the second to return to business in two days with signs reading , " we 're back y'all			1
" casino officials said the reopening celebration included a $ 50,000 donation to the @entity217			0
" i did n't know if this day would come or not , " said @entity218 , the president for the mid-south region for the @entity221 group			0
" it 's hard to believe that , just a few short days ago , we had about 4 and a half feet of water in these parking lots			1
" @entity2 's @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
