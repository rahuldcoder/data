@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 said tuesday that the controversial tactic that allowed illegal guns to be smuggled to @entity6 " should never have happened , and it must never happen again			1
" in testimony to the @entity8 , @entity2 hit hard at the @entity10 practice that has tainted his tenure at the @entity12 and led to some @entity14 calls for him to resign			1
" i want to be clear : any instance of so - called ' gun walking ' is unacceptable , " @entity2 said of weapons smuggling , later adding : " this operation was flawed in its concept , and flawed in its execution			1
" @entity2 acknowledged what critics have been saying about the long - term consequences of " gun walking			2
" " unfortunately we will feel its effects for years to come , as guns that were lost during this operation continue to show up at crime scenes both here and in @entity6 , " @entity2 said			2
" we are losing the battle to stop the flow of illegal guns to @entity6			1
" @entity2 defended his own actions , reminding the panel he called for the inspector general to examine the so - called @entity38 and issued a directive that " gun - alking " was illegal and should never be repeated			1
the resulting report may be concluded before the end of the year			0
however , @entity2 stopped short of laying blame for the flawed operation			0
last week , his assistant attorney general , @entity45 , expressed " regret " for his failure to alert @entity2 about a similar earlier operation called " @entity38 " which had employed similar @entity10 " gun - walking " tactics during the @entity51 administration			1
at the hearing tuesday , @entity52 sen. @entity52 of @entity53 said , " it does n't matter how many laws we pass if those responsible for enforcing them refuse to do their duty -- as was the case in @entity38			1
" @entity52 pressed @entity2 at the hearing about who had leaked a sensitive document to the press regarding a whistle - blower who had come forward with allegations of gun - walking			1
@entity52 asked who was being held accountable			0
@entity2 refused to answer , but several hours later @entity52 said @entity12 had provided him a document in a classified setting			1
@entity52 revealed that former @entity73 attorney @entity72 , who resigned from his post , had leaked the document to the press			0
still , the senator said , he is not satisfied			0
" the @entity12 should not be allowed to continue to scapegoating the one person who has resigned , " @entity52 said , promising to pursue the matter further			0
despite the disagreements , @entity2 pressed for congressional cooperation			0
he made a plea to the committee for strengthening the authority of the @entity10 to detect and disrupt illegal gun trafficking , and urged full funding for the @entity10 to combat gun - running			2
he added : " i am determined to ensure that our shared concerns about @entity38 lead to more than headline - grabbing @entity0 ' gotcha ' games and cynical political point scoring , " @entity2 concluded			0
@entity2 has the support of sen. @entity94 , @entity95 , chairman of the committee , who opened the hearing by reciting successes by the @entity12 under @entity2 's leadership			2
on monday , @entity94 tried to lower the heat on @entity2 by raising it on the @entity51 administration for @entity38			0
in a letter to the @entity12 inspector general , the senator asked whether the current investigation also will cover the @entity51 - era supervision of the @entity10 in 2006 when , he said , " hundreds of weapons apparently moved beyond the custody and control of the @entity10 and possibly into @entity6 and @entity111			1
" @entity94 said that then - attorney general @entity112 may have been briefed in the case in 2007			2
@entity2 faces what is likely to be a much more hostile environment next month when he testifies before a @entity117 panel , where @entity14 @entity118 , @entity119 , will wield the gavel and control the questioning			0
@entity1 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0
