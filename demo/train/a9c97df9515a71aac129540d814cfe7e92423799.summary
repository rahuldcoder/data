-- in my mind -- and in the law -- there are two kinds of sexual harassment			1
the first kind is quid pro quo and easy to spot			0
a really detestable ( usually ) man gives his ( usually ) female subordinate employee or student an ultimatum : put out or lose some opportunity , be it a grade , a job or a promotion			0
during the " @entity20 " era , bosses got away with such , and women thought it the price of a life outside the kitchen			2
women no longer think this is ok			0
professors even lose tenure over this clearly sexist and illegal behavior these days			2
we 've come a long way on the road to equality on this front			0
lawyers do n't settle such claims for a few months ' salary and a promise of silence			2
no one knows right now if this is the kind of sexual harassment that @entity44 is accused of , but i doubt it			1
for one thing , several others have claimed they witnessed the harassment of the women in question , and such bold threats are n't often made over the dinner table in a restaurant with observers			1
but then there is the other kind of sexual harassment , the behavior that makes the workplace uncomfortable , that creates an environment that is hostile to women in general , or just to one person because of her ( or his ) sex , gender , race or ethnicity			1
everyone agrees that workplaces ought not to differentiate between actors simply because of their sex , gender , race or ethnicity			0
but beyond that , when sex and gender are involved , we often get into a " he said / she said " dialogue			2
for example , he believed the jokes were simply funny and created a more friendly setting ; she believed they were offensive and created an us ( the boys ) versus them ( her or her and other women ) organizational climate where she was always going to be outside the loop , outside informal conversations and social networks that mattered			0
another example might be when a powerful man is attracted to one of his co-workers and simply wants to start some sort of sexual friendship , an offer he perhaps had made many times before and occasionally was accepted			1
but this time , the woman finds a sexual overture from a married boss intimidating and off - putting			2
she believes it changes forever the climate of the workplace			2
even if he never threatened her status after the " invitation , " she did n't believe the professional relationship would ever be the same after what she perceived to be sexual harassment			1
if we look at sexual harassment in these terms , as he said / she said , we will never find a solution -- ethical , legal or moral to the problem			1
at this point , we have yet to create any consensus around the appropriate way to deal with sexual attraction and sexual desire in the workplace			1
no one can deny that workplaces are often where adults meet their life partners			0
in a 24/7 work environment , where else do you have to meet a spouse ? and indeed , in a world where people often think of themselves as defined by " what they do , " it makes sense that those who also do it are the people we have enough in common with to fall for , whether it 's to fall in love , or even just in lust			2
and yet , we are still in a world where the most powerful class of actors happens to be older men			1
we do not live in some post-feminist world , where power is yet equally shared			0
no one wants to anger or displease one 's boss , even a little			0
nor do we live in a world where the workplaces have become truly integrated by sex			0
in fact , the most recent research suggests that in the last decade , we 've stalled at integration by sex			0
while women are getting more and more of the degrees , they remain in traditionally female - dominated fields , and are not moving forward in male - dominated ones			0
my hypothesis for why is that heavily male - dominated occupations , including politics , are so heavily masculine in their cultures , full of sexual innuendo and -- perhaps -- the kind of sexual harassment of which @entity44 is accused			1
i do n't have an easy answer , but i do know we 'll never solve the problem by trying to figure out what he said or she said			0
instead , we have to decide what , as a society , we want to be acceptable or not in our workplaces and schools and then enforce the norms with legal penalties			0
here 's a first volley : it should be illegal for men ( or women ) to make sexual overtures to their subordinates			1
power always gets in the way of easily saying no. but more than that , if we want workplaces that do not privilege the men who have previously dominated the social space , we need to change the culture in which sexual banter objectifies women and turns them into the " other , " and take seriously the claims by women that men harass them			1
the more subtle kind of sexual harassment has consequences not only for the individual woman who finally complains , but for all of us , by sustaining a culture where the powerful positions in many occupations , including politics , remain dominated by men			1
should accepting boorish sexual banter and unwanted sexual approaches be the price of admission to male - dominated occupations ? it 's up to us as a society to set the standards			1
here is a moment in time to take stock : let 's hear what the women who were silenced by being paid off have to say about the private behavior of a very public man who is running for president			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			2

@entity238 : society has n't reached consensus on what 's ok in workplace
she says sexual harassment cases often involve " he said / she said " dialogue
@entity238 : men remain more powerful in workplace , so rules must be *consistent*
she suggests rule that it 's illegal for bosses to make sexual overtures to subordinates
