-- if you 're good enough at what you do , it is possible to live forever			1
that 's a lesson to be drawn from the news out of @entity6 last week			1
a painting by the @entity9 artist @entity8 , which was previously believed to be a forgery , has been authenticated			1
" @entity14 , " a landscape painted by @entity8 in 1888 , has been painstakingly studied by experts at the @entity12 , using sophisticated chemical - and - technological analysis			1
their conclusion : it 's the real thing			1
it is said to be the first full - sized canvas by @entity8 to be found in 85 years			1
in the past , paintings by @entity8 have sold for tens of millions of dollars apiece			1
he has been dead since 1890 , when , in one of many moments of despair , he took his own life			2
even before he entered the world , there were omens that his might not be a conventional existence			2
on march 30 , 1852 , @entity8 was stillborn in the @entity9			1
that was his older brother			2
a year later -- to the day -- a second child was born			1
this child , too , was given the name @entity32			2
he would be the boy who grew into an artist			1
he left school at 15			2
he worked as an art dealer , a clergyman and a bookseller			1
he never found material success			0
he battled depression and deep loneliness			2
he famously mutilated his left ear ; he was confined to an asylum			0
his attacks of anxiety and bottomless melancholy kept him in his room for months at a time			0
his brother @entity48 would write that , very near the end , @entity32 said to him : " the sadness will last forever			0
" yet what has lasted forever is his brilliance			0
because of his artistry , @entity8 has proved to be immortal			1
he has been gone for more than a century , and we are talking about him today , studying every detail of his work , trying to decipher what it was he was trying to say on his canvases			0
making art , in any of its myriad forms -- music , literature , drama and beyond -- is like sending messages out in bottles			1
the artists , on the days they drop the bottles into the water , can have no idea where they will end up , or who will find them			0
you do n't have to be an aficionado of fine art to walk into a public gallery , stand before a painting done by someone long dead , and think : one day , many generations ago , whoever created this work decided that this tiny brushstroke here would be preferable to another , subtly different one ; that this shade of red in this corner was the ideal one , instead of a shade more vivid or more muted ; that the shadows over on this side of the canvas were what was needed to set the proper mood			1
and now , all these years later , a stranger standing in front of the painting in a town the artist never visited is thinking about the mind behind those choices			1
walk into a public library			0
pull a book from any shelf			0
the book can be by an acclaimed author -- @entity110 @entity109 , the wonderful writer of @entity111 , @entity112 -- or by an author with whose work you are unfamiliar			2
@entity116 through the book until you find a paragraph that strikes you as being especially beautifully constructed , a paragraph you immediately esteem			0
linger over it , and consider : this writer chose to put this comma here for a reason , for the desired rhythm and cadence ; discerned that this particular combination of words would be most pleasing to the eye and ear of a reader ; pondered , at least momentarily , whether a semicolon was the right way to break a thought , or whether a period followed by the start of a new sentence would serve a reader more gracefully			0
the writer , on that day , may not have known whether his or her book would ever be published			0
maybe the book has sat on this library shelf for years without anyone coming along to free it from its hardbound neighbors			0
but on this day , someone -- you -- has , in fact , come along , and is thinking about what the writer may have been thinking , alone at a typewriter or with a fountain pen poised over a clean sheet of paper , so many years ago			2
that message in a bottle : the writer is alive again -- alive still			1
the work , suddenly , is new once more			0
this is artistry 's payoff , its greatest reward			2
during the summer , the singer @entity161 spoke about an antebellum house that he and his wife had renovated and repaired in @entity164 , @entity165			1
@entity166 , 74 , told @entity167 of the @entity168 that " the house makes me feel kind of solid			0
i like things that are way older than i am and are going to outlast me			0
" but he is being too modest			0
the house is not going to outlast the music of the @entity161 ; eventually and inevitably the house will fall apart or be torn down			1
the songs that @entity175 and @entity166 recorded , though , with their gorgeously blended voices , will never die			0
the brothers themselves , like all artists , will leave this earth , but the harmonies they created will go on and on			0
immortality : now that @entity8 's " @entity14 " has been discovered and authenticated for the world to see , his every artistic choice that reveals itself on the canvas will be peered at and discussed for centuries to come , by admirers hoping to glean further insights into the man he was			1
he painted more than 800 canvases and did more than 1,000 drawings and watercolors			0
he went to his grave a pauper , knowing that , for all his talent and heart and inspiration , he had been able , in his lifetime , to sell only one painting			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : discovery of @entity8 painting points up immortality of the artist
he says @entity8 *struggled* with his art -- and depression -- died young , but art endured
he says art in all its forms is like message in a bottle , sent from the mind of artist to the ages
@entity204 : art , whether @entity161 or @entity8 , keeps artist 's *perceptions* alive
