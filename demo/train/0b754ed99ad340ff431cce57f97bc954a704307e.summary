@entity0 -- president @entity2 is n't giving republicans time to catch their breath after celebrating an election triumph			1
he barnstormed into action following tuesday 's midterm elections , pushing his priorities before @entity10 leaders can frame their agenda for the new @entity12 , which convenes in january			2
@entity2 challenged congressional leaders he met with over lunch friday to back his expanding war against @entity16			1
the president plans to send up to 1,500 more troops to train @entity20 and @entity21 forces while asking @entity12 for another $ 5.6 billion to fund the operation			1
on another front for the busy @entity24 , @entity2 on saturday named @entity26 attorney @entity25 to succeed outgoing attorney general @entity27			1
the move put @entity30 @entity10 leaders -- whose aides said they were not informed ahead of time -- on the defensive			0
in a volley of news releases they insisted that her confirmation should be put off until the majority - @entity10 @entity30 convenes in january			2
@entity2 is also pressing lawmakers to approve $ 6 billion in emergency funding to fight @entity40 before they leave @entity0 for the holidays			1
and the president will head to @entity43 this weekend to show his authority on the world stage has not been splintered by pending @entity10 domination of @entity12			2
the president is operating from a playbook by his chief of staff , @entity49 , that 's been weeks in the making ; it takes him through the lame duck session of @entity12 and his penultimate @entity54 in january			1
one of his next moves , aides say , will be to use his executive power to reshape the nation 's immigration system before the end of the year , despite @entity10 claims he will " poison the well " for future cooperation			2
but @entity2 's time to wield the initiative will be brief			1
come next year , he will be hit with a blizzard of bills from the new @entity12 , including efforts to dismember his signature health care law and policies on climate change			0
as the president fights the dreaded perception he is a lame duck , his strategy can be summed up in three words — show no weakness			0
he is making a clear attempt not to appear morose after an election seen as a repudiation of his administration			0
reporters at a post-election news conference sought to goad @entity2 into admitting culpability for the @entity88 meltdown , but he avoided prolonging the story by giving the election defeat a catchy term similar to " shellacking " -- the word he used in 2010			1
instead he vowed to play the " fourth quarter " of his presidency well			0
the approach is designed to maximize @entity2 's remaining political capital in @entity0 , which will quickly dry up once the 2016 presidential campaign fires up			1
@entity2 will also deny pundits the political firing squad they are demanding , and has no plans for a big staff shakeup			1
even before tuesday 's election , critics had demanded fresh blood in a @entity24 that critics see as sealed off from political reality			1
but aides say the kind of shakeup that helped invigorate other late - term presidencies is not @entity2 's style			1
even now , he is still surrounded by many aides from his 2008 campaign			0
" what i am ruling out ... would be sort of a large - scale public firing , " @entity24 press secretary @entity115 said thursday			0
still , many aides are worn down by the brutal demands of a punishing presidency weighed down by crisis after crisis at home and abroad — so there will be some natural turnover with two years to go			0
but there are no signs @entity2 will make huge changes in the @entity129 or to his cabinet — along the lines of president @entity133 's dismissal of defense secretary @entity134 after the 2006 midterms , when control of @entity12 flipped to the @entity88			1
" there will be some people leaving , but i do n't think there will be a huge shakeup , " said one @entity24 official			0
one difference from 2006 is that the outspoken @entity134 was closely associated with a war that had gone bad — in @entity20 , which was the prominent issue in an election @entity133 referred to as a " thumping			1
" @entity146 allowed @entity133 to reengineer war strategy with his troop surge , which staved off a humiliating defeat in @entity20			1
but other than @entity2 himself , there is no obvious official who encapsulates the failings of this administration , so a satisfying " clearing out " might impress @entity156 insiders but achieve little			2
staff changes that do take place will likely come after the president has recharged his batteries and reflected on the way forward during his annual december vacation in @entity163 , an official and a former administration official said			2
but the big names are staying			0
national security adviser @entity167 , who earned some rough reviews on @entity169 and among some @entity26 allies for her sometimes brusque manner , said friday she was going nowhere			0
" i serve at the pleasure of the president and i will continue to serve as long as he 'd like me to , " said @entity172			0
no one expects defense secretary @entity177 to leave yet , despite whispers about his performance in @entity0			0
the biggest personnel change -- and one of the few that will resonate outside the @entity0 area code , may be the one involving deputy national security adviser @entity185 , whom @entity2 nominated friday as deputy secretary of state			2
the @entity187 reported friday that former @entity26 under - secretary of state @entity188 is the choice of some administration hands to inject new foreign policy bandwidth into the administration			0
but @entity2 's inner circle is notoriously tough to penetrate , a factor that might put off some potential newcomers			1
those mulling their futures include one of @entity2 's longest - serving aides , senior policy adviser @entity201 , a 2008 campaign alumnus , who had several health scares last year			1
@entity129 staffers are not expecting @entity49 to leave			0
but senior adviser @entity205 's self - imposed one - year term limit at the @entity24 is almost up			2
he is tipped to join @entity207 's yet - to - launched presidential campaign			2
ebola czar @entity208 , meanwhile , is likely in line for a more permanent @entity129 policy job			0
deputy communications director @entity212 is also said to be considering her future , while deputy national security adviser @entity214 has not yet made his intentions public			0
many people had expected @entity217 , @entity2 's campaign guru , to return to a @entity24 role after the election			1
but @entity217 is now steering online smartphone taxi service @entity220 as senior vice president .			0

president @entity2 has a fast start after election *debacle*
moving quickly : more *military* advisers for @entity20 , ag nomination , @entity40 funding request
big staff shake - ups have not been @entity2 's style , and that 's unlikely to happen
