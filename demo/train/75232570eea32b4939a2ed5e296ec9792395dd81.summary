gays hoping to join the @entity1 will have to wait until at least may after the organization 's executive board put off a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly homosexual scouts and troop leaders			1
the board had been expected to vote wednesday on a proposal to let local groups set their own policies , but said instead that it needs more time to get comment on the issue from its members			1
" after careful consideration and extensive dialogue within the @entity23 family , along with comments from those outside the organization , the volunteer officers of the @entity19 's @entity18 concluded that due to the complexity of this issue , the organization needs time for a more deliberate review of its membership policy , " the board said in a written statement			1
the decision will now be made at the organization 's annual meeting in may			1
about 1,400 members of the group 's national council will take part during that gathering , the board said			1
in the meantime , the organization will " further engage representatives of @entity23 's membership and listen to their perspectives and concerns			1
" opinion : @entity48 on gays hurts scouting the decision disappointed critics who had hoped to see the organization end its ban despite a 2000 @entity55 ruling saying it had the right to keep it			1
" every day that the @entity19 delay action is another day that discrimination prevails , " said @entity58 president @entity57			1
" now is the time for action			0
@entity63 , gay and straight , are hurt by the inaction associated with today 's news			2
the @entity19 leadership should end this awful policy once and for all , and open the proud tradition of scouting to all			1
" others hope the delay will provide time to lobby the @entity1 to scrap the plan			0
" this issue is not a gay rights issue , " said @entity76 scout leader @entity75			1
" it 's a gender attraction issue and it 's also a politics issue			2
as a local scout leader , i do n't need to worry about gay rights -- that should n't be my role ; that should n't be what i do			1
and to push that decision upon me is not the best way to go			0
" conservative groups and some religious organizations have argued against making any change , saying it would dilute the @entity93 message of morality and potentially destroy the organization			1
the @entity1 announced last month that the organization would consider changing the policy , a sharp reversal of its previous support for excluding openly gay members and scout leaders			1
the new policy would allow local leaders to decide " consistent with each organization 's mission , principles or religious beliefs " whether to open troops they sponsor to openly gay people , the group said in a statement at the time			1
the proposal comes more than a decade after a @entity55 ruling that found the organization has the right to keep gays out , but also amid declining participation in the venerable @entity120 institution			2
membership in @entity1 has declined by about a third since 1999			0
about 2.7 million people now participate in scouting nationwide , with more than 70 % of troops affiliated with a church or religious groups			0
the organization has also endured frequent criticism from gay rights groups and other critics who say the @entity1 should not endorse discrimination			1
activists hail a watershed moment in gay rights movement among more recent controversies , the organization came under fire last year after @entity138 , an @entity139 den leader , was dismissed by her local @entity93 officials for being a lesbian			1
on tuesday , @entity142 delivered a petition she said was signed by 1.4 million people supporting the change			2
before wednesday 's announcement of the delay , she said she was looking forward to the change , but added it would not go far enough			1
" if this ban is lifted , it 's a great first step , " she said wednesday on @entity155 's " @entity154			1
" " but it 's still going to lead to kids being rejected			0
families are still going to be turned away			0
" @entity159 , a troop leader who participated in a prayer vigil outside the @entity1 headquarters wednesday , said her church would pull support from scouting if the change goes through			1
" what happens when we go camping and there 's units that allow gays and homosexuals and there 's units that do n't , how are we going to keep them separated from those units and how are we going to instill in our kids christian values and the biblical truth if that 's allowed in our program ? " she said			0
a poll released monday suggests the public is in favor of lifting the ban			2
the poll , conducted january 30 to february 4 by @entity186 , found 55 % of respondents favored lifting the ban			2
the school said 33 % were opposed			0
the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points			0
president @entity194 , who is honorary president of the national organization by virtue of his office , also supports opening troops to everyone			2
on wednesday , @entity201 spokesman @entity200 said the administration had no comment on the @entity1 decision			2
" you know that the president believes the @entity1 is a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character in @entity120 boys for more than a century , " @entity200 said			2
" he also , as you know , opposes discrimination in all forms			2
and as such , believes -- as he said just on sunday -- that gay @entity63 ought to be able to participate in the @entity1			2
but in terms of the process of their evaluation of their policies , i do n't have a comment			0
" conservative politicians and religious leaders have said that changing the policy would dilute the organization 's voice and mission			1
scouting goes through a rough patch some , including former @entity227 presidential candidate @entity226 , have argued the change could destroy scouting			0
@entity230 of the @entity231 said the change could be a " catastrophe			0
" " what they 've said to us and to other religious leaders is that they are doing this under pressure , and we 're going to give people what basically amounts to a local option , " @entity230 said			0
" you ca n't have a local option of a core conviction			0
" changing the policy against having openly gay leaders or scouts " would be a grave mistake , " the conservative @entity246 and dozens of other groups said in a half - page ad in @entity249 this week			1
the message called on the @entity1 to " show courage " and " stand firm for timeless values			0
" " @entity259 who believes in freedom of thought and religious liberty should be alarmed by the attacks upon the @entity1 , who have had core convictions about morality for 100 years , " the ad said			0
" @entity267 takes an oath to keep himself ' morally straight			0
' @entity270 have every right to include sexual conduct in how they define that term			0
" but others say scouting is suffering because of its policy on gays , not despite it			0
@entity281 @entity280 , founder of @entity282 , says the ban has backfired			0
when he was 10 , @entity285 pack had to find a new home because the @entity19 's policy violated the nondiscrimination rule of the school district that hosted it			1
" i was confused , because my den mother , @entity291 -- who is my actual mother -- was a lesbian , and nobody in our unit had any issue with that , " @entity280 wrote			0
the pack managed to find another sponsor -- a nearby church -- but " some parents pulled their kids from the pack , uncomfortable with entrusting their sons to an organization they believed engaged in discrimination			0

" this issue is not a gay rights issue , " @entity76 scout leader who opposes change says
" end this awful policy , " the @entity58 urges @entity19
the organization said last month it would consider changing its ban on openly gay members
@entity93 leaders put off vote *scheduled* for wednesday ; it will now happen in may
