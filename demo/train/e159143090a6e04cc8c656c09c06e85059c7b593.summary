-- a new study finds that 54 percent of teens talk about behaviors such as sex , alcohol use , and violence on the social networking giant @entity8 -- presenting potential risks even if all they 're doing is talking , researchers said monday			1
do you know what your teen has posted on social networking web sites ? the study looked at @entity8 profiles of 500 people who identified themselves as 18 - year - old males and females in the @entity21			1
references to risky behaviors included both words and photos , the authors said			2
not all teens who write about risky behaviors in their profiles actually engage in them in real life , said dr. @entity32 of the @entity33 , one of the authors of the study , which appears in the january issue of @entity37			1
they may instead talk about sex , substance use , or violence because they are contemplating doing those things , or because they want to brag without actually doing what they say , @entity38 said			0
even if teens have not actually engaged in risky behaviors but merely brag about them online , this can still affect their future behavior , said study co-author dr. @entity48 , professor of pediatrics at the @entity50 and director of the @entity52 at @entity53			1
those who lie about the behaviors to show off may receive positive feedback from others -- comments such as " that 's great " or " i do the same thing " -- that encourage them to actually try out the behaviors , he said			0
apart from that , teens who claim such behaviors are more likely to be victims of bullying and unwanted invitations for sex , he said			0
in a second study , @entity38 and colleagues identified 190 profiles of 18 - to 20 - year - olds that contained three or more references to sexual behaviors or substance abuse			1
the authors then made a profile of their own , called " dr. @entity80 , " from which they sent a single e-mail to half these profiles , warning them about the risky information and offering information about clinical resources			1
they found that , after three months , 42.1 percent of the profile owners who received the e-mail -- and 29.5 percent of those who did not -- either removed references to risky behaviors or made their profiles private			1
" it 's really not that @entity8 is bad or good			0
i think the lesson is that it 's a tool , and how you use it determines the kinds of outcome you 're going to get , " @entity38 said			0
experts say the bottom line is that parents should get more involved in the online lives of their children			2
" i tell parents that they should absolutely create their own @entity8 and @entity103 page , " @entity48 said			2
the study inspired him to create his own @entity103 account , and his 10 - year - old already wants to know about his " friends , " he said			1
in some cases , parents should even have their children 's passwords for these social networking sites , especially when the children are around age 13 or 14 , said @entity115 , child - adolescent psychologist at the @entity116 at @entity117			2
@entity118 was not involved with the study , but she is well aware of the problem			0
one of @entity118 's patients , the daughter of a preacher , posted nude photographs of herself online , a move that cost her father his job , @entity118 said			0
but she said 54 percent as a figure for profiles with risky behaviors seems too high , given that most of what happens on social networking sites is " chit - chat			1
" " i have parents that catch their kids bragging about something on @entity8 , and when you actually confront them , the kid says ' i really was n't doing it , ' and they can prove they were not at the party where they were supposed to have been drinking , " she said			0
beyond keeping a watchful eye on risky interests and pictures , parents should also use social networking sites such as @entity8 -- which had about 120 million users as of this summer -- as an opportunity to learn about their childrens ' favorite movies and hobbies , as well as their top friends , she said			2
" you so often hear parents say ' i do n't even know my kid anymore			0
' here 's a very easy tool to get to know your kid again , " she said			0
