@entity0 -- it was impossible not to be deeply moved by @entity3 when he and his family joined @entity5 live on " @entity6 " on wednesday			2
you see , up until that moment we had been detached			2
we may have seen the bodies of the dead scattered across the eastern @entity11 countryside , distorted , rotting , a dog running from the crash site with something in its mouth			1
seen the scattered belongings , many strangely intact , the house keys , the @entity19 travel guide , the child 's toy perched on top of the wreckage , retrieved by a villager from where it had fallen from the sky			0
we may have dashed along potted roads , finding new routes to avoid the shelling , pleading with the sun not to fall so we could be safer			0
through check point after check point , guns aimed at us			1
convoys of tanks and artillery on those same roads , belonging to both sides and wondered their destination , purpose and origin			0
we may have sat across from the self - appointed prime minister of his self - declared @entity44 and asked him if he and his men , so many of whom are from @entity47 , had shot down the plane			1
eye to eye , asked him if he was backed , armed and incited by @entity47			0
and we joined the @entity51 monitors as they gathered around the train being used to transport the dead from this militia controlled so called @entity44 , and balked with them at the stench , the hacking , repulsive , gut wrenching smell as the refrigerated train door opened to reveal desperate , bagged and reeking cargo			1
@entity61 : what happens to the victims ' bodies next ? but standing in front of a family who lost two of their children , ten year old @entity67 and nineteen year old @entity70			1
two bright lives , crushed by mistake or design			0
looking at their mother , far too emotional to even speak			1
we came off air for a commercial break , but actually it was a break down			1
we 'd covered every angle of the story in @entity82 and standing in @entity0 's @entity0 , the origin of that desperate flight , surrounded by those paying their respects , laying flowers on @entity89 's day of national mourning			0
as journalists we are often fickle and fleeting in our gaze , but we remain proud and committed to impartiality			2
too often impartiality breeds a lack of empathy , not wanting to be drawn too close to one side or the other			0
for the @entity3 family , and those just like them , ripped apart , bereft and desperate for answers , this was never their war			0
we stood together , in front of the camera and then behind it , and we mourned too			0
mother of two @entity109 's fears @entity1 's @entity5 contributed to this report			1
watch @entity6 weekdays at 6am - 9am et. for the latest on @entity6 click here			2

meeting the mother of victims 10 - year - old @entity67 and 19 - year - old @entity70 caused @entity1 journalists to break down
the journalists saw dead bodies , had guns aimed at them at check points and were present when the dead were transported
