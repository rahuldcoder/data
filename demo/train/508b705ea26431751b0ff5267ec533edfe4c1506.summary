-- could the days of trying to cram all your professional accomplishments onto a single sheet of paper be a thing of the past ? some job experts say we 're already there			1
with news that @entity12 might be joining the ranks of online - employment brokers , it 's looking more and more like the old - fashioned resume might be growing obsolete			1
@entity12 plans to launch its own jobs board , working with some existing sites to let users search listings , the @entity20 is reporting			1
yes , that 's right : people may be looking for jobs on the same site where photos of their youthful indiscretions could turn off potential employers			2
it 's not certain whether such a @entity12 feature will pan out ( @entity12 is n't commenting , and the @entity20 cites unnamed sources )			1
but in many ways , we 're already in a post-resume era			0
what hiring manager is going to make a decision based on an e-mail attachment when they can browse your @entity40 and @entity12 profiles , read the gory details in your blog and hit @entity44 to find out more about you -- good or bad -- all in one sitting ? and paper resumes ? forget it			1
between desktops , laptops , tablets and smartphones , some hiring experts say there 's little reason to peruse a dead - tree summary of someone 's career anymore			0
" i do n't ever have anybody come in and hand me a paper resume , " said @entity59 , a principal at @entity60 , a staffing firm in @entity61 , @entity62			1
" ten years ago , your fax machine was loaded when you came in in the morning			0
" @entity59 blogged about the trend in january , writing that when someone hands her a paper resume at a job fair , she hands it back and asks for an e-mail			1
why ? " because that paper resume has little chance of leaving my roll - along briefcase , which houses my laptop , @entity75 and other electronics , " she wrote			1
" our entire recruiting process is now online			0
" technically , @entity79 , who works on community engagement in @entity81 for software company @entity82 , submitted a resume for her job			2
but it was just one digital blip that was " pinned " on a @entity88 board she created			2
other pins included a listing of her public speaking engagements , links to news articles in which she 'd appeared , her blog and even an article on how to build a resume on @entity88			2
she dubbed it her " @entity102 , " what she called " an ongoing collection of decidedly cool things i 've done in my career , side gigs , and other projects			0
" some companies , especially those in the tech world , are going even further , saying they 're no longer interested at all in an applicant 's tried - and - true laundry list of jobs , education , awards and activities			2
hiring managers often can gain a better sense of a person 's judgment , personality and communication skills by perusing their @entity126 feeds or @entity128 posts , they say			1
@entity129 , a @entity130 venture - capitalist firm that invests heavily in tech start - ups , hired two analysts last month after a search that started last fall			1
but instead of soliciting resumes when the positions were announced , the firm asked for a glimpse at applicants ' " web presence			1
" " this could be anything from a @entity126 account to a blog or @entity128 to a project you hacked together -- whatever represents you best , " @entity141 's @entity140 wrote on the company 's site at the time			1
" we expect your web presence to represent who you are , not who you think an employer wishes you were , so please do n't waste time sanitizing your web presence before sending us there			0
" applicants also were asked to create two web videos of themselves , one saying why they wanted the job and the other answering the question : ' " which web or mobile services most inspire you ? " @entity59 does n't think most employers are going to go that far , at least not in the near future			1
but she already uses many of the tools @entity141 did to augment what a job applicant provides on their own			2
" we look at @entity12 ; we look at @entity40 , " she said			2
" we love to see what you 've done on @entity177			0
that makes that person more three - dimensional			0
" she suspects resumes are here for a while longer , but they may take new forms			0
" the concept is not changing			0
that document , your life history of your work , is n't ever going to be obsolete , " she said			0
" it 's the vehicle that i think is changing			0
" so , if @entity40 and @entity126 have replaced the fax machine of 10 years ago , what might a resume look like a decade from now ? " i 'm waiting for holograms			1
oh , come on : ' @entity196 , ' " she said , referring to the image of a miniature princess @entity194 from the 1977 movie			0
" we were promised it way back then			0
if you want a serious answer , i think that 's where the technology is going to take us			0

thanks to growing number of web tools , some say the resume is already obsolete
job recruiter says she never accepts a paper resume
one @entity130 firm asked for @entity126 , blog posts , videos -- but not resumes
reports say @entity12 may be launching a jobs board
