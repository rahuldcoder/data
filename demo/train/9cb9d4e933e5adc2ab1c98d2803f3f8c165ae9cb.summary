there 's a lot of information out there on the @entity5 crisis			0
and now , the issue 's gone political with increasingly vocal talk on @entity8 and in midterm campaigns calling for a travel ban to keep the disease from spreading in the @entity12 let 's sort through the muck and get to the facts : what 's all this talk about a travel ban to deal with the @entity5 outbreak ? some @entity21 lawmakers and a handful of @entity23 are calling for a travel ban on people from the @entity27 countries most affected by the disease			1
in @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 , more than 4,400 people have died of the disease and one person has died of the disease in the @entity12 that patient was diagnosed and ultimately died at a @entity36 hospital and now gov. @entity37 is joining calls for a travel ban after two nurses at the hospital contracted the disease			1
" air travel is , in fact , how this disease crosses borders and it 's certainly how it got to @entity36 in the first place , " @entity37 said			0
" i believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the @entity5 outbreak			2
" gov. @entity50 of @entity51 said saturday that such a travel ban " makes sense			1
" his state is on high alert after @entity56 , the second @entity57 nurse to fall ill , flew to @entity58 and spent four days there after she had contracted the virus			0
but health experts at the @entity62 and @entity63 are n't recommending a travel ban , and @entity62 chief dr. @entity65 has even said the ban could hurt efforts to prevent an outbreak in the @entity12 has the @entity12 ever enforced that kind of a blanket travel ban ? not really			1
the @entity12 has not banned people from a certain country from coming to the @entity12 because of an epidemic			2
but president @entity74 in 1987 did ban anyone infected with hiv / aids from entering in the @entity12			1
and for more than 20 years , that was @entity12 government policy until president @entity79 struck it down in 2009			2
that travel ban came at a time when @entity82 was heavily stigmatized in the @entity12 and amid misinformation and some public fear that the disease could spread through casual contact			1
anyway , there 's not much evidence to suggest that travel ban was successfully enforced or effective			1
today , more than 1.1 million people are hiv positive			0
but remember , @entity5 is nothing like @entity82 according to @entity92 ( and @entity65 ) @entity93			0
wait , just checking , @entity5 ca n't be spread through the air right ? @entity96 , no , no. the ebola virus is only spread through contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has started showing symptoms of the disease			0
and while some have stoked fears that the disease could go airborne , the @entity63 and other experts have said the chances that could happen are near to nil and are unaware of a virus that has ever mutated in that way			0
can you catch @entity5 on a plane ? what about epidemics like @entity112 and swine flu that have infected and killed way more people than @entity5 ? why were n't there travel bans for those outbreaks ? nope			1
no travel bans for those diseases			1
swine flu , also known as @entity122 flu , killed more than 284,000 people between 2009 and 2010 according to the @entity62 -- of which about 12,000 @entity12			1
the @entity63 did not recommend a travel ban then either			2
and the @entity12 never banned travel from @entity127 , the epicenter of the 2003 @entity112 outbreak , which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven - month period as the @entity5 epidemic			1
in fact , @entity12 airports never implemented @entity112 passenger screenings at airports at a time when many other countries did			1
so why are politicians so certain a travel ban is the right way to go here ? simply put , a lot of members of @entity145 just want to keep the disease out of the @entity12 and prevent any more cases from spring up at home			1
and they believe the best way to do that is to bar anyone who 's been in @entity27 recently -- or who has a passport from one of those countries			0
@entity12 health officials grilled on @entity5 at congressional hearing rep. @entity160 , who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over @entity5 on thursday , insisted airport screenings are n't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms			1
and rep. @entity168 said @entity5 " needs to be solved in @entity27 , but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in			0
" ok , that sounds like it makes sense			0
why are health experts saying the ban 's a bad idea ? the @entity62 's @entity65 gets why that 's the knee - jerk reaction to such a deadly disease			2
but a ban might actually make things worse , he said , because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to @entity27			2
and without that crucial information , @entity65 said people infected with @entity5 could slip into the @entity12 without the @entity62 being able to track and monitor them for symptoms			0
but are n't more than two dozen @entity27 countries now enforcing some kind of travel ban ? yes			1
a few of the neighboring @entity27 countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those @entity27 countries			0
but it 's not clear how effective those bans are at keeping @entity200 out in a region known for especially porous borders			0
" even when governments restrict travel and trade , people in affected countries still find a way to move and it is even harder to track them systematically , " @entity65 said last week			0
so you 're saying it probably would n't work ? nope			2
at least not according to health officials			2
in fact , there are no direct flights to the @entity12 from either @entity216 , @entity30 or @entity32 , the three most affected countries			0
there are direct flights from @entity220 , which has dealt with 20 cases , but that country has been much more effective in containing the outbreak			0
latest @entity5 developments how else could a travel ban hurt ? the ban would especially hurt efforts in @entity27 to contain the disease , where foreign health care workers have been central to the fight against the epidemic			1
and if @entity12 health workers are afraid they ca n't return to the @entity12 , they might decide not to go at all			2
preventing the disease from spreading further in @entity27 is crucial to keep @entity5 from continuing to spread			0

the last time the @entity12 enforced some kind of health - *related* travel ban was with hiv / aids .
the @entity12 did n't enforce travel bans with the more *contagious* @entity112 and swine flu epidemics .
top health officials say a ban would n't work and would make the problem worse .
