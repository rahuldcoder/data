-- divergent was dauntless at the box office this weekend , easily winning the top spot with an estimated $ 56 million			1
meanwhile , the @entity4 failed to take multiplexes in @entity4 , earning $ 16.5 million , and the faith - based indie @entity6 inspired an awesome $ 8.6 million from just 780 theaters			1
starring @entity11 and @entity12 as rebels in a dystopian future , the @entity10 action film divergent aimed for the same moviegoers who gave @entity16 a surprise $ 152.5 million opening weekend in march , 2012			1
with a $ 56 million debut , @entity18 did n't reach those heights — and even fell slightly below the predictions of some analysts , who had pegged the movie for a $ 60 million - plus debut			1
like many buzzy films , it started strong out of the gate : a teen - targeted marketing blitz transformed the movie into an event for young fans , who turned out in droves for late - night thursday screenings that grossed $ 4.9 million even before the official start of the weekend			2
critical reaction has been lackluster , though the film earned a solid @entity37 and praise from @entity0 's @entity39 , who called it an " agreeably rousing , sensitive - teen - in - @entity44 - linen - finds - her - inner - tattooed - jock - to - fight - the - power formula dystopian thriller			2
" regardless , a sequel , @entity49 , has already been greenlit by @entity50 for release on march 20 , 2015			0
the trilogy 's finale , @entity54 , is scheduled for march 18 , 2016 , showing @entity56 's continued faith in spring as a box - office launchpad after the success of recent march hits like @entity16 ( $ 408 million total ) and @entity60 ( $ 234 million )			0
( however , after the first @entity63 installment 's release , @entity50 did bump the remainder of the trilogy into the more competitive @entity67 time frame			0
) @entity0 : ' divergent ' - did it get trashed for coming after ' @entity16 ' ? the weekend 's other wide release , @entity4 , proved that it 's still not easy being green — at least at the box office : budgeted at a reported $ 50 million , @entity71 's kid - friendly adventure made $ 16.5 million in its debut			1
despite a pack of big - name , live - action co-stars ( @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , et al ) , @entity80 and his gang failed to bring in the same crowds who racked up a $ 29.2 million opening for the 2011 franchise reboot , the @entity4			1
( that film stalled at $ 88.6 million domestically , and its co-writer - star @entity86 was n't involved in @entity4			1
) @entity88 's beloved characters have a long and troubled big - screen history , stretching back to 1979 ′ s @entity90 ; 2011 ′ s the @entity4 is the highest grosser in the series , while the 1999 flop @entity93 marks the group 's low point , with a $ 16.6 million total			1
@entity0 : ' @entity18 ' stars @entity12 and @entity11 talk pushups and injuries -- listen ! part of the @entity4 ' problem might 've been the holdover success of mr. @entity104 ( also featuring the voice of @entity78 ) , which offered stiff competition for family audiences and came in third with $ 11.7 million			1
now in its third weekend , the @entity111 adventure has drawn up $ 81 million and is a likely candidate for a sequel			2
in fourth place , the @entity114 : @entity116 slayed another $ 8.7 million in ticket receipts , lifting its cumulative gross to $ 93.8 million			0
the biggest surprise of the weekend is undoubtedly the success of @entity6 , an inspirational drama about a college student who defends his belief in @entity123 against a non-believing professor			1
with no marquee stars ( @entity127 and @entity128 appear in the film , as does @entity131 star @entity130 ) and little mainstream press , the film earned $ 8.6 million from just 780 @entity134 title benefited from a highly specific marketing plan that involved drumming up social buzz ( the film has over 1 million likes on @entity139 ) and partnering with the christian music festival @entity140 to raise awareness in its target audience			2
2014 is shaping up to be a bellwether year for faith - based films : last month , the religious - themed @entity145 opened to an impressive $ 25.6 million , while @entity148 's biblical opus @entity149 hits theaters next weekend amid a swirl of controversy			0
here 's how the top five played out : 1			0
divergent -- $ 56 million 2			0
@entity4 -- $ 16.5 million 3			1
mr. @entity104 -- $ 11.7 million 4			0
300 : rise of an @entity155 -- $ 8.7 million 5			0
@entity6 -- $ 8.6 million in limited release , @entity156 welcomed $ 7 million worth of new sales thanks to an expansion from 66 to 304 theaters			2
with a $ 13.2 million total in its third week of release , the whimsical dramedy is already hot on the heels of director @entity166 's biggest hits , @entity167 ( final gross : $ 45.5 million ) and 2001 ′ s @entity169 ( $ 52.4 million )			0
