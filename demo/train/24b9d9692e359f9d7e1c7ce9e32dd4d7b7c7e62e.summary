a federal judge on wednesday denied @entity2 suspect @entity4 's bid to move the location of his upcoming trial , even while moving back its scheduled start date			1
explaining his decision to have a jury weigh @entity4 's fate near where the bombings and subsequent violent incidents with police occurred , @entity9 district judge @entity8 said , " although the media coverage in this case has been extensive , at this stage the defendant has failed to show that it has so inflamed and pervasively prejudiced the pool that a fair and impartial jury can not be impaneled in the ( eastern division of the @entity25 )			1
" @entity8 's ruling means that the trial in one of the most scarring episodes in @entity31 history will stay in @entity31			2
with his older brother @entity32 , @entity4 is accused of planting two explosives hidden inside backpacks on april 15 , 2013 , along downtown @entity31 's busy @entity35 near the marathon 's finish line			1
the bombs exploded 12 seconds apart , killing 8 - year - old @entity39 , 29 - year - old @entity40 and @entity41 , a @entity42 graduate student from @entity43 , and injuring more than 200 others			2
mourning , resolve and quest for answers after deadly bombs three days later , a @entity50 police officer named @entity51 was shot and killed on campus -- allegedly by the bombing suspects			1
then , early on april 19 , authorities say the @entity4 brothers hijacked a car in nearby @entity57 , then exchanged gunfire and thew explosives out the window when police began to chase them			1
@entity62 died in that exchange			0
his younger brother was n't found until the next day , bloodied and in a boat parked in a @entity68 , @entity67 , backyard			1
the marathon bombings and subsequent manhunt spurred intense media coverage in @entity67 and beyond			0
" @entity80 " became an often repeated mantra in the region as locals rallied in support of one another and in opposition to those behind the violence			0
the attention spurred @entity4 to ask for his trial to be moved out of @entity67 , his lawyers arguing " that pretrial publicity and public sentiment " jeopardized his opportunity for a fair trial			1
@entity8 shot down the defense case on several grounds , including the argument that 12 impartial jurors could n't be found in the area			2
he noted that @entity67 ' eastern federal district has about 5 million people			0
" it stretches the imagination to suggest that an impartial jury can not be successfully selected from this large pool of potential jurors , " the judge wrote			1
it 's not like only @entity67 residents know about this case , he added			2
for a time , this was a huge international story -- meaning that people from coast - to - coast , and not just around @entity31 , might have formed opinions about it he said			0
" it is doubtful whether a jury could be selected anywhere in the country whose members were wholly unaware of the marathon bombings , " @entity8 said			0
@entity4 faces more than 30 federal charges tied to the entire episode , including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death			0
bomb suspect pleads not guilty federal prosecutors announced earlier this year that they will seek the death penalty against him , arguing he acted in " an especially heinous , cruel and depraved manner " and lacks remorse			0
while @entity4 was n't able to move his trial location , he did win -- at least partially -- in one regard wednesday : his trial date has been delayed			1
the defense had asked that the trial be pushed back from november 3 to september 1 , 2015 , due to the large volume of information -- or " discovery " -- in the case			0
@entity8 delayed the trial until january 5 , 2015 , not long after the final pretrial conference hearing set for december 18 .			0

@entity4 is accused in the @entity2 , killing police officer
he wants to move the trial out of @entity67 , saying he ca n't get a fair trial there
a judge denies his request , saying an " impartial jury " can be impaneled in the area
@entity4 's trial is being delayed , though , until early next year
