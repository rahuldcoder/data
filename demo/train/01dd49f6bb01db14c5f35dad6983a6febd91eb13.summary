the @entity0 on tuesday upheld a @entity2 law banning the use of racial criteria in college admissions , a key decision in an unfolding legal and political battle nationally over affirmative action			1
the justices found 6 - 2 that a lower court did not have the authority to set aside the measure approved in a 2006 referendum supported by 58 % of voters			1
it bars publicly funded colleges from granting " preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin			1
" justice @entity26 reacted sharply in disagreeing with the decision			0
" for members of historically marginalized groups , which rely on the federal courts to protect their constitutional rights , the decision can hardly bolster hope for a vision of democracy that preserves for all the right to participate meaningfully and equally in self - government , " @entity26 wrote			0
but three justices in the majority , chief justice @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
concluded that the lower court did not have the authority to set aside the law			1
" this case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved			2
it is about who may resolve it , " @entity38 wrote			0
" @entity2 voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials who were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting race - based preferences that raises difficult and delicate issues , " he added			1
justices @entity62 , @entity64 and @entity65 voted in the majority as part of concurring opinions			0
@entity26 and justice @entity69 dissented , and justice @entity70 took no part in the case			0
the court 's first @entity74 justice , @entity26 , took the unusual step of reading part of her powerful dissent from the bench , taking more than 15 minutes to express her concern about the ruling 's impact			1
" this refusal to accept the stark reality that race matters is regrettable			0
the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race , and to apply the @entity94 with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination , " she said			2
" as members of the judiciary tasked with intervening to carry out the guarantee of equal protection , we ought not sit back and wish away , rather than confront , the racial inequality that exists in our society , " she added			0
the latest step the decision was the latest step in a legal and political battle over whether state colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing what students to admit			2
the debate in recent years has centered around whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met			1
last year , the court affirmed the use of race at the @entity122 , but made it harder for institutions to justify such policies to achieve diversity			2
in that dispute , a white student said the college 's existing affirmative action policy violated her " equal protection " rights			1
civil rights supporters of such programs claim @entity2 's ban also has the same effect , and a federal appeals court agreed			1
the @entity0 ruled in 2003 that while state universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit , they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted			0
@entity2 has said minority enrollment at its flagship university , the @entity145 , has not gone down since the measure was passed			2
civil rights groups dispute those figures and say other states have seen fewer @entity151 and @entity152 students attending highly competitive schools , especially in graduate level fields like law , medicine , and science			2
" students deserve a robust education where a variety of viewpoints are shared and debated , " said professor @entity158 of the @entity145 , one of the original plaintiffs			0
" proposal 2 has meant less diversity in our universities , which has had a chilling effect on the quality of discourse in the classroom			0
unfortunately , that will continue , at least for the time being , in @entity2			2
" but supporters of @entity2 's policies applauded the high court 's conclusions			1
" the court emphasized the value of allowing hotly contested policy decisions to be debated in the states rather than encouraging one - size - fits - all orders from @entity185 , " said @entity178 , chief counsel for @entity179			2
" in preserving for the states and the people the right to pursue race - neutral policies with respect to hiring and higher education , the court reaffirmed the blessings of liberty and equality under law for another generation , " @entity186 said			1
controversial efforts the @entity2 ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions			1
but the current high court case dealt only with the college admissions portion			0
efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial			0
the @entity211 high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools , but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states that initially refused to integrate			2
in the 1978 @entity219 case , the justices ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity , and that allows for the use of affirmative action			1
that issue involved a discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to medical school			0
the referendum issue has been around at least since 1996 , when @entity233 voters endorsed @entity234 209 , which bans use of race , sex , or ethnic background by state agencies in areas of education , and government hiring and contracts			0
six other states now have similar laws , and others may follow suit			0
" with today 's opinion , the court has placed responsibility for affirmative action squarely in the hands of the states			1
state universities can choose to adopt affirmative action admissions programs , and state voters can choose to discontinue them , " said @entity254 , a law professor at the @entity255			1
" the fact that this relatively simple judgment generated five separate opinions by the justices , however , points to a much more nuanced and heated debate among the justices regarding the permissibility and wisdom of racial preferences in general , " @entity254 said			0
@entity37 has made the issue a key part of the court 's docket in recent years and it could serve as a major legacy of the current conservative majority			1
the case is @entity276 v. @entity277 to defend @entity278 ( 12 - 682 )			0
i was an affirmative action ' imposter '			1

key argument in opinion concludes that lower court did *n't* have authority to set aside @entity2 law
@entity2 law bars publicly funded colleges from granting preferential treatment on the basis of race
the debate centers on whether affirmative action programs would be phased out in the *future*
it 's now possible that other states could seek to act on affirmative action
