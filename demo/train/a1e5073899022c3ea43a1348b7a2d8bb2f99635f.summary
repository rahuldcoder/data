seeking a middle ground between calls for tough military action and none at all , president @entity0 said thursday he was sending up to 300 military advisers to @entity6 to help the embattled government hold off a lightning advance from the north by @entity11 militants			1
@entity0 told @entity13 reporters the goal was to prevent a civil war in @entity6 that could destabilize the region , and also prevent creation of a terrorist safe haven in northern @entity6 and neighboring @entity22 from which @entity20 enemies could plan and launch attacks against @entity20 interests			1
at the same time , @entity0 sought to allay fears of a military escalation that could relaunch the eight - year war he halted by withdrawing @entity20 troops in 2011			2
" we have had advisers in @entity6 through our embassy and we are prepared to send a small number of additional @entity20 military advisers -- up to 300 -- to assess how we can best train , advise and support @entity6 security forces going forward , " the president said			1
" @entity20 forces will not be returning to combat in @entity6 but we will help @entity6 as they take the fight to terrorists who threaten the @entity6 people , the region and @entity20 interests as well , " he added			1
@entity0 also said his strategy meant that " going forward , we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it			2
" possible airstrikes the language signaled possible airstrikes against the @entity51 in @entity6 and @entity22 ( @entity52 ) fighters who have swept toward @entity54 in recent weeks			2
senior administration officials told reporters after @entity0 's statement that the @entity20 will be sending the advisers to multiple joint command locations in @entity54 and elsewhere in @entity6			1
several initial teams of about a dozen special forces members from units in the region would begin arriving in @entity6 soon , said one of the officials on a @entity13 phone conference conducted on condition of anonymity			0
earlier , several @entity20 officials told @entity70 that the @entity71 proposed sending @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 to @entity6 as military advisers and to collect intelligence			1
the term military adviser evokes memories of the @entity79 , when the @entity20 government used that label for initial @entity20 forces sent over in what ended up as a long and costly engagement			1
@entity20 officials acknowledged the @entity20 military advisers would likely face danger based on their location			0
boots on the ground @entity70 military analyst @entity90 said the decision amounts to @entity20 " boots on the ground " in @entity6 , no matter how the administration characterizes it			1
" this is the first step			0
this is how you get drawn into these situations , " said @entity90 , adding that the mission must be clearly defined to avoid greater military involvement			0
in response to questions from reporters after his statement , @entity0 rejected criticism that bringing home troops from @entity6 three years ago contributed to the current crisis , saying it was @entity6 prime minister @entity110 who rejected a residual force agreement over the need for a core requirement that would immunize @entity114			2
@entity115 troops from local prosecution			0
@entity0 also made clear that he blamed @entity110 for worsening @entity6 's deep sectarian divide by failing to include @entity11 and @entity120 interests in his policies			1
he called on a new @entity6 government recently elected to adopt more inclusive policies , and said he was sending secretary of state @entity124 to the region to promote such an approach			0
@entity20 sources say @entity124 is expected to travel to @entity6 soon			2
" unless there is a coming together and elimination of the mistrust and addressing of the sense of isolation of different segments of @entity6 society -- unless people are brought together in order to try to bring the country together it 's going to be -- there is no single military solution , " @entity124 told reporters on thursday			2
new government on the @entity13 call , a senior administration official said a main goal of the moves announced by @entity0 was to allow the constitutional process of setting up a new @entity6 government to occur within the legally required time frame			0
the freshly elected @entity151 will choose a new prime minister and president , and the @entity0 administration has signaled the need for a different approach than the sectarian polices of @entity110			0
to conservative hawks in @entity160 , @entity0 's moves did n't go far enough			1
" we are deeply concerned that the president continues to make political change in @entity6 the prerequisite for greater @entity20 military and other actions that could begin reversing the momentum of @entity52 and improving the security situation in the country , " said a statement by @entity163 sens. @entity162 of @entity164 and @entity165 of @entity166 , two leading critics of what they consider to be the president 's soft foreign policy			1
@entity20 officials familiar with the @entity71 plan , who spoke to @entity70 on condition of not being identified , said the teams of military advisers would be placed around @entity6 in the headquarters of @entity6 military brigades and tasked with gathering intelligence on @entity52 forces , such as their location , numbers and weaponry			1
such information could provide needed intelligence if @entity0 decides to proceed with airstrikes on @entity52 fighters , as requested by @entity6			1
@entity54 tense as military seeks to halt @entity52 militants ' advance airstrikes an option for days , military sources have said @entity52 fighters are dispersed and mixed in with local populations , making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes			1
@entity90 noted that the @entity20 special forces would be " in a great position to call in any air strikes " if @entity0 decided to use that option , too			2
on wednesday , the president met with congressional leaders and later with @entity124 on the @entity6 crisis , which has prompted @entity163 criticism of @entity20 foreign policy in the hyper - partisan environment of an election year in @entity215			2
according to a @entity13 statement , @entity0 went over efforts to " strengthen the capacity of @entity6 's security forces to confront the threat " from @entity52 fighters , " including options for increased security assistance			1
" earlier , spokesman @entity224 spelled out one limit to any help , saying : " the president has n't ruled out anything except sending @entity20 combat troops into @entity6			2
" congressional authorization while the @entity13 statement emphasized @entity0 would continue to consult with @entity160 , @entity232 @entity163 leader @entity231 of @entity233 said the president " basically just briefed us on the situation in @entity6 and indicated he did n't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take			1
" @entity231 @entity242 of @entity243 agreed with @entity245 's assessment , adding she believed congressional authorization for military force in @entity6 back in 2001 and 2003 still applied			0
a few hours earlier , defense secretary @entity248 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity249 said they were working out details on possible @entity20 steps that could include airstrikes on @entity52 fighters			1
the two leaders agreed with senators on a budget subcommittee that the @entity6 crisis amounted to a threat to @entity20 interests in the region and , down the road , a possible threat to the homeland if northern @entity6 and neighboring @entity22 become a safe haven for @entity266 - affiliated @entity265			0
@entity124 : @entity20 would communicate with @entity267 , not work with it , against @entity52 @entity215 politics @entity0 has advocated less unilateral @entity20 intervention abroad than his predecessor , @entity163 president @entity270 , who led @entity20 into wars in @entity6 and @entity272 following the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
republicans hoping to win control of the @entity232 and maintain their @entity13 majority in the november election have sought to depict @entity0 's foreign policy as weak and ineffective			0
they claim that a @entity20 failure to intervene more forcefully on behalf of @entity22 opposition forces created an opening for the @entity11 militant movement now marching toward @entity54			0
house speaker @entity283 , who attended the @entity13 meeting with @entity0 a day earlier , told reporters on thursday that the @entity6 crisis amounted to a broader foreign policy failure by the administration			0
" when you look it is not just @entity6 , " the @entity288 @entity163 said			0
" it is @entity292 , it 's @entity293 , it 's @entity22			0
the spread of terrorism has increased exponentially under this president 's leadership			0
" administration officials blame @entity6 's crisis on the failure of prime minister @entity110 to govern more inclusively over a nation with major sectarian divisions , especially between the @entity11 - dominated north and @entity304 - dominated south			2
@entity306 sen. @entity305 of @entity243 , the head of the @entity307 , said @entity110 needs to be convinced that his retirement would be in his country 's best interest			0
" i think that most of us that have followed this are really convinced that the @entity110 government , candidly , has got to go if you want any reconciliation , " she said this week			0
other democrats grudgingly supported @entity0 's announcement			0
" to help @entity6 contain the current violence and protect our national security interests , i support president @entity0 's decision to deploy a very limited number of advisers to @entity6 for a non-combat training mission , " said a statement thursday by senate majority leader @entity320 of @entity321			1
he said that " any @entity20 role in @entity6 must remain sharply limited in scope , " arguing that government funds should be for rebuilding infrastructure at home instead of more war in @entity6			0
