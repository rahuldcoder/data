-- @entity1 has a battle on its hands if it is to win back the hearts and minds of the smartphone - buying public			1
earnings are down , sales are down , and now the company is battling rumors that it is pulling out of the consumer market altogether			1
the company 's biggest challenge in the coming months is to prove to business and consumers alike , that they have the ability to match the @entity17 , @entity18 , and even the @entity20 juggernauts that are heading off into the distance with their customers			2
thirteen years ago , when i spotted my first blackberry in @entity27 airport in @entity28 , the @entity30 businessman holding the device drew a crowd			0
at the time we were all amazed and impressed by his ability to check and send emails on the go from a device that fitted in his pocket			0
but @entity1 's biggest problem is that its key selling point -- email -- is no longer a key differentiator in the battle for the best handset			1
email is a given , and while secure email appeals to some , it is not a requirement of the majority			0
that has left @entity1 with a problem that is forcing them to refocus and button down what they offer			2

the cto that chooses your company phone does n't care whether you 'll want to play @entity72 on it -- he cares that the emails you send are secure and the phone lasts long enough so your team members can reach you if you 've left the office			0
at the other end of @entity1 's marketplace is the consumer youth market			1
parents are happy to go @entity25 because they are cheap to run , offer @entity82 to their kids for talking to their other friends , and do n't cost a fortune to buy			2
and therein lies the problem			0
the latest earnings seem to demonstrate that people no longer tend to buy @entity25 , they have them bought for them by work and by their parents			2
the challenge is for @entity1 to show that it is still relevant , that it has n't given up the fight , and that it does still have the ammunition to fight back			1
@entity96 , the company 's managing director of global sales and marketing , has said that the rumors of @entity1 pulling out of the consumer market are wholly inaccurate and that the company is merely refocusing efforts on its core strengths			1
for @entity1 that means its enterprise customer base is now once again a key focus			0
it 's got to make sure the bits of the company that work , work smoothly , and bring in the supplies to support the rest of the business for the fight ahead			0
if @entity1 loses that core business to @entity18 , or @entity20 , or @entity115 -- who are all nipping at @entity1 's heals for the business sector -- then there will only be one fruit - named company left to talk about , and that would be a terrible shame			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity125 .			0

the @entity25 maker fights *speculation* that is pulling out of the consumer market
@entity1 has been hit by low earnings and sales amid *intense* *competition*
today , virtually every phone not only has email , but also apps and *internet* *connectivity*
@entity1 's challenge is to show that it is still relevant and can still fight its rivals
