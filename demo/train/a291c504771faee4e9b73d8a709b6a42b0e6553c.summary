@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 offered their own proposal monday in the heated battle to avert the so - called fiscal cliff , but it was quickly rebuffed by president @entity8 's administration for not demanding more from the nation 's wealthiest taxpayers			1
the @entity2 plan promises $ 2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade , including $ 800 billion from tax reform , $ 600 billion from @entity16 reforms and other health savings and $ 600 billion in other spending cuts , @entity3 @entity2 leadership aides said			1
it also pledges $ 200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index , a measure of inflation			0
house speaker @entity24 called it a " credible plan that deserves serious consideration by the @entity3			1
" the move follows spitting back and forth in recent weeks , with each side claiming the other is n't sincere about striking a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts in january , a scenario many economists say would hurt the @entity37 economy			1
senior @entity8 administration officials slammed the @entity2 plan , calling it a step backward in negotiations and not worthy of its own counteroffer because it is n't serious enough			1
opinion : beware the fiscal cliff deniers @entity3 spokesman @entity47 criticized it for not meeting " the test of balance			2
" another @entity8 spokesman , @entity51 , earlier said the president " will not sign a bill that extends those tax rates for the top 2 % , " as the @entity2 proposal would do			1
" until the @entity2 in @entity57 are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates , we wo n't be able to achieve a significant , balanced approach to reduce our deficit , " @entity47 said			1
@entity2 make budget counter-offer republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a @entity3 vote -- which @entity24 has so far prevented -- on a measure already approved by the @entity68 to extend tax cuts for families making less than $ 250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to @entity73 - era levels for wealthier households			1
lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010			2
in line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign , @entity8 's deficit - reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost $ 1 trillion over 10 years , a significant cut of a $ 4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal			1
in addition to adding a $ 50 billion stimulus package , his proposal closes loopholes , limits deductions , raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends			2
opinion : a tax we could learn to love yet @entity2 , led by @entity24 , have objected to any increase in tax rates , even for the wealthiest @entity37			1
they have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the @entity16 government - run health - care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the poor			0
their plan offered monday proposed $ 800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform , including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes			2
the @entity2 letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by @entity119 , a @entity120 and one - time @entity3 chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by @entity8 in 2010			1
" this is by no means an adequate long - term solution , as resolving our long - term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform , " the letter said			0
" indeed , the @entity119 plan is exactly the kind of imperfect , but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs			0
" @entity2 , break @entity134 's grip on you in his response , @entity47 said the @entity2 proposal " includes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate , which loopholes they will close or which @entity16 savings they would achieve			0
" " independent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires , " he said			0
and @entity119 denied any direct connection to the @entity2 proposal , saying it reflected his view of a middle - ground approach a year ago but " circumstances have changed since then			0
" " it is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today , " @entity119 said			0
recent posturing on both sides -- such as @entity24 saying this weekend he was " flabbergasted " by @entity8 's plan -- reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left @entity57 with a reputation for dysfunction			2
5 ways you would stop the fiscal cliff in 2011 , republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling , a fight that contributed to a @entity37 credit rating downgrade			0
the end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis , which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of $ 1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement			2
experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new @entity57 is seated in january will cause economic turmoil and threaten the @entity37 credit rating			2
the non-partisan @entity196 estimates that middle - class families would pay about $ 2,000 a year more in taxes without action			0
according to a @entity1 / @entity200 released last week , 56 % of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower - income people , while 36 % said taxes should be kept low to create jobs			0
listen : @entity207 ... about taxes ? another survey , by @entity208 and the @entity209 , showed two thirds of respondents support @entity8 's call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest @entity37			1
so what happens next ? senior @entity8 administration officials said monday the @entity2 's plan was a nonstarter , primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2 % income bracket and was too short on specifics			1
but even with no more offers officially in the works , both sides will keep talking , the officials said			0
that may happen as soon as monday night , when all members of @entity57 are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to , among others , the president himself			0
defense companies see cuts coming even with a budget deal @entity1 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
