i first came across @entity1 when i interviewed him in 2007			1
he was running his own school and had set up a peace council in @entity6 's restive @entity5 region			1
an eloquent @entity8 speaker , he was very keen to tell me his story on air			0
our first conversation was in whispers ; the @entity14 had started to make inroads in the @entity5 and were marching around the streets he told me			2
he was whispering as if he thought the @entity14 might hear at that moment			2
accolades , applause and a grim milestone our cameras could not go into @entity5 so we conducted our interview on the phone			0
we did not use his full name or photo to protect his identity -- although @entity1 insisted we do so			2
i asked him what an average day was like and he told me , " young lady , young boys are being slaughtered here before our very eyes like goats			0
" i was shocked by the savage image this simple statement had generated in my mind , yet this man had no fear of speaking to us			0
visionary i realized very quickly that this man was something different -- a visionary			0
@entity1 and i shared several telephone conversations between 2007 and 2009 during the @entity14 's reign of terror in the @entity5 and the subsequent military operation against them			1
children -- particularly girls -- were being stopped from going to school by the hardline @entity14 but he had kept his own school open			1
i asked @entity1 about his own children and whether he took them to school too			1
" yes of course , my boys are not too bothered but it 's my daughter that is giving me the most trouble , " he said			2
" she is insistent she continues going to school			2
" @entity6 's @entity56 : global symbol , but still just a kid " did you try and stop her ? " i asked			1
" no , " he replied			0
" it is her right to get an education , but in any case , i 'm not sure even if i tried if i could stop her ! " he giggled , in a very proud way			2
even in this darkest of hours he could find happiness in his pride			0
risking his life to talk to the media			0
serene years later , when @entity56 was shot and lay in intensive care guarded by soldiers at a military hospital , i called @entity1 to ask how she and the family were doing			1
he recalled our conversations and thanked me for calling			0
he had a remarkable air of serenity and simply said : " all we need is your prayers			0
pray for my daughter and for us			0
" @entity56 speaks with similar courage , compassion and presence			2
her message of peace and her calm philosophical approach to life reminds me of her father			0
@entity56 : " i want to become a prime minister of @entity6 " it is clearly the courage of his conviction that led @entity1 to talk to me about his hopes for peace and the battle with @entity102 militants for the right to be educated many years ago			1
he spoke passionately and philosophically about his vision			0
here was a man born , raised and working in a remote town in @entity6 , immersed in a culture where women wore burkas and rarely left their homes , never without a chaperone			1
yet he had the foresight , drive and principles to campaign for education for all and certainly had a huge hand in raising @entity56 to be the visionary she is today			1
we have not heard from and do not know much about @entity56 's mother			2
a traditional @entity123 woman , who wears traditional clothes and is a housewife			0
but it seems she wants and supports a very different lifestyle and future for her own daughter			0
oppression in a male - dominated society where the cultural oppression of women is rife , husbands , fathers , brothers -- men like @entity1 -- are real saviors			1
they help their wives , sisters , daughters become all they can be ; they encourage support and stand by them against all odds			0
the majority of women here in @entity6 that i meet know their rights , or know they are capable of much more and have huge ambitions			1
it 's the men in @entity6 who need to respect them and support them			1
the men who are with them and the men in authority			0
why @entity56 's bravery inspires us yes , @entity6 needs more girls like @entity56			1
i have met many who are , who defy the @entity14 by going to school every day in the @entity159 and tribal areas			1
i have met young children with little money for books and pens but who run up mountains in @entity167 and walk miles in the searing desert heat of @entity170 to go to school			0
there any many @entity172 in @entity6			2
but what @entity6 really needs right now is more men like @entity1			1
without men like @entity1 , there will be no women like @entity56 .			1

@entity1 , the father of @entity56 , has been a huge influence on his daughter
he backed her right to education in @entity6 despite the @entity14 threat
@entity56 was shot by the @entity14 after defying them with her insistence on going to school
@entity6 is a male - dominated society where women often lack the *opportunities* men have
