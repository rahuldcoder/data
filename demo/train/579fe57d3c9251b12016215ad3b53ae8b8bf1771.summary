@entity0 , the maker of the classic @entity2 taxi and a former niche player in @entity6 's once booming car - making arena , is now the last car company in the city and enjoys the curious status of being the biggest @entity2 - listed car maker by volume			1
maker of @entity2 's classic black cabs is linking with @entity15 carmaker @entity14			1
however , it is struggling with the recession			0
production is down to 12 vehicles a day during a four - day week in the @entity20 and is barely at break even			1
priced between £ 30,000 and £ 34,000 , they are not cheap			0
regulations such as the requirements of turning circles have helped protect the company 's dominant supply position in recent years -- but it has suffered a fall of up to 40 per cent in demand during the past year			2
in contrast to sluggish @entity20 production , the company is working flat out to export the @entity2 cab internationally			1
with the start of commercial production and sales of the taxis in @entity15 by a joint venture with carmaker @entity14 , it pins its hopes on the @entity2 taxi becoming an affordable option for cabbies worldwide			1
after an aborted attempt to set up a manufacturing and sales licensing deal with @entity49 in 2002 , @entity0 turned to @entity14 in 2006			2
the @entity15 automaker , which has become a 20 per cent shareholder in the company , has finally begun production of @entity2 taxis in a plant in @entity56			1
the joint venture , @entity58 , in which @entity0 holds a 48 per cent stake , hopes to sell 1,000 vehicles in @entity15 this year -- with expectations of a further 3,000 in territories beyond @entity63 such as @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 in the course of the next three years			1
@entity14 expects the average @entity15 black cab to sell for about £ 10,000 , with production costs as low as £ 4,000 on a production line capable of producing 40,000 vehicles a year			1
@entity73 , @entity0 's chief executive , does not claim demand will reach that level -- which is about 20 times the current sales rate in the @entity20 market			1
but he insists the taxis can find a premium niche among operators with millions of vehicles used as taxis and minicabs worldwide			0
mr @entity73 says : " if we were [ only ] a car company , making two or three thousand cars a year , we would have gone out of business years ago			0
in @entity2 , taxi drivers , " hearing tales of doom and gloom " as they carried @entity93 bankers and hedge fund managers in the autumn of 2007 became lead indicators of consumer belt - tightening			2
they deferred new vehicle purchases , which now hover at about 2,000 units a year rather than the 3,000 that can be produced to meet peak demand			0
@entity0 -- which was also affected by an embarrassing product recall last year after a series of fires in its vehicles -- has responded by cutting headcount , pay and shifts			2
it plans a £ 9.4m placing of shares in june to shore up its balance sheet -- as it has slipped into the red			0
if the @entity20 business is fragile , there is no doubting the robustness of the black cabs that have rolled off the production line at @entity0 's plant for several decades			1
@entity2 taxis typically cover between 20,000 and 30,000 miles a year -- with annual mileages of 100,000 clocked up by some cabbies in far - flung parts of @entity118			2
the average life span of a vehicle is 12 - 13 years with many taxis , often driven across shifts by different drivers , covering more than a million miles during their time on the road			2
the company has found innovative ways to save money , says mr @entity73			0
" two years ago , if you had stress - tested many companies for a 30 or 40 per cent fall in business , most would have predicted they could not survive , " he says , acknowledging the " but businessses have adjusted and found innovative ways to save money , he adds - efforts from both shopfloor and boardroom			0
in spite of the low @entity15 production costs and production capacity , mr @entity73 also insists he will maintain production for the domestic market in the @entity20			1
the joint venture should also see @entity20 production costs cut as a result of components supplied by @entity15			1
" we ca n't stand on our own two feet without @entity15 , " says mr @entity73 , whose business cards are in @entity148 and @entity15 characters			0
" we [ have ] always said the business is fragile			0
" but he adds : " there is significant value in being a @entity20 producer			0
" can you imagine @entity155 and @entity156 not producing in @entity157 ? we need a @entity20 manufacturing presence			0

@entity0 , @entity2 's struggling cab maker , in joint venture in @entity15
tie - up with @entity14 hopes to sell 4000 vehicles in *foriegn* markets
