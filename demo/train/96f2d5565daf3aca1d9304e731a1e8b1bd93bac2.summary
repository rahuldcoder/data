@entity0 -- long before computers or televisions existed , a man who would become a @entity4 senator and then president started an affair with his neighbor 's wife			1
even telephones were relatively new back then , so @entity12 wrote @entity13 smoldering love letters during their 15 - year relationship that ended prior to his inauguration in 1921			1
" i love you more than all the world , and have no hope of reward on @entity25 or hereafter , so precious as that in your dear arms , in your thrilling lips , in your matchless breasts , in your incomparable embrace , " said a 1910 letter first revealed in the book " the @entity19 " by @entity20			1
snail mail almost a century later , the snail mail between @entity12 and @entity34 becomes fully public later this month , revealing the most intimate secrets and thoughts of a man destined for the pinnacle of power as @entity4 endured the @entity40			1
in his book , @entity20 examines the possible historical impacts of the affair , noting that @entity34 may have spied for @entity44 and influenced @entity12 against running for president in 1916 as the war approached			1
" the @entity19 " " there 's that sex steamy side to these letters , " he told @entity1 in an interview monday			1
" but there 's also the big question of whether the @entity4 should get involved in the @entity40			2
they really debated that back and forth			0
she was really pro-german , he was very pro-american			0
" of equal interest , especially in the modern era of celebrity scandal mongering , is the pure salaciousness of the letters ' content			2
" they really are very graphic love letters , " said @entity20 , who came across them while researching his 2009 book			1
" and people think that 100 years ago nobody had sex fantasies and i keep telling people if those people did n't have sex fantasies , we would n't be here today			0
" keeping such a secret seems impossible in today 's digitally monitored world			2
not so back in 1905 , a decade before the first coast - to - coast long distance phone call			2
salacious details as outlined by @entity20 's book , @entity12 was married at the time and serving as @entity82 's lieutenant governor			1
he recommended that his friend and neighbor @entity34 , @entity13 's husband , go to a sanitarium that spring to help recover from the death of their 4 - year - old son a year earlier			1
meanwhile , @entity12 's wife @entity89 was recovering from a kidney disease			1
by august , @entity12 's affair with @entity13 commenced , though it only became physical three years later , according to @entity20 's book			1
" i do love you so , " he wrote in 1913 , two years before his election as @entity94 senator from @entity82			2
" i wonder if you realize how muchâ € ” how faithfully , how gladly , how reverently , how wistfully , how whole - heartedly and how passionately			2
yes , you do know the last , you must have felt the proof , but you ca n't know the others			0
" the same letter also showed @entity12 's concern about the affair being discovered , long before the internet age			1
" i have been thinking of all those letters you have , " wrote , adding that " i think you have a fire , chuck ' em ! do			2
if there is one impassioned one that appeals to you , keep it until you are tired of it , but chuck the rest			0
why it frightens me to think i ever dared mail them to your address			0
" by 1916 , circumstances had changed , according to another letter			0
from " enraptured bliss " to " depths of anxiety " " it is a little more than thirty - six hours since i saw you , and they have all been given to you , amid the perturbation i could not shake off , " @entity12 wrote after what @entity20 said was a secret visit to @entity34 in @entity122 , @entity82			1
" if you designed to punish me you have succeeded fully , " the letter continued			0
" i came with heart a hungering , i knew the flight to enraptured bliss , and was then suddenly plunged to the depths of anxiety			0
" the problem ? someone named @entity133 , described by @entity20 as a rival lover , came to @entity122			0
" i had feared for a year , but would not surrender , " @entity12 's letter continued			1
" i know now of my failure			0
i sought the impossible , and i am defeated			0
" @entity20 noted the influence of the pending war at that time			0
" he ultimately voted for war , " the author said of @entity12			2
" he knew that it would probably ruin their relationship , and kill him politically in a state that had a lot of @entity146			0
" the affair ended four years later , as @entity12 ran for president in an election he won easily over @entity151 @entity150			1
he did n't survive his first term , dying of illness in 1923			0
in a recent statement , the @entity154 announced it would make the more than 1,000 pages of love letters public on july 29 , with a discussion about them scheduled for july 22 in the @entity160 of the @entity161 in @entity0			1
