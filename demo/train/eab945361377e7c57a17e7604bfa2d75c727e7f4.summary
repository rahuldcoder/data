-- @entity1 can now call himself a " swarm chaser			1
" the storm - chasing tour guide and car dealership employee in @entity6 , @entity7 , is used to tornadoes and wicked weather			1
but on tuesday , he found himself rushing after chirping hordes of crickets in store parking lots near his home			1
" the crickets have been thick for a couple of days now , " he said wednesday			1
" it 's worst at night where there are large lights , but they seem to be everywhere			0
there are carcasses everywhere in the morning too			2
" he had stopped by local businesses to collect video of the cricket explosion in western @entity6 when the bright lights of parking lots were like a beacon in the night for the creatures			2
@entity1 , 32 , said he has lived in @entity7 all his life and never seen anything like this			1
he remembers seeing large numbers of crickets at a train station in @entity40 about 10 to 15 years ago , but that 's about it			2
" there are always a few crickets around in the summertime , but never a swarm like this , " he said			1
pictures of @entity7 's crickets have been all over social media this week , dotting @entity51 feeds and hopping around @entity52			1
@entity1 's own video became popular on @entity54			1
got crickets ? share your story on @entity54 he noted that numbers were dwindling a bit by friday			1
now , he said , he occasionally catches a whiff of their rotting carcasses , which are leaving a lingering , rotten smell in the brightly lit areas where the crickets were congregating -- like outside grocery stores			1
" you can definitely smell dead crickets if there 's enough of them in the parking lot , " he said , describing the stench as unpleasant , but not quite as intense as a rotting animal			1
@entity75 , an entomologist at @entity76 , said a similar swarm of crickets occurred last year			1
although the situation is reminiscent of a biblical plague , it 's hard to define the so - called invasion of crickets as a plague , per se			1
" i suppose if you have 10,000 dead crickets staring at you , they might seem like a plague , " he said			1
this year , @entity75 said , a weather pattern of prolonged dryness followed by rainfall in july and august may be to blame			1
similar patterns were observed in @entity40 and the southern @entity94			0
thus , the region provides good egg - laying conditions , shelter , safety and plenty of food			2
since they have short lifespans , the crickets tend to rush to reproduce when the conditions are right in the air -- and on the ground			2
" the wetter and looser the soil , the easier it is for them to lay those eggs , " he said			0
" boom , you just go into a huge mating frenzy			2
" while the crickets are not considered an agricultural pest , @entity75 said they are definitely a problem when they swarm , especially in commercial areas with bright security lights			1
" you have the nuisance call and the high numbers and the dead bodies , " he said			2
" they might dive bomb you at a football game			0
" to get rid of them , @entity75 recommends cleaning out trash dumps , checking window and door seals , and removing nighttime light sources at home , if possible			0
sprays or aerosols applied to hiding places are another possibility			0
the chirping bugs may have appeared a few weeks earlier this year than last , said @entity138 , @entity139			0
he knows because he has personally observed them			0
" we were shopping sunday and underneath the storefront , there would be hundreds of them , " he said			0
" people would have to go under them			0
" in 2012 , @entity138 noticed them arriving at the end of september , which coincided with the @entity149			0
" with all the lights around , people were having to dodge them , " he said			0
" that was a frenzy			0
" @entity138 said he is seeing an increase in calls from people wanting to know what to do about crickets			2
he suggests vacuuming loose crickets and varying the times that lights are on			0
stomping on the bugs may seem like a good idea , but @entity138 said that can backfire and cause the population to grow			0
" we want to kill them to keep them from moving , but when you kill them , the other ones are going to come in and eat the dead ones , " he said			0
@entity75 said crickets will eat just about anything , including plant material and each other			0
" sometimes when they 're younger , they do practice cannibalism , and when they get older , they do eat dead crickets , " he noted			1
when will they be gone ? @entity75 said to give it another week , but some @entity185 would say the sooner , the better .			0

huge swarms of crickets have been *springing* up in @entity7 , and on social media
storm chaser @entity1 became a swarm chaser after sending video to @entity54
late - summer rainfall after long periods of dry weather may be to blame
carcasses of dead crickets leave rotting smell for *passersby*
