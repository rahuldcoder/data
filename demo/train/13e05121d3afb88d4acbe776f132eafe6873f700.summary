-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's hot new names			1
for his feature film debut , " @entity10 , " he wrote the script and directed a cast that included @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9			1
his work on the film , about a @entity14 firm facing collapse after an employee ( @entity16 ) finds out its holdings are going to be worthless , has garnered him an @entity19 nomination for best original screenplay			1
his next film stars @entity21 as a man lost at sea			2
at 37 , he may seem like a wunderkind , but the former commercial director has been looking for his break for 15 years			2
he spoke to @entity0 about how the film came together , the challenges of building tension and his promising future			2
the following has been edited and condensed from the original transcript			2
@entity0 : " @entity10 " had a great cast			1
were there problems in attracting it ? @entity1 : attaching actors was actually not really the challenging thing with the film			1
getting actors to say yes is one thing , but having the money there and the crew there and have everything happen at the same time is where you run into quasi-impossibility			1
for a long time , we had the actors but no money			1
@entity0 : @entity8 plays the head of the firm and pressures it to dump its bad investments on others so it can save itself			1
he 's been characterized as the villain			2
@entity1 : the interesting thing is that @entity8 ' character is right , certainly following all norms of common understanding of business ethics			1
he has a piece of information before anybody else does , there 's a fair market value set for something , and he has a responsibility to his shareholders and his employees and his company to do something about that			0
the tension comes from ( the fact ) that the audience wants one of ( the employees ) to do something			0
hopefully , as the information travels up the chain of command , you see ( the characters ) in their own way regretting , or glossing over and moving on , or all the different emotions that happen when you see your own role in a tremendously damaging event			0
@entity0 : your background was making commercials			0
any we 'd recognize ? @entity1 : i never was a very prominent commercial director , to say the least			1
i did a lot of things for energy drinks and @entity102 , rally racing and @entity104			0
lots and lots of different industrials			0
if it was underpaid and under - budgeted , i was doing it			0
@entity0 : now that you 're an @entity19 nominee , are projects now falling into your lap ? @entity1 : yeah			1
amazingly , this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae			0
the reception to my script once we were in production was very strong			1
the biggest trick in the game , even at studio films , is to try and get actors attached to your piece			2
we had managed to attract this cast without any money , without a studio , without anything else			0
it 's been a slow , pleasant climb over the last two years since we shot the film			0
the film was very well received for what it was , which has allowed me to direct again , and everybody made their money back , so i 've been pretty blessed from that standpoint			0
so now we got ta go keep trying to get the opportunity to do this again .			0
