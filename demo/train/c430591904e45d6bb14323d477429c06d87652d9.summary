it sounds like a dangerous combination : massive tanks holding chemicals near a major water supply			1
that was the setup in @entity6 last week when a chemical spill contaminated a river supplying water to hundreds of thousands of people			1
officials say there was n't much regulation at the site where the spill occurred and that little is known about the chemical that leaked			1
now , state officials say they 're considering increasing oversight			1
" absolutely , " gov. @entity19 told @entity20			0
" we need to do what we can to see that this kind of incident never happens again			0
there 's no excuse for it			1
" two @entity29 congressmen say the spill exposes regulatory gaps in the country 's chemical control laws			1
and many in the area are asking key questions : what caused thousands of gallons of a chemical used to clean coal to spill into the water ? how dangerous is the chemical ? and why did n't anyone catch the problem sooner ? @entity46 status map state regulators inspected site in 1991 , 2010 , 2012 the facility where the leak occurred is owned by @entity51 , which supplies products for the coal - mining industry			1
the chemical that spilled , known as @entity55 , is used to treat coal to reduce the amount of ash			0
a state environmental inspector visited the site in 2010 after a complaint about an odor , said @entity63 , the head of the @entity6 @entity64			1
" we went out on site and did n't find anything that would cause concern , no leaks or anything like that , " @entity63 said			1
the licorice smell given off by the chemical that spilled , 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol , can emerge when it is transferred to or from the facility -- not just during a leak			2
inspectors visited the plant again in 2012 to determine whether any processes had changed that would require the company to obtain additional air quality permits , @entity63 said			1
the inspectors decided no new permits were needed , and they would n't have inspected the tanks where thursday 's leak occurred , he said			1
before that , the last inspection at the site had been in 1991			1
that inspection took place because the @entity93 plant stored different materials that required regulation , said @entity96 , spokesman for the environmental protection department			1
state environmental officials said the facility had the only permit it was required to have : an industrial storm water permit			1
" basically they had to monitor the runoff from the rain and send us the results every quarter			0
those were the only regulatory requirements , " @entity63 said			0
" the materials they were storing there is not a hazardous material			0
" that 's because the facility did n't process the chemicals , he said			2
the company was responsible for maintaining the tanks , @entity63 said			0
" there 's not necessarily the kind of robust environmental controls that people might anticipate that there should be on these types of facilities , " he said			2
that 's left @entity6 officials trying " to beef up what could be viewed as a loophole with these kinds of facilities			1
" @entity131 , the @entity29 attorney in @entity93 , said he 's investigating whether any laws were broken when the chemical leaked into the @entity134			2
but even if no regulations were violated , rules in the state could change as a result of the spill			2
" we are writing to request that you immediately schedule a hearing to examine the regulatory gaps that this incident has exposed in the nation 's toxic chemical control laws , " rep. @entity140 , @entity141 , and rep. @entity142 , @entity143 - @entity144 said in a letter monday			2
little known about chemical @entity155 health and safety officials say they do n't know much about @entity55			2
but they told about 300,000 people in nine counties to stop using the water once they discovered that 7,500 gallons of the chemical had leaked on thursday			2
on monday , they said people in some areas could start using the water again and assured them that it would be safe			2
this much is clear : somehow the chemical leaked out of the storage tank , breached a concrete wall surrounding the tank , seeped into the soil and reached the water supply			0
" my guy said you could see it bubbling up out of the ground , and there was no question what was going on , " @entity63 said			0
@entity51 president @entity177 said last week that residents ' safety had been his company 's first priority since he learned about the leak			0
" we have been working with local and federal regulatory , safety and environmental entities ... and are following all necessary steps to fix the issue , " he said			0
" our team has been working around the clock since the discovery to contain the leak to prevent further contamination			0
" an emergency official told @entity20 that when he saw the tank , it looked old			0
" i would say the tank was antique , " said @entity196 , deputy director of emergency services in @entity198			0
@entity200 , @entity6 's poison control director , told @entity20 last week that the chemical inside the tanks had not been studied			1
" we do n't know the safety info , how quickly it goes into air , its boiling point , " she said			0
that raises an important question , @entity140 and @entity142 said monday			0
" it is critically important that we understand how the law allowed a potentially harmful chemical to remain virtually untested for nearly forty years			0
... we should not have to wait for a major contamination event to learn the most basic information about a toxic chemical in commerce , " they said			0
a 2005 fact sheet about the chemical filed with @entity6 environmental officials offered guidance for what to do if a large spill is detected : " prevent runoff from entering drains , sewers , or streams			1

state inspectors visited the site in 2012 , 2010 and 1991 , officials say
the plant had the only permit required -- an industrial storm water permit
@entity6 's governor says he 's now considering increasing regulation
