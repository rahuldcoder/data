@entity3 lawyer @entity23 previously said her client would welcome a plea deal , but only if it did not involve jail time for the actress			1
" ms. @entity3 maintains her innocence , and now that i 've seen the police reports , i believe the case is entirely defensible , " @entity28 said after the initial hearing			2
" having said that , we will entertain a discussion concerning a plea if it means no jail so that she can move forward with her recovery and her career			0
" if @entity3 is convicted on the felony grand theft charge , her " ability at that time to have more input in the sentence could be lessened , " the judge told lohan wednesday			1
