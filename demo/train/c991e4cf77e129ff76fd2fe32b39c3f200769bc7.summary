-- @entity2 is changing its military rules of engagement and will now treat a military approach toward its borders by @entity6 as a potential threat that " will be dealt with accordingly , " @entity2 prime minister @entity1 said tuesday			1
the announcement is a significant escalation of rhetoric after @entity6 shot down a @entity2 plane last week			1
@entity1 criticized @entity6 harshly on tuesday for shooting down the @entity2 fighter jet , saying : " even if the plane was in their airspace for a few seconds , that is no excuse to attack			1
" " it was clear that this plane was not an aggressive plane			0
still it was shot down , " he said			0
war of words over downed jet he said @entity6 choppers have strayed into @entity2 airspace five times in 2012			1
but , the @entity2 say , the government never escalated the situation despite the border violations			2
that could change under the new policy			0
the shooting down of the @entity33 f - 4 jet on friday raised even more tension between @entity2 and @entity6 , two heavily armed regional powers			1
relations between the two neighbors have deteriorated during the uprising against @entity6 president @entity40 's regime			1
@entity1 has repeatedly called on @entity40 to step down			0
@entity2 has withdrawn its diplomats from @entity42			2
more than 30,000 @entity6 refugees have spilled onto @entity2 soil and @entity2 is hosting @entity6 opposition groups			1
@entity47 condemned the shoot - down " in the strongest terms , " secretary - general @entity46 said after the alliance met tuesday at @entity2 's request			1
both sides say the jet strayed into @entity6 airspace , but @entity2 says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected			1
@entity46 refused to comment on what intelligence @entity2 had presented to @entity47 about the incident at the alliance 's headquarters in @entity60 , @entity61			1
he called on @entity6 to " avoid such events in the future " and said he did not expect the situation to escalate			2
@entity47 did not promise any action in response to the incident , and @entity2 did not invoke the @entity47 article calling for collective defense of members , @entity46 said			1
the @entity47 consultations were held under @entity71 of the @entity47 's founding charter			0
the article allows any member to call for consultations " whenever , in the opinion of any of them , their territorial integrity , political independence or security is threatened , " the charter says			0
@entity83 's @entity82 called the shootdown an " attack " on tuesday and said it " constitutes a violation of international law			0
" it 's a reminder , the ministry said , that the regime " is threatening international peace and security			0
it is consistent with the regime 's escalating violence against its own population			0
" @entity98 , the @entity99 's official representative , expressed @entity101 's concern on tuesday			0
" in our opinion , it is important that the incident not be seen as a provocation or a deliberate action that could lead toward destabilizing the situation , " he said			0
@entity110 spokesman @entity109 said the @entity111 commends @entity2 for its measured response and stands with the government and the other @entity47 allies			1
@entity115 plans to work with @entity2 and others to hold the @entity40 regime accountable and to pursue a democratic transition in @entity6 , he said			1
@entity109 added that the regime 's continued use of airpower reflects @entity40 's desperate attempt to maintain control			0
security clearance : can @entity2 force @entity111 , @entity47 to attack @entity6 ? the @entity111 and many other countries have been vocally opposed to military intervention in @entity6 and are unlikely to encourage @entity2 to press the issue			1
after @entity6 troops shelled refugees on the @entity2 side of the border earlier this year , @entity111 secretary of defense @entity128 made clear that the bar is high for @entity2 to claim the need for a collective self - defense			1
@entity6 raised the stakes monday in the war of words over the incident			0
@entity6 @entity82 spokesman @entity140 said the plane was shot down in @entity6 airspace , disputing @entity2 's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into @entity6 airspace by mistake			1
" what happened was a violation of @entity6 airspace			0
even @entity2 says @entity6 sovereignty was violated			1
regardless of whether it was a training mission , a reconnaissance mission , it was a violation , " @entity140 said			0
he insisted that @entity6 was the wronged party , not @entity2			1
also monday , a spokesman for the @entity155 told @entity0 that @entity6 fired friday on a second @entity2 plane that was part of a search - and - rescue mission sent in after the jet was shot down			1
the plane , which entered @entity6 airspace in search of the jet , was not hit , said @entity163			2
" there was no injury , nobody was harmed			0
but that plane immediately returned to @entity2 airspace			2
and through military diplomatic channels we informed them : ' what 's going on ? ' " @entity163 said			0
the @entity155 said sunday that it considered the shooting to be a hostile act			0
@entity2 delivered the message in a diplomatic note to the @entity6 consulate in @entity178 , @entity163 told @entity0			2
in addition to @entity47 , @entity2 also submitted a letter about the incident to the @entity182			2
the country made no request for action , but outlined its version of events			0
" this attack at the international airspace , causing possible loss of two @entity2 pilots , is a hostile act by the @entity6 authorities against @entity2 's national security			1
thus , we strongly condemn it , " read the letter , dated sunday			0
it identified the downed plane as a @entity2 rf - 4 reconnaissance aircraft , a version of the @entity33 it was flying alone , without arms , in international airspace when it was shot down , the letter read			2
