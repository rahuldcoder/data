' " and then @entity0 did something that most people probably can not imagine			0
she started talking to him			1
" i thought i had better start talking to him before he starts attacking somebody else , " she told the @entity43			1
" i thought these people usually have a message , so i said , ' what do you want ? ' " indeed the men had a message			0
" the only reasons we killed this man ... is because @entity83 are dying daily , " he said in video aired by @entity79 affiliate @entity78			1
" this @entity6 soldier is an @entity86 , a tooth for tooth , " the man said in the video			1
" we swear by almighty @entity89 we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone			0
" @entity0 kept trying to engage the man			1
" i asked him if he did it and he said yes and i said why ? and he said because ( the victim ) has killed @entity83 people in @entity83 countries			1
he said he was a @entity6 soldier , and i said really , and he said , ' i killed him because he killed @entity83 and i am fed up with people killing @entity83 in @entity98			1
they have nothing to do there , " @entity0 said , according to the @entity43			0
as she recalled the ordeal to " @entity27 , " incredulous journalists asked her how she found the courage to continue to talk to a man holding a knife who had clearly just murdered someone steps away			1
" are you trained in any way to do this ? " a journalist asked her			0
no , @entity0 responded , laughing a little			0
" i used to be a teacher and ( that ) can be stressful at times			0
" " i know it 's big to die but , for me , it was just a regular guy ... just a bit upset , " she explained			0
" he was not on drugs , he was not drunk			0
" but she did get nervous			0
at some point , @entity0 took a moment to look around and realized that many people were snapping photos and taking videos			1
" there is so many people around , " she said on " @entity27			0
" " i mean ... i just look ( ed ) one , two second ( s ) around , ( and it was ) so daunting , so many people watching like this			0
" she worried that the man might react to the attention and try to hurt her or someone else			2
but , she said , " i said to myself , ' just carry on			0
' " so she kept engaging him			0
a " @entity27 " journalist asked : " were you scared for yourself ? " " no , " @entity0 replied			0
" why not ? " " better me than the child , " she answered , explaining that she realized there were mothers and children walking nearby			2
the scene was not far from a school			0
" it was more and more important that i talk to him , " she said			0
@entity0 kept asking the man , " what would you like ? " " i tried to make him talk about what he felt , " she told journalists			1
he told her that he was tired of bombs being dropped in @entity83 countries and @entity83 women and children being blindly killed			1
as this went on , @entity0 thought : when are the police coming ? but , still , she asked the man , " is there anything i can do for you ? " " he said , ' if the police come , i just shoot them			2
' " out of the corner of her eye , @entity0 said , she saw the bus start moving			2
it was going to leave without her and she had to go			0
she figured the police were going to get there any second			0
so @entity0 got on the bus and left			2
it took armed officers 14 minutes to arrive , according to @entity171			0
two suspected attackers were shot by police at the scene and are being treated in @entity2 hospitals			0
