-- once again , a cartoon of the @entity2 has sparked anger and controversy			2
a @entity6 newspaper published friday a cartoon depicting the prophet lamenting that his followers lack a sense of humor , drawing ire from the @entity13 community and fear of reprisal attacks just ahead of the @entity17 soccer tournament that is expected to draw thousands to @entity6 next month			1
the cartoon by the acclaimed @entity20 cartoonist @entity19 , who is known as @entity19 , shows @entity21 on a therapist 's couch and saying sadly : " other prophets ' followers have a sense of humour			1
" @entity19 called his cartoon " gentle , " and said he was responding to " @entity36 , " a @entity29 event that encouraged people to flout the belief by devout @entity13 that it is wrong to depict religious figures because doing so could lead to idol worship			1
@entity19 said he believes all faiths should be subjected to satire			2
no religious groups , he said , should be able to think they are above society and not respect freedoms afforded to people who live in democracies			2
he said there should have been more movement on this score since 2005 , when a @entity48 newspaper first published a series of @entity2 cartoons that led to riots around the world			0
" it 's important that we assert those rights , " @entity19 said			0
he said the irony is that the cartoon itself is about asking people to think twice before they get so angry			2
but despite @entity19 's intentions , the publication by the @entity61 on friday drew strong criticism in some @entity13 circles			1
" these are times that the enemies of @entity72 are intentionally causing events to provoke a reaction from the @entity13 , " said a statement from @entity6 's @entity66 , which went to court to try to stop the newspaper from printing the cartoon but lost its bid late thursday			1
the council said it was exploring legal routes to ultimately implement a ban on what it called " hate speech			0
" @entity72 discussed the topic on @entity6 airwaves friday			0
" muslims have been seriously offended by the publishing in the @entity61 newspaper of a blasphemous cartoon by @entity19 , " the station said			1
@entity61 editor @entity87 defended his decision to publish the cartoon			0
" i understand that for many @entity13 any representation of the prophet , no matter how innocuous , is offensive and i genuinely regret any offence that the cartoon may have caused those who hold this belief dear , " @entity87 said in an open letter published on the newspaper 's website friday			1
" that regret does not , however , outweigh my duty to the principle of freedom expression , " he said			0
creators of the " @entity104 say their idea stemmed from recent controversies surrounding the belief			0
at least two @entity109 cartoonists live under police protection after drawing @entity2 and , most recently , @entity111 censored part of the animated show " @entity114 " because it showed a depiction of the prophet .			0
