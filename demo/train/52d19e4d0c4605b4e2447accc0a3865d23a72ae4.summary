" after he scored his first goal for @entity8 in saturday 's 3 - 3 draw at @entity10 in the @entity11 , the former @entity4 international pointed his right arm straight down and touched that arm with his left hand			1
the gesture is known as a " quenelle , " but some have called it a @entity19 salute in reverse			2
@entity1 took to @entity22 and claimed the " gesture was just a special dedication to my comedian friend @entity25 " but the @entity4 government is seeking to ban @entity25 for alleged anti-semitic behavior			1
@entity4 sports minister @entity28 added on @entity22 that there was no place for @entity1 's gesture			1
" @entity1 's gesture is a shocking provocation , disgusting , " she said			1
" there 's no place for @entity35 on the football field			0

" it is dedicated to a @entity4 comedian he knows very , very well , " @entity37 said			1
" i think speculation can be stopped now			0
it is absolute rubbish really			0
" however , the @entity47 called for @entity49 authorities to punish @entity1			1
" this salute is merely a lesser known @entity19 salute and we expect the same kind of punishment to be handed down by the authorities as if @entity1 had made the infamous outstretched arm salute , " its president dr. @entity50 said in a statement on sunday			2
" this salute was created by a well - known extreme anti-semite who has displayed his hatred of @entity60 , mocked the @entity61 and @entity60 suffering			0
" it is sickening that such a well - known footballer would make such an abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators			0
there should be no room for such intolerance and racism in sports and we expect that the @entity11 officials as well as the police will give @entity1 the appropriate punishment			1
" the @entity11 has yet to comment on the incident , but @entity79 media reported that the @entity80 would investigate it			0
this is n't the first time @entity1 -- who has played for the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 in a 19 - year career -- has been involved in controversy			2
he earned the nickname of " @entity1 " due to his body language and was thrown out of the @entity92 by @entity4 after he allegedly insulted then coach @entity93 at halftime during a defeat against @entity96			1
@entity1 was later banned for 18 matches by the @entity98 , and in response he announced his international retirement			2
he had been part of @entity4 's @entity103 - winning squad in 2000			2
at @entity85 he allegedly once refused to train and was banned by the @entity105 club for 45 days			0
@entity1 is now playing for his sixth @entity49 club , having left @entity86 in january 2012 for a big - money move to @entity109 club @entity108			2
he lasted just a year there before going to @entity111 for a five - month loan with @entity84 , which won a second successive @entity114 title			0
the 34 - year - old had a difficult start to his time at @entity8 , which was marred by the death of his agent in august			0
the @entity10 game was his first appearance since late october , and he scored his first goals for the club in what was his eighth outing			0
@entity8 , which sacked manager @entity126 this month after a poor run of results , is 15th in the 20 - team @entity11 .			0
