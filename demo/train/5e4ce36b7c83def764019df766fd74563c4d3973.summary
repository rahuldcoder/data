@entity0 -- throngs of people crowded into @entity0 's @entity4 on friday in an effort to inject new life into @entity8 's revolution and push the country 's ruling military council to prosecute the former president , @entity11 , who stepped down under immense popular pressure on february 11			1
compared with previous weeks , the protesters ' ranks swelled , in part due to the addition of @entity8 's long - banned @entity18 movement , which had chosen not to participate in recent friday protests			1
there was another addition to the protest movement , one that marked a direct challenge to @entity8 's military rulers			1
fifteen @entity8 soldiers and mid-level army officers joined the demonstration , flouting a ban issued thursday by a military spokesman			1
several of the military personnel took to one of the stages erected in the crowded square and called for the @entity34 to be dissolved and replaced by a civilian presidential council			0
the @entity34 assumed legislative and executive authority over @entity8 after @entity11 resigned			1
the military personnel remained in the square into the evening			0
an army lieutenant colonel and a military police officer late friday tried to walk to the center of square , but they were surrounded by demonstrators who chanted " get out , get out			2
" within moments , members of the crowd began pushing the officers and knocking their hats off their heads			0
the officers , apparently frightened , started running and were pursued out of the square			2
earlier this week , several military officers took to the internet , recording video statements accusing the chairman of the ruling council , field marshal @entity53 , of protecting @entity11 from prosecution and of leading a counterrevolutionary movement			1
" if they really wanted to prosecute these corrupt officials they would have done it immediately			0
that 's why we are here today , " one of the protesting officers , told @entity1			2
on thursday , @entity34 spokesman maj. @entity62 told @entity1 that any military personnel who appeared in @entity4 in uniform would be immediately arrested and taken before a military tribunal			0
on friday , activists in @entity4 encircled the 15 protesting officers and soldiers as they walked through the crowd , protecting them from arrest or possible attacks			0
one of the officers spoke on stage to the crowd , acknowledging he risked arrest but urging demonstrators to repeat the tactics of january and february by staging an overnight sit - in in @entity4			2
@entity8 's interim government has investigated and arrested a growing number of officials from the former @entity11 regime in recent days			1
a former housing minister and @entity11 's long - time chief of staff , @entity83 , were both placed under arrest this week on corruption charges			1
" all of these ministers you see , its nothing ! " said @entity85 , a former parliament member and critic of @entity11			0
" the revolution wants the president himself ! wants his wife , his son , his daughter ! " @entity11 has been living on his estate at the @entity98 resort of @entity99 since he stepped down from office			2
the @entity8 military rode a wave of popularity after troops refused to fire on pro-democracy protesters during 18 days of street protests			0
but in the weeks since , the secretive 20 - man council has come under increasing criticism from different portions of the @entity8 political spectrum , amid complaints of human rights abuses and lack of transparency in its decision - making process			0
last week , more than 10,000 demonstrators peacefully protested in @entity4 , many of them heaping criticism on the ruling military council			0
but this week the numbers were boosted by @entity8 's long - banned @entity18 movement			1
" the @entity18 is joining the protest to support the demands of all the @entity8 who started this revolution , because we want to finish what we began , " dr. @entity121 , a senior official in the @entity18 , said thursday			1
" we want the army to speed up the trials of all those involved in corruption from the @entity11 regime			0
