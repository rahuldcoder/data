this @entity0 is going out just the way it began : in complete disarray			1
fourteen months after tea party conservatives ignored @entity5 leaders and forced a two - week government shutdown , another one came close to happening -- this time because liberals were blowing off president @entity10 's pleas to support a government funding measure			1
in the early morning hours friday , @entity10 signed a two - day extension , and the @entity13 is expected to pick up the legislation and vote on it later friday , though they have until midnight saturday before the next deadline			1
for weeks , legislative leaders insisted another shutdown would n't happen			2
but the @entity20 was just two hours away , and the @entity13 might not cast its final votes until this weekend			2
another flirtation with another deadline -- this one after a midterm election that swept @entity5 into control of the @entity13 -- offers a grim glimpse at the paralyzing levels of dissent that could come next			1
republicans do n't fear their leadership			0
and @entity31 do n't need their president			1
after november 's elections , when the @entity5 won the @entity13 and expanded its majority in the @entity20 , party leaders claimed a mandate			1
soon - to - be senate majority leader @entity37 has pledged that with @entity5 in control of both chambers come january , things will be different			0
more amendments will be allowed			0
" center - right " legislation will advance			0
but long - clear divisions on the right remain -- and were evident in the @entity20 when 16 republicans , many angry that the party had n't fought harder to block @entity10 's executive action on immigration , opposed the measure in a key procedural vote and nearly dealt their leaders a major blow			1
by the end of the night , 67 @entity5 voted against the measure 's final passage			2
conservative lawmakers complained that @entity20 @entity5 leadership punted their latest opportunity to combat @entity10 's signature health care law -- which they fought to defund during the october 2013 shutdown -- and his executive overhaul of immigration and deportation rules			1
" we 've seen the same pattern ... now @entity65 is funded			0
now @entity10 's executive amnesty is funded , " rep. @entity66 , @entity67 , said on @entity68			2
alongside him , rep. @entity70 , @entity71 , called the vote " disrespectful " to midterm voters			0
even if @entity5 gain stability , @entity31 are splintering			0
fresh off an election that purged the @entity31 of many of their most centrist members , liberals -- now more influential within their own ranks -- have gone rogue , saying " no " to what the @entity20 called a fair compromise , even though their bargaining position is n't going to get better			2
in an extraordinary scene thursday afternoon , two of the party 's most influential members made high - profile breaks with @entity10			1
@entity88 @entity87 called the government funding measure " blackmail " because of its inclusion of language rolling back a @entity93 reform that @entity31 had fought hard to win in 2010			0
meanwhile , the party 's liberal hero , @entity97 sen. @entity95 , declared on the @entity13 floor that it is " time for all of us to stand up and fight			2
" @entity10 and vice president @entity101 were calling @entity31 , urging them to support the measure			1
@entity20 chief of staff @entity103 rushed into a caucus meeting to make its case			0
but @entity31 insisted as they exited that meeting that @entity103 had n't won many members over			2
rep. @entity107 , @entity108 , said @entity31 need to draw a line now to signal that they wo n't accept these kinds of deals in the future -- when @entity5 will control the @entity13 , too , and are certain to advance bills with more conservative priorities			1
" if you do n't stand for something you 'll fall for anything , " rep. @entity115 , @entity116 , said in the meeting			0
still , some influential lawmakers said the government funding measure was a chance at redemption			0
@entity126 chairwoman @entity125 , @entity127 , said thursday night was an opportunity for @entity0 to break a pattern in which lawmakers have " paralyzed ourselves by making the perfect the enemy of the good			1
" " we tried to govern on a bipartisan basis , " she said			0
" we reached across the aisle and we reached across the @entity137 dome			0

president @entity10 signed the deadline extension early friday morning
@entity13 could vote on spending bill friday , but have until saturday before next deadline
@entity0 *narrowly* *averted* another shutdown thursday night , 14 months after the last one
what 's new is that now @entity31 do n't need their president
