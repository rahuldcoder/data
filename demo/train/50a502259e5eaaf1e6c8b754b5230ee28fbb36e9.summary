-- some @entity1 are giving homegrown food and specialty items as presents this holiday season and spending a fraction of what they 'd pay in a store			1
who does n't like a tasty bargain ? according to the @entity11 , about 41 million households participate in food gardening ; 58 percent do it to grow better tasting food and 54 percent do it to save money on food bills			0
but @entity16 , a home furnishings designer , is among the 23 percent of growers who share their tasty treats with others			1
this year , he 's giving away organic peach jam and preserves from his @entity22 ranch for the holidays			1
" it 's definitely a cost savings , " @entity16 said			1
" it probably ends up costing us about $ 2 a jar and we are handing out 60 this year			0
" but he does n't just do it for the cost , he enjoys the warm , fuzzy feeling it brings him			0
" they are the kind of fuzzy peaches i remember growing up with in @entity36 -- where you buy them off the side of the road and they make the whole car smell like summery goodness , " @entity16 said			1
" the jam is the same way -- the color of the peaches stays vibrant and when it hits warm bread it smells like i 'm back on the side of the road with peach juice dripping down my chin			1
" the 46 - year - old peach grower and his partner , @entity53 , planted about 30 trees on their ranch in @entity56 , @entity22 , three years ago and are just starting to get some fruit from them			1
so far , they make their jams and preserves from an older tree			1
" luckily , we have a mature peach tree that was planted by a forward - thinking former owner , which makes me more than a little nervous about what we 're going to do with fruit from 30 trees one day , " @entity16 said , chuckling			1
@entity16 said he makes his peach jam and preserves his grandmother 's way			1
" for canning , we parboil , peel and pit the peaches , then cook them down with some sugar and pectin and put them in jars in an enamel canner to sterilize , " he said			0
the jam has a velvety smooth sweetness without a hint of tartness			0
" we leave some big chunks of peaches in it , so you 'll get those real bursts of peach flavor and not too much sugar , " @entity16 said			1
his father is his no. 1 recipient			0
" he starts dropping hints around harvest time , " @entity16 said			2
the couple stopped giving store - bought holiday gifts a few years ago and enjoy giving " noncommercial " gifts			2
" at this point in our lives , no one needs more ' stuff , ' so we like giving consumables and creating something from scratch , with special meaning , " said @entity16			2
@entity108 of @entity109 , @entity36 , had a similar inspiration to grow holiday gifts from her garden			1
" i wanted to find ways to do something for our grown children without buying them gifts they may not really need , " @entity112 said			0
she also grows food for friends and business associates			0
she 's been making holiday gift baskets filled with homemade jams , jellies , pickles , relishes and breads for about 10 years			1
she also adds items like bay leaves , garlic and rosemary			0
@entity112 makes breakfast baskets , too			2
she grows her own field corn to grind for cornmeal and grits and will add fresh eggs from her chickens			0
she likes to add a bit of pizzazz to her gifts , so she 'll use cheese boxes , copper pots or iron skillets as containers for her food			2
" i think people always appreciate something that comes from the heart , " @entity112 said			0
" i can recall some experimental recipes that may not have tasted that good , like my whole - wheat fruit breads , but my gifts always bring a smile to my recipients			0
" @entity112 said she has always made homemade gifts to save money			2
" in these times , saving dollars means a great deal , " she said			0
" and the one benefit that can not be priced is the time one can spend with family , friends and community while gardening and harvesting			0
