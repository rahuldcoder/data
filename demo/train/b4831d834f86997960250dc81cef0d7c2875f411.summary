-- the smell of fall is already in the air in some parts of the @entity5			2
that means it 's time to pack up the car and drive to wherever the leaves are changing colors			1
or is it ? for some , hiking through the woods looking for leaves to slowly , slowly , slowly change colors and eventually fall off is about as interesting as watching paint dry			1
this so - called " kidnappee " is only observed on leaf - peeping trips " when dragged there by someone else , " according to @entity21 's introduction to @entity22			1
a leaf - loving spouse or parent or friend has often conned this hater of quiet nature into a leaf - focused trip			1
is there a way to honor the wishes of those travelers who appreciate the amazing beauty and science of trees hunkering down for the winter and those would rather do something else ? the leaf lovers could choose to travel solo			2
that 's a fine option			2
but may we suggest a compromise for those in mixed marriages and other foliage - fraught relationships ? give the nature lovers some designated time to enjoy the leaves , then try something a little less organic			1
or at the very least , pick a destination with a layer of history or adventure on top of the leafy beauty			1
a sip of @entity57 if your family is heading to @entity57 , you likely have some hard - core leaf enthusiasts among you			1
this fall foliage giant has a state website dedicated to the changing leaves			1
@entity64 to @entity65 for the view from the 800 - foot summit of @entity68 , made famous by @entity57 poet @entity69 , and enjoy the views of @entity71 , @entity72 and the surrounding hillsides covered in fall color			1
the hike to the top can take two hours , or you can drive			2
from the top , you might even be able to spot @entity78 at @entity79			0
the compromise : @entity64 to the nearby town of @entity82 to enjoy a pint at @entity84 on @entity85			1

@entity92 through @entity93 everywhere you go in @entity93 , there 's another stunning hike capturing the majesty of the changing season			2
@entity64 to @entity98 for a scenic drive			2
" driving around the lake , you get to explore the quintessential towns of @entity104 and @entity105 , " says @entity100 , @entity21 's fall foliage blogger			1
" @entity104 bills itself as the oldest summer resort in @entity5			0
on the @entity109 side , there 's @entity110 , a popular lakefront attraction , and @entity112			0
" it 's mostly a driving route , with places to get out and walk in towns and parks along the lake			0
the compromise : head down the road to @entity121 , where the resort 's zipline tours can get your adrenaline going			0
if you only have time for one activity , the zipline rolls peeping and adventure into one			0
@entity133 's @entity132 history @entity135 's beauty as the park 's leaves start to change color stands in dramatic contrast to the bloody history of what happened on the park grounds 150 years ago this year			1
visitors to the national park can enjoy guided or self - guided tours or horseback tours this fall			1
expect the most beautiful fall foliage in mid- to late - october			1
the compromise : the leaves are certainly not the main story at @entity135			1
learn more about the @entity152 and president @entity154 's historic @entity153			0
although many events were held in july during the 150th anniversary of the battle , there are still plenty of anniversary activities to experience			0
@entity162 's extraordinary artist the changing colors of @entity162 's landscape are brilliantly captured by many of the artists who have called the state home			1
@entity64 to the popular @entity169 in the @entity170 for peak aspen tree leaf - peeping season now through the end of october			1
the trailhead is located on @entity174 # 475 , about 13 miles from @entity175			2
the compromise : for another unique jolt of color and form , visit the @entity180 in @entity175			2
starting in october , the museum will host an exhibit showcasing @entity184 's depictions of @entity185 ( @entity186 ) , where she had a rural retreat			1
the exhibit runs through january 26 , 2014			0
or tour @entity184 's home and studio in nearby @entity192			1
( spots are limited so make sure to make reservations in advance			0
) @entity197 's small - town culture at an elevation of 6,684 feet , the @entity199 summit in @entity197 is a spectacular vantage point to view the changing leaves of the @entity203			2
the highest point east of the @entity205 , @entity206 is at an altitude of more than a mile			0
the compromise : drive into the town of @entity211 for respite from the quiet of the leaves			0
@entity211 is filled with art galleries , performances , festivals for almost every interest , and nearby farms			0
consider a zipline tour at @entity221 for a more adventurous trek			0
@entity224 's hunting and food scene there 's nothing like @entity228 for seeing nature at its wildest , and the trees on the @entity232 are heading into full fall foliage splendor in late september			1
@entity64 there quickly before winter descends upon the park			0
the compromise : after a stint in the forest , you might be inspired to hunt for your meal			0
for the sports enthusiast , there 's fly fishing and hunting based out of the nearby town of @entity246			0
foodies will appreciate @entity246 's @entity248 ( september 19 - 28 ) and the nearby town of @entity250 celebrates @entity252 beer and food at its annual @entity254 ( september 26 through october 5 )			2
an artist 's view of @entity257 @entity257 's rugged fall foliage is unlike anything you 'll see in the northeast and it 's happening right now			1
drive up to @entity262 in @entity257 's @entity263 , near @entity264			2
there you 'll see " spectacular displays of lime , yellow , orange , red and crimson - quaking aspen reflected in tourmaline blue lakes and surrounded by saw tooth granite peaks , " writes @entity274 , who blogs about @entity257 's fall foliage			1
the compromise : after all that peeping , visitors can head to the town of @entity280 to see how celebrated photographers @entity282 and @entity283 see the landscape at @entity285			0
@entity287 's ice cream what leaf - peeping enthusiast could leave out @entity287 ? it has an official " @entity290 " in @entity291 , commissioner of the state forests , parks and recreation department			1
start in @entity294 and head east toward @entity295 and @entity296 , where you 'll see good early fall color driving through the @entity299 ( @entity300 or @entity301 )			0
after spending the first half - hour in farm country and the foothills of the @entity305 , head north to @entity295 on @entity307			0
" this week 's forecast looks great , and the onset of cool nights and some frost is what really kicks in the next level of vibrancy , " @entity291 says			0
if that good weather continues next week , " that drive within an hour 's radius of @entity318 's will afford viewing opportunities of every stage of fall color			1
" the compromise : that 's right			0
stop by the plant in @entity295 for a tour and some ice cream			0
you 'll get to sample the ice cream flavor of the day and buy more at the factory @entity331			0
and where did you favorite flavors get buried after being eliminated ? the factory 's flavor graveyard ( which is only open through october )			0
because it 's @entity287 , and we think you should soldier on a bit longer ( you non-leaf fans ) , we add @entity291 's extended tour : from @entity318 's , take the classic foliage tour on @entity307 north up to @entity296 , where the color is already more advanced			1
@entity346 108 through @entity347 , another fall favorite , to quickly spot more advanced color			0
