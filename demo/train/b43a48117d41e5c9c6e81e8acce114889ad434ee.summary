-- composer @entity1 was an anti-semite whose music was used , after his death , as @entity5 propaganda			1
he was also , as some say , " one of the most gifted , historically important composers to ever grace the planet			0
" so fans of his music , including those in @entity13 , are willing to overlook his hideous views and embrace his art. this is what is generally considered separating the art from the artist			1
as writer @entity21 put it , " hideous people can make great art. " since @entity23 canceled syndication of " @entity25 " recently in reaction to multiple allegations that @entity28 is a rapist , i 've been thinking more about whether we can separate the art from the artist			1
for a certain generation , " @entity25 " had a huge impact			0
i was 7 years old when " @entity25 " premiered , and over the course of eight seasons , i grew up with @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and , yes , @entity42 , the father character played by @entity28			1
given the history and context of race in @entity47 , it was amazing for middle - class white kids growing up in @entity49 to see a middle - class black family that in many ways resembled their own			0
for black kids ( let alone adults ) growing up in @entity47 , it must have been transformative to see on tv a happy , successful , normal black family such as the @entity57			0
black people had been poorly depicted on television for as long as the medium existed , and in mostly negative light			1
so when @entity63 called the @entity57 " the most atypical black family in television history , " it implicitly contrasted them not only with fictional black tv characters , but also with the " welfare queens " and " crack addicts " whom conservative politicians criticized			0
in such a context , that the @entity57 were normal was actually radical			0
" it is hard to believe that @entity28 is a serial rapist because the belief does n't just indict @entity28 , it indicts us , " wrote @entity72 in the @entity73			1
" it damns us for drawing intimate conclusions about people based on pudding - pop commercials and popular tv shows			1
" @entity83 may have been just a tv character , but he was also a symbol , and @entity28 appeared to embody his positive virtues			1
i think some of our collective reluctance to believe more than a dozen women who have accused @entity28 of rape stems from our desire to preserve the cultural significance of " @entity25			1
" we drew feel - good conclusions about @entity28 the man from pudding - pop commercials and tv shows not just because he wanted us to , but because we wanted to			1
it 's " difficult to believe something so sinister about a public figure as beloved as @entity28			1
he gave us @entity102 , @entity25 and @entity103 , " wrote @entity99 in @entity100			0
" we ask ourselves , how could a talented comedian -- a family man , a philanthropist -- also be a serial rapist ? " in a way , " @entity25 " is like a surrealist work of art attacking our illusions of normalcy			1
the picture - perfect dad in the show may turn out to be a real - life serial rapist			2
illusions are easy to believe , but reality is harsh			0
yet the art often survives -- along with , by association , the artist			2
earlier this year , @entity119 's daughter @entity121 resurfaced allegations that @entity119 had molested her when she was a child			1
there 's also the controversy surrounding @entity119 's affair with his ex-wife @entity127 's adopted daughter @entity126 , whom he later married			2
all of this has seemingly done little to tarnish @entity119 's career			2
he continued to enjoy commercial and artistic success with his films			2
he even received the @entity133 lifetime achievement award at the @entity134 in 2014			0
there 's also the filmmaker @entity136			2
in 1977 , when he was 43 years old , he was arrested for sexually assaulting a 13 - year - old girl during a photo shoot			0
@entity136 was indicted on six criminal charges and pleaded guilty , but fled @entity47 before sentencing			0
since then , from exile , he has produced and directed several award - winning films			0
and a petition from @entity146 dignitaries calling for @entity136 to be pardoned includes @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity119			0
in 2009 , singer @entity150 pleaded guilty to felony assault after beating up his then - girlfriend @entity152			0
his third studio album , " graffiti , " released later that year took a hit			0
but a few years late , his album " @entity157 " did great			0
the fans liked his music despite his previous bad behavior			2
of course , @entity28 has n't been convicted of anything			1
but given that over a dozen women have come forward with claims of a similar pattern of sexual assault , the allegations should be taken very seriously			2
will @entity28 's artistic legacy and reputation survive ? we wo n't know until the dust has settled			1
but " @entity25 " seems undoubtedly tarnished			0
it 's hard to watch it now , knowing what we 've heard about @entity28 , and not feel slimy and somehow complicit in his alleged crimes			1
but at the same time , turning off the show seems too easy -- it 's not unlike the way we turn away from our discomfort with rape and rape victims			1
maybe it 's better if we squirm with the ugly picture for a while .			0

@entity186 : it 's hard to reconcile @entity28 the man with @entity28 the talent
@entity186 : amid allegations of rape , can we still enjoy the @entity28 show ?
for example , @entity1 was an anti-semite yet people still enjoy his music
@entity186 : sometimes it 's better to separate the man from the art
