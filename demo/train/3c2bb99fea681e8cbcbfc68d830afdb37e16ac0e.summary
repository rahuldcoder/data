-- @entity4 's @entity3 has penned a letter to @entity6 saying it is determined " to create an atmosphere of reconciliation and unity , " the isolated nation 's state news agency reported			1
but @entity6 says it wants to see action not words from @entity4 leader @entity12 's regime			1
in the letter , the @entity4 's defense commission vowed to work to " completely halt hostile military acts , realize the reunion of separated families and relatives , ... and re-energize multi-faceted north - south cooperation and exchanges			1
" there was , however , a catch			0
the @entity4 officials ' peace proposals come with a request to halt upcoming @entity27 - @entity6 military drills and a reiteration of @entity30 's claim to its own " precious nuclear force for self - defense			1
" a call last week by @entity4 about the annual joint military exercises next month was swiftly dismissed by @entity35 and @entity36			1
the open missive this week was carried by @entity38 , which for years has featured reports deriding @entity6 and its longtime ally , the @entity27			1
it touts the proposal by @entity4 authorities last week that signals " the steadfast will of its army and people to improve the @entity49 relations by concerted efforts of the two sides , not asking about all inglorious happenings in the past			1
" " @entity57 relations will be improved on a solid basis only when both sides take realistic measures to prevent impending nuclear disasters with concerted efforts of the @entity4 nation , " the commission wrote in a letter reportedly written thursday and put out the next day			2
but @entity65 spokesman @entity64 - do said later friday that if the @entity4 is sincere about improving ties , it " must show action " that @entity6 citizens and the international community can accept			1
that notably includes @entity4 showing how it will take steps to dismantle its controversial nuclear program and making efforts to resolve humanitarian issues , like the reunions of families separated by the @entity77			2
hard to read many in @entity35 and elsewhere have long been wary of @entity30 's motives and intentions			0
@entity6 president @entity81 told @entity0 's @entity82 earlier this month that she feels it is now especially hard to make sense of what 's happening or will happen next inside @entity4			2
she referenced the recent unforeseen execution of @entity12 's uncle and perceived protector , @entity89 , as proof			0
" @entity4 has always been very unpredictable , but the level of unpredictability has , in fact , ( been ) exacerbated , " @entity81 said			0
" i 'm concerned about deepening volatility			0
" @entity4 's latest letter touches on many of the same points , and highlights similar proposals , to a statement addressed to @entity6 authorities last week			1
the two statements are among the more conciliatory and less combative communications from @entity30 in recent years			0
in his @entity104 's address earlier this month , @entity12 called for better relations with the @entity49			2
tensions last year the relationship between @entity35 and @entity30 became particularly strained last year as @entity4 hurled dramatic threats against @entity6 and the @entity27			1
@entity30 has continued to develop its nuclear and long - range missile programs despite widespread international opposition			0
early last year , tensions simmered near the boiling point : @entity4 's army declared the armistice ending the 1950 to 1953 armed conflict to be invalid on march 11 , and a few weeks later , state news reported that @entity30 had entered a " state of war " and threatened to " dissolve " the @entity27 mainland			2
" any issues regarding @entity123 will be treated in accordance to the state of war , " @entity4 's government said in a special statement carried by @entity38			2
the tensions have since eased somewhat and @entity30 and @entity35 have resumed dialogue on a certain number of issues , including their joint industrial zone that sits on the @entity4 's side of the border			2
dispute over drills in last week 's statement , a @entity135 conveyed @entity12 's " sincere stand to ease tension and ensure peace " while also slamming " ill - boding , provocative remarks ... from @entity6 " as well as " powder - reeking war exercises " involving the @entity27			1
" the recent announcement of the huge @entity4 - targeted war drills by the @entity27 and puppet warmongers is a total denial of the improvement of the @entity49 ties and dialogue and is little short of the declaration of a total nuclear stand - off , " said the spokesman			1
@entity4 has in previous years called for the cancellation of the annual joint military exercises between @entity6 and the @entity27 , but without success			1
the drills appeared to be a key cause of @entity30 's threatening rhetoric last year			0
the @entity27 reiterated thursday that it wo n't call off the drills with @entity6 , which start next month			1
" we do n't plan to stop the exercises , " adm. @entity160 , head of the @entity161 , told reporters			0
" the exercises are ... a cornerstone of how we train and maintain the alliance ... it 's not a change			0
we do these every year			0
" notably , @entity4 's latest message jabbed directly -- as it has in the past -- at @entity6 's international allies			2
and the commission did n't entirely spare @entity35 either , chiding leaders there for not embracing its " important " initiative			0
" regretfully , ... the @entity6 authorities still remain unchanged in its improper attitude and negative stand towards the proposal , " the letter states			0
" what is most important for mending the @entity183 ties is to have a proper attitude and stance towards this issue			0
" journalist @entity81 contributed to this report .			0
