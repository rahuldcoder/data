a key national security adviser to president @entity1 said he believes the @entity2 will " absolutely " secure an international coalition to defeat the rapidly growing terrorist group operating in @entity5 and @entity6 known as @entity7			1
" i absolutely do believe that there will be a coalition of countries from the international community , from here in @entity12 , also from the region where many of the neighbors have stepped up and said they want to be a part of that type of effort , " deputy national security adviser @entity8 said in an interview thursday with @entity10 outside the @entity12 summit in @entity13			1
" a lot of these @entity26 countries are concerned about the foreign fighters that have gone down to @entity5 and @entity6 who have @entity26 passports			2
so they are very concerned that this threat in @entity5 and @entity6 could end up posing a threat here in @entity26 , " @entity8 said			0
how @entity7 flaunts its brutality as propaganda the president has yet to make a decision to conduct airstrikes in @entity6 , @entity38 officials cautioned			1
it is also unclear how an @entity44 coalition would take shape			0
@entity8 suggested participating countries would likely serve in different roles , depending on their capabilities and appetite for a more direct military involvement in the mission			0
lots of ways for nations to step up to the plate and be a part of this coalition , " @entity8 said			0
@entity12 leaders tackle packed agenda including @entity7 , @entity62 , @entity63 in a sense , there is already a coalition assisting the @entity2 in its current limited mission against @entity7 in @entity5			2
@entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 forces have participated in airdrops of humanitarian supplies to @entity5 and @entity74 under assault from @entity7 militants			1
@entity1 created some confusion about his strategy at a news conference in @entity80 earlier this week when he said his goal was to both " degrade and destroy " isis and reduce the group 's threat " to the point where it is a manageable problem			0
" why is @entity7 so brutal ? @entity8 argued there was no inconsistency in the president 's remarks , insisting the mission to defeat @entity7 is a multi-step process			1
" what the president was saying is this is a phased effort and the first phase is going to have to be pushing back @entity96 , getting them out of those strongholds , putting in place the coalition that can then work methodically to destroy the organization , " @entity8 said			0
on a conference call with reporters thursday , @entity8 indicated any decision to conduct airstrikes would occur after secretary of state @entity105 , defense secretary @entity106 and a @entity38 counterterrorism adviser travel to the @entity108 to gauge support in the region for an @entity112 coalition			1
inside the mind of an @entity7 fighter but @entity8 told @entity10 it would be difficult to ultimately destroy @entity7 without dealing with the organization in @entity6 , where it currently enjoys a safe haven			2
" you have to deal with the challenges on both sides of the ( @entity5 - @entity6 ) border , " @entity8 said .			0
