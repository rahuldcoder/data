-- when @entity2 walks into a room , people step aside			2
at 7 feet tall and 285 pounds , @entity2 is the starting center for the @entity6 champion @entity7			1
he hurls his @entity9 - like shoulders against some of the biggest and baddest men on the planet every game night			1
@entity2 recently came across a book that was as ruthless as anyone he 's encountered in the @entity6			1
" at first , i was shocked , " he says			2
" i thought it was cutthroat			2
" @entity2 started reading " @entity18			1
" the best - selling book offers a collection of 48 laws that show people how to gain power , preserve it , and defend themselves against those powerful people who make their lives miserable			1
unlike most self - help books , " the @entity18 " offers advice that the author freely admits is , at times , cunning and amoral			1
it includes lessons like " @entity32 : never outshine the master " and " @entity34 : pose as a friend , work as a spy			0
" the lessons are distilled from colorful anecdotes lifted from 4,000 years of history			0
they include insights into the scheming of powerful people such as @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
the book has proved to be so popular that it has spawned several sequels , one recently co-authored by the popular rapper @entity51 , called " the 50th law			1
" meet the man behind the laws of power @entity56 , author of " the 48 laws , " says our fascination with power is rooted in our dna			1
" we want to believe we 're descended from angels when we 're descended from primates , " @entity56 says			0
" this is part of our nature and there 's nothing to be ashamed of			1
" @entity56 says the struggle for power affects even the most benign human relationships			1
think of how babies threaten , badger and scheme to get their way , he says			0
" children can be incredibly manipulative , " @entity56 says			0
@entity56 , whose laid - back , soft - spoken demeanor seems at odds with his books , has long been fascinated with power			1
at first , his interest was restricted to sports			0
then he earned a degree in classical studies and saw how power shaped history			1
@entity56 says he received his next lesson in power when he began working as a writer in @entity89			1
every transaction -- business or personal -- revolved around someone grasping for more power , he says			1
@entity56 realized that @entity89 's power elite did n't act all that differently from the ancient @entity95 and @entity97 emperors he encountered in his classical studies			1
he decided to share his insights in a book			1
" i wanted to show that what was going on was not new , " @entity56 says			0
" no one wanted to talk about how these incredible manipulative games had been going on for thousands of years			0
" one of @entity56 's central claims is that everyone must learn the rules of power			1
he describes the world as a " giant scheming court , " and says we 're all courtiers , whether we like it or not			0
" there is no use in trying to opt out of the game , " he writes in the introduction to the book			1
" ... instead of struggling against the inevitable , instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty , it is far better to excel at power			1
" practicing the laws of power that 's the lesson that @entity2 , the @entity7 ' center , says he 's learned			1
@entity2 likes @entity123 : " do not build fortresses to protect yourself -- isolation is dangerous			0
" it tells the story of @entity129 , the first emperor of @entity97			0
the emperor was so paranoid about his enemies that he slept in a different room each night and never let any of his subjects see him			0
the result : he lost power because he lost touch			1
@entity56 's lesson : isolation exposes you more than it protects you			2
circulate among people , build allies and learn to spot your enemies			0
" that was cool , " says @entity2 , who says he has to be leery of people who try to take advantage of his celebrity			0
" it 's good to be out there , to visit and to see your enemies and even be in the same room with them			2
" @entity153 made @entity56 's book required reading for a business management class he taught at @entity156			1
his students loved it , he says , because it was more practical than most business or self - help books			0
@entity153 's favorite law : law 10 : " avoid the unhappy and unlucky			2
" that law says that one should avoid people who always attract misfortune			0
they can " infect " others with their pathology			0
the law 's solution for dealing with a master of misfortune : do n't help or argue with an " infector " or you will become " enmeshed " in their problems			2
do n't return the call			0
@entity153 says he once became involved with some " infector " relationships that resulted in his living out of his car for five months while becoming deeply depressed			0
when he cut those people out of his life , he says , his life took off			0
he is now the ceo of a company that secures government contracts for small businesses			0
" if someone is always unlucky and things are always happening to them , deep down inside , there 's something that 's attracting it , " @entity153 says			2
" you do n't want to be around them			0
" @entity198 , founder and ceo of @entity199 , is also a fan of @entity56 's laws of power			1
he calls them laws of nature			0
" every single human interaction involves this power exchange , " he says			2
" but it does n't mean that power ca n't be generous or philanthropic			2
" the book , though , has its critics			2
@entity211 is a @entity212 professor and management guru			0
people like lists , he says , but 48 laws are too much			0
" if you give people a list of 48 things , they 're certainly not going to remember them in a situation when they need to use them , " says @entity211 , author of the forthcoming book " power : why some people have it and others do n't			1
" @entity211 says @entity56 's laws are flawed because they are based on isolated historical examples			2
why not build laws around solid research , like a study or experiments ? " if you go to a doctor and the doctor says you have a disease , and we know the treatment because we tried it on one person and it worked -- would n't you love to have the treatment based on a long - term study ? " @entity211 asks			0
criticism does n't seem to rattle @entity56			0
he says he had some tough times in his early career when he violated the first law of power in his book ( " never outshine the master " )			1
but learning the laws of power has given him tranquility			2
" it just brings a sense of calmness and detachment because things do n't bother me , " he says			0
" i observe everyone else 's power games			1
it 's a beautiful position to be in			2

book 's ruthless guide to power has won fans
" @entity18 " fans include @entity268 , rappers and an @entity6 star
the rapper , @entity51 , liked the book so much that he *co-wrote* a sequel
book 's author : " there is no use in trying to opt out " of the game of power
