-- sailor @entity1 hopes that 2012 will be the year that he and his team will break the world speed sailing record -- and he believes he has the right contraption to do it			1
the @entity5 2 is half boat , half plane , and hopefully it will soon to be the fastest sailing vessel on water too			1
" everything above the water is an aeroplane and everything below the water behaves just like a boat , " says @entity1 , a professional sailor who 's now turned his attention to breaking the speed sailing record , describing it as his lifetime mission			1
to attempt the feat , @entity1 and his small team of naval architects , engineers and yachtsmen and women , created the sailrocket -- a hybrid boat / plane			1
" a large part of this boat is flying , it 's supported by aerodynamics , " says @entity1			2
" when it 's going at high speed , it 's like a well - built paper airplane			2
" the record is open to any craft , as long as it 's using wind and water , and there is at least one person on board			1
currently it is held by @entity43 kite surfer @entity42 , who reached 55.65 knots ( 103 kilometres per hour ) over the required 500 meter course in 2010			1
the group held the record briefly three years ago , but they 've come across some strong competition for the title , with wind surfers proving to be the toughest opponents			1
last month the team made another record attempt in southern @entity53			1
@entity54 in @entity55 provides the ideal wind conditions for the sailrocket			0
the group spent days trying to reach 60 knots -- the speed they believe will not only get them the record , but also keep it with them			1
" the boat is based on this whole new idea , " explains @entity1			2
" it 's got no overturning forces			0
" he says the wind and water forces are in alignment			2
" it 's like someone trying to push you over by pushing at the soles of your feet			0
" the craft may be using the latest technology , but its concept is based on a craft that was written about nearly five decades ago			0
@entity43 rocket scientist @entity82 wrote about a sailboat in 1963 that he believed could reach 40 knots -- a concept that was well ahead of his time			1
@entity1 's team tracked down @entity82 in 2007 to tell the then 97 - year - old that they had broken the 40 knots , using the ideas @entity82 came up with 44 years earlier			1
building on that design , they have since been able to go 50 knots and are pushing to go even faster			2
in @entity55 last month they were unable to go any faster than 51 knots , but @entity1 is certain they 're not far off the mark			2
he thinks it 's a matter of redesigning the boat 's foils			0
" one of these days we 'll get the foil right and i think we 'll smash the record			0
" the professional sailor is determined that there is no vessel like it in the world			1
it 's because of this @entity1 is reluctant to talk openly about the specifics of the sailrocket 's design as they continue their endeavor to break the record			1
he 's now back in @entity117 working on new foils that will hopefully provide them with the edge they need to get the record			0
they aim to return to @entity55 , perhaps as early as april , to try again			0
but the attempts are not without risks			0
@entity1 likens the sailrocket 's 500 meter course to an aircraft going down the runway , but with too much weight in its nose so it ca n't take off			0
" it is dangerous , " he concedes			0
" you go out there and you do n't realize the consequences if the smallest thing goes wrong			0
" he says the worst crashes are the ones when the boat dives directly into the water			2
" that 's a killer			0
at least in the air you slow down			0
" but despite the dangers , @entity1 and his team wo n't stop until they hit the 60 knot mark and take with it the world speed sailing record .			1
