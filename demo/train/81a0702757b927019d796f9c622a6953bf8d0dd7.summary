-- a judge on tuesday refused to throw out a case filed by four cast members from the hit 1970s television show " @entity10 , " who are suing to recover money from merchandise they claimed they have never received			1
@entity12 judge @entity11 denied a motion by @entity14 for a summary judgment , which would have ended the lawsuit			1
the key issue remaining in the case is whether the actors may be entitled to payments from the sale of " @entity10 " dvds			1
@entity11 ruled that that " defendants have not met their initial burden of showing that plaintiffs are not entitled to merchandising royalties for the use of their likeness on dvd sets sold to consumers			0
" " the court emphasizes that it is not making a determination on the merits of ( @entity14 ' ) claim , which might be proven at trial , but only that defendants have not met their initial burden " for the purpose of ending the lawsuit , @entity11 wrote			1
the ruling means the case , unless it is settled , would go to trial on july 17			1
four members of the cast , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , along with the widow of @entity52 , sued @entity14 in april 2011 , claiming they have not been been paid what they 're owed for the worldwide sale of " @entity10 " merchandise			1
the series was on the air from 1974 to 1984			0
under their contracts , the actors were supposed to receive 5 % of net proceeds , or 2.5 % if their images were used in a group , the lawsuit states			1
" it 's a certain sense of vindication that they ruled in our favor , " @entity48 told @entity0 in a phone interview			0
" we feel obviously very pleased and happy with that ruling			0
it 's just confirmation of what we 've been claiming all along			0
" asked if the cast would actually go to trial if necessary , @entity48 said , " we did n't come this far to then all of a sudden stop			2
it was a big victory for us today , so we 're prepared to go all the way			0
" in interviews with @entity0 last year , the actors claimed they were cut out of the merchandising bonanza from the show			0
those products include comic books , t - shirts , scrapbooks , trading cards , games , lunch boxes , dolls , toy cars , magnets , greeting cards and dvds where their images appear on the box covers			0
the actors claim they never received revenue statements related to merchandising , and that @entity14 intentionally never intended to pay them anyway			2
a fraud claim had previously been dismissed by the court			0
in asking the court to dismiss the case , @entity14 said it had paid the actors everything they were owed for merchandise and that sale of the dvds are covered under the @entity112 agreement			1
it said that agreement allows @entity14 to " reuse photography from ' @entity10 ' to exploit the television series without making additional payments to the plaintiffs , " @entity14 attorney @entity113 wrote in papers filed with the court			1
" it is undisputed that plaintiffs have received all of the residual payments for dvds to which they are entitled			0
" while the actors claimed they had not been paid for all merchandise related to the show , the proceeds from the @entity124 is the only remaining major issue in the case			1
revenue from " @entity10 " slot machines featuring images of the actors was not as high as originally believed , plaintiffs attorney @entity131 said			2
it was the actors ' discovery of those slot machines several years ago that led to the lawsuit			0
" the undisputed evidence shows , however , that @entity14 reported all revenue it received in connection with merchandise bearing the plaintiffs ' name or likeness in the merchandising royalty statements provided to them and that there is no revenue that has not been reported to plaintiffs , " @entity113 wrote			2
in court papers , @entity131 wrote that , in fact , all merchandising revenues have not been accurately accounted for and that , over the years , the actors did not receive financial statements related to the sale of " @entity10 " items			2
since the case was filed , @entity131 said @entity14 has sent the actors checks totaling about $ 10,000 each for owed merchandising payments			1
the checks are being held by @entity131 's law firm pending the outcome of the case			0
last year , in other papers filed with the court , @entity14 claimed the actors " are attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action " for fraud and breach of good faith			2
the company said this was " all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages " in the case			0
@entity14 said the case was " a garden - variety breach of contract action , nothing more			1
" the actors accused @entity14 of " despicable conduct , " saying " although defendants routinely rebrand their corporate images , they should not be permitted to rebrand the truth			2

a judge tuesday denied a motion by @entity14 that would have ended the lawsuit
four ' @entity10 ' cast members are suing for money from merchandise
the lawsuit states the actors should have gotten between 2.5 - 5 % of net proceeds
