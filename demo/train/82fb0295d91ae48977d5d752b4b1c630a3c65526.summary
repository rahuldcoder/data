-- one summer day back in 2008 , fisherman @entity1 went to see @entity2 , a @entity3 photographer living in @entity4 , the beautiful island off the @entity7 coast			1
struggling to make a living , @entity1 asked @entity2 if she had a job for him			0
@entity2 did n't , but asked him instead whether he could help her find any " tanga , " the old sails from the traditional dhows that she loved			1
a couple of days later , the local fisherman returned with a magnificent brownish old sail , weathered by years of salt and storms from navigating the @entity20 waters			0
" it had a big hole in the center created by the wind and the old age of the material , " remembers @entity2 , who at the time had just come out of a relationship			1
" i just laughed and said to him , ' if i do a big red heart around it , this will look just like my broken heart at the moment			0
' " so @entity1 left again to return this time with tins of red and black paint he used for his dhow			1
together , they started painting a big red heart around the hole ; once done , @entity2 dipped the brush into the black paint and added the words " @entity44			2
" read this : fishing craft to foosball tables , furniture to float your boat " we looked at it and we just loved it so much , " says @entity2			2
" i said i think we should frame it and put in the shop of a friend of mine			0
" less than two hours later , an @entity59 couple walked into the art store and stood in front of the broken heart holding hands			0
" they said ' that is beautiful , how much is it ? ' " recalls @entity2			0
" i had no idea and i just kind of said a ( very expensive ) price but they said ' well , we want it " -- it started exactly like this			0
" @entity73 what started was @entity73 , a business launched by @entity1 and @entity2 producing anything from whimsical paintings and high - end handbags to beautiful bed covers and cushions			1
six years after their first sale , they have sold several broken hearts -- as well as other designs -- to customers from all over the world			0
everything is handmade , created from old fishing material and whatever washes up on the shores of @entity73			1
" we are making more and more , " says @entity2			0
" we are actually in the process of thinking wider and bigger			0
" read this : artist 's spectacular glasses ' give trash a second chance ' @entity73 , which is also the name some locals use for @entity1 , has 34 permanent staff and sometimes employs as many as 70 people			1
the business has a couple of workshops on the island but most of the craftsmanship is done in the artisans ' homes			1
these are people who are usually @entity1 's family members , friends and other local fishermen			2
" @entity1 's family is happy because of this business because they all have a job from this company			2
" says @entity118 , a friend and artisan			0
" we are the friends so we are close now like brothers , " he adds			0
" so we also depend on this company			0
" " @entity123 " the artisans also paint thoughtful and uplifting messages on many of their designs , promoting love , peace and care for the environment -- slogans like " @entity133 , " " the only way to save @entity135 is with my heart " and " @entity138			1
" " i just close my eyes and see what the day brings , " says @entity2 , describing where she draws inspiration for the messages adorning @entity73 's one - of - a - kind creations			1
" depending on the mood of the day , " she continues , " what is going on around the world and the people around me -- the fishermen , the people i 'm working with are my big inspiration , so it 's from them i find all these sayings			2
" the company sells its designs from a small boutique on @entity73 , mostly to tourists			1
but one of the main challenges for the business has been a drop in the number of people visiting the stunning island recently			2
@entity73 , which is listed as a @entity165 by @entity166 , is very close to @entity167 and has previously been targeted in terror attacks			1
watch this : @entity73 deals with the tourism blues " we do survive because of exports , otherwise we would n't make it , " says @entity2			1
in hopes of attracting a bigger clientele , they 've put themselves online so that people from all over the world can see their works and make custom orders			2
" in 10 years i hope @entity73 can be all over the world , " says @entity1			1
" so my company has a really good life			0
