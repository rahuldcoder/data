one of the many disturbing aspects of the @entity2 spying revelations is how much joy they have brought to the world 's chronic violators of human rights and political freedoms			1
on thursday in @entity11 , where former @entity2 contractor @entity12 awaits his asylum papers , a @entity10 court removed a major critic of @entity10 president @entity16 from the @entity18 's list of worries , sentencing the charismatic opposition leader @entity20 to five years in jail on theft charges			1
amid intense anger at the verdict and fears that it would raise @entity20 's profile , the court agreed on friday to release him pending appeal			2
the trial and the predictable verdict , as the @entity35 foreign affairs chief said , " raises serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in @entity10			0
" that 's putting it mildly			0
@entity38 is the most prominent , but just one in a long series of politically - motivated prosecutions in a country where the courts seldom make a move that displeases @entity16			1
@entity20 was particularly worrisome to the @entity10 president			1
he had gained an enormous following by speaking out against corruption and cronyism , labeling @entity16 's @entity48 " a party of swindlers and thieves " and using social media to help mobilize the president 's critics			2
he had just announced he would run for mayor of @entity11			0
but , like other @entity16 opponents with any possible chance to loosen the president 's complete hold on power , he will likely go to prison instead			2
now that he 's released , @entity20 is considering whether to stay or withdraw from the race for mayor			2
meanwhile , @entity16 and his backers are having a field day			0
they claim it is @entity68 that leads the world in violating human rights , even as dozens of people who dared protest against @entity16 's rule face trial or languish in jail , in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances			1
when @entity84 , once the wealthiest man in @entity10 , decided to turn his attention from business to politics , the tax authorities turned on him			0
he was sent to prison in @entity89 , and when he became eligible for parole , the state filed another case , winning another conviction which extended his sentence			0
then there 's the case of @entity97			0
the government auditor was sent to investigate the investment firm @entity99 , which was charged with tax evasion			0
when @entity97 concluded the tax fraud was actually coming from the government side and became a whistleblower , naming a network of corrupt officials , he was accused of working for @entity99 and thrown in jail , where he became ill , was denied medical treatment and died in 2009 , when he was just 37			0
the @entity108 responded with the @entity109 , imposing sanctions on those involved in his death			0
@entity114 did n't save @entity97 from @entity10 's courts , which found him guilty of tax fraud just last week			2
many others , including the performance group @entity118 , have seen even small scale political activism land them in jail			0
for @entity16 , having @entity12 in @entity10 creates many complications , but he has hardly managed to conceal his glee at having @entity108 's top critic under his protection			1
he has made it clear that he wants @entity12 to refrain from harming @entity108 - @entity10 relations , and as a former @entity128 spy himself , the @entity10 president would risk ridicule if he ventured too far in criticizing @entity2 actions			1
still , @entity16 derived visible satisfaction from having @entity12 land in @entity10 's lap , armed with material to discredit the @entity108			1
conflicted by the need to preserve a needed relationship with @entity68 while wanting to maximize the benefit of @entity12 's presence , @entity16 did his best impression of a protector of human rights			1
@entity12 and @entity143 ' @entity142 , @entity16 said , consider themselves " human rights activist ... fighting for the spread information			1
" " ask yourself , " he said , affecting the pose of a defender of oppressed activists , " should you hand these people over so they will be put in prison ? " the implied answer was of course not			0
how could @entity16 possibly help send a human rights activist to prison ? ! the @entity18 's media apparatus , in what is undoubtedly an effort to give @entity108 a black eye and take away @entity68 's power to criticize @entity10 's abuses , launched a campaign to put @entity12 on a pedestal with programs that tore apart the @entity108 , while glorifying the former @entity2 contractor who drew the curtain on @entity108 government surveillance			1
after that carefully crafted media operation , @entity108 's voice in the @entity20 case lost its edge			1
after the verdict , the @entity108 ambassador wrote a tweet decrying the " apparent political motivations in this trial			0
" but @entity10 democrats and human rights activists have a weaker supporter in @entity108 now			1
@entity12 's days in @entity183 brought a similar reaction from @entity185			2
that was particularly ironic , considering that no country on @entity188 has a more elaborate machine to monitor and manipulate what its citizens do online than does @entity185 , where the @entity193 also has complete control of the political system			0
@entity196 , the government mouthpiece , gloated " this is not the first time that @entity108 government agencies ' wrongdoing have aroused widespread public concern			0
" this , from a state that , in the words of @entity212 , " imposes sharp curbs on freedom of expression , association ... openly rejects judicial independence and press freedom ; arbitrarily restricts and suppresses human rights defenders ... " even if you agree with @entity12 that the @entity2 spying is going too far , as i do , it 's hard to argue with the negative impact @entity12 's revelations have had on human rights activists in other countries			1
today , dictators and authoritarian rulers are basking in a viscous moral relativism , feeling their abuses are somehow justified by criticism of @entity108 's spying			1
there are , however , many meaningful differences between @entity108 's surveillance excesses and those of @entity10 , @entity185 and their ilk			1
the most important of all is that @entity10 and @entity185 's behavior is motivated by a desire to suppress internal dissent , to protect the people and the organizations in power			2
nobody believes that is @entity68 's motivation			0
the @entity108 may have gone too far , or far adrift , in pursuit of national security , but its spying machine is not built to destroy domestic opposition to the government			0
when people say , " the @entity108 are just as bad , " they are not only clearly wrong , they are also hurting the cause of political and personal freedom around the globe			0
@entity12 's revelations are a legitimate subject for discussion and criticism			2
but advocates of internet privacy , free expression and human rights should not allow abusive authoritarian regimes to use @entity108 actions as a cover for their egregious misdeeds .			1
