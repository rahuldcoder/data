-- roughly 20 % of the antibiotic prescriptions written in the @entity2 for adults each year are for sinus infections			1
that 's an impressive statistic , given that doctors and public health officials have long doubted that antibiotics can successfully treat the condition			1
a new study , published this week in the @entity11 , appears to confirm those doubts : the antibiotic amoxicillin was no better than placebo at improving the congestion , cough , runny nose , pain , and other symptoms that accompany sinus infections ( also known as acute sinusitis ) , researchers found			1
" compared to placebo , amoxicillin does n't seem to provide any benefits , " says lead author @entity23 , an associate professor at the @entity24 , in @entity25			1
" in terms of patient satisfaction , side effects , symptom relief , days missed from work , et cetera , we did not see any difference			2
" @entity0 : is it a cold ? or a sinus infection ? most sinus infections are caused by viruses , which do n't respond to antibiotics			1
but even bacterial sinus infections rarely require antibiotic treatment , according to the @entity45			1
in most cases , both types of infection go away on their own in less than two weeks			0
" most patients get better despite antibiotics , not because of them , " says @entity23			0
" there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution			0
" antibiotics would be more useful if doctors were able to distinguish between viral and bacterial sinusitis			1
but general practitioners have no tests at their disposal that reliably diagnose bacterial infections , @entity23 says , and in the study she and her colleagues were unable to identify any symptoms or other markers that predicted which patients would respond to antibiotics			1
" the problem for primary care physicians is figuring out which patients would benefit , " she says			0
@entity0 : how to tell if you need an antibiotic the study included 166 people with moderate or severe sinus infections			1
half of the participants took amoxicillin three times a day for 10 days , and the other half took a placebo on the same schedule			2
in addition , every patient was given acetaminophen , cough medicine , and decongestants to use as needed			0
the two groups of patients improved at approximately the same rate			0
by day three , just over one - third of those in each group reported a lessening of their symptoms , a proprotion that increased to roughly 80 % in each group by day 10			0
the patients taking antibiotics did feel measurably better than the placebo group on day seven , but the researchers did not consider the difference to be clinically ( as opposed to statistically ) significant			2
on that day , the difference in the two groups ' quality of life -- as measured by a scale appropriately named @entity108 - 16 -- was negligible , the study notes			0
@entity0 : 10 products that can ease sinus symptoms the results reinforce what many doctors have suspected , even if they 've continued to prescribe antibiotics to sinusitis patients , says @entity117 , @entity118 , an assistant professor of family medicine at @entity120 , in @entity121 " we do n't practice it , but we do know it , " he says			1
" this study might help us give out fewer antibiotics			0
" the main reason doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics is that patients have come to expect them , @entity23 and her colleagues note			2
one way of satisfying patients without overusing antibiotics , @entity23 says , is to give them a prescription but advise them not to fill it unless their symptoms persist or worsen -- a protocol that 's become popular in @entity141			2
@entity23 says it 's also vital that doctors talk to their patients about which treatments work , which do n't , and why			1
" you have to have some communication plan , " she says			0
" you need to provide information about what they should expect and what to do if their condition deteriorates			0
" @entity0 : surprising causes of sinus trouble patient expectations are n't the only driver of antibiotic use for sinus infections , however			1
@entity161 , @entity118 , director of the @entity162 and @entity163 at @entity164 -- @entity165 , in @entity166 , @entity167 , says some doctors prescribe the drugs to guard against the very rare chance that a sinus infection will progress to something much worse , such as a brain abscess , a bundle of cells that can develop following a bacterial infection			1
" the chances are quite small , but the outcome if it does happen can be catastrophic , " @entity161 says			0
" and behind every bad outcome is a medical malpractice attorney			0
" some doctors will be reluctant to withhold or discourage antibiotics until physician organizations formally adopt the conservative approach advocated by @entity23 and her colleagues as the new standard of care , he says			2
the overuse of antibiotics for sinusitis has important public - health implications in light of the growing concerns about antibiotic - resistant bacteria and viruses			2
widespread antibiotic use can lead the infectious organisms that cause disease to adapt a defense , making the drug less effective in the population overall			0

doctors still prescribing antibiotics for sinus infections , despite evidence they do n't work
antibiotic amoxicillin was no better than placebo at improving symptoms
even bacterial sinus infections rarely require antibiotic treatment , the @entity45 says
