one day after executing dozens of non-muslims at a quarry in @entity4 , the @entity1 militant group @entity0 waged an attack in its home base of @entity7 -- killing at least four people , according to police , in an attack on a @entity12 convoy			1
three of those killed in wednesday morning 's attack near @entity19 's airport were civilians and another was a security force member , @entity14 col. @entity13 said			1
" i saw at least two dead bodies lying in a pool of blood on the ground , and police arrived soon at the area and began shooting in the air to disperse the crowds , " a witness named @entity22 said by phone from the scene			0
a plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the airport , which also acts as a staging ground for @entity12 operations and for the @entity39 troops on a peacekeeping mission in @entity7			1
two @entity12 vehicles were damaged , a @entity12 official said , but no @entity12 staff members were killed or injured			1
@entity0 claimed responsibility for what spokesman @entity45 called " a sacred bomb attack " targeting " foreign mercenaries and @entity12 staff			1
" @entity45 said this action had claimed the lives of " several @entity7 soldiers and foreigners working with @entity12 , " but he did not specify a number of dead or their nationalities			1
such violence -- in @entity7 and carried out by @entity0 -- is hardly unprecedented			2
the group has been active in @entity58 for years , waging an armed campaign that initially aimed to turn @entity7 into a fundamentalist @entity61 state , according to the @entity62			0
yet @entity0 , which the @entity63 designated as a foreign terrorist organization in march 2008 , has n't confined its targets to @entity7 authorities			1
its militants have also killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and @entity39 peacekeepers			0
@entity7 and allied @entity39 forces have pushed back , even forcing @entity0 from its last major stronghold in @entity74 in early october , according to residents and military commanders			2
yet they have n't stopped the group entirely , as evidenced by a deadly car bombing outside a popular @entity19 restaurant one week after that milestone			0
and it 's not as though @entity0 is confining itself to @entity7			2
the terrorist group -- whose then - leader , @entity84 , pledged allegiance to @entity87 in 2012 -- has been active elsewhere in @entity58 as well			0
its bombers attacked bars and restaurants in the @entity92 capital of @entity93 on the night of the 2010 @entity95 final , killing more than 60 people			0
and last fall , @entity0 militants casually walked into the upscale @entity98 in @entity99 , @entity4 , and began gunning down shoppers -- allegedly torturing some hostages before killing them			2
the four - day - long siege ended with as many as 67 dead and parts of the mall destroyed			0
last month , authorities said at least 28 died after @entity0 ambushed a bus in @entity4 and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite @entity111 verses			0
and on tuesday , the group 's militants raided a quarry in the @entity4 village of @entity117 , near the @entity7 border , separating @entity120 workers from their @entity122 counterparts and executing them , group spokesman @entity112 said in a statement read on a @entity125 - @entity0 radio station in @entity7			1
at least 36 bodies were found dumped in the quarry , according to the @entity4 @entity127 .			0

police : 3 of those killed were civilians ; 1 was a security force member
two @entity12 vehicles were damaged , but no @entity12 personnel were injured
@entity0 claims responsibility for the attack , a spokesman for the group says
" foreign mercenaries " were the terrorists ' target , he adds
