in " @entity2 , " @entity0 famously responds to a @entity5 senator 's demands by saying , " my offer is this : nothing			0
" since president @entity11 announced his normalization deal with the @entity9 regime in december , life appears to be imitating art. last week , @entity9 president @entity8 declared that his regime would not even entertain the @entity11 administration 's requests to normalize ties until the @entity5 abandons our naval base at @entity21 , ends the trade embargo , ceases pro-democracy radio and television broadcasts into @entity9 and compensates the regime for " human and economic damages " the @entity5 has , according to him , inflicted on the @entity9 people			1
last month , the regime 's lead negotiator summed up its position even more succinctly after the first round of @entity5 - @entity9 normalization talks in @entity33 , saying , " change in @entity9 is not negotiable			2
" in other words , emboldened by the first wave of concessions @entity11 gave the @entity8 regime in the form of access to more @entity5 dollars , it wants even more in exchange for nothing			1
when dealing with tyrants , you ca n't wear them down with kindness			1
when that approach is attempted and one - sided concessions are made , tyrants do n't interpret them as good faith gestures			1
they interpret them as weakness			0
this is a lesson the @entity11 administration has failed to learn from its dealings with @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 , and even terrorists such as the @entity61			0
on tuesday , the @entity5 people will have their first opportunity to hear from the @entity11 administration about its dealings with the @entity8 regime when i chair a hearing of the @entity68 's @entity70 affairs			1
i look forward to hearing the perspectives of @entity73 officials , even though i am already concerned by the administration 's reluctance to allow the @entity5 people to hear directly from the two @entity77 officials who negotiated the deal with the @entity8 regime over the course of 18 months of secret negotiations , and without the input of our government 's top diplomats and negotiators			1
many important questions remain about what exactly the @entity8 regime has done in exchange for @entity11 's softening of travel and banking regulations that will now allow more @entity5 dollars to fill the @entity8 regime 's coffers			1
for example , it 's unclear why , with all the economic leverage it initially brought to the table , the administration apparently accepted a deal to free conditionally 53 political prisoners -- many of whom were released , but with charges pending or were threatened with more jail time if they renew their pro-democracy work			0
indeed , some have already reportedly been rearrested in addition to hundreds of new detentions since the december announcement			0
questions also remain about what , if anything , the administration has done to secure the repatriation of what the @entity114 estimates to be more than 70 fugitives from justice being provided safe harbor in @entity9 , including known cop killers such as @entity120			0
also unknown is what , if anything , the administration intends to do to secure billions of dollars ' worth of outstanding @entity5 property claims and judgments against the @entity9 government			0
the list of questions and concerns like these goes on and on			0
in recent months , i 've made clear that i believe the president and his allies in @entity133 are misguided for supporting a policy that gives away practically all the leverage the @entity5 has to bring about democratic change in @entity9 in exchange for virtually nothing			2
while reasonable people can disagree on the merits of what @entity5 - @entity9 policy should be in the 21st century , no serious person can argue that @entity5 is stronger when we give a cruel regime such as the one in @entity9 everything it wants from the @entity5 , including money it uses to repress its opponents , while we get nothing in return except more anti-american bluster from a geriatric dictator			2
with @entity9 in the news recently , many @entity5 are asking why @entity9 matters to them and why they should care			0
the simple answer is that what happens with @entity9 has far - reaching and potentially damaging implications far beyond the island nation			0
@entity9 is not the only rogue regime with which @entity11 is engaging in an attempt to end bad behavior			2
when @entity5 sits at the negotiating table with one tyrant or radical regime , the others -- from @entity57 to @entity58 and elsewhere -- watch closely and learn best practices that they can apply to advance their own anti-american agendas			2
just as the @entity9 regime reportedly cited our swap of five members of the @entity61 in the negotiations for @entity173 ' release , the @entity57 watched how @entity58 exploited @entity5 diplomacy , slow - walked negotiations and ultimately achieved their goal of developing a nuclear weapon			0
there should therefore be no doubt that regimes around the world will be looking to emulate the @entity8 regime 's so far successful efforts to take advantage of @entity11 's weaknesses and to undermine the @entity5 role as the world 's leading economic and military power			1
when the president settles for one - sided deals with the @entity8 regime , it hurts the @entity9 people and their aspirations for freedom			1
when @entity11 allows the @entity8 regime to get the best of him in negotiations , it emboldens tyrants around the world			1
as the president 's engagement with the @entity8 regime continues , i will do all i can to ensure that his " normalization " does not come at all costs , becoming yet another instance of a failed foreign policy that makes @entity5 weaker in the world and , ultimately , less safe			1
