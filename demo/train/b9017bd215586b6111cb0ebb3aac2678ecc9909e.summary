-- meet @entity1 : supermodel			0
danger to web users everywhere			0
that 's according to an annual list from web security company @entity7 , which ranks the year 's " @entity8 " online			2
the list is based on the likelihood that spammers , scammers or other ne'er - do - well residents of the @entity14 will use each celebrity 's name to lure unsuspecting clickers to sites that host viruses and other malicious software			1
" while slightly safer than last year , searching for top celebrities continues to generate risky results , " said @entity21 , director of web security research at @entity7			1
" consumers should be particularly aware of malicious content hiding in ' tiny ' places like shortened urls that can spread virally in social networking sites or through e-mails and text messages from friends			0
" @entity1 , a former @entity34 model who produces and hosts " @entity36 , " replaces last year 's no. 1 celebrity , @entity37			1
according to @entity7 , searching for @entity1 's name yields a nearly 1 - in - 10 chance of hitting a link that leads to a malicious site			1
@entity37 slipped to second while , in what can only be called a surprise performance , @entity0 's own @entity45 ( also a judge on " @entity46 " ) snagged the no. 3 spot			1
in addition to spurring questions about how he landed amongst a bevy of models and actresses , @entity45 is the only man to make the top 10 list other than @entity55 , who barely made it in a three - way tie for 10th with @entity58 and @entity59			2
rounding out the top 10 were actresses @entity61 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 and @entity69 's @entity68 model ( we 're seeing a trend here ) @entity73			0
according to @entity7 , sports stars and singers are a safer search than actors and models			2
tennis stars @entity79 and @entity80 , who came in at @entity81 and 14 last year , respectively , dropped to 44th and 56th on this year 's list			0
@entity83 tallied only a 49th - place finish ( tweens rejoice ! ) , and @entity86 came in at no. 58 .			0

model , reality host @entity1 top 's @entity7 's list of @entity92 's most dangerous celebrities
list notes which celebrities ' names are most likely to yield links to malicious sites
@entity1 replaced @entity37 at top of list , while @entity0 's @entity45 finished no. 3
@entity7 says *athletes* and singers are safer searches than other celebrities
