if there was a musician who transcended the difficult boundaries between @entity4 and @entity5 , it was sitar maestro @entity6			1
@entity8 , as he was known to his fans , did it by remaining true to his craft			0
" he was an amazingly pure artist , " says @entity11 , one of @entity6 's pupils and a sitar master in his own right			1
though he 's often thought of in the @entity5 as an experimenter and collaborator -- with guitarist @entity17 , violinist @entity18 , saxophonist @entity19 , composer @entity20 and conductor @entity21 -- @entity6 was a traditionalist			1
indian classical music , as ancient as the scriptures of @entity24 , flowed from his fingers with ease			1
his music transfixed even those who knew not one iota about the complexities of it			1
" that is the beauty of his approach to music and how he was able to transfer that and translate that to an audience in the @entity5 , " @entity11 says			1
@entity6 's music moved from introspective to playful			1
" there 's a whole gamut of emotions that finds a place with people , " @entity11 says			2
@entity6 died tuesday in @entity45 , his home for many years			1
he was 92 and led a life rich with accomplishments and accolades			0
i was one of those people who was transfixed the first time i listened to @entity6			1
i was still in high school in @entity53 , @entity54 , when @entity6 and his troupe came to town for a performance at @entity59 's music school in december , 1978			1
there were only a handful of @entity63 families in @entity53 then , and not much was available to us in the way of homeland culture			1
it was a rare treat for us to be able to see @entity6 in concert			1
my mother was especially excited			0
she was trained in voice and sang the songs of another talented @entity63 , @entity72 , @entity63 's sole @entity74 laureate in literature			1
she played harmonium with her songs and sometimes , a tanpura , a string instrument that resembles a sitar but has no frets			0
it was a moment of pride , as well -- in a time when @entity63 was known to many of my @entity87 friends as a land of human misery			1
when we wanted to boast of the greatness of our land , we uttered @entity6 's name			1
a few days before the concert , organizers called my mother with a special request : could she possibly cook dinner for the musicians ? @entity6 was craving a home - cooked @entity101 meal			1
of course , yes , my mother said			0
who would not be honored to cook for the maestro ? then came days of cooking -- spiced rice pilau with raisins and pistachios , chicken curry , lentils and sandesh , a special milk sweet for which @entity112 are famous			0
on the night of the performance , @entity113 was packed			0
the lights dimmed and @entity6 's music filled the air , mellifluous and luscious like the rich silk of a @entity120 sari			1
opinion : @entity6 , emissary for world beat i did n't understand the melodic forms and rhythms of the music that was played that night			1
i knew that he had written the music for director @entity129 's acclaimed " @entity128			2
" but i was not unlike millions of others who connected @entity6 's name to the @entity133 and to the concert for @entity135			2
i had expected to react in typical teenage fashion with boredom			0
instead , i was transported to another sphere			0
@entity6 's sitar was magical			2
the rhythms of the performance fell and rose with the improvisation of each melody framework known as a raga			0
his sitar told of joy and sorrow , of lives led and dreams dashed			0
the intensity on stage rose as @entity6 challenged tabla virtuoso @entity152 to match each one of his sitar riffs			2
i did not just hear a performance that night			0
later that evening @entity6 and @entity152 arrived at our house			2
i sat in awe through every course of my mother 's dinner			0
it was my introduction to the classical music of my homeland			1
i realized then that i did n't need to understand the nuances of the notes			0
@entity6 spoke to me in a language that was universal			2
" he created an aura of spirituality , " says journalist and musician @entity170			0
" his music transcends the boundaries of race and religion			2
it is what humanity is all about			0
" @entity17 dubbed @entity6 the " godfather of world music			1
" many @entity63 like to think of him as their cultural ambassador to the world			2
had he been born a westerner , he might have been a household name like @entity186 or @entity187 , @entity170 believes			0
in later years , @entity6 said he was happy to have contributed to bringing the music of @entity63 to the @entity5 , though he regretted his name forever linked to a 1960s culture of drugs , sex and rock ' n ' roll			1
the music he played , he said , was sacred			2
not many ordinary @entity63 i know would eject their @entity197 cds to listen to @entity6 's sitar			1
he 's not on top - 40 lists			0
but @entity6 's gift went beyond his skills on the strings			2
he possessed an uncommon ability to reach across cultures			0
he introduced the traditions of my homeland to my friends in @entity87			0
and he did it by touching their souls			0

@entity6 transcended difficult boundaries between @entity4 and @entity5
he had a way of making the complexities of @entity63 classical music *accessible* to people
the writer recalls the first time she heard him play
he was a name @entity63 uttered when they wanted to boast of their homeland
