the issues of education and child labor are intimately linked together , he said , " because one of the reasons that girls in particular do n't go to school is because they are working , often in difficult and dangerous circumstances , trying to earn money for their families			0

" unfortunately , that voice has n't been welcome in @entity5 in the way that we would 've hoped and the work that needs to be done to fulfill the dreams that @entity4 has , has not yet begun			1
" @entity5 's politicians have become very good at paying lip service to the needs of @entity5 's children without doing any of the hard work that 's needed			1
" @entity5 needs to dramatically increase its spending on education and improve how that money is spent , he said , and it " needs to get serious " about giving every child a good education			2
