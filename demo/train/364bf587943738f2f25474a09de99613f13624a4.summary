as the sun set thursday in the @entity2 , did two @entity4 captives -- one a @entity6 pilot , the other a @entity8 journalist -- fall with it ? that was the question following a new message , purportedly from the terrorist group , that pushed @entity6 to bring convicted terrorist @entity12 to the @entity14 border by 5:30 p.m. ( 9:30 a.m. et )			1
if they did n't , according to the message , @entity6 pilot @entity15 would be killed , followed soon thereafter by @entity18 of @entity8			1
for days , @entity6 officials have said they 're willing to swap @entity20 for @entity21			2
@entity23 spokesman @entity22 reiterated as much late thursday afternoon , about an hour before the purported deadline			0
he said @entity6 is not about to pull off a deal yet , having received no proof that its pilot is still alive			1
" we need a proof of life so we can proceed , " the government spokesman said			0
if @entity6 gets such proof and releases @entity20 , it is not clear whether that would mean @entity18 also goes free			2
@entity36 , for that matter			0
so the drama continues , with so much unsettled and so much on the line			0
early friday , @entity8 's foreign minister described the situation as " still fluid and changing			1
" " we need to continue to deal with this in a state of alert , " @entity42 told reporters			0
@entity4 has shown its willingness to kill hostages before , the first being @entity50 journalist @entity49 last summer and the latest being @entity51 , an aspiring security contractor from @entity8 reportedly killed last week			1
but is it willing to negotiate with governments that are fighting to stop its brutal , expansive campaign to expand what it calls the @entity57 ? the drama is coming after the latest message posted by @entity4 supporters , purportedly featuring @entity18 's voice			2
@entity0 could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message , which was read by a person claiming to be @entity18 and posted online by @entity4 supporters			0
@entity65 said that " the competent authorities ( in his government ) are still checking on the authenticity of the recent recording , " state tv reported about two hours before the possible deadline			0
it follows another recording in which @entity4 at first demanded $ 200 million to free @entity18 and @entity51			0
a few days later , there was a new message -- this one with a man 's voice claiming to be @entity18 , saying that the terror group was dropping its ransom request and instead demanding a swap of the @entity8 journalist for @entity20			1
in the third recording in this string , @entity18 purportedly gives @entity6 24 hours to release the convicted terrorist in " exchange for my life			1
" @entity6 foreign minister @entity88 had said his country would release @entity90 if @entity4 released @entity15			1
@entity88 has said that the @entity8 journalist has not been forgotten			2
" of course , " @entity18 's release would be part of a prisoner exchange , @entity88 said			2
but the priority for @entity6 , he made clear , is @entity21 's freedom			1
who are those involved in this complicated crisis involving several countries ? @entity101 is an @entity102 prisoner on death row in @entity6 for her role in 2005 bombings			2
@entity18 , an experienced war journalist , has been at the center of several threats by @entity4 since his capture			0
last week , the group demanded $ 200 million from @entity8 in exchange for @entity112 and fellow @entity8 hostage @entity113 , an aspiring security contractor			1
since then , @entity4 has claimed @entity113 is dead , but @entity18 is still alive			0
@entity115 was captured by @entity4 last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in @entity117			0
@entity4 says he 's still alive , but @entity6 's foreign minister told @entity0 his government has asked for a proof of life , but has n't received it			1
they are not just captives , but people with loved ones desperately seeking their release			0
the 47 - year - old @entity18 left @entity8 last fall , when his youngest of two daughters was a mere 3 weeks old			2
now his family -- including his wife , @entity129 , who heard from his captors first on december 2 and most recently in a wednesday email with their " final demand " -- wants him back			2
" my husband is a good and honest man who went to @entity117 to show the plight of those who suffer , " she said in a statement released through the @entity134 , a nonprofit focused on freelance journalists			0
" ... " i beg the @entity6 and @entity8 government to understand that the fates of both ( @entity112 and @entity21 ) are in their hands			1
" relatives of the @entity6 pilot -- captured after he ejected from his f - 16 jet last month near @entity146 , the extremist group 's de facto capital in @entity117 -- have also been outspoken , pressing officials in @entity149 to do all they can to secure his release			1
" i firmly ask whomever has sent @entity15 to fight outside the borders of @entity6 , on a mission unrelated to us , to make strong efforts to bring back @entity15 , " the captive 's father , @entity151 , said tuesday , adding that he believes his son 's situation and @entity18 's should n't be mixed up			1
@entity151 made his case again thursday evening , after the sunset deadline had passed			0
" i ask you in the name of @entity165 and his @entity166 and all the believers and the names of tens of millions in @entity6 and @entity169 , in kindness , to release my son and the son of all @entity6 , who is your brother in the @entity174 religion and because forgiveness is a message of the @entity166 , " he told reporters			1
@entity0 's @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186 contributed to this report			0
journalist @entity188 also contributed to this report .			0
