more than 80 % of children in @entity1 live in high - poverty areas , according to a recent report			1
that 's a sharp difference from national figures measured by the same study , which indicates that 11 % of minors across the @entity8 live in high - poverty areas			1
" what this implies is that the children of @entity1 are facing really great difficulties in order to have the appropriate resources to develop			1
whether it is because in their homes there are not enough resources or because in the community where they live there are not enough resources , " said @entity16 , senior research analyst at the @entity17			0
the study , released last week by the @entity27 and the @entity17 using data from the @entity8 @entity29 , showed that the percentage of @entity1 's teenagers who are not in school or working is higher than in any @entity8 state ; at 18 % , the rate is twice as high as the national @entity8 figure , according to the @entity17			1
the report says 56 % of @entity39 children live in poverty , compared with 22 % for the entire @entity8			1
for the leaders of the communities along the @entity44 in @entity45 , these statistics give a glimpse what their children live every day			2
of the communities ' 26,000 residents , 23 % are minors			0
many of them go to school without supplies			0
and according to their directors , sometimes the schools themselves do n't have the necessary materials for basic studies			0
but this is n't the greatest problem			0
one of the most worrying issues here is public health , community leaders say , because the community does not have a sewage system			1
on rainy days , water flows into the canal , forcing wastewater back into pipes and causing floods that sometimes reach inside homes			0
" what keeps impacting us is the problem of polluted water			0
... our children have to put their feet in polluted water			0
the kids sometimes see little turtles that come out of the canal and they want to pick them up , " said @entity81 , a community leader			0
the canal community has more than 80 leaders who say they are actively working to improve the lives of residents -- and their children -- with or without the help of the island 's government			1
according to the @entity29 , @entity1 's poverty rate is about 45 % -- three times the national @entity8 figure			1
@entity39 government statistics indicate 640,000 families on the island receive food stamps			1
@entity100 , of the @entity17 civil rights group , said officials should devote more resources to helping families on the island			0
" when a large majority of our children live in high - poverty areas , in single - parent families , and with parents who lack secure employment , we can not ignore the threats to their well - being , " she said			2
" if we focus on helping families , then our children will do better			2
we must target our limited resources to strengthen our children 's prospects and help prepare them for the future			2
