there was nothing to separate @entity3 and @entity4 after the group stage at the @entity6 so lots had to be drawn to decide which team would progress to the quarterfinals			1
on this occasion , luck favored @entity3 , one of the nations in west africa ravaged by the ebola virus			2
it was a rare -- the last time lots were drawn at the continental tournament was in 1988 -- and unfair way to settle second place in @entity21 according to both managers but ultimately it 's @entity3 boss @entity24 and his team that will face @entity26 on sunday in @entity27 , @entity3			1
two balls , numbered ' 2 ' for second place and ' 3 ' for third place , were placed in a bowl and the rest was left to chance thursday			0
" @entity36 , from the @entity37 of the @entity38 picked the ball numbered ' 2 ' and @entity40 , president of the @entity41 was the loser after picking out ball number ' 3 , ' " @entity14 's governing body said on its website			0
the outcome left @entity40 in tears and former @entity4 international @entity46 tweeted his displeasure about the method used to separate the sides			0
guinea last beat @entity26 in 1977 , a year after registering its best showing at the @entity6 by making the final			1
in the three other quarterfinals : @entity55 faces @entity56 , @entity54 plays host @entity3 and @entity58 meets @entity58 .			0

@entity3 *benefits* from the luck of the ' draw ' at @entity6
@entity3 , not @entity4 , makes the last eight after lots drawn
they could *n't* be separated on head to head , goals *scored* and goal *difference*
@entity3 faces @entity26 on sunday
