@entity0 -- the day did not start well			1
@entity2 , thunder and torrential rain poured down over @entity5 , @entity0 , where i had come to watch a civil war reenactment			1
in 1864 , here in @entity10 , the @entity8 made one of their most daring and northerly guerrilla raids of the war			1
each year , enthusiasts from the @entity15 and @entity8 remember that battle			1
@entity18 train : no better way to connect with @entity21 voters i have chosen to leave @entity18 's @entity24 train in @entity0 , because this swing state is in play -- with president @entity27 and @entity29 presidential nominee @entity28 jockeying for the lead			1
while @entity0 's six @entity32 votes may be few , at this stage of the campaign every one counts			1
and @entity0 has split the last 10 elections five to five @entity29 and @entity37 ( although more @entity37 since 1988 )			1
crucially it has voted for the winner in seven of those ten races			2
this swing state could be a barometer of the way other swing states are trending			1
so i am at the battle ground , watching the men and women dressed in period costumes and waiting for the storms to subside ( they will fight in the rain , but holding metal tipped muskets in the air is too dangerous with lightning )			0
the attention to detail is impressive			0
@entity57 's 19th century wisdom for 20th century problem the players each have individual characters and play them with gusto , rarely coming out of role			2
one soldier would only answer me as if we were still in 1861			0
another believed @entity57 had the right answers for today too			0
with muskets set aside , it soon became clear why this is a swing state			1
a @entity71 soldier said it was only now that people like him were really focusing on their choices			0
his @entity76 rival bemoaned the deceit in the campaign , which made it hard to know who was telling the truth			2
and the civil war nurse , tending to her potions and lotions , admitted it was hard to know who was best			2
@entity87 begins in @entity27 country at the core of the election , all agreed , was the role of government in @entity21			1
getting government " out of our lives " was the constant refrain			2
government had gone too far , they believed			2
" a return to the @entity101 " was needed i was told , again and again			0
there needed to be more respect for individual freedoms			0
" government " was the problem , not the solution			2
nowhere was this more crystallized than on the issue of gun control			0
i would hardly expect men and women running around the @entity0 countryside brandishing civil war weaponry to favor stricter gun laws , but they believed their " right to bear arms , " enshrined in the second amendment , was under threat			1
although neither candidate has really taken up the issue of gun control , here there was a stronger @entity125 tone			0
@entity28 was the candidate of choice			0
@entity128 life : an @entity21 without sound bites this " role of government " theme is now at the heart of the election			1
it permeates all issues : economic : should the government have rescued the banks in 2008 ? @entity139 : is it the government 's business to legislate on marriage ? in commerce the phrase i keep hearing is , " get government off the backs of business , " and in issues seen as highly personal , the refrain is " that 's none of the government 's damned business			1
" @entity21 seem to want everything and nothing from their government at the same time			1
it is the great contradiction of this country , which makes covering its elections so fascinating			2
it is perfectly displayed on this civil war field in the views of the soldiers and their families			0
the @entity21 election : the world looking in in this battle both sides agreed to let the @entity8 win , as they did in 1864			1
tomorrow it will be the @entity15 ' turn to enjoy victory			0
i guarantee that the election for @entity0 's six electoral votes will see no such gentlemanly agreement			1
they will be fought for with the passion , but thankfully , not the violence of their predecessors			0
i wo n't be here to see @entity71 victory			0
i have a train to catch			0
the horn of the @entity24 is calling and @entity184 is a night ride away .			0

@entity1 's @entity187 is in @entity10 , where in 1864 the @entity8 made one of their most daring raids of the war
he is in the @entity21 as part of @entity87 , a *series* on the election airing from *october* 29
**quest** stops in @entity0 because it is a swing state which often votes for the election winner
**quest** finds the " role of government " theme is at the heart of the election , permeating all of the country 's issues
