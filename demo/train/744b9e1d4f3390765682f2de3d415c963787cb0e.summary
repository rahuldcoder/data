-- for years @entity1 has embraced " setsuden " -- " saving electricity " -- during the country 's hot summer months			1
among other measures , businessmen and women are encouraged to wear casual summer clothing in the office and to turn the thermostat up on the air conditioning by a few degrees			0
but this year the concept has been given a new significance as the nuclear crisis in @entity15 has restricted the country 's energy supplies and brought " teiden taisaku " ( " blackout countermeasures " ) into the mix. starting this month the @entity1 government has called for a 15 % cut in electricity use in @entity23 and the @entity24 to avoid blackouts and power shortages			1
@entity1 environment minister @entity27 last month said that the reduction would not be a temporary measure , but an event to change people 's lifestyles			2
to complement the official " setsuden " advice , @entity1 's graphic designers have been engaging in some traditional means to help encourage citizens do their part -- providing public information posters			1
every day public tv in @entity1 encourages people to save energy , says @entity23 resident @entity42 , who set up a blog for the posters			1
@entity42 has been documenting where the posters have been appearing across @entity23 , from convenience stores to around the @entity50 , and he says , the response to energy saving requests can be seen across the city			1
" lights are turned off in vending machines and many station escalators are only working half of the time , " says @entity42			0
if traditional means of raising public opinion are on the rise , so too are traditional ways to combat summer heat , says @entity42			0
" in private many people are stopping to use air - conditioning and started using ' uchiwa ' -- a round paper fan , " he says			0
on a larger scale businesses have adopted their own energy saving methods			2
according to the @entity69 , from wednesday the @entity68 will change weekends for employees to sundays and wednesdays to help easy the power load on the electricity grid during the working week			0
@entity74 and @entity75 are growing green curtains of plants to cover factory walls and encouraging their employees to do the same , according to @entity80 .			0
