-- running along the banks of the @entity3 sunday , i take a lap around the giant hot air balloon in the south of @entity7 hovering gently over the @entity8			1
essentially a giant weather balloon , its leds sparkled green -- @entity7 air quality is just fine , a significant change from just two days before , friday march 14 , when the light flashed ominously red			1
friday 's visibility levels were so bad that most @entity15 could n't even see the balloon -- let alone the @entity17			2
warmer temperatures and scarce winds caused particulate levels to reach record highs , spurring the city into action			2
@entity7 ' @entity24 launched unprecedented policies aimed at reducing traffic in and around the city			1
according to @entity34 of the @entity35 , @entity7 's transit authority , for the first time ever public transportation including the metro , regional trains , trams and buses were all free			1
supplementary trains added 600,000 to 1 million seats across the various lines			0
it cost the city around € 4 million ( $ 5.6 million ) per day			0
the measure , @entity34 said , encouraged those who would normally take their cars to opt for public transport			1
the city also waived fees for the popular bike - sharing program , the @entity49 , as well as the electric car share , @entity51			2
both services saw 61 % and 31 % increases respectively during a five day period , according to @entity24			0
but do these measures ever actually help to improve air quality long - term ? varied results to date there are some precedents			1
a 2013 study suggests that @entity61 's particulate levels dropped by 20 % thanks to its 2008 driving restrictions			2
excessive restrictions during a religious celebration reportedly cut 30,000 tons of carbon emissions in @entity66 by abstaining from almost all carbon - producing activities			2
however , a partial car ban in @entity69 actually increased air pollution according to one study , as drivers bought extra vehicles			1
@entity15 were warned to avoid strenuous activity as a result of the air , but runners were n't about to ditch the final weeks of marathon training before the @entity79 on april 6			1
@entity80 organizes group runs through @entity82 , but thursday night 's event just before the pollution hit its peak on friday was an ordeal			2
" we really felt it			0
it was impossible to breath , " @entity89 says			0
by sunday , the air cleared up and i joined dozens of runners huffing along the riverbank			2
for the rest of @entity7 , free transport was the cherry on top of an otherwise perfect sunday as the air quality improved -- momentarily			1
@entity101 , an @entity103 living in @entity7 , took advantage of the system , though said the smog was unbearable on friday as she rode a @entity49			2
on sunday , she took the @entity108 c train to @entity109 for some sightseeing at one of the world 's most famous chateaux			0
" i went for the first time in over a year			0
the free ride facilitates things enormously , " she says			0
come monday , it was a different story			0
pollution flared again , and as @entity15 headed to work , a system was implemented to allow only those cars with odd number license plates within @entity7 , with free parking for even numbered plates			1
certain exceptions were noted on the city 's website , including electric and hybrid cars , and vehicles carrying three or more people			0
the short - term improvements in air quality are most likely due to changing weather conditions , and not temporary car bans , says @entity134 , an engineer at @entity7 's air quality control @entity136			1
nevertheless government intervention is still positive , she says			0
" every solution that can reduce emissions is good for air quality , " she says			1
" for one day , it 's a good emergency solution			0
" long - term measures required a study in @entity144 and other cities concluded that certain restrictions can alleviate extreme spikes in pollution , but only long - term measures will actually improve air quality			1
@entity150 erupted with @entity15 complaining about the restrictions as disruptions hit regional trains to the suburbs including the @entity155 and @entity156 around 4,000 defiant drivers were stopped on the way into the city at check points like the @entity161 and @entity162 by an added force of traffic police and fined € 22 ( $ 31 )			0
for those who could n't drive , @entity35 maintained its free transport through monday evening , and the measures ended tuesday			1
the effectiveness of the free transportation will be hard to measure , and may be speculative at best			0
at many stations , access doors were simply left open , preventing an official count of those going through turnstiles or scanning passes , @entity34 said			0
with no official figures available , she said that traffic volume on @entity35 facilities felt normal			0
the situation has , however , opened the door for the inevitable capitalization by politicians vying for votes in this month 's elections			0
socialist candidate @entity187 called for electric buses to replace diesel ones on @entity35 lines , as well as implementing an electric scooter - sharing program , dubbed @entity192			0
@entity194 candidate @entity193 used the pollution to criticize @entity187 's party for a lack of environmental action			0
even @entity199 chimed in , using the event to push its 100 % electric cars as a response to the driving restrictions with a well - placed @entity150 ad			2
while some may be capitalizing on an otherwise discouraging few days , this weekend has been a wake - up call for @entity15 , making air pollution a concrete issue for the first time			1
and @entity7 is not alone , as parts of southern @entity210 are reporting increasingly poor air quality			1
@entity212 , cofounder of @entity213 , the agency that designed @entity7 ' weather balloon , said that the weekend 's spike in pollution is rare , but everyone is participating in the conversation now			1
" friday was the worst i 've ever seen , " he said , " but i think people are finally paying attention to air quality			1
" @entity223 is a freelance correspondent based in @entity7 .			2

@entity7 made public transport free and partially banned cars to contain pollution levels this week
drivers *unhappy* , though some report improved air quality as a result
biggest changes likely due to weather , long - term measures needed say campaigners
