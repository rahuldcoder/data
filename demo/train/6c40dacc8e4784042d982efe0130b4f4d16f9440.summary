it is 10 years after the invasion of @entity2 , and images of @entity2 women from various political parties are filling the streets of @entity7 ahead of april 's local elections -- a sign to casual observers that women 's equality is on track in this war - ravaged country			1
but although the women of @entity2 have obtained some benefits on paper , the reality is that they have lost far more than they have gained since the war began in 2003			1
on the political front , @entity2 prime minister @entity21 has not appointed a single woman to a senior cabinet position , despite the fact women are guaranteed 25 % of the seats in parliament by the constitution			1
the @entity30 , a poorly - funded and mostly ceremonial department , is the lone ministry headed up by a woman			0
full coverage : the @entity33 , 10 years on constitutionally , women were able to secure the ability to pass their citizenship on to their children by @entity39 husbands , making @entity2 one of a handful @entity42 countries with such a provision for their female citizens			1
but on the other hand , women are no longer guaranteed equal treatment under one law in terms of marriage , divorce , inheritance and custody			1
that law , the @entity56 , has been replaced one giving religious and tribal leaders the power to regulate family affairs in the areas they rule in accordance with their interpretation of religious laws			2
this not only is making women more vulnerable , it is giving women from various sects ( @entity73 or @entity74 ) or religion ( @entity75 or @entity76 ) different legal treatments on the same issues			0
exclusive : @entity79 on ' terrible mistake ' in @entity2 economically , women have gone from being visibly active in the @entity2 work force in the 1980s -- particularly in the farming , marketing and professional services sectors -- to being nearly non-existent in 2013			2
the women who could afford it withdrew from the public space due the violence dominating the streets			2
10 years ago @entity2 produced much of its own food and had a productive industrial sector -- but now @entity2 imports practically all of its food , and farmers and factory workers simply found themselves out of a job as industry ground to a halt			0
and while both women and men suffered as a result , the impact on women was greater due to their limited mobility in the face of poor security			0
@entity108 : @entity2 suffocates in cloak of sorrow violence against women -- and the lack of legal protection for women -- is also on the rise			1
women 's rights groups blame the increase in violence on the social and economic pressure that families face , the lack of public and political will to stop it , and the increase religious conservatism that often justifies the violence			0
the saddest part of the story is the lost memory of what @entity2 women once were			1
i grew up in @entity7 with a working mother who drove herself to the office and always told me that i could anything i wanted with my life			0
my mother 's friends were factory managers , artists , principals and doctors			0
it has been just over 20 years since i left @entity2			0
today , female college students ask me if it is true that the streets of @entity7 were once full of women driving , that women could walk around in public at all times of the day without worry , that university campuses were once filled with women who did not wearing headscarves			0
it would be unfair to blame the regression @entity2 women have faced only on the last 10 years , as the previous decade of economic sanctions that preceded it also took its toll on @entity2 society			1
but it is necessary to observe -- especially in light of all the changes that are happening in @entity162 countries -- that female political participation in a country 's democratic process can not be the end of the story			0
women 's active economic and social engagement is just as crucial to society as it is to their own wellbeing			0
@entity171 entered @entity2 in 2003 with lots of promises , but women 's rights were not even on the radar screen			2
ten years later , @entity2 women find themselves the subjects of a story that does not have a happy ending			1
but despite the challenges that face them , some @entity2 women continue to stand up for women 's rights			1
they deserve everyone 's support , for the story of women 's rights is the story of @entity2 's future .			2

@entity2 women have lost more than they *'ve* gained since @entity33 began in 2003
women no longer guaranteed equal treatment under @entity56
violence against women is also on the rise
