ever since musician @entity0 met a patient with locked in syndrome 11 years ago , he has been on a mission to create a way for the paralyzed to make music			1
his latest invention is the brain computer music interface ( @entity10 ) which allows people to create music using just their eyes			1
how it works by connecting electrodes to the back of the head , the system can tell where you 're looking by monitoring brain activity			1
flashing icons representing different snippets of music appear on screen and you can make a selection , just by staring at one			1
in real time , a musician plays a score generated from the user 's selections			2
" our brain is producing electricity all the time , " says @entity33 , head of the @entity34 for @entity35 at @entity36			1
" these are very faint electrical signals but we can amplify and analyze them			0
let 's say you have two icons on the computer screen : one flashing at 10 hertz and the other flashing at 15 hertz			0
if you look at the one flashing at 15 hertz , we can detect it			0
" " we can detect up to eight different frequencies at the moment , " explains @entity0 who is helped by a team of doctoral students and research assistants at his lab. " my latest composition is for a string quartet			1
it 's an interaction between eight people , four of them generating music and the others playing the music as its being generated			1
" the score for the quartet is a computer monitor rather than sheet music so the musicians have to be quite skilled and perform the piece as it 's generated			2
" listen to @entity33 's string quartet playing using the @entity10			0
motivation speaking of his inspiration for the project , @entity33 says : " i wanted to create something to enable people with severe disabilities to make music			1
i was struck by an encounter i had once with a man who had had a stroke and was paralyzed completely from the neck down			0
" that had a profound impact on me and i thought , as a musician , how i could provide a voice for him -- that 's where this research began			1
" he adds : " a few years ago i tested a prototype with a paralyzed patient in a hospital in @entity92 he was able to play music by looking as these icons			2
the nurses and carers there told me that one of the things that these patients really miss is interaction with other people , not with machines			2
that 's how this system was created			1
" funding it has been 11 years since @entity33 started his lab , with financial support from @entity36 as well as securing funding throughout the years			1
he has also been successful in securing funding from engineering organizations such as the @entity117 's @entity116			0
" it was very difficult at the beginning to convince people that this research could work and produce something useful			1
it sounded like science fiction to begin with , people did n't believe it			2
but as i began to produce results , papers and scientific journals , it became easier to put the arguments on paper			0
" future plans @entity33 is now working on making the system more robust and user - friendly			2
but it might be a while before his technology hits the shops , not least because it costs around Â£ 10,000 ( around $ 15,600 )			0
" i do n't think i would sell the @entity10 , the problem is that the hardware is very expensive ... all the electrodes you need we have to buy ourselves			2
" i would be quite happy to give away the software to people who really need it , provided they are able to buy the hardware			0
" " we have seen companies selling equipment ( at ) a tenth of the price of ours promising a lot of things , but when you really test them they do n't compare to ours			0
" it 's going to take a long time for this to become cheap , " he says			0
but you may soon be able to try out the software in your local " brain booth			0
" " we are working on a project , which will allow the public to use the system in a ' brain booth ' and download the music they create from the internet afterward			1
" you do n't need musical talent to use the system , but the more you understand music the easier it is for you -- if you understand for example that crochets are quicker than semi-quavers you have an idea of what you 're selecting -- but after 10 seconds you hear the snippet of music you chose being played by the string quartet , so you learn quickly			1
" @entity185 , from the @entity186 , who was involved with a similar project , thinks the technology could have wider applications			0
" it was amazing to explore how technology can help to unleash the creativity within people that they may find difficulty expressing through traditional methods			0
" " we 're also looking forward to seeing how brain - wave technology might , in the near future , be able to control other types of equipment such as wheelchairs or computers , " she says .			0

@entity0 has created a system which allows people to make music using their eyes
the system uses electrodes and was inspired by people suffering from paralysis
the musician and professor has a research lab at the @entity36
