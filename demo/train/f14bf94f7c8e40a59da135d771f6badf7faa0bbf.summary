-- @entity3 's high profile lawyer @entity1 is demanding @entity4 take action to block tweets that draw upon the material hackers took from the corporation 's computer servers			1
he wants the accounts of those who post the stolen emails to be suspended			2
earlier , @entity1 wrote to news organizations admonishing them that they should not publish stories based on the company 's stolen secrets			1
gossip - hungry media consumers have been enjoying a feast of salacious celebrity fare from the hacked computers of @entity3			1
the @entity22 government says @entity23 is responsible for the hacking , which apparently was prompted by a @entity3 movie , " @entity26			1
" @entity28 leader @entity27 , a man who loves movies but bans virtually all contact between computer , videos and his own starving citizens , is apparently unamused at the film , which makes a joke of his imaginary assassination			2
in the aftermath of a clearly criminal invasion of @entity3 's computer system and the cybertheft of thousands upon thousands of documents , emails and related data , the press immediately started publishing the stolen goods			1
the media then self - righteously asserted that the @entity47 protects its right to publish even stolen material if it relates to " matters of public concern			1
" this wording emanates from the only @entity54 case somewhat " on point " as we lawyers like to say			0
the case is @entity59 ( 2001 )			0
but is it really on point ? the court 's ruling in the @entity65 case affirmed the right of a @entity68 radio show host to play the contents of an illegally recorded cellular telephone conversation over the airwaves			1
the private conversation between a union president and his union 's negotiator related to collective bargaining between a teachers ' union and a local municipality			0
this private conversation would later be blessed by the @entity54 majority of justices @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 as a " matter of public concern " fully protected by the @entity47 despite the criminality and invasion of privacy clearly associated with the way the recording was obtained			2
a strong and lengthy dissent , however , was filed by chief justice @entity95 , who was joined by justices @entity96 and @entity98			0
@entity95 , a conservative appointed to the court by @entity101 and later elevated to the chief justice position by @entity103 , was quite prescient about future privacy issues for a man who was born 60 years before email came into widespread use			1
the words from his dissenting opinion may provide the basis for a re-evaluation of the @entity65 decision and a needed reassertion of privacy rights in the @entity22			0
the @entity65 rationale is being used to reward the actions of the @entity28 dictator , assuming his government has masterminded the hack			0
as @entity95 observed , the downside of our reliance on electronic communication is that " we are placed in the uncomfortable position of not knowing who might have access to our personal and business emails , our medical and financial records , or our cordless and cellular telephone conversations			0
@entity95 objected to the court majority 's ruling that federal and state laws against intercepting electronic communications violated the @entity47			1
" the court 's decision diminishes , rather than enhances , the purposes of the @entity47 : chilling the speech of the millions of @entity22 who rely upon electronic technology to communicate each day			2
... " surely , he wrote , " the interest in individual privacy , ... at its narrowest must embrace the right to be free from surreptitious eavesdropping on , and involuntary broadcast of , our cellular telephone conversations			2
" in the @entity3 case , the invasion of the corporation 's privacy revealed such minutiae as a movie producer 's disparaging judgment of @entity158 ( " a minimally talented spoiled brat " ) , suggestions that @entity3 engages in wage discrimination against not only its female employees but also its female movie stars , and tasteless jokes from executives about whether the president liked black - themed movies			2
is this really information protected by the @entity47 ? should those who profit from the disclosure of this cybertrash remain exempt from prosecution either criminal or civil ? are these items that the @entity54 believes are " matters of public concern ? " the law and the @entity22 @entity54 have been outrun by technology 's rapid advance and we need a more carefully calculated balance between privacy , property rights and the @entity47			0
the amendment as worded was intended to protect political speech , not the dissemination of stolen email and salacious gossip from corporations			1
knowing possession of stolen property is almost always a crime and trying to dress it up as a form of " free speech " places the privacy rights of all @entity22 citizens in danger			1
much of life has moved into the shadow of the computer , tablet and mobile phone 's blue light			0
these devices are increasingly the targets of information theft by sophisticated cybercriminals			0
surely the courts must recognize some privacy rights that are not automatically trumped by a bogus assertion of the @entity47 's " public concern " protection			0
in @entity1 , @entity3 hired one of @entity22 's most famous and successful lawyers to advance the suggestion that those who reveal @entity3 's stolen emails and computer data may face lawsuits for damages			1
not even the @entity47 's wide protective net will permit publication of copyrighted material and such things as personal @entity226 numbers or intimate personal facts about noncelebrity figures who are included in the stolen @entity3 database			1
@entity22 copyright law and the theory of " invasion of privacy " will assure substantial damages to parties legitimately aggrieved			0
and do n't underestimate @entity235			0
he handed out some of the highest bonuses in the legal profession this year , with one associate getting more than $ 300,000			0
if she was the attorney who landed @entity3 as a client , the bonus was obviously well deserved			2
she will also have a busy year in court if the leakage of hacked material continues .			1

@entity3 lawyer @entity1 asks @entity4 to block tweets of stolen company email
@entity250 *questions* a *key* court ruling permitting illegally obtained tapes to be broadcast
@entity250 : @entity254 may be a *greater* value than free speech , given nature of hacked @entity3 material
