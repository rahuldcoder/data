-- supporters of @entity5 , @entity2 's voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage , are asking that a judge 's injunction barring the measure 's enforcement be thrown out because the judge failed to disclose his involvement in a long - term same - sex relationship			1
in august , then - @entity14 chief judge @entity13 ruled the measure violates the @entity17 's equal protection clause			1
" @entity5 does nothing more than enshrine in the @entity20 the notion that opposite - sex couples are superior to same - sex couples , " @entity13 wrote in his 136 - page opinion			1
but on april 6 , @entity13 ended months of speculation by publicly disclosing " that he is gay and that he has been in a committed relationship for more than 10 years , " said a motion filed monday by @entity5 backers			1
in previous press reports , according to the motion , @entity13 refused comment on his sexual orientation			2
while the press reports do not address the question of whether @entity13 and his partner have any interest in marrying , the motion said , @entity13 should have either recused himself from the case or disclosed his sexual orientation " so that the parties could consider and decide , before the case proceeded further , whether to request his recusal			1
" @entity13 , who retired at the end of february , told reporters earlier this month he did n't think it was appropriate for any judge 's sexual orientation , ethnicity , national origin or gender to stop them from presiding over a case , according to a @entity51 report			2
" that 's a very slippery slope , " said @entity13 , who was appointed to the federal bench in 1989 by president @entity53			2
but , argues the motion filed monday , if @entity13 and his partner ever wanted -- or thought they might want -- to marry , he " plainly had an ' interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding , ' " it said , citing federal law regarding disqualification of judges			2
" only if chief judge @entity13 had unequivocally disavowed any interest in marrying his partner could the parties and the public be confident that he did not have a direct personal interest in the outcome of the case , " the motion said			1
same - sex marriage advocates decried the move			1
" supporters of @entity5 are grasping at straws because they do n't like the outcome , " said @entity74 of the @entity75			1
" if their real intent was to ' protect marriage , ' they should argue that a straight married judge be disqualified since he would conceivably have an interest in protecting his own marriage			2
the argument is simply ridiculous on its face			1
" however , @entity86 , senior fellow for policy studies at the conservative @entity88 , said he supports the motion			0
" the fact that judge @entity13 was biased in a generic sense was obvious from his decision itself , " @entity86 said			1
" but the revelation that he has been in a long - term homosexual relationship demonstrates that he had a very specific interest in the case which should have been disclosed			2
" " i think there is zero chance of the decision being overturned because of this purported conflict , but it might have been wiser for @entity103 to make this disclosure before taking on the case , " said @entity98 , @entity0 legal analyst			0
the motion says that proceedings in the case have been " marked by a number of irregular and unprecedented rulings , both procedural and substantive , that give gravely disquieting force to the ' appearance of partiality ' created by the belated disclosure of chief judge @entity13 's long - term , committed relationship			1
" it cites several examples , among them the fact that @entity13 refused to stay his judgment pending appeal despite its " unprecedented nature ... and its sharp conflict with the uniform judgment of appellate courts throughout the country			2
" as a result , the motion argues , the @entity126 was forced to issue such a stay			0
the @entity5 backers emphasize that in the motion , they are not suggesting a gay or lesbian judge could not hear the case -- only that no judge should try a case where they might have an interest in the outcome			2
" we deeply regret the necessity of this motion , " it says			0
" in this case , it is undeniable that chief judge @entity13 failed to make the required disclosure			1
at no point prior to the entry of judgment did chief judge @entity13 disclose that he is in a now 10 - year long , committed same - sex relationship			1
and he has yet to disclose whether he has any interest in marrying his partner should the injunction he issued be upheld on appeal , " the motion said			0
" ... simply stated , under governing @entity2 law , chief judge @entity13 currently can not marry his partner , but his decision in this case , and the sweeping injunction he entered to enforce it , would give him a right to do so			1
" @entity98 said the @entity5 supporters were not saying the judge should n't have heard the case because he is gay			1
" they 're saying he could n't hear the case because he was in precisely the kind of relationship that would be affected by his decision , " he explained			0
" i still think that is not necessarily disqualifying , because judges deal with issues that affect them in a broad sense all the time , but it might have been a better practice to put the cards on the table , " he said			0
" ... it gets to be a closer question when it 's not just the general group affected , but the precise sub-group whose rights are at issue in the case			0
" while the argument is a legitimate one , @entity98 predicted it will not succeed			0
" it 's all part of the strategy of litigating a high - profile case			0
you look for every advantage you can			0
" but , " if @entity13 was willing to say something publicly after the case , he probably should have been willing to say something before the case , " he said			0
" ... i think disclosure is almost always the better practice			0
" the civil rights challenge remains at the @entity126 , and the issue remains unresolved , although a ruling is expected later this year			0
the court in december set aside @entity13 's decision , which would have allowed same - sex marriages to resume in @entity2			1
@entity13 's ruling assured a swift federal appeal that ultimately may reach the @entity14 @entity201			0
one sticking point could be whether @entity5 supporters in court -- all private citizens and groups -- have legal " standing " to continue appealing the case			2
if the appeals court rules they do not , the @entity201 may not wade into the issue , some legal experts have said , giving no clear guidance on the constitutionality of same - sex marriage nationwide			1
the high court , in a 1997 unrelated appeal , expressed " grave doubts " about the ability of such private groups to challenge rulings that strike down ballot initiatives			0
the state 's high court had allowed same - sex marriages in @entity2 , but then @entity5 passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008			1
prior to @entity13 's ruling , the @entity2 @entity201 allowed that initiative to stand , saying it represented the will of the people			0
@entity0 's @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0

@entity75 : " the argument is simply ridiculous "
former judge @entity13 blocked enforcement of @entity5
after his retirement , he confirmed he is involved in a same - sex relationship
supporters of the same - sex marriage ban say @entity13 should have disclosed that
