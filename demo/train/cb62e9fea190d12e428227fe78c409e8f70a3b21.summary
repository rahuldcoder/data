@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 family has long been accustomed to prolonged absences from their seafaring patriarch			1
in fact , run - ins with the law were not unusual , given the fact that @entity4 had spent decades working for the environmental activist group @entity11 , which is well - known for its provocative , headline - grabbing protests			1
but no one expected the 60 - year - old mariner to end up languishing in a @entity16 jail in the @entity17 , facing up to 15 years in prison on charges of piracy			1
" the situation he 's in now is just way too extreme , " said his wife , @entity21			2
she and other members of the @entity4 family spoke to @entity2 in their first media interviews since @entity16 authorities arrested 30 passengers and crew members aboard the @entity11 ship @entity30 last month			1
" the activists have found themselves embroiled in something that has larger implications , " added @entity31			0
she married @entity4 , the captain of the @entity30 , in february after the two had been friends for decades			2
" he 's a very sweet , sweet man , and yet he 's this stalwart person in the face of any kind of crisis like what 's going on now , " said the newlywed			1
@entity4 , a native of @entity41 , @entity42 , is the sole @entity43 citizen in a group of activists @entity11 is now calling the " @entity17 30			1
" the 30 detainees include volunteers and crew members from @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 as well as a @entity16 freelance photographer and ship cooks from @entity55 and @entity56			1
what happened in the @entity58 on september 18 , two @entity11 activists from the @entity30 attempted to scale an oil rig operated by the @entity16 energy @entity61			1
they were planning to protest against @entity61 's plans to drill for oil in the @entity58			2
the @entity65 of the @entity16 later released an unedited video showing the tense stand - off that ensued			2
two inflatable rafts operated by mask - wearing @entity16 security forces approached the platform			2
one @entity16 officer seized the rope an activist was using to try to climb the looming walls of the platform			2
two other inflatable rafts from @entity11 bobbed near by , periodically being drenched by water cannons fired from the oil platform			2
@entity11 disputes @entity16 's claim it found drugs on ship at one point , someone from above fired a series of shots into the water that struck perilously close to @entity11 boats and @entity16 security rafts			1
@entity11 activists could be seen holding their hands up in the air as a @entity16 officer aimed his pistol at them			1
@entity16 security forces initially detained the two activists who had climbed onto the oil rig			1
later , they commandeered the @entity30 and towed it to the @entity16 port of @entity99			0
there , @entity16 prosecutors pressed charges against all 30 of the detainees			1
@entity4 's 18 - year - old daughter , @entity103 , learned about her father 's arrest during her first weeks as a student at @entity107 in @entity1			1
" i would ask [ the @entity16 ] to open a dictionary and read the definition of piracy , " she said			2
" they tried to board an oil rig			1
they did n't try to hurt anyone			0
they did n't have weapons , " she added			0
according to the @entity119 , the definition of piracy is " any illegal acts of violence or detention , or any act of depredation , committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft			0
" @entity16 's president seems to agree that the charges of piracy do n't match the crime			1
speaking to journalists at an international summit on the @entity17 last month , @entity134 said " it is absolutely evident that they are , of course , not pirates			0
" but , he added , " formally they were trying to seize that platform			0
" a court in @entity99 has denied bail to the @entity17 30			0
on thursday , 11 @entity146 winners wrote a letter to @entity134 , calling on the @entity148 to " reaffirm the right to nonviolent protest " and drop the " excessive charges of piracy " against the activists			2
a legacy of peaceful protesting peaceful protest has long been a way of life in the @entity4 family			0
@entity4 's 91 - year old father , @entity159 , campaigned against discrimination against @entity162 students while studying at @entity163			1
in 1949 , the senior @entity4 founded an interracial housing cooperative in @entity41 , aimed at creating a community with " no discrimination because of race , color , creed or politics			0
" the younger @entity4 was only 12 when his father brought him from @entity42 to the @entity172 to participate in civil rights marches			0
@entity4 " often said that if he was n't arrested by the time he was 21 , he 'd be a great disappointment to his family , " recalled @entity31			0
by the time he was a teenager , @entity4 was working as a crew member aboard the @entity177 , a sailing ship from which the folk singer @entity179 campaigned against pollution on the @entity182			0
" the logical next move was @entity11 , " @entity183 said			0
in 1985 , @entity4 was the captain of the @entity11 ship @entity187 when two explosions ripped through its hull while it was anchored in the port of @entity191 in @entity52			1
the ship sank , killing one passenger on board , @entity195 photographer @entity193			0
a subsequent investigation by @entity52 authorities revealed @entity199 intelligence agents planted bombs on the ship			0
the deadly act of sabotage was apparently aimed at preventing @entity11 from protesting against @entity199 nuclear tests in @entity205			0
@entity206 said her father believed " there 's a lot of people out there that kind of need to be woken up and given a little push ... ' hey , this is what 's really happening and this is what we need to do to slow it down			0
' " but his wife said @entity4 showed some uncharacteristic reluctance before departing for the latest @entity11 mission in the @entity17			1
by the time he was in the region , however , that hesitation appeared to have faded			0
the last postcard he sent to @entity31 during a short stopover in @entity226 included an ominous final sentence : " it will be a pretty cool action if the @entity16 have a sence [ sic ] of humor			0
love you tons , @entity231 " @entity11 vigil for ' @entity17 ' held in @entity16			1

@entity4 is one of 30 @entity11 activists being held in @entity16
the 60 - year - old mariner is facing up to 15 years in prison on charges of piracy
the charges stem from an *incident* at a @entity16 oil rig in september
