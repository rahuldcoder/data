-- just moments after @entity2 triumphantly introduced congressman @entity3 to @entity5 voters on the deck of the battleship @entity8 , i happened to witness a heart - wrenching event on the tarmac of an airport hundreds of miles away : the casket of a fallen service member was returning home to his family in @entity17			1
as i stood silently with a group of passengers watching a small honor guard march to attention , the hearse backing up to the conveyor belt , and the grieving family members holding each other up , i was reminded again that a nation 's foreign policy has direct impact on all our lives			1
if a new president comes to the @entity33 -- if @entity2 and @entity3 win -- will @entity5 find itself once again at war ? how will the election reshape our policies toward the rest of the world ? the selection of @entity3 as @entity2 's running mate has heated the spotlight on the economy , on the huge and growing national debt , and on the large number of @entity5 who , years after the start of recession , remain unemployed			1
sensing @entity49 's vulnerability , @entity2 and @entity3 would like to keep the focus there			1
but international conflicts have a way of intruding on the best agendas of @entity5 statesmen and political strategists			0
president @entity57 did not expect 9/11 ( crazy conspiracy theories aside ) , just as @entity49 had no idea that the @entity61 uprisings would transform a key region of the world and test his skill in a series of conflicts , some of which confronted @entity5 's values against its alliances			1
we do know that whoever sits in the @entity72 will face tough decisions on @entity74 and @entity75 , two problematic countries that are likely to demand attention at or near the top of the foreign policy rundown			1
and , we know that when the next presidential term starts , as many as 68,000 @entity5 service members may remain in @entity82			0
a look at how @entity2 and @entity3 would respond to the challenges facing @entity5 is as revealing as it is stunning			2
the @entity87 duo differs dramatically from @entity49 and vice president @entity88 when it comes to economic policy , but on foreign affairs it 's hard to find a truly sharp disagreement on fundamental issues , despite dissimilarities in tone			1
when it comes to cheering @entity5 's greatness , @entity49 was at first reluctant			2
" i believe in @entity5 exceptionalism , " he famously said , " just as i suspect that the @entity101 believe in @entity103 exceptionalism and the @entity104 believe in @entity104 exceptionalism			0
" he added that he is " enormously proud " of @entity5 , but the qualified statement opened a new flank			0
@entity49 has since learned his lesson about being shy in praising @entity5			2
and so did @entity2 , who tried to draw a distinction with the president by launching his campaign with a book unsubtly titled , " no apology : the case for @entity116			2
" in a speech last year , @entity3 waxed idealistic about @entity5 , talking about the need for " energetic " @entity5 leadership , about the " fundamental desire for liberty " in all human beings and the need to promote our " moral principles			0
" but he quickly pulled the soaring idealism back to earth , saying policy should be " tempered by a healthy humility about the extent of our power			0
" in other words , do not compromise our values unless we have to			0
and , by the way , we have to			0
@entity5 exceptionalism : 2012 winner must unite @entity5 on ideals @entity3 , who has no foreign policy experience and has spoken little of it , outlined the dilemma facing the @entity5 when he spoke about the @entity61 uprisings			1
" we are seeing long - repressed populations giving voice to a fundamental desire for liberty , " he said approvingly , but then he worried about the possibility that the end of one dictatorship would open the way for another			0
regarding @entity82 , the war in which @entity5 are serving and dying , @entity2 and @entity49 have , incredibly , largely avoided the topic			1
despite vague criticisms , @entity2 is on record supporting @entity49 's plan to remove @entity5 forces			1
@entity2 once , a little bafflingly , declared that @entity159 is @entity5 's main foe			2
in reality , whoever wins the election will need @entity159 's cooperation on the global stage to counter vital and urgent problems			0
on @entity74 , arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for @entity5 , both @entity2 and @entity49 have stated that @entity74 must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons			1
both have said " all options " remain on the table to prevent that from happening , including a military strike			0
and despite criticism of @entity49 's approach to @entity177 , @entity2 agrees with @entity49 that @entity177 is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of @entity5 foreign policy			1
@entity2 and @entity3 may ultimately speak more forcefully in public settings about the @entity184 -- and that is easier to do when you do n't yet hold power -- but the fact is that @entity49 has earned high praise from many @entity191 hawks			1
and if you look closely at @entity2 's proposals for @entity74 , what he calls for is more economic sanctions			1
when @entity2 took his recent overseas trip , his objective was to highlight differences with @entity49			1
he drew criticism when he called @entity177 's capital , but that 's exactly what @entity49 said when he was running for office			2
@entity49 went even further , saying " @entity177 will remain the capital of @entity177 and it must remain undivided			2
" to be sure , rhetoric and images matter a lot			0
@entity49 's effort to win over @entity209 , which has largely failed , created the impression that the alliance between @entity177 and the @entity5 is not as strong as it once was			2
that image has real world repercussions			0
and the chill that surrounds meetings between @entity49 and @entity191 prime minister @entity216 is real			2
but the relationship is based on much more than ties of friendship between leaders			0
the two campaigns have differences in some areas , particularly regarding the future @entity225 budget , which @entity49 would cut by $ 500 billion in 10 years			1
@entity2 would spend more to expand the @entity226 , part of a strategy that looks at @entity229 as an upcoming rival			0
that @entity229 " pivot , " by the way , is shared with the @entity49 administration			0
but overall , @entity5 's foreign policy choices , based on national interest , national values , strategic considerations and popular opinion , will not significantly change regardless of whether @entity49 or @entity2 wins the presidential election			1
@entity2 and @entity3 , if they win , are likely to up @entity5 involvement in the @entity75 conflict , and they may well preside over an @entity5 conflict with @entity74			1
but @entity49 may do just the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity247 .			0

@entity249 : presidents face *unexpected* challenges when it comes to international affairs
@entity255 : it 's hard to find a sharp difference between @entity2 and @entity49 in foreign policy
she says @entity49 and @entity2 disagree about the future @entity225 budget
@entity255 : @entity49 or @entity2 will likely preside over conflict with @entity74 and involvement with @entity75
