@entity0 -- a @entity3 sheriff who just arrested 22 men caught in an online undercover operation blames the policies of the internet sites used by sexual predators			1
the investigation , dubbed @entity10 , conducted by the @entity11 , netted 22 men , including a @entity14 sailor , a software technician with top - secret clearance and a @entity17			1
the sheriff 's office says all the men answered online ads placed by undercover detectives			1
" these men showed up to our undercover location with gifts and clothing for children , along with condoms and sex toys they planned on using when having sex with the children , " said @entity24 sheriff @entity23			1
and while internet sites claim to have security features in place to combat this type of behavior , @entity23 tells @entity1 their security measures are insufficient			1
" i wonder if the ceo of one of these mega-companies would have the same attitude if these people were preying on their own children			1
it 's all about money , " he said			2
the @entity49 works with many of the electronic service providers , including internet providers and photo storage sites			2
the center tells @entity1 that if the internet sites become aware of child pornography or exploitation on their systems , they are required , by federal law , to report it to law enforcement via the cybertip line , which is operated by the center			2
from there , the @entity49 refers the call to the appropriate law enforcement agency			2
" if they become aware of it , they are required to report it , but it does n't require them to take additional steps , " said @entity68 , the vice president of the @entity69 at the @entity49			2
" there 's no requirement for them to monitor or look for child pornography , " she said			0
however , @entity82 said , the technological explosion has made companies more proactive			0
" companies are being challenged to think of new and more creative ways to reduce the victimization of children on their services , " she told @entity1			0
" there 's a lot of progress over the past 10 years ... but much more needs to be done , " she said			0
one of those apprehended in @entity3 was a @entity14 sailor from @entity94 , @entity95 , who allegedly came to an undercover location to teach a woman 's 11 - year - old daughter to have sex in a " coming of age ceremony			1
" another man , from @entity103 , @entity104 , is a software technician with top - secret clearance for a @entity108 government contractor			0
according to the @entity11 , this man allegedly responded to a fictitious ad hoping to have sex with what he thought was a man 's 10 - year - old stepdaughter			1
" we saw men soliciting our undercover detectives to have sex with children within minutes of initiating online chats with them			1
their behavior is despicable , " @entity23 said			0
the operation took place between april 18 and sunday			0
four of the suspects traveled to @entity3 from @entity104 , @entity95 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
one man , an 18 - year - old who allegedly thought he was going to meet a 13 - year - old girl was being handcuffed saturday when he allegedly told detectives , " my mom 's gon na kill me ... and tomorrow 's @entity132			0
" the @entity11 says that after suspects answered their ads , they then continued their dialogue via email , online chats and text messages			0
the suspects agreed to come to @entity24 to an undercover location , when they were arrested			1
@entity23 says their behavior is horrible , but so is that of the companies , which enable predators to hunt down kids			0
" they either do n't care or are in total denial , and that really concerns me , " @entity23 said			0
" it tells me that they have no moral bounds or moral responsibility or are concerned about kids			0
