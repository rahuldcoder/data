@entity0 , @entity1 and some , like my next train stop , which ca n't make up their minds			1
@entity1 , is one of these " undecided " states , which have become crucially important			1
a look back shows @entity18 won eight out of the last 10 presidential elections here , and in an interesting twist , @entity1 also picked the election winner in eight of those 10 elections too			1
the exceptions of course were the @entity27 victories of @entity28 in 1992 and @entity7 in 2008			1
in other words , @entity1 stays @entity18 until it sees a @entity27 it likes , and then that man wins the election			1
with a large percentage of voters who classify themselves as independent , this year @entity1 also has 6 % of the electorate who say they are undecided -- the independents and the undecided will make the difference here			1
@entity40 train : no better way to connect with @entity5 voters behind these numbers is a state with changing demographics , bringing in new voters			1
@entity47 bristles with it , media and healthcare industries , which have shifted parts of the state to the political center			2
there is the rising number of @entity57 voters , who could be crucial if they cast their ballot			2
and , of course , there are the traditional rural , ranching and agricultural communities that remain the stalwarts of the @entity18 backbone			2
so today @entity1 is absolutely split			2
of those who have expressed a preference , roughly 47 % are going for each candidate and the rest are undecided			2
but here is the crucial point			0
undecided does not mean apathetic			2
according to @entity71 , the former publisher of @entity0 's local paper , @entity1 's 6 % undecided will vote ; they just have n't decided for whom			1
when i tweeted this fact at the weekend ( @ richardquest ) there was a barrage of tweets back			0
" how could anyone be undecided this close to the election ? " was a common thread			2
after so much debate and discussion , surely everyone has made up their minds ? not here ! @entity88 's 19th century wisdom for 20th century problem on the @entity91 ranch in @entity0 , i met one political commentator from the right , one from the left and one in the middle			0
and i immediately understood the predicament			0
@entity1 is a frontier state ; hardy , rugged , mountainous , with winters that are not for the faint hearted			1
but it is also a fair state , with a liberal tradition on social issues ( a proposal to legalize marijuana is on the ballot paper this year )			0
in 2008 they liked the idea of change , and gave @entity7 a 9 % victory			1
now that undecided element is in play again and there is confusion about which way it will move			0
according to liberal columnist @entity118 's research , " undecideds " eventually stay with the incumbent			0
better the devil you know			0
her conservative rival columnist @entity123 told me exactly the opposite			0
he quoted research showing " undecideds " ultimately go with the challenger			0
an @entity131 life : @entity5 without sound bites i was none the wiser , until my political pundits had a rare moment of agreement			1
the undecided voters would choose on issues of character , and on how the candidates behaved			0
with no single hot - button issue here , @entity1 will go with the man they feel speaks to their frontier spirit and values			1
which man is that ? ah , there you have me again , and that is because of the economy and the demographics			0
@entity1 is changing and it is simply too close to call			2
what i can say is that we should keep a close watch on this state in the weeks ahead , especially as it bodes for the presidency			0
after all , on the last two occasions that elections saw the state go @entity27 , the party failed to repeat the result four years later			0
in 1992 it did n't matter ; @entity28 won elsewhere			0
in 2012 , @entity7 needs this state to ensure his second term i must return to the train			1
the @entity171 is almost boarding at @entity0			0
it will take me 11 hours to reach @entity10 's safe , solid state : @entity11 , my next stop on this @entity175			1
@entity175 begins in @entity7 country			1

@entity2 's @entity178 is in @entity1 , a state that leans @entity18 but went for @entity7 in 2008
he is in the @entity5 as part of @entity175 , a series on the election airing from *october* *29*
