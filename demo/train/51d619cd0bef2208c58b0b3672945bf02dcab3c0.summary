massive architectural marvels from times past , they are often stopping points on a tourist 's journey			2
although these grand sites are n't always why globe - trotters say they 're going on vacation , some of history 's great works of architecture star in the returning traveler 's photos			2
did you get that smiling shot in front of @entity21 or the photo " pushing " the @entity24 upright ? despite a tight economy , a new generation of architects is giving the traveler reasons to jump on a plane to see modern masterpieces			0
many of the new structures are public projects , designed to welcome the resident and tourist alike			2
" there 's been a lot of emphasis on public architecture , using it to really bring vitality to a place , " says @entity36 , @entity38 's architecture and classical music critic			1
" whether people are traveling a great distance to see one thing or it 's creating a market for the regeneration of a place that really needs it , those things get merged			2
" here are six great spots for ogling modern marvels : @entity56 ( @entity57 )			1
@entity56 , which brought vitality to @entity57 's @entity59 when it moved into the @entity60 many years ago , is having the same impact at its new location nearby			1
the symphony , which prepares graduates of major music schools for roles in leading orchestras around the world , hired architect @entity69 to design its $ 160 million @entity71 campus in collaboration with symphony founder and artistic director @entity73			1
the campus , which hosted its inaugural concert in january 2011 , has an adjacent 2.5 - acre public space designed by @entity79 architecture firm @entity78			1
free and affordable events are often scheduled at the outdoor space			1
for the architecture geek : @entity57 is also attracting the world 's architects to its parking structures			1
noted architect @entity86 was recently selected to design a municipal garage			0
she follows on the heels of @entity71 architect @entity69 , @entity91 architect @entity90 and @entity93 architecture firm @entity92 , all with innovative parking garages in @entity57			1
appearing to be hewn out of the foothills of the @entity101 , the @entity96 of @entity99 's new $ 140 million @entity98 looks like @entity99			1
unlike designers of many natural history museums in urban locations , @entity102 and @entity103 could take advantage of the 17 - acre site 's location at the edge of @entity97			2
the building is above ancient @entity113 's shoreline , with the @entity114 cutting through the site			2
for the architecture geek : tucked away in a @entity97 block behind homes and businesses , @entity117 is one of the city 's best - kept secret treasures			1
dating back to the late 1940s and designed by @entity117 , a contractor and former bishop of the @entity134 , " it 's a funky and relatively obscure public sculpture garden located in @entity97 that has many fans among architects and @entity131 students , " says @entity124 , a local architect and past president of the @entity126			2
@entity135 , the @entity136 and more ( @entity137 )			0
since the banishment of vehicular traffic from parts of @entity135 , the neon and digital people " have gone nuts " with signage in @entity135			0
it creates an almost performance art - like scene for the pedestrians taking a break from their walks , says @entity151 architecture critic @entity150			0
after a walk through @entity135 , head south to an innovative urban park built atop an unused elevated train line in @entity158 's @entity157 neighborhood			2
the @entity136 has been a hit since it opened in phases over the past three years			0
unencumbered by moving vehicles or traffic lights , landscape architect @entity164 and the architecture firm of @entity161 designed a garden oasis above the hustle and bustle of the @entity170			0
for the architecture geek : continue downtown to 8 spruce st. , where @entity137 by @entity69 ( another @entity69 design ) is reportedly the tallest residential structure in the @entity176			0
" it has a rippling stainless steel façade , and it 's near @entity179 , so you can walk across the @entity181 to see it , " @entity150 says			2
" the other side is the @entity184 , which is an absolutely stunning place to be in and from which to look at @entity158			0
" landscape architect @entity187 designed the park			0
after gaining national fame and attention for his work into the 1940s , abstract expressionist artist @entity191 withdrew from the commercial art world and kept most of his work rather than selling it			0
although his work was discussed along with peers such as @entity203 and @entity204 , he shunned the public eye			0
he died in 1980 , and his will stipulated that his estate be given to an @entity209 city that would create a permanent space solely for studying and exhibiting his work			1
@entity189 accepted the challenge ; @entity213 of @entity214 designed the structure , and the @entity190 opened in november			0
the museum houses 94 % of the artist 's known work , most of which has never been on public display before now			2
with a series of skylights designed to bring in natural light to illuminate the collection , " the quality of light in this museum is one of the best i 've ever seen , " @entity150 says			0
for the architecture geek : after visiting the still museum , look beyond the art to appreciate the @entity233 's 2006 addition by noted architect @entity234 , who famously won the @entity236 design competition			0
there is a daily architecture tour at 1 p.m. @entity239 ( @entity240 )			1
part of a redevelopment project to reconnect the cutoff waterfront to the rest of the city , the @entity239 has an incredible amount of public space that allows people to walk up the outside of the structure to its rooftop plaza			1
the building , which houses the @entity253 , was designed by the internationally renowned @entity240 architecture firm @entity254			1
if you 'd like to attend any of the artistic performances , make sure to purchase tickets in advance online			0
for the architecture geek : if you think the outside of the @entity239 would be an excellent skate park , it 's no accident			1
skateboarders were consulted about the exterior design and surfaces and have enjoyed the results , according to @entity268			0
the magazine lists some suggested moves			0
@entity271 ( @entity272 , @entity273 )			1
for the adventurous architecture traveler , try visiting @entity272 , @entity273 , where a renaissance in design and infrastructure is taking place			1

" our most beautiful buildings must be in our poorest areas , " @entity279 has frequently said			0
designed by architect @entity291 of @entity292 , @entity271 , in the @entity272 neighborhood of @entity294 , is the most famous of a half - dozen libraries designed with park space in the city			1
along with improvements in roads and schools , the city has built a system of gondola - like public transit to transport residents of the poorest hillside communities down to the city 's public rail system			1
although @entity272 is much safer than it was during the height of the drug wars , check with local officials and the @entity311 before heading to @entity294			2
the libraries are part of the city 's commitment to its poorest residents			1
" it represents an investment in the whole urban fabric , using culture , architecture and design to improve people 's lives and connect them to transit , architecture and culture , " says @entity36 , the @entity38 critic			0
