@entity0 -- @entity2 does not like to talk about herself			0
i know this because we 've sat down on numerous occasions for interviews , going back to the early days of @entity9 's presidential campaign			1
but this one was perhaps the most challenging because the focus was on her			0
she is fiercely loyal to @entity9 , as one of his closest friends			1
but she also advises him as president , with the title of @entity18 and assistant to the president for @entity20			0
the ultimate insider does not spill the beans			0
but doing a series on the power players inside the @entity25 would not be complete without looking at @entity27 's role			1
she has called her relationship with the president a " mind meld			0
" " we 're good friends who have known each other for a long time , " @entity27 says			1
" eighteen years , you get a pretty good sense of him			2
" her first sense of him came in 1991 when @entity9 was a young law professor in @entity41 , @entity42			1
@entity27 was interviewing his fianc√©e , the future first lady , @entity43 , for a job in @entity41 mayor @entity46 's office			1
the protective partner , @entity9 , was making sure @entity27 was on the up and up			1
@entity27 first explained the scene when i interviewed her in may 2008			1
" they sat next to each other and when she was speaking he would just look at her with this adoring look , " @entity27 said with a laugh , " but he was really tough on me in the nicest possible way			1
" the three became fast friends			0
now @entity9 says he runs every important decision by @entity27 , trusts her completely and considers her family			1
when i bring this to her attention she accepts her role humbly			2
" well , i hope he would trust me the way any close friend does			0
he knows i have his best interest at heart and that i understand , because i 'm part of the administration , the myriad of challenges he faces , " @entity27 says			1
" so i hope he views me a sounding board , someone who 's going to be honest , direct and candid with him at all times			2
" she laughs when i suggest perhaps she is his consigliere			0
" you can tell i 'm uncomfortable with this , " she says when i try to get her to focus more on her role			2
she does not like to be singled out from the rest of the @entity25 team			1
instead she paints a picture of what it would be like if i were in an @entity91 meeting with the president			0
" when everyone 's done talking , if there 've been a couple of people who 've been quiet , he 'll say , ' well , @entity98 , what do you think of this issue ? ' " @entity27 says			1
she describes his style in running the meetings as " accommodating			0
" " he reads people very well			0
he can tell from the body language if someone is uncomfortable with something , " @entity27 says			1
but she can also read the president 's body language when he 's heard enough talk			2
" he 's not moody , but you can tell when he 's ready for a conversation to end , " @entity27 says			1
" he enjoys making sure there is robust debate , but when he 's finished with debate he 's finished			2
he 's ready to move on			2
so i can detect when enough is enough , let 's bring in the next issue			2
" @entity27 says newcomers to the administration have pulled her aside to get her take on how things were going			1
" particularly early on , people who did n't know the president as well as i did would come to me after a meeting and say ' what did he really mean ? i know he said this , but what is he really thinking ? ' and i took such delight in being able to say he meant exactly what he said			0
that 's who he is			2
" it 's the intangibles that @entity27 sometimes brings to the table			1
" people are always looking for the hidden intent , the body language , and he is about as straight a shooter as you 're going to ever come across			0
so i think part of what i do is go around and give people some comfort to really trust what he said			0
he meant exactly what he said			0
you can take him at face value			0
" @entity27 says the president does not make deals after his meetings are done			1
people do n't trail him through the back door trying to change his mind			0
" that 's just not the way he operates , " @entity27 says			1
" he likes to hear from everybody at the same time			0
then he makes a decision			2
" @entity27 's job includes acting as a liaison to the business community and conducting outreach to @entity167 groups			1
but it 's her role as confidante to the president that makes her the ultimate insider			1
@entity27 sits in on @entity9 's daily briefings in the morning that deal with national security and the economy			1
she also attends policy meetings regarding the president 's agenda on health care , energy and education			2
she facilitates and hosts small groups of @entity185 to have lunch with @entity9			1
and she heads the @entity187 as the president 's contact with outside groups			0
@entity27 says she also spends " a good deal of time " with @entity43 both personally and professionally			1
part of her portfolio is working closely with the first lady 's team , " making sure there 's seamless interaction between the @entity199			0
" @entity27 occupies the office previously used by @entity201 and former first lady @entity202			1
she is often the only woman in the room in briefings with the president			0
but she dismisses talk of tension with " the boys , " as some of the male power players are referred to in the @entity25			1
" we really do pull together as a team , " @entity27 says			1
while @entity27 's ability to freelance as the president 's senior adviser has rankled some , @entity27 says being inside the circle of power is a " warm " and " inclusive " environment			1
as for @entity9 's all - male pickup basketball games , @entity27 says that 's not where the real power resides			1
" i think what 's really important is who does the president surround himself with and give substantial responsibilities to			2
" @entity27 's got plenty of responsibility			1
her challenge is separating her friendship with the president from her job			0
often she takes her cues from where she stands			0
" if we 're in the @entity91 , i call him " mr. president			0
" it 's very formal			0
i think it 's appropriate			0
it 's not just deferential to him but to the office , " @entity27 says			1
" i really try to compartmentalize our friendship and what my role is outside the office , and my role as senior adviser			1
" when i ask her if that 's a difficult thing to do , requiring her to flip a switch , she says " no. " she says when she 's in the @entity91 , they 're all about business , outside , " everything but business			2
" " the one thing i do n't do is try to mix the two			0
i do n't try to be his friend when we 're having a business conversation and i try not to burden him with office issues when trying to have downtime , " @entity27 says			1
when they 're hanging out as friends , it 's often indulging in their favorite pastime			0
" we like to eat , " @entity27 says with a hearty laugh			2
" he 's a healthy eater			0
we have a lot of wonderful conversations around the dinner table -- something we 've always enjoyed			0
" but now that dinner table is in the @entity25			2
the movies they enjoy watching , they now take in at the @entity25 movie theater			2
but despite that , @entity27 insists her longtime friend is the same			2
she says what she finds " so appealing " is he 's still " grounded			0
" " he has a very good sense of self , he 's steady			0
his temperament is very predictable , " she says			0
a year after @entity9 captured the @entity25 , @entity27 is still in awe			1
" not a day goes by i do n't pinch myself and treasure this experience and opportunity to serve this president who also happens to be my friend			0

@entity27 has known @entity9 and @entity43 for 18 years
she 's now a senior adviser in the @entity9 @entity25
@entity9 says he runs every important decision by @entity27
she says she tries to keep business role , friendship separate
