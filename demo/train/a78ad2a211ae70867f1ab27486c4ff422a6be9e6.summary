" as it gets closer to the highway , there 's a change in the pitch attitude ( position of the plane ) and it appears the aircraft ( left ) wing stalls , or loses lift			1
that 's what causes the dramatic turn to the left , " @entity104 told @entity1 's " @entity109 with @entity110			0
" " it 's what causes the aircraft to come down more forcefully and crash			2
