-- @entity1 did n't score but , once again , it was still all about him			1
the @entity4 striker made his much anticipated reintroduction into @entity7 soccer sunday when he started for @entity8 against @entity9			1
@entity8 ran out comfortable 3 - 0 winners with goals from @entity12 , @entity13 and new signing @entity14			1
but before , during and after the game , all eyes were on the mercurial @entity1 , who showed flashes of both his brilliance and profligacy			1
on any other day he might have had a hat trick , but he missed his three clear cut chances in the first half			2
@entity24 impressed yet @entity1 's work rate and approach play on and off the ball impressed his new coach @entity24			1
" he is a good man and i think if you take away the circus around him , and the circus he invites himself sometimes , control the background noise and get him focused on his football , he 'll make mistakes ... but he 's going to be a real handful for defenders , " @entity24 said after the game			0
@entity24 also revealed that @entity1 had never defended at a corner before coming to @entity8			1
" for the first time in his life he marked at a corner , " @entity24 revealed			0
international player , won three titles , and we were doing corners and i said , ' are you picking up [ opposition players ] at the corners '			0
he said : ' i do n't mark at corners			2
" it was almost a dream debut for @entity1 but he managed to head the ball straight at @entity53 in the @entity9 goal			1
but @entity24 ' new system , with @entity1 and @entity56 up front and @entity12 playing behind , paid dividends			1
in fact it was @entity12 who broke the deadlock when he scored at the near post following a @entity65 cross from the right hand side			2
a @entity13 penalty and a stunning @entity14 strike made sure of the points and ensured @entity1 's return to @entity7 football was a winning one			1
@entity74 stutter later in the day @entity74 continued their indifferent @entity76 form with a 1 - 1 draw against @entity78			2
with the transfer window about to shut , @entity74 's depth of forward options had been under scrutiny before the game			0
but it was one of coach @entity87 's big summer signings , @entity85 , who put @entity74 ahead before @entity78 equalized through a @entity89 header			0
@entity74 had 24 chances during the match but could n't break down a team who were promoted from @entity7 soccer 's second tier last season			2
" tough , tough , " @entity87 told @entity97 after the draw			0
" a draw was fair			0
we did n't play well enough			2
we lacked a bit of creativity			0
we 've had two tough weeks , three away games			0
it is not an excuse , but we are a bit jaded			0
in the end we could have lost it			0
