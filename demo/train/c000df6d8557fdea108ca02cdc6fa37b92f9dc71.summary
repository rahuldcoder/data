-- a middle - aged woman walked into the emergency room of @entity3 with a fever on the evening of june 23			1
@entity5 was known as one of the best hospitals in rural @entity8 , supported by the local government and international religious and academic partners			1
@entity5 was especially known for its high - quality nursing care , serving as a training hospital for nearby @entity14 , one of the country 's few nursing schools			1
a few hours after arriving in the emergency room , the woman was admitted to the medicine ward with a list of potential infections -- all the usual suspects in @entity24 : malaria , typhoid , sepsis			1
an epidemic had been raging for months in nearby @entity29 , but @entity30 was not considered as a possible diagnosis			1
after all , nobody at @entity5 had ever seen a patient before with @entity30 , and as the axiom goes in medicine , when you hear hoof beats , think horses , not zebras			1
certainly do n't start imagining unicorns			0
the nurse who cared for the woman that night drew her blood and helped her to the toilet to urinate			0
when the woman began vomiting and soiled her sheets , the nurse cleaned up the mess , as nurses do all over the world every day			0
for a disease whose transmission depends on the direct contact of one human being with the body fluids of another , @entity30 has no better customer than nurses			1
the other thing about nurses that the virus finds particularly helpful is they tend to work in shifts			0
before the week was out , @entity24 's first @entity30 patient had died , and seven nurses caring for her had fallen ill. six of them would also die in the coming weeks			1
the remaining clinical staff , watching their colleagues falling ill all around them , abandoned the hospital			1
when the patients saw what was happening , those well enough to walk out did just that			0
over the ensuing months , the epidemic rippled across @entity24			1
hundreds of individuals were infected , and perhaps more importantly , basic social institutions also began to collapse			1
one by one , all three hospitals in the county shut down due to fear of the spread of the virus , followed by most of the primary care clinics			1
women were left without midwives to deliver their babies , accident victims without emergency rooms to care with them			0
next the primary schools closed , then the secondary schools , and finally @entity14			2
guilty of @entity30 until proven otherwise @entity30 is not just a disease of individuals but also one that infects society 's most basic health and social welfare structures			1
as a disease that afflicts health care institutions , it is perhaps fitting that the most powerful weapon in the fight against @entity30 is not a single drug or vaccine but instead a particular type of health care institution : the @entity104 , or @entity105			1
on september 15 , i helped @entity107 open the first @entity105 in @entity24			1
i have worked in many hospitals , both rich and poor , and have set up refugee camp clinics and trauma field hospitals in poverty - stricken and war - torn countries			2
but managing an @entity105 has been an entirely different experience			0
the primary goal of a hospital or clinic is to care for patients and , if possible , to save their lives			0
the primary goal of an @entity105 is to protect the lives of its staff			2
the secondary goal is to protect surrounding communities and resuscitate local health care systems by taking patients suspected of having @entity30 out of their homes and hospital emergency rooms , breaking the chain of transmission			1
caring for patients comes third on the list of priorities , though still remains important			0
after all , why would people go to an @entity105 if they did not think there was at least a chance that it would help make them better ? during the week before opening our @entity105 , i can honestly say that i worked harder and slept less than during any other time in my life			0
the sheer number of details involved in the construction and management of this unique type of health care facility is almost endless			0
@entity30 's $ 1 billion bill hits @entity149 's bright economic lights first , a site had to be chosen , which has been a significant roadblock to the opening of other @entity154			1
hospitals tend to be built close to the communities they serve ; most communities , however , tend to want their @entity105 as far away as possible			2
our @entity105 sits in the middle of a forest , 2 kilometers ( more than a mile ) down a rough dirt road , on the grounds of an old leper colony			0
perhaps it is not surprising that the survivors of one of humanity 's oldest and most stigmatized diseases would be among the few to welcome a treatment facility for one of the newest stigmatized diseases			0
second , the design and infrastructure of the @entity105 had to be perfected , with separate spaces and wards designating different levels of risk , where staff members would know to take different kinds of precautions			2
a borehole was drilled and giant tanks erected to mix up the nearly 12,000 liters of chlorine required each day to disinfect the @entity105 and its staff properly			2
a giant incinerator was built to burn the vast amounts of infected waste produced by the facility safely			2
third , supplies had to be purchased , both the normal kind present in any hospital , such as bed sheets and intravenous fluids , but also the expensive ( and increasingly difficult to purchase ) personal protective equipment			0
a single outfit of boots , gloves , suit , mask , hood , goggles and apron costs as much as $ 90 , and at full capacity the @entity105 might go through 100 outfits a day			0
ebola hospital overwhelmed by patients finally and most importantly , local staff had to be hired and trained to work in the facility			2
while a small team of expatriates working with @entity107 manages our @entity105 , more than 90 % of the staffing remains local			0
during the week before opening our facility , i helped organize an intensive training for our first 50 staff members , including physician assistants , nurses , nursing aids , hygienists , sprayers , safety monitors , waste handlers , chlorinators , laundry staff and burial team members , to ensure they knew how to protect their health and the health of their colleagues while working in the @entity105			2
just 72 hours before our opening day , we had a checklist of almost 50 items , ranging from goggles to gravediggers , that we still needed to be able to begin admitting patients safely to the @entity105			0
the pressure to open the @entity105 had been building for weeks as the numbers of cases of @entity30 in the county began to skyrocket			1
somehow , and i 'm still not sure how , we made it happen .			0

@entity3 in rural @entity8 was abandoned after first @entity30 patient infected staff
all three hospitals and schools in @entity24 shut down due to fear of @entity30
