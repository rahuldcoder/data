-- what 's at stake in the conflict between the @entity5 and @entity6 over @entity7 is not just the future of @entity9 , it 's the future of international order			1
some weeks ago , @entity9 was a remote place , to historians known as the center of a war in the 1850s , while ordinary people would have associated it with some kind of sparkling alcoholic beverage			2
but suddenly and unexpectedly , @entity9 has become a geopolitical hotspot in a conflict between @entity6 and the @entity5 that seems to be straight out of a @entity22 playbook			1
@entity23 has raised the stakes dramatically with a de facto annexation of this region , which is home of an important @entity6 naval base and inhabited by a population whose majority is oriented towards @entity6 ( while an important minority , among them the @entity34 , is strongly attached to @entity7 )			1
it is unclear at the moment whether president @entity37 sees this only as a first step , which may be followed by an invasion of other parts of southern and eastern @entity7			1
what is clear is that @entity6 is not going to leave anytime soon			0
' @entity44 lite ' the tactics and strategies of de facto - annexation have already been displayed in the @entity49 regions @entity51 and @entity52 after the @entity6 - @entity49 war in 2008 ; we 're likely to see them now in @entity9			1
under the cover of sham legality , the region will in essence be fully controlled by @entity23			0
the current leadership in the @entity60 has never accepted that @entity7 , which achieved independence in 1991 , is a sovereign state			2
it considers @entity7 to be in its sphere of influence , which means that on important issues the country must -- in @entity6 's view -- ask @entity23 for permission			1
@entity37 's broader plan is to recreate some kind of " @entity44 lite , " a ring of countries under @entity23 's control , with the goal of boosting @entity6 's geopolitical standing			1
@entity7 is the cornerstone of that project			2
the downfall of president @entity80 and the triumph of the popular @entity83 movement in @entity7 have signaled to @entity23 , however , that it is losing its grip on @entity7 and that its grand strategy is going nowhere			1
as the new government in @entity87 appears committed to a close association with the @entity89 and as @entity37 had lost indirect means of control , he decided to use armed force to win @entity7 back -- or at least to deny the @entity5 what he sees , in his terms , as the @entity5 's victory			1
@entity23 has been consistent in viewing @entity7 as a satellite country but the @entity5 has constantly ignored the risk that @entity6 could use armed force there			1
yes , there was the precedent of the war in @entity49 , but back then @entity23 had at least some arguments to back up its narrative of a humanitarian intervention , while the @entity49 side lost its nerve and acted preemptively			0
and the @entity108 and the @entity89 were all too happy to accept @entity23 's version of events and continue to do business as usual			1
the @entity7 situation is different in many regards			0
first , there were no serious ethnic tensions that could serve as a pretext for @entity6 intervention			0
second , @entity7 lies between the @entity89 and @entity6 , which means that the @entity5 simply can not ignore a @entity6 aggression because of geographic proximity			1
thirdly , the @entity89 is already deeply involved in @entity7			0
in the case of @entity7 , the @entity5 is not going to accept @entity23 's narrative			1
this is too obviously a case of aggression -- the use of force violating @entity7 's sovereignty			1
but @entity37 must have calculated that nevertheless the price for challenging the @entity5 over @entity7 wo n't be too high -- that the @entity5 is not going to unite behind a strong response			1
@entity5 cracks is he right ? signs of disagreement about the proper response are visible			0
on sunday , @entity134 foreign minister @entity133 publicly voiced doubts about the proposal to exclude @entity6 from the @entity137			0
@entity139 's tactic is to continue to act as if @entity6 were ultimately a constructive partner , which just has to be brought back to its senses through intense dialogue			2
while @entity139 wants to offer carrots to bring @entity23 back on the path of virtue , others think the time for sticks has come			0
@entity149 is preparing measures to step up economic pressure			0
but inside the @entity89 there is no unity about the proper reaction			0
the @entity5 is far from a united stand and a forceful response			0
worse , instead of keeping their differences behind closed doors , @entity5 cracks are all too visible , emboldening @entity37			2
it 's safe to assume that the @entity5 reaction is shaping @entity37 's course of action			1
@entity23 fears isolation and economic retaliation			0
the money that permits the @entity6 leadership to pursue costly and risky foreign policy adventures comes in large part from the @entity89 , as payment for gas and oil			0
and substantial parts of the investments of the @entity6 elite are in the @entity89 as well			0
but it does n't look as if the @entity5 is using its leverage			0
it may incentivize @entity37 to go beyond the de facto - annexation of @entity9 and try to split larger parts away from @entity7			1
@entity5 policymakers should raise their game and understand what is at stake			2
if @entity6 goes beyond @entity9 , there is the risk of a major war with @entity7			1
no government can simply watch as another country invades its territory			0
acting like an empire beyond @entity7 , this conflict is also a defining moment for future @entity6 foreign policy			1
if @entity23 succeeds in @entity7 , it will come to the conclusion that it can act like an empire			2
an empire has no borders and does n't respect the borders of others			0
@entity23 's pretext of protecting allegedly threatened @entity6 passport - holders could be used against many countries			1
if the operation in @entity7 succeeds , it will scare many neighboring countries and prompt them to try to buy off @entity6			2
safe borders and sovereignty are core principles of the global order , enshrined in the @entity213 charter and in other documents -- many of which @entity6 has signed			2
@entity6 is a stakeholder in this system , its @entity218 seat is an important element in ensuring its standing as a great power			0
it is also in @entity6 's interests to insist on the sanctity of borders as it has itself a stronger neighbor on its south - eastern side -- @entity230			1
@entity23 can not put the sovereignty of others into question without risking its own sovereignty			2
power vacuum what is at stake in @entity7 is broader than just the region			2
if the @entity89 and @entity108 accept @entity6 's land grab , they weaken the foundations of today 's international order , born out of the ashes of @entity244 and enshrined in the @entity213 charter			1
a situation where powerful states set conditions according to their own interests and weaker ones have no choice but to accept is precisely what this charter is aimed at preventing			0
if one state can invade another without being attacked , without having an international mandate and a clear backing by international norms ( such as the responsibility to protect ) , the foundations of today 's international order will be at risk			0
in the past , it was the @entity108 that promoted and guaranteed the @entity213 - order			0
in the role of a global quasi-sovereign , and faced with major threats , it sometimes violated this principle itself			0
but these were exceptions to the overall beneficial role the @entity108 played in the promotion of a liberal democratic order			0
nowadays , however , @entity149 is diminishing its global footprint , with its taxpayers no longer willing to bear the biggest chunk of the burden to uphold world order			2
the @entity60 has sensed a power vacuum and is stepping in			0
now the @entity5 must decide whether to accept the new rules @entity6 is setting in its neighborhood -- or whether it has the power and strength to defend an order which has brought it decades of freedom , security and prosperity			1

what 's at stake in @entity7 is not just @entity9 's future , but the world order , @entity291 says
he says @entity23 has never accepted @entity7 's sovereignty and considers it in its sphere
@entity37 's broader plan is to create a " @entity44 lite " with @entity7 the cornerstone , he says
@entity291 says the @entity5 must now decide whether to accept @entity6 's rules
