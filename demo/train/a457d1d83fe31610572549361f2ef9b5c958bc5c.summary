-- the biggest production on tv of one of the biggest stories in fantasy is about to get a little , well , bigger			0
the " @entity7 " team is creating a " super-sized " third season of the hit series			1

there 's still 10 , but you 'll get a little more each week than previous seasons			1
@entity0 : ' @entity7 ' casts ' @entity27 ' actor as @entity29 " there 's almost another full episode 's worth of extra minutes spread across the season , " @entity13 says			1
" one of the great liberties with @entity36 is we 're not forced to come in at a specific time			0
we ca n't be under 50 minutes or over 60 , but that gives us a lot of flexibility			0
" it will be " a super-sized season , as befitting ' @entity19 , ' " @entity11 adds			1
" last year we had a lot of 52 - minute episodes			2
this year is a lot of 56 , 57			0
