-- a forlorn and frightened pygmy elephant calf , reaching out its trunk to touch its dead mother			2
that 's the heartbreaking scene local authorities came across recently as they patrolled the @entity6 in northeastern @entity7			0
the mother was one of 14 elephants , the latest one discovered thursday , found dead over the past few weeks in the forest reserve			1
officials believe they were poisoned , though the cause of death is still being determined			1
" poisoning elephants is a very common practice in these parts of the world , " said @entity14 , the @entity17 's @entity16 species expert			1
" the elephants are usually poisoned with bait such as pineapple , palm oil or bananas			1
the poison is fast - acting and can kill up to a whole herd			0
" the purpose of poisoning the elephants : to make the land safe for farming			1
" this is a very sad day for conservation and @entity38 , " said @entity34 's environment and tourism minister , @entity35 , in a news release			1
@entity38 , one of 13 @entity34 states , is home to @entity41 and the remaining pygmy elephants			1
" the death of these majestic and severely endangered @entity7 elephants is a great loss to the state			0
" approximately 1,200 of the endangered pygmy elephants remain in the wild , @entity14 said			0
the elephants like low - lying , open areas in @entity38 where they can feed easily , but they have also been known to roam into plantations and villages where they cause damage and losses to farmers and villagers alike			0
@entity35 said he has directed the @entity59 , which is in charge of the @entity6 , to set up a joint task force with entities such as the @entity63 , the forestry group @entity65 , the @entity17 and police to investigate these deaths			2
" if indeed these poor elephants were maliciously poisoned , i will make sure that the culprits are brought to justice and pay for their crime , " he said in the news release			1
the @entity17 , in a separate statement , said it " is providing support to the @entity59 and is part of the special task force that has been set up by the department to further investigate the matter			2
" " our patrolling teams worked closely with the department in unearthing the incident , " @entity17 - @entity34 's executive director , @entity79 , said in the statement			1
" the central forest landscape in @entity38 needs to be protected totally from conversions " from forest to farmland , he said			0
" all conversion approvals need to be reviewed by the @entity89 and assessed not purely from commercial but the endangered species and landscape ecology perspectives			0
" conversions result in fragmentation of the forests , which in turn results in loss of natural habitat for elephant herds , thus forcing them to find alternative food and space , putting humans and wildlife in direct conflict			0
" holistic , long - term solutions need to be put in place to address and mitigate the problem , @entity79 said			0
while the cause of the elephants ' deaths is being investigated , the future of the little calf found by his mother 's side is uncertain			2
the calf , now named @entity118 , is said to be in the care of the @entity59 , but officials hope to have him rejoin a herd as soon as possible .			0
