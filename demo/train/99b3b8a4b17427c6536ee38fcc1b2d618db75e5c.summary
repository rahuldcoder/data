@entity0 -- as the @entity3 movement grew and touched even more @entity5 cities saturday , the mayor of the city where it began blasted many involved and claimed they were targeting the nation 's financial sector and " trying to destroy the jobs of working people " in @entity0			1
the protest effort continued into its 22nd day in @entity0 on saturday			1
yet its spread well beyond that city , with its anti-corporation , anti-government message echoing in many places this weekend -- from @entity18 to @entity19 , from @entity20 to @entity21 , @entity22			0
@entity23 : see @entity24 from the protests			2
yet this growing fervor has been met , in some cases , by vocal commentary			0
that includes @entity0 mayor @entity30 , who in a @entity32 radio appearance friday said that city 's labor unions -- many of whom swelled demonstrator ranks earlier this week -- depend on salaries that " come from the taxes paid by the people they 're trying to vilify			1
" the mayor did describe the city 's unemployment rate as " unacceptably high , " and acknowledged that " a lot of people are disaffected			1
" " some are legit , some are n't , " @entity30 said , describing the concerns of the demonstrators in @entity49			1
his comments coincided with the city 's announcement that 700 education workers will be laid off in an effort to close a budget gap			2
they also follow recently released census data that shows @entity0 's poverty level has increased to 20.1 % , the highest in more than a decade			1
the remarks drew criticism from @entity63 , a spokesman for @entity3 , who claimed @entity65 " has n't really represented all of @entity0			1
" " the fact is there are thousands and thousands of us out on the streets , and he 's not really recognizing that we 're a movement , " @entity63 told @entity1 on saturday			1
" we should be heard by @entity0 politicians			1
" on saturday , @entity0 protesters set up a second base at @entity76			1
the park in @entity78 is about two miles north of @entity79 , a private park that 's been considered the main rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in the city			2
a rally was held in @entity76 , followed by a now - customary people 's assembly to discuss the movement and an art show saturday evening			1
demonstrators wo n't stay overnight at @entity76 , unlike @entity79 , because it is a municipal park with a midnight curfew			2
as of 9 p.m. , the @entity90 did not report any related arrests			1
the ambiguously defined movement against corporate greed and other social ills has spread to more than a dozen cities , spurred lately by support from unions and other groups			0
" @entity103 and economic inequalities are the tipping point , and people are hungry for getting involved and trying to do something to change it , " @entity99 , who has been involved in @entity101 protests , told @entity1 on saturday			1
" it 's almost like , i want the @entity5 dream back			2
" even before @entity30 's comments saturday , the effort was stirring a growing number of strong reactions from public figures			1
president @entity114 , even as he defended the need for a vibrant financial sector , acknowledged that the protesters " are giving voice to a more broad - based frustration about how our financial system works			2
" the no. 2 @entity123 in the @entity5 @entity124 , @entity125 , meanwhile , slammed what he called the " growing mobs " who he claimed were " pitting ... americans against @entity5			0
" on saturday , @entity5 rep. @entity130 backed the demonstrators -- whom he has been visiting regularly over the past three weeks -- for venting their frustrations and exercising their constitutional rights			0
" their dreams are being shattered , " @entity130 told @entity1 's @entity134			0
" they may be an inconvenience to a whole lot of people in that area , but people are going to sleep at night with an economic nightmare			0
" the @entity0 @entity143 urged " more spiritual leaders " to join a movement he claimed championed the poor and disadvantaged , saying " there 's no moral reason why they have to wait for something to catch on			1
" he also dismissed criticism that the demonstrators do n't have a coherent purpose , saying despite their varied issues and lack of organization , their sentiments are raw and real			0
" they do n't have to know what the solution is , " he said			0
" there 's one thing they know is ( there 's ) something wrong when so many people are out of work , and we find the disparity with the very rich			0
" @entity63 , the @entity0 spokesman , said the movement chiefly is trying to showcase " active democracy and ( show that ) everyone has a voice in government			1
" he said the protests -- which have been associated with progressive causes -- are " a rebuke of government , that includes the left and the right			0
" " we 're trying to broaden the discussion base			0
... we 're trying to represent 99 % of the country that 's felt disenfranchised over the past five years because of the recession , " @entity63 said			0
" ( @entity186 ) have not come together , they 've not compromised on anything , and there 's a reason why there 's ( low ) congressional approval in this country			0
" the demonstrations have been largely peaceful			0
but in @entity0 , some have been marred by scuffles with police			2
last saturday , police made hundreds of arrests as demonstrators marched without a permit toward the @entity201 , blocking city traffic for hours			2
a week earlier , authorities detained dozens of protesters as they marched , also without a permit , through @entity49 's financial district toward @entity207			0
@entity1 's @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
