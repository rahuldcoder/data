-- finery and high fashion have long been synonymous with the @entity4 race meeting , and this year patrons are being scrutinized to a level which is almost unparalleled in the world of sport			1
@entity4 takes fashion so seriously there are even dress code administrators on hand to assess the thousands of people who descend upon the @entity14 venue , with a strict list of dos and don'ts issued to prevent standards slipping			1
the @entity19 , where @entity20 watches all five days of the meeting , is where the most stringent regulations are enforced -- including a ban on the ever - popular fascinator			2
no fairytale ending for @entity20 and @entity27 to ensure fashion decorum , @entity4 's organizers have gone as far as to publish style guides for race goers who will be mingling with @entity33 high society at one of the social calendar 's most prestigious events			1
with all eyes fixed on female visitors during thursday 's @entity41 , the women 's checklist for the @entity19 is detailed			1
all dresses must be of " modest " length -- defined as " falling just above the knee or longer			0
" shorts are a no - no , as are shoulderless dresses			0
women are permitted to wear pants , providing the color and material of them matches what is on display above the waistline			0
the dress code administrators will also be on hand to offer pashminas to any woman who may have misunderstood the regulations			1
if you are belly dancer it is probably best to give @entity4 a wide berth as midriffs must be covered at all times			2
and if you like to attend sporting events in fancy dress forget it -- pantomime horses are banned			2
for the gentlemen who enter @entity4 's inner sanctum , black or gray morning wear is de rigueur -- shoes , a waistcoat and tie and , of course , a top hat			1
in the more relaxed grandstand , a suit will ease you past the fashion police			0
however , if you thought dusting off your cravat for a day at the races was acceptable think again -- such neckwear is strictly verboten			0
@entity84 cruises to @entity4 success " horse racing 's roots as the ' sport of kings ' obviously suggest a pleasure pastime for the elite , " @entity86 , the fashion course director at @entity89 's @entity88 , told @entity0			1
" in the past this would have been , depending on the monarch , an opportunity for either ostentatious displays or relatively tasteful , yet expensive , modesty			0
" the code would denote respect for the monarchy , particularly when they were actually present			2
" the dress code also helps to define the class superiority of the crowd and keep out the great unwashed			1
" any prestigious occasion will have a code to reflect the status of the racegoers regardless of which country it is held , " said @entity86			2
" all codes are aimed at excluding someone			0
our dress is a key signifier of class or our clan , very much so in the @entity33			0
" @entity86 also argued @entity4 's 2012 dress code could be a not - so - subtle hint aimed at encouraging certain punters to cover up			1
" i do n't think that the wish here is to exclude them but to oblige them to cover up by setting strict parameters , " he said			0
" however the fun of strict rules is seeing how far you can bend them -- anyone who ever wore a school uniform can tell you that ! "			0
