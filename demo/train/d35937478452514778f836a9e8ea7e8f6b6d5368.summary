-- it was n't easy for @entity2 to make ends meet as a single father of four on a construction worker 's salary after his first divorce			1
but he did his best to cook dinner each night and to spend quality time with his kids on weekends , and somehow , " they ended up smarter than me , " he jokes			0
fast forward a few decades and @entity14 , now 63 , is raising another family			0
he still makes dinner most nights but now he has a bigger home , a stable job and a wife whose additional income makes things much easier			0
some people cautioned him against remarrying at 49 , saying he was too old to start a new family			0
he had two complicated marriages behind him when his now - wife @entity26 -- his son 's coworker -- agreed to a date			1
he was 48 and dating for the first time since his children left the home ; she was 29 and had just ended what she described as an emotionally abusive marriage to her first husband , with whom she had a daughter			2
she resisted at first because of the age difference , but when she finally gave in they immediately hit it off during their first date at @entity42			0
now , 13 years and one child later , @entity2 and @entity26 say they 're happier than they ever were in their previous marriages			1
they know what they want from the relationship and from each other			2
@entity53 friendship is medicine for the soul " in your first marriage , you 're starting out and struggling , " said @entity2 , now a construction supervisor who lives north of @entity56			1
" it 's a lot easier to raise kids when you have money to raise them and give them the things they want			2
" it 's been a long road to happiness			2
@entity2 was married to the mother of his children and another woman after that , but both relationships ended in divorce			1
with this his third marriage and @entity26 's second , in some ways the couple is beating the odds			1
a 2009 study found that , because boomers divorce and remarry in such large numbers , it is more likely that later - in - life remarriages will end in divorce			1
but the @entity85 and others say lessons learned from past marriages can help nurture future relationships			1
" we 're just so grateful to have a good marriage this time that there 's nothing to really fight over , " @entity90 said			1
" we rarely argue and i think it 's because we get along so well			2
" they also draw upon @entity2 's experience raising children			1
" all the tricks the kids try to pull , if they try to lie or pull the wool over our eyes , he already knows and he knows what to do , " she said			0
second marriages often fail because individuals do n't take the time to figure out what went wrong in the first union or acknowledge their role in the unhappy marriage , said psychotherapist and relationship specialist @entity112 , who has a private practice in @entity115			1
" everyone likes to blame the other person and say he did this or he was too controlling , but were you so passive that you let it continue ? " she said			0
" what were you so fearful of that you lost your voice for so many years ? " dating after 50 for some women , being on their own after years of financial dependency causes them to rush into relationships without considering whether the person is right for them , she said			1
the more you know yourself , your wants and your needs , the healthier your decisions will be if you 're 18 or 55			0
" relationships are about enhancing your life rather than giving you a life , " she said			1
as divorces rates among couples over 50 have doubled in the last 20 years , many are remarrying and starting new families			2
in 1980 , 19 % of married people ages 50 and older were in remarriages compared with 30 % in 2009 , according to a study by the @entity146			2
not everyone is looking for marriage , but the desire for love and companionship is still alive and well , said @entity152 , psychologist and relationship expert at @entity154 , a dating website for the 50 - and - over crowd			1
but for those who have done a bit of soul - searching , the approach to finding a new mate often is more refined			0
" baby boomers are more settled in their behaviors and patterns of life			1
they are concerned about whether it is worth changing ... to allow someone new into their life , " she said			2
" and , the majority of baby boomers are more focused on compatibility , and finding someone who makes them happy , than they were when they were younger			1
" boomers who spoke with @entity152 for her forthcoming book , " finding @entity180 : 6 simple steps to a @entity115 and @entity184 , " had three major takeaways from unsuccessful marriages , she said			1
the first is that communication is key , and not just " maintenance communication			0
" " you ca n't only talk about work , family , who does what around the house or your relationship			2
to communicate well , partners need to reveal more about themselves			0
" on turning 40 second , make sure you partner knows that he or she is important to you			0
" life gets busy and stressed and it is important that your spouse knows you do n't take them for granted			2
give them frequent affirmation , though simple gestures ( hug , kiss , turn on the coffee pot in the morning , bring in the newspaper ) and words ( thank you , you are the best partner , you look so beautiful today )			0
" and last but not least , talk about money , early and often , she said			0
fifty percent of the divorced singles in her study said that they fought so much about money in their first marriage that they anticipated money will be a problem in their next relationship			1
" divorced singles said they have learned that they would discuss money with their partner early on and more often , so that it is n't such an issue			2
they would devise a plan they both could live with , " she said			0
@entity2 and @entity90 both had jobs when they started dating and still do , which helps them maintain a comfortable lifestyle with some money left over for a vacation each year			1
they were also able to buy a car for @entity26 's daughter and help her with living expenses while she 's in college , something @entity2 was unable to do for his first four children			1
" my older kids might be a little resentful of the younger kids because they can see that they have an easier life , " he said			2
" but i gave them the best years of my life			1
if they wanted to go to college , they could , and now they 're all happily married or own homes and have good jobs			2
they 're successful in life			2
" in order to maintain their lifestyle , he estimates he 'll be working for at least another 10 years until their youngest goes to college			0
but , that 's ok , he said			0
" i hate being bored			0
" when it comes to a blended family , they have it all : adult children from previous marriages and grandchildren who are older than their 13 - year - old daughter			1
plus , they 've had custody of @entity26 's 7 - year - old nephew since he was an infant			0
the staggered ages and familial ties are confusing to outsiders , but everyone gets along , he said			0
his grandchildren play with his children younger as if they were cousins			0
when @entity2 's grandson was in the same school as his daughter , he got a kick out of telling everyone she was his aunt , he said			1
the do 's and don'ts of dating after 50 it was n't much of a stretch for @entity2 's adult children to adjust to @entity26 , especially since his oldest son set them up , the couple said			1
early on , @entity26 's family and daughter approved of him despite the age difference because he treated her so well , she said			0
" they said he was the best thing that ever happened to me , " she said			0
" i saw how he raised his kids and doted on them , so i knew he would be a good father			0
" the @entity297 have also dealt with medical problems , a common issue for couples marrying late in life			0
two weeks after the birth of their daughter , @entity2 had prostate surgery after being diagnosed with cancer a month before the baby 's due date			1
years later , he has it under control as a result of the couple 's combined efforts to stay on top of appointments and medications , @entity26 said			1
otherwise , @entity26 no longer feels the age difference as much as she used to , she said			0
@entity2 has slowed down a bit , but so has she			1
their 7 - year - old nephew seems to notice , asking how old @entity2 will be when the boy reaches his age			1
" he tells him , ' i 'm going to live until i 'm 100 ; do n't you worry , ' " she said			0
@entity2 also thinks about it sometimes -- when @entity26 is 60 , he 'll be 80			1
" though we have a really good life right now , that 's the only thing i kind of worry about , " he said			2
" that 's time to come , but so far it 's been great			0
age has n't really caught up to us			0
