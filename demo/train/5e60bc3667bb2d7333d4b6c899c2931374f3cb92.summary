@entity0 -- gov. @entity2 , who has long avoided wading into the immigration debate , said thursday in @entity4 that he wo n't lay out his position on immigration reform unless he decides to run for president			1
" until that time i have no role in the immigration debate , except for how it may affect the individual citizens of @entity9 , which i 'll deal with as governor , " the @entity9 @entity8 told reporters			1
" but i wo n't have anything to say on immigration unless and until i become a candidate for president of the @entity22 , " he continued			2
" if that happens , then i will articulate a full position on it			1
" third of @entity28 would migrate to the @entity22 , survey finds his comments came on the second of a three - day trip to @entity4 , where the governor is meeting with @entity28 dignitaries and business leaders to build economic and education partnerships			1
while @entity2 has repeatedly criticized president @entity37 for his handling of security enforcement at the @entity22 - @entity4 border , the governor has yet to detail his own position on legislation reform			1
" i know you guys are begging to have me focus on immigration , and let me put you to rest : i 'm not going to , " he said , referring to the news media			0
" you can ask in 18 different ways ... i 'm not giving you the story , so you can move on to whatever your next questions are			0
" @entity8 ignoring their own advice on immigration during a trip to @entity54 in july -- at the height of the crisis involving children crossing the border illegally -- @entity2 declined to answer questions from reporters about immigration			2
" i 'm not going to discuss a complicated issue like immigration in a parking lot here in @entity71 , which really deserves a much deeper and more thoughtful conversation than we give out here right now , " he said at the time , faulting " both parties " for the way they 've handled the issue			2
@entity2 : @entity9 may consider housing kids from southern border influx in june , while the governor was in @entity78 , he refused to lay out his position , again saying his current location was not the appropriate venue for such a topic			1
" i 'm sure you 'd love me to do that , " he said with sarcasm , after a reporter asked him to spell out his stance			0
" and in fact what i want to do in a flower warehouse , i want to give you a very complex answer behind a set of microphones on a contentious issue that 's driving debate all across the country			0
" on thursday , @entity2 said he discussed immigration issues the day prior in a meeting with @entity28 president @entity100 , saying they talked about how " it 's a very difficult issue for both parties " in the @entity22 and how it 's @entity0 's responsibility to fix the problem			1

asked by one reporter about the importance of @entity109 voters for republicans at the national level , @entity2 acknowledged the electoral advantages			0
" the importance of it is the more votes you get , the more chance you have to win , " he said bluntly			0
" and i do n't care who those votes come from , as long as you wind up with more than the other guy , you win , you get to govern , and that 's what our party should be focused on			0
