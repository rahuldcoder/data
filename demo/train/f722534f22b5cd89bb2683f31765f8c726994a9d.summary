@entity0 -- the chief executive officer of @entity3 resigned wednesday after a series of controversies at the public broadcaster formerly known as @entity3			1
a statement posted on the @entity3 website by board chairman @entity9 said the organization 's board of directors accepted @entity13 's resignation " with understanding , genuine regret and great respect for her leadership of @entity3 these past two years			1
" @entity13 's resignation came a day after @entity20 , @entity3 's former senior vice president for fundraising , was shown in an undercover video calling the @entity22 " racist " and " scary " and questioning whether @entity3 needs federal funding			1
@entity20 , who is not related to @entity13 , issued an apology tuesday night and said his already - announced resignation would be effective immediately			1
in his statement to @entity3 employees , @entity9 said he recognizes " the magnitude of this news -- and that it comes on top of what has been a traumatic period for @entity3 and the larger public radio community			2
the board is committed to supporting @entity3 through this interim period and has confidence in @entity3 's leadership team			1
" @entity39 , @entity3 's senior vice president of legal affairs and general counsel , was appointed as interim ceo under a succession plan the board adopted in 2009 , @entity9 ' statement said			1
the board will establish a committee " that will develop a timeframe and process for the recruitment and selection of new leadership , " he said			0
@entity9 credited @entity13 with bringing " vision and energy " to @entity3 and leading it back from " the enormous economic challenges of the previous two years			1
she was passionately committed to @entity3 's mission and to stations and @entity3 working collaboratively as a local - national news network			1
" @entity3 spokeswoman @entity57 said she could not confirm reports that @entity13 was forced out			1
filmmaker @entity59 said tuesday the video featuring @entity20 was part of a sting operation			2
he said the idea stemmed from an incident in october when @entity3 fired analyst @entity65 after @entity65 said he gets worried when he sees people wearing @entity68 garb on airplanes			2
" my colleague @entity71 who posed as one of the members of the @entity74 was pretty offended with what happened with @entity65 and he suggested looking into @entity3 after that incident back in the fall , " @entity59 told @entity1 's @entity70 on tuesday			1
" my other colleague , @entity77 , came up with the idea to have a @entity68 angle since @entity65 was fired due to his comments			0
so we decided to see if there was a greater truth or hidden truth amongst these reporters and journalists and executives			0
" @entity65 has since been hired full - time by @entity88			0
his firing by @entity3 prompted criticism by conservative politicians who raised questions about government funding for the public broadcaster			1
in an interview with @entity1 scheduled for broadcast wednesday night on " @entity99 , " radio show host @entity95 said the criticism of @entity3 by conservatives is politically motivated			1
" i think that what 's happening here is that not only are they looking at the budget but they 're looking at a way to silence public broadcasting , " said @entity95 , whose show is broadcast on @entity3 outlets across the country			2
she rejected calls to cut off funding for @entity3 , saying the public broadcaster was established " to entitle people across the country to get a wide range of views and that 's what it 's done			1
why should n't we keep on doing that ? if public funding goes , the system out there is going to suffer			0
" despite the current controversies , @entity95 said she expects at least some of @entity3 's government funding to survive the current budget wars in @entity0 and the political onslaught by conservatives			1
" i do n't think public broadcasting is going to be zeroed out because i do n't believe people across this country want to see public funding zeroed out , " @entity95 said			0
" i think they may feel that , like every other institution , it needs to be reduced because of the deficit , but not zeroed out			0
" @entity59 gained notoriety for posing as a pimp and secretly taping damaging conversations with employees at the @entity141 ( @entity142 )			0
he was also involved in a failed plot to embarrass a @entity1 correspondent on hidden camera			0
a @entity147 spokeswoman indicated wednesday that her network also received an invitation from the men to meet for similar purposes , but broke off communication when an attempt to confirm the existence of their alleged organization proved " unsatisfactory			0
" in the @entity3 video , @entity20 and another @entity3 executive are shown having lunch with potential donors , who were really working undercover for @entity59 , posing as representatives of a @entity68 organization considering making a $ 5 million donation			1
" @entity22 people " are n't " just islamaphobic , but really xenophobic , " @entity20 says on the recording			2
" i mean basically they are , they believe in sort of white , middle - @entity170 gun - toting			0
i mean , it 's scary			2
they 're seriously racist , racist people			0
" he went on to say , " the @entity22 is fanatically involved in people 's personal lives and very fundamental @entity176			2
i would n't even call it @entity176			0
it 's this weird evangelical kind of move			0
" in the video , @entity20 says that @entity3 , which is partially funded by government money , would be " better off without federal funding			1
" " the problem is that if we lost it now , a lot of stations would go dark , " he said			0
late tuesday evening , @entity20 issued an apology through @entity3			2
" while the meeting i participated in turned out to be a ruse , i made statements during the course of the meeting that are counter to @entity3 's values and also not reflective of my own beliefs , " @entity13 said in a statement			1
" i offer my sincere apology to those i offended			0
i resigned from @entity3 , previously effective may 6 , to accept another job			2
in an effort to put this unfortunate matter behind us , @entity3 and i have agreed that my resignation is effective today			2
" @entity3 spokeswoman @entity203 on tuesday condemned @entity20 's remarks , saying they " are contrary to everything we stand for ... and we completely disavow the views expressed			1
" " @entity3 is fair and open minded about the people we cover , " said @entity95 , @entity3 's senior vice president for marketing , communications , and external relations			2
" our reporting reflects those values every single day -- in the civility of our programming , the range of opinions we reflect and the diversity of stories we tell			0
" @entity95 also decried @entity20 's statement that @entity3 would be " better off without federal funding , " saying it " does not reflect reality			1
the elimination of federal funding would significantly damage public broadcasting as a whole			1
" @entity20 previously said he had accepted a position at the @entity229 , an organization which , according to its mission statement , aims to " foster values - based leadership encouraging individuals to reflect on the ideals and ideas that define a good society and to provide a neutral and balanced venue for discussing and acting on critical issues			0
" the @entity229 said in a statement wednesday that @entity20 will not be working there			0
" @entity20 has informed us that , in light of the controversy surrounding his recent statements , he does not feel that it 's in the best interests of the @entity229 for him to come work here , " the organization said			0
@entity1 's @entity248 contributed to this report .			0
