-- " out of an abundance of caution , " @entity0 said tuesday it would inspect 47 @entity3 757 airplanes after seats on two of the company 's jetliners came loose			1
a @entity3 757 from @entity10 to @entity11 carrying 175 passengers diverted to @entity14 's @entity13 on saturday when three seats in row 12 came loose shortly after takeoff			0
a second @entity0 @entity3 returned to @entity13 on monday morning after a similar seat issue was discovered			2
" originally , @entity0 planned to evaluate the seats on eight @entity3 757 airplanes , but out of an abundance of caution , the decision was made to proactively evaluate a total of 47 @entity3 757 airplanes that have the same model @entity27 seats with a common locking mechanism , " company spokeswoman @entity18 said in a statement			1
" @entity0 's internal investigation has focused on one of three types of @entity27 seats on the 757s and how the rows of these three seats fit into the track that is used to secure the rows to the floor of the airplanes			1
our maintenance and engineering teams have discovered that the root cause is a saddle clamp improperly installed on the foot of the row leg , " she said			0
the clamps were used on 47 of the company 's 102 @entity3 757 airplanes			0
so far , @entity0 has inspected 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured			1
not all of the seats were loose , the company said , but they had the potential to become so			2
eleven aircraft still need to be inspected			0
@entity18 said the seats issue does not appear to be connected to any one work group or maintenance facility , and apologized for any inconvenience to customers			0
" safety is -- and always will be -- @entity0 's top concern , " the spokeswoman said			2
the @entity68 is looking into the incidents of loose seats , which are the latest in a string of woes for @entity0			1
earlier tuesday , an @entity0 flight from @entity75 to @entity76 made an unscheduled landing at @entity78 in @entity79 after a passenger reported a smoky odor , an airline spokesman said			1
@entity83 98 , a @entity84 carrying 246 passengers and 14 crew members , was diverted as a precaution , airline spokesman @entity82 told @entity1			0
an inspection revealed that the odor was coming from an overhead fan that had overheated , he said			0
@entity91 , head of operations for @entity78 , said such technical diversions are not uncommon			0
who wants to fly @entity0 ? the airline has also been beset recently by labor troubles , delays and flight cancellations			1
@entity0 , which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year , persuaded a judge to throw out its contract with the pilots union last month			1
since then , the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket			2
more than 1,000 @entity0 flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone			2
airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it claims are frivolous reports about aircraft problems			1
the pilots union has denied management 's assertion			0
late tuesday , a spokesman for the @entity120 said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline			1
@entity124 said talks could start as early as wednesday			0
a company spokesman similarly said that negotiations are set to resume this week			1
meanwhile , @entity128 , deputy director of the @entity129 of the @entity130 , dismissed the notion that the problems with loose seats were linked to labor issues as " without any basis in fact			2
" seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors , rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline , he said in a statement			0
" problems related to seats are less likely a labor problem , but rather a management issue related to outsourcing work to third - party facilities , " he said			0
@entity0 plans to increase its use of outside maintenance facilities , including in @entity150 and other overseas locations , as it seeks to exit bankruptcy , he added			0
seats come loose on two @entity0 flights @entity1 's @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report .			1

new : contract negotiations between the company , pilots are expected to resume this week
