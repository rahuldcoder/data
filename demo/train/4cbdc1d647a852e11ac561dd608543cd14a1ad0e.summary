@entity1 , @entity0 -- the political arm of @entity0 's @entity4 has announced plans to run one of its leaders in the country 's presidential elections in may , reversing an earlier pledge to stay out of the race			1
the once - banned @entity14 movement will be represented by @entity15 , a longtime financial backer , the @entity4 announced over the weekend			1
@entity17 has resigned from his post as deputy chairman to join the already crowded field of presidential candidates , group said			0
the jail terms he served under @entity24 strongman @entity23 had been an obstacle that would have kept him off the ballot			1
but the @entity28 , which took power after the 2011 uprising that toppled @entity23 , pardoned him sunday , his lawyer , @entity31 , told @entity2			0
the @entity4 has pledged repeatedly that it would not field a presidential candidate			1
but candidates from its political arm , the @entity36 , won the largest share of seats in @entity0 's parliamentary elections in december			1
and @entity4 leader @entity40 said saturday the new @entity0 " is under a serious threat " because its current , military - led government " has failed to represent the will of the people			1
" more than 450 people have already registered or announced plans to seek the presidency			0
among them are former @entity50 secretary - general @entity49 -- who served as @entity23 's foreign minister -- and @entity52 , an opposition leader jailed by @entity23 and recently pardoned as well			1
the field also includes other @entity14 presidential hopefuls , including the ultra-conservative @entity56 candidate @entity55 and former @entity4 member @entity55 , who broke with the @entity4 over what he called its authoritarian style			2
@entity60 is a furniture and textile magnate who has led the @entity4 's business association			1
though considered a conservative , he is also credited with being the driving force behind the @entity4 's affirmation that @entity0 should continue to honor its international agreements -- including its peace treaty with @entity68			1
liberals and secularists who led the uprising against @entity23 fear that a victory in the presidential elections , the first round of which begins may 23 , may lead the @entity4 to impose a fundamentalist @entity78 agenda on @entity0			1
" their stance continues to change as they strengthen their political position , " socialist activist @entity79 said			0
" they were patient after @entity23 fell and announced that they would not seek more than 20 % of the seats in parliament			0
the number went up to 30 , and now they have won more than half of the constituent assembly			0
" but @entity92 , a founding member of the @entity93 , said @entity15 's entry into the race may be a bid to make an example of @entity98 , " who had defected against their will			2
" " @entity98 is championed by the revolutionaries and not favored by the military , " @entity92 said			0
" they also want to make a point to the youth of the @entity4 that abandoning the group may cripple one 's ambition			2
" in march , the @entity4 blasted the @entity28 for holding onto power despite the parliamentary elections and questioning whether the generals would try to rig the presidential vote			1
in a rare and charged public response , the generals hit back against what they called a " baseless slander " and an " unacceptable " challenge to the legitimacy of elections			0
@entity60 is a 61 - year - old civil engineer who became a millionaire businessman			2
he has been involved with @entity14 groups since the late 1960s , according to his official biography , and was jailed for five years by a military court during a crackdown on @entity14 movements in the mid- 1990s			0
in 2007 , he was charged with providing funds and weapons to college students and imprisoned again			0
he was still behind bars when the regime fell in february 2011 , and the military junta that took power from @entity23 released him for medical reasons a month later			2
before sunday 's pardon , that record could have disqualified him from the race			0
@entity2 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
