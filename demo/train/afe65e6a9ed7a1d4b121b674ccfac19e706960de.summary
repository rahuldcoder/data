@entity0 -- after weeks of talking past each other , congressional leaders and president @entity3 talked to each other wednesday evening -- only to emerge evidently no closer to a deal to halt the government 's budget stalemate			1
the @entity11 meeting , coming a day after the start of the federal government shutdown , served at least one purpose , in that key players in the debate gathered together in the same room for over an hour : @entity3 called it " useful , " @entity11 minority leader @entity17 said it was " worthwhile , " and @entity11 speaker @entity19 cast it as a " polite conversation			1
" but while the sides talked , there was no indication they agreed on anything or even shifted their views			2
senate minority leader @entity28 , for instance , went so far as to call it " unproductive			1
" neither side discussed any potential compromises , with @entity3 and vice president @entity34 doing most of the talking and @entity19 making clear he wo n't go forward with a " clean " funding bill -- with no @entity38 amendments -- a @entity31 congressional source said			1
republicans , led by tea party conservatives in the @entity11 , have demanded provisions to defund or delay @entity3 's signature @entity38 be attached to any government spending plan , a strategy that @entity43 have called a non-starter			1
moreover , the parties are on the verge of another crisis -- over whether to raise the debt ceiling by october 17 , at which point the federal government wo n't be able to pay its bills			2
" at times like this , the @entity53 people expect their leaders to come together to find ways to resolve their differences , " @entity19 said			0
" the president reiterated one more time tonight that he will not negotiate			0
" a few minutes later , senate majority leader @entity61 claimed that it was @entity19 -- not the president or his fellow @entity43 -- who has refused to budge on budgetary matters , saying " we 're through playing these little games			1
" @entity61 said @entity43 leaders offered @entity19 " a lifeline " by setting up negotiations " about anything that you want to talk about " so long as the @entity11 agrees to reopen the government first			1
" i thought that they were concerned about the long - term fiscal affairs of this country			0
and we said , ' we are too			0
let 's talk about it , ' " the @entity77 @entity76 said			0
" my friend , @entity19 ... can not take yes for an answer			0
" in an interview with @entity84 prior to the meeting , @entity3 said he was " prepared to negotiate on anything " regarding the federal budget -- but only after @entity86 passes " a clean piece of legislation that reopens the government " and allows the @entity53 " @entity87 to pay for things that @entity86 itself already authorized			1
" " am i exasperated ? " @entity3 said of @entity19 , who is under pressure from fiscal hawks , and is refusing to let the @entity11 vote on the @entity99 - approved spending plan			1
" i am absolutely exasperated , because this is entirely unnecessary			2
" the president foreshadowed @entity19 's comments that he would n't negotiate with @entity31 in their attempts to tie government funding to @entity38 changes			1
doing so , the president said , would set a dangerous precedent			0
" if we get in the habit where a few folks , an extremist wing of one party ... are allowed to extort concessions based on a threat of undermining the full faith and credit of the @entity53 , then any president that comes after me ... will find themselves unable to govern effectively , " @entity3 said			1
" and that is not something that i 'm going to allow to happen			0
" @entity53 hurt as @entity0 ' squabbles like kids ' @entity31 spending measures unlikely to advance fresh off having sent four separate proposals tying funding the government to either delaying or defunding @entity38 -- each of which was rejected by the @entity99 -- the @entity31 - led @entity11 continued to work wednesday , albeit on another plan @entity43 say wo n't go anywhere			1
a day after an initial effort failed because the short - term proposals comprising a tiny portion of the overall federal budget lacked the necessary two - thirds majority support due to @entity43 opposition , the @entity11 passed -- with majority support -- bills to fund national parks , the @entity140 and @entity0 operations			1
the incremental approach pushed by sen. @entity143 of @entity144 seeks to pressure @entity43 to approve spending for programs that @entity31 like , but not @entity38			1
yet @entity3 has signaled he 'd veto those measures should they reach his desk			1
that 's unlikely , given that @entity99 majority leader @entity61 has dismissed the @entity31 approach as " reckless and irresponsible			1
" shutdown ' extremely damaging ' to @entity53 intelligence operations while expressing openness to budgetary negotiations generally , @entity43 have said they 'll only talk after @entity86 passes a clean spending measure			1
both democrats and @entity31 say such a bill would pass the @entity11 with support from the @entity43 minority and moderate @entity31			1
so far , @entity19 has succumbed to pressure from the tea party right to avoid a vote that would pass something without causing some harm to the health care reforms			0
one problem is that conservative @entity169 from home districts with no realistic @entity43 challenge feel emboldened to pursue a more extremist ideology backed by their supporters , @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity167 said			0
" more people say raise the debt ceiling and fight the health care debate somewhere else , " he noted			0
" but there 's enough here , if you think of a @entity31 going home to his district , there 's enough here to understand why the @entity31 think they 're on safe ground dragging this out			2
" decision to raise debt ceiling , or risk default , looms the looming debt crisis could pose even more headaches , and confrontation , in the coming weeks			0
failing to raise it may mean a @entity53 default on its debt , something @entity3 stressed in wednesday 's @entity11 meeting that the country ca n't afford to do , according to @entity61			1
@entity3 offered no indication that he 'll budge			2
noting that such @entity31 brinkmanship in 2011 led to the first - ever downgrade of the @entity53 credit rating , the president said tuesday he " will not negotiate over @entity86 ' responsibility to pay bills it 's already racked up			1
" writing the same day in @entity208 , @entity19 dug in his heels on the issue , saying " there is no way @entity86 can or should pass such a bill without spending cuts and reforms to deal with the debt and deficit			2
" raising the debt ceiling ? still , that crisis is still a few weeks away			0
the government shutdown is the one currently affecting hundreds of thousands of furloughed government workers , not to mention millions of others who rely on government programs , visit national parks and have some other type of interaction with affected programs			2
one moderate @entity31 who has backed a clean spending measure , rep. @entity228 of @entity229 , said that " both sides have dug in			1
" democrats , who he said " wo n't even have a discussion , " put @entity11 @entity31 in a tight spot where they feel compelled to hold their ground or else " set a bad precedent that the @entity99 would be somewhat dictating how the @entity11 runs			1
" but if @entity43 agreed to listen , @entity228 expressed optimism " that we would put a package together and solve the problems at once , so we can get the government funded , stop the shutdown , and also deal with the debt ceiling so we do n't have another crisis a week or two away from now			2
" government shutdown forces clinical trial patients to wait @entity17 said that scores of @entity43 have reluctantly offered to back a plan to fund the entire government at a figure that 's been bandied about by @entity31 , albeit well below what her party members want			1
the other option would be to reconcile budgets passed by both chambers earlier this year in a conference committee , as is @entity0 custom			0
but what @entity43 wo n't stand for , @entity17 said , is @entity31 legislators shuttering the government due to their opposition to @entity38 , which previously passed through @entity86 and withstood a @entity261 challenge			1
" that 's not what our @entity264 had in mind : that if you do n't like something , you threaten to shut down the government , " the @entity262 @entity76 said			2
" it 's not that kind of system			0
" a blow to the economy the shutdown of the government -- the country 's largest employer -- is n't happening all at once			2
federal employees who are considered essential will continue working			0
those deemed non-essential -- up to 800,000 -- could be furloughed , unsure when they 'll be able to work or get paid again			0
the shutdown could cost the still - struggling @entity53 economy about $ 1 billion a week in pay lost by furloughed federal workers			0
and that 's only the tip of the iceberg			0
@entity86 still gets paid while many agencies have reserve funds and contingency plans that would give them some short - term leeway , the economic effect would snowball as the shutdown continued			0
the total economic impact is likely to be at least 10 times greater than the simple calculation of lost wages of federal workers , said @entity298 , economist with @entity299			0
his firm estimates that a three - to four - week shutdown would cost the economy about $ 55 billion			0
and it 's already had political ramifications extending beyond the @entity53			0
on wednesday , @entity3 canceled planned visits next week to @entity306 and the @entity307 as part of an @entity310 swing that will include a summit of the @entity312 on @entity313			2
@entity3 will still attend the @entity312 summit , his office said			2
