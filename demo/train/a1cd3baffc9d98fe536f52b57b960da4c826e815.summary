-- never bet against @entity1			1
in a world where so much can change so quickly , perhaps it is reassuring that there is one constant which remains			0
the nation which had ripped @entity9 's dreams to shreds in the semifinals , won its fourth @entity12 after a tense 1 - 0 victory over @entity14 sunday			1
@entity16 's strike , seven minutes from the end of extra time , ensured @entity1 ended its 24 - year wait for glory at @entity22 's @entity21			1
for all the doubters who said that no @entity26 side would or could ever win the @entity12 on @entity28 soil , there was one team which refused to listen			1
lazy stereotypes often abound when describing @entity32 football			0
the words ' organized ' , ' ruthless ' or ' machine ' are bandied about along with that other @entity35 © , ' efficient			0
' to use those words to describe this @entity32 side would not only do it a disservice -- it would ignore the wonderful talent which passes through the veins of each and every player			0
@entity1 has long threatened to rule the world			1
in 2006 , it came close , bowing out at the semifinal stage after a painful defeat by @entity47 in a tournament held in its own country			0
two years later , it was beaten in the final of the @entity52 by @entity53 before the same opposition ended its @entity12 dream in @entity56			1
bizarre moments from the @entity12 final at @entity59 , @entity47 once again was its nemesis as @entity1 fell at the semifinal stage of @entity59			1
nobody doubted @entity1 's talent -- but critics said it did not have the ability to get over the winning line			1
the sight of @entity68 , bloodied and bruised , provided all the insight you needed into the psyche of this @entity32 team			0
it can do ugly -- but it can do beautiful too			0
that beauty was there for all to see when @entity16 took @entity77 's cross on his chest and volleyed the ball past the @entity81 's despairing dive			1
but in @entity83 and @entity84 , it has steel , in @entity68 it has a warrior and in @entity87 it has a man who can do everything			0
few could begrudge @entity1 this success -- it has been the team of the @entity92			1
@entity1 has thrilled in this tournament			1
its 4 - 0 victory over @entity95 was sublime ; its 7 - 1 thrashing of @entity9 was mesmerizing			1
but this win , secured through guts , fight and a moment of magic from one of its bright new stars showed that @entity1 overcame the most difficult hurdle of all			2
with the game deadlocked at 0 - 0 after 90 minutes , substitute @entity16 provided the game 's defining moment with a touch of magic			1
the @entity113 star took @entity77 's pass on his chest before displaying exquisite technique to volley the ball past @entity81			0
@entity14 , which was beaten by @entity1 1 - 0 at the @entity118 , rallied briefly but failed to find an equalizer			1
even with the mercurial @entity120 in attack , @entity14 were unable to take the game to penalties -- not that it deserved to			1
for all the talk of @entity120 , it was left to another wonderful talent and his left foot to steal the headlines with the decisive goal			0
at least @entity9 could smile once again -- there is not enough beer in the entire country to distract from the prospect of an @entity135 party on the @entity136			0
@entity14 failed to muster a single shot on target during the contest -- and yet it will walk away ruing three wonderful chances to have won the tie			2
with 20 minutes played , @entity142 , so impressive throughout the tournament , inexplicably headed the ball over his own defense for @entity146 to run through on goal			1
the @entity149 striker did everything right			0
he took a touch , allowed the ball to move slightly in front of him and with just @entity155 to beat , then somehow shanked his effort horribly wide			0
as @entity146 stood still in disbelief and his teammates held their heads in their hands , @entity1 breathed again			1
for a side so assured in its 7 - 1 victory over @entity9 , @entity1 were rattled by a couple of team changes -- just before the final and soon after the game had started			1
deprived of @entity168 through injury after the midfielder suffered an injury just before kickoff , @entity1 's shape was disrupted further when replacement @entity173 was forced off following a heavy clash with @entity176			1
as @entity1 regrouped the @entity28 side constantly looked to use the flanks to exploit a lack of pace in their opponents ' defense			2
it was from the right flank which @entity14 created the move it thought had provided the crucial breakthrough			2
@entity187 found space on the right before delivering the perfect cross for @entity146 to fire home from close range			2
as @entity146 wheeled away to celebrate and those draped in blue and white danced with joy , the flag of the assistant referee was held aloft after the forward was correctly adjudged to be offside			2
@entity1 , having scored seven in its previous game against @entity9 , began to wake from its slumber and only a fine save from @entity81 prevented @entity142 ' fierce drive from nestling in the corner			1
but with just a minute of the first half remaining , @entity81 was forced to thank the woodwork as @entity14 got out of jail in dramatic circumstances			2
@entity142 ' corner dissected the @entity135 defense and @entity209 flew through the air before sending a thunderous header against the post			0
forced to play 120 minutes during its semifinal against the @entity214 , @entity14 showed little signs of tiredness and made a rapid start to the second half			1
once again it was @entity120 causing problems , this time latching onto @entity219 's through ball before running clear of the @entity32 defense			0
the boy from @entity230 , the boy who left home at 13 and moved halfway across the world to @entity233 to become the world 's greatest			0
he 'd been here so many times before			0
the ball was in his stride , the goalkeeper was advancing , the net was supposed to bulge			0
@entity120 dragged his shot wide			0
@entity135 hearts sank , @entity32 stood relieved , almost open mouthed			0
proof that the world 's best player is human after all			0
having seen @entity14 contrive to miss two wonderful opportunities , perhaps those in @entity32 shirts believed this would be their night			2
it certainly had chances to win the contest before the end of 90 minutes with @entity142 firing wide from 20 - yards , while @entity77 failed to control the ball after moving in on goal			1
with an extra day 's rest following its semifnal victory over @entity9 , @entity77 brought out a sharp save from @entity81 as @entity1 picked up the tempo			1
but @entity14 remained a threat on the counter attack and substitute @entity263 should have done better than hook his effort high and wide after being played through on goal			1
with tired limbs and minds beginning to show , the pace of the contest slowed with both sets of players struggling to create any kind of chance			0
challenges began to fly in with @entity275 fortunate to escape a second yellow card , while @entity68 was left with a blood pouring from his face after a clash with @entity280			0
@entity77 , found space down the left and his cross picked out @entity16 , who took the ball on his chest before volleying the ball past @entity81 and into the far corner			2
it was a goal worthy of winning any @entity12 -- a wonderful strike which came with just seven minutes of the contest remaining			1
@entity14 tried to respond but while minds were willing , bodies were not			2
@entity120 was anonymous , his final effort from a free kick sailing high into the stand			0
those in white turned towards the center circle , the sight of gleaming gold trophy was there for all to see			0
a campaign which began with the thrashing with @entity95 ended with victory over the team which so many had tipped for victory			0
perhaps @entity14 should have known			2
never bet against @entity1 .			2

@entity1 defeats @entity14 1 - 0 in @entity12 final
@entity16 scored only goal of the game on 113 minutes
@entity314 finished 0 - 0 after 90 minutes
@entity146 wasted @entity14 's best opportunity
