-- @entity1 have every right to be frustrated			1
the @entity3 laid claim to these eastern islands of a @entity7 archipelago in 1900 , and since that time , @entity1 have served in the @entity3 military , including the wars in @entity10 and @entity11			1
yet , those born in @entity1 receive passports declaring the holder is only a @entity3 national , not a @entity3 citizen			1
noncitizen residents complain they are unable to vote in national elections or to work in jobs that require citizenship status			2
they also claim their birth status renders them ineligible for federal work - study programs in college , firearm permits and travel / immigration visas			2
if they want to become citizens , @entity1 must relocate to another part of the @entity3 to initiate the naturalization process , pay a $ 680 fee and be subjected to a moral character assessment , fingerprinting and the @entity34 / civics examination			1
quite a process to become citizens of the nation that they consider their home			0
@entity1 indeed have every right to be frustrated			1
however , they have zero legal right to be @entity3 citizens			0
while it 's true that they would likely win their case in nearly every court of public opinion , they will ultimately lose in all the courts that count : actual courts of law			2
as with many things , when it comes to citizenship , little is guaranteed to residents of the @entity56			0
@entity1 have challenged federal laws and policy that decline to grant citizenship			1
the federal district court in the @entity61 granted the government 's motion to dismiss the lawsuit , but the @entity65 , the appellate court , is giving the @entity1 another chance to argue their case			1
the last @entity1 frontier the @entity68 are the last @entity1 frontier			1
they are as rugged as the @entity70 and arguably as picturesque			0
because of patchwork governance and varying isolation from the mainland , their outward appearances run the gamut : from teeming , vibrant quasi-state to desolated , sun - blasted rock , all scattered to the corners of the globe			0
so what of the residents of these @entity56 ? they are people like you or me			0
are they @entity3 citizens ? or -- like the soil on which they live -- are they considered another " possession " of the @entity3 ? the short answer is : they are whatever @entity96 wants them to be			1
whether that sounds fair or not , there 's little to dispute legally			0
territorial residents are not without any constitutional protections			0
the @entity101 defined the extent to which the @entity103 applies in @entity56 in a series of cases known to those of us who live or work in the @entity56 as the @entity109			1
these cases held that only specific " fundamental " constitutional rights are guaranteed to @entity112 inhabitants			0
the question then is whether the @entity114 of the 14th @entity115 applies to @entity1			2
the @entity114 provides that " [ a ] ll persons born or naturalized in the @entity3 and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the @entity3 and of the state wherein they reside			0
" @entity1 is certainly " subject to the jurisdiction " of the @entity3			2
but residents must also be born " in the @entity3 " for the constitutional right to attach			0
unfortunately , for 14th @entity115 citizenship purposes , the @entity56 have never been considered " in the @entity3			0
" no federal court has ever recognized birthright citizenship as a guarantee in unincorporated territories			2
in fact , federal courts have held on many occasions that unincorporated territories are not included within the " @entity3 " for purposes of the @entity114			0
because these residents have no @entity135 , automatic right to citizenship , @entity96 can pick and choose how they become citizens			1
in fact , it has done just that : granting citizenship at birth to residents of other @entity56			0
for example , residents of @entity145 and the @entity146 are citizens if born there			0
but that citizenship does not flow from any constitutional right			0
rather , @entity96 has chosen to pass independent legislation giving those residents citizenship			1
indeed , justice @entity153 of the @entity101 observed in one opinion that the only remaining noncitizen nationals are residents of @entity1 and @entity156			2
when it comes to citizenship in the @entity56 , @entity96 can giveth or it can choose not to giveth , and the @entity103 gives those residents no recourse			1
annexation and inconvenience ? the public policy is clear			0
courts have been reluctant to force @entity96 to grant citizenship to persons merely because the @entity3 has annexed their homeland			1
courts and the legislature alike cite the practical inconvenience to the federal government			1
the theory : if the practice of acquiring territories required endowing the inhabitants with citizenship of the @entity3 , this would be too great an inconvenience to the government			2
then again , imagine the inconvenience to the newly annexed inhabitants who suddenly find themselves without citizenship anywhere			0
@entity1 have fought in our armed services for over a century , so it feels fundamentally unfair that they get short shrift when it comes to citizenship			1
the problem is , fairness can not overcome the language of the @entity103 and centuries of legal precedent			2
fair or not , @entity1 will likely lose this legal battle , even though the @entity196 has given them a glimmer of hope and a second chance , of sorts			1
citizenship for them is not a constitutional right ; it can not be grafted onto them by any court			0
only @entity96 can choose to grant citizenship to @entity112 inhabitants			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : @entity1 are right to be frustrated
he says *samoans* are suing the federal government to get citizenship rights
@entity103 gives the power to make that *decision* to @entity96 , he says
@entity210 : it seems fair to change law so that @entity1 get citizenship
