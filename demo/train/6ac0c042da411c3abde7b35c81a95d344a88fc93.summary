-- @entity1 , who as a member of the @entity3 sang lead on such hits as " i 'll be around " and " @entity6 , " has died			1
@entity1 died saturday of complications of pneumonia and the h1n1 flu virus , according to a statement from @entity12 , the @entity3 ' manager			1
the @entity3 were one of the longest - lived bands in pop music , with the core of the group having formed in the 1950s			1
three members of the group -- @entity1 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- met in a @entity22 - area high school , and were later joined by @entity23 and @entity24			1
it was @entity1 who came up with the name , he told @entity28 of @entity29			1
" all my life i loved cars , " he said			0
people " would round off the front , the hood or change the grille			0
they would lower ' em in the back			0
they called ' em bubble skirts and in the front they would have these big chrome hub caps			2
@entity43 hubcaps , and they called ' em spinners			1
so that 's how we got the name ... from a hubcap			2
" the group was signed to a small local label , @entity52 , by @entity54 legend @entity53 and his soon - to - be wife , @entity55			2
@entity52 was later taken over by @entity56 , owned by @entity58 's brother , @entity57			2
an early hit , " @entity60 , " featured @entity1 on lead vocals			1
but the @entity3 never found their niche at @entity56 , often working around the office while other male vocal groups on the label -- including the @entity66 , the @entity67 and the @entity68 -- went on to major success			1
" when we were at @entity56 and we had a hit , we would n't get another record released for another year			0
so now you 're playing catch - up , " @entity1 told @entity28			1
" when you get a hit , you got ta keep popping ' em out there , you know			0
and so , we felt like we got lost in the shuffle at @entity56			0
" @entity79 knew who they were , though , thanks to the group 's showmanship			1
in the liner notes to " the @entity86 , " a 2003 boxed set , @entity88 credits the group with the best show he ever saw			2
even a @entity92 - produced 1970 hit , " it 's a @entity94 , " did n't help the group at @entity56 , which had by then assigned them to a minor subsidiary called @entity56			1
the label let them go not long after			0
thanks to advice from fan @entity99 , the @entity3 soon got another chance , with @entity101			1
more importantly , in @entity103 they had a producer who catered to their musical strengths			0
@entity103 was also responsible for arranging or producing a huge number of songs at the @entity110 label , owned by @entity111 and @entity111			0
" his way of producing was top of the line , " @entity19 told @entity0 in 2003			2
( @entity19 died in 2007			0
) " with @entity103 , everything was designed for us			0
" for the next several years , it was hit after hit : " i 'll be around , " " @entity120 ) , " " @entity117 " ( with @entity121 ) , " @entity122 , " and " @entity6			1
" @entity1 split the lead vocal duties with @entity124			1
" we had always been promised ( by @entity56 ) that , ' this is your year , ' " @entity19 recalled			0
@entity101 " moved us into a new circle			0
" the @entity3 were the greatest soul group of the early ' 70s , creating a body of work that defined the lush , seductive sound of @entity136 soul , " wrote @entity129 on @entity130			1
despite occasional changes , the band was remarkably long - lived			0
after @entity124 left the band in 1977 ( he died in 1984 ) , various combinations of @entity1 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity23 and " it 's a @entity94 " vocalist @entity142 toured with the @entity3 into the early 2000s			1
overall , the band had seven top 10 singles and five gold albums			0
the @entity3 were inducted into the @entity146 in 1999 and have a star on the @entity148			2
@entity1 was diagnosed with lung cancer last november , according to the statement			2
among his final requests was " to make people aware of his cancer , so as to once again bring to the forefront the many dangers of smoking			0
" people we lost in 2013 : the lives they lived			0
