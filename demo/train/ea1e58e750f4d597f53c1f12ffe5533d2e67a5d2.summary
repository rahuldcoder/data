-- the @entity1 has drawn up an ambitious wish list of some of the sport 's biggest names to replace departed coach @entity6			1
@entity7 of the bill is undoubtedly @entity10 coach @entity9 , who quit the former @entity12 and @entity13 champions at the end of last season in order to take a break from the game			2
former @entity20 coach @entity19 is also on the 13 - man list , posted on the @entity1 website on tuesday , along with his fellow @entity24 @entity23 -- a @entity25 winner in 2006 , and now with @entity27 team @entity26			1
@entity28 and @entity30 coach @entity29 is also being considered , despite insisting that he wants to stay at @entity31 in the wake of an argument with the @entity13 club 's board			2
the @entity1 is also targeting two men with less international - level experience but a good club pedigree : @entity39 and @entity40			1
former @entity41 and @entity42 boss @entity39 has not held a coaching position since being sacked by @entity44 in december 2010 , while @entity40 is a more recent addition to the unemployed ranks after being sacked by @entity48 club @entity47 in june			1
@entity40 had been widely favored to replace @entity19 as @entity20 coach , but the 65 - year - old missed out as @entity51 was instead appointed ahead of @entity52			1
@entity53 , who took @entity54 to the quarterfinals of the @entity56 , is one of seven @entity57 on the list			0
former @entity60 international @entity59 coached the national side from 2002 - 03 , while @entity62 was in charge in 1998 and led the @entity65 team to @entity67 gold a decade before that			0
@entity70 's @entity69 had a brief spell as @entity73 boss in 2005			0
of the others , former @entity76 manager @entity75 and @entity77 ( @entity74 ) have had no top - level international experience , while @entity80 coaches the @entity73 under - 21 team			0
@entity73 's last two coaches have been @entity82 , with @entity6 following @entity84			0
@entity84 took @entity73 to the semifinals of @entity86 , but then failed to qualify for the @entity87 as the team surprisingly lost to unfancied @entity89 in a playoff			0
he is now coach at @entity91			0
@entity6 helped @entity92 become only the second @entity57 club to win a @entity12 title in the second - tier @entity95 in 2008 , and was named @entity73 coach after a short spell in charge of both @entity100 's national side and @entity102 team @entity101			1
he announced before @entity52 that he would stand down after the tournament to return to his homeland with @entity105 , and @entity73 crashed out in the group stage after failing to follow up the impressive opening 4 - 1 win over the @entity108 .			2

former @entity111 coach @entity9 is wanted by @entity73
he is *joined* on 13 - man wish list by @entity19 and @entity23
@entity57 also targeting @entity29 , @entity40 and @entity39
@entity6 left @entity73 *job* after @entity52 to return to club coaching
