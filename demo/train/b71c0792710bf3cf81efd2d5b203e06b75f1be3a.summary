-- @entity1 never wrote any songs about body glitter or throwing up in the closet			2
so one may wonder why ke $ ha appears on @entity8 's new benefit disc " @entity9 , " a 76 - track collection of @entity1 covers that also features @entity10 ( '' @entity11 '' ) , @entity12 ( '' i shall be released '' ) , and yes , @entity15 ( '' @entity14 '' ) , among others			1
but on her stripped - down '' @entity17 , '' ke $ ha gets the song 's heartbreak right ; you can actually hear her sobbing between verses			1
if there 's ever a reason to believe the girl 's capable of deeper feelings than '' vaguely hungover , '' this is it			2
to quote from the 1964 @entity1 song that gives this comp its name , @entity1 has always been a champion of '' the countless confused , accused , misused , strung - out ones , an ' worse			1
'' so it makes sense that the best covers here come from the misfits ( ke $ ha ) , the punks ( check out @entity50 's raging '' @entity48 '' ) , the outsiders ( @entity37 pop star @entity36 ± ana 's excellent '' @entity35 '' ) , and the radicals ( '' with @entity39 on our side '' finds @entity53 - born @entity52 rapper @entity51 challenging @entity55 hawkishness as only a @entity56 can )			1
@entity57 calls off engagement the savviest musicians here flip @entity1 's messages for their own aims , just as @entity1 reappropriated protest songs by civil rights heroes			1
@entity66 - rock stalwarts @entity64 take on '' @entity67 '' -- which itself was inspired by @entity69 drinking songs -- and reclaim it for @entity70			0
@entity71 recasts 1981 's born - again '' property of @entity73 '' as a fiery church - reform anthem			2
and @entity75 smartly plays '' just like a woman '' as a feminist ballad			1
when she sings '' you break just like a little girl , '' it sounds like she 's telling @entity1 to man up			2
there 's just one problem			0
that leaves 60 - something more songs , and an unholy amount of strummy - strummy - strum ( though you can buy digital tracks individually , and an edited two - disc version is available for $ 14.95 at @entity90 )			0
@entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , and other major talents opt for straight , folky readings of songs that beg for a reggaeton arrangement or a brostep remix -- anything to update the same classics we 've heard a bajillion times before			0
true , @entity103 and @entity104 bring some freshness , but even they ca n't resist those bland open - mic - at - the - fair - trade - coffee - shop guitars			0
where 's the prankster spirit that got @entity1 booed at @entity111 ? apologies to @entity113 and @entity114 , whose respective rootsy spins on '' @entity115 '' and '' @entity117 or '' are lovely , but after listening to your trillionth fingerpicking solo , it 's easy to think , '' @entity1 went electric for this ? '' @entity122 taken to hospital in @entity124 by contrast , @entity125 and @entity126 sound almost revolutionary on their gorgeous , avant - classical '' @entity17 , '' the only song that appears twice here			1
it takes major innovation ( and some musical - saw interludes ) to create a wholly original take on an artist who reinvents his own songs every time he plays live			0
and maybe that 's why covering @entity1 seems so hard : at a time when every subway busker thinks he 's the @entity138 , the only man who 's really the '' new @entity1 '' is @entity1 himself			1
