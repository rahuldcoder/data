@entity1 veterans are dying because of delays in diagnosis and treatment at @entity6 hospitals			1
at least 19 veterans have died because of delays in simple medical screenings like colonoscopies or endoscopies , at various @entity6 hospitals or clinics , @entity14 has learned			1
that 's according to an internal document from the @entity1 @entity17 , obtained exclusively by @entity14 , that deals with patients diagnosed with cancer in 2010 and 2011			1
hospital delays are killing war vets the veterans were part of 82 vets who have died or are dying or have suffered serious injuries as a result of delayed diagnosis or treatment for colonoscopies or endoscopies			1
@entity30 is one of the veterans who has suffered from a delay in care			1
@entity30 was having excruciating pain and rectal bleeding in 2011			1
for a year the @entity37 veteran went to several @entity6 clinics and hospitals in @entity40 , trying to get help			1
but the @entity6 's diagnosis was hemorrhoids , and aside from simple pain medication he was told he might need a colonoscopy			1
@entity46 demands answers on @entity6 deaths " the problem was getting worse and i was having more pain , " @entity30 said , talking about one specific @entity6 doctor who he saw every few months			1
" she again examined me and gave me some prescriptions for other things as far as pain and stuff like that and i noticed again she made another comment -- ' may need colonoscopy			2
' " i told her that something needed to be done , " said @entity30			1
" but nothing was ever set up ... a consult was never set up			0
" " i had already been in pain and suffering from this problem for over six months and it was n't getting better , " @entity30 said			1
" i told her that if you were in as much pain as i was and had been going through you would n't wait another two months to see what 's going on			0
you would probably do it this week			0
" @entity30 waited months , even begging for an appointment to have his colonoscopy			1
but he only found himself on a growing list of veterans also waiting for appointments and procedures			2
he was finally told he could have a colonoscopy , many months later			2
" i took it upon my own self to call the department that scheduled that and ask them about it			0
and they said this was the earliest appointment that i could get			0
and i explained to the lady what i had already been through and how much pain i had , and i said if i wait this long there might not be ... ( anything ) we can do about it then			0
i could be even dead by then			0
and the only thing she could tell me was ' i understand that , sir , but i do n't have any control over that			0
' " finally about a year after first complaining to his doctors of the pain , @entity30 got a colonoscopy and doctors discovered a cancerous tumor the size of a baseball			1
the now 44 - year - old veteran is undergoing chemotherapy in an effort to save his life			1
it is unclear whether anyone responsible at the @entity6 has been fired , demoted or even admonished for the delays in care and treatment			1
some of the people responsible may have even received bonuses in recent years for their work , despite the delays in care or treatment for the veterans			1
according to the document obtained by @entity14 , 10 veterans are confirmed to have died in the @entity40 and @entity125 region alone			1
and the document shows 29 vets or their families were sent the disclosures , notifying them they had serious " adverse events " because of delayed care			0
and according to the document the problems go far beyond @entity125 or @entity40			0
in the @entity136 region , five veterans are dead , and 14 vets or their families were sent the disclosures , notified that they suffered " adverse events " because of delayed or denied care or diagnosis , according to the exclusive document			2
in the @entity143 , two veterans died , and four families were sent the disclosures or notified			1
in the @entity147 region , seven vets or their families were sent disclosures about adverse events and serious injuries suffered because of delayed care			0
@entity30 filed a legal claim , citing the " failure of the @entity153 ( @entity40 ) @entity154 to timely diagnose his rectal cancer			1
" the @entity6 settled , but admitted no wrong - doing			1
" i do n't know what my outcome is going to be , " said @entity30			1
" i just try to live every day like it 's my last day			0
" the new document obtained by @entity14 shows a worse problem than has previously been made public by the @entity6			1
as @entity14 has previously reported , as many as 7,000 veterans were on a backlog list -- waiting too long for colonscopies or endoscopies -- at @entity6 facilities in @entity153 , @entity40 and @entity167 , @entity125			1
after @entity14 's detailed accounting of dela - related deaths at the @entity153 and @entity6 hospitals , a bi-partisan group of congressmen visited the hospitals , demanding answers			1
" we have a duty to make sure that the veterans who serve get the best health care possible , " said rep. @entity175 , @entity125			2
" and it is very obvious that for too long and for too many folks that has n't happened			0
" the @entity6 said the backlog at those two hospitals has been solved , but that is not a good enough explanation for rep. @entity187 , the chair of the @entity188			1
" the fact that we 've had veterans who have died in the very facilities that are supposed to be taking care of them , and not by natural means , by means that could have been prevented is egregious , " said @entity187 , @entity136			1
" and it 's not acceptable			0
" @entity187 said the @entity6 , from the top down , has consistently ignored his committee 's requests to find out who is responsible			2
even with the delays in care which have led to deaths and serious injuries , the congressman said not a single person has been fired or even demoted , and in fact some of those responsible may have even gotten bonuses			2
" i grieve for the families who lost loved ones that could have been with them this @entity214 that would be celebrating 2014 today had the backlog not existed , " said @entity187			0
" that 's not what anybody in this country wants for our veterans			2
" he said the lack of accountability is what angers him most			0
" that 's why we asked the question again today , with members of the @entity40 delegation and @entity125 delegation , tell us exactly who was disciplined and how			0
i do n't want to hear the excuse anymore that ' it was multi-faceted			0
... there were many people involved ' " said @entity187			0
" well if there were many people involved then they all need to go			0
we are not asking for one particular person , we want to know exactly why things happened and who was held responsible , at this point publicly , we have n't seen anybody held responsible			0
" @entity14 has made repeated requests for interviews with top officials at the @entity6 , including president @entity248 's appointed head of the @entity17 , secretary @entity249			1
the requests have all been denied , or ignored			0
the @entity6 did issue a written statement from dr. @entity252 , the under secretary for health at the @entity17			2
in the statement , @entity252 wrote that " the @entity17 ( @entity6 ) cares deeply for every veteran we are privileged to serve			1
our goal is to provide the best quality , safe and effective health care our veterans have earned and deserve			0
we take seriously any issue that occurs at any one of the more than 1,700 @entity6 health care facilities across the country			2
" he also stated : " as a result of the consult delay issue @entity6 discovered at two of our medical centers , the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) conducted a national review of consults across the system			2
we have redesigned the consult process to better monitor consult timeliness			0
we continue to take action to strengthen oversight mechanisms and prevent a similar delay at another @entity6 medical center			2
we take any issue of this nature extremely seriously and offer our sincerest condolences to families and individuals who have been affected and lost a loved one			0
" in august 2007 , presidential candidate @entity248 gave a campaign speech to veterans specifically addressing wait lists , denied care and poor treatment of vets			0
he promised his administration would be different			0
" no veteran should have to fill out a 23 - page claim to get care , or wait months -- even years -- to get an appointment at the @entity6 , " said then - candidate @entity248			1
" when we fail to keep faith with our veterans , the bond between our nation and our nation 's heroes becomes frayed			0
when a veteran is denied care , we are all dishonored			0
" but @entity30 said for him the speech is an empty promise			2
" someone needs to stand and face the person who suffered and the veterans who have died and say , ' hey it was me , i let the ball drop , ' " he said			2
" how many lives are we going to lose from this ? " " when is it going to be corrected ? "			0
