-- as the legend goes , it all started with two @entity3 living in @entity4 in search of a good burger			0
bereft of what they considered acceptable options , the pair decided to open their own @entity3 - styled diner with the food and attitude to match			0
they would call this nascent start - up the @entity17			1
over the next two decades this famous old joint became a regular haunt for a-list musicians and a museum for rock star memorabilia			0
today , it 's a global industry with 180 venues in more than 50 countries , including outlets as far afield as @entity27 and @entity28			0
but building this rock and roll empire has n't been easy			0
when current ceo , @entity30 , took over in 2004 many considered the brand old and tired			0
like record companies and music stores , the @entity17 found itself asking how can a business so synonymous with the vinyl epoch stay relevant in the age of the digital download ? " i think that 's part of the challenge for this brand as it does have a history but it 's also part of the beauty , " @entity30 told @entity0			1
" it '' s really around being relevant for the younger consumers ( as ) so many ... are not familiar with ( our ) history			0
" @entity17 has sought to keep up with the latest trends by adapting and expanding its services			1
the company now stages 26,000 live gigs every year , @entity30 said , and has successfully added hotels and casinos to its portfolio since the turn of the century			1
revenues jumped from under $ 1 billion dollars in 2003 to $ 3.5 billion in 2013 with the casino business accounting for the largest chunk of this rise			1
now the @entity17 is aggressively expanding in @entity63 and the @entity64 with plans for hotels in @entity67 and a cafe in @entity69			1
" we 've been here ( in the @entity64 ) a very long time , " @entity30 reflected			1
" our cafes have basically had a very successful run ( and our ) new cafe in @entity28 has really performed extremely well			0
" there 's something special about our brand , it resonates a lot with our @entity64 customers			1
" but with the lucrative gaming side of the business not permitted in many nations within the region , @entity30 sees the more traditional aspects of the cafe 's brand coming to the fore			2
@entity17 t - shirts and other merchandise still account for between 30 % and 50 % of sales at each destination after all			2
" in markets where gaming is not permitted , we still have growth and consumer opportunities in hotels and cafes , " @entity30 said			2
he adds that the company will also look to tailor its offers to the diverse markets it now finds itself operating in			2
" you used to go to a hard rock cafe and they all looked the same			0
" " so we 've changed that mechanic again as part of the brand re-invigoration and we want everyone to be different and to reflect the personality of the building and the country and the people in that country , " he said			0
