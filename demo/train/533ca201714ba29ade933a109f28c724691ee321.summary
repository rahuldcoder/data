-- how do the outer reaches of the sun get so hot ? that 's one of the questions that @entity5 has set out to answer by launching a new telescope that will stare into a mysterious zone between the sun 's surface and outer atmosphere			1
material that travels through the region , known as the solar chromosphere , heats up from about 10,000 degrees @entity15 ( 5,500 degrees @entity14 ) at the sun 's surface to temperatures as high as 3.5 million degrees @entity15 ( 2 million degrees celsius ) farther out , according to @entity5			1
the agency says its @entity21 spacecraft , which reached its orbit thursday evening after taking off from @entity23 in @entity24 , will angle its telescope to study " how solar material moves , gathers energy and heats up " in the chromosphere on its way to the outer atmosphere , the corona			1
" @entity21 will show the solar chromosphere in more detail than has ever been observed before , " @entity32 , deputy project scientist , said in a @entity5 article ahead of the launch			0
" my opinion is that we are bound to see something we did n't expect to see			0
" what causes the corona 's intense heat has been " a scientific mystery for more than 50 years , " according to @entity5 's @entity44 unit			0
information gathered by previous space missions suggests one source could be a magnetic field covering the sun 's surface , the unit says			2
scientists are also interested in the chromosphere because it generates most of the sun 's ultraviolet rays that affect @entity59 's climate			0
the data gathered by @entity21 , which stands for @entity21 , will add to the work of two other missions that will monitor the sun 's surface and outer atmosphere .			2

the @entity21 spacecraft will point a telescope at a little - studied area of the sun
the chromosphere sits between the sun 's surface and outer atmosphere
scientists want to understand how material moves and heats up in the zone
temperatures rise from *thousands* of degrees at the surface to millions farther out
