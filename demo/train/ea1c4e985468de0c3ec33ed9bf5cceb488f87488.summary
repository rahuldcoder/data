-- @entity1 has launched an overhaul and redesign of the struggling social media service in an attempt to bring users back and regain some momentum			1
this rollout incorporates three major changes for the site			1
the first is a redesign of the site based on user feedback			1
it places the key @entity1 topics -- gaming , technology , @entity19 , etc. -- at the top of the page rather than on the side			1
story pages have been cleaned up , and the " submit " box has been given more prominence			0
it now sits at the top of every page , while search has been been reduced to a magnifying glass icon that will display the search box when you click it			0
the second part of the update focuses on profile pages and the return of profile statistics			0
at the top right of every profile page are the @entity1 , commenting , submission and following stats for every user			2
@entity1 says it took " much longer " than expected to import the @entity1 data from @entity45 to the current version			2
it 's definitely incomplete , though -- my stats say i 've made zero submissions and zero comments in my many years on @entity1 , both of which are definitely not true			2
some data is still missing			0
finally , @entity1 has added a new slew of opt - in notifications for when your stories hit " @entity57			1
" while " @entity57 " has lost much of its prominence since " my news " was made the default , it 's still a point of achievement to have a story you submit reach the front page , so it makes sense that many people would want to be notified when that happens			0
these notifications will appear either by e-mail or on - site			2
the changes are designed to counteract @entity1 's painful decline by adding the most - requested user features			1
users famously revolted after the @entity1 launched last august			0
since then , @entity1 has been in decline , enough to force @entity1 to lay off more than one - third of its team			1
the new features will be rolled out over the next few weeks and will be offered at an opt - in basis			1
overall , they 're nice updates , but the company still has a long way to go to regain user trust and woo users back to its platform			0
every little bit counts , though , when you 're trying to turn things around			0
check out the before and after screenshots , and let us know what you think of the redesign in the comments below			0
