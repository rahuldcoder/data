@entity0 -- writing almost a century after the acts of @entity4 joined @entity5 with @entity6 , and 50 years since its @entity8 uprisings were brutally supressed , the bard @entity2 bemoaned the real reason behind his nation 's loss of independence : money and its ability to sway the vote			1
" the @entity6 steel we could disdain , secure in valor 's station ; but @entity6 gold has been our bane , such a parcel of rogues in a nation ! " two world wars and countless upheavals have come to pass since , with @entity5 standing valiantly -- if sometimes uneasily -- alongside the rest of the @entity29			1
yet one question has never ceased to prey upon its people 's psyche : would @entity5 be better off on its own ? and what would have happened had its own parliament , which @entity2 so bitterly berates , not condoned a merger between the two famous foes ? on 18 september , some 300 years after that fateful marriage , the people of @entity5 -- not @entity6 , @entity39 or @entity40 -- will finally have their chance to reverse that move in a ground - breaking referendum			1
and , once again , finances are likely to play a significant role			0
with a population less than a tenth the size of the @entity29 's and a gdp worth a quarter of a trillion dollars , @entity5 's inhabitants are relatively comfortable in comparison to many of their neighbors across the border			1
@entity5 enjoys its own legal and education systems , as well as more generous healthcare provisions than @entity6			0
it has its own parliament in @entity59 and @entity5 mps can represent their constituencies in @entity62 too , which in effect gives @entity5 two voices in one home nation			0
still , the ruling @entity66 believes that @entity5 should be separate ; that its foundations are not only sturdy enough to support an independent state , but also to nurture a new tiger economy in northern @entity70 , as @entity2 may well have enthused			0
how so ? because independence , the @entity66 argues , would give @entity5 leeway to cut taxes and to lift those in need out of poverty			0
it would reduce the country 's share of the @entity29 's debt burden and bring back skills and manufacturing eroded by @entity82 's deeply divisive policies there three decades ago			1
what 's more , with @entity29 often challenging its @entity70 neighbors on policy , @entity5 would like its own dialogue with the international community , saying it aims to join the @entity89 and @entity90 should independence be won			1
a noble cause for sure			0
but just like @entity2 's famous poetry , the plot is rich in idealism and light on practicalities , for many of @entity5 's pro-independence arguments are based on the assumption that it would be granted automatic membership to a few key clubs without having to wait in line			2
one is the @entity104 , the other the @entity4 , and neither is sending @entity5 a welcome message			0
@entity29 's chancellor recently ruled out allowing an independent @entity5 into a shared monetary union			1
this means that if the nation were to keep the pound as its currency , @entity5 would have no control over interest rates and no central bank to bail out its large financial services sector			0
and for those pro-independence @entity5 who thought adopting the euro could be a solution , @entity118 president @entity117 appears to have scotched those plans as well , asserting @entity5 would have to go through the whole rigmarole of @entity4 accession first and may find its path blocked by existing member states , fearful of their own separatist movements like @entity128			0
whether @entity117 is right , or as some former @entity4 officials have declared , wrong , the roadmap for @entity5 's independent state after a potential " yes " vote is so convoluted that some of the country 's biggest businesses have already begun to draw up contingency plans			2
@entity141 , with more funds under management than the size of @entity5 's entire economy , has become the first major firm to consider upping sticks and heading south should the sovereignty of its homeland be restored , in an action that could put 5,000 jobs under threat			2
@entity2 was right in saying gold was key to his country 's future			0
but today " black gold " also comes into the equation			0
after years of alleged shoddy stewardship of @entity5 's oil and gas reserves by @entity29 's central government , pro-independence campaigners reckon the country would be more effective at managing its own resources , keeping profits in a windfall fund that could be used to top up the budget where necessary			1
the @entity29 prime minister @entity163 , however , is adamant those offshore wells would be best served by the " broad shoulders " of @entity29 and to prove the point he 's committing money -- some 300 millions of dollars of it -- to recover 4 billion barrels lost in production			2
but let 's not cry over spilled oil for @entity5 ! there 's plenty at stake for the rest of the @entity29 should @entity5 choose to go it alone			1
and while the referendum has been presented as a binary choice , it 's not a zero - sum game			0
the dissolution of the @entity4 would have a profound effect on the both parties ' clout on the world stage at a time when the @entity4 is seeking a major free trade deal with the @entity189			0
as if to underline this very point , the @entity191 chancellor @entity190 chose to speak of the role '' a strong @entity29 '' should play in @entity70 in her state visit to the country			2
surrendering large swathes of @entity5 industry would make a mockery of @entity29 's plans to double its exports -- many of which coincidentally are headed for @entity191 -- to 1.6 trillion dollars by 2020 and throw businesses with branches on both sides of the boundary into disarray			1
so , if it 's fair to say pro-independence @entity5 are not too clear on why their realm would be more prosperous alone , why continue to fight for freedom ? @entity5 separatism has as much to do with protecting the region 's ancient cultural history and reviving auld allies as it does with managing the country 's books			2
and an independent @entity5 could affect the @entity29 's entire defense strategy , opening up an unpredictable flank at its northern extremity in the very place where @entity29 currently houses its nuclear deterrent			1
the web of interests , at times , seems so interminable and the complexities surrounding @entity5 's choice so hard to grasp that even the country 's own politicians are now weary of talking in hypotheticals , not to mention the 16 - year - olds who have been granted suffrage just in time			1
the truth is the fortunes of @entity5 and @entity6 are now woven together more tightly than the finest @entity234			0
and when it comes to @entity5 and its role within the @entity29 , it 's the trade ties that bind , even if the talk risks tearing them apart			1
more from @entity240 : @entity241 , the football fan mayor taking on @entity243 's elite more from @entity240 : is greed really good or will money be the end of us ?			2

one question has never ceased to prey upon the @entity5 people 's psyche : would the country be better off on its own ?
@entity240 *explores* the complex relationship between @entity5 and the rest of the @entity29
she finds that while @entity5 might want to split away , the complexities of such a move are extreme
