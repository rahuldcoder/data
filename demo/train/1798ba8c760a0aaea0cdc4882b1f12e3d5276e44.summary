@entity1 , @entity0 -- the most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend , as " @entity5 " opens worldwide			0
the @entity6 spoke to creator @entity7 and writer @entity8 in @entity1 about everyone 's favorite two - dimensional yellow family			1
@entity11 supremo @entity7 with his creations at the film 's premiere in @entity15 , @entity16 @entity7 told the @entity6 that fans had driven the demand for the movie			1
" we 've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years , " he said			1
the film has taken four years to come to fruition , as writer @entity8 explained			1
" what really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie , " he said			1
" we talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done , but the show is never done ! so it really started in earnest in 2003 , when we started working on this story that became the movie			1
" technology has also played its part			0
@entity8 continued , " the technology to do this film really was n't even around five years ago			1
for example , there was this joke i once pitched and @entity43 , the director , started drawing and as i was pitching it , it went into the film and it was cut a day later			0
to go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive			0
" its creators hope that " @entity5 " will both satisfy long - term fans and bring @entity50 and @entity52 's family to a new audience			2
@entity7 told the @entity6 , " this movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time , so there 's lots of little details for them in the movie , little characters and stuff who they know and love , but we also want people who do n't know the family to not be completely confused			1
it is a complete movie experience , but again , we have a lot of little details that only the really , true die - hard fans are going to get			1
" and fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps			0
@entity7 said , " when you see somebody fall off the roof in a live - action film , it 's funny -- we all love it			1
but it 's not as funny as when @entity50 falls off the roof			2
i do n't know what that says about humanity , but we do like to see cartoon characters hurt themselves and there 's quite a bit of that			2
" but how have @entity15 's finest led the field for so long ? @entity7 believes that a large part of the @entity11 ' success is down to the traditional animated techniques used to create it -- and that its hand - drawn charm puts the movie ahead of its @entity101 rivals			1
he told @entity2 , " the difference between our film and these other films is that we have no penguins , okay ? so that 's the big difference			2
( although we do have one penguin			0
) " but the other thing is , our film is done the old fashioned way			0
it 's got a lot of errors and flaws in it			2
these computer - animated films -- and i love them -- are perfect			2
they 're spooky , they 're so good			0
ours is a way for us to honor the art of traditional animation			2
" @entity8 thinks that the series ' success is also down to its wide appeal			1
he says , " i have a two year old and she loves the @entity11 already , just because of the way it looks and the family			2
and then on the other hand , we do satirical references that only an adult would get			2
" a large part of the appeal of " @entity11 " comes from its ability to portray the more touching moments in family life , like @entity8 's favorite moment in the movie			1
" it 's a scene where @entity144 is really mad at his father , " he told @entity2			0
" he 's sitting in a tree outside the @entity148 house at night			0
he looks over and sees the @entity150 house and thinks how wonderful it would be if he lived there			0
it 's just really sweet : there 's something really warm about that scene			0
" @entity7 , who has been meeting fans worldwide while promoting the movie , said that the @entity11 phenomenon has excelled his wildest dreams			1
" it 's not just the numbers , " he told @entity2			0
" the numbers are good , but it 's the intensity and the tattoos			0
you know ? and it 's not all just @entity144 and @entity50			0
you 'd think it would be just homer			0
i talked to this one guy and he had @entity173 , and i said , ' @entity174 , @entity173 ! ' and he said , ' yeah , everybody gets @entity144			0
' " while @entity7 never expected the series to run for so long , he told the @entity6 he has no plans to quit while it 's ahead			1
" the answer is , ' no end in sight ! no end in sight ! ' " he said			0
" we 're having fun , we hope the audience has fun , and as long as that 's true , we 'll continue doing the show			2
" @entity8 believes the show has proved it has longevity			1
" i 'm sure [ it ] , like @entity192 , will live on and on , " he said			0
and he also hopes the @entity11 ' success will continue			1
" in terms of new episodes , we 're doing another season after the movie comes out for sure , and then the casts ' contracts expire , but i 'd love to get another three seasons and maybe another movie , " he said			0
but what is the legacy of this much - loved yellow family ? @entity7 sees the film as the culmination of two decades of hard graft			1
he says , " i want to make sure that everyone who 's ever worked on this show is proud of their work on this movie , so this rewards the writers , the animators , the actors			1
it 's basically a celebration of twenty years of @entity11			1
