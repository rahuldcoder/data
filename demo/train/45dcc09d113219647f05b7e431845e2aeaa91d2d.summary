-- on may 27 , @entity1 gave birth to @entity3 with the help of her mother - in - law inside her home in @entity7 , a small village in eastern @entity8			2
but instead of joy and jubilation for the birth of her fifth child , the 28 - year - old mother was shocked : her newborn son had been born with four legs and four arms			0
the family rushed to a nearby district hospital for help but they were quickly referred to @entity21 in the @entity8 capital of @entity23			1
there , a team of doctors examined the infant and made the diagnosis of " parasitic twinning , " a variant of conjoint twinning in which one of the twins is not fully developed -- baby @entity28 had been born with a full set of arms and legs and another set from a headless and heartless mirror image twin that never fully grew			1
the @entity8 doctors ran a series of tests on the eight - limbed newborn which showed that the host and parasitic twin shared part of the pelvic bone			1
examinations of @entity28 's internal organs revealed further abnormalities : his heart was on the right side of his body , instead of the left , while his liver was on the left side as opposed to the right			0
after these initial investigations , @entity28 was discharged home for three months as the surgeons wanted to allow him to grow before performing an operation to separate the twins			0
finally , on august 18 , a @entity8 team of three surgeons , three anesthesiologists and two nurses successfully completed a three - hour operation to remove parts of the parasitic twin from the normal body			1
" the baby was given general anesthesia and the torso and trunk of the parasitic twin -- which had two arms but no head or heart -- was detached from the host baby , " said dr @entity73 , one of the surgeons who carried out the operation			1
" then we also detached the lower limbs of the parasitic twin from the host , which included disarticulating the right and left lower limbs as they were attached by joints			1
we controlled the bleeding and fashioned skin flaps to close the resulting wound , " he added			0
" there were no intra-operative or post-operative complications and mild blood loss and a precautionary blood transfusion was given			0
" three weeks after the surgery , the baby is progressing and breastfeeding well , according to the doctors			2
" the father and mother were very grateful because at first they thought it was due to witchcraft , and their baby was a laughing stock because of the abnormalities , " said @entity73			0
the incidence of conjoined twins is one in 50,000 , while parasitic twins are extremely rare			2
the condition is typically created after one of the twins stops developing at a certain point during the pregnancy , and the remnants of that twin merge with the twin that has continued developing			0
back in 2007 , an eight - limbed girl in @entity122 made global headlines after a team of 30 surgeons successfully completed a mammoth 27 - hour operation to remove her " parasitic twin			1
" for the doctors at @entity21 , this was the first time they had ever performed a surgery like this			2
" we have not had a prior experience with a parasitic twin but we work on many other children with multiple complex multi-organ congenital anomalies such as intestinal , urologic , cardiac , and orthopedic defects , " said @entity73			1
" although twinning is very rare worldwide , " he continued , " we have an increased incidence in @entity143 -- we [ have ] seen numerous sets of conjoint twins , five to six sets in the last few years			0
" @entity147 is still at the hospital and will remain there for the next two weeks , being treated by medics			2
looking ahead , doctors say that they " anticipate a healthy baby that may have a wide gait due to the large pelvic bone , and this may require orthopedic reconstruction in the future			0

boy born with multiple limbs is progressing well after operation to remove " parasitic twin "
the surgery took place at the @entity21 in @entity23 , @entity8
a parasitic twin is a conjoined twin that did not fully develop
the baby boy will remain in the hospital for two more weeks
