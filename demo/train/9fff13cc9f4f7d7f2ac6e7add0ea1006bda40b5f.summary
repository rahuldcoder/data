-- cycling can be the cruelest of sports and just when @entity5 's @entity4 was ready to celebrate a @entity7 stage win it was snatched away from him in an instant			1
out in front of the peloton for over 200km , @entity4 was desperately holding on to his lead as he approached the finishing line in @entity13 only for @entity14 of @entity15 to lead a surging group of sprinters past him			1
@entity14 took the victory , @entity4 could only finish 10th and with tears in his eyes			1
the @entity22 rider had been in the breakaway with @entity25 champion @entity24 and on the run from @entity27 built a lead of over eight minutes			0
but slowly it was whittled away and with a kilometer to go was down to just over 10 seconds			0
@entity4 was the stronger of the duo and made his run for the finish to be denied by @entity33 fast man @entity14 , who was claiming his second stage win of the @entity35			1
race leader @entity36 retained his four minutes 37 second advantage over @entity38 after an uneventful stage for the yellow jersey contenders following two days in the @entity41			1
it left the way clear for the sprinters but @entity4 looked set to spoil their day with his gallant but in the end fruitless effort			2
" it 's just bitter , bitter disappointment , " he told the official @entity7 website			2
" it 's a childhood dream to win a stage of the @entity35 and for a domestique , like myself , i 'm normally working for others			2
" this was my first chance to be up the road and with the chance in the wind and the weather , me and @entity24 realized we had a chance for the win			0
" i faked to be tired but felt i had more punch left			0
i left it until 400			0
i thought i had it but then i realized in the last 50m that i had nothing			0
@entity69 @entity68 finished second behind @entity14 , with green jersey holder @entity70 in third			1
monday is a rest day as the contenders take stock ahead of the challenge of the @entity76 and the only time trial of the race which may well decide the podium positions .			0
