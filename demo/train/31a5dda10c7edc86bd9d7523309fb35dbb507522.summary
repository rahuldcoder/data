for nearly two decades , ubiquitous access to the @entity1 has been the elusive dream of technologists , policymakers and ordinary users			1
but today , the prospect of worldwide , always - on and high - speed ( or close to it ) internet communications is in sight , and could become a reality within a decade			1
the @entity1 has become the essential communications medium of our time			1
for students , @entity1 access is as crucial as textbooks and blackboards			1
for workers , it 's hard to find a job , apply for public benefitsor participate in the global economy without basic connectivity			0
creative solutions to problems such as how to provide efficient health care now assume users will be connected to the @entity1 , whether they 're in an underserved neighborhood in @entity32 or a remote village in @entity34			1
that 's why achieving the goal of ubiquitous and affordable internet access is more important than ever			0
in many cases , internet access will grow naturally as increased demand and the economics of cheaper connectivity drive existing carriers and upstart providers to do more			0
but we also have to find new ways to deliver data			0
rather than relying on a single technical breakthrough , we 'll need a combination of solutions , from mobile broadband and low - cost diy infrastructure to far - out ideas such as drones and balloons			1
so , what 's on the menu ? fiber investment and undersea cables : we can expect to see more projects like @entity61 , which promises to deliver gigabit speeds at reasonable prices , and the construction of massive new undersea cables that dramatically increase the transmission capability of networks			1
cheap smartphones and mobile data plans : these will soon expand the @entity1 's footprint by billions of people , especially in parts of the world where wired networks have not been fully built out			1
cognitive radio technologies : these tools can turn unused and " junk " spectrum into wireless superhighways far more powerful than today 's @entity82 networks			0
converted pay phones , weather balloons and drones : engineers are looking at all of these as ways to bridge the " last mile " gap in hard - to - reach areas			2
with new technology and better use of the airwaves , it may soon be possible to blanket a rural area with high - speed wireless connections or enable a school to provide fast internet access to the surrounding community without digging up the streets			1
no matter the technology , a critical piece of this revolution will be the growth of community - driven infrastructure			2
communities are increasingly defining and building the next generation of internet deployment to promote access and affordability			0
long before @entity61 was deployed , @entity111 , @entity112 , built a gigabit fiber network for city residents and businesses to spur economic development and civic engagement			0
@entity118 and @entity119 may not compare favorably with @entity1 speeds in @entity121 and @entity122 , but cities like @entity111 and @entity124 , @entity125 , which have invested in public broadband networks , are increasingly competitive			1
communities from @entity128 to @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity32 are also building and operating their own open source , wireless communications infrastructure , customized to meet local needs			0
like the collectives that electrified rural areas of the @entity137 in the 1900s , it is a local , bottom - up approach -- supported by policy frameworks promoting flexibility and grassroots innovation -- that will be the key path to 21st century internet access			2
what 's more , these locally - controlled networks can improve governance , foster a greater sense of community inclusion and offer more secure communications and greater resilience in the event of disasters like @entity152			2
better public policies will expedite progress			0
so what should governments do ? podcast : make @entity1 everywhere a reality incentivize investment , encourage better use of spectrum , and allow local community build - out : sometimes , governments stand in the way			1
for example , 20 states in the @entity137 have laws that unbelievably ban cities from investing in their own public networks , prompting the @entity171 to consider removing these barriers			2
during the 2015 @entity174 , president @entity173 also urged the @entity171 to do so as part of his broader initiative to promote high - speed broadband investment			1
make more spectrum available for unlicensed and innovative uses that support super @entity82 and community networks : we need to more spectrum to support @entity137 ' ever - growing data consumption habit , but repurposing it all for exclusive use by cellphone carriers makes it harder for creative , local or unexpected solutions to connectivity challenges , which require access to the airwaves to succeed			1
keep costs down to help promote adoption : cost is a significant barrier to internet adoption around the world -- not to mention here in the @entity137 , where four out of five @entity137 who are n't online live below the poverty line -- which in turn slows down the virtuous cycle of infrastructure investment and innovation			2
policies that encourage broadband competition can help bring down the cost of connectivity , which will be a boon to underserved areas			0
anticipate new questions about free expression , governance , and individual choice : the next three billion netizens will come from widely varied political traditions			2
their governments may have different ideas about the free flow of information or personal privacy			0
clashes over internet control have garnered attention in @entity223 and @entity224 , but are also emerging around issues like hate speech and public safety from @entity228 to @entity229			0
as the network grows , critical governance questions become ever more important			0
the ingredients for universal connectivity exist today			0
but success requires the right mix of strategic investment , political will and laws that make creative approaches and local solutions possible			1
the promise of an internet for everyone wo n't be achieved by one genius , one company , or one policy initiative -- it will come from people and communities all over the world figuring out what works best for them , and knitting it all together .			0

prospect of worldwide , always - on and high - speed ( or close to it ) @entity1 could become a reality
success requires the right mix of strategic investment , political will , and laws that make creative approaches
