reactions to the drowning of nearly 400 migrants in the seas off @entity4 and @entity5 earlier this month demonstrate three important reasons why @entity7 will not resolve its immigration crisis any time soon			1
first , the polarization of public , media , and political reaction has been striking			0
for some these were humanitarian tragedies , made all the more harrowing by dramatic language about divers ' unpacking a wall of bodies ' in a trawler 's hull , and the @entity20 becoming a " watery graveyard			0
" for others in contrast they represent a failure of border security that jeopardizes the integrity of the @entity28 and is a harbinger for mass uncontrolled migration			1
@entity31 : how illegal immigrants enter the @entity28 the policy responses that flow from these conclusions are equally divided			1
there is a strong case to strengthen border controls			0
but an equally convincing argument is that more restrictive policies will only narrow options for desperate people and drive more of them into the arms of migrant smugglers and traffickers			0
the former is clearly the predominant view among most policy - makers in @entity7			2
friday 's summit of the @entity49 in @entity50 , while acknowledging the need to provide more development aid to some of the countries migrants are leaving , has mainly emphasized stepping up surveillance and sea patrols through the @entity28 's @entity59 border patrol agency			1
but experience around the world demonstrates that border control is not a silver bullet			0
a portfolio of policies is required to reduce irregular migration , certainly including border control , but combined with addressing the root causes of conflict and poverty , combating smuggling and trafficking , effective migration management and return , and the regulation of labor markets			0
second , the capsizing has also exposed deep divides within the @entity28			1
countries on the front - line -- especially @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity5 , and @entity84 -- are calling for the rest of @entity7 to share out the burden of asylum seekers and irregular migrants who arrive there by sea , by relocating some of them at least temporarily			1
but this challenges a fundamental @entity28 law , the @entity94 , which determines that dealing with asylum requests is the responsibility of the first @entity28 state through which asylum seekers pass			1
and countries like @entity99 , @entity100 , and the @entity101 , point out that they already receive the lion 's share of asylum applications in @entity7			2
as a result they have indicated a willingness to support capacity - building in states on the southern periphery , and to provide them limited financial assistance , but not to accept more migrants			2
opinion : @entity7 's immigration nightmare just beginning in the absence of a coordinated @entity28 approach , migrants -- and their smugglers -- will continue to target countries like @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 as entry points ; they will remain clandestine even if they may have a strong asylum claim ; they will continue to work in the informal labor market or turn to crime to survive ; and their rights will not be recognized or respected			1
third , the response to @entity4 in particular could be described as an over-reaction in this sense : at least 1,500 people drowned or went missing while attempting to reach @entity7 via the @entity20 in 2011 , according to the @entity129 the only unusual aspect is that large numbers died in the same incident in @entity4 , and that they drowned close to @entity7 shores			0
in other words while a one - off event has attracted attention , the systemic problem has been largely ignored			2
now that the funerals have taken place the deaths are fading from view , and the issue has become quickly sidelined			2
opinion : @entity28 must solve crisis to deserve @entity144 indeed the @entity145 has put off policy decisions on immigration to the forthcoming december 2013 and june 2014 summits			1
immigration has become a toxic political issue ; especially as high levels of unemployment and the economic crisis have fuelled a growing anti-immigration sentiment across @entity7			0
the downside of making policy on immigration in this environment strongly outweighs the upside			0
there is no political space to promote liberal policies on migration ; while politicians at least behind closed doors know that restrictive policies are unlikely to work			0
on friday @entity83 authorities reported that they have intercepted as many as 800 migrants on three separate boats in the @entity20			1
opinion : what 's the place of outsiders in @entity7 ? an acute crisis in @entity175 , from where many of those who drowned earlier this month and have been intercepted since came ; combines with chronic instability and poverty in many @entity181 countries , unpredictable transitions in @entity183 , and the unfolding @entity185 disaster , to translate into growing pressure on @entity7 's borders			2
in the not - too - distant future @entity189 's transition is likely to push even more people towards @entity7			0
and in the longer term disparities in development , demography , and democracy , as well as the effects of climate change , will drive still more migrants into @entity7			0
in the absence of a reasoned debate , a comprehensive policy response , a coordinated @entity28 approach , and the political courage to confront irregular migration , @entity7 's immigration nightmare has only just begun .			1

deaths of more than *300* migrants near @entity83 in early *october* put immigration in *spotlight*
tragedy has exposed deep divisions among @entity28 *leaders* about how to *prevent* next disaster
front - line countries want @entity28 *counterparts* to bear greater burden of asylum seekers
