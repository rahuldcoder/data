-- breaking four ribs in six years has turned out to be more than just bad luck for golfer @entity3			1
after another rib injury saw his early season form vanish , the @entity5 world no. 7 discovered he had a debilitating bone disease			1
" it 's something called low bone turnover , " @entity3 told @entity11			1
" for some reason my rib cage does n't generate the right amount of bone it should do			2
" it boils down to the fact that i have brittle ribs			1
i 'm now on medication to try and counteract it			0
it 's been helping a lot			0
" i have n't had any issues in the last few months and it 's nice to get that behind me and focus more on golf			2
" getting back on course , literally , will be a relief to @entity3 , who is targeting a big finish to the season in the @entity34 's @entity33 playoffs -- which start this week with the @entity35 at @entity36 in @entity37			1
after winning the @entity39 in february , the 32 - year - old was forced to take a month long break from the game			0
that hiatus interrupted what he considered to be a halcyon period on the golf course			0
" i played the best golf of my career in the first couple of months ( of the year ) , " @entity3 explained			1
" then i got injured and i had to fight my way back from that			0
" i 've had some glimpse of playing some great golf again but i have n't had the consistency i had at the beginning of the year -- hopefully i can get back to that , i 'm close			0
" getting back to his best saw @entity3 clinch a three - shot victory at the @entity59 at the end of july and climb to third in the @entity33 standings			1
@entity3 is the defending @entity33 champion and this week heads to @entity37 for the first of four playoffs			1
but with @entity64 , who has won five times this season , leading the tournament rankings from fellow @entity5 @entity68 , the golfer from @entity69 is under no illusions about his chances of becoming the first person to successfully defend the crown			1
" it 's going to be really , really tough , " said @entity3			2
" i 'm excited to be in a good position going into the playoffs but you never really know what 's going to happen until you get in the mix of it			0
" @entity64 is leading that race and he is going to be a formidable guy going into the final stretch			0
" but there are four tournaments and these are all great golf courses culminating at @entity87 in @entity88 and it should be a lot of fun			0
" the @entity33 sees player accrue ranking points throughout the season with the top 125 taking part in the first playoff			2
the field is whittled down with a final 70 players competing for the $ 10 million prize purse at the @entity99 in @entity88 in september .			0
