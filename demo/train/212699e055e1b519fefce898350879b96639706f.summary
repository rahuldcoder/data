-- the struggle for women 's rights against the backdrops of the @entity4 and democratic progress in @entity6 will be recognized by this year 's @entity7 on saturday , at a ceremony unlikely to repeat controversy seen last year			1
@entity11 president @entity10 , and @entity12 , a social worker and peace campaigner from the same country , will share the prize with @entity17 , an activist and journalist who this year played a key opposition role in @entity20			0
the three , chosen " for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women 's rights to full participation in peace - building work , " will be honored in @entity28 , @entity29 , during a program of events that culminates on sunday in a star - studded concert			1
all three will be interviewed by @entity0 's @entity34 , a veteran of @entity7 ceremonies , shortly after they receive their medals and $ 1.5 million in cash			1
the interviews and concert , hosted by actors @entity41 and @entity42 , will be broadcast live online and mobile on @entity0			1
acts performing at the concert include @entity47 , @entity48 , rock band @entity49 and country duo @entity50			0
@entity10 , a 73 - year - old @entity52 graduate whose political resilience has earned her the nickname " @entity56 , " became @entity6 's first democratically - elected female president in 2006 , three years after decades of civil war ended			0
crediting women with ending the conflict and challenging the dictatorship of former president @entity62 , she declared a zero - tolerance policy against corruption and made education compulsory and free for all primary - age children			0
@entity12 , 39 , led a women 's movement that protested the use of rape and child soldiers in @entity11 's civil war			1

read more about this year 's @entity7 winners although @entity17 , 32 , emerged as an icon of change as @entity20 was swept up in the tumult of the @entity4 , the mother - of - three has long been active in campaigning for women and human rights			1
@entity17 , the first @entity86 woman to win the @entity7 -- and one of its youngest recipients -- founded the rights group women journalists without @entity92 , and emerged as a key figure in protests against president @entity96 's regime			1
while @entity10 's @entity98 achievement has stirred anger among @entity11 political opponents who claim recent elections were rigged in her favour , this year 's @entity7 is unlikely to attract the level of controversy seen in 2010			2
@entity105 and more than a dozen other countries , including @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , boycotted the event over the decision to award the prize to @entity105 dissident @entity113 , a key figure in the 1989 @entity116 protests			0
read more about the @entity7 @entity113 , who is serving an 11 - year - sentence in a @entity105 prison for what the government called " inciting subversion of state power , " was not allowed to travel to @entity29 to accept the prize , which @entity105 denounced as a " political farce			2
" awarded almost every year since 1901 ( it has been halted during times of major international conflict ) the @entity7 has a history of contentious laureates			2
previous winners include former @entity131 secretary of state @entity130 , who won alongside @entity133 revolutionary @entity132 ( who declined the award ) , and the late @entity136 leader @entity135 , who won jointly with @entity138 president @entity137 and former @entity138 prime minister @entity139			2
in 2009 , the prize was awarded to @entity131 president @entity141 despite the fact he had spent less than one year in office			0
two years earlier , former @entity131 vice president @entity144 was a joint recipient in recognition of work highlighting climate change			0
â € ¢ just hours after officially receiving the @entity7 , this year 's three co-laureates sit down with @entity34 for an hour - long special interview			2
