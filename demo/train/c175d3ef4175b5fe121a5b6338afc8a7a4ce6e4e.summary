@entity0 , @entity1 -- can @entity3 make innovation work in @entity1 ? @entity3 is the former president of @entity5 in @entity1 who left the internet search giant last fall just months before the company 's high profile scuffle with the @entity1 government over censorship rules and alleged hacker attacks			1
that furor raised @entity3 's international profile , but the 48 - year - old is now fully focused on the future , hoping to inject a new spirit of innovation into @entity1 business with his investment and incubation company innovation works			1
" people expect @entity21 to be magical , " said @entity3 during an interview with @entity2 in june at his company 's offices , located just across the street from @entity5 's @entity1 headquarters			1
" the great anticipation outside of @entity21 is both a pressure for us as well as something that excites people			0
i want to make a plea for people not to expect miracles			0
" that pressure comes as @entity3 has a good track record in the @entity35 and a reputation , especially among young @entity1 , as a business role model			1
originally from @entity38 , @entity3 studied computer science at @entity40 in @entity41 and later earned a doctorate in the same field from @entity45 's @entity44 where he was also a lecturer			2
he then worked for @entity46 and moved to @entity1 in 1998 to head up @entity48 's @entity47 in @entity0			1
in 2005 , he joined @entity5 to lead the company 's operations in @entity1			1
while @entity5 's share of the @entity1 search market increased from nearly nothing to around 30 percent under @entity3 's watch , some questioned his leadership skills and whether his exit was influenced by an early knowledge that @entity5 would announce in january potential plans to close its @entity1 operations			1
" i do n't think he should be held responsible for the existing circumstances of @entity5 in @entity1 , " said @entity61 , a @entity0 - based tech blogger who traveled with @entity3 to @entity5 's @entity62 , @entity63 , headquarters in 2006			1
" if there 's blame , @entity5 's choice to enter the @entity1 market might have just been a mistake from the very beginning			1
" even so , @entity3 's legacy with @entity5 is one that remains with him today and wo n't fade anytime soon			1
however he 's reluctant to talk about his former employer			0
" i can never please any audiences with what i have to say [ about @entity5 ] , " @entity3 told @entity2			2
" so , i would rather not talk about it			0
" instead @entity3 would rather talk about is his efforts to foster a mentality that values long - term success rather than instant riches and the need to reform a @entity1 education system that focuses on rote memorization over individualistic , out - of - the - box thinking			1
in addition to the four books @entity3 has authored on such subjects , he also regularly lectures at @entity1 universities and has become something of a mentor to many students			2
" i have had a certain impact at @entity48 and @entity5 , but the larger impact have been the lectures and the books , " @entity3 said			1
" i do n't think i have been particularly profound , but i think people need guidance and mentorship at a very confusing time			0
" @entity3 and his staff offer young @entity1 entrepreneurs , engineers and project managers financial support and guidance to help them build companies and launch products for @entity1 's 400 million internet users and 700 million mobile subscribers			1
since @entity21 was launched , it has received 100,000 resumes , reviewed 500 business plans and amassed around $ 115 million in funds from investors , @entity3 said			2
today , it has 200 staff members and is incubating 12 start - ups , five of which @entity3 unveiled to journalists earlier this week during a tour of a new office space the investment company will move into later this month			1
he also unveiled five of the companies @entity21 are supporting and the products they are developing for the @entity1 market			2
the projects , heavily focused towards mobile internet , e-commerce and cloud computing , included an @entity131 operating system called tapas with features tailored for @entity1 handset users			0
" an early stage entrepreneur who wants to build up companies will face a lot of trouble in @entity1 , " @entity3 told reporters			2
" it is not as good as it seems			0
even though you hear a lot about the start - up world being wonderful , they face a lot of trouble			2
" some investors question whether @entity3 , who has never been an entrepreneur himself , has what it takes to help new companies succeed			0
" a common perception is he is @entity5 and he is a professional manager and pretty much has been his entire life and never really run a start - up before and never done investing before , " said an investor who declined to be identified due to his firm 's interest the companies @entity21 is incubating			1
" it is going to be tough for him			0
" others are concerned the start - ups @entity3 is coaching may not be able to survive in the harsh business climate of @entity1 where many deals are won under - the - table and profits are sometimes earned in down - and - dirty ways			1
" i do n't think they can take the low ground because they have the burden to always be taking the higher ground , " said another investor who also declined to be identified			0
" most businesses in @entity1 make money doing business in gray areas or crossing lines			0
[ innovation works ] will always have to take the higher ground , which means they may never be making as much money as competitors			0
" i think it will be innovation at work , which is not @entity21			0
but we have to give @entity3 the benefit of the doubt			0
" yet for @entity3 , the benefits he says @entity190 is imparting to young entrepreneurs is far more important than the doubts anyone may have about him , the company and the success it may or may not have beyond its offices here in @entity0			2
" even if our result is not brilliant , or it is not changing the world , i am very certain the people who come out of here will be better people because of what we have done , " he said			0
" i do think in the end it is the result that will tell the story			0
