-- if you discovered water that could be millions or billions of years old , would you taste it ? @entity3 does it all the time			1
she 's a geologist in the department of @entity6 at the @entity7 , and collaborated with other researchers on analyzing water found in a @entity11 mine in @entity12 , @entity13			1
they published the findings in the journal nature in may , showing that the water is between 1.5 and 2.6 billion years old -- meaning it has been totally isolated for that long			1
@entity3 dipped the tip of her finger in this water and tested it with her tongue			1
she found the ancient sample " very salty and bitter -- much saltier than seawater			2
" but while this may sound horrifying , geologists often use their own senses in sampling , she said			0
it 's not just for fun : they 're working in dark environments with multiple fractures of water , and they know the waters they want to analyze further are the saltiest , as they 're likely to be the oldest			2
" if you 're a geologist who works with rocks , you 've probably licked a lot of rocks , " she said			2
ancient water found in @entity11 mine it takes more than a taste test to figure out how old water is , however			1
" we can get a sense of antiquity by looking at things like salinity of the water , and more particularly , looking at oxygen and hydrogen in the water molecule itself , " she said			2
scientists looked at the amounts of noble gases in the water -- helium is one , for example -- and which isotopes were present			2
these are signatures of the approximate age of water			2
this research has implications for what life may exist on other planets			2
" equally on somewhere like @entity83 , any life that formed could have found its way into similar pockets of water in the @entity83 crust , and our work shows that these pockets of water can survive and provide a place for the life to have survived long after the surface of @entity83 lost its water and became sterile , " said @entity75 , professor of geochemistry at the @entity77 in the @entity78 and senior author on the study , said in an e-mail			1
miners have known about the presence of deep salty waters for some time in @entity11 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
mining literature even mentions it in the 1880s -- but it flew under the radar of scientists until recently			0
at a different @entity11 mine , @entity3 and colleagues went to investigate these waters			1
they discovered that the chemistry was similar to the kinds of waters found in hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean			0
they also saw that the high salinity of these waters was a result of the chemical reactions going on between the rocks and the water			0
" this results in water that 's full of the kind of energy that can support life , " she said			1
in a @entity100 gold mine , @entity3 and colleagues found microbial communities at 1.7 miles deep , living off of dissolved hydrogen in these waters			1
the waters themselves on the order of tens of millions of years old			0
that work inspired them to return to @entity11 , to the @entity12 mine , because they theorized that even older waters might flow there , based on the age and geology of the rocks			0
down in the mine , it 's " dark , dusty , very noisy and hot , " @entity75 said			0
the ancient water found there is a natural phenomenon ; it 's not there because of the mines			1
" it 's just that the mines allow us to get down there and get at them , " @entity3 said			1
" they 're our equivalent of the deep sea submarines			0
" the waters themselves are flowing , bubbling out of fractures in the rock , or boreholes that intersect with the fractures			0
the next step is to estimate the age of other deep waters all over the planet , so that they can compare and contrast what they may find in terms of life that lives far underground in these packets of water			1
they are still in the process of looking for life in the samples from the @entity12 mine ; working up this data is " painstaking work , " she said			0
@entity75 said the water is not drinkable , but admitted , " the water is crystal clear when it first comes out of the rock and looks very tempting			0
" @entity3 is quick to deny full - on drinking these ancient waters -- she 's literally just talking about putting the tip of her finger to the tip of her tongue			1
" it 's scientifically too valuable to waste like that , " she said			0

@entity3 is a geologist studying ancient water in mines
water that she and her colleagues analyzed may be 2.6 billion years old
they are investigating the *possibility* that the water hosts microbial life
