@entity0 -- the @entity2 on thursday passed a giant defense bill that includes a new policy for detaining and trying suspected @entity6 terrorists -- a policy that attracted controversy during the debate and may draw a presidential veto			1
the defense authorization bill passed by a vote of 93 - 7			1
in keeping with budget cuts across the government , the $ 662 billion bill shrinks @entity16 spending by $ 43 billion from last year			1
it includes funding for the wars in @entity20 and @entity21 and sets policies for the various weapons systems and personnel programs at the @entity16			2
@entity2 debate on the detainee matter was at times volatile and emotional			0
after years of struggling with issues of who should investigate , detain and try suspected terrorists -- civilian authorities and courts or the military and its tribunal system -- @entity35 chair @entity34 , @entity36 , and ranking @entity38 @entity37 of @entity39 reached a long - sought compromise to codify the process			1
however , critics complained the deal was weighted toward the military because it required any suspected @entity6 terrorists , even those captured inside the @entity47 , to be held potentially indefinitely by the military			1
that concerned the @entity50 and many lawmakers who think the responsibility belongs , in part , to law enforcement agencies and the federal courts and warned that @entity47 could possibly be detained indefinitely by the military			2
@entity34 and @entity37 denied their bill would allow for the indefinite detention of @entity47 citizens			1
" this country is special because we have certain values , and due process of law is one of those values , " @entity62 chairwoman @entity61 , @entity63 , argued on the @entity2 floor			0
" i object to holding @entity47 citizens without trial			2
i do not believe that makes us more safe			0
" " you have people on the left who hate saying ' the war on terror , ' " responded sen. @entity75 , @entity77 - @entity76			0
" they would never ever use the military and always insist the law enforcement be used because they do n't buy into the idea that we 're at war			0
they want to criminalize the war			0
" senators ultimately reached an agreement to amend the bill to make clear it 's not the bill 's intent to allow for the indefinite detention of @entity47 citizens and others legally residing in the country			1
" it would provide the assurance that we are not adversely affecting the rights of @entity47 citizens in this language , " @entity34 said while expressing support for the compromise			1
" it supports present law , " @entity61 added			0
senators from both parties also challenged the @entity113 administration 's policies toward @entity114 , unanimously approving an amendment insisting on tough new sanctions against @entity114 's @entity117 and entities that do business with it			0
senators want to punish @entity114 over its pursuit of a nuclear weapons programs and the recent storming of the @entity123 in @entity124			0
the administration complained the @entity2 amendment would make it difficult for the @entity50 to manage a delicate foreign policy matter			2
also thursday , the @entity2 approved on a voice vote a @entity131 amendment requiring president @entity113 to develop a plan to expedite the troop withdrawal from @entity21 , which is scheduled to be completed in 2014			2
while it 's not clear the amendment will force any actual acceleration of the withdrawal , sen. @entity134 , @entity135 , said the @entity2 vote was a " message " to the president that @entity47 troops have successfully performed their mission of stamping out @entity6 and the 9 - 11 terrorists and " it 's time to bring our men and women home			1
" the measure still needs to go to conference for reconciliation with the @entity50 version of the bill .			0
