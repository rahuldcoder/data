-- @entity1 lost her husband in the 9/11 terrorist attacks , and she does n't understand why knives would be allowed in airplane cabins 12 years later			1
@entity6 does n't think box cutters killed her husband @entity8 , who was working at the @entity9 when airliners crashed into the towers			0
" the planes flying into the buildings is what killed my husband , " said @entity6 , an author and the first executive director of families of september 11			0
but she does n't think people need knives on airplanes			1
" i am aware of the argument that anything can be made into a weapon , but knives make it easy , " @entity6 said			1
the @entity27 's announcement last week that pocket knives and other previously prohibited items will be allowed in airline cabins starting in april has sparked an outcry among many concerned travelers , lawmakers and aviation professionals			1
the new rules wo n't ease screening for passengers , some say , while adding an unnecessary threat to the safety of airline crews and passengers			1
" the rules are so enormously confusing for the passenger and so arbitrarily applied , " said @entity6			0
" they 're not really making it more convenient because you can bring a knife but you still have to take off your shoes -- unless you 're a senior ? " many travelers echo that sense of confusion			0
on @entity55 , a user called @entity54 poses this question : " so u can bring a knife on the plane but u ca n't have too much toothpaste or shampoo ? " under the new rules , knives with blades that are 2.36 inches ( 6 centimeters ) or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place			1
razor blades and box cutters are still prohibited			0
the rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry - on luggage			1
@entity79 , the airline trade association , said monday " additional discussion is warranted " before small knives are allowed on planes			1
sen. @entity83 called on sunday for the @entity27 to reverse the rule change			1
" these items are dangerous , and have not become less so in the years since they were banned from planes , " the @entity86 @entity85 said			0
@entity89 ' ceo @entity88 said in a letter to the @entity27 that the move would add little value in terms of passenger screening efficiency " in relation to the additional risk for our cabin staff and customers			1
" despite opposition , @entity27 chief @entity100 said the changes will bring the @entity103 into alignment with international rules and are in keeping with a " risk - based security " approach that will allow screeners to focus on items such as liquid explosives and improvised bombs that pose a greater threat to aircraft			1
@entity27 spokesman @entity114 reiterated to @entity0 monday that the rules would go into effect on april 25 , as scheduled			0
@entity117 is expected to defend his decision thursday when he attends a pre-scheduled hearing of the @entity120			0
a threat assessment determined that allowing small knives in cabins would not result in catastrophic damage to aircraft , the agency said			1
but after consulting with @entity128 leaders , the @entity27 opted to continue excluding knives that most closely resemble weapons , specifically knives with blades that lock in place , or have molded hand grips			1
@entity100 also decided to keep box cutters and razor blades on the prohibited items list because of their " emotional " connection with the september 11 , 2001 , said @entity114			0
that did n't matter to travelers @entity140 and @entity141 , both 26 , visiting @entity142 from @entity143			0
" a knife is a knife , " said @entity140			0
" why bring confusion ? " " no knives , no confusion , " said @entity141			1
risk - based approach the @entity27 's moves toward a risk - based approach to security have the support of rep. @entity153 , @entity154 , chairman of the @entity120			1
" @entity27 must continue to improve its risk - based screening and one of its highest priorities must be securing commercial aviation from the type of threats and weapons that could bring down an aircraft			1
any modifications to our security system must enhance our ability to detect such threats			1
as i have stated , my priority is to make @entity27 more passenger - friendly and threat - focused			0
" and former @entity27 chief @entity172 supports the change			1
sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft , @entity172 said , and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can threaten aircraft , he said			2
" small non-locking blades are not very practical killing weapons , as screwed up as the @entity27 is , i 'm on their side on this one , " wrote a reader with the handle @entity183			2
" stop harassing people about the little stuff and concentrate on the real stuff that can do serious harm			0
" security expert @entity192 said the @entity27 should focus on risky people rather than risky objects			0
opinion : is the @entity27 serious ? " when you have someone like you or me who does n't intend to attack a flight , whether we have a @entity209 knife in our pocket or not does n't make any difference , " said @entity192 , president of @entity197 - based @entity196 and former head of security of @entity200 near @entity201 , @entity202			0
" if you have somebody like one of the terrorists ( who was involved in the 9/11 attacks ) or a terrorist who is still out there , i 'm not sure we 'd want him to have even a @entity209 knife , " @entity192 said			2
" risk is not measured by the item , whether it is a knife or gun			2
it is measured by the person holding it			0
a bad guy with a @entity209 knife can still cause a lot of damage to the crew and passengers in the cabin before the aircraft can land			2
" rep. @entity237 joins chorus of those against letting knives on planes that potential for violence is part of what has flight attendants concerned			2
former flight attendant @entity248 is " stupefied " by the move , " especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes , liquids and computers -- remains unchanged , " she wrote in an opinion column for @entity0			0
and @entity257 , president of the @entity258 , said the move is " completely unnecessary " and " makes no sense			2
" rather than freeing up time , she predicted that security officers will get more bogged down testing and measuring the knives to see if they meet the criteria			1
the @entity266 , representing nearly 90,000 flight attendants , and the @entity268 ( @entity268 ) , which represents 22,000 airline pilots , also oppose the rule change			1
by monday afternoon , more than 20,000 people had signed a petition to @entity273 calling on the @entity27 to keep knives off of planes			2
traveler @entity276 , a writer and blogger in @entity278 , sees " the flip - floppiness " of the @entity27 's policies as the real problem			2
" there are too many rules to follow and there also does n't seem to be much rhyme or reason			0
" many travelers see rules that have n't been eased as bigger hurdles to the air travel experience : " i would prefer they get rid of the liquid restrictions			0
i 'll leave my penknife at home , " wrote a @entity0 reader			0
" but trying to find 3 oz bottles of everything and stuff them all into a quart baggie is a royal pain			0
" knives on a plane ? really ? @entity0 's @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 contributed to this report .			2

@entity309 still heated a week after a rule was announced to allow knives in airplane cabins
a 9/11 widow said allowing knives makes *accessing* weapons " easy "
@entity89 ceo sees little benefit to a change that poses " additional risk " to staff and passengers
supporters say allowing knives will give screeners more time to address larger threats
