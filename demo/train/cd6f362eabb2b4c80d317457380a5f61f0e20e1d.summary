covert drone strikes are one of president @entity3 's key national security policies			1
he has already authorized 283 strikes in @entity6 , six times more than the number during president @entity8 's eight years in office			2
as a result , the number of estimated deaths from the @entity3 administration 's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the @entity8 administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618			1
under @entity3 , the drone campaign , which during the @entity8 administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of @entity21 , has undergone a quiet and unheralded shift to focus increasingly on killing @entity24 foot soldiers			1
@entity3 revealed : the man , the president to the extent that the targets of drone attacks can be ascertained , under @entity8 , @entity21 members accounted for 25 % of all drone targets compared to 40 % for @entity24 targets			1
under @entity3 , only 8 % of targets were @entity21 compared to just over 50 % for @entity24 targets			2
and while under @entity8 , about a third of all drone strikes killed a militant leader , compared to less than 13 % since president @entity3 took office , according to an analysis of thousands of credible media reports about the strikes undertaken by the @entity41			2
while @entity8 sought to decapitate the leadership ranks of @entity21 , @entity3 seems to be aiming also to collapse the entire network of allied groups , such as the @entity6 @entity24			1
as a result , so - called " signature strikes " have become a hallmark of @entity3 's drone war			1
these are drone attacks based on patterns of merely suspicious activity by a group of men , rather than the identification of a particular individual militant			2
these have decimated the ranks of low - level combatants , killing somewhere between 1,332 to 2,326 reported militants			0
in april 2010 , a militant told a @entity62 reporter , " it seems they really want to kill everyone , not just the leaders			0
" @entity3 's drone campaign is quite controversial : some claim that a substantial number of civilians are killed in the attacks , while @entity73 government officials assert that the civilian casualty rate is now zero			1
in @entity6 , the program is deeply unpopular and the @entity6 parliament voted in april to end any authorization for the program , a vote that the @entity73 government has simply ignored			0
the @entity41 analysis of the drone campaign in @entity6 found that : -- the civilian casualty rate has been dropping sharply since 2008			2
the number of civilians , plus " unknowns , " those individuals whose precise status could not be determined from media reports , reported killed by drones in @entity6 during @entity3 's tenure in office were 11 % of fatalities			1
so far in 2012 it is close to 2 %			0
under president @entity8 it was 33 %			0
-- conversely , the percentage of militants killed has been rising over the life of the drone program			0
the number of militants reported killed by drone strikes is 89 % of the fatalities under @entity3 compared to 67 % under @entity8			1
-- some of these attacks were designed to help @entity6 interests			0
in the first eight months of 2009 , the @entity73 carried out 19 drone strikes targeting affiliates of the leader of the @entity6 @entity24 , @entity111 , who had carried out an extensive campaign of attacks against @entity6 police officers , soldiers and politicians			1
@entity111 was eventually killed by a @entity119 drone strike			0
-- since it began in 2004 , the drone campaign has killed 49 militant leaders whose deaths have been confirmed by at least two credible news sources			2
while this represents a significant blow to the militant chain of command , these 49 deaths account for only 2 % of all drone - related fatalities			0
@entity130 himself recognized the devastation that the drones were inflicting on his organization , writing a lengthy memo about the issue in october 2010 that was later recovered in the compound in @entity138 , @entity6 , where he was killed by a team of @entity141			0
in the memo to a lieutenant , @entity130 advised that his men leave the @entity6 tribal regions where the drone strikes have been overwhelmingly concentrated and head to a remote part of @entity149 and he also suggested that his son @entity150 decamp for the tiny , rich @entity152 kingdom of @entity153			1
buzz ramps up over @entity141 's @entity130 book the year 2010 marked the most intense point of the @entity3 drone campaign , with a record 122 strikes			1
this combined with the may 2011 raid on @entity130 's compound in @entity138 , and the killing of at least 24 @entity6 soldiers in a @entity165 air strike in november severely damaged the relationship between the @entity73 and @entity6 , and resulted in the eviction of @entity119 - controlled drones from @entity170 air base in @entity171 in southwestern @entity6			0
at the same time , @entity172 , then - @entity73 ambassador to @entity6 , was urging that there be more judicious targeting of the drone strikes as well as increased consultation with the @entity6 about them			2
in the past two years , there has also been increased congressional oversight of the program			0
the chairwoman of the @entity181 , sen. @entity182 , @entity183 , explained in a may letter to the @entity185 that " @entity181 staff has held 28 monthly in - depth oversight meetings to review strike records and question every aspect of the program including legality , effectiveness , precision , foreign policy implications and the care taken to minimize noncombatant casualties			0
" some combination of pushback from the @entity200 , increased congressional oversight , the closure of the @entity119 drone base in @entity6 and , perhaps , a declining number of targets in the tribal regions and a greater desire to heed @entity6 sensitivities about drone attacks has led to a sharp fall in the number of strikes since 2010			2
the number of drone strikes in 2011 fell by 40 % from the record number of strikes in 2010			0
so far this year , the number of strikes has dropped by a further 25 %			0
this is a welcome development			0
if the price of the drone campaign that increasingly kills only low - level @entity24 is alienating 180 million @entity6 -- that is too high a price to pay			1
while the drone campaign in @entity6 may be on the wane , it is amping up against the @entity21 affiliate in @entity227			1
this year alone , @entity3 has authorized around 30 drone strikes in @entity227 , while @entity8 only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office			1
small wonder that as @entity3 prepares to address the @entity235 convention in @entity236 , @entity237 , he continues to enjoy a considerable advantage over @entity239 on national security			1
a @entity242 poll in august found @entity3 leading @entity239 by a comfortable 12 percentage points on national security , which is traditionally regarded as a @entity246 strength			1
thanks to @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 for their research help			0

@entity255 : @entity3 's drone campaign shifts to @entity24 militants , not @entity21 leaders
@entity260 : @entity3 has *stepped* - up drone attacks as a key part of national security policy
drone strikes deeply resented in @entity6 , he says , but campaign there is waning
@entity227 in the sights now , he says , as @entity3 ahead of @entity239 on national security
