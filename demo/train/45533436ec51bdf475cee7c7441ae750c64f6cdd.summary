-- whisper it quietly in @entity2 but a trio of @entity5 - speaking riders is set to dominate the 99th edition of its most famous sports event , a bike race that represents the @entity12 nation 's very essence			1
winding across the flatlands of northern @entity2 and over the cols of the @entity15 and the @entity16 , before finishing on the @entity17 in @entity18 on july 22 , the @entity19 is watched by millions of spectators during its three weeks and literally brings the country to a standstill			2
the possible success of @entity25 's " @entity29 " cyclists , and that their main challengers will come from @entity27 and @entity28 , is a further sign of the globalization of a sport once dominated by riders from @entity2 and northern @entity35 neighbors such as @entity36 and the @entity37 , plus @entity38 and @entity39			2
between 1999 and 2005 seven straight wins for @entity42 @entity41 threw a spanner in the spokes of the @entity19 's traditional powerbrokers , and the trend has continued apace			2
@entity41 banned from world @entity49 events over doping probe a 32 - year - old @entity52 , @entity53 is the favorite for overall victory in 2012 , with his main opposition likely to come from @entity27 @entity57 , who triumphed last year , while @entity28 @entity58 has a good chance of a podium place			1
" i think it 's great because cycling used to be a @entity35 sport and now we see @entity27 riders , @entity69 and the @entity25 coming forward , " @entity61 , the cycling editor of @entity62 , the @entity2 sports newspaper so closely associated with the @entity19 , told @entity0 ahead of the race 's start on saturday			1
" within a few more years i believe we will even see a rider from @entity71 challenging for major jerseys			0
but for us the favorite is @entity53			1
" impeccable credentials @entity75 , a surprising fourth in the @entity19 , will start with impeccable credentials			1
he is the first man to win the @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 stage races in the same season			0
an in - form @entity75 crashed out early in the @entity83 and is thus doubly determined to seize the chance to cement his place in cycling 's hall of fame			1
" i 've been waiting for this moment for a long time and i 'll do everything i can to win the @entity19 , " @entity75 told @entity90 's official website			1
" the team 's preparation has been perfectly managed and our form this season gives us a great chance of being successful			0
" @entity57 became the first @entity27 to win the @entity19 in 2011 and the 36 - year - old @entity101 leader will not give up his crown without an almighty fight			1
" we 're bringing an even stronger team to the @entity19 this year and the route would seem to favor me , " he told his team 's official website			2
modal shift throw into the mix @entity58 , who won last month 's @entity111 , and it is clear there has been a modal shift in cycling supremacy			0
" we could have a @entity19 podium with three native @entity5 - speaking riders , " @entity58 's team boss at @entity117 , @entity118 , told @entity0			1
@entity121 is talking up the chances of his 31 - year - old star rider , despite recent @entity111 winners flopping in the @entity19 just a few weeks later			1
" @entity58 will break that historical trend			0
whether he can win the tour is hard to say , but he will be a contender , " said @entity118			0
the cause of the @entity5 speakers has been helped by the absence from the @entity126 of two riders who may well have had a say in the eventual outcome			0
@entity134 's @entity133 and @entity135 of @entity39 fought a classic duel on the slopes of the @entity138 in the 2010 edition			0
@entity135 emerged a narrow victor overall , but was later stripped of the title after failing a doping test during the race			0
@entity133 was awarded the race retrospectively , but his hopes of winning a second tour were dashed when he withdrew after suffering injuries in a fall at the @entity149 race won by @entity75 earlier this year			1
@entity135 ban @entity135 is still serving a ban as a result of his 2010 misdemeanors and will return in august			0
the specter of drugs still casts a shadow over cycling , and in the buildup to the @entity19 the @entity159 ( @entity159 ) formally charged @entity41 over allegations of doping			2
@entity118 , whose team adopts a strict anti-doping stance , is hoping that the increased globalization of the sport -- and with it the opportunity for more sponsorship revenue to boost its coffers -- will play a part in eradicating doping			0
" we need all our cyclists to be properly compensated for the incredible physical risks they take every day , " he said			0
a glimpse at the route for this year 's tour shows just how exacting a test the 21 - stage race really is for the 198 starters from 22 teams			2
the 3,497 - kilometer race will take in 25 categorized climbs in the @entity16 and @entity15 , but with 100 km of individual racing against the clock , starting with 6.4 km in the prologue in @entity186 in @entity36 , it favors @entity75 and @entity57			1
away from the battle for yellow , @entity187 , who joined @entity75 at the powerful and well - funded @entity90 for 2012 , will be defending the maillot vert ( green jersey ) of the points winner as he bids to add to his fast mounting tally of 20 stage victories in the @entity19			1
dangerous finishes on the nine flat stages , @entity187 and his sprinter colleagues will get their opportunity to cross the line first in the usual hell for leather and often dangerous finishes			2
reigning world champion @entity187 is the leader of that pack and warmed up with three more victories in the @entity111			0
but given his @entity207 aspirations -- the road race at the @entity205 is just a week after the finish of the @entity19 -- @entity61 believes he will not seriously defend his green jersey			1
" he will win perhaps three or four stages , but not green , " said @entity61			0
the team principal at @entity90 , @entity213 , admits they have split loyalties			0
" our priority this year is the general classification with @entity53 but that does n't mean we 'll neglect the sprint stages , or @entity187 's bid for green jersey , " said @entity213			1
if the main contenders for yellow slip up , @entity38 @entity225 of @entity226 , who won the 2010 @entity227 , and @entity36 @entity228 of @entity229 -- a top - five finisher at @entity19 that same year -- are ready to step up			1
home hopes and what of @entity2 chances in their home @entity19 ? last year @entity235 held on to the yellow jersey for 10 days , won the admiration of cycling fans everywhere and finished fourth overall behind @entity57			1
" the biggest hope for us is that another rider can do the same as @entity235 , " admitted @entity61 , who singled out @entity240 , winner of the white jersey last year for best under - 25 rider , for a possible high finish			2
but all the momentum seems to be with @entity75 , the first genuine @entity25 contender for overall victory since @entity250 in the 1960s			0
@entity252 became the first @entity25 rider to claim the race leader 's yellow jersey in 1962 and his achievements paved the way for @entity5 - speaking competitors in a sport entirely dominated by @entity35			2
but five years later he died on @entity261 on the 13th stage of the @entity19 -- the victim of heat exhaustion and a deadly cocktail of drugs and alcohol --- in a doomed and tragic bid for cycling 's ultimate prize			0
@entity252 was a childhood idol for @entity75 and it would appear fitting if he could ride into @entity18 in three weeks ' time in yellow and make cycling history .			0
