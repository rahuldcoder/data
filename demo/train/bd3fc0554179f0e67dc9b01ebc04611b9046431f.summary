@entity0 -- the @entity2 agreed monday to confront another high - profile challenge to affirmative action in college admissions			1
the justices will decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in @entity9 banning race - and sex - based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions			1
the high court is currently deciding a separate challenge to admissions policies at the @entity17 , which did not involve a voter referendum			1
a federal appeals court last year concluded the affirmative action ban , which @entity9 voters passed in a 2006 referendum , violated the @entity25 @entity24 's equal protection laws			1
appeals court strikes down @entity9 's affirmative action ban it was the latest step in a legal and political battle over whether the state 's colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing which students to admit			1
the ban 's opponents say classroom diversity remains a necessary government role			2
" we think this is a tremendous victory for the tens and hundreds of thousands of students who fought for affirmative action for decades , " said @entity9 attorney @entity40 when the @entity42 ruling came out in november			1
he represents the @entity48 coalition that sued to overturn the ban			2
" this is a tremendous day for black and @entity52 students in the entire country , " @entity40 added			1
the office of @entity9 attorney general @entity55 will defend the ban when oral arguments are held in the fall			1
the ban " embodies the fundamental premise of what @entity25 is all about : equal opportunity under the law , " @entity55 said			1
" entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit			2
" the law was passed seven years ago with support of 58 % of voters			0
it was added to the state 's constitution , and bars publicly funded colleges from granting " preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race , sex , color , ethnicity or national origin			1
" opinion : keep affirmative action but reform it that prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from various groups			2
@entity9 voters approved the ban after the @entity25 @entity2 ruled in 2003 that while @entity9 universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit , they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted the referendum effort was led by @entity102 , who was at the center of the high court case			1
as a white student , she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state 's largest university			2
she eventually attended another school , and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent discrimination lawsuit			0
after the @entity2 's 2003 decision , she began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions			0
the @entity9 ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions			1
but the current high court case deals only with the college admissions portion			2
efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial			0
the @entity129 high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools , but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states who initially refused to integrate			0
in the 1978 @entity137 case , the @entity2 ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity , and that allows for the use of affirmative action			0
that issue involved a discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school			0
opinion : chief justice out to end affirmative action the @entity2 is now considering whether the @entity17 ' admissions practices aimed at creating campus diversity violate the rights of some white applicants			0
arguments were held in october and a written ruling is pending			0
the high court under chief justice @entity159 has made the issue a key part of its docket in recent years , and it could serve as a major legacy of the current conservative majority			0
the justices in 2007 struck down public school choice plans in @entity167 and @entity168 , concluding race could not be a factor in the assignment of children to schools			0
those school districts had sought to use raced - based criteria to achieve diversity			1
the issue in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met			0
now - retired justice @entity181 -- who wrote the key ruling a decade ago in the initial @entity9 cases -- said , " the court expects that 25 years from now , the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today			1
" the justices are now being asked once again to decide whether @entity9 's current policy meets that legal and social test			2
the case is @entity55 v. @entity192 to defend @entity193 , integration , and @entity195 ( 12 - 682 )			0
opinion : taking affirmative action personally			0
