@entity7 a ticking clock and a @entity2 calendar conundrum , turmoil in @entity4 and a @entity6 establishment revenge plot filled our sunday trip around the " @entity12 " table			1
@entity13 was proof in 2010 that the tea party movement was growing from protest movement to political force			2
@entity13 stunned the @entity6 establishment by wresting the @entity19 nomination for a @entity21 seat in @entity22 from longtime incumbent sen. @entity23 , and from that moment on has been a national tea party star			1
now , the establishment is looking to return the favor			2
so far , no credible 2016 primary challenger has emerged despite frequent complaints about @entity13 from @entity22 business and @entity6 establishment figures			1
but @entity8 is told there is now an aggressive push to lure a onetime @entity6 star back into the game			1
former @entity22 gov. @entity37 , you might recall , went nowhere as a 2012 @entity19 presidential candidate			1
since then , @entity37 is more often seen in @entity7 , where he is a radio host for a program affiliated with the @entity42 political organization			1
it 's no secret that @entity45 's deep - pocketed father is not a fan of @entity13 's			0
word now is that @entity22 business leaders are looking to talk @entity37 into returning home full time to challenge @entity13			1
and some of the national @entity6 establishment forces who were successful in opposing tea party candidates in 2014 have told their @entity22 allies they will join a pitch to @entity37			1
there are myriad reasons to be skeptical such a heavyweight matchup will materialize , but it 's worth watching			0
@entity60 wrapped up his work as a top @entity64 @entity63 lieutenant on friday , yet the @entity65 will be just as much on his mind as he shifts to his new job			0
@entity60 is taking a top position in the nascent @entity70 presidential campaign			1
after a week - plus of headlines about infighting in the @entity76 ranks , the @entity72 's @entity71 reports there is a feeling among many party loyalists that @entity60 is getting started not a moment too soon			1
" i 'm told that even though he 's going to be the campaign chairman , he 's going to have a very hands - on , day - to - day role , " said @entity71			0
" he 's not going to be somebody who 's just doing 30,000 - foot strategic thinking			0
and that 's very important to a lot of the @entity90 camp			0
" watch now for reports of " @entity93 " moments ; @entity60 is a disciplined , driven but normally soft - spoken guy but is known for having a more feisty alter ego when he feels it necessary to bang heads			0
the wrangling getting the most attention in @entity4 of late is among players in the super @entity101 community who are gearing up to support her campaign			1
accounts vary widely depending on who you talk to -- and their loyalties -- but suffice it to say there are turf and title wars going on , as well as some ego clashes			2
at the center of much of this is @entity115 , once a @entity90 nemesis , now turned @entity90 convert			0
he was on the board of super @entity118 , and also runs a @entity120 ( anti-republican ) research group			2
@entity115 resigned from the @entity122 board in a dustup with longtime @entity64 operatives who are now gravitating to @entity4			0
but @entity125 of the @entity126 reports on efforts to make peace -- or at least detente			2
" one @entity130 told me that the @entity122 folks are groveling to @entity115 , " said @entity125			0
" i am told that he is on course to come back to the board -- likely to happen early this week			1
" both parties have rules about their presidential nominating calendars , and the @entity138 is especially eager to assert more control over the schedule , debates and more heading into 2016			2
but @entity8 's @entity142 says @entity143 wants more impact on presidential politics -- even if it means sanctions			1
remember , as a table setter , @entity147 votes first , followed by @entity149 and then @entity150			0
" @entity143 passed a statute last year that said they are going to go the week after @entity150 , one of the first four states in the @entity19 nominating process , " said @entity142			1
" so three days after these first four states , you could have a state with a lot of big media markets and a lot of voters right square in the middle of this nominating fight			2
and the people i 've talked to in @entity143 , in the @entity19 there , say they do not care at all if the @entity138 penalizes them with delegates or whatever ; they want the attention , they want to be square out front			1
" @entity172 gov. @entity171 is off to @entity150 soon			0
which means -- you know what			2
officially , it 's part of his recent travels pushing a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget			0
but @entity171 won a big re-election in 2014 and is among a handful of @entity6 potential 2016 contenders who need to soon make tough choices			1
or , as the @entity188 's @entity187 reports , there is a clock ticking because a crowded @entity19 field means activists and fund - raisers are feeling pressure to pick sides			0
" @entity195 is running out for him to decide , " said @entity187			0
" i spoke to him recently and he says he has n't made up his mind			0
people close to him think he really has n't decided what he 's going to do			0

an end to the *feuding* in the @entity70 super pac world
@entity37 being courted for a 2016 @entity6 run -- in @entity22
@entity143 tries to *muscle* its way into the 2016 early state ranks
