@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 said on friday security threats had forced @entity1 to revive the @entity6 - era practice of sending bomber aircraft on regular patrols beyond its borders			1

@entity3 said 14 strategic bombers had taken off simultaneously from airfields across @entity1 in the early hours of friday on long - range missions			1
" we have decided to restore flights by @entity1 strategic aviation on a permanent basis , " @entity3 told reporters after inspecting joint military exercises with @entity20 and four @entity22 states in @entity1 's @entity24 mountains			1
" today , august 17 at 00:00 hours , 14 strategic bombers took to the air from seven airfields across the country , along with support and refueling aircraft ... from today such patrols will be carried out on a regular basis			0
" we hope our partners will treat this with understanding			0
" at @entity44 president @entity43 's @entity42 ranch , @entity40 spokesman @entity39 said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the @entity44			1
" militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities , so this is not entirely surprising , " he said			0
but the sorties are likely to add to @entity53 concern about @entity1 's growing assertiveness			0
that trend has prompted some @entity44 policymakers to draw parallels with the @entity58			0
@entity3 caused a stir this year by saying @entity1 missiles would once again be aimed at targets in @entity62 if @entity63 persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern @entity62			2
@entity1 diplomats have clashed with the @entity44 and @entity62 governments on issues such as @entity69 , energy , and @entity13 's treatment of its @entity73 neighbors			2
western military leaders have said this year that @entity1 flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period			2
one @entity53 defense official called the flights " a little bit of chest - pounding , trying to let people know @entity1 is back in the game "			2
@entity3 said that when @entity1 had cut its flights in 1992 , other military powers had not reciprocated			1
" flights by other countries ' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the @entity1 , " @entity3 said			1
that appeared to be a swipe at the @entity44 and @entity94 , whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long - range missions			1
as @entity3 spoke to reporters and television cameras , four @entity1 military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while @entity1 tanks trundled behind him , even though the exercises had ended long before			1
during the @entity58 , @entity1 long - range bombers , which can carry strategic nuclear weapons , played elaborate games of cat - and - mouse with @entity53 air forces			1
earlier this month @entity1 air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the @entity112 island of @entity113 , where the @entity44 military has a base , and " exchanged smiles " with @entity44 pilots scrambled to track them			1
the @entity118 said the @entity1 aircraft had not come close enough to @entity44 ships to prompt @entity44 aircraft to react			2
in july , two @entity1 @entity123 " bombers made unusually long sorties over the @entity125 , leading @entity126 and @entity127 to scramble fighter jets to follow them			0
@entity1 's air force said later it was a routine flight			0
