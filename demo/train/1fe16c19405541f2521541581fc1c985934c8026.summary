@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has pledged to repeal president @entity5 's universal health care law if he is elected president			1
critics find his position rather strange , arguing that the plan he helped develop when he was governor of @entity1 is quite similar in design to the @entity5 plan			1
@entity3 disputes his critics , saying there are important and fundamental differences between the plans			1
who is correct ? in actuality , both plans draw extensively from legislation offered by president @entity21 in january 1974			0
in a book just published , " @entity27 , and @entity28 , " @entity22 and i explain how @entity3 and @entity5 used the same approach as @entity21 to lower the number of uninsured			1
all three built their system on private , employer - sponsored insurance in which all but the smallest employers had to provide insurance to their workers or pay a penalty			1
all utilized @entity36 to insure the elderly and an expanded medicaid - type program to insure the poor			0
all provided subsidies to low - income individuals and small employers			0
the @entity3 and @entity5 plans created state - based private insurance exchanges to make insurance more accessible and affordable to small business and individuals			1
president @entity5 has been heavily criticized by conservatives because his plan includes a mandate for all individuals to have insurance or pay a penalty			2
@entity3 , too , has joined those criticizing the president , yet his plan in @entity1 included just such a mandate			0
this idea was originally proposed by conservative groups as a measure of personal responsibility and an alternative to a single - payer system advocated by many progressive organizations			0
@entity3 believes it is alright to have a state require all to have coverage but that it can not be mandated by the federal government			0
@entity3 contends the @entity1 plan required no new funding , whereas the @entity5 law calls for nearly a trillion dollars in increased taxes and cuts in projected @entity36 spending over 10 years			1
what @entity3 does n't say is that the @entity1 plan is partly funded with earmarked federal dollars and partly with state funds generated by a tax increase previously enacted to pay for a universal coverage plan that was never implemented			2
unfortunately for @entity5 , there was no larger entity to support his plan			0
he had to pay for his plan with new federal monies and cuts in future federal spending			0
although the federal government will assume a greater proportion of health spending , total health spending in the @entity87 is projected to increase only 2 % more by 2019 under the @entity5 plan than it would have otherwise			2
as with the @entity21 proposal , neither @entity3 nor @entity5 decided to include significant measures to reduce health care costs			1
although both were criticized , i believe that was a sound political decision that allowed all the major health groups to support both plans			0
president @entity102 's health plan drew strong opposition from many stakeholders because it included a tight spending budget			1
under @entity5 's plan , hospitals , insurers and drug companies agreed to modest cuts in future revenues or rate increases , because all expected increased revenues from the millions of newly insured @entity87			2
both @entity5 and @entity3 expected that constraining health costs would be necessary in future years			1
a complete review of the two plans should acknowledge that the @entity5 plan includes many components not in the @entity1 legislation			2
the most controversial are a board appointed to control @entity36 spending and a requirement that insurance companies spend a minimum percentage of their revenues on direct patient care			0
the plan also includes a number of provisions to reform @entity36 and @entity129 , and an extensive list of new delivery system approaches to be tested with federal pilot and demonstration programs			0
important as these components may be , they are not part of the basic framework of the plan			0
after comparing the @entity3 and @entity5 plans , it is clear that the similarities far outweigh the differences			1
@entity3 could argue , however , that @entity5 did n't use the @entity1 plan as a model but rather drew on the proposal put forth by @entity21 almost 40 years earlier			1
@entity3 's plan worked for @entity1 , reducing its uninsured rate to the lowest in the country			2
although the legislation did not put a brake on rising health care costs , there is some evidence it did reduce its rate of growth compared to other parts of the country			1
health insurance premiums have traditionally been higher in @entity1 than in the rest of the @entity87			2
the gap , however , has narrowed somewhat as premium growth between 2006 and 2010 in the @entity87 grew by an average yearly rate of 5.1 % while in @entity1 the average growth was 4.4 %			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

@entity3 promises to repeal @entity5 health care plan , yet critics find links between two
@entity166 says both plans had their basis in @entity21 's health care plan
all three plans built on private , employer sponsored health insurance
@entity3 , @entity5 plans do n't significantly restrain costs , he says
