@entity13 , @entity14 : here with your results from the @entity19 midterm elections , plus more events from around the world , this is your commercial - free show for the classroom : @entity0 student news ! first up : @entity19 @entity26 results @entity28 @entity27 , ( r ) minority leader : let me just say this : it 's clear tonight who the winners really are , and that 's the @entity19 people			1
it was the @entity19 people 's voice that was heard at the ballot box -- the @entity19 people 's voice			1
and listen , i 'm gon na be brief because we 've got real work to do and , frankly , this is not a time for celebration			1
@entity44 : representative @entity27 , saying he and other @entity45 are ready to get back to work in @entity47 you might have noticed his title : minority leader			2
when it comes to the @entity19 @entity26 , his party wo n't be in the minority much longer			2
yesterday , we explained how the @entity45 needed to win 39 additional seats to take control in the @entity26			2
they won at least 60			2
experts say that is the biggest gain by any major political party since 1948			2
when we produced this show on wednesday , republicans were projected to win 239 of the 435 seats in the @entity26			2
democrats were projected to take 185			2
11 races had n't been called yet			2
it takes 218 to hold a majority in the @entity26			2
an important thing to keep in mind : the new members of @entity73 who were elected tuesday , they are n't starting their new jobs just yet			1
that 'll happen in january			2
and when it does , a lot of people expect that representative @entity27 will be chosen as the new speaker of the @entity26			2
@entity19 senate results sen. @entity81 , ( @entity82 ) majority leader : i have to admit , this has been one of the toughest			1
but it 's nothing compared to the fights families are facing all over @entity89 right now			1
this race has been called , but the fight is far from over			2
the bell that just rang is n't the end of the fight , it 's the start of the next round			1
@entity44 : heading over to the other side of @entity73 now , the @entity97			1
that was senator @entity81 , a @entity100 and the @entity97 majority leader			2
his party will stay in the majority in the @entity97			2
takes 51 seats to hold that majority			2
after tuesday 's results , @entity0 is projecting that @entity106 will hold 52 seats			1
republicans are projected to hold 47			2
there was still 1 seat undecided when we recorded today 's show			1
that 47 number for the @entity45 is up from 41 before the midterms			2
so , they did make gains , just not enough to win a @entity97 majority			2
you 've heard a lot about the @entity121 movement during this campaign season			2
it had an impact on the election results			1
@entity97 candidates in @entity127 and @entity128 who were backed by @entity121 supporters both won their elections			2
and some experts said that the @entity121 movement was responsible for the big shift in the @entity26 , too			2
what 's the @entity134 ? @entity135 , @entity14 : what 's the @entity134 ? relating to or about a governor gubernatorial that 's the word ! governors ' races / ballot measures @entity44 : @entity45 appear to also have won a gubernatorial majority after the results of tuesday 's 37 elections for governor			1
they needed to take at least three governors ' offices away from @entity106 to win that majority			2
they picked up at least 10			0
some gubernatorial races went the other way , switching from republicans to @entity106			0
and in @entity154 , neither party won			0
that state elected an independent as its new governor			0
was n't just people on the ballot			0
voters also decided on certain issues that could become laws in their states			0
a few examples : @entity165 passed an amendment to the state 's constitution that will allow for the governor to be recalled from office			1
a couple states passed a bill that would let people there opt out of the @entity19 government 's health care reform requirements			1
and in @entity178 , voters shot down a measure to legalize marijuana			0
presidential reaction @entity44 : in order to understand why @entity19 vote the way they do , organizations ask people questions as they leave polling locations			1
these are called exit polls			0
on tuesday , those polls showed the economy was far and away the most important issue on the minds of voters			0
exit polls also indicated that more than half of @entity19 are n't too happy with either @entity45 or @entity106			0
it 's something that president @entity197 talked about when he discussed the election results			1
@entity19 president @entity197 : over the last two years , we 've made progress			0
but clearly , too many @entity19 have n't felt that progress yet , and they told us that yesterday			0
and as president , i take responsibility for that			0
what yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here			0
but we must find common ground in order to set , in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges			1
