@entity4 , @entity5 " i was in a position to see exactly what happens in the human hand			2
i got the basics of what it 's all about and thought yeah , i 'll make my own			1
" @entity10 is recalling the moment in may 2011 when he sat in a @entity14 hospital waiting to hear if his fingers could be stitched back on			1
just an hour earlier , he had been in his carpentry workshop sawing wood when the saw slipped and ripped diagonally through the four fingers on his right hand			1
" it all happened too quickly to know what actually happened , " he remembers			0
rather than fear the outcome , or dwell on the repercussions of losing his fingers , he was already thinking of ways to fix the problem , like a true carpenter			1
after days of scouring the @entity30 he could n't find anywhere to buy a functional prosthetic finger and he was astonished at the cost of prosthetic hands and limbs which began in the tens of thousands of dollars			2
but his online surfing paid off as it brought him to an amateur video posted by a mechanical effects artist in @entity39 , by the name of @entity41			0
together , the pair developed a mechanical finger for @entity10 , but their partnership has also gone on to benefit countless hand and arm amputees around the globe , through the birth of the company " @entity50			1
" officially launched in january 2012 , @entity50 creates affordable mechanical prosthetics through the use of 3d printers			1
not only that , but it has made its designs open source , so that anyone with access to such printers can print out fingers , hands and now arms as well			1
printing prosthetics using the process of additive manufacture , the specialized printers use the thermoplastic material @entity68 ( @entity68 ) to print body parts such as knuckles and joints , which when combined with stainless steel and aluminum produce a personalized prosthetic which customers can assemble and fit themselves courtesy of a free open - source manual available to them			1
within five minutes of getting it fitted , people can actually use it , " explains @entity79 , the communications manager in the team			0
" it 's anatomically driven by the wrist , elbow , or shoulder once fitted , " he adds -- meaning its movements are controlled by the user			2
the first @entity50 ever created was made for five - year - old @entity91 , from @entity5 , who was born with amniotic band syndrome ( @entity93 ) , which left him with no fingers on his right hand			1
within minutes of fitting his newly printed mechanical hand @entity91 beamed excitedly and expressed how he could now " pick up stuff , " describing its movement by saying : " it copies me			0
" " they all have their special moment , " says @entity102			0
@entity105 drives the whole process on simplicity , voicing his desire to remove unnecessary red tape and cost when providing people with something as essential as a limb			0
a full adult hand costs as little as $ 2,000 , takes five and a half hours to print and approximately 10 - 15 hours to assemble			1
ordering a prosthetic is also quite simple			0
customers are sent measurement forms to complete and send those in combination with @entity122 scans of their hands for translation into the software , which will print out the parts for their desired prosthetic			1
where 3 - d scans are n't feasible , hard molds can instead be made and shipped to the team in @entity5			1
the simplicity of the ordering process has led to demand outstripping what @entity50 can supply , with requests for limbs coming from almost every country around the globe			1
there is now an eight - month waiting list when orders are placed			2
" i know of only three countries that have n't had a hand yet , " says @entity10			0
" to make sure everyone can have access we essentially steal from the rich and give to the poor			0
those who can afford it pay , and those that ca n't we find a way for someone to pay it for them			0
" because @entity157 's manuals and @entity122 printable files are available online , others are also using its designs to print prosthetics			1
" we stopped counting at 200 hands that were made back in november 2013 , " says @entity10			2
" but we can see there have now been over 143,000 downloads of the software			0
people all over the world are doing this without us			0
we do n't even know of them all			0
" paying it forward the majority of its customers are in the @entity174 , where most customers can afford its relatively low prices , so @entity10 is able to subsidize prosthetics for those who are more disadvantaged			0
" we had @entity178 in @entity179 who received a @entity50 and when his dad saw the impact he paid for @entity183 , another person on our waiting list , to receive one as well , " says @entity10			1
@entity183 was also born with @entity93 , like @entity91 , leaving him no fingers on his right hand , and van as was able to fit him with a working hand too			2
" it 's all about paying it forward as people want to help , " says @entity10			2
@entity50 is growing and the team plans on expanding past the fingers and arms currently on offer			1
" our next step is to print whole legs for people to use and walk on , " explains @entity10			2
but it does n't stop there			0
" then if we make that work , the goal is entire exoskeletons , for paraplegics to be able to walk again			0

@entity157 makes cheap artificial hands and arms using 3 - d printers
founder @entity209 lost four fingers in a carpentry *accident*
@entity50 's designs are open source so others can download and print them
