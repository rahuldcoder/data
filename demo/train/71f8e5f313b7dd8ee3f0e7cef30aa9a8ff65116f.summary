-- with fallout still swirling from @entity3 's decision to replace @entity4 with its own mobile mapping , @entity6 on thursday announced the biggest upgrade ever to its @entity9 tool			1
the update adds more than 250,000 miles of roadways in 17 countries , said @entity13 , @entity6 's @entity9 program manager , in a blog post thursday			1
the @entity9 feature on @entity4 lets users see a real - world , 360 - degree view of locations			1
showcasing @entity6 's global reach , the new coverage areas include parts of @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33			2
since launching in 2007 , @entity9 had captured 20 petabytes of data in 48 countries			2
the company uses cars , trikes , snowmobiles and people outfitted with custom cameras to capture 360 - degree images around the world			0
in the new update , @entity6 also added a spate of " special collections " to the feature , providing virtual tours of attractions around the globe			1
" @entity9 , as you know , is a useful resource when you 're planning a route or looking for a destination , but it can also magically transport you to some of the world 's picturesque and culturally significant landmarks , " @entity13 said			0
the new spots include @entity60 and @entity61 in @entity62 , @entity63 in @entity27 and @entity64 in @entity65			0
@entity4 has been on the minds of many since @entity3 decided to replace it as the default mapping system on @entity69 , the latest version of its mobile operating system			1
the update coincided roughly with the release of the @entity74 , meaning millions saw the new product for the first time after getting their new phones			2
early reviews have not been kind			0
@entity3 's mapping software has been a spotty mess , missing huge chunks of the globe and , at times , placing notable landmarks in the wrong place , sometimes humorously so			0
the release was bad enough that @entity3 ceo @entity88 issued a rare apology , saying in an open letter that @entity3 is " extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused " and promising to improve the feature			2
@entity6 has been officially silent on whether it plans to release a new @entity4 app for @entity69 , which runs on @entity95 , @entity96 and ipods			1
reports suggest that it 's doing so , but there 's no guarantee @entity3 would approve it			0
in the past , the company has turned down apps that it deemed compete with its own features			0
that 's a fact @entity6 ceo @entity88 acknowledged wednesday , speaking at an @entity107 conference , where he declined to confirm that a new version of maps is in the works for @entity3 mobile devices			1
" @entity3 should have kept our maps , " @entity88 said , according to @entity112 .			0

@entity6 adds 250,000 miles to its @entity9 feature
