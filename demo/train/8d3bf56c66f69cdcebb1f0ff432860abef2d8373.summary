-- not so long ago , @entity1 was vilified for its slow economic growth , high unemployment rates , and record budget deficits			1
as late as 2004 , @entity5 called it the " sick man of @entity8			0
" today , @entity1 is the world 's fourth largest economy , and the most important market in the @entity12			1
its 5.3 % unemployment rate is the second lowest in the @entity12			1
@entity1 exports more merchandise than any other country aside from @entity16 , and its share of total world trade is larger than that of the @entity20 not bad for a nation of 81 million citizens that 's not even among the world 's 15 most populated worldwide			1
the roots of @entity1 's 21st century economic success date back to the @entity26 , when @entity27 were early adopters of rail transportation and coal production			1
but the country 's current rise to status of economic superstar began on a cold autumn day , exactly 25 years ago			2
fall of the wall on november 9 , 1989 , a group of excited @entity36 used mauls , chisels , hammers and fists to smash down the wall that divided the @entity43 and @entity44 part of the city			1
the fall of the @entity47 was a landmark moment , which intensified a process that fully materialized two years later with the collapse of the @entity51			1
what @entity43 @entity27 found when they entered @entity1 was a society marked by high unemployment rate , low productivity and a lot of poverty			1
they also found a highly skilled workforce that was comparatively cheap , and new markets with an appetite for products			0
they found opportunities -- not only in the eastern part of their reunified nation , but also in many other former @entity51 - bloc countries , like the @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			0
" part of the success story of the @entity27 multinationals was their capacity to use the opportunities that arose -- first with reunification , and secondly with the expansion of the @entity12 , " said @entity70 , director of the @entity71 , a @entity72 - based think tank			2
" @entity27 companies became increasingly skilled at understanding foreign markets and leaning towards foreign markets			0
@entity1 has done that in a way which i 'd say is more efficient than what you see in the @entity89 or @entity90 , which are the other two big economies that traditionally have had an outward - oriented vision			2
" ahead of the times by the end of the 1990s , businesses from @entity1 played key roles in countries transitioning to a market economy , according to @entity70			1
@entity27 manufacturers were outsourcing parts of their supply chain to @entity8 , and @entity27 financial firms provided services to millions of people who were just discovering capitalism			0
it did n't end on the eastern edge of @entity8			0
@entity1 turned into one of the world 's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging @entity112 markets , especially @entity16 and @entity113 , according to @entity114 , professor of economics at @entity116			1
" you have these two huge blocks , huge economies that were starving for investment goods and it just so happens that is where @entity1 had its comparative advantage -- in the production of investment goods , " @entity114 said			2
" the high @entity16 growth rates meant there was enormous demand for @entity27 goods			2
" the goods @entity114 referred to are mainly vehicles , machinery , pharmaceuticals and electronics			0
@entity27 car manufacturers like @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 established a particularly strong presence in the @entity16 market			0
companies like @entity142 , @entity143 ( chemicals ) , @entity145 ( one @entity8 's largest banks ) , and @entity147 ( insurance ) also became leading global corporations			2
promoting skills in addition , thousands of medium - sized companies , often family owned , have been successful internationally and particularly in @entity112 , according to @entity153 , professor of public policy at the @entity155 in @entity156			0
@entity153 said one of the keys to @entity1 's manufacturing success is the country 's unique apprenticeship scheme , in which school leavers spend two to three years training with companies			1
" the apprenticeship scheme is very important in particular for manufacturing companies because they train people at mid-level skills in a very specific way , " said @entity153			0
" they give them industry and firm - specific skills			0
" @entity153 explained that having relatively highly - skilled workers allows companies to be more flexible with their production process , and continuously improve			0
but it 's not all rosy			0
according to @entity153 , @entity1 's dependence on exports make it very vulnerable			1
during the 2008 - 09 financial crisis , the loss of @entity181 ( gdp ) @entity1 experienced was large compare to other countries , and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the @entity27 economy			1
and fluctuations will always happen			0
currently , as market demand in @entity16 and other emerging markets is slowing down , @entity1 's challenge is to rebalance its economy away from an enormously heavy dependence on exports			1
it needs to increase domestic consumption , which has been relatively weak for decades , otherwise the economic growth it has experienced will not be sustained			2
in the quarter of a century that has passed since the @entity196 tore down that wall , @entity1 has , no doubt , become an economic superpower			2
but as @entity27 know better than anyone , economic realities can change very quickly .			0

today , @entity1 is the world 's fourth largest economy with a low unemployment rate
the 25th *anniversary* of the fall of the @entity47 *highlights* economic success
collapse of @entity44 and @entity43 has meant *massive* growth for @entity1 in various industries
