-- the @entity2 on tuesday unveiled a " trusted traveler " program -- one meant to expedite screening at @entity6 airport checkpoints , agency chief @entity1 said			1
" as with any initiative , we are testing this prescreening concept with a small passenger population at limited airports , " he said at an aviation security conference in the @entity9			0
" if proven successful , we will explore expanding the program to additional travelers , airports and airlines			2
" all participants must be @entity6 citizens who voluntarily release certain information about themselves			1
during its evaluation phase , @entity20 will be available only to certain frequent fliers on @entity6 and @entity24 airlines flying out of certain airports			1
@entity24 passengers must be flying out of @entity28 and @entity29 airports , and @entity31 passengers must be flying out of @entity33 and @entity34 airports			2
it was opened to participants in @entity37 and @entity39 's trusted traveler programs , including @entity40 , @entity41 , and @entity42			0
" as @entity2 moves further away from a one - size - fits - all approach , our ultimate goal is provide the most effective security in the most efficient way possible , " said @entity43 , @entity2 assistant administrator of security operations			1
the program wo n't guarantee expedited security screening , according to @entity1 , who said participants would still be subject to " random and unpredictable security measures			1
" in july , the @entity2 said it would expand this pilot program to include @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity60 airlines , and additional airports , once operationally ready			1
currently , the @entity2 vets passenger lists against " watch lists " of known or suspected terrorists			2
but the @entity2 is working with a very limited amount of information about those passengers -- namely a person 's full name , date of birth and gender			0
under trusted traveler programs , travelers voluntarily surrender more information about themselves , giving the government more assurances of who they are			0
the amount and nature of the information that will be sought were not disclosed			0
there have long been calls for the @entity2 to adopt a trusted traveler program			1
@entity84 and critics have stepped up that demand following two highly publicized incidents , one involving the search of a 6 - year - old girl , and the other involving a 95 - year - old cancer patient			0
in both cases , the @entity2 has said the airport screeners were following established protocols			0
but the @entity2 also has said it is working toward a " risk - based " trusted traveler program that could expedite travel for people believed to present little risk to aviation			2
the @entity2 said in july that @entity100 will work with @entity102 commissioner @entity101 and the airlines to determine passenger eligibility for this screening project , which is voluntary			1
all passengers in the pilot project will be subject to recurrent security checks			1
security experts have long expressed concern about so - called clean skins -- potential terrorists who enroll in trusted traveler programs to avoid scrutiny during a terror mission			0
but the @entity2 says it will continue to incorporate random and unpredictable security measures to address such concerns			2
@entity1 said in july that other layers of security will remain in place , including intelligence gathering and analysis , explosive - detection canine teams , federal air marshals , closed - circuit television monitoring and behavior detection officers			0
@entity0 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity2 officials say the program is meant to *balance* security with efficiency
the program would be expanded to other airlines over time
all participants must be @entity6 citizens
the pilot project will start with @entity24 and @entity6 airlines
