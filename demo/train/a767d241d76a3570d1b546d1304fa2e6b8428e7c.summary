@entity0 , @entity1 -- a boat 's horn bellowed 32 times off the coast of @entity1 on sunday , honoring each of the victims who died a year ago when a luxury cruise liner ran aground			1
family members of those who perished tossed wreaths , lilies and notes into icy waters at a ceremony marking the anniversary of the @entity18 crash			1
and a large boulder bearing a plaque with victims ' names was lowered into the same sea that claimed their lives			0
the somber memorial was a sharp contrast to the chaos of a year ago , when the massive ship ran aground with 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members on board			1
according to passengers ' accounts , pandemonium erupted as guests rushed to fill the lifeboats and escape the ship			2
some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard ; remaining members seemed helpless to handle the melee			2
the night of the accident , many survivors sought shelter in churches and other buildings on the tiny @entity49 island of @entity0			1
at one of the churches on sunday , many survivors and family members of victims gathered for a two - hour @entity55 to remember the victims and honor divers and rescue workers			1

meanwhile , the @entity18 , now a half - submerged carcass , still sits in the harbor where it ran aground			1
hundreds of people are working 24 - 7 to secure it , but salvage efforts are taking longer than expected			0
officials now hope to have the ship upright by late june or early july and to tow it to some port by september			0
during sunday 's ceremony , the skies were overcast and a fierce wind blew			0
the seas were rough , and the waves washed up against the wreckage and salvage barges with such force that crews had to reinforce their equipment			0
" thank @entity111 the weather was n't like this last year , " @entity109 told reporters as she stared at the wreckage			0
the weather was more temperate last year , when she and her husband @entity114 escaped the ship carrying their 10 - month - old son @entity116 down a rope ladder			2
the family came on sunday to mark the occasion , she said , and to try to help deal with the post-traumatic stress disorder they 've been battling over the past year			2
the @entity18 's captain , @entity124 , could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship			1
other crew members and @entity18 executives also could face trial			2
@entity131 has said that managers of the cruise line instructed him to sail close to the island and has denied allegations that he was sailing too fast			0
he said the rock the ship struck was not indicated on his charts of the area			0
in an interview with @entity1 's " @entity141 " television show on sunday , @entity131 blamed the ship 's helmsman for misunderstanding orders to avoid the rocks			1
the captain said he 'd felt pain over the victims ' deaths every day for the past year			0
the day was a somber reminder of the lives lost in the shipwreck , but it was also important for the 900 residents of @entity0 to commemorate an event that changed their island forever			1
" this is not a celebration , " mayor @entity158 said			0
" this year has been dramatic for the people of this island who have had their whole lives turned upside down by this event			2
