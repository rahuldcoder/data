@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few thousand people turned out sunday to protest in @entity1 , saying the king 's proposed constitutional reforms do n't go far enough			1
though many expressed support for their king to stay in power , demonstrators argued that a network of privilege and patronage surrounding him must end , and that he must part with more power than he has proposed			2
in calling for the protests on saturday , a member of the @entity19 wing said participants are seeking " a truly democratic constitution and a parliamentary monarchy			2
" " the plan as proposed by the king yesterday does not respond to our demands for a true separation of powers , " the organizer said saturday			2
but a @entity0 - based spokeswoman for the reform movement spoke out saturday against organizing demonstrations , saying , " all @entity1 are happy with the king 's speech			1
" king @entity35 of @entity1 declared sweeping reforms that will boost the power of the prime minister and take away some of his own			1
the revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable , the parliament in @entity19 more dynamic and will give the government greater powers , the 47 - year - old king said in a nationally televised address			1
the reform movement has called for the creation of a parliamentary monarchy , an end to the influence of the king 's inner circle and for a crackdown on corrupt officials			1
@entity55 and @entity56 are examples of a parliamentary monarchy			0
in his 30 - minute speech friday , the sovereign described the draft constitution as " a bedrock of the special @entity1 democratic development model -- a new historical bond between the throne and the people , " while describing himself as a " citizen king			1
" his actions followed a series of unprecedented protests in this @entity75 modern @entity74 country , where street protests are normally tolerated by the state , unlike in most other @entity79 countries			0
if the draft is ratified in a referendum set for july 1 , its most radical change would be empowering voters to select a prime minister , thereby ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job			1
the prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state			0
if @entity1 back the draft , then the new prime minister would have new powers in decision - making and in day - to - day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some @entity107 countries			1
in an example of power sharing , the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the @entity112 , and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of parliament			1
" it specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches , " the king said			0
friday 's speech stems from a process that was first announced in march , after widespread civil unrest in the wake of the revolutions in @entity131 and @entity132			0
the king instructed a hand - picked committee to consult with political parties , trade unions and civil society groups on constitutional changes with a brief to trim the monarch 's political powers and make the judiciary independent			1
but not all civil society groups were consulted , which sparked a wave of demonstrations across the kingdom from groups who feared they would be left out of the new plan			0
this move alone -- to grant real power to an elected prime minister -- could satisfy a number of demands from those members of society who have called for change			0
confirming the full authority of the head of government over cabinet members , the draft constitution gives the prime minister the power to propose and dismiss cabinet members			0
but @entity165 will remain a key power broker in the security , military and religious fields , according to the draft			2
for example , the king would still serve as " the supreme commander of the armed forces " and would not relinquish the power to appoint ambassadors and diplomats under the new constitution			2
furthermore , the king would retain the power to dissolve parliament after consultations with the new constitutional court , half of whose members he would have appointed			0
journalist @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
