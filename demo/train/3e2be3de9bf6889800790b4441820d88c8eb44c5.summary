@entity0 -- most of the weapons that @entity5 drug cartels use are smuggled from the @entity6 , but the @entity6 government lacks a cohesive strategy to combat the arms trafficking , according to a @entity11 report to be released thursday			1
assault rifle magazines are among weapons seized in april in northern @entity5 near the @entity6 border			1
in @entity5 last year , drug violence was blamed for the deaths of 78 soldiers and more than 6,000 others			1
this year , the drug violence has claimed more than 2,900 lives , according to the newspaper @entity21			1
much of the violence has affected the @entity6 - @entity5 border			2
over the last five years , about 87 percent of firearms seized and traced by @entity5 authorities were purchased in the @entity6 , a draft of the report says			2
most of the weapons were acquired at gun shops and shows in border states , according to the report			0
many of these are high - caliber and high - power weapons , including @entity35 and @entity37 semiautomatic rifles			0
the two agencies tasked with curbing arms smuggling to @entity5 , the @entity45 and @entity46 , " do not effectively coordinate their efforts , in part because the agencies lack clear roles and responsibilities , " according to the draft			0
in a statement thursday , w. @entity48 , @entity45 assistant director , said the bureau and @entity59 " are working to finalize a memorandum of understanding to maximize our joint effectiveness to combat violent crime along the @entity57 border			0
" @entity6 agencies also face other obstacles			0
officials told the @entity11 that some federal firearms laws restrict the collection of information of arms purchases and limit reporting requirements for multiple sales , hindering anti-smuggling efforts			0
of the guns traced back to the @entity6 , about 68 percent were manufactured there and about 19 percent were made in other countries and imported to the @entity6 before being smuggled to @entity5			2
" the @entity6 government lacks a strategy to address arms trafficking to @entity5 , " the draft of the report says			1
the @entity11 noted that @entity6 anti-drug efforts in @entity5 do not focus on weapons smuggling , and most of the efforts are aimed at keeping the flow of drugs from coming north , not stopping arms from flowing south			1
the report will say that the $ 1.4 billion @entity85 , the biggest drug enforcement aid package the @entity6 has given @entity5 , does not provide dedicated funding to stop weapons smuggling			1
most of the weapons cross into @entity5 in vehicles crossing international bridges along the border , where southbound inspections by customs officials are rare			0
@entity95 , which oversees the international crossings , reported that in the 2008 fiscal year , a total of 70 weapons were seized in southbound inspections			0
in the same time period , @entity5 authorities captured 30,000 weapons , 7,200 of which were submitted to the @entity45 for tracing , the report says			2
the gap between seizures and traces is a statistic that gun - rights groups say puts in question whether the majority of illegal guns in @entity5 really come from the @entity6			0
the report will be released thursday afternoon at a hearing on arms trafficking held by the @entity117 foreign affairs @entity115 on the @entity118 .			1
