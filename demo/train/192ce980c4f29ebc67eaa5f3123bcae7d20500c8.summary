-- leave the wife alone			2
many of you should admit it			2
you think there 's " something suspicious " about her			1
the police say they have " barely scratched the surface " on the investigation into @entity13 ' death in a hot car , and a lot of us have decided that @entity17 , his mom , was somehow involved			1
at the time i 'm writing this , she has not been charged with a crime , she is not a suspect , she is not the focus of the investigation -- she 's just one of the many witnesses being scrutinized by the police , as she should be			1
but she should n't be indicted by the public before the facts come out			1
it 's tempting to rush to judgment in a tragedy			1
we tend to make a gut call and then use the details in a story to try to prove that our initial call was right			1
i agree with those who are skeptical : the sexting dad @entity38 , who left the boy in the car , appears to have dug himself a pretty deep hole			2
until we hear his side of the story , he 'll probably remain there			2
but before you judge @entity17 , consider these eight points			1
her emotional state is irrelevant			1
interpreting emotional reactions is an extremely subjective business			1
@entity38 was crying in court during the probable cause hearing , yet nobody is arguing that his tears are proof he made a mistake			2
many have pointed out @entity17 's stoic , gum - chomping face in court as " suspicious			1
listening to evidence that your husband was sending photos of his penis to other women is n't going to send most women into tears , she 's probably chewing the gum to keep herself from standing up and throwing something at him			1
perhaps that 's what she meant when , as police say , she asked her husband " did you say too much ? " it might refer to saying too much about their marital problems and financial difficulties that were playing out in court			1
and more important : everyone grieves differently			2
police questioned her lack of emotion and an officer testified that @entity17 ' mother asked her " why are n't you crying ? " i can tell you why she 's not crying : she 's in shock			1
she is emotionally and mentally processing a lot			2
she is learning the horrible details about how @entity13 suffered : scratching his face and banging his head against the seat as he slowly died			1
her husband is in jail for murder			2
her husband was also sexting with several women			2
her marital and financial troubles have been exposed for the world to see			0
the world media is parked at her front door and filming her every move			0
how is she supposed to act in the wake of that avalanche ? lord only knows			0
i 'm sure she 's a hot mess of rage , fear , grief , shock and everything in between			1
her @entity116 searches about hot car deaths mean nothing			1
thousands of things new parents do might strike the rest of us as strange : they buy fabric inserts for shopping carts because they are germophobes , they boil every bottle , throw out pacifiers that drop on the floor			0
there is absolutely nothing wrong with a mother searching for information about a subject she 's worried about			1
after hearing about @entity13 's horrible death and that 44 children died last year in hot cars , you might have searched for information about it			1
" @entity142 , i 'm doing this for you			0
" at first that statement during her eulogy seemed really strange			0
what exactly is she " doing " for him ? but look at the context			0
she called him a " wonderful father " and is clearly standing by him			0
she stood up there in front of 250 people with her son in a tiny casket and had the strength to give a eulogy on behalf of both of them			1
she talked about how much she loved @entity13 , about @entity163 , about @entity13 being in " the most peaceful , wonderful place there is " and about how she was relying on her faith to give her strength			0
i refuse to believe the accomplice theories			0
you can convince me that an individual might be sick enough to kill his or her spouse and child to run off with a mistress , but the idea of a couple trying to fix their marital problems by killing their child strains belief			0
a life insurance policy is not definitive proof of motive			0
plenty of families have life insurance polices for their children and owning one is not a de facto motive for murder			0
in the @entity13 case , the $ 2,000 policy was issued by his employer and the $ 25,000 policy was purchased in 2012			0
and even if @entity17 cashes it in , as her husband has been instructing family members to do , it does n't prove she was involved in @entity13 's death either			1
it just proves they 've got very poor judgment on timing			1
but on the other hand , i 'm sure the lawyer bills and other expenses are adding up and she has to pay for them somehow			0
and finally , her statement at day care : " @entity213 must have left him in the car			0
there 's no other explanation			1
" at first blush , that statement seemed suspicious , then i thought of two things : one is mother 's intuition			1
the other is that we do n't know yet if @entity213 had said anything to her that day , even something as cryptic as " sorry			1
" the other day , my husband and i were at home and it was 12:30 in the afternoon			0
both our cellphones rang at the same time			0
it was the school calling			0
we were in a meeting , so we let it go to voicemail			0
then the home phone rang : it was the school again			0
i turned to my husband @entity238 and without thinking said , " pick it up , i bet there 's a lockdown at the school			2
" sure enough , two first graders had seen what they thought was a man with a gun -- the school was in full lockdown and @entity250 teams were on site			0
a school shooting is my worst nightmare and i had just connected the dots unconsciously			0
@entity17 's " worst nightmare " was leaving her son in the car -- did she just connect the dots ? i have my theories , as many people do			1
one day , i think @entity38 made a tragic mistake			0
when you cheat on your wife , you lead a double life and that means you are even more distracted than most frazzled working parents			0
so distracted that you might forget your kid in the back seat as you race into work to start sexting			0
if he did leave @entity13 in the car by mistake , he could have realized it in the afternoon and just could n't face what he had done			2
he might have panicked all afternoon -- so much so he convinced himself that getting in the car and driving to a crowded parking lot would make it look like an accident			0
but then , i learn about some new detail in the case -- the @entity116 searches he made about # childfreelife and " surviving prison " and i mutter " i hope they fry him			2
" the truth is ... i do n't know the truth			2
and although it is easy to speculate about the wife 's involvement , let 's all leave the lady alone			2
until i hear all the evidence i will just continue to look at the legal issues and analyze them -- because i do n't actually know what happened yet , and neither do you .			1

@entity300 : people say there 's " something suspicious " about @entity17
@entity305 : we tend to interpret details in a tragedy to *bolster* our early judgment
she says mom 's emotional state , *web* searches irrelevant ; remarks *explainable*
@entity305 : nobody knows what happened yet , so do n't indict anyone until facts are in
