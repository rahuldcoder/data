@entity0 -- transcripts published tuesday capture the dramatic conversations between port officials and a cruise ship captain , who a judge ruled can be held under house arrest while @entity10 authorities investigate his role in last week 's disaster			1
a judge ruled that @entity14 must remain in custody pending a later decision on whether to release him while authorities investigate the running aground of the @entity19 on @entity10 's @entity21 coast			1
but the judge said @entity23 can be held on house arrest rather than in jail pending that decision , said his attorney , @entity26			2
the captain has promised to cooperate with authorities , the lawyer said			1
chief prosecutor @entity30 said he did not know the grounds for the decision , which was made after the tuesday afternoon court hearing			0
" i am speechless , " he said			0
an @entity10 port official swore in frustration at the captain of the stricken vessel after it struck rocks friday night , ordering him at least 10 times to return to the cruise liner and coordinate rescue efforts , transcripts of the recorded conversations published tuesday show			1
" you get on board ! this is an order ! " the port official told @entity23			0
" you have declared ' @entity48			0
' now i 'm in charge			0
you get on board -- is that clear ? " the official said in one of the conversations published by the @entity10 newspaper @entity53			2
@entity23 says at one point that he wants to go back on board , then refers to " other rescuers " and says something about a lifeboat being stuck			0
" get on board the ship and you tell me how many people are on board			2
... clear ? you tell me if there are children , women , people with special needs , " a coast guard officer tells @entity23			2
" get on board , ( expletive ) ! " the officer curses in frustration			0
during one conversation , @entity23 first says he abandoned ship , only to appear to reverse course under questioning by an official , saying he was " catapulted into the water " but remained on scene to coordinate the rescue			2
" i did not abandon any ship , " @entity23 said , according to the transcripts			2
@entity10 prosecutors confirmed that the quotes match ones in a transcript they were using in their investigation			0
@entity23 is under investigation by @entity10 authorities for his role in the disaster , which has claimed at least 11 lives			1
prosecutors say @entity23 was on the bridge at the time and made a " grave error " that led to the disaster			0
the @entity10 coast guard and @entity96 , which owns the ship , are investigating why @entity23 took the ship so close to land in an area known for its rocky sea floor			1
" preliminary indications are that there may have been significant human error on the part of the ship 's master , capt. @entity14 , which resulted in these grave consequences , " @entity96 said			1
" the route of the vessel appears to have been too close to the shore , and the captain 's judgment in handling the emergency appears to have not followed standard @entity96 procedures , " the statement added			1
@entity118 reported that @entity23 came close to @entity119 to salute @entity120 , a legend among @entity96 ' commanders , and as a gesture to the only @entity119 native on board , chief steward @entity123			1
speaking on @entity10 television , @entity23 said the problem was an uncharted rock			0
" on the nautical chart , it was marked just as water , " @entity23 said			0
but the @entity10 coast guard said the waters where the ship ran aground were well - mapped			1
local fishermen say the island coast of @entity119 is known for its rocky seafloor			0
" every danger in this area is on the nautical chart , " coast guard capt. @entity137 said			0
" this is a place where a lot of people come for diving and sailing			0
... all the dangers are known			0
" local authorities and residents said they believe that after hitting the rock , which tore a hole in the hull , the ship sailed at least half a mile north			1
they believe @entity23 then turned the ship around toward land , where it toppled			1
in addition to questions over how @entity23 handled himself after the wreck , questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no " mayday " distress signal was sent			1
at one point after the ship struck the rock , the ship returned a radio call from port officials saying that all was well and the ship was suffering only a " technical problem , " according to the transcripts			0
@entity23 joined @entity96 in 2002 as a safety officer , served as a staff captain and was appointed captain in 2006 , according to the cruise line			1

" @entity23 had never been involved in an accident before , said @entity96 chairman @entity180			2
@entity180 also downplayed the possibility that alcohol may have played a role in the crash , saying he did not believe @entity23 drank , and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by @entity96			2
the captain 's attorney said in a statement monday that @entity23 was " shattered , dismayed , saddened for the loss of lives and strongly disturbed			1
" but , he said , @entity23 is " nonetheless comforted by the fact that he maintained during those moments the necessary lucidity to put in place a difficult emergency maneuver ... bringing the ship to shallow waters			1
" that move , @entity26 said , saved the lives of many passengers and crew members			1
captain and consultant @entity205 told @entity1 's @entity207 on tuesday night that he was " totally amazed " by @entity23 's actions			1
" he should have stayed on board that ship and coordinated the rescue attempts from the vessel			2

passenger @entity214 of @entity215 said crew members tried to assist passengers , but had no upper - level supervision			0
the scene around lifeboats , many of which could not be launched , was chaotic			0
