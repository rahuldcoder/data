-- at the end of last season on " @entity4 , " @entity1 finally had to cope with not getting what he wanted in his career			2
that 's not a problem @entity10 is dealing with these days			2
in addition to his two emmy nominations — one for playing @entity15 , the other for @entity16 in the gut - wrenching @entity18 movie " @entity19 " — @entity21 ' salary for " @entity4 " skyrocketed from $ 350,000 per episode to $ 1 million after a contract dispute that pushed back production on the eighth season			1
after a week - long delay , production began on aug. 6			2
@entity28 sees the whole brouhaha as a simple issue			1
" i always thought everything would be worked out by the start date [ july 30 ] , " he tells @entity0			1
" when it was n't , it certainly was n't a good feeling , but there was absolutely no getting around the fact that everything had to be dealt with and finished before we could get back			1
" he says reports of the dispute were overblown			1
" you see the word ' strike ' — ' they 're walking out ! ' — but there was nothing to walk out from , " he says with a laugh			0
" that 's always hard , because part of you wants to explain to people what 's really going on			0
' do n't worry , we 're not leaving , we want to do the show			1
' " as for all those zeroes ? " i came from a family in @entity59 who simply never spoke about money , " he says			0
" when suddenly everybody is guessing , or some even getting close , to the ballpark of what you 're earning — well , that 's interesting , that everyone knows what you make			0
it is what it is , and the job is so wonderful that those minor oddities are well worth the ride			0
" looking forward to the @entity74 , @entity28 has different feelings about his very different nominations			1
" to be nominated again for @entity4 , is at least as touching to me , if not more so now , than it was the first time , " he says			2
" look , i 'm only human and therefore there 's a part of me that 's waiting for people to say , ' enough of you ! ' " as for his nomination for " @entity19 , " " i would be lying if i said it did n't feel really good to know that people had seen and thought it was also good work , because again , it is such a different ball of wax from the life of @entity1			1
