-- it 's @entity2 , and the @entity4 village is in the mood -- at least that 's the story according to one champion athlete at this month 's games			2
slopestyle gold medalist @entity9 revealed she had to delete her account with online dating app @entity11 before her snowboard event in order to focus on the @entity15			1
" @entity11 in the @entity21 is next level , " the 23 - year - old from @entity18 , @entity16 said in an interview with the magazine @entity20 published wednesday			1
" it 's all athletes ! in the mountain village it 's all athletes			1
there are some cuties on there			2
" there was a point where i had to be like ok , this is way too distracting			1
i deleted my account to focus on the @entity15			1
" @entity11 is a matchmaking app for smartphones that facilitates communication between nearby users , prompting them to decide whether they like each other on the basis of a photograph and a brief profile			1
if two users select " like " for one another , the match is made known to both individuals and they can begin messaging			2
with most athletes owning smartphones and being active on social media , it was perhaps inevitable that the increasingly popular @entity11 would play @entity56 at the @entity15			1
in fact , the company has experienced a 400 % day - over - day increase of new users in @entity63 since the @entity8 began last friday , @entity11 ceo and founder @entity11 told the @entity64			1
with almost 3,000 competitors staying in the @entity21 alone , and that does n't include support staff , officials , media and fans who are all staying nearby			2
this diverse mix of people from all corners of the globe , for what is essentially one big party over a three - week period , is perhaps why organizers have seen fit to supply roughly 100,000 condoms to the @entity4 village			1
" i have n't seen it in action but i 've definitely heard the athletes ' village is a melting pot of good - looking people at the top of their sport , " @entity82 snowboarder @entity81 told reporters			1
" they do provide free condoms , which i think is a really smart move on their part			1
i think you can get them at the medical office			0
we 're good - looking people all hanging out together and stuff like that is bound to happen , " he added			0
fellow @entity82 @entity103 said while she had been staying offline in the run - up to her snowboard cross event on sunday , that was unlikely to remain the case for long			0
" i have n't gotten on @entity11 since i got here			1
i think after our event when we move up to the mountain ( athletes ' village ) i will definitely try to @entity11 it up , " the 21 - year - old said			1
but while some athletes have taken to modern technology in the search for that someone special in @entity63 , others have kept it old - school			2
the traditional definition of @entity2 , after all , is for couples and singles to express their love -- openly or anonymously -- through cards , candy , flowers and gifts			0
" if you have a girlfriend , you should tell her you love her every day , " said @entity131 snowboarder @entity130			0
" maybe when i get back to the athletes ' village i will find a chocolate heart from the cleaning lady			2
" @entity82 figure skater @entity137 went one step further and tweeted a @entity140 's card to herself , making light of her underwhelmed reaction to the judges ' scorecards after she performed in the team event last weekend -- an image that went viral			0
others are so focused on the competition , however , that @entity2 and the @entity11 factor have barely registered			1
@entity151 's @entity150 , who followed her 2010 halfpipe gold with silver in @entity63 , had to be reminded it was february 14			2
" oh , it 's @entity2 today ? " the snowboarder asked			0
" every day is @entity2			0
i give my love to all my loved ones every day			0
" well i do n't have a @entity140 , so i 'm just going to forget about it			0
" @entity160 snowboarder @entity159 , meanwhile , was none too enamored with the focus on anything other than the sport			0
" my plans for @entity2 is to go to the press conference , rest and get ready for tomorrow , " the 24 - year - old said			0
" it 's a day of preparation like any other			0
i 've got other things on my mind , it 's not my focus			0
