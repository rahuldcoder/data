editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is the broadband television network of vice			0
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- we had heard about a drug in @entity20 that essentially eliminates free - will in humans			1
it is called scopolamine and it seemed to us to be so completely out there -- like a plot device in an awful @entity29 movie			0
in fact , it sounded so horrible and strange that we wanted to go down and try it out			0
so the producers and i compiled a laundry list of embarrassing chores for me to complete while under the influence and , chuckling hysterically to ourselves , got on a plane and headed for @entity39 , @entity20			1
once we landed in the @entity20 capital , it took all of about 60 minutes to realize there was n't going to be any more laughing			1
the fear that the mere mention of scopolamine struck in the locals was palpable and startling			1
as we dug deeper into this drug 's story , following the evolution of the plant and its uses , we began to appreciate the gravity of ingesting it			1
we heard harrowing tales from victims and perpetrators alike , sat with prostitutes who calmly explained administering the drug to unsuspecting johns , and visited the home of a man who confessed in chilling detail to murdering someone who had dosed him with the drug			2
it was difficult to believe at times , but we spoke to countless law enforcement officials and medical professionals who verified all that we 'd heard , and who also expressed their frustration and fear with what they saw as a growing problem			2
see the rest of @entity20 devil 's breath at @entity9 after a week of chasing this story across the city , we were rattled			1
by the time we met up with our local contact , a dealer named @entity81 , i had little to no interest in going through with the plan as conceived			0
still , he bought a gram of the drug , and when he returned to the car and began to open it , all the horror stories of the week came rushing at me			1
it occurred to me we were sitting in a car full of expensive video equipment on the outskirts of @entity39 with a known drug dealer we had just met , and in his possession was arguably the most dangerous drug in the world			2
fortunately for us , @entity81 turned out to be a rather trustworthy drug dealer , and we made it out of @entity39 unscathed , our mental faculties intact , the scopolamine dispatched safely into a nearby toilet			2
we have not , however , been able to shake the stories we heard .			0

journalist heads to @entity20 to learn about drug , *originally* *intending* to try it
tone of story *quickly* changes upon hearing " *unimaginable* horror stories "
mere mention of the drug strikes " startling , " " palpable " fear in locals
