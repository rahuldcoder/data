-- in news that likely did n't surprise anyone , @entity1 announced tuesday that " @entity5 " was renewed for a fifth season			1
airing sunday nights , the zombie apocalypse show picked up 20.2 million viewers for its @entity10 premiere , a number that breaks records for nonsports telecasts on cable			1
situated right in the middle of this pop culture hoard of zombies is @entity18 , a makeup effects guru			1
he 's a director and executive producer on the show			1
in 1988 , @entity18 co-founded @entity23 group , a popular effects studio for film and tv , and went on to establish a reputation in @entity28			1
long before he joined @entity29 , " @entity5 " comic book creator , and @entity31 , show creator , @entity18 launched his career as a student of zombie icons @entity35 and @entity36			1
@entity18 , who still runs @entity23 , has now become involved in the theme park business by acting as a consultant for @entity40 's " @entity5 " attraction at their @entity42 event			1
( it 's also represented in part at @entity28			1
zombie 101 with @entity18 shortly before the news about @entity46 was official , @entity18 spoke to @entity0 via phone to discuss his outlook on the future of " @entity5 , " the theme park attraction and the hidden tributes he sneaks into episodes he directs : @entity0 : having spoken with you before , you strike me as someone always striving to learn new techniques			1
what do you find yourself looking at for the show 's future ? @entity18 : i appreciate you saying that because every season when i watch the show , i 'm constantly looking at what i feel people responded to and what people like , and what i thought was successful or could be refined			1
a show like " @entity5 " gives us that opportunity to refine the look of the @entity70 and the performances			1
we have the opportunity to play with the concepts , the designs , the sculptures			1
every year we 're able to do that and it 's exciting			1
@entity0 : what are some new things you 've learned to bring into " @entity5 " moving forward ? @entity18 : when you make something for a movie , when it 's done filming , you remove the prosthetics and throw it away			1
for these guys ( at @entity40 ] , they build it for a completely different mindset			2
there have been things they 've done that i 've been like , : wow , that 's really smart , i wish i 'd thought of that			2
" for example , they will put magnets inside the teeth and magnets inside the prosthetics			2
so the teeth do n't clip onto the actor 's teeth but the teeth attach inside the prosthetic , so you do n't have to put custom dentures into every single performer			2
that 's a really neat idea because , for background stuff , you do n't need to worry about putting teeth into all of them			2
i think that works really well			2
photos : key characters killed on ' @entity5 ' @entity0 : as the show progresses each season , and becomes increasingly successful , is there pressure because people expect more from the show , and because it receives additional attention ? @entity18 : i think we put the pressure on ourselves to raise the bar			1
@entity128 and i have had many conversations about that -- about our commitment to the show , our passion and our commitment to the fans			2
i am really proud of @entity136 and where the show is going			2
the fact that viewers have responded very positively is rewarding because we fought very hard to make sure the show continues every season to raise the bar			1
we 're all creative , passionate people -- every single crew member and actor on the show wants it to be better			2
our show runner , @entity144 , is a fan first and a great writer second , so i feel like we all challenge each other			2
i do n't know if " pressure " is the right word , but we feel an obligation to continue to make the show great			2
@entity0 : when @entity40 first approached you about bringing " @entity5 " to a theme park , was there any hesitation ? @entity18 : no , as a matter of fact , it was quite the opposite			1
the show has been able to attract quite a significant fan base , and what interested me in this collaboration was giving fans a little more of an interactive experience			2
what @entity40 has been able to do is put fans directly in the middle of the experience			2
you get to walk through the hallways of the prison , see @entity172 's barn , all these really exciting moments			0
it 's like the greatest hits of the show			0
being able to do this is an exciting endeavor			0
@entity0 : was there a concern about quality control since the @entity70 in the park are based on your design , but you 're not there to manage it ? @entity18 : i 'm not there on a day - to - day basis , but i have interacted and consulted with @entity191 and his creative team in regards to all of the sculptures			1
i provided them with photos of a lot of sculptures we did at @entity23			0
they replicated a lot of the stuff we did			0
in a few instances , like with @entity205 's pets , i sent them actual prosthetic pieces used on the show so their sculptors could duplicate , as close as possible , the work we did on the show			0
i really was involved in that capacity			0
@entity0 : what do you think the appeal is of theme park guests walking through " @entity5 " ? @entity220 : i am a movie fan			1
i 've flown to @entity222 to see where they shot " @entity224			0
" i have been to the @entity225 to see where they shot " @entity227 , " been to the steps in " @entity229 " where @entity230 falls down the steps			0
i have been that guy who has been to those locations because it connects me to the material i love so much			0
that 's what everybody does when they go to @entity40			0
they 're going to connect themselves to the experience , and they now know what it 's like to be on the set of " @entity5			1
" fans will seek out those experiences			0
@entity0 : has the success of " @entity5 " added to the awareness of @entity35 's work , or do you feel like you need to encourage people to look back to " @entity254 " and his other films ? @entity18 : that 's a great question , and i 'm very glad you asked that			1
i saw @entity35 about two weeks ago in @entity260			0
there was a 30th anniversary screening of " @entity263 , " and i went and had n't seen @entity35 in about two years			0
the guy , in my opinion , is a genius			0
he was the guy that got me into the business			0
" @entity227 " and " @entity224 " teeter back - and - forth as the number one movie that i loved , and which influenced me			0
before 1968 ( when " @entity254 " came out ) , zombies were strictly referred to as a voodoo character , not even an undead but under a spell			0
he created a new creature ; they came back from the dead , eat the flesh of the living and you shoot them in the head to kill them			0
as far as i 'm concerned , " @entity5 " would n't exist without @entity35			1
... @entity29 's comic book is really a love letter to @entity35			0
his movies were so groundbreaking that they influenced guys like me and @entity29 and @entity31			0
when i saw him two weeks ago , i was still geeking out			0
@entity0 : now you 're serving as a frequent director on " @entity5 , " so how does that make you think differently about your past effects work ? @entity18 : i think about things differently because i did come up in the ranks of the makeup effects world			1
when i get to direct episodes now , what 's fun is i throw little tributes in there			1
we did a cameo of the airport zombie from " @entity227 " with the plaid shirt in @entity307 last year			0
i get to put those little in - jokes in			0
i 'm directing @entity307 15 , and i 'm popping in a few tributes			1
the thing i love the most is i 've been doing this 30 years , and every day i come to work and still learn more			0
it really is the ultimate position , creatively , for me .			0
