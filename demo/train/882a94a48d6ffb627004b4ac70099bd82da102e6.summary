@entity2 celebrated his moonwalk here			2
and @entity5 faced off against @entity6 here			2
in its heyday , the world 's first indoor stadium knew how to throw a party			1
and it paved the way for multi-use , publicly subsidized sports facilities getting built across the @entity15			0
now the @entity16 has hit the big time , as far as historic buildings go			0
the dome has been listed on the @entity20 , a designation announced by the @entity22 last week			1
the listing makes it eligible for tax breaks should the building be rehabilitated but is otherwise mostly honorary			0
can a 20th - century sports stadium be a " historic place ? " the @entity16 " was bold and modern , and it marked the enormous ambition @entity40 had in the 1960 's and 70 's , when , thanks to air conditioning becoming cheap and plentiful , [ @entity40 ] believed there were no obstacles to its becoming one of the major cities of the world , " wrote architecture critic @entity29 , contributor to @entity31 , winner of the @entity32 for his architecture criticism at the @entity34 and author of " @entity36 , " via email			1
" i 'm all for saving sports facilities that have genuine historic and architectural value , which the @entity16 does , " wrote @entity29			0
" things this big are n't easy to re-use , of course , and there is no doubt that figuring out a viable future for the @entity16 is a huge challenge			0
but it definitely meets the standard of being a landmark			0
" 6 imperiled and extinct sports sites that 's why the @entity63 included the stadium on its 2013 list of " most endangered " places , along with a military club for @entity69 officers , @entity15 's first permanent @entity71 settlement and an unused airline terminal			1
" many people perceive places built during living memory , or just before , differently than they do older places , and too often value them less , " said @entity73 , the @entity63 's president , via e-mail			2
" we see more and more midcentury icons slowly fading away until demolition seems inevitable , " said @entity73			0
" we must preserve these @entity83 buildings not only because they represent @entity15 's ingenuity and space - age determination , but because they challenge -- and expand -- our sense of what is worth saving in this country			2
" opened in 1965 as home to the @entity90 and the then - @entity91 , the @entity16 has n't had a sports team to call its own since 1999			0
used as a refuge for people fleeing @entity96 in 2005 , the stadium had a sale in november to sell off @entity98 ( first installed at the @entity16 and named in its honor ) , stadium seating and other parts			1
the storied stadium was the site of tennis great @entity5 's 1973 " @entity106 " with @entity6 , a historic and much - hyped victory of woman over man in sports			1
@entity4 played the @entity16 in 1970 , @entity2 celebrated his moon mission there in 1969 and @entity1 successfully defended his world heavyweight champion title against @entity114 at the stadium in 1966			1
preservationists are scrambling to save the stadium , which is structurally sound and significant in the world of sports -- but also a bit of a local eyesore			1
local voters rejected a $ 217 million november bond initiative to save the county - owned stadium and turn it into a convention center			2
