-- an @entity2 reservation in @entity3 voted to repeal a decades - old ban on alcohol , according to preliminary results announced by the @entity7 wednesday			1
the unofficial tally from tuesday 's vote at @entity10 shows that 1,645 members voted in favor of lifting the ban , 1,494 voted against and 438 votes were challenged			1
" @entity18 votes are being counted and will be released as soon as they are received from the election committee , " the @entity16 website said			2
@entity10 is the last dry reservation in the state			1
the debate about allowing alcohol on the reservation divided the community			1
the ban , in effect for decades , prohibits the possession and consumption of alcohol on the reservation			1
but the ban was n't working , @entity32 , one of nine @entity7 tribal council members who agreed to put the issue to a vote , said before the balloting			1
@entity32 compared the situation to the @entity40 ' prohibition era			0
" it did n't work then , " he said			0
" it created a criminal element			0
" others were firm in their commitment to keep the land dry , saying legalizing alcohol would solve nothing			0
" alcohol is behind every social problem we have , " said activist and tribe member @entity50			1
" it 's our biggest enemy -- legalizing it wo n't solve the problem			0
" she cites problems such as domestic abuse , assault , rape and unemployment			0
she added that drinking is killing the population : " it 's liquid genocide			0
" what both sides agree on is that alcohol abuse is common on the reservation and beer is easy to get			1
the neighboring border town of @entity74 , @entity75 , is home to fewer than 15 residents but supports four beer stores that manage to sell 11,000 cans of beer a day to their predominately @entity82 customer base			2
the reservation has a tribal membership of more than 35,000 people , according to the @entity16 website			0
many of those who purchase beer in @entity74 drink it there and return to the reservation drunk			0
other times the beer is smuggled into the reservation			0
if the vote holds up and the ban is lifted , the tribe would be able to establish its own beer stores on the reservation			1
@entity32 says each district would house one store -- operated by the tribe -- with profits going toward alcohol rehabilitation facilities			2
in the long term , @entity32 said , stores on the reservation could eventually shut down the @entity74 operations .			2
