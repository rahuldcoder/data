-- champion cyclist @entity2 wo n't be allowed to compete in international @entity4 triathlon contests while he 's under investigation for doping , the @entity1 announced thursday			1
the ruling bars him from the @entity4 @entity10 competition scheduled for june 24 in @entity11 , the agency said			0
the decision comes after the @entity13 , or @entity13 , confirmed wednesday that it is opening proceedings against @entity2 and five former teammates			1
@entity2 said wednesday the agency intends to " dredge up discredited " doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven @entity20 victories			1
the champion cyclist has always insisted he never took performance - enhancing drugs			0
@entity2 was accused of using such drugs by other riders , but never failed a drug test			1
@entity2 started doing triathlons after retiring from cycling , and won a half - @entity4 in @entity28 less than two weeks ago			2
he was the fastest cyclist and runner on the 70.3 - mile course , and the third - fastest swimmer			0
but with the new investigation open , the @entity1 suspended him			2
@entity1 rules " dictate an athlete is ineligible to compete during an open investigation			1
@entity2 is therefore suspended from competing in @entity1 - owned and licensed races pending further review , " the organization said in a statement			1
@entity41 said he can still compete in its events			1
" @entity2 is currently still eligible to compete in all @entity41 - sanctioned races , with the exception of @entity4 events as stated earlier by the @entity1 , " said the body 's communications director @entity43			1
@entity2 lashed out at his accusers and the doping agency on wednesday			1
" unlike many of my accusers , i have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance , passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one , " @entity2 said on his website			1
" that @entity13 ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about @entity13 , its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence			2
" a 15 - page agency letter was sent tuesday to @entity2 and several others			2
the @entity67 was the first to report the story			0
@entity70 prosecutors in february said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against @entity2			2
they had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in @entity75 , but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that @entity2 used performance - enhancing drugs			1
" these are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the @entity70 chose not to pursue after a two - year investigation , " @entity2 said wednesday			2
in the letter , a copy of which was obtained by @entity0 , the @entity13 said it collected blood samples from @entity2 in 2009 and 2010 that were " fully consistent with blood manipulation including @entity87 use and / or blood transfusions			1
" @entity87 , or erythropoietin , boosts the number of blood cells			0
opinion : why fans should n't forgive @entity2 the letter said @entity2 and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011			2
riders will testify that @entity2 used @entity87 , blood transfusions , testosterone and masking agents , and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005 , according to the letter			0
in a statement obtained by @entity0 , @entity13 ceo @entity104 said the five other people , formerly associated with the @entity108 pro cycling team , are three team doctors and two team officials			0
the letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations , @entity104 said " @entity13 only initiates matters supported by the evidence , " @entity104 said			1
" we do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures , intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence			0
" all named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise , he added			0
according to its website , the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity129 events in the @entity130			0
@entity2 said the organization has " self - written rules " and punishes first and adjudicates the facts later			0
@entity2 has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years , with compatriot @entity136 -- who was found guilty of doping in the @entity137 , resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year			1
@entity2 came out fighting once again in may 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the @entity144 " @entity143 " show by another @entity130 , @entity146			0
in the @entity144 interview , @entity146 -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw @entity2 use blood boosting @entity87 in 1999 , the year of his first @entity20 victory			0
" i saw it in his refrigerator , " @entity146 told the @entity130 news program			0
" i saw him inject it more than one time like we all did , like i did many , many times			0
" on his @entity158 page , @entity2 at the time said he never failed a drug test			1
ex-teammate : i saw @entity2 inject banned substances @entity0 's @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 contributed to this report .			0
