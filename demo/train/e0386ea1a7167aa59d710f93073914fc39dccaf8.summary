we all know the feeling			2
you are going about your day , making phone calls and texting , when suddenly your smartphone 's battery starts to look dangerously low			0
you do n't have a charger with you , and even if you did , there would be nowhere to plug it in			1
for most people , this means spending a few hours unconnected -- but not for residents of several towns and cities in @entity14			1
they can charge their phones on the go thanks to @entity18 , the first of its kind public solar - powered charging station , installed in parks and squares across the country			1
conceived by @entity24 in 2011 while he was still a student at @entity25 , @entity18 contains 16 chargers for a variety of mobile phones and tablets , as well as its own wi - fi and usb sockets			1
his creation won the @entity34 startup competition in @entity35 at the end of october -- the only company from outside @entity38 to take part -- and already boasts the @entity40			1
" we rely heavily on our cell phones for many essential tasks during the day , " says @entity24 , now 26 , who founded his company , @entity41 , when he received the first order for his charger			1
" you communicate over your cell phone , you are using maps , taking photos , so basically your phone becomes your life			0
it 's a huge problem when you run out of battery because then you are just carrying a brick in your pocket , " he adds			0
@entity18 , named so after the symbolism of strawberries as the first fruit of the summer , can work for up to 20 days without sunlight thanks to its in - built solar batteries			1
it contains reused steel , and 98 % of it can be recycled			0
" i was fascinated with clean technology , and i wanted to find a way that it could benefit people in their everyday life by solving a common problem -- running out of battery , " says @entity24			0
while replenishing cell phone batteries is the device 's main function , @entity24 wants @entity18 to become a core item of infrastructure in what he calls a smart , connected city of the future			0
each charger is equipped with sensors which measure conditions like air pollution , noise levels , and uv radiation in its vicinity			2
@entity24 says he hopes these sensors could in the future enable people to access locally - focused environmental data though an app on their smartphone			2
" for example , if you had a network of @entity92 spread around the city , you could check if there 's ice on the road in your street , what park is the quietest if you want to relax , " explains @entity24 , " or if you have asthma or allergies , you could see what 's the air quality in the area you 're planning to go to , " he adds			1
the company 's ambitious plans do n't stop there			2
after @entity14 was hit by devastating floods in may , large swathes of the country lost power preventing many people from contacting their families for several days			1
@entity24 thinks that his creation could become an invaluable resource in similar scenarios			0
" @entity18 could have an emergency button which would send a signal to emergency services that you are in danger , and in any kind of a disaster , for example if the power grid is down , the tree would be the place where you could call for help and get in touch with your loved ones , " he adds			0
@entity24 also stresses that in spite of the dramatic changes in the way that people communicate in the last 50 years , cities have remained almost frozen in time : " street signs are still street signs , city lights are only city lights , and benches are still just benches			0
there is hardly any innovation in city living , so our dream is to bring new technology to outdoor public spaces , so we can improve the quality of life in our cities , " he says			2
