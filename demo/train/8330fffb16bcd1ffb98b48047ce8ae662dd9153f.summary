-- world number one @entity1 insists he is fully prepared for a punishing schedule leading up to the defense of his @entity6 title at @entity6 in a month 's time			1
the @entity9 had little time to celebrate his record - breaking victory over @entity12 in the @entity13 on sunday , before flying home to participate in the @entity15			1
fresh from his landmark seventh successive @entity18 title , @entity1 has two more tournaments in the diary after @entity15 before he aims to claim a sixth title in @entity22			1
but despite his history of injuries , the 24 - year - old claims he is fit and ready for a bruising lead - in to the second major tennis championship of the year			2
" during the match i was more tired than usual			2
but in general it was positive , " he told the official @entity30 web site			2
" that 's important because these kinds of matches improve your condition physically and mentally			2
" it 's negative because you spent a lot of time on court , you have to run a lot on court , it 's always tough for the body			1
but if you talk about [ what it does ] mentally and physically , that can help a lot for the rest of the clay season			0
" @entity1 has played 17 matches in the last four weeks but is due to appear at masters events in @entity53 and @entity54 after defending his @entity15 title			1
the 24 - year - old has a formidable record at the event he has won five times , tasting defeat just once in 25 matches , and says this is a vital period in shaping his season			1
" that 's the calendar			0
that 's where i have to play my best , where i have to defend a lot of points , " @entity1 said			1
" @entity70 to @entity71 is the most [ important ] part of the season for me			0
these four or five months are decisive in my season			0
" every year i did a fantastic clay court season			0
i have to try to do it another time			2
with these four or five tournaments , if i am playing very well , i 'm going to have the biggest chances to have enough points to try to be in the top position at the end of the year ranking			0
" that 's the top of my system in general			0
so i have to try			0
i am healthy now , so why not ? " despite his victory in @entity13 , @entity1 says there are areas of his game he needs to work on -- something he is aiming to do when he faces the winner of the first round clash between @entity92 and @entity93			1
" i think i can improve a few things for next weeks , " @entity1 said			1
" i am sliding less than usual on clay			0
it is easier to defend well when you are sliding , especially to the forehand			0
but i have two more days to practice for @entity15			1

@entity1 *unconcerned* by busy schedule leading up to the @entity6
@entity1 won the @entity13 for the seventh time on sunday
he flew *straight* to his *native* @entity105 to participate in the @entity15
the world number one says there are still areas of his game that can be improved
