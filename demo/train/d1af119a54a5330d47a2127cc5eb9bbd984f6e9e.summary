-- this is what party modernization looks like			0
last friday , sen. @entity4 of @entity5 announced he is now a supporter of the freedom to marry			2
what changed his thinking after voting against gay rights in the past ? finding out that his son -- a @entity12 sophomore -- was gay , and realizing that sexual orientation is not a choice but an innate quality			0
" i have come to believe that if two people are prepared to make a lifetime commitment to love and care for each other in good times and in bad , the government should n't deny them the opportunity to get married , " he said			0
@entity4 's change of heart is significant because he is the highest - ranking elected @entity23 in @entity24 , who is currently in office , to endorse same - sex marriage			1
but he joins a growing number of republicans who have already done just that			0
indeed , @entity4 is just the latest addition to an increasingly common occurrence in @entity23 politics at the county , city and state level			2
to date 208 elected @entity23 state legislators have voted to legalize same - sex marriage in 13 states : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
only nine states and the @entity51 allow same - sex marriage , but @entity23 elected officials have voted for marriage when it came up for vote in their legislative chambers in @entity41 , @entity52 and @entity49 , though the law has n't yet passed in those states			1
@entity62 : gay people live in 50 @entity64 the conservative argument for marriage includes a recognition of the traditional value of marriage as a stabilizing force in society			1
another , economic argument holds that married individuals tend to accumulate more wealth than single individuals ( putting them at lesser risk of state dependency ) , not to mention that marriage produces more government revenue through taxation			2
@entity82 's ban on same - sex marriage cost @entity84 $ 37.2 million per year in receipts , according to @entity86 , chief economist in the @entity87			1
the elected officials who support same - sex marriage are surfing a rapidly rising tide among @entity23 rank - and - file			1
a new @entity93 / @entity92 shows that 52 % of @entity23 younger than 50 support same - sex marriage			1
there are good reasons for this			0
conservative faith traditions argue rightly for strict religious protections in the law so that churches , synagogues and mosques are n't forced to perform ceremonies inconsistent with their religious teachings			0
but @entity24 ' diverse religious backgrounds have the @entity107 in common , and conservatives in favor of civil marriage argue that it is consistent with faith traditions for @entity23 policies to treat others , including gays and lesbians , with the same level of respect and fairness under the law that we wish for ourselves			2
constitutional conservatives point to the role of the courts in protecting fundamental rights			0
they argue that marriage is such a right , enshrined in the constitution , and one that can not be subject to the whims or tyranny of a majority of voters , even if they were to wish to limit the freedoms of gay and lesbians			2
more and more republicans are recognizing and respecting the essential dignity of individuals who are gay and deserve the full rights of citizenship , just like their straight brothers and sisters			0
opinion : gay marriage , then group marriage ? these are the messages that last november brought @entity23 and independents to the voting booth in @entity45 , @entity42 and @entity51 , where same - sex marriage was approved for the first time by voters , not courts or legislatures			1
minnesotans , who rejected a constitutional ban on same - sex marriage in november , are now poised to legalize marriage this legislative season , with the historic distinction of bipartisan support : @entity23 state sen. @entity164 is a co-sponsor of the bill			1
the timing of @entity4 's announcement is no accident			0
in less than a week , @entity170 , @entity171 's solicitor general and a charter member of the conservative @entity173 , will argue before the @entity174 that same - sex couples have a constitutional right to marry			2
accompanying him is an amicus brief , signed by 135 prominent @entity23 , ( i was also a co-signer ) making the conservative case for same - sex marriage , an effort organized by former @entity183 chair @entity182			1
it 's hard to imagine that the justices are n't taking notes on our country 's rapid transformation on this issue			0
the final safe haven within the conservative movement for anti-gay bigotry -- the @entity196 's @entity195 convention , held last week in @entity45 -- received more than a few hearty smackdowns			0
the editors of @entity199 , the conservative movement 's founding publication , chided @entity195 's exclusion of gay conservatives , which was followed by a convention panel hosted by the @entity205 entitled , " a @entity206 on the @entity207 : growing the @entity210 , bringing @entity211 " ( full disclosure : i spoke on that panel )			0
listen : voices from the @entity214 closet finally , the conservative intellectual pillar @entity216 took the @entity195 stage to argue that the conservative movement must accept same - sex marriage if it wishes to win elections in the future			1
the data are inescapable : 62 % of all @entity23 believe in either same - sex marriage or another form of legal recognition of same - sex relationships and 73 % of @entity23 support employment nondiscrimination protections for gays and lesbians			1
at this point , the support for same - sex marriage from former vice president @entity232 , former first lady @entity233 and former secretary of state @entity234 is icing on the cake			1
in the words of @entity4 , this is less a partisan issue than a generational issue			0
@entity4 embodies the formula for @entity23 modernization : a conservatism that unapologetically applies the principle of individual freedom consistently to both fiscal and social policy			2
the senator has breathed new life into a national party grasping for traction with young @entity24			0
to regain relevance , the beltway 's @entity23 establishment organizations owe a debt of gratitude to leaders like @entity4 , @entity257 and @entity47 rep. @entity258 for representing their family 's and friends ' right to equal freedom and opportunity			1
they , and others like them , are making the case for a relevant modern conservative movement			0
pro-marriage - freedom @entity23 are on the right side of history and in time their courage and contributions will help erase the stain of bigotry that holds the conservative movement back and stops us from connecting to a rising generation of @entity24			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280			0

@entity280 : sen. @entity4 most recent @entity282 to support same - sex marriage
she says conservative values , *golden* rule allow more in @entity23 to accept change
she says more in @entity23 see marriage as stabilizing force , good for economy
@entity294 : to regain relevance with voters , the @entity23 must reject bigotry that holds it back
