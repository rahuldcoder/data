-- as the @entity3 works with @entity4 and @entity5 to sustain @entity7 peace talks , another diplomatic effort to forge a two - state solution is quietly but quickly moving to the center of @entity3 foreign policy			1
in about 100 days , the people of @entity11 are to vote on whether to declare independence from the government in @entity14			1
that deadline was set when the two sides signed the @entity17 of 2005 , which promised this option			0
there is little suspense as to the outcome : every reliable source indicates that @entity11 will vote for separation , dividing @entity25 's largest country and taking with it some 80 percent of known @entity28 oil reserves			1
no , the critical choice that leaders in both @entity32 face is between a future of peaceful coexistence or a return to chaos and war in a place tragically familiar with both			1
while there are obviously differences , these situations in the @entity7 and @entity11 have more in common than the painful process of division			1
each features disputes over land and resources , religious and ethnic differences , and conflicting narratives of bloodshed and loss			0
time is a critical element in every peace process			1
and with its referendum fast approaching , @entity11 , too , faces the tyranny of the onrushing calendar			2
the deadline for the @entity62 referendum promised in the peace agreement , january 9 , 2011 , is not negotiable			0
but exactly how the @entity64 will simultaneously separate while remaining interconnected must be			0
@entity11 may possess most of the known petroleum reserves , but the pipelines to market for that oil run through the @entity32			1
millions of @entity62 displaced by the war will continue to live in @entity14 , and @entity69 will live in the @entity11			2
every dry season , herders from the @entity32 's @entity72 tribes cross into what will likely become the country of @entity11 and then return			1
the @entity76 will continue to flow northward , regardless of borders and politics			0
boundaries must simultaneously be demarcated and accommodating			0
and the parties need to finalize the details fast enough to ensure that violence can not fill the vacuum			0
the last war between @entity32 lasted for decades and claimed millions of lives			2
earlier this year , then - director of national intelligence @entity86 told @entity88 that , over the next five years , @entity11 is the place where " a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur			1
" and while we try to prevent the next potential wave of genocide , we can not ignore the fact that @entity97 's tragedy remains unresolved			2
even as @entity3 asks how it can help @entity11 prepare for the likely burdens of statehood , it must also consider the @entity11 that remains			2
attention to @entity97 must not be a casualty of our necessary fixation on the @entity11 crisis			1
recognizing the urgency of the situation , the administration has launched a heightened campaign of diplomatic engagement			0
president @entity110 joined @entity112 secretary - general @entity111 and vice president @entity113 of the @entity32 and @entity114 , leader of the @entity11 , in @entity115 last week to highlight the imperatives of peace , while he has also reinforced the @entity3 diplomatic presence in the region			1
@entity88 must also weigh in			2
i have written legislation to put @entity88 on record to reinforce the @entity3 commitment to see the peace agreement through , to lay the groundwork for what will come and to reinvigorate the @entity97 peace process			1
one painful lesson from years of @entity7 peacemaking is that even when the elements that will constitute an accord may seem clear from the outside , the compromises and choices that will make it possible are difficult to accept , sequence and execute			0
time in @entity11 is short and the stakes are high			0
although the @entity28 themselves will own their future , @entity3 must now help @entity141 to find a peaceful path forward			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145 .			0

@entity145 : @entity11 likely to vote for independence , raising *specter* of more war with @entity32
@entity88 must commit to laying groundwork for peace between @entity32 , he writes
senator says the situation *resembles* @entity7 in its *complexity* and *pitfalls*
commitment to revive peace process in @entity97 also essential , @entity145 writes
