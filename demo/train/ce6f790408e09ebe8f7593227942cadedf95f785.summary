@entity0 -- amid a glowing sea of candles and rallying calls for justice , a record crowd packed six football pitches at an annual vigil held in @entity0 to commemorate the 23rd anniversary of the 1989 @entity11 crackdown			1
organizers announced the highest ever turnout of 180,000 people , while police said the figure was closer to 85,000			1
by even the most conservative estimates , there were 15,000 more attendees than last year			0
while the vigil typically features singing , speeches , video messages and tributes , the clear highlight of this year 's event was a special appearance by @entity28 , a former student protester who had both his legs amputated after he was run over by an army tank during the crackdown			1
wheeled onto the center of the stage , @entity28 , now 46 , effusively thanked the crowd for " twenty - three years of support			1
" over june 3 to 4 , 1989 , @entity37 troops used lethal force to quash a seven - week - long occupation of @entity40 's @entity11 by pro-democracy protesters , who were largely comprised of students			1
estimates of the numbers killed range from hundreds to thousands of protesters and soldiers			0
in an outpouring of compassion , a continued sense of injustice , and fears for the future , the vigil attracted a broad spectrum of mourners , ranging from people born after the crackdown to elderly residents who have dutifully come every year			1
the annual vigil in @entity0 is the only public commemoration of its kind and scale allowed within @entity37 's borders			1
volunteer @entity64 , 7 , handed out bookmarks to passersby at the @entity68 booth alongside her mother			0
" many people died so i 'm here to pay my respects , " she said			0
further down @entity72 , a 27 - year - old man surnamed @entity74 held up subversive t - shirts for sale			0
although he was only four years old at the time of the crackdown , @entity74 said he chose to volunteer his services with his friends monday to " show his opposition toward the @entity83 and its disregard for the law			2
" @entity86 , 17 , has attended the vigil for the past three years out of a sense of civic responsibility			2
" even though i was n't alive during june 4 , we need to take the initiative to stand up for our rights and tell our citizens that we have the responsibility to say no to the @entity83			0
" the @entity95 who took to the stage echoed his sentiment , declaring , " our pain and suffering is the same as that of our parents			0
" sitting on bleachers with group of elderly men holding lighted candles in paper cones , 73 - year - old @entity104 - tin said he has been coming to the vigils nearly every year since 1989			1
@entity104 , who emigrated from the mainland at age 12 , called the @entity11 massacre " the most apparent example in @entity37 's history of the strong bullying the weak			1
" he says he continues to be " very angry and unsettled by these corrupt officials who are harming our country and harming the world			0
" ms. @entity120 said she still has a deep impression of attending a protest in 1989 against the crackdown alongside thousands of @entity125 in @entity126			2

@entity0 's new chief executive , @entity132 , is due to take office on the first of july after being chosen to lead the special administrative region of @entity37			2
the lack of universal suffrage and uneasiness over the mainland government 's influence over local affairs have long been contentious issues in @entity0			2
@entity132 is perceived by some to take a hard - line approach toward public freedoms			0
he has been criticized in recent days for refusing to comment on the vigil and the massacre			0
@entity37 has also encountered multiple political scandals in the run - up to the once - in - a - decade @entity83 leadership change this fall , most notably the murky corruption - cum - murder case involving disgraced @entity152 party chief @entity151 , and the fleeing of blind human rights activist @entity154 to the @entity155 " all problems need to be solved ; evasion is not a way out , " @entity154 said , in an open letter urging the @entity37 government to institute democratic reforms and address the @entity11 incident			2
his letter was posted to the website of the vigil 's organizer , the @entity167 in @entity168 of @entity37			0
during monday 's vigil , @entity170 chairman @entity169 took to the stage to lead the crowd in chants of " never forget june 4 ! " , " redress june 4 ! " , " persevere to the end ! " @entity177 said that more than 10,000 visitors had already passed through the temporary @entity11 memorial museum in @entity180 , which opened in late april			1
