-- @entity1 recently sallied forth with a series of attacks on @entity4 that had the desired effect			1
it stirred up the @entity10 base of the @entity11			1
and it really irritated the @entity4 camp			1
it has produced waves of condemnation because of the unsubstantiated assertions that @entity4 did n't pay taxes for a decade			1
@entity19 , head of the @entity20 , called @entity1 " a dirty liar			1
" democrats responded that this was a problem @entity4 brought on himself			1
all he would have to do is release his tax returns to end the dust - up			2
but of course , this is one dust - up that will never end			2
because in modern politics it seems the goal is to constantly find ways to smear the opposition , facts and decency be damned			1
that 's the reason the birther lie endures			2
that 's the reason that @entity40 , whose military service was distinguished , could be besmirched by the " swift boaters " and a host of political opponents who had n't anything like his record of service			2
and because both sides do it to one another , it is considered to be fair play			1
only in politics can what 's clearly foul be fair			1
news : @entity1 puts @entity57 in a bind over @entity4 's taxes support his policies or oppose them , no one is for one minute suggesting that @entity4 did anything other than obey the tax laws of the @entity64			1
the reason that @entity11 want to see the tax returns is not because they think he did something wrong but because he did something that might look unseemly			2
like he was a rich guy taking advantage of loopholes			2
that virtually anyone in his position would do so is irrelevant			2
it 's all about the smear			1
the same is true with the attacks on @entity4 's tenure at @entity78			1
@entity4 is not being attacked for breaking the law ( except by a few semanticists , who seem to be @entity81 vely , yet deliberately , suggesting it was not possible for him to be chairman on paper but to be taking a leave of absence from daily operating responsibilities )			1
he is being attacked because it might look bad that companies he was involved with actually outsourced jobs or fired people			0
that he was fulfilling his responsibility to his shareholders in doing so and that the record of @entity94 was fairly good in terms of value creation is irrelevant when the objective is creating a negative narrative at all costs			0
i have voted @entity101 all my life			0
i served in the @entity104 administration and worked for a @entity11 congressman on @entity106			0
i will vote for president @entity107			1
but i deplore these tactics			1
opinion : why wo n't @entity4 release more tax returns ? when @entity1 goes on the floor of the @entity112 and makes assertions like he did , he demeans the institution			1
which is saying something about an institution that is as dysfunctional as the @entity112			0
when the @entity107 team systematically goes after @entity4 for his business background , it makes sense as a political tactic , but it reveals deep insecurity about his case for re-election and it alienates the business community unnecessarily			1
as my old boss , the late @entity127 , the former chairman of the @entity128 , used to say , " you ca n't be for jobs and against the people who create them			0
" @entity64 is facing unprecedented challenges			1
our economy does n't work the way it once did			0
it is growing more slowly			0
it is rebounding from crisis more slowly			0
it is not creating jobs as it has			0
it is not creating wealth for the population at large the way it used to			0
our competitiveness is faltering even as competition is growing			0
yet we have great opportunities before us			1
a new energy mix can free us of dependency on dangerous nations , create jobs and a cleaner environment at home			0
our economy is well poised to lead a " @entity160 , " driven by high value - added manufacturing in which intellectual capital , the kind we create especially well , is the critical input			0
we protect that capital better than many of our competitors , too			0
we 're in a position to remake our infrastructure , as must be done thanks to very low interest rates , if only we could come to understand the difference between spending and investing			0
we need to rethink our convoluted tax structure , our broken fiscal system , our corrupt campaign finance system and the way we defend ourselves and project our force worldwide			0
it is beyond arguing that we need to do something about gun control in this country			0
these are great issues calling for serious debate			1
and we actually have two candidates for president who are credible , serious men			2
but they are running a campaign that has the sensibilities and iq of a typical middle school student council election			0
with the values of an episode of " @entity195 " or " @entity196			0
" apparently , the candidates and their advisers think that is what will work with us			2
they think we do n't see the big problems , care about them or understand them			0
they think that throwing mud and unsubstantiated claims and getting bogged down in distractions will tip the scales in their favor			0
so the sad punch line to all this pettiness is that in a campaign laden with name calling , the biggest insult of all is the one that is being directed at the @entity64 people			1
amid all the dirt and the shallowness , this is the one that should produce the greatest outrage			0
but of all of them , it 's also the only one that could produce any good at all			0
it could get us to act and demand more and to reject negative campaigns			2
every time you hear a politician sling mud at an opponent rather than addressing a real issue , recognize that you 're the one being dissed			2
then do us all a favor and vote your anger			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			1

@entity237 : @entity1 made attacks on @entity4 that riled *anti-romney* base and @entity4 , too
in modern politics , both sides smear , call it fair play ; he backs @entity107 , deplores these tactics
he says @entity64 facing huge challenges , opportunities ; both candidates should debate these
@entity237 : voters must recognize smears as *disrespectful* to them , demand better , vote their anger
