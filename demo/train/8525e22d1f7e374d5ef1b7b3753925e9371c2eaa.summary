@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has been given a year to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal , or face the threat of a @entity7 military strike			1
yet it may come as a surprise that the @entity7 has still not destroyed all of its massive supply of deadly nerve agents			2
in fact , neither has @entity14			0
both @entity15 and @entity16 signed the @entity17 of the 1990s , which forbid the use , production and stockpiling of chemical weapons			1
and both countries missed the convention 's extended deadline last year to destroy all of their chemical weapons			1
this fact was highlighted during friday 's ceremony awarding the 2013 @entity27 to the @entity28 , which is helping to eliminate the @entity3 army 's stockpiles of poison gas			2
" certain states have not observed the deadline , which was april 2012 , for destroying their chemical weapons , " the @entity34 committee noted in its official announcement of the coveted peace prize			1
" this applies especially to the @entity7 and @entity14			2
" the @entity7 estimates it will be at least another decade before it completes destruction of the remaining 10 % of its chemical weapons , estimated at more than 3,100 tons			1
@entity14 has more than five times that amount left to destroy , according to the @entity28			0
while it 's unclear exactly how many chemical weapons @entity3 has , @entity7 intelligence and other estimates put its chemical weapons stockpile at about 1,000 tons stored in dozens of sites			1
@entity3 's chemical arsenal at a glance the @entity52 has given @entity3 until mid- 2014 to destroy that arsenal and @entity52 weapons inspectors have expressed optimism that this deadline can be reached , despite having to dart in and out of battle zones amid @entity3 's bloody civil war			1
@entity59 , who once worked on the @entity7 project to destroy its chemical stockpile , is n't so sure that @entity3 can meet that deadline			1
he said the @entity7 effort took billions of dollars , the cooperation of many levels of government -- including the military -- and a safe environment to make sure the destruction was done safely			2
" we had a coordinated effort , we had a government that insisted that it be done safely and that the community was protected , " said @entity59 , who now works with the @entity71 emergency management team , which makes sure the @entity1 community is aware of the project			0
" i do n't think those things are in place in @entity3			2
" @entity59 briefly worked at the @entity79 in @entity71 , a desert town bracketed by mountains outside of @entity81 where 43 % of the nation 's chemical weapons were once stored			1
the rest was stored at eight other sites around the country			0
the weapons were first warehoused at the @entity71 facility in 1942 , during @entity89 , and grew over time			0
at one point , the @entity7 once housed the majority of its chemical arsenal -- 13,000 tons -- and a million munitions at the facility			2
@entity0 was chosen because military leaders figured @entity96 warplanes could hit the @entity97 but not fly over the mountains to @entity1 without refueling , said @entity100 , who spent 40 years working at the facility			0
" there was mustard gas originally ... a lot of smoke - type bombs , smoke pods , " @entity100 recalled			0
then , in the 1950s , a lot of nerve gas was transported to the facility , he said			0
eventually , the @entity7 signed the international chemical treaty in the 1990s and got serious about getting rid of the chemicals in a way that would not harm the environment or the people working at the plant or living in the area			1
while the process was slow and expensive , @entity100 said there was not a single casualty despite the volatility of some of the chemicals			0
" you know the whole task is nothing short of miraculous in my mind , " @entity100 said			0
" and i was part of it			0
" today there are no weapons at the @entity71 facility			0
the process of safely getting rid of these chemicals and munitions took 16 years , and was finally completed last year			2
workers there will soon begin the process of dismantling the plants needed to do the job			0
yet , there are still more than 3,000 tons of chemical weapons left in the @entity7 , stored at two remaining facilities at @entity141 , @entity142 , and @entity143 , @entity144			1
the majority is in @entity141 , where officials plan to start in 2015 destroying 2,600 tons of mustard blister chemicals stored in projectiles in liquid form			0
the process is expected to take four years			0
at the @entity143 plant outside @entity153 , @entity144 , there are 523 tons of mustard agent , vx and sarin nerve agents			0
officials predict the job of destroying that arsenal , which is slated to start in 2020 , will be completed in 2023			0
the world 's attention turned to @entity3 's chemical weapons stockpile after the @entity7 and other countries accused @entity3 of using chemical weapons in an august 21 attack outside @entity166 , a strike @entity15 says killed more than 1,400 people -- including many women and children			1
@entity3 denies the accusation and says its own troops have faced poison gas attacks by rebel forces in the civil war that began in 2011			2
last month , the @entity176 later voted unanimously to require @entity3 to eliminate its arsenal of chemical weapons or face consequences			1
the @entity52 team in @entity3 overseeing the destruction of @entity3 's chemical weapons says the @entity184 regime is cooperating			1
securing @entity3 's chemical weapons wo n't be easy it 's unclear how these weapons can be found , secured , and safely destroyed by next year in the middle of a protracted conflict , considering that it is expected to take the @entity7 three years to destroy half of the chemical weapons that @entity3 is estimated to have -- and that 's in a remote part of @entity144 with no civil war			1
asked about that , the @entity7 @entity194 told @entity2 in a written statement that it 's " inaccurate to draw parallels between the @entity7 chemical demilitarization program and the international cooperation that will be required to destroy the chemical stockpile in @entity3			1
" @entity202 general says @entity3 will never give up chemical weapons @entity2 's @entity204 contributed to this report			1
watch @entity206 with @entity207 weekdays at 4pm to 6pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity208 .			0
