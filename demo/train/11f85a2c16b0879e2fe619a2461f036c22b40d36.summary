-- in many ways , @entity1 is the archetypal young professional women 's golfer , desperate to make a breakthrough on one of the major tours in @entity7 or the @entity8			1
educated at an @entity8 university , the 22 - year - old speaks four languages			1
her @entity13 page lists has hundreds of friends from all over the world			0
a stylist on the course , she sports an elegant line in clothing -- more often than not wearing a polo shirt and pink skirt			0
but , unlike her peers , @entity1 is a trailblazer in a region of the world that has seen turmoil and political upheaval over the past year , and where women 's freedoms are often severely restricted			1
hailing from @entity30 , she 's the first @entity31 woman to compete in a professional golf tournament			1
her lifetime ambition is to follow in the footsteps of the @entity37 nation 's legendary middle - distance track and field athletes and win @entity39 gold			1
@entity40 will return to the four - yearly sporting showpiece in @entity42 in 2016 after an absence of more than a century			0
" i have always watched the @entity39 with my father and it is the biggest sports event worldwide , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" we have had some great @entity30 athletes like @entity48 that have made the country proud , and my dream is to follow in their footsteps			1
" fortunately for @entity1 , she was brought up by a liberal family who did not insist on traditional dress code for their young daughter			2
able to practice on local courses near their home in @entity59 , she quickly showed an aptitude for golf and received support from the country 's ministry of sport			2
she has spent four years on the collegiate golf circuit in the @entity8 , studying at @entity67 in @entity68 and earning the accolade of top - ranked @entity70 women 's golfer during that time			1
when she graduated , the repercussions of the @entity73 began to be felt in the wider region , and in @entity30 there were also demands for democratic change			2
the bulk of the country has been ruled by a monarchist dynasty since the 17th century , with @entity81 holding power since 1999			0
with regimes in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 swept away , @entity30 's 48 - year - old ruler promised reforms			1
in november 's election he was obliged to choose the prime minister from the largest party , rather than by his own personal choice			0
he had , in 2004 , introduced measures which addressed women 's rights			0
" i am a big supporter for freedom and peaceful change , " @entity1 said			2
" we had a couple of peaceful protests in @entity30 which have led to major changes in the constitution of the country , but we have enjoyed our freedoms in @entity30 for decades			1
" @entity1 is proud of her country and wants to represent it with distinction			2
" my aim is to be the first @entity30 and @entity31 golfer to make it into the @entity109 , " she said			1
" i hope that there will be a lot more women that will follow in my footsteps			0
" success has already come with gold in women 's golf at last year 's @entity118 in @entity119 in a team which included her younger sister @entity121			2
last season , her first as a professional , @entity1 finished 25th in the @entity124 held in her hometown , and made the halfway cut at another @entity127 ' @entity109 ( @entity128 ) event in @entity130			1
but it is a big step from collegiate golf to the cut - throat professional world , and this year she will again rely on invites to main tour events			1
a disastrous second - round 84 at the let qualifying school in @entity138 in @entity139 wrecked her chances of winning a card with full playing rights			0
" i do n't know what happened there , it was a tough week , " she admitted			0
but @entity1 is undeterred and will be looking to her home tournament in march on the @entity148 course in @entity59 to make a big impression			2
with a men 's @entity109 event , the @entity150 , and the @entity124 held in the same week at the end of next month , plus a host of regional tournaments , @entity30 is promoting itself as a golf destination par excellence			1
outside investment , mainly from the @entity158 , has brought several new courses and developments -- as @entity1 says , " taking advantage of our fantastic weather and the opportunity to share a very rich culture			2
" @entity1 aside , @entity30 players either male or female have yet to make a much of an impression among the professional elite , but all that could be changing			1
" @entity40 is becoming more affordable for locals thanks to the work of the @entity174 , " she said			0
with more youngsters playing , the talent is starting to emerge			0
@entity177 , 18 , has earned an invite to this week 's @entity179 , where he will rub shoulders with some of the best players in the world			0
@entity1 will target december 's @entity184 ' masters on the let as she tries to earn enough money to get an automatic card for 2013			0
though proud of her roots and background , it was her spell in the @entity8 that decided on her career path			0
" getting an education in the @entity8 is definitely the best choice i have made in my life , " she said			0
" it allowed me to play golf and pursue my education at the same time			1
it has prepared me for my current life as a professional golfer where i have to travel on my own			0

@entity1 is first @entity31 woman to play golf in a major professional event
@entity1 wants to win @entity39 gold and tournaments in @entity7 and the @entity8
the 22 - year - old from @entity30 is supported by her national *federation*
