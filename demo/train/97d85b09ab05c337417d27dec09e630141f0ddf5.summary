@entity0 -- retired justice @entity2 had harsh words for his former conservative colleagues wednesday , saying they have inconsistently applied the law two years after a sweeping ruling dealing with campaign finance reform			1
that controversial decision , known as @entity9 , gave corporations -- individuals , unions , businesses and advocacy groups -- greater power to spend unlimited amounts of money to support or oppose federal election candidates			1
@entity2 issued a bitter dissent in that case , months before stepping down from the high court after 35 years on the bench			2
he said @entity23 had long imposed reasonable limits on corporate spending as a way to curb the potentially corrupting influence by the wealthy , whose voices would be heard above those of others in the crowded political landscape			0
@entity2 , at an evening speech at the @entity34 , said the five conservatives who gave corporations greater power in the name of free speech may now be rethinking , even regretting , their decision , based on related cases since that 2010 decision			1
in particular , he noted the @entity9 decision , which struck down the @entity44 campaign finance reform law , said the @entity49 " generally prohibits the suppression of political speech based on the speaker 's identity			1
" the 92 - year - old former justice said the court will soon have to confront the question of whether the ruling applies to the ability of foreign corporations , potentially even terror groups , to spend freely			1
he predicted the justices would decide it does not			0
" the court must then explain its abandonment of , or at least qualify reliance upon , the proposition that the identity of the speaker is an impermissible basis for regulating campaign speech , " he told the audience			0
" it will be necessary to explain why the @entity49 provides greater protection for some nonvoters than that of other nonvoters			0
he said @entity73 corporations , unlike individuals , were in that broad category of nonvoters			0
@entity2 predicted creating an exception for the foreign corporations " will create a crack in the foundation of the @entity9 majority " led by the conservatives under chief justice @entity83			1
president @entity85 , just days after the @entity9 opinion , said in his @entity86 address that it would " open the floodgates for special interests , including foreign corporations , to spend without limits in our elections			1
" justice @entity94 , named to the court by president @entity96 in 2006 , was in the audience at the time and famously mouthed the words " not true " to @entity85 's remarks			0
but @entity2 said that while he has not talked with @entity94 about it , the mouthed words indicated " there will not be five votes " to sustain a majority if and when the court confronts the foreign spending question			1
@entity2 also noted time and logic has borne out the president 's warnings			2
the high court earlier this year upheld a lower court ruling preventing noncitizens from contributing to federal political candidates			0
that , said @entity2 , showed the justices clearly believe " the identity of some speakers may provide a legally acceptable basis for restricting speech " in election contributions			1
" i think it likely when the court begins to spell out which categories of nonvoters should receive the same protections " enjoyed by @entity73 corporations , " it will not only exclude terrorist organizations and foreign agents , but also all corporations owned or controlled by noncitizens , and possibly even those in which noncitizens have a substantial ownership interest			0
" @entity2 ' pointed remarks come in the midst of a presidential campaign season that is already breaking records for spending by outside groups , many of them so - called super pacs now unencumbered by previous spending limits			2
the justice on tuesday received the @entity144 from @entity85 in a @entity146 ceremony			0
the president praised @entity2 for his independent , rigorous approach to the law , " favoring a pragmatic solution over an ideological one			2
" critics of @entity2 said he had abandoned his earlier conservative leanings to become a liberal on the high court			2
in his retirement , @entity2 has been outspoken about his former colleagues , criticizing rulings issued before and after he left the court .			0
