@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former @entity0 police lieutenant pleaded guilty wednesday to obstruction of justice in connection with the police shootings of civilians in the days after @entity9 and court documents unsealed with the plea suggest that other officers will be indicted in the case			1
former lt. @entity17 was convicted of " conspiring with a group of @entity0 police officers to obstruct justice by engaging in a cover - up of the true circumstances surrounding the shooting , by @entity25 officers , of a number of individuals , " @entity15 attorney @entity14 of the @entity16 of @entity1 said at a news conference			2
two civilians were killed and four were wounded in the shootings on the @entity32 on september 4 , 2005 , days after @entity9 roared ashore on the @entity33			1
read the criminal complaint the guilty plea does not signal the end of the investigation into the incident , @entity14 said			0
" know this : the investigation continues , " he said , adding that " this investigation is being conducted very aggressively , but also very fairly			0
" the federal indictment unsealed wednesday signaled that other indictments are likely			1
" [ @entity43 ] he incident involved at least seven @entity25 officers who drove to the @entity32 in a rental truck in response to a call for police assistance , " the indictment said			2
@entity2 @entity0 affiliate @entity50 reported that two other officers have received target letters from federal prosecutors			1
such letters are sent to targets of grand jury investigations			0
legal scholars said they expected more indictments in the cover - up of the shooting but that it 's unclear whether any officers will be charged for the shooting itself			2
" there 's no evidence the officers shot out of malice , " said @entity65 , a professor at @entity67 ' @entity66			0
" it was probably negligence , ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover - up			0
" @entity17 , the officer who pleaded guilty wednesday , conspired with other police officers to cover up the shootings even though he believed them to be " legally unjustified , " according to the federal indictment			1
among @entity17 's actions , he fabricated stories , statements , a 17 - page report and a follow - up report , and lied to federal agents , @entity14 said			0
the shootings occurred after several officers , responding to a call for assistance , drove to the bridge and encountered six civilians who were walking across it to get food and supplies , the indictment says			2
the officers fired , killing one person -- later identified as 19 - year - old @entity95 -- and wounding four others , according to the indictment			0
witness in 2006 : @entity0 cops shot man in back once they reached the other side of the bridge , the officers started shooting again , killing @entity106 , a 40 - year - old severely disabled man , the indictment says			2
@entity106 was shot seven times -- five times in the back , the coroner has said			0
@entity17 arrived on the scene after the shooting , learned that his police colleagues " planned to provide false stories about what had precipitated the shooting " and " encouraged them to do so , " according to the indictment			0
among other things , @entity17 did not ensure police collected evidence , suggested that colleagues get rid of some shell casings the shooters had left behind and went along with a plan to plant a gun near the bridge , according to the indictment			0
the officers falsely arrested @entity106 's brother on eight counts of attempted murder of a police officer , according to the indictment			1
@entity135 was held for weeks before being released without any formal charges filed against him			0
state prosecutors pursued criminal charges against several police officers without success			1
in august 2008 , a judge quashed indictments against @entity144			0
@entity145 and @entity146 , officer @entity146 and former officer @entity147 , all of whom were facing first - degree murder and attempted murder charges			1
in addition , he threw out attempted first - degree murder charges against officers @entity154 and @entity156 , and attempted second - degree murder charges against officer @entity158			1
federal prosecutors opened an investigation after the judge 's actions			1
the failure of the state prosecutors ' strategy is another reason legal scholars say they expect the federal indictments to hinge on the cover - up instead of the shooting itself .			1

new : two other officers have received target letters from federal prosecutors
