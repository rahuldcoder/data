celebrity chef @entity0 , who lost endorsements and a national cooking show after she admitted using a racial slur in the past , on friday welcomed the resolution of a lawsuit by a former employee who leveled accusations of racism and sexual harassment			1
the federal lawsuit will be dismissed by agreement , according to a court filing			1
it was not immediately clear whether there was a settlement , but a description on a federal court website labeled the filing as a " settlement agreement			1
" a federal judge in @entity21 had not signed off on the agreement , according to the filing			1
the proceedings will be dismissed " with prejudice , " meaning the lawsuit can not be filed again			1
the parties agreed the dismissal would be " without any award of costs or fees to any party , " according to the posting			1
earlier this month , @entity35 district judge @entity34 in @entity36 dismissed a portion of the lawsuit that contended former employee @entity39 was a victim of racial discrimination			1
@entity41 released a statement friday , said she believes " in kindness and fairness for everyone			2
" " while this has been a difficult time for both my family and myself , i am pleased that the judge dismissed the race claims and i am looking forward to getting this behind me , now that the remaining claims have been resolved			2
" @entity41 's career and public reputation went into a tailspin earlier this summer after her deposition in the lawsuit , in which she admitted using the " @entity60 " in the past , was released			1
@entity61 alleged that @entity41 and her brother , @entity62 , committed numerous acts of violence , discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five years of employment at @entity71 , and @entity73 's @entity72 -- two @entity36 , @entity21 , restaurants run by @entity41 and her family			1
but @entity61 could not claim to be a victim of racial discrimination targeting @entity80 workers because she is white , @entity34 ruled in early august			2
other aspects of the lawsuit , including sexual harassment and abusive treatment , were still pending until friday 's agreed order of dismissal			1
@entity87 was unable to immediately reach lawyers for @entity61			2
@entity36 is where @entity41 built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of @entity96 cooking			2
in the media firestorm that followed news of the deposition , @entity41 lost lucrative endorsements and her @entity102 cooking show , while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled			0
in her statement , @entity41 thanked @entity61 for five years of service at @entity73 's			1
" moving forward my team and i are working to review the workplace environment issues that were raised in this matter and to retool all of my businesses operations , " @entity41 said			0
" i look forward to getting back to doing what i love			0
" @entity61 's complaint alleged that a " racially biased attitude prevailed throughout and pervaded defendants ' restaurant operations , " and that @entity80 staff could use the restaurant 's rear entrance only			1
but the judge ruled there was no evidence racially offensive comments allegedly made by @entity126 were directed toward @entity61 or made with the intent to harass her			0
the complaint said the company was a " boy 's club " with men in management positions , " and women are not invited to take on substantial decision - making roles			1
" @entity61 contended that @entity62 subjected her to sexual harassment on " an almost daily basis			0
" in june , @entity41 's sons staunchly defended their mother , saying allegations of racism were false " character assassination			1
" " neither one of our parents ever taught us to be bigoted toward any other person for any reason , " @entity41 told @entity87 's " @entity151 " in an exclusive interview with @entity145			1
" our mother is one of the most compassionate , good - hearted , empathetic people that you 'd ever meet , " he added			0
" these accusations are very hurtful to her , and it 's very sad			2
" a deposition confession at a may deposition in the @entity61 lawsuit , @entity41 admitted having used the " @entity60 " long ago			2
@entity61 lawyer : " @entity165 , have you told racial jokes ? " @entity41 : " no , not racial			0
" @entity61 lawyer : " have you ever used the ' @entity60 ' yourself ? " @entity41 : " yes , of course			0
" @entity41 testified that she probably used the racial slur when talking to her husband about " when a black man burst into the bank that i was working at and put a gun to my head			0
" " i did n't feel real favorable towards him , " she said , referring to the robber			0
@entity61 lawyer : " have you used it since then ? " @entity41 : " i 'm sure i have , but it 's been a very long time			2
" @entity41 said she could n't remember other contexts in which she used the slur , but " maybe in repeating something that was said to me			0
" " but that 's just not a word that we use as time has gone on , " she said			2
" things have changed since the ' 60s in the @entity96			0
and my children and my brother object to that word being used in any cruel or mean behavior			0
" @entity41 apologized for her language in two videos produced in june			0
" i want to learn and grow from this , " she said in one video			0
" inappropriate and hurtful language is totally , totally unacceptable			0
i 've made plenty of mistakes along the way but i beg you , my children , my team , my fans , my partners -- i beg for your forgiveness			0
