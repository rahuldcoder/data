-- in 1984 , in the midst of @entity4 's civil war , @entity1 started hosting regular gatherings at his @entity7 beachfront apartment for the purpose of " musical therapy			1
" weary and traumatized from the conflict that had divided their city -- and would claim some 150,000 lives over its 15 years -- people would come to his apartment to lose themselves in a night of jazz , blues , funk , soul , classical and @entity22 music			1
" they used to come because of the music , to forget the war , " said @entity1			2
" we used to do this for peace			0
" the party nights were an important outlet , he said , as during the war years there were few other options			1
" my friends had nowhere to go , " he said			0
there were two or three clubs in @entity37 east @entity7 , the same in the city 's @entity39 west			1
" but they were very constipated			0
very good dress , the same music all the time , " he said			0
" it was very commercial , easy listening , everywhere you go			0
" @entity7 has come a long way since then			1
after dark , the city comes alive : a balmy playground of chic nightclubs , rough and ready dives , stylish rooftop bars			2
the hip , hedonistic scenes in the fashionable neighborhoods of @entity55 or @entity56 are unlike anything to be found elsewhere in the @entity60 world -- and can be an unexpected find in a country in which austere @entity64 militant group @entity63 forms part of the government			2
" it is the nightlife capital of the region , " said @entity67 , managing director of city guide @entity68			1
" it 's cosmopolitan and has this @entity74 - meets - @entity75 feel			1
i do n't think there 's anything on par. " a fixture of the @entity7 scene is @entity1 's nightclub , @entity83			1
opened in 1994 , and named for the lock - code on the door of his old apartment , the club has helped to usher in a more cosmopolitan , vibrant nightlife in the aftermath of the war , he said			1
" when i opened the club , artists start to go out , lesbians and gays started to go out , " he said			0
@entity7 's vibrancy is partly an expression of a @entity4 lust for life , a determination to seize the day after having endured years of war and associated traumas , said @entity102			1
" with all the issues you 've had here , people just want to enjoy life			0
it tends to be : let 's just live it up today			2
we can worry about the rest tomorrow			0
" but it also reflects a cosmopolitan tradition that has long been part of the character of this diverse @entity117 port city , a thriving trading center for thousands of years and a place where 18 officially recognized religious sects live -- most of the time -- in a state of respectful coexistence			1
this cultural capital is one of his country 's greatest national assets , said @entity1			2
" the people are more liberal , more free , they love life			2
we say this is our petrol , it 's our oil			2
" while liquor vendors in some other parts of @entity4 have been targeted with protests and even violence in recent times , @entity7 has a liberal , tolerant attitude towards drinking			1
" the tolerance for drinking is very similar to @entity141 , so you do n't have the same issues you do in other countries in the region , " said @entity102			2
@entity7 's nightlife was centered in areas where local communities had no issues with alcohol , she said : " i have seen no evidence of any clashes with any religious groups about the nightlife in @entity7			1
" one distinctive aspect of the city 's nightlife was that it was not unusual to see a wide age range of people out enjoying themselves -- even multiple generations of a family			1
" in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s , @entity7 was considered the place to come and party , but when the war happened that got all cut off			1
a whole generation could n't go out and enjoy themselves , " said @entity102			0
" so when the war ended a generation wanted to see their kids go out and enjoy themselves , and the parents themselves want to recapture what they lost from their youth			0
" i 've seen tables where it 's all the parents at one and all the kids on another table			0
" at @entity83 , the connections and disjunctions between @entity7 's war - torn past and hedonistic present are referenced in the very architecture			1
it looks like a bomb shelter			0
situated near @entity7 's port in a district known as @entity194 , the site was once a slum home to thousands of @entity198 and @entity199 refugees			1
on january 18 , 1976 , a massacre by local militias killed hundreds and left the area abandoned			0
the club was designed by @entity1 's cousin , the architect @entity205			0
its striking underground design is , in @entity205 's words , " a reaction to difficult and explosive conditions that are inherent to the history of its location -- and the contradictions that are implied by the implementation of an entertainment program on such a site			0
" a subterranean club might not seem to make much sense in a city where rooftop bars are the most popular option , but the club 's roof opens to make the most of balmy evenings -- or mornings , for the truly dedicated			1
it is at that point , said @entity102 , the genuine bon vivants are likely to continue partying , heading to beach clubs to the city 's north and south for a swim and another drink on a sun lounger			2
@entity237 are known for making good use of the attractive natural surroundings beyond the city limits ; in july and august 2006 , the city 's social set decamped to the mountains to avoid the hostilities with @entity245			1
this time , war did n't stop them			0
" a lot of people packed up and went up to the mountains , " said @entity102			0
" people were loading their shopping trolleys with cigarettes and whiskey ... the party moved up there			0
" @entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0

@entity7 's vibrant , cosmopolitan nightlife is *renowned* throughout the region
after 15 years of civil war , @entity237 have a " seize the day " attitude , say locals
it also reflects the liberal , tolerant outlook often found in this diverse port city
