@entity0 , @entity1 -- welcome to @entity0			1
it may have been the last flight into @entity1			1
@entity4 from @entity5 , @entity6			1
throughout the flight i watched as the passenger in the seat behind me , an older @entity1 gentleman , got steadily more intoxicated on his bottle of @entity12			1
toward the end of the three - hour flight , he was asking fellow passengers in a loud voice if they wanted to join him in establishing a new party to promote democracy in @entity1			1
when we took off from @entity5 , @entity20 @entity19 was still president of @entity1 , and had ruled the nation since 1987			1
when we landed , cell phones started going off , my @entity24 was buzzing like an angry hornet			1
further coverage on @entity27 the stewardess informed us over the plane intercom that because of the general strike , we would not be able to retrieve our luggage , and because of the curfew we would not be able to leave the airport			1
this did n't seem to faze most of the passengers , who were busy discussing @entity19 's departure			1
" i 'm glad he 's gone , " a businessman told me with a smile of quiet satisfaction			1
" things will be better now			1
" for the @entity2 crew , it seemed like our problems were just beginning			1
what can you do sitting in an airport ? how do you cover the story from a plastic chair in the arrival hall ? @entity55 @entity54 of @entity56 , @entity57 , and i pondered our options , and they were n't good			1
there 's only so much " atmosphere " you can get at an airport			1
a crew from @entity1 tv was videotaping soldiers next to the arrival hall			1
a large army truck pulled up , disgorging more soldiers			1
our prospects were looking worse by the minute , until a large man approached me and asked if i needed a taxi			1
" a taxi ? " i asked , taken aback			1
" but there 's a curfew , there are checkpoints and i can hear gunfire			1
how can you take us to the city ? " " everything is fine , " he responded			1
" i 'll take you			1
" after some bargaining we settled on € 40 , a stiff surcharge , but i agreed			1
better € 40 than a night sleeping on a cold and gritty airport floor			1
we put our hand luggage in the boot , got in and started to leave the airport			1
" the road is closed , " someone shouted to us			2
i told @entity54 we had probably a less than 50 % chance of making it to the hotel			2
the driver seemed to think i was optimistic			2
" you realize i 'm gambling my life to do this , " he told me			2
but then added quickly " everything will be fine			2
" so fine , in fact , all the while he was smoking one cigarette after another , taking phone calls from relatives , some as far away as @entity102 , asking how he was			2
the highway from the airport was utterly deserted			2
not a car , not a person			2
all the stores were closed			2
after about 10 minutes we arrived in the city proper , where we encountered our first checkpoint , a tank and an armored personnel carrier			2
we stopped , the driver told them we were going to the hotel			2
they responded that the main road was closed ; we would have to take a detour			2
a few minutes later , another checkpoint			2
more soldiers , who ordered the driver out			0
they checked his papers , looked in the car , saw we were foreigners and let us proceed			0
a minute later , another checkpoint			0
the soldiers made us all get out			0
i showed them my passport , explained i had made the mistake of choosing @entity1 as a vacation destination			1
they did n't think that was funny			0
nearby there were two young men on their knees , hands tied behind their backs			0
unlike the previous checkpoints , this one was tense			0
the soldiers did n't like our presence , but eventually waved us on			0
the streets were strewn with trash , in some areas broken glass			0
it was by no means a scene of destruction , but it was clear that earlier in the day thousands of people had been there			0
the closer we got to the center of the city , the more soldiers we saw , as well as plain - clothes policemen carrying revolvers or automatic weapons			0
where there were groups of soldiers , there were more young men on their knees with their hands bound			0
i looked down one street and saw three young men peering anxiously around a corner			0
although it was quiet , something was afoot			0
" @entity177 ! " a soldier shouted at us as we drove by			0
" go home ! " " we 're almost at the hotel			0
pay me now , " the driver said			0
" but where is the hotel ? " i asked			0
" " there it is , " he said , pointing to a large white siding in front of a building			0
" now hurry up and pay me			0
i need to get out of here and go home			0
" the main door was covered			0
a man stuck his head out from behind the siding and looked at us quizzically			0
" is this the hotel ? " i asked him			0
" yes , yes , " he responded , motioning urgently			0
" my " less than 50 % chance of success " prediction was wrong			0
