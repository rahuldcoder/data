@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 left jail friday , free on bond eight days after the shooting death of his model girlfriend , @entity7			1
magistrate @entity8 said the state had problems with its investigation and had not offered enough proof to keep @entity3 jailed			1
" i come to the conclusion that the accused has made a case to be released on bail , " @entity8 said , eliciting a celebratory cry of " yes ! " from the courtroom			2
" we are relieved , " said @entity3 ' uncle , @entity18 , speaking on behalf of the family			1
@entity3 , who wept throughout much of friday 's hearing , remained quiet and reserved after the announcement and did not appear to celebrate			1
" as a family , we know @entity3 's version of what happened that tragic night			1
and we know that that is the truth and that will prevail in the coming court cases , " his uncle said			2
@entity3 is accused of premeditated murder in the february 14 shooting death of @entity7 , 29			1
prosecutors say @entity3 , 26 , killed her after a heated argument in the early morning hours of @entity36			1
the sprinter says he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his @entity0 home			0
he says he fired in a fit of terror before realizing @entity7 was inside			1
" i 'd like to ask @entity3 why he did n't lean over and touch my cousin first ... and say ' are you okay ? ' ' keep quiet , ' ' i 'm coming now , ' " said @entity44 , @entity7 's cousin			1
in full : @entity3 ' affidavit to court while recounting a litany of " improbabilities " in @entity3 ' account , @entity8 said defense attorneys had done enough to prove the " exceptional circumstances " required by @entity1 law for the release of a suspect charged with premeditated murder			1
he said the former chief investigator in the case , @entity59 , had made " several errors and concessions " in his testimony at the bail hearing , and said prosecutors had failed to prove that @entity3 was a flight risk or had a propensity toward violence			1
@entity59 was replaced after prosecutors reinstated attempted murder charges against him in a 2011 incident unrelated to @entity3			1
key arguments during the four - day bail hearing , prosecutors argued that @entity3 had a history of violence and that his account did n't add up			1
prosecutors relied heavily on @entity59 's testimony , including statements from witnesses , who said they heard @entity3 and @entity7 arguing before the shooting , as well as ballistic evidence that @entity59 said proved @entity3 was lying about how he had shot into the door			1
but @entity59 seemed to buckle under questioning from defense attorney @entity86 , who got the detective to acknowledge that the bullet evidence was n't as conclusive as he had initially said and that at least one witness he had spoken to could not say for certain that the sounds he had heard came from @entity3 ' house			1
@entity8 also said that @entity59 had failed to exhaustively check cell phone records and chided the investigator for failing to check with @entity94 before testifying that @entity3 owned a home in @entity96 -- raising his profile as a potential flight risk			1
the source of the information about the house apparently was a magazine article , the judge noted			0
@entity86 also said that defense investigators had found a bullet missed by police and that police may have contaminated the crime scene by failing to wear protective shoe covers			0
police had run out of the covers , @entity59 testified			0
@entity8 said he was n't convinced by prosecution arguments that @entity3 had a violent nature and was a threat to the public			1
the prosecution cited an incident in which @entity3 reportedly fired a gun on accident inside a @entity121 restaurant and another in which he allegedly made violent threats			1
finally , @entity8 said @entity59 had " blundered " in testifying that a substance recovered from @entity3 ' home was testosterone			2
some outsiders to the case have speculated that steroids or other substances could have played a role in the killing			2
the defense lawyer told @entity8 the substance was a legal herbal remedy			0
tests are ongoing , authorities said			0
too soon to judge on the other hand , @entity8 said @entity3 ' account is full of " improbabilities , " from why he did not know @entity7 had gotten out of bed to why he would have charged toward the bathroom door -- where he believed he had an intruder cornered -- if he was as scared for his life as he claimed			1
@entity8 warned that it is too soon to judge the state 's case , and he noted that a wide range of experts beyond @entity59 had worked on the initial phases of the investigation -- from ballistics experts to specialists in blood spatter			0
" the pieces of the puzzle may not yet all be before me , " he said			0
conditions of bail @entity3 left jail in a @entity158 chased by paparazzi on motorcycles friday afternoon after posting a cash bond of 100,000 @entity162 ( about $ 11,200 )			1
another 900,000 @entity162 ( about $ 100,800 ) is due by march 1 , @entity8 said			0
he headed to his uncle 's home after his release			2
he can not return to the home where the shooting happened , has to give up his passport and ca n't go near an airport , @entity8 ruled			0
he also ca n't drink alcohol and must report to authorities four times a month			0

@entity59 , a 22 - year detective , is accused of seven counts of attempted murder after allegedly chasing and firing on a minibus full of people while drunk , according to officials			0
a spokeswoman for @entity1 's prosecution service said the accusations would be little more than a " speed bump " in the case			0
friend reacts model @entity191 , a @entity1 model who is friends with @entity3 , said the murder charge does n't fit with the kind - spirited man she knows			1
and she said she can relate to @entity3 ' story of being filled with terror at the thought of an intruder			2
" it 's not the safest place in the world , " she said of crime - ridden @entity1 , where murder and carjacking cases are common			0
" my own home is like a prison			0
his version of events is n't as far - fetched as people think it is			0
" ' @entity3 ' @entity3 earned the nickname " @entity3 " as he competed on special carbon fiber blades in place of more traditional prosthetic limbs			2
he was born missing bones in his lower legs , and doctors amputated his legs below the knees when he was 11 months old			0
