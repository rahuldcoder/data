-- a @entity2 plant linked to an outbreak of illness has been shut temporarily , and the company said monday that it expects to lay off more than 200 workers as a result			1
preliminary results " indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , " the @entity8 says			2
" it 's likely that we 're going to have some temporary layoffs at that facility , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity12 said of the @entity14 , @entity15 , facility that was churning out refrigerated cookie - dough products until thursday			1
about 550 people work at the factory , but only about half of them work on cookie dough , she said			1
the rest work on @entity26 pasta and sauce in a separate facility at the plant			1
she said there is little chance that the @entity26 products might be tainted , because -- even if the cookie dough is proved to be the source of the outbreak of @entity35 -- it is a kosher product , meaning it is made from a segregated stream of ingredients			1
@entity14 's @entity38 said the city 's unemployment rate is 14.3 percent			0
@entity2 was first alerted to the problem late wednesday by the @entity8 and the @entity42 , @entity12 said , adding : " less than a day later , we made the decision to remove the product			2
" included in the recall are 300,000 cases of the product			1
each case contains 12 packages , and each package contains 24 cookies			0
that 's a total of 86.4 million cookies ' worth of dough			0
the recall does not include @entity57 's or @entity59 's ice cream products with @entity61 " cookie dough " ingredients			1
that 's because the " dough " in ice cream is not really dough at all ; it is cooked			0
" ice cream is a different formulation , " @entity12 said			0
" since it 's not meant to be baked before consumption -- those cookie crumbles that are in the formulation -- they 're all cooked			0
for the cookie dough that 's present in the ice cream , @entity57 's is using heat - treated ingredients			2
" according to the @entity8 , between march 1 and monday , 70 people in 30 states had been infected with a strain of @entity35			1
the ages of the people affected ranged from 2 to 57 years , though more than 70 percent were younger than 19 , and 75 percent were female , the agency said on its web site			2
twenty - five people had been hospitalized , and seven had developed a kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome			0
no fatalities had been reported , it said			0
" preliminary results of this investigation indicate a strong association with eating raw prepackaged cookie dough , " the agency said			2
" most patients reported eating refrigerated prepackaged @entity61 cookie dough products raw			1
" though cooking the product would kill the bacteria , the agency did not recommend that people holding on to the company 's cookie - dough products do so , " because consumers might get the bacteria on their hands and on other cooking surfaces			1
" the recall does not include @entity61 morsels , which are used as an ingredient in many homemade baked goods , or other baked cookie products			0
