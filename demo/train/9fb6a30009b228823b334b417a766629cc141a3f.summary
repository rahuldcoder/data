-- a little over two days			0
that 's how long the grand jury deliberated before deciding not to bring an indictment against @entity5 , the police officer who shot and killed @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 on august 9			1
@entity10 prosecutor @entity9 announced the grand jury had heard more than 70 hours of testimony from 60 witnesses before reaching its decision , which he said was supported by physical evidence			1
sadly , the grand jury 's failure to return an indictment of @entity5 was not surprising			1
but do n't blame the grand jury ; blame @entity9			1
he oversaw the proceedings and bears responsibility for their outcome			0
@entity9 compromised the @entity7 grand jury proceedings from the start			1
he resisted calls to recuse himself , saying , " i have absolutely no intention of walking away from duties and the responsibilities entrusted in me by the people of this community			0
" however , the community would have been better served if he had stepped aside			0
are protests taking place near you ? @entity9 's father was a police officer killed in a shootout with an @entity37 suspect			2
his brother , uncle and cousin served with the @entity41 , and his mother worked there for 20 years as a clerk			0
@entity45 noted @entity9 's " long history of siding with the police			2
" for the sake of impartiality , @entity9 should have let a special prosecutor take over the case			2
the grand jury only needed to find " probable cause " to charge @entity5			1
that 's one of the lowest legal standards in our justice system , below " beyond a reasonable doubt " ( required for a criminal conviction ) and " preponderance of the evidence " ( the standard in a civil trial )			0
the fact that @entity9 did not get an indictment for a killing that shocked the nation raises questions about whether he really wanted an indictment			2
" we will be presenting absolutely everything to this grand jury , " @entity9 said in august			1
yet in grand jury proceedings , the prosecutor typically shows the minimal amount of evidence necessary to establish that a trial is merited			1
by dumping so much evidence on the grand jury , @entity9 may have overwhelmed them and led them to the wrong conclusion			1
in the process , he 's opened himself to charges that he was acting to protect @entity5			1
opinion : why i feel torn about the @entity7 verdict consider @entity9 's time frame for the grand jury , which the @entity90 described as " prolonged and exhaustive			1
" grand juries routinely return criminal indictments in a matter of days			0
but the @entity7 proceedings dragged on for months , putting a burden on the jurors to recall everything and then decide wisely			0
another red flag was that this lengthy process was riddled with leaks , all of which supported @entity5 's account of the events			0
worse , @entity9 declined to recommend charges to the grand jury			1
prosecutors normally walk a jury through the charges they are seeking , breaking them down and explaining why they are deserved			0
@entity9 instead left the @entity7 grand jury to sort through terms such as " voluntary manslaughter " and " involuntary manslaughter in the second degree " on their own -- making it more likely that they would not seek an indictment			1
in fact , @entity9 could have brought charges directly against @entity5 , circumventing the grand jury			1
he chose not to do so , which is a troubling indicator of his interest in aggressively prosecuting this case			0
opinion : @entity7 shows failure at every level sure , there are conflicting accounts of what transpired between @entity5 and @entity6			0
was @entity5 in fear for his life , as he told investigators , when he and @entity6 struggled for his gun ? did @entity6 have his hands up when he was fatally shot ? we will never know , because there will be no trial			0
that 's a tragedy for the @entity6 family and an affront to the fundamental @entity37 value that we all are equal under the law			1
the grand jury 's decision has implications far beyond @entity7			2
@entity145 polling has found that african - americans have less confidence in the criminal justice system than white @entity146 , while a @entity150 report found that 68 % of @entity151 report being worried about police brutality			0
@entity5 walking free will likely reinforce the views among communities of color that our justice system is unfair			0
and when significant segments of our population lose faith in our justice system , our democracy is weakened			0
the @entity7 decision reflects poorly on prosecutor @entity9			2
his flawed grand jury proceedings ensured that justice was not served for @entity6 .			2

@entity166 : grand jury decided not to indict officer @entity5 ; prosecutor key in this
he says @entity9 compromised grand jury from start , should have recused himself
his giving grand jury *voluminous* evidence made it seem he was acting to protect @entity5
@entity166 : decision an affront to the fundamental @entity37 value we are all are equal under law
