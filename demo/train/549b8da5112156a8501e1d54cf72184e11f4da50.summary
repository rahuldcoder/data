an @entity1 man intended to save the life of his older sister by donating a kidney to her -- a sacrifice on his part that ended in vain a year ago when a nurse mistakenly threw away the donated organ			1
@entity10 and his sister , @entity11 , say the @entity12 " utterly botched " their kidney transplant surgery			1
the medical center this week said it has " worked hard to learn from this incident " and apologized to the family			1
but on tuesday it asked that a lawsuit be dismissed and denied claims of gross negligence and failure to meet accepted standards of care			1
the civil complaint contends @entity10 's right kidney was considered a " perfect match " for his sister , then 24 , who reportedly suffered from end - stage renal disease			1
during the brother 's surgery on august 10 , 2012 , his kidney was placed in a " slush machine " until it could be moved to his sister 's room , where she 'd yet to undergo her surgery			1
a nurse , who was cleaning up , had just returned from a lunch break and thought the kidney was already in @entity11 's room when she discarded the machine 's contents , according to the lawsuit			1
while the kidney was later recovered , it could n't be used because it had been thrown away with other infected or unsterile medical waste , the @entity10 family alleges			1
@entity47 required additional dialysis and four dialysis - related surgeries before she received a replacement kidney three months later , the lawsuit states			2
" when compared to @entity55 's kidney , @entity11 's new kidney is a poorer match and of poorer quality , " and she has a higher risk of rejecting it over time , the lawsuit claims			2
the pair 's parents also claimed they suffered emotional distress and a " loss of consortium , " or loss of family relationships			0
but the @entity1 attorney general contends parents of adult children and siblings can not make such a claim about loss of consortium in such a case			2
each of eight @entity10 family members -- including four other siblings -- are seeking in excess of $ 25,000			0
dr. @entity79 , chancellor and executive vice president for health affairs , @entity12 , said the university " continues to express the sorrow that we feel that this unfortunate incident occurred			0
" " while the legal realities of this situation are complex and ongoing , we have worked hard to learn from this incident and have spread the lessons widely to try to make hospitals and transplant programs safer across the country			0
" in the wake of the incident , the hospital temporarily suspended its live kidney donor program			0
it has since resumed operations			0
the nurse involved in the incident retired from the hospital			0
the surgeon in charge of the planned transplant no longer directs the kidney transplant program but continues to perform them and remains a professor , the @entity12 said			0
