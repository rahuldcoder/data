-- on the one - year anniversary of president @entity4 's inauguration , tens of thousands of @entity1 marched in the streets of @entity6 in an effort to remove him from office			1
the @entity10 described the protesters as " an array of secular and liberal @entity1 , moderate @entity13 , @entity14 â € ” and what the opposition says is a broad sector of the general public that has turned against the @entity13			2
" you would think these protesters represent an @entity1 more favorable or in line with @entity24 interests			1
unfortunately , our government supports the current regime of @entity4 and the @entity28			2
earlier this year , we sent @entity1 's government 20 @entity30 fighter jets , @entity33 tanks and other military aid			1
i introduced an amendment that would halt the transfer of advanced weapons to @entity1			2
i argued that the situation in that country was too volatile and that @entity4 was not someone the @entity24 should necessarily embrace			1
my amendment was defeated in the @entity43 , 79 to 19			0
last week , president @entity44 deployed more than 400 @entity46 soldiers to @entity1 as part of a nine - month " peacekeeping mission , " which could include responding to protestsâ € ” or even riotsâ € ” led potentially by @entity1 seeking a more secular or moderate government			1
our government insists on calling @entity4 an ally			2
@entity4 , on the other hand , has called @entity57 " bloodsuckers " and has said they are the " descendants of apes and pigs			2
" the @entity44 administration announced in march that we no longer had enough money to continue giving @entity61 tours because of the sequester			0
that same month , secretary of state @entity63 met with @entity4 and pledged $ 250 million in additional aid to @entity1			1
before @entity24 supported the @entity28 , we supported @entity4 's predecessor , @entity65			1
for decades , we aided the @entity65 regime to the tune of about $ 60 billion in total			0
when @entity1 protested @entity65 in january 2011 , f - 16 jets were used by @entity65 to intimidate protesters			2
those jets were supplied to @entity1 by the @entity24			1
when hundreds of thousands of @entity1 rallied in @entity72 to protest three decades of martial law , @entity65 doused them with tear gas made in @entity75 and paid for with @entity24 taxpayer 's money			1
@entity65 abused and tortured his people for decades , while we subsidized his government			0
as @entity1 marched in the streets to remove this dictator from power in early 2011 , former vice president @entity80 said we should stand by @entity65 and called him our " good friend			1
" for many @entity1 , the @entity24 was @entity65			1
in their eyes , we were the same			0
to some , we are now undoubtedly morsy			0
indeed , the weapons that were once given to @entity65 or bought with @entity24 dollars are now in the hands of the @entity28			2
@entity1 is just one example of our misguided foreign policy			2
there are multiple examples of our government aiding and abetting despotic regimes in ways that ultimately work against @entity24 interests			0
the same @entity97 leaders who were eager to aid @entity65 , and now @entity4 , were also once the loudest voices for supporting @entity100 dictator @entity99			1
they are the same @entity102 and @entity103 hawks who later insisted we back the @entity100 rebels			0
they are the same people who now demand we fund the @entity109 rebels , even though @entity110 and others who belong to the resistance are also affiliated with @entity113			0
the problem with constantly intervening in these troubled parts of the world is that there are often no clear good guys or bad guys			0
today 's ally can quickly become tomorrow 's enemy			0
this should be a paramount and obvious concern , but in @entity97 it is almost always treated as an afterthought			0
also , what kind of message does funding despots send to the rest of the world ? when @entity65 was our " good friend , " he was certainly no friend to the @entity1 people			1
judging by the protests in @entity6 on sunday , the same can probably be said of @entity4 's regime			0
you can not give people liberty			0
they must fight for it themselves			0
people around the world seek to emulate and embrace our concept of freedom			0
@entity24 should continue to lead , something we often do best by example			1
but what kind of example do we set when we side with the enemies of freedom ? how can we have influence in troubled parts of the world when we cuddle up to regimes responsible for much of the trouble ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			1

@entity157 : why is the @entity24 supporting @entity1 president @entity4 ?
@entity157 : i argued that @entity4 is not someone the @entity24 should necessarily embrace
he says despite @entity1 ' *discontent* with @entity4 , we continue to give him aid
@entity157 : what kind of example do we set when we side with the enemies of freedom ?
