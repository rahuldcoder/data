-- more than 10 million people -- almost one in two men , women and children -- in @entity5 -- are facing a looming catastrophe			1
families are surviving , but only just			2
food and fuel price spikes , coupled with political instability , have left @entity5 's economy in tatters			1
as is often the case , ordinary people are bearing the brunt of this crisis and have exhausted their options for coping with the extreme challenges that they face			2
despite a new president and a political transition process underway , the humanitarian crisis continues to deteriorate			2
the economy has not recovered and food prices have not come down			1
in @entity26 , a western port governorate where the largely rural population relies upon agriculture and fishing for livelihoods , the farming has dropped to a third of its normal production			2
fishermen , large and small - scale farms , alike , can not afford the diesel necessary to power their engines and water pumps -- even when it is available in the market			2
many people lost their jobs during the political turmoil last year , at a time when food prices were skyrocketing			1
like many families in @entity5 with no alternatives , @entity46 's sons left her and their young children to migrate to @entity50 for work			1
she is 60 years old and sits in a one room hut which she built , together with her children , 10 years ago			2
she now shares it with her seven grandchildren			2
she tells me that like many others in the village , her sons were day laborers , and forced to migrate illegally to @entity50 to look for work			0
'' my three sons are now in @entity50			0
they went searching jobs after they lost their jobs here			0
they have n't sent us any money yet			0
last time , one called me saying that they could n't find work and they are still being pursued by the @entity50 police			0
he was saying that he wo n't send us money this month and asked us to find a way to keep going until they get a job			0
" many families talk about selling off their few assets , skipping meals for two to three days at a time and pulling their children from school to just survive			0
with all of their neighbors in the same level of crisis , and the effects of the crises expected to deteriorate further , ordinary @entity5 have exhausted their options			1
over the past year , one in three @entity5 purchased food on credit , and one in four are still falling further into food - related debt			1
@entity46 describes with utmost fatigue how she turned towards creditors as a last resort : " we live on ' please give me , ' ' lend me until tomorrow , ' ' please wait until @entity95 gives me help to return your money ' ; this is our life now			0
" but the creditors and traders can not continue to have stock go out without money coming in			0
they have started to turn away families			0
@entity104 , mother of five , told me about her desperation at being turned away from the trader with tears in her eyes and her very sick child in her arms			0
" they tell you , i am not @entity95 , i can not provide ... even as your child lies there dying			0
" life was always difficult , but the past year has pushed families to their limits			1
@entity46 was among more than 100,000 beneficiaries that received cash from @entity124 's @entity123 - funded @entity122 and @entity125 ( @entity126 ) , created as a quick response to meet people 's inability to purchase food caused by the current crises in the country			1
the project provided cash grants of $ 25 to families for each of three months			0
those that received the payment included a diversity of vulnerable groups such as women , children , chronically - ill , disabled , elderly - headed households , and low income families			0
@entity46 tells me : '' i bought salt , sugar , oil , flour , and medicine for one of my grandsons			0
i also paid off some of my debts			0
those payments were enough to buy food for about 20 or 25 days ... though it 's only 25 days , it was a gift from @entity95			1
" but despite the need for quick solutions like this , which meet people 's immediate needs with dignity and can build towards lasting solutions , funding for humanitarian programmes has not been flowing fast enough			1
food insecurity is at risk of becoming a normal part of life in @entity5 , but the @entity171 humanitarian appeal for the country has been just 43 percent funded			1
the crisis has worsened since the appeal launched in december , so the funds needed to help people in need are likely to increase when the appeal is reviewed this june			2
at this week 's friends of @entity5 meeting in @entity182 , @entity50 , donors pledged a reported $ 4 billion in new funds for the country			1
the pledges are generous and signal that the international community recognizes the dire level of need ; but it is unclear as yet exactly how this money will be spent and when it will arrive in @entity5			1
a good proportion of these funds need to be fast - tracked to meet the urgent humanitarian need			0
almost half of @entity5 do not have enough to eat today and @entity5 is entering its hunger season			1
the world can bring @entity5 back from the brink of catastrophe -- but only if it acts now .			1

@entity124 : 10 million people in @entity5 are on the brink of *starvation*
food and fuel price spikes , coupled with political *unrest* , has hurt @entity5 's economy
one in three @entity5 purchased food on credit in the past year
