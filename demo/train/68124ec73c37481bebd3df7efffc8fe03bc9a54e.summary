-- @entity2 's anti-gay laws are " no problem whatsoever , " according to a leading @entity4 official			1
@entity6 , president of the @entity7 , has called for @entity2 law to be respected ahead of his sport 's world championships , which begin in @entity11 on saturday			1
@entity2 president @entity12 last month signed into effect a law which bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear			1
it has been condemned by @entity2 and international rights groups as highly discriminatory			2
" i do n't feel there is a problem whatsoever , " @entity6 , a member of the @entity21 , told reporters			1
" @entity2 has their laws			2
each athlete can have their own private life , so we wo n't call upon people about this and that			0
" this law has to be respected			0
we are here for the @entity35 and have no problem whatsoever and i 'm not worried at all			1
" the new laws have led to calls for the @entity39 , set to be held in the city of @entity41 , to be taken away from @entity2			2
a 320,000 - signature petition protesting the country 's stance on gay rights ahead of the @entity46 was presented to @entity4 bosses in @entity48 on wednesday			1
responding to the petition , @entity21 ( @entity21 ) president @entity49 reaffirmed the @entity4 movement 's commitment to freedom of expression			1
" the @entity4 charter is clear			2
a sport is a human right and it should be available to all , regardless of race , sex or sexual orientation , " said @entity49 in a statement			0
" as far as the freedom of expression is concerned , of course , this is something that is important			0
" according to the @entity21 's statement , the @entity2 government has confirmed the new legislation will not apply to athletes and tourists during the @entity46			1
" this legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented , particularly as regards the @entity46 in @entity41			0
" as a sporting organization , what we can do is to continue to work to ensure that the @entity46 can take place without discrimination against athletes , officials , spectators and the media			0
" to that end , the @entity21 has received assurances from the highest level of government in @entity2 that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the @entity46			1
" @entity49 's words were welcomed by @entity89 , the gay rights group which delivered the petition to the @entity21 's headquarters in @entity93 , @entity48			1
" this is the strongest and most direct statement we have received from the @entity21 , " all out co-founder and executive director @entity95 said in a statement			0
" it shows the @entity21 is listening to the global outcry against these laws and demanding real answers , not propaganda , from the @entity2 government			1
" when he mentions the importance of freedom of expression , @entity49 is right			0
fundamental freedoms are eroded for all @entity2 -- gay and straight -- under these laws			2
" @entity110 created the games with the dream of ' changing the world through sport '			0
in that spirit , we are calling for the @entity21 to clearly denounce the anti-gay law and do everything in its power to see that it is removed before the @entity4			1
" @entity2 's sports minister @entity121 , speaking at the same press conference as @entity6 , urged journalists to " calm down " before defending the new law			1
" in addition to this law , we have a constitution that guarantees all rights to private life , " insisted @entity121			0
" this law is not intended to deprive any people of any religion , of any race , of any sexual orientation , but to ban the promotion of non-traditional relations among the younger generations			0
" all sports athletes and organizations should be relaxed			0
all their rights will be protected			0
" you have to respect the laws of the country you are coming to			0
this is a sports festival and we only have to talk about it			0
" @entity147 president @entity146 spoke out on the issue on tuesday 's @entity150 show , condemning the laws as against the spirit of the @entity4			1
" i 've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights , when it comes to people 's basic freedoms , that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race , religion , gender or sexual orientation , you are violating the basic morality that i think should transcend every country , " said @entity146			2
@entity146 this week canceled a one - on - one meeting with @entity12 which had been scheduled for september			1
the reason given by the @entity167 was @entity2 's decision to grant asylum to @entity171 leaker @entity170 and " lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control , " while also mentioning human rights issues			1
@entity178 : an uneven playing field in june @entity146 visited @entity181 's native @entity180 , where homosexuality is illegal			2
@entity146 called for all @entity184 citizens to be treated equally , but @entity180 's president @entity185 insisted the country is " not ready " to decriminalize homosexuality			1
@entity189 broadcaster @entity188 penned an open letter to his country 's prime minister @entity191 , @entity21 president @entity49 and @entity195 chief @entity194 calling for the @entity46 to be taken away from @entity2			1
there has been a groundswell of international concern over the anti-gay propaganda law and its potential impact on visitors to @entity2 for the @entity46			2
protests have ranged from a number of bars around the world announcing a boycott of @entity2 vodka to calls from some quarters for a boycott of the @entity46 themselves			0
however , some gay athletes insist the @entity46 must go ahead in @entity41			0
" i 'm fully against a boycott , " @entity214 speed skater @entity213 told @entity0			0
" the @entity4 have been very important to me and i know that a lot of people like myself have worked very hard for these games			0
" it 's very important for the world to show up in @entity41 and be united in this issue , to bring light to and start a conversation about what is going on			0
" @entity147 figure skater @entity225 , who is married to a @entity2 - @entity147 man , says the flamboyant nature of his sport means that he can make a stance in @entity41			1
" i 'm quite well known in @entity2 so my sheer presence is a big statement against this anti-propaganda law , " he told @entity0			2
former @entity4 diving champion @entity233 says it is difficult to balance the sporting desires of athletes with the need to make a political point against the @entity2 law			1
" boycotts hurt the wrong people , they hurt the athletes , but we ca n't ignore what 's going on in @entity41 , " said the @entity147 , who missed the @entity241 due to a boycott and was also affected by @entity244 retaliation in snubbing the 1984 @entity46			2
" it 's a birthright to pursue love and not be incarcerated for loving and wanting to find love , " he told @entity0 .			0
