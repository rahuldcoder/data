@entity0 -- with all the fuss in the media at the moment about @entity7 's @entity6 anyone could be forgiven for thinking that the @entity8 are united in their adoration of their monarch			1
the reality is that while a large swathe of public opinion is largely indifferent to the royals -- but happy to have an extra public holiday to mark the jubilee -- many millions want the whole institution of monarchy consigned to the history books			1
the @entity8 republican movement has been growing rapidly over the past 18 months -- thanks in large part to the heightened royal coverage prompted by last year 's wedding of prince @entity25 and @entity26 and this year 's jubilee			2
our cause is simple : it 's about democratic reform and a rejection of inherited power and privilege			2
the case for @entity8 becoming a republic is threefold : the monarchy is wrong in principle , in practice and it is wrong politically			1
we 're supposed to be a democratic society , which means we should cherish and value democratic values , such as equality of citizenship , freedom to participate in government , accountability and transparency			0
in a democratic society there is no room for a head of state who is put there for life and by birth			1
a hereditary monarch has no place in a society that believes " we the people " should be in charge			0
the principled objection is unanswerable			0
in practice the monarchy is an institution that is not fit for purpose			1
it is secretive , having recently lobbied successfully to have itself removed entirely from the reaches of our freedom of information laws ; it lobbies government ministers for improvements to its financial benefits and for its own private agenda ; it is hugely costly -- an estimated Â £ 202 million a year , enough to pay for thousands of teachers , nurses or police officers at a time of sweeping public spending cuts			0
the queen and prince @entity83 must be asked for consent before our elected parliament is able to debate any legislation that affects their private interests -- that consent is sought in secret and we have no idea whether , how or how many times it has been used			2
politically the monarchy is wrong because -- contrary to what is believed by many here and abroad -- it is a central feature of our unwritten constitution			1
the " @entity99 " is the supreme authority in this country -- not the people			0
@entity99 has vast powers that can not be challenged in a court of law and those powers are exercised by the queen on the instruction of our prime minister			2
those powers include considerable patronage -- the ability to appoint bishops , government ministers , heads of public bodies and so on -- as well as the power to go to war , sign treaties and change the law through the little - understood @entity118			0
thanks to the @entity99 there is almost no limit to the power of our politicians other than those limits they place upon themselves ( such as our @entity125 , which they have the power to repeal )			0
the pomp of the monarchy is a neat way of distracting from this highly questionable constitutional arrangement			2
it is the power of the @entity99 and the authority it gives our politicians that most likely explains the hostility every government has shown the republican movement			0
but rather than engage with the issue on these serious matters most monarchists instead implore us to believe in fantasy and make - believe			1
" the queen has never put a foot wrong " is the time - honored @entity146 © , along with " but what about all the tourism the monarchy generates ? " the tourism argument goes that as @entity8 has a monarchy and also attracts a lot of tourists , the monarchy obviously acts as a great tourism magnet and therefore generates millions of pounds of revenue and economic activity			1
the problem is that there are no facts to back this up			0
does the monarchy pay its way ? there is no reason to believe that if @entity8 abandoned the monarchy tourism would suffer -- that 's something even the head of official tourism agency @entity169 has acknowledged			1
our history is certainly an attraction -- and the great thing about our history is that it will always be there regardless of what we do in the future			2
selling hotel rooms and " @entity184 " t - shirts is , anyway , no reason to abandon a proud ambition for democratic reform			0
as for the queen , well we really have no idea how she has done her job given that most of it is done behind closed doors			2
there has never been any real scrutiny of her role and she has never had to compete in open and free competition for the job			0
if keeping quiet and cutting ribbons is all we can expect of our head of state then perhaps we can agree she 's done well -- but surely we can expect more			1
as a national figurehead and leading public figure the queen has utterly failed to do anything of note or worth			0
after 60 years who can quote a famous speech or point to a moment of crisis or celebration when the queen offered leadership and inspiration ? for all the failures of the monarchy -- in principle , practice and in political terms -- the queen and the institution offer little in return but an empty chair where an inspiring national figure could have stood			1
these are the reasons why come the jubilee , republicans will be rejecting the celebrations and demanding real democratic change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

millions want monarchy consigned to history , argues @entity230 of @entity235 group
@entity235 says monarchy is wrong in principle , in practice and politically
no room in democracy for head of state who is put there for life and by birth , @entity230 says
most monarchists implore us to believe in fantasy about queen 's role , he adds
