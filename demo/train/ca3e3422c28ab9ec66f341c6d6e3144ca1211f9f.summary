-- as any seasoned observer of the political dance could have predicted , @entity2 's debate performance on wednesday completed his full - circle journey of ideology			1
when @entity2 ran for governor of @entity8 in 2002 ( and for senator in 1994 ) he was a @entity11 moderate in the mold of his father			1
when he began his marathon run ( s ) for president way back in the middle of the last decade he went through a battlefield conversion			0
he morphed into a " severely " conservative primary candidate , leaning so far to the right he might have suffered from mild attacks of vertigo			0
wednesday night a national audience witnessed a kind of homecoming as @entity2 embraced the successes of his adopted blue state			1
@entity2 's ardor for the good times he had as governor came after he spent the last two cycles of @entity11 primaries ridiculing @entity8 ' liberal tendencies , describing his experience among the lefties as being " a vegetarian at a cattle ranch			1
" the @entity2 we saw on wednesday was subtly different			1
he loved education , hated tax deductions , enjoyed working with @entity39 and claimed the @entity41 precursor of @entity42 as his own			0
@entity2 starts to fill in blanks on his tax plan he told the debate 's moderator , @entity45 : " @entity45 , i had the great experience -- it did n't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 % @entity52			1
and that meant i figured out from day one i had to get along and i had to work across the aisle to get anything done			0
we drove our schools to be no. 1 in the nation			0
we cut taxes 19 times			0
" in short , he painted a portrait of bipartisan bliss			1
the passage of presidential candidates from the extreme margins of their parties ' base to the center is as predictable as the annual migration of buzzards from @entity75 to @entity76 , @entity77			0
still , as a public service , a quick examination of @entity2 's new embrace of @entity8 is in order			1
but before we get into the details , tuck away this truism on the ways of @entity8 politics			1
governors come and go ; the overriding constant is an overwhelming @entity39 majority in the state legislature			0
it has the final , veto - proof say on budgets , laws and policy			0
to credit any @entity8 governor for a balanced budget or blame him for a high unemployment rate is akin to holding him responsible for the weather			1
let 's take it by categories			0
education in the debate , @entity2 stressed the importance of education , noting more than once that @entity8 leads the nation in education outcomes			1
this is largely true , depending on which metric you use ( and if you ignore the fact that there are poorer communities in the state that resemble the education outcomes of @entity117 and @entity118 )			0
but what was @entity2 's role in all this ? he inherited an education system that had been trending to the top of national rankings over the previous decade			1
in 2003 , the year he took office , @entity8 high school seniors were first in sat scores and among the top three in percentage of students taking the test			1
the state continued to rank at the top during and after @entity2 's term			1
@entity8 public schools receive state aid under a law called @entity138			1
the budget ritual begins with the governor setting a number for @entity138 distributions			0
that is usually changed when the legislature 's budget committees take over			0
in his 2004 fiscal year proposal ( the state 's budget calendar runs from july 1 to june 30 ) @entity2 actually budgeted more chapter 70 money than the legislature settled on			1
but there is an asterisk that goes with that			0
opinion : @entity2 's demographic bind @entity2 's plan would have robbed @entity158 to pay @entity159 , cutting other state aid to municipalities to fund his largess to education			2
the legislature smoothed the differences by returning some of the education money to the other account			0
in subsequent budget years the legislature raised @entity2 's proposed education funding by amounts ranging from $ 3 million to $ 50 million on total chapter 70 funding of $ 3 billion annually , according to state records			1
@entity2 gets average marks when it comes to other education issues			2
his administration launched no major initiatives or reforms			0
higher education funding and the state university system 's infrastructure languished in his four years as governor -- a time , to be fair , when there was little additional money in the budget			2
budget / taxes @entity2 brags that he did n't raise taxes in @entity8 even though the state budget faced a $ 3 billion budget gap when he took office			1
it is true ; he did n't			0
instead he proposed , and the legislature accepted , dozens of increases on state fees			0
marriage licenses went from $ 4 to $ 50			0
the cost of registering deeds and mortgages quadrupled ( $ 25 to $ 100 ) and driving permits doubled to $ 30			0
@entity2 also proposed raising the firearms registration fee from $ 25 to $ 75			2
despite howls from gun owners , the legislature joined in and raised the fee to $ 100 while extending the life of the license from four to six years			0
@entity2 's proposal included a new $ 10 fee to acquire a state certificate of blindness and $ 15 for a photo identification card			2
the legislature removed that provision			0
the total revenue raised by @entity2 and the legislature remains a matter of debate			1
@entity2 's campaign says fees rose a total of $ 240 million in the 2004 fiscal budget ; others , including the @entity224 , put the figure around $ 500 million			2
another matter in the @entity2 revenue debate is the $ 350 million to $ 375 million he raised annually for three years by closing business tax loopholes			2
@entity2 has contended his move was not a tax increase			2
@entity8 business organizations had a different opinion at the time			1
so did his @entity11 rivals during the brutal primary season			0
opinion : @entity2 shakes up the race @entity2 did benefit from a tax increase - a $ 1.1 billion tax hike passed by @entity39 a year before he took office -- that helped cut the looming deficit			1
on the other side of the coin , @entity2 's claim of 19 tax cuts during his term is a bit too self - generous by definition and scope since a number of " cuts " originated in the legislature			1
among them , a one - year delay in a capital gains tax increase enacted before he took office , prescription drug and property tax relief for seniors , tax breaks for commuters and veterans , a business deduction for installing automatic sprinkler systems , extensions of temporary tax breaks and two ritual sales tax holidays for one weekend in august			0
working with the opposition in criticizing @entity269 's testy relationship with @entity11 in @entity270 , @entity2 proudly noted his good times with @entity8 @entity39 legislators			1
" i like the fact that in my state , we had @entity11 and @entity39 come together and work together , " @entity2 scolded the president			2
" what you did instead was to push through a plan without a single @entity11 vote			0
" @entity2 's situation was something of a mirror image			2
he was unable to push anything through that the @entity39 leadership did n't like , including 800 vetoes @entity2 issued as governor			1
the legislature overrode all but a few vetoes issued when it was out of session			0
on wednesday night @entity2 used his weekly meetings with the @entity294 speaker and @entity296 president as evidence of his ability to work with the other side			2
the meetings did happen , but not as a result of @entity2 's initiative			2
these weekly sessions have been a regular part of the @entity306 schedule going back at least to the administration of @entity308			0
they took place during the 12 years @entity11 held the governorship before @entity2 took office and they continue today			2
@entity39 lawmakers of the time recall @entity2 as a ceo type who dealt only with the legislative leadership			1
even @entity319 , the former @entity294 speaker who went on to host a conservative talk radio show in @entity321 , recalls @entity2 as being imperious when he called legislative leaders in to discuss the budget crisis			2
" initially his sense was , ` i have been elected governor , i am the ceo here , and you guys are the board of directors and you monitor the implementation of what i say , ' " @entity319 told @entity324 in august			0
" that ruffled the feathers of legislators who see themselves as an equal branch ( of government )			0
" opinion : the audacity of @entity2 's @entity340 ironically , the single biggest bipartisan achievement during his administration was the state 's health care reform law that requires all residents to buy health insurance -- i.e. the individual mandate of @entity42			1
legislators of that time give @entity2 high marks for working with them to get the law refined and passed			1
the same lawmakers note , with pride , that the @entity2 - @entity39 love fest resulted in legislation that was a model for @entity42			1
welcome home , @entity357 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity360 .			2

@entity2 painted a portrait of bipartisan bliss in his time as @entity8 governor
@entity360 says the truth was more complex and *nuanced*
he says @entity2 had no choice but to *cooperate* with a @entity52 - *dominated* legislature
@entity360 : he takes too much credit for things done by others ; health care was a *breakthrough*
