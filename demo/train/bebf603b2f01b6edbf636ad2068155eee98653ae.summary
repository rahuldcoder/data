-- like so many @entity5 service members before them , the bodies of sgt. @entity2 and pvt. @entity3 returned late thursday to @entity7 in @entity8 , the most recent deaths of the war in @entity11			2
but in some ways , the differences in their deaths could n't be more striking than the 4,400 that came before them			0
the men , who died tuesday , are the first two americans killed in @entity11 since the @entity5 ended its combat role there after seven years			1
a september 1 ceremony , held at @entity20 in @entity21 , marked the conclusion of the @entity5 combat mission dubbed @entity24 and the transfer to the assistance mission , named @entity24			1
in their new role , @entity5 troops are expected to advise and assist @entity11 's security forces , back @entity11 troops in counterterrorism missions and protect @entity5 civilians there during a transitional period			1
some 50,000 @entity5 troops remain in @entity11			1
unless the @entity5 and @entity11 forge a new agreement , all @entity5 troops are scheduled to depart @entity11 by the end of 2011			1
ironically , @entity2 and @entity3 were killed by an @entity11 soldier			0
the attack occurred inside an @entity11 army commando compound when the soldier , clad in an @entity11 army uniform , fired on the @entity5 soldiers near the @entity45 city of @entity46 , the @entity5 military said			1
the attacker was shot and killed			0
maj. gen. @entity48 , a @entity49 spokesman , identified the shooter as @entity51 , from the @entity11 army 's @entity52			0
@entity54 said @entity51 got into a fight with @entity5 soldiers , and then pulled his weapon and fired on them before he was fatally shot			2
a joint @entity5 - @entity11 investigation into the incident is under way			2
the soldiers were part of a security element for a @entity5 company commander who was meeting with members of @entity11 security forces at the compound			2
the bodies of @entity2 and @entity3 arrived at @entity7 on a cool , clear night , along with the bodies of two @entity71 killed in @entity72			0
a military chaplain prayed over their transfer cases before they were unloaded from a military charter and brought before their families -- families that may not have expected to lose loved ones after @entity5 's military role was over			0
@entity0 's @entity82 contributed to this report .			0
