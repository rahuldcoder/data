@entity1 , @entity0 -- pharmacies in @entity0 are reporting a run on supplies like surgical masks , thermometers and anti-bacterial gels by customers concerned about swine flu amid a surge in the number of people infected by the virus			1
a box of leaflets containing information about swine flu , distributed by the @entity20 's @entity19			1
in some cases , drug stores in @entity0 say they are out of the items and may not get more in for weeks or months			1
" people are very panicked , " said a pharmacy assistant at @entity25 in southwest @entity26			2
" that 's why everyone is running for thermometers , surgical masks , and anti-bacterial gels			1
" the @entity20 's @entity19 estimated this week that there were around 100,000 new cases of swine flu in @entity0 in the week ending july 17 -- nearly double the number of cases for the previous seven days			1
the @entity20 has been hit hard by the @entity38 virus , with only the @entity39 and @entity40 recording more cases of infection , according to @entity43 figures earlier this month			1
the @entity43 has stopped giving a global tally of cases but said friday that swine flu has now spread to more than 160 areas and territories in the world			1
at least 26 people have died of the disease and this week the @entity20 government set up a national flu hot line and web site to allow those suspected of having swine flu to get a prescription for antiviral medication over the phone			1
those who are given prescriptions must pick up the medication at designated collection points in their area			0
but at @entity65 in @entity26 , a supply of surgical masks that normally lasts for half a year has gone in three days , said pharmacy assistant @entity68			1
@entity68 displayed a receipt from the chemist 's suppliers that showed three types of digital thermometers that were out of stock			0
the pharmacy is now out of thermometers			0
" one of the manufacturers , he said the next thermometers they will have is in october , so now there is no chance to get them from this particular supplier , " she told @entity2			0
the supplier is also out of stock of three different types of anti-bacterial gel , she said , even though the gel is ineffective against viruses			0
@entity91 in @entity92 , in northern @entity0 , is also out of thermometers , pharmacist @entity90 told @entity2			1
he said he believes most shops and pharmacies in the area are also out			2
" there 's no thermometers at all , which is worrying because it 's just a sign that it 's going to impact on other supplies as well linked to people generally not feeling well -- in particular paracetamol ( acetaminophen ) , ibuprofen , and other medications , " @entity90 said			2
the pharmacy was out of stock of anti-bacterial gels last month , but manufacturers are making more so it 's back on the shelf , he said			2
however , it 's being sold for nearly double the price , he said			0
" they 're pennies otherwise to buy , but very quickly some manufacturers have got into the market of producing gels and their prices are quite high , " @entity90 said			2
at their sister pharmacy in nearby @entity122 , any anti-bacterial products at the checkout counter are " gone in a day , rather than in a month , " he said			2
" some of the gels do n't do anything different to your soap at home , " he said , emphasizing that good hygiene , good handwashing , and disposable tissues are the best way to ward off viral infection			2
" there 's definitely some kind of misunderstanding -- people are thinking that having those type of products will give them a bit more confidence			2
but it 's their choice , obviously			0
" though @entity91 does not normally sell surgical masks , they considered stocking some when the virus broke out a few months ago , @entity90 said			1
they decided against it so as not to stoke panic			0
" it could be seen as a sign of endorsement rather than asking people to get advice , " he said			2
" it would just give a very visible panic message			0
" @entity155 , south of @entity26 , still has stocks of thermometers despite higher demand , but it has run out of surgical masks , said pharmacist @entity161			1
he said the pharmacy has noticed a rise in people asking questions and wanting information about swine flu			1
" i think the reaction has been in response to what they 've heard on the news , " @entity161 said			0
" and even where it is not a true case of the patient suffering , they still want more information			0
but i think generally we 've been able to give them what they need			0
" a branch of the boots pharmacy chain in @entity185 , southwest @entity26 , has been out of thermometers for two weeks , said employee @entity187			0
they 're also running out of anti-bacterial gels ; the store does n't stock surgical masks			1
while it is not running out yet , one pharmacy in the eastern @entity0 city of @entity194 said it is noticing an increase in demand for masks , thermometers , and anti-bacterial items			1
" it 's not completely a foregone situation where i ca n't get hold of it , but it 's becoming difficult , " said the pharmacist , who asked not to be identified because his pharmacy is one of the government 's distribution points for the antiviral medication @entity205 , and he did n't want to spark concern			1
the pharmacist said he was doling out @entity205 to 70 to 80 people a day and described the lack of supplies as worrying			1
" from a business point of view , yes , and from a clinical point of view , yes , because i ca n't offer the services i need to , " he said			0
" and if people want reassurance from ( the supplies ) , i 'm not able to reassure them			2
" the pharmacist complained that the paperwork he is required to fill out for each patient takes him five minutes per person , giving him less time to spend consulting with other customers			0
" i wish somebody would have organized it a little bit better , " the pharmacist said			0
@entity90 , of @entity91 , said the run on supplies makes him worry that they wo n't be available later in the year , when flu season kicks in			0
" manufacturers would have made their plans for winter a while ago , but if we 're consuming these products early , in august and july , i do n't know if those manufacturing plans are in place yet , " he said			0
the government advises anyone suspected of having swine flu to send a friend or relative -- a " flu friend " -- to their pharmacy to pick up the medicine for them			1
but that advice is n't being followed by everyone			0
" some patients come in directly rather than ask their friend to come , " said @entity187 , of @entity255 pharmacy in @entity185			0
he said one dispenser has come down with swine flu after being infected by a sick customer .			1
