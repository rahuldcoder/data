i look forward to getting the results			0

but on saturday , he said , his wife was ill , resting in bed all day suffering from laryngitis , which the actress treated with herbal tea , ginger and lemon			1
" she was on herbal remedies that would n't speed up her heart , " @entity1 said			2
" there was nothing here that could endanger her ; there was prescription medication in the house for her female time and some cough syrup			0
" asked point - blank if a drug overdose was a possible cause of death , @entity1 replied , " i can get rid of that one right now , " he said			2
last saturday , the couple just relaxed in bed , watching three movies as @entity2 prepared to cast her vote as a member of the @entity82			2

her big dream next year was to have a child , and we talked about how he or she would look			0

" she tried to gain weight but had one of those metabolisms -- a high metabolism -- but enjoyed food as much as anyone			0
i wish i could show all the receipts from the take out restaurants , " he said			0
" we are faced with this ridiculous reality that people out there believe she felt , ' oh , poor me , i 'm fat , i 'm thin			0
' @entity2 did n't see beauty as a physical thing , which i 'm bloody lucky for , " he said with a laugh			2
" i know there was a disparity in how we looked and i 'm no movie star , but she always saw the person			0
" @entity1 said he has been upset by some of the published reports			2
" it 's horrible -- the death of a beautiful young woman , a @entity110 icon ; it has to be explained			0
it just ca n't be a tragic accident , " he said , trying to explain the headlines			0
" we do n't want to accept that a beautiful young wife and daughter woke up one morning and died a tragic death			0

" i do n't know if she will ever recover , and i know when she reads all this nonsense about her son - in - law and her deceased daughter , her heart is breaking			0
she has lived with us and saw the love and support			0
