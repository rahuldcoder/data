-- after losing a close friend to liver failure , @entity1 spent a lot of time thinking about how she wanted to live out her days			1
contemplating death brought clarity to her life , but she struggled to maintain perspective amid the daily grind			2
she wondered whether other people went through the same struggle , and what mattered to them			1
she decided to invite others to share those thoughts by painting a chalkboard on the side of an abandoned house in @entity19 stenciled with the sentence " before i die i want to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _			1
" what began as an experiment in making a public space into a shared space has become a global art project , with more than 400 " before i die " walls in 60 countries and 25 languages			1
it 's been quite the journey for @entity31 , who did not launch the project with plans to expand beyond @entity19			1
but it resonated among pockets of passionate people around the globe			1
" our public spaces are as profound as we allow them to be , " @entity31 , an artist , designer and urban planner , said in an e-mail			1
" our public spaces are our shared spaces , and they have a lot of potential to offer us a more valuable and meaningful kind of life			1
i think about why we came together in the first place			2
some of the earliest gathering places were graves and sacred groves			2
we gathered so we could grieve together and worship together and console one another and be alone together			2
" many of the walls disappear a few months after they 're " born , " just like @entity31 's did , after someone bought the building and renovated it			1
then , others pop up			2
in honor of the release of the first book celebrating before i die 's global footprint , we asked @entity31 to reflect upon the most common themes expressed in the walls			1
hopefully , they inspire you to reconsider your hopes , dreams and aspirations			1
well - being " before i die " came out of @entity31 's grief and depression , and the responses " have reassured me that i 'm not alone as i try to make sense of myself , " she said			1
" @entity79 said it 's easier to go to the moon than it is to penetrate one 's own being			0
mental health takes as much exertion as physical health , " she said			0
examples : " abandon all insecurities " ( @entity19 ) " come to terms with who i am " ( @entity93 ) " slow down for a moment and maybe even stop " ( @entity94 , @entity95 ) " find serenity " ( @entity98 , @entity99 ) " stop being afraid " ( @entity100 ) " overcome depression " ( @entity102 , @entity103 ) " lose my fear of death " ( @entity107 , @entity108 ) " find what i 'm looking for ( @entity110 ) " @entity111 " ( @entity112 ) " find closure " ( @entity114 , @entity115 ) " keep getting better every day " ( @entity116 , @entity117 ) " feel comfortable in my skin " ( @entity120 festival ) " reach my constant happiness " ( @entity122 ) " learn to be brave " ( @entity123 , @entity124 ) " right all my wrongs " ( @entity126 ) " learn how to enjoy myself and let go " ( @entity127 , @entity128 ) " feel that nothing was missing or left over " ( @entity130 , @entity131 ) 2			0
love " love and be loved " is one of the most common responses on walls around the world , @entity31 said			1
she 's also seen budding romance on walls			1
" in @entity19 , someone wrote , ' before i die i want to eat a salad with an alien , ' and someone else drew an arrow and wrote ' before i die i want to marry this person , ' " she said			1
examples : " @entity147 " ( @entity148 , @entity149 ) " sleep with a harp player " ( @entity151 , @entity152 ) " get married for the 10th time " ( @entity154 ) " find and kiss her one last time " ( @entity156 ) " find my true love " ( @entity158 ) " love recklessly again " ( @entity19 ) " find my other half " ( @entity160 ) " accompany him forever " ( @entity116 , @entity117 ) " be loved unconditionally " ( @entity162 , @entity163 ) 3			0
travel who does n't have a long list of places they 'd like to visit ? travel can be the hardest thing to find the time and money to invest in , but that does n't stop us from dreaming and plotting adventures			0
" my family had a big white van that we drove all over the place when i was a kid , " @entity31 said			0
" ever since , traveling has been my school and my therapy			0
i 've taken many road trips across @entity181 , and i worked in @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and beyond			0
those experiences deeply shaped who i am today			0
it 's made me more open - minded , reflective , compassionate , and grateful			0
" examples : " travel around the world by foot " ( @entity123 , @entity124 ) " ride a motorcycle across @entity181 " ( @entity148 , @entity149 ) " take my wife to @entity196 " ( @entity94 , @entity194 ) " ride my bike up the top ten highest mountains in @entity198 " ( @entity197 , @entity198 ) " visit @entity203 with the love of my life " ( @entity201 , @entity202 ) " @entity206 " ( @entity207 , @entity208 ) " travel across @entity209 on a bike " ( @entity211 , @entity209 ) " straddle the @entity212 " ( @entity19 ) " @entity213 " ( @entity214 , @entity215 ) " enjoy a pleasant cruise " ( @entity216 , @entity217 ) 4			0
helping others many of us say we 'd like to " donate lots of money , " " change a child 's life , " " help my neighbor " or " build a public school and a shelter			2
" but putting others ahead of ourselves can be a tall order for some , especially in an era of instant gratification			0
but , it 's never too late , said @entity31 , and even the smallest gesture can last a lifetime			0
" i 'll never forget a middle school art teacher who encouraged me when i was full of self - doubt , a neighbor who fixed my bike pedal or a stranger who went out of his way to return my lost bag			2
compassion lasts much longer than the moment			0
" examples : " teach kids to live love and be free " ( @entity185 ) " save lives " ( @entity250 ) " help people through neuroscience " ( @entity94 , @entity194 ) " @entity256 's car " ( @entity253 , @entity254 ) " make someone 's day " ( @entity258 , @entity259 ) " see a just society " ( @entity160 ) " do something for animals and make the world a better place " ( @entity211 , @entity209 ) 5			1
family " making this project made me realize how much more i want to know my parents , " @entity31 said			2
" i 'm glad we 're at a stage where we 're good friends now , and i ask them fifty questions for every photograph from their childhood			0
each week , my dad sends me endearing stories that only enhance the inspiring mythology of our lives			0
" examples : " bring peace of mind to my mom " ( @entity126 ) " see my youngest fly " ( @entity285 ) " see where my grandma grew up " ( @entity287 , @entity208 ) " see my parents again " ( @entity114 , @entity115 ) " speak with my children one last time " ( @entity148 , @entity288 ) " make my parents proud " ( burning man festival ) " see my daughter graduate " ( @entity19 ) " be back in my kid 's life " ( @entity214 , @entity215 ) " build a house for my mother " ( @entity107 , @entity108 ) " meet my daughter " ( @entity112 ) " be a grandfather " ( @entity160 ) " take care of my parents " ( @entity211 ) " have seven children " ( @entity300 , @entity301 ) " raise good kids " ( @entity303 , @entity304 )			0
