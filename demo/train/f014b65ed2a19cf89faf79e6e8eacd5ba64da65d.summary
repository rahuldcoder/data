-- @entity2 of @entity3 , in a satellite city called @entity4 , @entity6 's vision of a flowing , organic architecture halts the tedium of a relentlessly box - shaped cityscape			1
his two residential towers are alike in their sinuous curvilinearity -- which enraptured locals nicknamed " @entity13 " -- but were designed separately			1
the first tower was so beloved by @entity15 , a second was commissioned and completed last year			0
since winning this first big international commission in 2006 , @entity6 's eight - year - old @entity18 firm @entity17 has made a name for itself as a leading exponent of urban design that 's both futuristic and respectful of nature			1
their projects include breathtaking museums and towers in the @entity28 cities of @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , but @entity33 's @entity32 are @entity6 's favorite			1
he was only 30 years old when his design was commissioned			2
" i 'd never built a building before , and that was a huge building			1
i had to figure out how to assemble my team , how to build a high rise			1
i did n't know it was so complicated to make a building , " he said			2
view a hi - res gallery of @entity6 's ' @entity46 ' achieved with the help of @entity3 architect @entity49 and structural engineer @entity50 , the first tower is 170 meters tall , with elliptical floor plates that twist at varying points depending on corresponding features in the landscape			1
today , @entity6 says he 's glad he did n't know how difficult it would be to execute his vision -- he might not have tried if he had			1
" i was so confident about what i proposed , because i was thinking about the city			0
" the city appreciated it			0
" architecture lives in @entity4 at long last , " wrote one critic , who compared the building 's sashaying , ribbed shape to the pleated , body - draping garments of fashion designer @entity67			1
another critic deemed it " sassy , sexy and irreverent toward the formal pieties of cereal - box skyscraper modernism " , and a comeback to " @entity3 developers who complain that they ca n't build and sell anything except the same boring stuff we 've been seeing since the @entity75			2
" i did n't try to make it sexy , just not a box , " @entity6 says			2
" i 'm trying to express nature in big cities			2
i grew up in the old neighborhood of @entity18 where you had a courtyard and trees			0
actually , the whole of @entity18 was a garden -- the @entity89 -- and the lakes and gardens in the city center were all artificial , " he said			0
watch ' @entity93 " i think that 's a good pattern for future cities			0
there must be a way to combine the high rise and high density environment with nature			1
maybe we can have our gardens in the sky			0
we can link different buildings in the sky , and we can have a waterfall in a high rise			2
" the building @entity6 most wishes he had designed is the @entity110 by @entity111 who , like @entity6 , studied at @entity113			1
located in @entity114 , @entity115 , the building was commissioned by the inventor of the polio vaccine , dr @entity119 , who wanted to create a place where scientists could be inspired			1
@entity111 designed two parallel buildings with protruding towers which afford space for study			1
the six - storey structures are separated by a light - filled , marble plaza with a central water channel leading out toward the @entity130			0
@entity131 : your favorite buildings the building 's use of concrete is widely praised , but @entity6 says he particularly likes its relationship to its environment			1
" when people are in the central plaza , they feel so connected to nature , to the sky and the ocean , emotionally			0
i always imagine in 100 or 200 years , when people go there , they will feel the same , " he said			0
" i went there two or three years ago for the first time			0
i arrived there at midnight so i had to climb into the place , and was guided out by security			0
" it was in the dark , so it looked different from the pictures -- everyone knows these pictures ; you have the building on both sides and the ocean and sky in front -- but in the evenings , it 's like a black hole , " he says			2
" the end is a void and it 's horizontal not vertical , so you do n't feel you 're small and helpless			0
when you 're in that space you feel you 're the center , and you can talk to your future			0

@entity28 architect @entity6 's favorite design is the @entity32 in @entity4 , @entity174
locals have nicknamed the twisting residential towers " @entity13 " on *account* of their sinuous curves
the building he wishes he 'd designed is @entity111 's @entity110 in @entity114 , @entity115
@entity6 aims to combine high - rise and high - density environments with nature , he says
