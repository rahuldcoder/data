@entity0 , @entity1 -- some of the families camped outside the @entity5 mine , waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground , fear @entity1 president @entity8 may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity			1
@entity8 visited the mine sunday and spoke with the trapped workers			1
he also presented their families with a copper plate engraved with the words miners first used to tell rescuers they were alive , " we 're fine , in the shelter , all 33			2
" " this is all politics			0
it 's trickery and propaganda			2
they 're playing with the feelings of our loved ones , " said @entity27 , mother of trapped miner @entity28			2
the mine rescue appears to have boosted @entity8 's popularity at a time when he was under fire in other parts of the country			1
in the south of @entity1 , @entity8 is battling a hunger strike by 34 @entity42 , part of the indigenous group 's ongoing campaign for independence			1
along the central and southern coast , some @entity1 accuse the government of being too slow to rebuild after the february earthquake and tsunami			2
but his overall approval rating surged to 56 percent in august , according to a survey by @entity54 , a 10 percent increase over the july numbers			0
the @entity1 research company said the increase was " directly related with the rescue operations of the trapped miners in the @entity5 mine			1
" when the workers first sent word that they were alive , @entity8 triumphantly waved their written note before television cameras			2
sunday was his fifth visit to the mine			1
outside the mine sunday , some family members said they were angry that the rescue effort was being turned into a political spectacle			1
" we know politicians want to show off , but i do n't care about the politics			0
all i care about is that the president gets our boys out , " said @entity72 , wife of miner @entity73			0
the sister of another trapped miner accused rescuers of delaying the switch - on of a recently - assembled oil rig -- the so - called @entity83 drill -- until @entity8 arrived sunday			1
she also claimed rescuers discovered the miners were alive in an underground shelter in the early hours of august 22 , but waited until midday to officially announce the news , after @entity8 arrived at the mine			1
she declined to be named for fear of losing her job for anti-government comments			0
" we 're still not free in @entity1 to speak our mind , " she said			2
another woman , the wife of one of the miners , said families were sometimes not given information in a timely fashion			0
the woman , who asked not to be named for fear of unspecified reprisals , said she did not bother to wait in the hot sun to meet the president sunday			0
" i got tired of waiting and i 'm bored of the way he 's doing things			0
the mining minister and the rescuers have done a good job , but the president is playing with us , " she said			0
not all relatives , however , felt frustrated by political overtones in the rescue effort			0
" we have to be calm			0
@entity122 works on his own schedule and we have to wait patiently , " said @entity118 , daughter of trapped miner @entity120			2
the president arrived at the mine at midmorning sunday , flying in on a military helicopter that landed in the desert , kicking up dust			2
he spent about an hour and a half at the mine			0
he met 5 - day - old @entity131 , the daughter of @entity132 , one of the trapped miners -- and kissed her in front of television cameras			1
@entity131 was brought to the mine for the first time sunday by her mother , @entity138			1
watch how miners ' families marked independence day " hopefully this spirit of unity , faith , confidence and pride to be @entity1 that is in the air at the @entity5 mine and in every corner of @entity1 is a spirit that will illuminate this third century of independence , " @entity8 said , referring to @entity1 's recent bicentennial celebration			1
away from reporters , @entity8 first visited a powerful oil drill that has been transported to the mine to assist in the rescue			1
the drill , known as @entity158 , began operating sunday			0
mine experts say it could be the fastest way of punching through rock a hole that is wide enough to hoist the miners back to the surface			0
two other drills , a @entity167 ( @entity168 ) normally used for boring water holes and a @entity170 950 ( @entity171 ) normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines , have been operating for about three weeks			0
sunday was the first day that all three drills were working simultaneously , @entity8 said .			1
