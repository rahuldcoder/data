@entity0 -- groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants -- outraged over the @entity6 's decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins -- say they will ask the @entity6 to reconsider the policy			1
both groups say they learned about the policy change tuesday , and charged that the @entity6 is forgetting about the terrorist attacks that led to the formation of the agency			1
" it 's as if we did n't learn anything from 9/11 , " said @entity16 , head of the air marshal unit of the @entity18 ( @entity18 )			0
" flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks			2
" on tuesday , @entity6 administrator @entity24 announced that small pocketknives and an array of sporting equipment -- which were banned from aircraft cabins in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks -- will be allowed in @entity32 planes beginning april 25			1
former @entity6 chief backs ' knife ' decision ; suggests axes and machetes , too @entity38 will be allowed if the blade is no longer than 2.36 inches ( 6 centimeters ) , which is shorter than the 4 - inch blades that were allowed at the time of the 2001 attacks			1
and they must adhere to other rules : the blade can be no more than 1/2 inch at its widest point , it can not have a locking or fixed blade and can not have a molded grip			0
box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin			0
the @entity6 also will allow travelers to bring billiard cues , ski poles , hockey and lacrosse sticks and a maximum of two golf clubs into aircraft cabins as carry - on baggage			1
it will allow novelty and toy bats if they measure less than 24 inches and plastic bats if they weigh less than 24 ounces			0
some experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors , better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen - knives unnecessary			1
but @entity16 said he is " appalled " by the decision , and said air marshals are voicing their opposition to him			2
" i 've received probably over a hundred ( calls from air marshals )			2
" @entity18 president @entity81 said the dangers extend beyond air marshals			0
" @entity85 's decision is putting my guys at greater risk , " @entity81 said			2
" it 's not just the ( @entity92 ) , it 's all of my guys , " he said , noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights			1
a union representing 90,000 flight attendants called the measure " a poor and short - sighted decision by the @entity6			1
" " continued prohibition of these items is an integral layer in making our aviation system secure and must remain in place , " the @entity97 said in a statement			0
@entity24 said the @entity6 sought to distinguish small pocketknives , such as those equipped with corkscrews , from sturdier knives used primarily as weapons			1
screeners seize on average 47 of the smaller knives every day from @entity112 alone , he said tuesday			2
opinion : is @entity6 serious about letting people carry knives ? the new rule will allow screeners to focus on finding explosive device components and other things that can be " catastrophic " to a plane , speed trips through security checkpoints and " address the hassle factor , " @entity24 said			1
@entity24 said his agency consulted with its federal air marshals and other experts before making the change , and that led to the continued prohibition of the sturdier knifes with short blades			2
" experts in martial arts and close - quarters combat talked passionately about some of these smaller ( knives ) , even though they 're smaller than 6 centimeters			1
some of these knives are primarily weapons and do not serve the similar purpose as what you would call a small pocketknife			1
some are for hunters , for skinning ; some are simply for weapons			0
and so those will still remain on the prohibited items list , " @entity24 said			0
box cutters are prohibited regardless of blade length , he said			0
" i wish ( the new rule ) could be as clean as possible , " @entity24 said			0
but " there 's just too much emotion associated with particularly the box cutters , so those will not be allowed			0
" although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters in their attack , the weapons were not recovered , and investigators believe other types of knives were used			2
" our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time -- permissible utility knives or pocket knives , " a commission staff member said at a january 2004 hearing of the @entity162			2
a @entity172 knife was displayed during the hearing			0
the commission said its investigation found that " at least two knives like this were actually purchased by the hijackers and have not been found in the belongings the hijackers left behind			0
" immediately after the attacks , the @entity6 prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft cabins			1
but it has gradually been reintroducing some banned items such as cigarette lighters and matches			0
on occasion the @entity6 has expanded the list , as it did after a liquid bomb scare in august 2006 when it prohibited bringing large containers of liquids and gels on board aircraft			1
