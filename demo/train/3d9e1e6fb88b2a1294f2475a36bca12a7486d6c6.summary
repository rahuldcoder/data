@entity0 -- former @entity3 presidential nominee @entity2 warned wednesday that the @entity4 is losing the war in @entity6			1
sen. @entity2 recommended expanding the @entity8 army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops			2
the @entity11 senator , the ranking @entity3 on the @entity12 , said that while he approved of president @entity14 's recent decision to send 17,000 more troops to the country , he believed an additional allied military and civilian surge would be necessary to prevent it from once again becoming an @entity21 safe haven			2
the @entity14 administration is conducting a review of overall @entity4 policy in the troubled @entity26 republic , the president said in his joint address to @entity28 on tuesday			2
" with our friends and allies , we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for @entity6 and @entity33 to defeat @entity21 and combat extremism , " @entity14 said tuesday			2
" because i will not allow terrorists to plot against the @entity4 people from safe havens halfway around the world			0
we will not allow it			0
" but @entity2 said on wednesday , " when you are n't winning in this kind of war , you are losing			1
and , in @entity6 today , we are not winning			1
" he delivered his remarks at the @entity45 , a @entity0 - based think tank			0
@entity2 claimed that while the situation in @entity6 is " nowhere near as dire as it was in @entity50 , " the number of insurgent attacks had spiked in 2008 and violence had increased more than 500 percent in the past four years			1
growing portions of the country " suffer under the influence of the @entity53 , " he added			0
@entity2 's comments echoed those of defense secretary @entity58 , who acknowledged last friday that the @entity4 is facing a " very tough test " in @entity6			1
" but i 'm sure we will rise to the occasion the way we have many times before , " @entity58 told a news conference in @entity61 , @entity62 , where @entity64 defense ministers were meeting			0
@entity2 said that the @entity4 was winning the war in @entity6 through early 2005 , when some troops were withdrawn and " our integrated civil - military command structure was disassembled and replaced by a balkanized and dysfunctional arrangement			1
" a vietnam war veteran , former prisoner of war and longtime member of the @entity12 , @entity2 said that while he knows @entity4 " are weary of war ... we must win [ in @entity6 ]			1
the alternative is to risk that country 's return to its previous function as a terrorist sanctuary , from which @entity21 could train and plan attacks against @entity4			2
" among other things , @entity2 stated that the @entity4 needs to establish a larger military headquarters capable of executing " the necessary planning and coordination for a nationwide counterinsurgency campaign			1
" he also said plans to expand the @entity8 army from 68,000 to 134,000 troops were insufficient			0
he recommended expanding the @entity8 army to between 160,000 and 200,000 troops			0
at the same time , he said , the @entity4 needs to boost the country 's nonmilitary assistance to help strengthen " its [ civilian ] institutions , the rule of law , and the economy in order to provide a sustainable alternative to the drug trade			0

over the years , those two drugs have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency , including the @entity53			0
@entity2 warned that , even if his recommendations are adopted , the violence in @entity6 is " likely to get worse before it gets better			1
the scale of resources required to prevail will be enormous			1
" the timetable , he concluded , " will be measured in years , not months			0
