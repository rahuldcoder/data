-- the @entity2 's official history of the @entity4 war shows military chiefs made mistake after mistake in the early months of the conflict			1
@entity4 watch as a statue of @entity10 is toppled in @entity11 in 2003			2
failures to recognize the chaos engulfing the country and to send in enough troops to restore order after the 2003 invasion have long been highlighted by critics , but a new report shows the @entity2 assessing itself			1
@entity21 opinions from officers serving in the 18 months from the start of war to @entity4 elections in january 2005 reveal there were concerns at the time , not just about assumptions made by planners but at decisions taken once @entity33 - led coalition forces had control of @entity4			1
" i flipped , " gen. @entity35 , then the @entity2 's deputy chief of staff , told the historians of his reaction to a june 2003 decision to transfer control of all coalition troops away from the land forces command that had been preparing for the mission			1
he recounted a conversation with gen. @entity45 , who succeeded the invasion 's architect , gen. @entity46			0
" i said , ' @entity49 , @entity45 , this is a recipe for disaster			2
we invested in that headquarters			0
we have the experience and judgment in that headquarters			0
" @entity35 said it took the @entity33 command between six and eight months to get the new headquarters up and running			2
during that time , troops in the field saw the mood of ordinary @entity4 turn against @entity33 and watched the insurgency take root			1
" by the time we got a plan together to resource everything , the insurgents had closed that window of opportunity quickly , " col. @entity64 , a brigade commander in the @entity2 's @entity65 , told the historians			1
" what we started doing in september was probably a good idea to have done in april 2003			0
" franks , who would soon retire and be awarded the @entity76 , said he ordered the transition to force the @entity79 to get leaders into the field to work with civilian occupation officials			0
" that is a task that @entity45 and i very simply laid on @entity85 and said , ' figure it out			0
get me a joint headquarters in here			0
we have a lot of work to do and [ civilian administrator of @entity4 ] @entity94 has a lot of responsibility and he needs help , ' " he recalled			0
the 720 - page report compiled by the @entity99 at @entity100 , @entity101 , details the effects of having too few coalition troops on the ground when the reality after the fall of @entity11 was " severely out of line " with the anticipated conditions			1
previous experience " should have indicated that many more troops would be needed for the @entity113 era in @entity4 , " historians wrote in the report , " @entity115 : transition to a @entity117			0
" " the coalition 's inability to prevent looting , to secure @entity4 's borders and to guard the vast number of munitions dumps in the early months after @entity10 's overthrow are indicative of the shortage , " the study found			1
about 150,000 @entity33 and allied troops were in @entity4 after the invasion , at a time when war planners were assuming that @entity4 's government would remain functional after @entity10 's ouster and that there would be no mass insurgency			1
" these factors were in line with prewar planning for a quick turnover of power to @entity4 and a quick withdrawal of @entity33 forces , leaving @entity4 to determine their own political future -- options that proved impossible to execute , " the historians wrote in the report released over the weekend			2
" we had the wrong assumptions , and therefore , we had the wrong plan to put into play , " gen. @entity146 , who commanded the @entity2 's @entity147 during the invasion , told the authors			2
but some of the most critical decisions were made between may and august 2003 , which some participants called a " window of opportunity that could have been exploited to produce the conditions for the quick creation of a new @entity4			0
" among those decisions were the frequently criticized dissolution of the @entity4 army and the order that barred former members of @entity10 's @entity163 from public life as well as the change in plan over the joint headquarters .			1

@entity2 history of @entity170 's first two years says @entity33 was *unprepared* for chaos
@entity33 - led coalition did *n't* have enough troops after @entity10 's fall , report says
" this is a recipe for disaster , " one general recalls saying of one decision
