-- there is a simple message for @entity3 one year on from his devastating accident -- keep fighting			1
@entity6 's record - breaking , seven - time world champion is continuing his recovery from the severe head injuries he sustained in a skiing crash on 29th december last year			1
after emergency brain surgery in @entity12 and nine months in hospital , @entity3 has been moved to the family home near @entity15 in @entity16 to continue his rehabilitation			1
his close family , including his wife @entity19 and two teenage children @entity20 and @entity22 , have maintained their silent support by choosing not to release a statement on the anniversary of the accident			0
@entity3 's son @entity22 , who is beginning his own racing career in go - karts , had been among the skiing party when the @entity6 star fell and hit his head on a rock at the @entity35 resort of @entity36			1
there were expressions of support for @entity3 , however , from the @entity42 racer 's global fans and members of the @entity6 community , monday			1
" it has been one year already ... " wrote @entity46 driver @entity45 on @entity47			0
" @entity48 our thoughts are still with you and your family			0
" @entity54 driver @entity53 also marked the occasion : " @entity56 -- i know you will			0
" the @entity58 team , who @entity3 drove for between 2010 and 2012 , said : " one year on , our thoughts remain with @entity3 , his family and friends every day			2

the @entity42 , winner of a record 91 grand prix , was known as fearless racer who gave no quarter on track			2
fans of " @entity3 " expect him to continue his fight against his injuries with the same inner steel and determination			2
the difficulty with complex head injuries is that there is no predictable prognosis or timeline for recovery			1
" if you look at severe head injury victims who go on to make a good recovery -- and i 'm not saying all do -- it will always be a story of years , " @entity106 , a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport told @entity0 in june			1

the latest statement , issued in september , read : " considering the severe injuries he suffered , progress has been made in the past weeks and months			0
there is still , however , a long and difficult road ahead			0
" we ask that the privacy of @entity3 's family continue to be respected , and that speculations about his state of health are avoided			2
" @entity147 confirmed to @entity0 that there was no further update on his medical condition at this time			0
@entity3 , who won the @entity151 with @entity152 in 1994 and 1995 before a period of dominance with @entity155 between 2000 and 2004 , will turn 46 on 3rd january			0
while @entity3 had retired from the sport in 2012 , after a second spell with @entity58 , his accident on the ski slopes still sent shockwaves through @entity6			1
but the global sport 's close - knit traveling community had to cushion more devastating news in october when @entity163 crashed in the late stages of the @entity166 @entity165			1
the @entity35 racer , driving for the now defunct @entity169 team , was left with severe head injuries when his car skidded off track in wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle			1

" he is breathing unaided and his vital signs are stable , but his condition is still classified as ' critical '			0
" @entity163 , a popular figure on the current @entity6 grid , is also being remembered during the festive period			1
