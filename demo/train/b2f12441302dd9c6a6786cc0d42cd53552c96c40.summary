if it had happened anywhere else , this would be the world 's biggest story			1
more than 230 girls disappeared , captured by members of a brutal terrorist group in the dead of night			1
their parents are desperate and anguished , angry that their government is not doing enough			1
the rest of the world is paying little attention			2
the tragedy is unfolding in @entity14 , where members of the ultra-radical @entity17 group @entity16 grabbed the girls , most believed to be between 16 and 18 , from their dormitories in the middle of the night in mid-april and took them deep into the jungle			1
a few dozen of the students managed to escape and tell their story			2
( roughly 200 girls remain missing			1
) the latest reports from people living in the forest say @entity16 fighters are sharing the girls , conducting mass marriages , selling them each for $ 12			1
one community elder explained the practice as " a medieval kind of slavery			0
" while much of the world has been consumed with other stories , notably the missing @entity40 plane , the relatives of the kidnapped girls in the small town of @entity44 in northeastern @entity14 have struggled for weeks with no resources to help them			1
the @entity14 government allayed international concerns when it reported -- incorrectly -- that it had rescued most of the girls			1
but the girls were still in captivity			2
their parents raised money to arrange private expeditions into the jungle			2
they found villagers who had seen the hostages with heavily armed men			0
relatives are holding street protests to demand more help from the government			0
with a social media push , including a @entity67 # @entity66 campaign , they are seeking help anywhere they can find it			0
@entity14 demand government do more to save abducted girls it 's hard to imagine a more compelling , dramatic , heartbreaking story			1
and this is not a one - off event			0
this tragedy is driven by forces that will grow stronger and deadlier if the captors manage to succeed			0
i think of these girls as trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building			2
their mothers and fathers try to dig them out with their bare hands , while the men who brought down the building vow to blow up others			0
everyone else walks by , with barely a second glance			0
perhaps this story sounds remote			2
but at its heart it is a version of the same conflict that drives the fighting in other parts of the world			2
these young girls , eager for an education , are caught in the crossfire of the war between @entity102 radicalism and modernity			1
it 's the @entity14 version of the same dispute that brought 9/11 to the @entity106 ; that brought killings to @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity112 cities ; the same ideological battle that destroyed the lives of millions of people in @entity116 ; that drives many of the fighters in @entity119 and elsewhere			1
in @entity14 , the dispute includes uniquely local factors , but the objectives of @entity16 sound eerily familiar			1
@entity16 wants to impose its strict interpretation of @entity123 -- islamic law			1
it operates mostly in the northern part of @entity14 , a country divided between a @entity127 - majority north and a @entity128 - majority south			0
@entity102 rule is its larger objective , but its top priority , judging from the group 's name , explains why it has gone after girls going to school			1
@entity16 , in the local @entity137 language , means roughly " @entity139 education is sin			1
" but women are just the beginning , and @entity16 goes about its goals not only by kidnapping , but also by slaughtering men and women of all ages and of any religion			1
these militants view a modern education as an affront , no matter who receives it			2
in february , they burst into a student dormitory in the northern state of @entity156 , where teenage boys were sleeping after a day of classes			0
they killed about 30 boys , shooting some , hacking others in their beds , slitting the throats of the ones trying to flee			0
in july , also in @entity156 , they shot 20 students and their teacher			0
the gruesome attacks are not restricted to remote areas			0
a few weeks ago , a bus bombing in the capital of @entity171 killed more than 75 people			2
it was the deadliest terrorist act in the city 's history			2
@entity16 has killed thousands of people since 2009 and has caused a humanitarian crisis with a " devastating impact , " causing nearly 300,000 to flee their homes , according to @entity182			1
@entity14 is a resource - rich nation whose people live in grinding poverty			0
it is also plagued with endemic corruption			0
that triple combination -- poverty , corruption and resource - wealth -- creates fertile ground for strife and extremism			0
and the instability in @entity14 sends tremors through a fragile region			0
@entity16 keeps hideouts and bases along the border with neighboring countries @entity201 and @entity202			1
this is an international crisis that requires international help			0
is there anything anyone can do ? most definitely			0
first , it is urgent that the plight of these girls and their families gain the prominence it so clearly deserves			0
global attention will lead to offers for help , to press for action			0
just as the intense focus on the missing @entity40 plane and the lost @entity222 ferry prompted other nations to extend a hand , a focus on this ongoing tragedy would have the same effect			0
@entity14 's government , with a decidedly mixed record on its response to @entity16 , will find it difficult to look away if world leaders offer assistance in finding and rescuing the kidnapped girls from @entity44 , and another 25 girls also kidnapped by @entity16 in the town of @entity235 a few weeks earlier			1
this is an important story , a wrenching human drama , even if it happened in a part of the world where news coverage is very difficult compared with places such as @entity40 , @entity222 or @entity242			1
the plight of the @entity14 girls should remain in our thoughts , at the forefront of news coverage and on the agenda of world leaders .			1

@entity251 : if more than 200 girls were kidnapped elsewhere , it would be world 's biggest story
@entity257 : parents desperate , anguished with no resources to help , while world turns away
@entity257 : @entity16 slaughtered thousands of people , many in schools , to stamp out education
coverage led to international effort for @entity269 , she says , and we need effort to save girls
