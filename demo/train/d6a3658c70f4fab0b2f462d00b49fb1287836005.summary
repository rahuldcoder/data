-- deep red roses , waxy white lilies and bright , cheery sunflowers ; as single blooms and in large bouquets , they pile up close to desk 29 at @entity7 's @entity7			1
twenty - four hours ago this was where @entity11 ' @entity10 passengers checked in before boarding their ill - fated plane ; bound for @entity14 , their journey would end far too soon , in a @entity17 field close to the border with @entity19			1
on thursday , @entity20 was chatting to many of those fliers			0
a customs officer at the airport , she helped them claim back their vat ( sales tax ) before leaving the country			2
a day later , a crying @entity29 was among those leaving floral tributes to the dead , still stunned by the tragedy that had unfolded			1
" we saw a lot of the people that are on the plane and it 's just really weird to me to imagine that they are gone , " she explained tearfully			1
like @entity29 , many of the others bringing flowers had little connection to those on the plane			2
here to catch flights of their own , they dash inside , stopping at the airport florist -- more used to creating " welcome home " bouquets than funereal arrangements -- before walking back out onto the sidewalk to lay their offerings on the concrete			0
outside the terminal , there are plenty of signs that this is no ordinary day at @entity7 , one of the world 's busiest airports : the growing pile of flowers , the condolence book rapidly filling with messages of grief and support and , across the road , past the lines of cars pulling up to drop travelers off , huge numbers of film crews from across the world			1
but step inside the building , and it is business as usual : passengers looking forward to long - awaited holidays or arriving in the city for business meetings wheel suitcases across the concourse , shops and cafes are busy , and flights take off and land as usual			1
this extreme normality caused difficulties for at least one man , distressed and desperate to find out what had happened to his business partner , who he feared was on @entity10 , and who was not answering his increasingly frantic calls			2
with no signs offering advice to those trying to check up on possible passengers , he was left wandering the airport , shuttling from one information desk to another , clutching one mobile phone to his ear and another in his hand as he tried to reach someone , anyone , who could tell him if his friend was on board			2
sadly , there was to be no good news ; after one call , crying " i knew it , i knew he was on the plane ! " he hurried away			2
many of the relatives of those on the plane are being cared for at a local hotel while they work out what to do next			0
the airline has offered them $ 5,000 compensation to cover their immediate expenses , and has said it will try and find a way of getting them to the crash site if they want to see it			0
it says visiting the site where a plane came down has proved helpful to relatives in some previous cases , but the location of @entity10 's final resting place -- in the middle of a conflict zone -- makes this problematic , to say the least			1
as the arguments and investigations over what brought down the plane go on , elsewhere in the @entity139 , other makeshift shrines are popping up			0
in the @entity146 fishing village of @entity147 , bouquets have been laid outside a flower shop owned by @entity149 , who is believed to have been on the downed plane			0
@entity149 's boyfriend , @entity151 , apparently posted a jokey picture of the @entity11 plane on @entity154 shortly before take - off : " in case it goes missing , this is what the plane looks like			1
" on friday , stunned customers and friends stopped by to sign a book of condolence and pay tribute to the florist ; one weeping woman , a regular visitor to the store , said @entity149 was " a very nice girl " who would be sadly missed			0
as word spreads of those caught up in the tragedy , the number of mourners is only likely to increase in the coming days			0
@entity172 17 full coverage @entity0 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
