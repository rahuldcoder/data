-- i have a confession to make			0
in the 2005 @entity3 , i did not finish in 3 hours , 11 minutes			0
that 's the time i 've reported to those who 've asked about my @entity6 ( @entity6 ) and it is , quite frankly , wrong			1
i actually ran a 3:12			0
these days , with those little plastic chips attached to sneakers ( they record a runner 's time from the moment he crosses the starting line to the finish line -- not merely from the moment the gun goes off ) , there 's a difference between one 's stated time and his official time			1
i was always under the impression that 3:11 was my official time			1
then -- oops -- last night i checked			0
it was , i confess once again , 3:12			0
shame , thy name is @entity26			1
this is a long - winded way of saying that @entity28 and i have something in common			1
he , like @entity30 , exaggerated his marathon pr as well , recently boasting to conservative talk - radio host @entity33 of a " two hour and 50 - something " clocking over 26.2 miles			1
when i first heard of the blunder from the @entity38 vice-presidential candidate , i empathized			0
hey , maybe " two hour and 50 - something " was actually 3:02			0
i mean , memories get foggy , chips malfunction , the cranial lobes shut down after such a strenuous endeavor			0
news : @entity28 walks back exaggerated marathon time then , ahem , the good folks at @entity47 did a little digging and , eh , ahem , uh -- well , @entity28 's time was , ahem , eh , uh -- 4:01:25			1
in the congressman 's defense , the race occurred 22 years back , in the @entity55 - based @entity54			0
that 's a long time ago			1
and yet -- no. no , no , no , no , no. there is no possible explanation for a four - hour marathoner claming he 's a three - hour marathoner			0
having been a runner for the last 32 years , and having competed for a season of track and cross country at the @entity67 ( i was arguably one of the nation 's worst 100 @entity70 runners ) , and having completed 11 marathons , i can tell you -- with 100 % certainty -- that when @entity28 says ( more or less ) , " oops , simple mistake , " he is full of it			1
for those of you who do n't run , a 4:01 marathoner insisting he broke three hours is the equivalent of a .220 hitter speaking of a .310 average			1
it 's a retired small - town mayor looking back at his time as a @entity85 senator ; a dive - bar rock band bragging of once opening for @entity87 at @entity88			2
in this world of ours , there are exaggerations ( " she looked just like @entity95 ! " ) , there are boasts ( " @entity96 , gim me a week in the pool and i 'll destroy @entity98 ! " ) and there are flat - out , straight - up , no - holds - barred lies			0
this is a flat - out , straight - up , no - holds - barred lie			0
of course , in and of itself , perhaps @entity28 's fib is n't such a big deal			1
the world is filled with once - upon - a - time jocks recalling glory that , truth be told , was n't all that glorious			2
( is n't this what high school reunions are made for ? ) but when it comes to @entity114 's favorite son , a lie -- in this case about a marathon time -- is n't such an isolated occurrence			1
in case you missed the @entity38 convention , @entity28 's speech was an unambiguous ode to mistruth			1
among other dandies , he ripped the president for ignoring the @entity127 recommendations -- even though @entity28 voted against its final report ; claimed the @entity85 people were " cut out " of stimulus spending when , actually , more than a quarter of all stimulus dollars went for tax relief for workers			2
on and on and on and on			0
here 's the strangest thing of all : a 4:01:25 marathon is no joke			2
ok , @entity28 was never going to be the next @entity140 or @entity141			2
but there 's something to be said for the mediocre jock who trains his butt off , loads up on energy gel and fights his way through 26.2 miles			1
just as easily as lying , the man could have talked about fighting through the wall at 18 miles ; about seeing his family cheer him on from the side of the road ; about crossing the finish line and feeling downright ( hey ! ) reaganesque in the moment			0
truth be told , there 's no shame in being average			2
there 's only shame in refusing to accept it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity26 .			2

@entity26 says one 's official marathon record is not something a runner takes *lightly*
so @entity28 claiming to have run 26.2 miles in under three hours seemed amazing , he says
his time was really 4:01 . @entity28 says he forgot ; @entity26 says this is bogus and a @entity28 pattern
@entity26 : @entity28 getting known for *distorting* truth , even about his respectable marathon time
