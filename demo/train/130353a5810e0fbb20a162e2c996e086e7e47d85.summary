-- the @entity4 gunman had " connections " to jihadists in @entity7 who shared a radical @entity9 ideology , including at least one who went overseas to fight in @entity11 , multiple @entity2 sources told @entity0 on thursday			1
however , @entity7 foreign minister @entity12 told @entity0 's @entity13 that there is " no evidence at this stage " that @entity17 was linked to a wider group , or network , of jihadists			1
" there 's no evidence at this stage for us to know that			1
obviously there 's an investigation going on , and we hope to learn more in the ... coming days			1
it was clear that , police authorities now have announced , that he was acting alone yesterday , " he said			1
according to two @entity2 counterterrorism officials , @entity17 was connected to @entity33 through social media			2
@entity33 is wanted by @entity7 authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside @entity9 fighters in @entity11 , @entity37 , a @entity7 newspaper , reported			1
the sources said the two communicated via social media and the @entity41 , but it does not appear they were close			2
early indications are that @entity17 's connections to other extremists were " interactions " online , including extremist sites , a different @entity2 source said			1
the activity was " attenuated , " or limited , the source said , noting it appears , so far , that @entity17 had a low profile			1
there is no evidence so far that he had any " operational links " to other jihadists , according to the source , who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack			1
@entity2 officials are reportedly scouring databases and communications for possible links to @entity2 - based jihadists			1
other radicalized people connected to @entity17 are still believed to be living in @entity7 , @entity2 law enforcement officials said			2
" the investigation is ongoing and will rapidly determine if @entity17 received any support in the planning of his attack , " @entity66 commissioner @entity65 told reporters thursday			2
officials now have " information that suggests an association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views , " he said			2
@entity65 did n't say who these people are or how @entity17 may have interacted with them			2
the gunman authorities are still in the early stages of their investigation , but they are beginning to piece together the puzzle			1
they released surveillance video thursday that shows events on wednesday			2
in the footage , a vehicle pulls up near @entity89 , and a man exits , running with a large gun as people run from him			2
in other footage , this same man then gets into another vehicle , drives to a nearby building , gets out and runs armed into the building pursued by law enforcement			2
@entity12 , in a thursday night interview with @entity101 on @entity0 , described the chaos inside the building , saying @entity17 " ran right by the room where the entire government caucus was			2
we could hear the ringing out of rifle fire and then the huge amount of semiautomatic noise			2
" we did n't know if the door would be banged open and that we 'd all be sprayed , " he said			2
@entity12 said the sergeant - at - arms of the @entity114 shot and killed @entity17 at the door to the library , which contained a tourist group as well as employees			2
" you could have seen more than a dozen killed if he ( the sergeant - at - arms ) had n't taken such quick action , " @entity12 said			2
@entity17 was a @entity7 citizen who may have had dual @entity124 - @entity7 citizenship , said @entity65			2
the police commissioner said @entity17 was born in @entity126 and lived in @entity127 and most recently @entity128			1
@entity17 had been in the @entity7 capital since at least october 2 " to deal with a passport issue and ... he was also hoping to leave for @entity11 , " @entity65 said			1
@entity65 also said of @entity17 : " according to some accounts , he was an individual who may have held extremist beliefs			2
" @entity17 was applying for a passport -- an application that was under investigation -- at the time of the attack , but had not had his passport revoked , as has been previously reported , @entity65 said			1
" i think the passport figured prominently in his motives , " said the police commissioner			1
" however , we have not come to ground completely on his motivations for this attack			0
but clearly , it 's linked to his radicalization			1
clearly , it 's linked to his difficult circumstances			1
" according to @entity65 , investigators thus far have not found any connection between @entity17 and @entity152 -- who authorities say ran down and killed a @entity7 soldier in @entity156 on monday			0
who was @entity4 shooter @entity160 ? @entity17 was born as @entity162 in 1982			1

" the gunman 's mother , @entity172 , spoke to @entity174 by phone			1
she struggled to hold back tears and said she did n't know what to say to those hurt in the attack			0
" if i 'm crying , it 's for the people , " @entity17 reportedly said			1
" not for my son			0
" " i 'm mad at my son , " she said in a separate email to the @entity174 @entity185 : " we will not run scared ' @entity7 lawmakers returned to work thursday , giving a standing ovation to the ceremonial @entity89 official credited with taking down the gunman who killed a soldier and shook the @entity89 area			1
" we 'll be vigilant , but we will not run scared			0
we will be prudent , but we will not panic			0
and as for the business of government , well , here we are -- in our seats , in our chamber , in the very heart of our democracy , " @entity7 prime minister @entity185 told the @entity114 in @entity4			0
lawmakers stood and cheered sergeant - at - arms @entity200 , who officials say took down the suspect in the halls of @entity89 minutes after the killing of @entity7 army reservist cpl. @entity205 at a war memorial nearby			0
@entity200 , who regularly leads a procession into the @entity114 as sessions begin , stood with his ceremonial mace and appeared to be emotional during the ovation			0
he later released a statement saying he is touched by the attention			0
" however , i have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of members , employees and visitors to @entity219 , " @entity200 said			0
it was a step toward normalcy for a government district that was widely locked down for hours after the shootings at @entity7 's @entity224 and @entity225			1
authorities say @entity17 shot and killed @entity205 , who was standing guard at the war memorial on wednesday morning			0
the gunman then entered the nearby main @entity89 building in downtown @entity4 , where witnesses say shots were fired -- many by security officers -- before he was shot dead			1
a plainclothes constable who was working security at @entity89 was shot in the leg , according to a @entity114 official briefed on the investigation			0
the injury is not life - threatening , and the constable was treated at a hospital and released , the official said on condition of anonymity			0
the shootings left government workers and others locked inside offices for a large portion of the day while police searched buildings to ensure that no other culprit was loose			1
wednesday 's deadly attack was the second on @entity7 soldiers this week			1

i do n't know how someone could have picked him out and just did that			0
" before @entity89 reopened , lawmakers gathered outside the memorial -- some holding flowers -- for a moment of silence for @entity205			0
" this was very off the cuff , " lawmaker @entity305 told @entity0 on thursday morning			0
" i think parliamentarians really just felt that before we walked into the @entity89 buildings , we had to pay respect to a young man who gave his life for his country			0
" @entity305 said the soldiers ' killings this week left the government with plenty of questions			0
" the questions we need to ask ourselves ( include ) , ' how are these people getting this crazy ideology that 's inspiring them to do these copycat killings ? ' " he said			1
another question , he said : what can society do to deal with people who find themselves on the fringes ? issues of mental health , he said , need to be addressed			0
