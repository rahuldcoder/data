-- @entity1 will not pursue a lawsuit against a @entity4 tv station for allegedly damaging the company 's image by reporting erroneous and offensive names of the pilots in the recent crash at @entity10			2
the company said wednesday it would n't file a suit after @entity13 offered an official apology			1
the bogus names , which phonetically spelled out phrases such as " @entity17 " and " @entity18 , " were read during @entity13 's noon broadcast friday			1
the airline called the report " demeaning " and said it was " reviewing possible legal action			1
" the @entity23 fell short of its approach and crashed on the runway at the airport on july 6			2
three people were killed and more than 180 others were hurt			0
the early stage of the investigation has focused heavily on the actions of the crew during the landing attempt			0
@entity1 jokes : racist or just bad taste ? over the weekend , the @entity38 airline had said it would sue the @entity29 and the station after an intern at the @entity29 mistakenly confirmed " inaccurate and offensive " names as those of the pilots			1
but at the beginning of the week , the airline seemed to have a change of heart			2
a spokesman said the company did n't have plans to file a separate suit against the @entity29			0
the agency apologized for the " inaccurate and offensive " names , which it said were erroneously confirmed by a summer intern			0

as for @entity13 , in @entity59 , anchor @entity58 read the names friday			1
the news station , a @entity0 affiliate , later apologized on air and on its website			1
but the airline continued to move ahead with a defamation claim against the tv station until the wednesday announcement			1
@entity69 , president of the @entity70 and the dean of the @entity72 at @entity73 , said " it 's very difficult to conceive of a defamation suit prevailing here			1
" the key to such a case is to determine whether what was said damages an entity 's reputation and causes injury , and what care was taken , if any , to prevent that , he told @entity0			0
passengers begin legal action against @entity87 " everyone who heard this understood it was a prank			0
and as ludicrous as the report was , at least the news station made a call to try to check , " he said			1
@entity69 notes that the real names of pilots were not given in the news report			1
" where is the real damage ? yes , it was tasteless and undoubtedly it caused some short - term emotional distress , but nothing that rises to the level of litigation , " he said			0
it was not immediately clear who produced the fake names , but the @entity29 said it was not the intern			0
" the names were presented , by the station , to the intern for confirmation , " @entity29 spokeswoman @entity111 said			2
" the intern did not make up the names and provide them to the station			2
" the @entity29 said it does not release or confirm the identities of crew members or other people involved in transportation accidents .			0

@entity13 is a local station based in @entity59 , @entity124
