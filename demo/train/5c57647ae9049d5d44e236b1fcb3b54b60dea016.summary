@entity0 -- the @entity2 faces questions over whether it prematurely ended interrogation of @entity6 bombing suspect @entity5 before a court appearance at his hospital bed			1
@entity11 chairman @entity10 said he was " concerned that these proceedings , which included mandatory administration of @entity15 rights , could have been conducted in a manner that prematurely cut off a lawful , ongoing @entity18 interview			1
" @entity5 faced a judicial " first appearance " on monday at @entity24 three days after being taken into custody for the april 15 bombing that killed three people and injured more than 260 others			1
a government source familiar with the first appearance says the @entity15 warning , which advises criminal suspects of their constitutional rights against self - incrimination , were first administered while a magistrate judge presided over the hearing			1
government officials indicated @entity35 , 19 , was not immediately apprised of those rights after his capture late last friday , under what is called the " public safety " exception			0
that allows for limited questioning by law enforcement of a suspect to determine if there as imminent danger to the public of attack			1
the weekend interrogation period from saturday evening into monday morning was 16 hours , but questioning was off and on because of suspect 's medical condition , according to the government source			1
@entity54 , who sustained a gunshot wound , reportedly gave investigators specific information about the marathon bombing			2
was @entity60 next target ? two sources tell @entity1 he has since not answered " substantive " questions from investigators about his alleged operational role in the attack			2
authorities allege @entity5 bombed the famed road race along with his brother , @entity69 , 26 , who died early friday morning following a violent confrontation with police			1
there were indications that @entity5 was offering more basic personal information not related to the investigation -- such as his family and work history			1
but @entity10 , a @entity79 @entity78 , told @entity1 the cooperation has stopped			2
" once they walked into the hospital room and offered the lawyer and @entity88 , the subject has not continued to cooperate with authorities and that 's a huge problem , " said @entity10 in an interview that aired thursday on @entity1 's " @entity82 with @entity83			2
" @entity5 only began " responding " to government law enforcement investigators saturday evening under the " public safety exception " allowing interrogation without @entity15 rights			1
suspects ' mother expresses doubts about bombing formal charges were filed under seal on sunday , but the questioning continued			2
@entity5 faces one count of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction , namely an improvised explosive device , against persons and property within the @entity107 resulting in death			2
he also was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death			0
the @entity2 must decide whether to seek the death penalty			0
one government source said the court and federal public defenders were notified of the charges and it was arranged for the judge , defenders , and prosecutors to meet the next morning to have the court appearance in the hospital room			1
the @entity107 attorney 's office coordinated with the hospital staff when the suspect would be available , since he had earlier been under sedation			2
a spokeswoman for that office , @entity132 , said judge @entity133 followed legal protocol and scheduled a hearing " without unnecessary delay " as the law requires			2
it is unusual but not unprecedented for a judge to preside at bedside for an injured defendant			0
@entity132 stressed the judge is obligated to set a hearing as soon as the criminal complaint is filed because the accused is entitled to an initial appearance and to be provided legal counsel , which @entity5 received			1
sources dismissed earlier media reports the judge had " barged " into an ongoing @entity18 interrogation , and that the team of interrogators were caught off guard by the court proceeding about to take place			0
a source said the interrogation had wrapped up about an hour before the court session began , and that all parties were advised of the mandatory court appearance			1
there was no reaction from the court or @entity133 's chambers			0
the @entity2 said it would look into @entity10 ' concerns			0
@entity10 said the @entity18 may have been too quick to end the questioning , and criticized the judge 's actions			0
" that is highly unusual for a judge to intervene so hastily and make the decision not based on the facts of the interviews and the public safety exception , but what they perceived was happening based on what they saw on television , " he said			0
" it 's a dangerous precedence setting that i think we need to change and correct right away			0
and we still need more answers on this particular question			0
" @entity2 spokesman @entity184 also confirmed the @entity107 attorney 's sequence of events			0
" following the filing of the criminal complaint in this matter on sunday , the court , that evening , scheduled an initial appearance for monday , which it then coordinated with the prosecutors , federal defender , court reporter , @entity197 and the hospital			1
" @entity199 require the @entity200 to advise the defendant of his right to silence and his right to counsel during the @entity205			0
the prosecutors and @entity18 agents in @entity209 were advised of the scheduled initial appearance in advance of its occurrence , " @entity184 said in a statement			0
generally , suspects charged with crimes in an initial criminal complaint are to be brought before court within " one business day , " even those hospitalized like @entity5			1
the public safety exception does not set a hard time when questioning must stop and the suspect must be taken into court , but it 's generally understood to be about 48 hours			1
the government would have to justify holding anyone longer than that under the exception			0
the court case is @entity107 v. @entity5 ( 13 - 2106 )			1
@entity1 's @entity230 , @entity231 , and @entity232 contributed to this report .			0
