when @entity2 's state - owned oil company dispatched an oil rig to a contested area of the @entity5 it flicked a match on a long - smoldering dispute with its communist neighbor @entity9			1
analysts say @entity11 must have known the move would elicit some reaction , but it clearly did n't predict having to evacuate thousands of @entity2 nationals desperate to put some distance between them and violent @entity17 protests			1
" the whole episode seems to reek of miscalculation , perhaps by both sides , but it demonstrates how volatile how this region can be , " said @entity18 , @entity19 at the @entity20 , @entity21 ( @entity20 )			0
at issue is the positioning of an oil rig in waters claimed by both @entity2 and @entity9			1
@entity9 claims the rig 's presence is " illegal " while @entity2 says it has every right to drill , and has castigated the @entity17 government for failing to ensure the safety of its nationals			1
to understand the issue , it 's vital to look at the exact position of the rig			0
where is the rig ? in early may , @entity11 announced the hd - 981 rig would be parked at sea for exploratory work until mid-august			0
owned by the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) , the rig is anchored in @entity46 , about 120 nautical miles east of @entity9 's @entity47 and 180 nautical miles from @entity2 's @entity48 , according to the @entity49 ( @entity49 )			1
analysis co-authored by @entity49 experts said @entity2 's @entity52 appears to be basing its right to be there on the assumption that one of the @entity57 , which it claims as its own , is 17 miles north , allowing it to claim its own continental shelf in the region			1
@entity2 calls the contested @entity57 the @entity57 , while in @entity9 they 're known as the @entity57			2
@entity9 says the rig site is clearly on its continental shelf , and moreover is in its @entity63			1
@entity64 has demanded that @entity2 remove the offending rig , escort vessels from the region and hold talks to settle the issue			2
the @entity2 rig was escorted to the region by naval vessels and fighter jets , drawing @entity17 boats to the area and raising tensions at sea			1
the @entity17 have accused @entity2 vessels of ramming and blasting its boats with water cannon			0
the @entity2 say any conflict was provoked by @entity17 harassment			0
clashes on land @entity87 away from the standoff at sea , violent protests have erupted at @entity2 and @entity91 owned or operated factories , mainly in the provinces of @entity93 and @entity94			2
protesters smashed down gates and set fire to businesses , attacking anything deemed to be of @entity2 origin , including its nationals			2
on sunday , @entity2 chartered flights to evacuate 290 citizens , including 100 injured in the most recent violence			0
video aired by state broadcaster @entity105 showed some limping or being carried down the stairs of a medical flight arriving in the city of @entity111 , many with limbs bandaged			0
two @entity2 nationals were killed in earlier clashes , authorities said			2
around 7,000 @entity2 nationals had boarded ships or were due to do so this week , state news agency @entity118 reported			1
an outraged opinion piece published on the same site said the protests by " irrational rioters " would in no way strengthen @entity64 's " groundless claim over @entity2 territory and surrounding waters in the @entity5			1
" who is right ? while many commentators say @entity9 has every right to feel appalled over the positioning of the @entity2 rig , at least one analyst says the issue not as clear cut as some suggest			1
" geographical proximity alone is not an unequivocal basis for claiming sovereignty or sovereign rights , " writes @entity136 in the @entity137			0
@entity136 , a senior fellow at the @entity142 ( @entity143 ) at @entity144 , says @entity9 's claim to the @entity57 is " seriously weakened " by @entity9 's recognition of @entity2 's sovereignty over the @entity57 and lack of protest between 1958 and 1975			1
in 1974 , the two countries fought the @entity151 , which ended in a @entity2 victory and complete control over the land and surrounding waters			0
after the reunification of @entity9 in 1975 , @entity9 's leaders publicly renewed the country 's claim to the islands but the issue remains unresolved			2
in january this year , activists shouted anti-china slogans and laid flowers for more than 70 @entity17 soldiers killed in the conflict , 40 years on			0
what is motivating @entity2 ? on the surface , oil would seem to be the reason @entity2 has waded into the disputed area but analysts say politics are clearly at play			2
" this kind of a move by putting an oil rig in this sort of place , you could say it 's a carte blanche to allow @entity2 to enhance its naval operations in the region and to project its power further out into the @entity5 , " @entity18 said			1
it 's not the first time @entity2 has stepped on regional sensitivities by making high profile and deliberate incursions into contested tracts			2
there have been tense encounters between @entity192 and @entity2 over the @entity193 or @entity193 in recent years , and @entity2 has locked horns with the @entity195 over competing claims to the @entity197			0
in a statement released may 7 , the @entity198 characterized @entity2 's latest move as a " part of a broader pattern of @entity2 behavior to advance its claims over disputed territory in a manner that undermines peace and stability in the region			1
" what 's the response from @entity2 ? the ferocity of the @entity17 protests appears to have taken @entity2 by surprise and it 's clearly expressed its dissatisfaction with @entity9 's handling of the unrest			1
on may 18 , @entity2 announced it was suspending some of its plans for bilateral exchanges with the country			0
it 's warned its citizens that @entity9 is not safe for travel , while the @entity223 reported many @entity2 travel agencies had suspended tours to @entity9			1
@entity2 has also warned of other unspecified punishment , hinting that it will use its economic leverage			0
trade between @entity2 and @entity9 reached more than 50 billion dollars in 2013 according to @entity2 state media and @entity9 depends heavily on foreign investment			1
commentary carried by @entity2 's state - run @entity118 news agency suggested : " it is advisable for the @entity17 government to think of the bigger picture and not to get stuck in extreme nationalism so as to avoid escalation of violence and complication of the situation in the @entity5			1
" by immediately stopping the violence and any further provocations , @entity9 can work with @entity2 to tap the full potential of their economic cooperation in such areas as financial services and industry transfer			2
" how has @entity9 responded ? while maintaining its demands for @entity2 to leave the contested area , the @entity17 government says it 's taken steps to dampen further protests			1
it has characterized the protests as " spontaneous acts " by individuals who are exploiting the situation to " cause social disorder			0
" hundreds of people have been arrested and the government has reassured foreign investors that it attaches a " special importance " to ensuring their safety			0
how is this likely to end ? @entity18 from @entity20 predicts relations between the two will be strained for some time , but trade ties between the countries are likely to offer a way forward			0
" i think there 's a common misperception that the party - to - party relationship , the two communist parties in @entity2 and @entity9 , have this deep and understanding relationship			2
i do n't think that 's necessarily true			0
i think to a large extent this relationship is cosmetic , " he said			0
" the real business of the relationship is in trade so that might be an area where there could be a way out , or channels of communication could speak more than political acrimony			0
" the @entity17 authorities ca n't afford to lose very significant chunks of investment into their economy			0
