@entity0 -- yet another @entity3 family member is weighing in on whether or not former @entity4 gov. @entity3 will run for president in 2016			1
" i think it 's more than likely that he 's giving this a serious thought in moving forward , " his eldest son , @entity6 , told @entity7 on sunday			1
" if you had asked me a few years back , i would 've said it was less likely , " said @entity3 , who himself is running for political office for the first time as @entity15 land commissioner			1
" the family will be behind him 100 % if he decides to do it			2
" @entity6 is the fourth member of his father 's immediate family to weigh in publicly on his dad 's potential candidacy			1
and while he says he thinks his father is " still assessing it , " other members of the family have not been shy about publicly pressuring @entity3 to consider a bid			1
earlier this month , his older brother , former president @entity29 , told @entity30 that he thinks " he ( his brother ) wants to be president			2
" " he and i did have a conversation			0
i of course was pushing him to run for president			1
he of course was saying , ' i have n't made up my mind , ' " @entity29 said in the @entity30 interview			0
" he 's seen his dad , he 's seen his brother			0
and so he 's a very thoughtful man and he 's -- he 's weighing his options			0
" in april , @entity3 's younger brother @entity43 said their father , former president @entity44 , also endorsed the idea			1
" if you asked @entity51 the same question -- ' should @entity3 run ? ' -- he 'd say yes , " @entity47 said in an interview with @entity1 's @entity49			1
" yeah , he would say yeah			0
" but not every member of the @entity56 family is on board with another @entity3 running for a seat in the @entity59			1
before the men in the family had begun floating the idea , former first lady @entity60 dismissed the notion , suggesting that her family has had its turn governing the country			0
" i think this is a great @entity70 country , great country			0
and if we ca n't find more than two or three families to run for high office , that 's silly , because there are great governors and great eligible people to run , " she said			1
while the former first lady acknowledged that her son is undoubtedly qualified for the role , she did admit , " i hope he wo n't			0
" " i think he 'll get all my enemies ( and ) all his brother 's , " @entity60 told @entity83 in january			0
" and there are other families			0
i refuse to accept that this great country is n't raising other wonderful people			0
" despite all of the public clamor surrounding @entity3 's potential candidacy , his son @entity3 admitted that the question has n't surfaced during family gatherings , although the issue is " the 800 - pound gorilla in the room			1
'' " a lot of people are waiting to see what @entity51 does , '' @entity3 said in an interview thursday with @entity98			2
" there 's a lot of pressure to run			2
" @entity3 has not been shy about discussing the prospect of a campaign with some of the most important influencers in the hypothetical race			2
earlier this week , @entity3 was bombarded with questions about a possible run when he met with donors and business leaders in @entity115 , multiple sources at the meeting told @entity1			1
and while his early visit to a swing state is notable , his travel circuit around the country to raise money for @entity56 hopefuls in competitive races is also telling			0
last week , @entity3 stumped in @entity123 for @entity124 , who faces a closely watched race against sitting rep. @entity126			2
in september , he attended fund - raisers for struggling incumbent sen. @entity128 in @entity129 , gubernatorial hopeful @entity130 in @entity131 , and in @entity4 for sen. @entity132 of @entity133			0
this week , @entity3 will travel to @entity134 -- another swing state -- to campaign for @entity137 hopeful rep. @entity136 , who faces a tight contest with sitting sen. @entity139 .			2
