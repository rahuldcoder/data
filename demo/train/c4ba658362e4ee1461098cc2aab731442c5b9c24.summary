-- it 's a rare thing for the threads of an ongoing crisis to be pulled so closely together in a discrete event , compressed in time and space as if they were part of a dramatization , as they were when president @entity11 met @entity13 prime minister @entity12 this month in the @entity14			1
this session had it all : primal @entity13 , @entity18 , @entity19 and even @entity20 interests ; nuclear proliferation and global energy supplies ; existential dangers ; war and peace			1
the meeting was no doubt made more difficult by the strained relations between the two leaders , but in truth , this one needed little personal antipathy to make it hard			0
even though both men had announced that @entity18 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon was unacceptable , there was no final agreement on how to prevent that from happening			1
in many ways , i suspect , the two men talked past one another			0
recall high school math and being forced to solve algebraic equations ? something like that may have taken place in the @entity14 , with @entity11 pointing out how hard we were working to solve for " y " where " y " represented @entity18 intentions			1
unfortunately , in the prime minister 's equation , " y " had already been defined as a constant			0
@entity13 believes that it knows where the @entity18 are going			1
in its equation , the unknown is " x. " what does the @entity19 intend to do about it ? clearly , the president was aware of this			2
comments about having @entity13 's back , rejecting containment , even a little tough talk about not being one to bluff -- all this was calibrated to convince @entity12 that this president would act			1
but when ? on the long flight back to @entity71 , @entity12 was surely asking himself that question			0
@entity13 's window of opportunity to attack @entity18 's nuclear network is closing			1
even allowing for @entity13 ingenuity and courage , this was never going to be easy , and it 's getting harder by the day , as much of the target is being moved into a fortified mountain near @entity82			2
if @entity13 defers the attack much longer , its military option will simply cease to exist as the @entity18 program gets more hardened , more dispersed and more advanced			1
the @entity19 window , of course , will remain open longer , a reflection of the raw numbers , weapons , mobility , range and proximate basing that the @entity19 can bring to bear			2
but will @entity19 move ? can @entity13 afford to give up its own place in the lineup in the belief that the @entity19 , hitting lower in the order , will actually go up to the plate and take its swings ? and so @entity12 will ask himself , what are their red lines ? what will convince them to act ? secretary of defense @entity106 probably gave the clearest administration statement when he said that if " we get intelligence that they 're proceeding with developing a nuclear weapon , then we will take whatever steps are necessary to stop it			1
" that , combined with the president 's repeated statements that @entity18 getting a nuclear weapon is " unacceptable , " surprisingly aligns this administration with the @entity121 administration 's doctrine of pre-emption			1
that doctrine famously described it as a duty to " anticipate and counter threats , using all elements of national power , before the threats can do grave damage			0
" combining " unacceptable " with " whatever steps are necessary " seems to put @entity18 's possession of a weapon -- or , more accurately , an @entity18 decision to pursue a weapon -- in that doctrine 's category of " hostile acts by our adversaries			1
" and that imposes quite a burden on @entity19 intelligence			2
i recall thinking with the announcement of the pre-emption approach in 2001 - 02 ( while i was director of the @entity147 ) of how good @entity19 intelligence would have to be to identify such threats and to identify them at the confidence level that would be needed to justify @entity19 shooting first			1
how tall an order that could be was evident in the 2002 @entity152 on @entity154 's weapons of mass destruction			0
there the intelligence community not only got most of it wrong -- there was no active nuclear program , nor were there chemical or biological weapons stockpiles -- we compounded the mistake with overconfident language that invited others to use intelligence as evidence			1
intelligence is designed to inform policy - making even in the face of doubt , to allow officials to judge potential action while ambiguity still exists			2
it rarely reaches the level of evidence required in a court of law to prove matters beyond a reasonable doubt			0
we may have gotten it a little better in 2007 , when we informed the president that @entity183 had built a nuclear reactor with @entity186 assistance			0
however , we cautioned him that we had low confidence that it was part of a nuclear weapons program , not because there was an alternative explanation that made much sense but simply because our body of knowledge on the other parts needed for such a program ( like a reprocessing facility or weaponization work ) was pretty thin			2
in that instance , the president rejected pre-emption			0
( the site was bombed by @entity13 aircraft			0
) and now with @entity18 , intelligence judgments remain anchored to a controversial 2007 @entity152 that in 2003 , @entity205 had " halted " its nuclear weapon design and weaponization work			1
that estimate was based not on the absence of evidence that such work was ongoing but rather on evidence that it was not			0
and despite some suspicious and troubling @entity18 activity since then , the estimate has survived largely intact , under three subsequent heads of national intelligence and of the @entity217			2
the challenge for @entity19 intelligence now is to inform the president of an @entity18 decision to weaponize its nuclear stockpile with sufficient confidence and in sufficient time for him to decide to launch a pre-emptive war in one of the world 's most sensitive and volatile regions			1
it 's hard to imagine a higher bar , especially since building the " sufficient confidence " will almost certainly eat into the " sufficient time			2
" and especially since , when that last situation room meeting is held , the intelligence will probably not be at that courtroom evidentiary standard of beyond all reasonable doubt			0
the president showed that he could act in the face of ambiguity when he launched the @entity242 raid to kill @entity243			0
this one will be even more difficult			0
for @entity12 , we can identify this as " x. " for the importance of " x , " see above			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			0

@entity251 : @entity19 policy on @entity18 implies pre-emption idea from @entity121 administration
he says @entity13 want to know if @entity19 would act on @entity18 nuclear sites in time
@entity251 says a decision to stop @entity18 's nuclear program requires strong intelligence
he says it 's a high bar to prove that @entity18 decided on developing nuclear program
