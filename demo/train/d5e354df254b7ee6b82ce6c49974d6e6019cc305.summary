@entity1 , @entity0 -- budgets spiraling out of control ; cast and crew on the verge of collapse ; sets destroyed : just a few of the catastrophes to afflict the ill - fated productions in @entity14 's @entity13 movie shoots from hell			1
@entity16 and @entity17 on the set of " @entity19			1
" a typhoon destroyed the sets during this notoriously difficult production			2
from " @entity24 " to " @entity19 , " these infamous productions have all been struck by extreme weather , tragedy , illness and sometimes death			2
amazingly , despite the setbacks , these shoots did n't always result in failure			1
some of these films are cinematic gems -- although this list has its fair share of flops as well			2
do n't agree ? think we 've missed one ? let us know in the @entity40 box below			2
' @entity19 ' ( @entity17 , 1979 ) a typhoon that destroyed sets , illness and madness , all marred this notoriously difficult production in the @entity47			2
with no ending , an overweight @entity48 and his reputation on the line , @entity17 withdrew into himself and the shoot spiraled out of control , according to his wife @entity54 , whose footage was used in making - of documentary " @entity56			2
" the shoot drove @entity17 to breaking point and also took a toll on the cast -- star @entity62 suffered a heart attack aged 38			2
' @entity64 ' ( @entity65 , 1980 ) a disastrous @entity66 that nearly brought down @entity67 , the studio founded by @entity68			1
given free rein , @entity65 overspent massively and the original budget of $ 8 million ballooned to a whopping $ 36 million			2
the historical drama eventually clocked in at three and a half hours			2
it was slammed by critics and bombed at the box office , paving the way for the sale of @entity67 to @entity78			2
shaken by the extent of the failure , which is still considered one of the biggest in @entity84 history , studios clamped down on the freewheeling excesses of the 1970s and a new , more conservative era was born			1
' @entity88 ' ( @entity87 , 1982 ) during this life - threatening shoot , @entity87 made cast and crew haul a steamship over a mountain to tell the story of an music fanatic who wants to build an opera house in jungle			1
@entity87 , who did n't want to use special effects , hired local @entity100 to achieve the feat. as if the challenge of pulling a 320 - ton boat was n't enough to deal with , the production was plagued by heavy rains , casting problems -- lead actor @entity107 had to be replaced by @entity108 due to illness , while @entity110 dropped out due to a @entity112 concert -- and a border war that broke out between @entity114 and @entity115			1
' @entity116 : the movie ' ( @entity118 , 1983 ) tragedy hit the production of @entity118 ' feature film version of the tv series when a special - effects explosion caused a helicopter to lose control during a @entity127 scene			1
lead actor @entity128 and child actors @entity130 and my - ca @entity131 were killed when the helicopter crashed on them			1
@entity118 and other crew members were charged with involuntary manslaughter			0
all plead not guilty and were acquitted of the charges			0
' @entity24 ' ( @entity141 , 1963 ) the historical epic starring @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 nearly bankrupted @entity142			0
shooting dragged on for years , with production being halted several times due to @entity138 's illnesses			0
at one point , she nearly died after catching pneumonia and had to undergo an emergency tracheotomy			0
the movie had its fair share of scandal too , thanks to the affair @entity138 and @entity140 started during filming			1
by the time the movie was finally finished , it had a new director ( @entity141 signed on after @entity160 resigned ) , was over schedule and way over budget			0
some estimates put the final cost at $ 60 million , making it one of the most expensive movies ever made if translated into today 's dollars			0
' the man who killed @entity170 ' ( @entity169 , unfinished ) @entity169 's attempt to bring @entity173 's hero to the big screen began unraveling from the first day of filming			1
lead actor @entity176 immediately fell ill , and if that was n't calamitous enough , a flash flood washed away the entire set in northern @entity180			1
@entity176 eventually ended up in the hospital and since co-star @entity182 had other commitments and could n't wait for @entity176 to recover , @entity169 was forced to abandon the film			0
the whole shoot is chronicled in 2002 documentary " lost in @entity187			0
" the ambitious director recently told movie magazine , @entity189 , that the project is up and running again and that shooting will begin next spring			0
no word yet though on who will play the man of @entity187			0
' @entity195 ' ( @entity196 , 1994 ) this ill - fated production took a tragic turn after lead @entity199 died on set in 1993			1
he was shot by a misloaded prop gun			0
the untimely death of @entity199 , the son of martial arts legend @entity204 who suffered a bizarre death of his own in 1973 ( father and son are buried side - by - side in @entity211 ) , added an eerie dimension to the already dark film about a man who comes back from the dead			0
' @entity216 : the @entity218 ' ( @entity87 , 1972 ) it 's no surprise that controversial director @entity87 makes this list twice			1
while filming " @entity216 , " he threatened to shoot @entity108 when the actor tried to bail on the film			1
@entity87 has said that as @entity108 was packing this things into a speed boat to make his escape , he told him very quietly that he " would have eight bullets through his head before he reached the next bend of the river			1
" while @entity87 denies wielding a gun at the time he made the threat , he has said he did have a gun on set			1
' @entity235 ' ( @entity236 , 2000 ) @entity236 has a reputation for being hard on his actors and for @entity241 singer @entity240 's acting debut , he certainly did n't pull any punches			0
it 's rumored that @entity240 became so unhinged during the shoot that she ate her own cardigan			0
@entity236 has claimed that every morning @entity240 would say , " mr. @entity236 , i despise you , " and spit at him			0
the experience was so traumatic for @entity240 that afterwards she insisted she 'd never act again			0
' @entity249 ' ( @entity250 , 1999 ) director @entity250 and actor @entity248 are reported to have physically confronted each other on the set of this @entity254 war drama over the filmmaker 's treatment of an extra			1
five years later , @entity250 famously blew up at veteran actress @entity257 after she berated him while filming " @entity258 " in 2004 -- an episode that became a hit on @entity261			1
" i felt bad for @entity257 , " @entity248 said about the " @entity258 " incident to @entity263 in 2007			0
" but i also felt a little vindicated for anyone that thought that that had anything to do with me on [ " @entity249 " ]			0
@entity250 , for his part , says he is not the biggest fan of movie stars			1
" @entity248 went a long way towards that , " he told @entity275 broadsheet @entity274 in 2004 .			0

these shoots endured a string of disastrous setbacks before calling it a wrap
@entity87 threatened to kill an actor who tried to leave the set of " @entity216 "
" @entity64 " is considered one of the biggest failures in @entity84 history
