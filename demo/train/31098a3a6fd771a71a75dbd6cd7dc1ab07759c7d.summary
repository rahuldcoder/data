@entity0 , @entity1 -- even among the hundreds of applications , this one stood out			0
most applicants to creative writing programs submit stories about the angst of their suburban childhoods			1
this writer 's stories concerned the daily ordeals of a boy living with his family on the streets of @entity16 , @entity17 , and the horrific plight of a @entity21 girl whose mother is @entity22 and father @entity23			1
not only did the applicant have what writers call " material , " he was blessed with an uncanny ear for human speech and the poetry to describe his characters ' very unpoetic lives			2
i can still remember the young @entity17 boy watching his mother decant the glue she intends to sniff			0
the glue , the boy tells us , " glowed warm and yellow in the dull light , " and when his mother had poured enough , " she cut the flow of the glue by tilting the tin up			0
the last stream of gum entering the bottle weakened and braided itself before tapering in midair like an icicle			0
" still , this applicant gave us pause			0
the writer had so much to say , he seemed to be trying to channel a raging waterfall through the tiny funnels of two short stories			2
his use of punctuation was idiosyncratic , to say the least			0
and the applicant was a priest ! would the other students be willing to share their stories , rife as these tend to be with profanity , drugs and sex , if a clergyman was in the room ? and would this particular clergyman understand what all great religious writers know -- that true literature does n't spring from one 's certainties about the universe , but rather from one 's questions ? that said , how could our students be inhibited by a classmate who did n't hesitate to describe a 12 - year - old @entity17 prostitute being paid by rich white tourists to perform sexual acts with their monkey ? as to the shapelessness of the applicant 's prose and the eccentricity of his punctuation , anyone with this writer 's gifts could be taught to structure his material and punctuate his characters ' speech correctly			1
if i still felt apprehensive about having a priest in my workshop , that anxiety vanished when @entity105 walked in the room			1
rather than wear his clerical garb and collar , @entity105 showed up in a blue and maize @entity110 sweatshirt			1
with his wide , gap - toothed smile , wall - shaking laugh , disarming candor and gleeful giggle , he exuded magnetic charm			0
nor was @entity105 out of place for being the only @entity118 in his cohort			1
despite what the judges of the @entity123 might say about @entity126 writers being too insular to compete with their @entity128 counterparts , this country 's mfa programs provide one of the only spaces on the planet where writers of many races , religions , nationalities and sexual orientations can come together			2
writers find common ground not through the homelands they once inhabited but the thematic questions with which they grapple			0
early that first semester , i assigned a story by @entity143 called " @entity144 , " in which a @entity146 sergeant who has witnessed the horrors of the concentration camps must decide whether to grant special favors to the @entity146 recruits in his command or enforce strict impartiality			0
i did n't know whether @entity105 would connect to @entity143 's quintessentially @entity146 outlook			1
but the moment the discussion started , @entity105 's hand shot up			1
" this is the story of my continent ! " he declared			0
if @entity159 continued to put tribal allegiances above universal fairness , @entity105 said , progress would remain unattainable			1
this abhorrence of tribalism is what makes @entity105 so open - minded			1
like most people who are comfortable in their own skins , he is wonderfully able to inhabit the skins of others			2
one semester , he audited a seminar on @entity172 literature			0
the professor had no idea who @entity105 was , so she could n't help but be surprised when he asked , " can you tell me , please , how is it that people can do such terrible things to one another ? " if anyone else had asked that question , the professor might have thought he was simpleminded			1
but she could tell that this mysterious stranger was asking his question in the most profound way , from the depths of his own experience			0
a few months later , @entity105 accompanied me to my temple for the @entity191			1
after sitting -- and standing -- for hours through the service , he commented that he had studied in the @entity194 how @entity195 opened the scroll to read , but he had never quite understood how that worked , so it was beautiful for him to see how the @entity146 really did that			0
and he was happy to note what @entity200 had copied from @entity202			0
just as @entity203 opened his mind and heart to us , i opened my mind and heart to @entity105			1
an atheist with a degree in physics , i do n't believe in prayer			0
and yet , when @entity105 stopped by the evening before a frightening operation on my spine , i granted his request that he pray for my well - being			1
startled by the warmth i felt flowing along my spine as @entity203 held his hands above my head , i burst out crying			0
of course , my colleagues and i never forgot why @entity105 was in @entity0 , @entity1			1
during his two years in our program , all of us worked hard to help him develop his many gifts			2
but mine was the first workshop @entity105 took , and i saw his stories at their rawest			1
as i waded through the reams of rough drafts he had given me , it occurred to me that i had been called upon to help the children of @entity159 the only way i could -- by helping @entity203 to write their stories			1
we talked about the need to focus each story around a single character 's conflict and a single thematic question rather than attempting to convey everything @entity105 knew about all his characters			1
i also urged him to allow his young protagonists at least a chance for freedom or redemption			0
yes , the children whose lives he wanted to depict were the victims of adults who abused , exploited and betrayed them			2
but even in a society in which a child can be prostituted to provide her family 's food and pay her brother 's school fees , the prostitute 's brother might choose to decline that money , to leave the family , to walk away			2
@entity105 listened attentively , but i was n't sure that he believed what i was saying			2
i did n't see another version of his story about the street family in @entity16 for several months			0
when i did , the hairs at the back of my neck stood up			0
that second version of " an @entity266 " was so powerful and finely polished that i asked @entity105 if he would send it to the deputy fiction editor of @entity269 , whom i had met a few weeks earlier when the magazine brought its college tour to @entity0			2
@entity105 hesitated -- i did n't know this , but he already had submitted an earlier version of the story , twice , to " the editor " at @entity269 -- but i kept nagging him until he sent the new version			2
the rest , as they say , is history			0
the magazine accepted @entity105 's story for its fiction issue			1
then , a year later , it published a revised version of the story about the half - @entity22 , half - @entity23 @entity21 girl			0
in many ways , @entity105 's success makes sense			1
even when he was studying to be a priest , he gave up precious hours of sleep to stay up writing			0
he applied to an @entity293 program and got accepted			0
his teachers recognized his extraordinary potential and helped @entity105 to achieve it			2
and yet , much of @entity203 's success is inexplicable			0
in a world in which so little attention is paid to children 's suffering , a world in which fewer and fewer publishing houses remain interested in acquiring literary fiction and independent bookstores , even in college towns such as @entity0 , are closing their doors , the editors at every major publishing house in @entity299 competed for the privilege of publishing a book that might not sell many copies but had shaken them to the core			1
and @entity315 ... how could @entity315 , who had never selected a collection of stories for her book club , choose a collection like @entity105 's , with its multilingual patois , complete absence of pathos or sentimentality and nearly unbearable - to - read violence toward children ? yet all of this came to pass			1
@entity315 respected her audience enough to assume that if she was so deeply moved by @entity105 's stories , they would be moved as well			1
in choosing " @entity331 , " @entity315 brought to @entity105 's cause the intelligence and heart of her many readers			1
that any of this happened at all , let alone in five short years , is a literary miracle			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity340 .			2

@entity340 : there was concern about @entity105 's application to a writing program
she says he fit in well and his talent soon became *evident*
@entity353 's blessed with great talent for hearing people and with poetic writing ability , she says
his book of stories about @entity159 children has been selected by @entity315 's book club
