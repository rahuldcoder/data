-- @entity1 is one of the world 's most mysterious and secretive states , regarded as a political pariah and at bitter loggerheads with its neighbor @entity9			1
few people are allowed past its tightly - sealed borders but footballer @entity13 , who was born and raised in @entity14 by a loyally @entity1 family , is in a privileged position when it comes to entering and exiting			1
the 31 - year - old is captain of top @entity14 club @entity19 , and also plays for the national side of @entity1 -- which in the past has faced allegations of mistreatment of its sports teams after major events			1
" my number one hope is for @entity30 to become united , " he told @entity0 's human to @entity28			0
" i think it will contribute to the development of the country in many ways			0
i think it will open up new possibilities beyond soccer and sports			0
" a hero to football fans in both @entity14 and @entity1 , @entity13 symbolizes the unique power of sport to break down boundaries despite deep - seated differences			1
he does not talk about politics with his @entity1 teammates -- " they ask me about cars or soccer magazines i have with me " -- but his own views have been shaped by his upbringing , in which he had to gain acceptance in two very different societies			2
the @entity1 community in @entity14 has an uneasy relationship , at best , with the indigenous population , amid a perpetual state of mistrust on both sides			1
ongoing tensions over disputed territory -- a small group of islands situated between @entity14 and the @entity65 -- has ratcheted up the political rhetoric and fueled prejudices			2
but not only has @entity13 won respect for his footballing feats , helping his team from @entity73 division two also - rans to top - flight championship contenders , he has also achieved cult status , regardless of his background			1
" i think 90 % of the @entity19 's supporters do n't care about whether he is @entity1 or @entity14 , " local businessman @entity79 , a loyal club fan , told @entity0			1
legendary player " we feel he loves the team			0
he is a legend and his story should be remembered , even after he retires , " he added			0
@entity13 , who has been with the club since 2004 , admitted he was initially apprehensive about the reaction of fans			2
" i wondered if people would cheer me , a @entity1 , but once i was on the team and started playing , i felt l like i was being supported a lot , " he said			1
" the fans love this team , their local team , and they support me as a part of the team , maybe even more so than to other members			0
" watch : chasing @entity1 's football team born in 1982 , @entity13 grew up in the city of @entity101 with @entity1 parents , who are second generation immigrants to @entity14			1
@entity14 occupied the @entity65 from 1905 to 1945			2
well over half a million @entity1 who came to @entity14 during that troubled period stayed after @entity106 ended , including @entity13 's grandfather			1
the subsequent @entity108 led to two bitterly divided states in the @entity30 , and @entity1 immigrants left in @entity14 also split into separate communities			1
strict loyalty one of the consequences was special @entity1 schools , where the @entity1 's flag could be seen flying in the playground , with portraits of leaders such as @entity119 and @entity120 on the classroom walls			2
strict loyalty to that regime is engendered , and that is the education that @entity13 received up until high school when , thanks to his sporting and academic achievements , he entered the mainstream @entity14 university system			1
but the limited range of sporting opportunities in his early schooling also played an inadvertent role in his subsequent professional career			0
" my father introduced me to football when i was two or three years old , " he recalled			0
" then i went to @entity1 schools where only football was available , and myself and other students would play from morning to night -- so in that sense , i think i was blessed			2
" @entity13 was also blessed with a formidable talent and , on leaving education in 2003 found his place in the @entity19 squad , then playing in the @entity73 second division			1
it was not long before international recognition arrived -- though not for @entity14 ( " i have never thought about it " ) but through his upbringing and family ties , for @entity1			1
representing his country in @entity151 , @entity13 scored in a 2 - 0 win over @entity9 in the semifinals of the @entity154			1
winning acceptance he admits his enthusiasm to impress , to win acceptance as an " outsider " got the better of him as he charged around the pitch in his midfield role			0
" i played in a reckless manner			0
i felt the need to impress so they would invite me again to play in the national team			0
" @entity13 did impress enough to secure further call - ups , one of a small cadre of @entity14 - based players with a similar background , who represent @entity1			1
he was top scorer as @entity1 won the 2010 @entity170 , and also took part in a successful qualification campaign for that year 's 2010 @entity174 finals			1
but it is in club football in the highly competitive @entity73 where he has made the biggest impression , with @entity19 emerging as challengers for the first division title in recent seasons			1
@entity13 has been an ever present and key member of the side , but it was the shattering events of march 11 , 2011 -- when an earthquake and tsunami hit @entity14 -- which firmly cemented him as a fan favorite			1
@entity187 was near the epicenter of the quake and @entity13 was out driving when it hit			2
" i thought my tires had gone flat or i had driven over the curb , but the shaking continued and i saw the windows of shops shaking too , " he recalled			0
" i knew it was a bad one and rushed home to see my wife			0
" earthquake disaster @entity13 and his heavily pregnant wife spent the night sleeping in their car , fearful of further damage to buildings in an urban landscape that suffered severe wreckage			1
in the aftermath of the disaster , @entity13 and his teammates made frequent visits to affected areas to lend support			2
the performances of the team also boosted morale , eventually finishing fourth in the @entity73 with @entity13 providing inspiring captaincy , @entity79 , a restaurant owner in the coastal town of @entity219 which was heavily hit by the tsunami , said @entity13 and his teammates made all the difference in those terrible times for the area			1
" during the tsunami year , @entity19 and his play gave us an energy , whether they won or lost , " @entity79 said			1
" we are so grateful that he led the team to fourth in the league that year			2
" we also would like to thank him that he has stayed with our team despite getting good offers from other teams ( in the @entity73 )			2
" @entity13 's international career has involved intermittent trips to @entity236 , the capital of @entity1 , where he joins up with the domestic based players			1
it is seen as one of the most secretive setups in world soccer , due to the @entity1 government 's isolationist policies			2
affluent lifestyle however , aside from their interest in the trappings of the affluent lifestyle in @entity14 , @entity13 said his teammates were well acquainted with the action from major football leagues such as the @entity252 and @entity254 's @entity253			1
" their in - depth knowledge of famous players demonstrates to me that they do watch a lot of soccer on television , " he revealed			0
so when @entity1 qualified for the 2010 @entity174 finals in @entity262 , drawn to play mighty @entity263 in the first group match , it 's safe to say they would have known all about @entity266 and @entity267 and their teammates			2
@entity13 missed out on selection for the tournament , though he trained with the squad as cover			0
despite his personal disappointment , he describes @entity1 's narrow 2 - 1 defeat by the five - time world champion @entity263 team as his " most memorable match , a moving experience			1
" that match was a high point -- but @entity1 's @entity174 ended in embarrassment , losing 7 - 0 to @entity283 and then 3 - 0 to the @entity284			2
the squad and head coach @entity285 were reportedly publicly humiliated by government officials on their return home , though in august 2010 soccer 's world governing body halted its investigation into the claims after failing to find enough evidence			0
in a statement on its official website , @entity294 described the allegations as " baseless			0
" role models @entity13 had starred in @entity1 's lifting of the @entity170 in the @entity174 year , contributing goals from @entity301 ( " every goal felt amazing " ) and also helped the team retain the trophy last year			1
2012 was also to prove his most successful season at club level , with @entity19 finishing second in the league , beaten to the title by @entity309 in the closing stages of the season			2
despite being in the autumn of his career , @entity13 has entertained no thoughts of retiring and retains a real love for his sport			0
" soccer is part of my life , and it 's also my job and i never get tired of it , " he said			0
his role models are players such as @entity323 of @entity324 and former @entity326 great @entity325 -- both attacking midfielders in his mold			0
@entity13 admits that @entity325 , who is now manager of @entity73 side @entity328 , was his hero from boyhood days : " i 've always admired him			1
" like @entity325 , @entity13 has assumed a captaincy role with his club and takes his responsibilities incredibly seriously			0
" i need to have a strong presence in the team , and i also need to be trusted by other players , " is his philosophy on leadership			0
" i make sure that i run the most , try to stay in the game all the time and make a big effort to change the outcome			0
" he might be a dogged hard worker on the pitch , but off it he does indulge in a passion he shares with many football stars			0
i do not have any favorite model , but when i am allowed to test drive one , i love it instantly and end up buying it , " he says			0
" as i am not a player blessed with speed , i tend to drive a fast car			0
everyone tells me i drive fast and rough			0
