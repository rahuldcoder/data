-- @entity3 police captain @entity2 's body has n't been confirmed found , yet that did n't deter authorities from announcing friday that they have charged five people in connection with his disappearance and his death			1
scores of police opened a press conference friday -- exactly one week after @entity2 's family last reported seeing him -- by turning to face a flag as it was lowered to half - staff in @entity2 's memory			1
addressing @entity2 's family , @entity19 -- the police chief in the small central @entity20 of @entity21 where the 45 - year - old @entity2 was a volunteer officer and also lived -- said , " words can not begin to express the sorrow we feel just knowing that you are bearing such a profound loss			1
" authorities have not said how , when or why @entity2 died			1
nor have they specified his relation to those involved in his disappearance and death , including whether he knew them personally , was targeted for his police work or perhaps was randomly targeted			2
speaking in a general sense to law enforcement colleagues , @entity19 said , " i ask that you continue to honor 's @entity2 memory and let his tragic loss serve as a reminder that the work that we have dedicated our lives to is not finished			2
" @entity45 spokeswoman @entity44 then spoke about a man 's body found on thursday near the @entity50 - @entity49 county line , between @entity51 and @entity52 , before adding that it had n't yet been positively identified as @entity2 or as anyone else			1
" however , due to the time that has transpired since @entity2 's disappearance , the fact that his vehicle was abandoned , and his whereabouts have not been established yet , we have transitioned from a disappearance investigation to a death investigation , " @entity44 said			1
the police spokeswoman detailed a number of significant developments in the case , including the arrests of three individuals -- 22 - year - old @entity70 , 49 - year - old @entity71 and 31 - year - old @entity72 , @entity73 -- " without incident " on thursday night outside of a @entity75 hotel			2
all three are being held without bond at @entity79 on felony charges of being " a principal in the second degree " to @entity2 's death and of gang participation			1
this is in addition to previously announced arrests of three siblings tuesday night at a hotel in the @entity91 suburb of @entity92 , @entity3			2
@entity93 and his sister , @entity94 , have been charged with grand larceny in the theft of @entity2 's 1999 @entity97			1
a second sister , @entity98 -- who has not yet charged directly in @entity2 's case -- was picked up on an outstanding warrant from @entity101 , east of @entity52 , where sunday night 's armed robbery took place , @entity44 said earlier this week			1
the 18 - year - old @entity93 also was charged with robbery , malicious wounding and a variety of weapons - related charges in connection with the sunday - night robbery , but no details of that holdup were released			0
@entity44 , from the state police , said investigators " are still piecing together ... this network of individuals and determining exactly what role , what acquaintance , what association they may have had with one another			0
" she emphasized that no one yet has been deemed directly responsible for @entity2 's death			1
still , murder charges could be forthcoming -- perhaps against someone who has n't been arrested yet			2
" there are additional charges pending in this , " @entity44 said			0
" there may possibly still be additional arrests			0
" arrests made in truck theft , but police captain still missing last seen by family one week ago in 1990 , @entity2 joined his father in the reserve arm of the @entity21 , @entity3 , police department -- members of which are n't paid but hold ranks , have badges and carry firearms like full - timers			1
he rose up the ranks while working paying day jobs , including the past 15 years as a production coordinator for the synthetic fabrics company @entity146			0
his position there was eliminated in what @entity21 police sgt. @entity149 called an " amicable " separation			0
the morning of friday , january 31 , he 'd taken his mother -- with whom he was living in @entity154 -- out to breakfast at a local @entity156			0
that meal was the last time @entity2 's credit card was used , according to @entity149			1
he 'd also spent that day prepping for his brother 's surprise birthday celebration , including getting the venue and music in order			0
@entity2 had been legally separated from his wife since 2007 , but their divorce was not final , @entity149 said			2
he said another woman gave birth to @entity2 's daughter four months ago , and he was headed to their home in neighboring @entity172 at the time he disappeared			1
according to an affidavit , @entity2 texted his child 's mother , saying he was on the way			2
his phone has been turned off since last friday night			0
in fact , he was last seen about 10:15 p.m. that night leaving the @entity154 , @entity3 , home that he shared with his mother			0
authorities said his family believed the officer was off duty at the time and heading to a friend 's house in neighboring @entity172 about 20 miles away			2
but he never made it there			0
@entity189 showed up for family birthday party his family reported him missing the following day , after @entity2 failed to show up for the birthday party for his brother that he 'd planned			1
his @entity97 was captured by surveillance cameras at automatic teller machines twice			0
the first time was in the town of @entity197 , about 50 miles from @entity154 , about 11:40 friday night ; the second was in @entity199 , on the outskirts of @entity91 , on saturday night , @entity44 said			0
each time , the same two people were in the picture , she said -- but authorities have n't said which , if any , of those arrested were in the image			2
the suv turned up parked under a carport on rural property in @entity209 , more than 30 miles northeast of @entity197 , on monday			0
three days later , state police and a @entity49 investigator went down @entity214 after getting " some intelligence that these individuals may have been out there , the vehicle may have been out in that area			0
" they stopped and found a man 's body shortly before noon in a wooded area on private property			1
that body was transported to the @entity224 in @entity51 to undergo an autopsy and be positively identified			0
such an identification is n't the only missing piece of the puzzle			2
authorities also still have n't found a weapon that may have been used to kill @entity2 , nor have they publicly outlined a motive			1
but on friday , they did begin the grieving process			0
@entity19 , the @entity21 police chief , urged people to look out for @entity2 's family , friends and former colleagues			1
" no one can make it through this alone , " he said			0
" we must continue to support @entity2 's family , his friends , and our brothers and sisters from our law enforcement family			1
" @entity0 's @entity248 contributed to this story .			0
