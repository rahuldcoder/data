when secretary of state @entity1 first took office he talked of changing @entity5 president @entity4 's calculus			1
@entity4 " needs to know that he ca n't shoot his way out of this , " @entity1 said in march at a @entity7 meeting with members of the @entity5 opposition			1
when he and @entity15 foreign minister @entity14 first conceived the idea of bringing the regime and the opposition together for peace talks in @entity20 , they believed strengthened international support for both the political opposition and rebel forces would leave the @entity5 leader ready to negotiate his own ouster			1
@entity28 policy since then has had the opposite effect			1
@entity4 's calculus has indeed changed			1
the political opposition is on the verge of collapse , rebel groups now having to battle the growing strength of @entity34 forces on the ground , and his regime is at the center of implementing an international deal to rid the country of chemical weapons			2
he heads to @entity20 believing the false narrative that he is even more powerful			2
as his forces continue to kill thousands each week from barrel bombs with impunity , @entity4 has no reason to think he ca n't shoot his way out of the crisis			1
representatives of @entity5 's main opposition group voted saturday to attend next week 's peace talks in @entity20			1
leading up to the vote , the opposition was bitterly divided on whether to attend at all			0
members of the opposition suggest that the @entity28 is setting them up to fail by not providing the @entity58 with sufficient resources to change the balance of power on the ground			1
" is the opposition being set up for success by @entity28 , not just to participate in a conference that will lead to a political solution , but being empowered to ensure success of the stated objectives of @entity20 ? " asked @entity62 , a senior adviser to the opposition			1
" it is the position of the opposition that you can not have a successful political process if the @entity28 does n't also increase its support			1
right now , the regime thinks its winning			0
they think they have successfully avoided military strikes , western sanctions and repercussions for continued war crimes			0
it is these components that make any successful outcomes of @entity20 unlikely , " @entity62 said			2
for months , @entity28 ambassador to @entity5 @entity88 has shuttled to @entity89 to meet with members of the @entity91			2
in preparing for @entity20 , @entity92 and other @entity28 officials repeatedly urged the opposition to present a transition plan that saw the group playing a major role in a post @entity4 government , which could include some elements of the current government			1
now the group is being implored to just show up			0
the @entity103 administration maintains it still believes @entity4 should step down			2
but rather than hand over power , he is talking about running for re-election this spring in what is all but certain to be a fraudulent election			0
and the opposition , whose legitimacy is mostly conferred upon them by the international community , appears to be in no position to force his hand			0
" the @entity5 opposition is in a space capsule heading toward @entity20 and breaking up in the atmosphere and this may be one of the @entity122 's biggest failures , " says @entity114 , director of the @entity115			1
" @entity20 has put unbearable pressure on an opposition that has always lacked unity and direction and this has a great bearing for any process the international powers are looking to launch , " @entity114 said			1
having lacked resolve to either use force against @entity4 or arm the opposition , and with no coming together of the @entity132 on even the growing humanitarian crisis , the @entity103 administration now has fewer tools in the toolbox			1
what 's left is the diplomatic " fig leaf " of @entity20 , which few people besides @entity1 believe is more than an effort to check the diplomatic box and manage some sort of response to the @entity5 crisis , rather than demonstrating the mettle to find a solution			1
" despite how everyone tries to dress it up , this is not the right kind of place for the @entity28 to be on what is shaping up to be the biggest humanitarian disaster of this century and which is promising to have the largest loss of life and bloodiest conflict the @entity156 has seen , " @entity114 said			2
" but there is no alternative			0
it is all we have , so now have to go through it and hope for something after @entity20			2
i think it is a misreading of the situation and the whole region			0
i 'm not sure they can stand many more months of this while the ground churns , " @entity114 said			0
@entity5 's ghost homes , ravaged by war moreover , there is no agreement in terms of what the parameters of the @entity20 talks are			2
the @entity28 , @entity179 and other @entity181 and @entity182 countries want talks on a transitional government			2
the @entity5 regime , @entity15 and @entity186 - who wo n't be there as a participant but with thousands of fighters on the ground helping the regime will be the elephant in the room - believe @entity20 is about fighting the growing @entity195 insurgency and rehabilitating @entity4			1
with @entity197 forces continuing to capture territory and even checkpoints on the border with @entity89 , narrative of @entity4 as savior is stronger			2
even as @entity203 is turning up the pressure on the opposition to join the talks , the administration is significantly lowering expectations			0
@entity28 officials concede merely getting the opposition and the regime in the room would be a success			1
" when we first conceptualized the conference , we believed that we would be able to help form a transitional government and that would be that , " one senior @entity214 official acknowledged			0
" but we understand achieving political progress is more challenging eight months later			0
" the first direct talks between the two sides after three years of conflict would be a milestone			0
to jumpstart negotiations over a political transition , @entity1 said he and @entity14 are seeking confidence - building measures , including possible local ceasefires , access for delivery of humanitarian aid and exchange of prisoners			0
agreement on these issues would also be no small feat. with progress toward a transitional government highly unlikely , the conference will now focus as much on the humanitarian crisis as it will on discussions about @entity5 's political future			0
" the humanitarian situation has taken on a greater importance			0
it is an enormous crisis and it is appropriate to focus on that , " another senior @entity28 official said			1
" we still have a desire to see a transitional government and nobody is giving up with that			0
but we are also thinking about what our other objectives are , " the official said			0
81 days captive in @entity5 having accepted the fact that @entity20 is not likely be a turning point for the conflict , the administration now says it hopes @entity20 will be the beginning of a " process			1
" but there is wide trepidation among the @entity5 opposition about a process that is open - ended and fails to stop the violence and suffering			2
" nothing will happen overnight but it ca n't be indefinite , @entity62 said			1
" the regime will drag this process on while it continues to bomb cities and increase its starvation campaign			0
" in addition , any future effort to find a political solution to the @entity5 conflict must focus more on broadening the participation of that process to include more @entity5 with influence on the ground			0
" the biggest failure of @entity20 is that the regime and opposition ca n't turn the corner			1
they ca n't because they do n't represent the majority of @entity5 , " @entity114 said			1
revolutionary councils inside @entity5 , the backbone of the civil resistance , have been providing services to the people and are increasingly becoming the de-facto representation of the @entity5 opposition			0
but those doing the work on the ground , whether it be political or fighting , are not involved in the political process under way			0
he lost his leg in war and now helps others @entity114 , who meets frequently with a cross section of @entity5 said that with all of its planning for a post @entity307 , the international community has yet to help build an indigenous opposition in a meaningful way			0
" @entity311 , @entity312 , tribal leaders , rebel commanders and business associations all need to be brought in and they are n't , " @entity114 said			0
" if i can do that in a little old think tank , how come the international community has n't been able to support that ? " @entity320 softens its stance as next @entity20 talks near			1

@entity4 has no reason to think he ca n't shoot his way out of crisis , @entity324 says
opposition suggests @entity28 is setting them up to fail
@entity331 says it hopes @entity20 will be beginning of a " process "
