@entity1 , @entity0 -- the dominance of @entity0 's @entity4 has been built on its clubs ' ability to lure the world 's best players with high wages			1
@entity11 manager @entity10 believes the @entity13 's tax rate rise will hurt the @entity4 's competitiveness			1
but that could all be about to change after last month 's decision by the @entity13 government to raise the level of top - rate income tax from 60 cents in every $ 1.50 to 75 cents			1
the rate rise , which takes effect from april of 2010 , will mean that some well - off people -- including @entity4 footballers -- will pay half of any income over $ 226,000 in tax			1
and given the average basic salary for a @entity4 player is $ 1.8m , it will make a difference to a lot of players , not just the foreign superstars like @entity35 's @entity34 and @entity37 striker @entity36			1
@entity39 premiership managers such as @entity11 's @entity10 believes the tax hike will hurt the @entity4 's ability to attract the best players while potentially driving out those players unhappy at paying out more in tax			1
@entity10 was asked if the success of @entity39 sides was overly reliant on having the best foreign players			0
" that time will soon be over because with the new taxation system , with the collapse of sterling , the domination of the @entity4 on that front will go , that is for sure , " he told the @entity13 's @entity49 newspaper in a recent interview			1
@entity57 , who works for accountancy firm @entity59 's sports business group , believes @entity10 could be proved right			2
" an increase in the tax rate and the decline of the pound against the @entity64 over the last year to 18 months does put the @entity4 at a disadvantage , " he told @entity2			1
" i 'd say it will have a sizable impact upon the @entity4 's competitiveness against other countries			2
clubs are going to have to think about how they react to it			0
" the @entity4 's ability to remain the most marketable league in the world has been built on the ability to attract the best talent			2
but if that talent is unhappy at seeing half or less of their salaries , other leagues in countries with more generous tax bands may become more enticing			0
@entity84 's top division , @entity83 , is one of the @entity4 's biggest rivals in terms of the quality of its product , and it is likely to be best placed to capitalize should @entity0 drop the ball			2
the reason -- aside from the weather -- is the so - called " @entity94			0
" the country 's government introduced legislation four years ago which effectively caps non-spanish nationals ' tax at 24 percent			2
@entity100 was among the first foreigners to take advantage of it while he was playing for @entity104			0
@entity39 clubs desperate to keep hold of their best players without breaking the bank undoubtedly have a challenge on their hands going into the off - season			0
but there is a little room for maneuver			0
one area is in a player 's image rights , which can be hugely lucrative			0
if a player is aligned to an image rights company , payments into those companies are income of the image rights company , and the player is not taxed on them			0
additionally , the club does not need to make @entity13 social security contributions on those payments			0
so will the tax rise , married to a falling pound , prompt an exodus of players from @entity0 ? " i suspect some of the top players will want to continue to be paid what they 're paid at the moment and it 's up to clubs to decide if they can afford to pay that , " continued @entity57			1
" and it 's a call for the players to make if they believe they can receive more money elsewhere			0
" highest - paid players and top rates of tax per country @entity148 43 per cent @entity149 ( @entity150 ) , @entity151 ( @entity152 ) $ 12m each @entity84 43 percent ( 24 percent for non-nationals ) @entity154 ( @entity155 ) $ 11.2m @entity0 50 percent @entity156 , @entity157 ( both @entity158 ) $ 10.1m each @entity159 35 percent @entity100 ( @entity160 ) $ 6.5m @entity161 35 per cent @entity162 ( @entity163 ) $ 4.5m @entity164 13 percent @entity165 ( @entity166 ) $ 4m @entity167 50 percent @entity168 ( @entity169 ) $ 1.74m sources : @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173			1

top rate of @entity13 tax set to be 50 percent , the fourth highest in the developed world
the average @entity4 footballer 's annual salary is $ 1.8m ( *Â£* 1.2m )
tax *expert* believes rate rise plus weakened pound will hurt @entity4
