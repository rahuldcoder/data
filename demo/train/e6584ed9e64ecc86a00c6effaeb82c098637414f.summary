@entity0 -- the 4 - year - old girl sobbed as rescuers rushed her ashore			1
in the boat behind her , the faces of her fellow survivors were painted with " a thousand - yard stare , " one witness said monday			1
that girl and three others spent 20 hours stranded in stormy water after their 22 - foot boat capsized off the @entity14 over the weekend			1
they were picked up sunday afternoon by @entity17 rescuers			1
a few hours earlier , @entity18 was maneuvering the @entity19 , his fishing charter boat , from @entity21 to the open sea when he and others " saw a big object floating in the distance			2
" " the closer i got , i could see a guy waving , " @entity18 said			0
they found three men clinging to part of what had been their boat			1
one charter customer quickly jumped in to help , while others threw life jackets to the men , only one of which could muster the energy to swim over , @entity18 said			2
once aboard , a language barrier -- the rescued men were @entity41 - speaking -- and raw emotions made it difficult to ascertain exactly what had happened			2
one who did speak @entity46 was very upset : " he lost his mother , " @entity18 explained			1
officer @entity49 of the @entity50 said monday that a son had tried to hold onto his 79 - year - old mother in the hours after their ship went down around noon saturday			2
but she slipped away into the rough waters , @entity49 said , before rescuers could reach her			2
this victim , later identified as @entity59 , and the men had clung to the capsized boat 's hull			1
but four others -- three women and the young girl -- could n't hold on , and drifted off , @entity18 said , based on his conversations with the survivors and authorities			1
the charter boat captain contacted the @entity17 after learning others were unaccounted for , and he took his boat out five miles in the direction where the four had drifted away			1
he saw no signs of them			0
but rescuers did come upon the four sunday morning , bringing them aboard near @entity76 , which is roughly halfway between @entity77 and @entity78 , according to a @entity17 statement authorities later learned that the three women , wearing life jackets , had held tight to a floating cooler and took turns holding the girl through the afternoon , night and next morning			1
" that definitely saved their lives , " @entity49 told @entity1			0
" it could have been a lot worse situation			0
" @entity88 of @entity90 's @entity89 said he watched rescuers bring the four to a dock in @entity76 on sunday			2
they handed the girl off the boat first , he told @entity1 affiliate @entity96			2
" they had her all wrapped up			0
... she could n't stop crying			1
she was panic - stricken , " @entity88 said			0
at the dock , rescuers scrambled to tend to all the victims			0
" they just had that look on their face , like a thousand - yard stare , " @entity88 told @entity96			0
the group had suffered multiple jellyfish stings over the course of their ordeal , @entity49 said			0
and by monday , the 4 - year - old had been treated for mild hypothermia and exhaustion			0
but the wildlife officer added that , by then , she appeared to be " in very good spirits			0
" @entity117 , owner and operator of @entity119 in @entity76 , said weather in the area saturday when the boat went down was terrible			0
" you can get yourself in trouble real quick " on the area 's water , said @entity117 , whose company salvaged the capsized boat			1
