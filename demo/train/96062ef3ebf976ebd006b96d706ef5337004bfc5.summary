@entity0 , @entity1 -- at first glance , it looks like a standard road sign to @entity6 , the @entity1 pilgrimage site for millions of @entity8 every year			1
but look again at this piece of graffiti art and you see that the @entity12 , the cube - shaped building at the spiritual heart of @entity6 shown on its genuine road signs , has been replaced by a cluster of high rise buildings			1
it is the work of @entity20 , a 22 - year - old graphic design graduate , and she sprayed it on walls around her home city of @entity0 as a comment on overdevelopment in @entity6 , the holiest @entity8 city			1
it is a bold statement to make in the socially conservative kingdom of @entity1 , and the method -- spray painting walls in public places -- even more so			1
" at first i was worried about how the conservatives would react and whether i would get any bad comments , but no - one has said anything , " said @entity29 , who works as a university teaching assistant			1
" @entity1 is going through a lot of change and street art is the perfect medium to experiment in			1
@entity29 began experimenting with graffiti about six months ago and is one of a small but growing number of street artists in the kingdom			1
a blog , @entity45 , displays some of their work			2
" it 's something very new here , " she said			2
" i started with very random shapes but i wanted to develop more techniques that people could relate to			2
" you do n't see a lot of street art here , there 's just vandalism			1
i 'm excited to be doing something new			0
" i like street art because it 's there for the people			1
you do n't need to overdo your ideas , it 's a simple way of expressing yourself			0
and it 's free , which you do n't see in many forms of art. " @entity29 sprayed her @entity6 sign on walls around the historic area of @entity0 where it would be seen by as many passing people as possible			0
" i did n't want it to be a beautiful artwork , i wanted to create debate , " she said			0
she was pleased with the response it received			0
" people took photos and shared them on @entity82 and @entity83 , " she said			0
" some people related to it because it was straight to the point ; other people did n't care			0
it 's interesting to hear the different views every time someone comes up and asks me if i did it			0
" @entity29 is also gaining recognition			1
she was one of four artists chosen to exhibit at an off shoot of the edge of @entity1 show , the first major contemporary art exhibition in @entity1 , according to its organizers			1
in a country where a lot of culture is controlled by the government , @entity29 is one of growing number of young rebels finding their own way of pushing boundaries			1
stand - up comedy is another art form gaining popularity just out of government reach			1
there are no comedy clubs and live shows are rare , but comedians are gaining a following through their own shows on @entity120			1
@entity121 hosts a satirical news show called " @entity123			1
" it goes out monthly on @entity120 and episodes are watched online by hundreds of thousands of people			1
" if we create our own entertainment , we preserve our culture , " @entity121 said			2
" we are no longer reliant on culture that comes from abroad			2
" we reflect something that 's happening in our community in a comical manner and it 's up to you to decide what 's right and wrong			0
" while pushing gently at social boundaries -- such as women 's rights -- the comedians say they self - censor , avoiding taboo topics like religion and the monarchy			1
@entity1 is ruled by the @entity145 family , much of whose power to rule comes from its association with the @entity150 religious establishment			1
@entity151 is an austere form of @entity153 that has been a major social and political force in the kingdom			2
" if you self - censor , it 's the best way to do this media that 's accepted by our society , because our society , they want to be entertained but they do n't want you to cross boundaries or taboos , " said @entity121			2
" we are not breaking anything			0
we are speaking , that 's it , " said fellow comedian @entity166			0
" there 's stuff you can say without crossing any red lines			0
" journalist and satirist @entity172 , who launched his own satirical news show two years ago , says he wants to create debate you ca n't see elsewhere			2
" the problem with traditional media is they tell you want to think about a certain issue , " he said			0
" i do n't want to drag that with me into new media			0
i want people to look at a news headline and think twice about what it means			2
" but he too is wary			0
people have been arrested for work they post on social media			0
" there 's always a margin of concern , " @entity172 added			0
" we are always afraid , not of doing something wrong , but being understood in the wrong way			0
" one @entity1 blogger , who asked not to be named , said young people find subtle ways around government control			1
" a lot of cultural events are organized by the government , and the government puts a lot of restrictions on what can be done , " he said			2
" for culture to thrive , you need people who will push boundaries and that does n't happen in a government - controlled environment			1
" he said that young people can go to gigs or live comedy , provided organizers promote them discreetly and avoid official attention			0
" often it 's a gray area , where it 's not quite legal but not totally secret			0
invitations may go out on @entity82 and instructions for how to buy tickets or where to go will be kept private until the day before			0
