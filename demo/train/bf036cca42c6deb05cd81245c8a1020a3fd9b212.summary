@entity0 -- for anyone arriving in @entity4 , it 's obvious that the country is having a big , big party			1
there are @entity11 flags across the streets , bunting hangs from building to building and , in the stores , the shelves are crammed full of jubilee memorabilia			1
it 's 115 years since @entity4 celebrated a diamond jubilee			1
the last monarch -- indeed the only previous monarch -- to have celebrated 60 years on the throne was @entity20 's great - great grandmother @entity18			1
there were huge celebrations back in 1897 as the queen rode through her capital in front of thousands of loyal subjects cheering her every inch of the way			1
on the queen 's schedule that day was a trip to @entity33 for a service of thanksgiving			2
she was too frail to climb the steps outside @entity38 's great masterpiece , so instead the queen stayed in her carriage while the clergy and congregation came outside for the service			2
spool on to 2012 and at her service of thanksgiving , @entity20 will stop exactly where @entity18 's carriage came to a halt			1
this time though , the monarch will walk up the steps and make it into the cathedral			0
live blog : @entity54 , june 3 it was n't until 1935 that the @entity4 saw its next jubilee			1
as war clouds gathered over @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity57 celebrated their @entity61 to mark 25 years on the throne			2
again , there were celebrations in @entity0 , around @entity4 and across the @entity65			1
by the time of @entity20 's @entity61 in 1977 , much was different			1
deference to royalty had been replaced by respect and , in truth , some indifference			0
@entity4 colonial rule was almost gone : some newly independent countries kept the queen as head of state while others ditched her altogether in favor of a president			1
but most of these nations opted to join the @entity82 , a club of countries all tied through history to the @entity4 and the monarchy			1
bumming a smoke from the queen : when the security bubble bursts what had n't changed much though was way the @entity90 showed their affection that year for their sovereign			1
hundreds of thousands of people filled the streets of @entity0 to cheer the queen as she toured her capital , while millions more folks , including a 10 - year - old me , took part in street parties up and down the land			1
it was the first jubilee in which i was actively involved			2
i remember doing projects at school about the royal family and also receiving my @entity61 coin			0
the @entity61 was the first time i 'd ever seen the queen : in fact it was the first time i 'd ever seen any of the royal family			2
when her majesty came to my home town in northern @entity117 , i was part of a boys choir that sang for her			0
i can still remember part of the song -- but probably ca n't reach the high notes these days			0
how the world has changed in queen 's reign the @entity127 10 years ago marked the 50th anniversary of the queen 's accession			1
it was an amazing event which , for me , holds so many wonderful memories			0
by then i 'd become a journalist			0
in that capacity , i went to different parts of the country covering the queen 's visits			2
i saw the extraordinary warmth with which she was greeting by so many of her subjects			0
and i was privileged to work on two concerts held for the queen in her garden at @entity145			2
the lineup read like a " @entity147 " of music from the previous 50 years			0
not everything went according to plan though			0
i was in the palace garden talking to the musician @entity152 when security staff came charging out of the building , telling us there was a fire			0
surely this is n't going to be a repeat of the @entity161 fire in 1992 we thought -- and over the jubilee weekend as well ? thankfully , it turned out to be very small and caused minimal damage to some staff quarters -- but it was a heartstopping few minutes			1
another abiding memory of 2002 was meeting the queen and being corrected on my @entity117			2
i was introduced to her majesty at @entity161			0
her presence in a room full of people was huge , even though she 's only 5 feet 4 inches tall			0
as we chatted , i thanked her for agreeing to change her schedule by a few minutes on one of her regional visits to help accommodate television coverage			0
unfortunately , i used the @entity180 pronunciation " skedule			0
" looking back , i still wonder how on earth i could have dropped such a clanger			0
at least the queen was smiling as she set me straight ! spin on another 10 years to the @entity184			0
there 's huge excitement in @entity4			1
of course there are those who do n't really care about the event and a small number of people who would rather there was no monarchy at all			1
but with the queen 's popularity riding high , there 's no doubt that people up and down the land will be joining in the festivities			2
in small villages , medium - sized towns and big cities , the jubilee buzz will be everywhere			1
and in @entity0 , expect to see more than a million people on the streets as the queen tours the city in her carriage			1
of course , a big royal event like this would n't be complete without the balcony appearance -- and that wave , so uniquely royal			0
this will be the moment when people show how proud they are to have @entity20 as their head of state			1
she 's a symbol of continuity and stability in a fast - changing world			0
in times good and bad , the @entity4 look to their royal family			2
when she was 21 , she made a broadcast in which she promised to devote the rest of her life to serving the people			0
now it 's the people 's turn to acknowledge her contribution and say thank you			0
during this jubilee weekend , millions of people will sing the @entity4 national anthem , " @entity236			1
" and when they do , they 'll really mean it			0
are you going or celebrating the @entity54 in your own way ? let us know how in the comments !			2
