@entity0 -- on friday morning , a man walked through the entrance of an elementary school and , without warning , began ruthlessly cutting down children at the school			1
before he was subdued , nearly two dozen were hit			0
while it sounds like the horrific massacre in @entity11 , this attack took place about 8,000 miles away in central @entity13			1
and while several of the victims were reported in critical condition , none of the 22 children were killed			1
the 36 - year - old suspect in @entity13 -- which has strict gun control laws -- attacked the children with a knife , according to local reports			1
" the huge difference between this case and the @entity29 is not the suspect , nor the situation , but the simple fact he did not have an effective weapon , " said dr. @entity24 , a @entity25 - educated sociologist at the @entity26 in @entity0			1

police : 20 children among 26 victims of @entity48 shooting " in terms of the @entity29 , there 's much easier availability of killing instruments -- rifles , machine guns , explosives -- than in nearly every other developed country , " dr. @entity24 said			2
" in the @entity29 , we had 9,000 people killed with guns last year , in similar countries like @entity62 170 ( killed with guns ) , in @entity64 150			2
there 's a reason for that , " rep. @entity65 , @entity67 - @entity66 , told @entity1 's @entity68			2
" the proof in the pudding is that in every other industrialized nation except the @entity29 , they have reasonable gun control laws , and they have hundreds of people killed each year -- not 9,000 or 10,000 a year -- killed by guns			1
" analysis : why gun controls are off the agenda in @entity29 the @entity29 has , by far , the highest rate of gun ownership in the world , with 88.8 guns per 100 people , followed by @entity86 ( 58.2 ) , @entity87 ( 54.8 ) and @entity89 / @entity88 ( 45.7 each ) , according to @entity90 , an international database at the @entity92			1
