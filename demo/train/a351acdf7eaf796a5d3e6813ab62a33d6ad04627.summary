@entity0 -- the @entity4 @entity3 leadership upped the ante thursday in the ongoing debate over the size and scope of the federal budget , unveiling a proposal to cut spending by $ 375 billion over the next five years			1
@entity4 @entity3 minority whip @entity12 has been an outspoken critic of @entity14 budget proposals			0
the bulk of the @entity3 's proposed savings would come from capping nondefense discretionary spending at the level of inflation			1
among other things , the @entity3 proposal would also create a government spending review commission and eliminate retirement payments for federal workers who retire before the age of 62			1
president @entity34 " challenged us to come up with budget savings , and today @entity4 @entity3 encourage him to not only look over our proposed ... common - sense taxpayer savings , but to join our effort , " @entity26 @entity12 , @entity27 , said in a statement			2
" for the sake of our young people and @entity39 's long - term fiscal viability , @entity35 simply can not keep spending money that the president himself admits we do n't have			0
" @entity34 asked congressional republicans to propose new budget reductions during an april 24 meeting at the @entity4			0
in may , the administration proposed $ 17 billion in cuts from the more than $ 3.4 trillion in spending approved for next year			1
