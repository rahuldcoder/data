@entity0 , @entity1 -- an international sports icon is behind bars			1
and @entity1 is grappling with one of its most notorious killings in recent memory			1
olympic runner @entity10 , known as @entity10 for his lightning - fast prosthetic legs , shook and sobbed friday when a judge officially charged him with killing his girlfriend on @entity13			1
wearing a dark suit , he buried his head in his hands at a packed courtroom in @entity0			1
prosecutors said they plan to charge the 26 - year - old with premeditated murder			1
@entity10 rejects the murder allegation " in the strongest terms , " his agent , @entity21 , told @entity2			1
his girlfriend , model @entity24 , was found in a pool of blood at @entity10 ' home thursday in an upscale neighborhood in the capital			1
neighbors alerted authorities to the early morning shooting , saying they had " heard things earlier , " according to police spokeswoman @entity34			1
she did not clarify what the neighbors reported they heard			1
the track star was arrested the same day			1
@entity24 's killing rattled @entity1 , not only for the fame factor , but also because the country is grappling with a disturbing problem -- 71 % of women report that they 've been the victim of sexual abuse			1
just in the past few weeks , 17 - year - old @entity46 died after being gang - raped and mutilated in the tiny tourist town of @entity48 , two hours southeast of @entity49			2
@entity46 's death inspired this week 's nationwide rape awareness day dubbed @entity52			2
the day before she was killed , @entity24 retweeted a message on @entity54 in support of @entity52			2
while police have not discussed a possible motive for the model 's killing , local media reported that @entity10 had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder			1
@entity1 has a high crime rate , and many homeowners keep weapons to protect themselves from intruders			2
but @entity34 , the police spokeswoman , stressed that this scenario did not come from authorities			2
there was no evidence of forced entry at the home , she said			2
police said there had been previous " allegations of a domestic nature " at his house , but they did not elaborate			2
investigators found a pistol at the scene			2
@entity1 's gun debate on a larger stage , @entity24 's killing has given gun control advocates a spotlight to push for stricter laws			2
@entity89 says there are just under 6 million licensed firearms in @entity1 , a country of 50 million people			2
" there are 1.5 million gun owners -- about 3.5 million guns in civilians hands , " said @entity93 , chairman of @entity94			2
most of the victims of gun homicides are between the ages 20 and 30 , he said			2
@entity1 has passed tough legislation that includes a requirement for a thorough background check for prospective gun owners			0
the check includes spouses and partners , and is repeated every few years , he said			0
watch : police probe shooting at @entity10 home " people acquire guns believing they are more safe ... but they place themselves at great risk , " @entity93 said			1
" we 've made airplanes a gun - free zone			0
we need to bring that logic down to earth			0
" but the @entity1 @entity119 , a popular gun lobby group , has said citizens have the right to protect themselves from increasingly violent crimes			0
" there are already more than enough laws and regulations to control the possession of firearms by private citizens , " it says on its website			0
" fewer and less complex laws reasonably , yet properly , applied could achieve the required objective			0
" one issue in @entity1 is stolen guns			0
guns are often stolen from home , reports show , but also from the police			0
statistics suggest that 18,196 police firearms have been lost or stolen during the five - year period beginning april 1 2005 to march 31 2011			0
from hero to murder suspect beyond the violence , @entity1 struggled with the idea that they 've lost a hero , an athlete who embodied what it meant to overcome incredible physical odds			1
when @entity10 was a toddler , his legs were amputated below the knees because of a bone defect			1
earning the nickname " @entity10 , " @entity10 runs on special carbon fiber blades			1
he became the first @entity157 sprinter competing against able - bodied athletes at the @entity159 last year			0
his face became a fixture on billboards across the nation , and he and @entity24 were photographed at high - profile celebrity events and around town			0
hours after the news of his arrest , some of the billboards started coming down			0
his sponsors also pulled away			0
@entity170 removed an ad featuring him from its website showing him taking off for a run with the words " i am the bullet in the chamber			1
" other @entity10 sponsors -- including prosthetics manufacturer @entity178 , @entity180 , and @entity181 , which makes sunglasses and other products -- expressed condolences and said they had no further comment			1
the sports icon appeared in headlines across the nation , overshadowing the @entity190 address by president @entity191			0
" golden boy loses shine , " read a headline on the front page of the @entity194			0
the @entity0 court postponed @entity10 ' bail hearing to tuesday and ordered him to remain in custody until then			1
prosecutors said they will argue that he committed premeditated murder			1
authorities said they will oppose bail , but did not provide their reasons for the decision			0
he shattered barriers the double amputee 's @entity159 appearance brought controversy , as some said the prosthetic limbs gave him an advantage			0
@entity10 was initially refused permission to enter the @entity159 , but he hired a legal team to prove that his artificial limbs did not give him an unfair advantage , and he was allowed to compete			1
while he did not win a medal , his presence on the track was lauded as an example of victory over adversity and dedication to a goal			0
in the 2012 paralympics , held a few weeks after the @entity159 , he smashed a record to win the men 's 400 - meter in the final athletics event of the @entity229			0
in october , he discussed the " massive blessing " of inspiring people around the world			0
" being an international sportsman , there 's a lot of responsibility that comes with that , " he told @entity2 's " @entity238			0
" @entity239 : the career of @entity10 @entity2 's @entity241 reported from @entity0 , and @entity242 and @entity243 from @entity244			1
