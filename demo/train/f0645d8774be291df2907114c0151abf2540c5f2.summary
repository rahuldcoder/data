@entity0 -- @entity3 's recent arrests and alleged pot - smoking antics on an airplane raise the question : who 's in charge ? can parents stand a chance of keeping their kid in line if he 's a highly paid teen celebrity ? @entity1 interviewed two celebrity parents and two professionals who help young stars after they crash about why parenthood is perhaps the toughest role in @entity18			1
they point to predators , parasites and parents who do n't act like parents as culprits			1
parents ca n't be pals @entity3 and his dad seem to be best buddies			1
they even have matching tattoos			0
@entity30 , 38 , was with his son during several of the incidents that have brought him legal trouble in the past weeks			0
father and son were partying together in @entity36 , @entity37 , before the younger @entity3 , 19 , was arrested on a drunken driving charge			0
the elder @entity3 was with his son the night he allegedly assaulted a @entity40 limousine driver			0
a @entity42 report said @entity30 and @entity3 were both flying on a chartered jet when the pilots had to put on oxygen masks after marijuana smoke filled the cabin			0
" you have the parents acting as a child with them , " said dr. @entity48 , a former child actor who helps celebrities detox in rehab			1
" this enables their addictions and contributes to their spiral downward , as with @entity3 and @entity58			0
" @entity58 's father , who runs an addiction treatment facility in @entity37 , said he would never party with his daughter			0
@entity62 has been publicly critical of his ex-wife for doing that			1
" you ca n't socialize with your kids , " @entity62 said			1
" you ca n't attend events and party with them			1
" @entity58 missed out on some of his daughter 's childhood when he served prison time in connection with a @entity77 insider trading investigation			0
he also had his own substance abuse issues , which were addressed in rehab			1
the parent of another successful young actress -- who at age 20 has never been in trouble -- replied " oh , hell no ! " when asked if she would ever party with her daughter			1
" you ca n't party with your kid , " she said			1
" you have to keep your position as a parent			1
" she asked to remain anonymous so as not to embarrass her daughter			0
@entity91 is the founder and ceo of @entity93 , the rehab facility where @entity58 was treated last year			1
he cites a " truism that never changes			0
" " when parents raise their children with a healthy boundary and recognize that they are not to be this child 's friend , but to be their parent , what happens is , these children grow up to be well - adjusted , " @entity91 said			1
" we look at them as stars , but the reality is they are still children , and children crave boundaries			1
if you 're going to be their friend primarily , and you just happen to be a parent , then do n't be shocked when your children grow up with social adjustment issues			1
" unnatural role reversal parents of a young star often leave their own jobs to travel with their children as they make movies or perform on concert tours			1
" the parent can no longer work because they run around with them , and sometimes the kids realize that and it 's unnatural , " the previously quoted mother said			1
" they let the kid turn wild because they feel guilty , because they are not working			0
" a mother is needed to do things the manager or agent wo n't do , such as helping them study scripts and run lines with them between scenes , she said			1
" no agent does that			0
" but even if parents keep their own careers , their child 's income can far exceed their own			1
this role reversal can leave a parent powerless to enforce rules			2
" it 's hard for the parent to have control when the kid knows they 're making more money than them , " she said			2
" if he wants to go to a party , he 's going to use that			0
" this mother shared the story of another parent who put her foot down when her 16 - year - old actress daughter refused to clean up her bedroom			1
the teen suggested the maid could do it			0
the mom called the producer of her hit tv series and told him the actress would not be showing that day until she cleaned her room			0
the producer agreed to shoot around the young actress that day			0
the daughter cleaned the room after that , she said			0
it 's a move many parents are afraid of making , out of fear it could cost their child work in the future			2
" parents afraid to upset the system , " the mother said			1
no one to say ' no ' " these kids need structure , " @entity48 said			2
they need to be told ' no '			0
sometimes the parents are missing , emotionally abandoning them , being too involved in their own lives			2
there is no one to say ' no ' if your parent ca n't say ' no ' to you			1
" @entity3 needs " someone who is willing to piss him off , " the actress 's mother said			2
" a good parent has to do that			2
" it 's something she does regularly with her daughter , even though she 's now legally an adult			0
" it 's no secret -- we battle , " she said			0
@entity62 said it is " important to steer them into the right direction " about who they should associate with , but it is " hard to control that			1
" it 's the " parasites that come around them " at night that cause problems , he said			2
another problem is that the bodyguards -- who are suppose to protect them -- party with them and help to cover it up , @entity58 said			0
momagers and predators when a performer turns 18 in @entity231 , he or she is handed the checkbook to the trust fund where 15 % of their earnings have been deposited under the state 's " @entity236			1
" the law was written to protect them from the fate of @entity241 , who made a fortune as a child actor in silent films , but his parents spent the money before he became an adult			2
these 18 - year - olds are also given the freedom make their own business decisions			1
it 's almost a ritual for managers , agents , lawyers and publicists to approach them with the advice that they ditch their parents as advisers , the actress 's mother said			1
" when they are almost 18 , they have secret lunches and they tell your kids ' you need to leave your parents , ' " she said			1
" the parents have no power then			2
" her own daughter only told her a year later that her manager " took her to lunch and said she needed to get away from mom , " she said			2
" the agents turned because i was putting pressure on them , because they did n't have a plan for her at 17 and 18 , " the mother said			1
" when you make them do their job , then you become the enemy			0
" @entity62 told a similar story about his daughter when she was almost 18 and making the movie " @entity287			1
" @entity3 's mom : ' he 's just @entity3 to me ' @entity3 's mother @entity291 told @entity1 's @entity292 in a 2012 interview that she " did n't want him even to know it was an option " to be in the entertainment industry			1
however , it was his mother who first put his videos on @entity301 , which led to his discovery by manager @entity304			2
she moved with him from @entity305 to @entity306 where @entity304 launched @entity3 's remarkable career			0
" parenting him is , i think , like anybody parenting a child , " @entity291 told @entity308 a year ago			2
" we just have a different set of circumstances			0
it does n't affect me at all			2
his lifestyle has different circumstances that we have to work around , but he 's just @entity3 to me			0
" @entity291 told @entity318 that she 's always been protective of her son			0
" you hear all the horror stories about kids and teenagers in this industry , and i did n't want to throw my son to the wolves			1
i 've done my best to protect him and surround him with good people			0
" @entity329 : ' i 'd pull him close ' first lady @entity329 , mother of two girls , was asked by @entity334 host @entity333 on friday what she would do if @entity3 was her son			2
" i 'd pull him close , " @entity329 said			0
" i do n't know if it would be advice as much as action			2
i would be very present in his life right now and i would be probably with him a good chunk of the time , just there to talk , to figure out what 's going on in his head , to figure out who 's in his life and who 's not			0
" her daughters " just want me near , they want that advice from a parent , " she said			2
" they want to see you on a daily basis			0
" @entity91 's suggestion for @entity3 does not involve his parents			0
he should have a talk with the @entity3 of 15 years from now			0
" what he has to do is have a moment of truth and sit down and recognize that his 35 - year - old self would be bitch - slapping him right now , " the rehab owner said			1
@entity3 also should find " the best , top notch therapist he humanely , possibly can in the industry , who is desensitized to who he is , " @entity91 said .			0

predators , parasites and parents who do n't act like parents are culprits
@entity62 : " you ca n't socialize with your kids "
managers , agents try to separate 18 - year - old stars from their parents , mother says
" there is no one to say ' no ' if your parent ca n't say ' no ' to you , " rehab *doctor* says
