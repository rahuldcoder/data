-- if the @entity2 is serious about thoroughly defeating @entity3 , it must -- somehow , some way -- go through @entity4			1
but how ? and in what way ? those are the big questions now , as president @entity7 weighs what to do inside the war - ravaged nation where @entity3 leaders are based and where the @entity13 terror group rose to prominence			1
@entity7 ceded thursday that " we do n't have a strategy yet " for what to do about @entity3 inside @entity4 , with a senior administration official adding that a decision is " a week or so " away			1
there are certainly options , but none is clear - cut			0
" there is no such thing as a no - risk strategy , " said rep. @entity23 , @entity24			1
" it 's a matter of taking the right risk and balancing that risk to make the right choice			2
" here 's a look at some possibilities , including why and how they could and could not work : 1 ) ground forces in other words , go all in			1
when terrorists attacked on september 11 , 2001 , the @entity2 showed its willingness to use its full military might when it attacked @entity39 -- a campaign that dragged on for years and killed more than 2,300 @entity2 troops			1
that steep cost , both human and financial , is the big reason this is very , very unlikely to happen again in @entity4			2
no @entity2 officials have suggested troops on the ground			1
the fact none were sent to fight in @entity50 -- a country where the @entity2 has deeper ties and a government it works with -- is further indication there will be no @entity2 ground invasion of @entity4 anytime soon			1
there could be smaller - scale , targeted operations , though			0
after all , @entity61 spokesman rear adm. @entity60 told @entity0 that , this summer , elite @entity2 commandos from units like @entity64 and @entity65 went into @entity4 and tried to rescue @entity2 journalist @entity66 and others held by @entity69 militants			1
they did n't find hostages , but who 's to say @entity71 could n't conduct more such missions to save others or for some other purpose ? then there 's the possibility @entity2 troops could go into @entity4 to help with the targeting of @entity2 airstrikes			1
of course , all bets are off if @entity3 pulls an @entity82 and strikes inside the @entity2			1
that has n't happened yet , though some experts believe that such an attack from @entity3 -- which , upon beheading @entity66 , warned other @entity2 citizens could be next -- might be a matter of time			1
2 ) @entity90 @entity7 gave the go - ahead to pound @entity3 forces in @entity50 from the air			1
why not do the same in @entity4 , a country the president himself ceded thursday has become a " safe haven " for the terror group ? except it 's not that simple			1
it starts with the fact that @entity4 is a mess			2
three years of civil war have torn apart the country , spurring the emergence of rebel groups fighting to oust president @entity107 and sometimes against each other			0
about the only thing @entity107 and rebel groups have in common is that @entity3 is their enemy			1
@entity7 is pushing to get @entity107 too , but they 're on the same side when it comes to @entity3			1
yet @entity2 officials insist this shared cause does n't mean they 'll coordinate any military action with @entity107 's government , even if @entity120 officials are demanding it			1
it 's one thing to anger @entity4 even more			1
it 's another thing to anger its allies @entity124 and @entity125			2
@entity125 , which is already at odds with the @entity127 over @entity128 , could block any @entity130 effort to give a seal of approval to international strikes			0
all of this brings many questions : does the @entity2 really want to conduct a military campaign in a country without a government that is stable and that it trusts ? can it count on opposition factions it supports to provide any long - term stability ? and does it know that airstrikes will wipe out @entity3 in @entity4 rather than stalling the group ? absent a fortune - teller , it 's hard to tell how any military action would turn out			1
still , if @entity7 decides that 's the way to go now , @entity147 spokesman @entity146 stressed , more needs to be done politically , diplomatically and economically long - term to keep @entity3 down			1
" any sort of strategy that 's predicated only on the use of @entity2 military force will not be an enduring solution , " he said			1
3 ) support factions in @entity4 to fight @entity3 the @entity7 administration frequently touts its support for " moderate opposition " battling both @entity107 's forces and @entity3			1
yet , for all its talk , it has n't directly armed such forces			0
the ideal is , if you arm groups like the @entity167 , they can help take out @entity3			2
that may not be realistic , considering @entity3 with the @entity120 government may be the most powerful forces now in the nation			2
then there 's the real possibility that if moderate forces lose , @entity2 weaponry may end up in the hands of @entity3 , as has happened in @entity50			1
still , it helps to have someone local you trust to provide on - the - ground intelligence for airstrikes or compliment those strikes with a ground assault			2
@entity23 , the @entity184 ' ranking member on the @entity185 , is among those who believes " @entity2 military might alone is not going to contain @entity3			1
we are going to need partners locally			0
" " we have to strengthen them , not so much so they can win , " @entity23 said of the @entity4 movement , " but so that they can survive and maintain some territory to give us a partner to work with			1
" 4 ) cut off @entity3 's funding if you ca n't pound @entity3 into submission militarily , the reasoning goes , you can hit it where it hurts : the wallet			2
the thinking goes that , in order to wage war , you need weapons , vehicles , ammunition			0
in order to govern a country , you need access to food , water and electricity			0
and usually to address these needs , a group needs money			0
implementing sanctions and freezing bank accounts are often the first , least controversial steps to go after a terrorist group			0
and they can have an impact , but they also have their limits			0
for one , one should n't think such efforts will be effective overnight			0
they take time to coordinate , and it takes time to drain militants ' piggy banks			0
plus , it 's not like there 's a readily available list of @entity3 donors to go after			2
and the fact is , @entity3 is n't like many other terror groups			2
unlike others like @entity82 , it 's chief goal is as practical as it is ideological : to take over and govern territory			0
already , @entity3 has proven adept at seizing weaponry			0
it 's also paid attention to things like food stocks , electricity , sewage , medical care and more , as a recent @entity249 article noted			0
" they are in this for the long haul , " rep. @entity250 , @entity251 , said			0
" they are trying to structure themselves in a way that they can hold and expand their holdings			0
" whether its government is effective or not , one thing @entity3 has proven is its zealousness for the cause and willingness to sacrifice civilians who have n't believed in it from the beginning			2
5 ) build a true international coalition one big thing the @entity2 has going for it : practically no one likes @entity3			1
sure , there are groups and individuals backing the formation of an @entity272 -- which is what @entity3 calls itself now that it controls a vast swath of @entity4 and @entity50 -- governed by sharia law			1
some from oil - rich @entity277 states in the @entity279 may bankroll the group ; others fight , with @entity2 attorney general @entity282 this summer estimating that there are 7,000 such foreigners with militant groups in @entity4			1
" there are clearly two camps in the world today : those who believe that sovereignty and supremacy in the world belongs to @entity296 , they are the @entity272 , ( and ) those who believe sovereignty belongs to man , " said @entity287 firebrand preacher @entity286 , who sides with the @entity272			0
yet @entity3 has far , far more detractors than supporters			0
it has a bloody track record of beheadings , crucifixions , stonings , not to mention the widespread slaughtering of minorities , @entity309 and @entity69 who do n't prescribe to its strict interpretation of @entity69			0
such actions -- like @entity66 's execution -- spurred widespread condemnation			0
some have incentive to go beyond condemnation and act , militarily , against @entity3			0
start with nations that border @entity4 , like @entity318 and @entity319			0
as its self - ordained caliphate shows , @entity3 has shown that it does n't abide by national borders			2
what 's to stop it from advancing into another country , especially if it gets bigger , stronger and richer ? that possibility might spur other countries , besides the @entity2 , to step in sooner rather than later			1
even if they do n't neighbor @entity50 or @entity4 , nations with significant populations of @entity334 -- which is the sect of most @entity69 worldwide , including in @entity279 nations like @entity337 and @entity338 -- may have reason to worry			0
like with @entity82 previously , disaffected young @entity69 anywhere -- even in the @entity127 -- could join @entity3 , then perhaps deciding to act out in their homelands			0
" it 's certainly not in the interest of governments in that neighborhood to have ( @entity3 ) wreaking havoc or perpetrating terrible acts of violence , " said @entity146 , the @entity147 spokesman			2
these nations could band together			0
the @entity2 could be part of this coalition , perhaps letting others take an equal or greater role in military operations			2
the idea of @entity357 leading " from behind " has precedent : look at @entity360			0
this international coalition got what it wanted with the downfall of dictator @entity364			0
but years later , @entity360 is not a model of anything good : beset by warring militias and without an effective central government			0
@entity250 , the @entity369 chairman , thinks the @entity7 administration has had " no real strategy " on @entity3 so far -- especially a strategy that addresses the group 's base in @entity4 -- even though the group 's been growing stronger for years			1
" we 're so far along into this , " the @entity375 said of @entity3 's rise			2
" it 's not like this happened just last week			0

@entity7 : @entity2 has no military strategy yet on what to do against @entity3 in @entity4
there 's been no hint of ground forces , but commandos did do a rescue mission
airstrikes are a possibility ; a *congressman* says it 's *critical* @entity2 work with locals
" there is no such thing as a no - risk strategy , " rep. @entity23 adds
