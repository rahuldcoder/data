-- @entity1 have reacted to their slump to the bottom of the @entity4 by announcing that coach @entity5 has been relieved of his duties			1
@entity5 has paid the ultimate price for @entity1 's dismal start to the @entity4 season			1
@entity1 's 5 - 1 defeat to @entity11 , a result which left them rooted to the foot of the table , was their sixth consecutive league reverse			1
the club were also knocked out of the @entity18 by second division @entity19 last week and were held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity22 side @entity21 in their opening @entity25 group fixture 10 days ago			1

@entity1 were even still in the race for the @entity4 title with two games of the season remaining			2
however , the loss of key players @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53 this summer and the failure to find adequate replacements has contributed to a terrible start to the season which has cost the @entity58 his job			0
