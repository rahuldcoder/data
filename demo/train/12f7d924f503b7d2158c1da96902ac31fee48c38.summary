-- at the 1964 @entity2 , people stood in line for hours to look at a strange sight			1
if only the future looked like " @entity6 , " with its nifty gadgets that seem to solve every problem			1
they wanted to see the " @entity10 , " a miniaturized replica of a typical 21st century @entity13 city that featured moving sidewalks , computer - guided cars zipping along congestion - free highways and resort hotels beneath the sea			2
forty years later , we 're still waiting for those congestion - free highways -- along with the jet pack , the paperless office and all those " @entity6 " - like gadgets that were supposed to make 21st - century life so easy			2
@entity25 has been waiting as well			2
he 's looked at the future we imagined for ourselves in pulp comic books , old science magazines and cheesy sci - fi movies from the 1950s , and came up with one question			1
why is n't the future what it used to be ? " i feel entitled to have all this technology that 's been promised at a certain time , " says @entity25 , author of " where 's my jetpack ? " " i look up and say , ' where 's all this stuff ? ' '' some of that futuristic stuff , it turns out , is already here			1
visionaries actually invented objects like flying cars , but they could never work out the real world applications , @entity25 says			1
other inventions had the same problem			1
ordinary people did n't want to have anything to do with them			1
these futuristic follies include everything from " @entity51 , " an invention that helped moviegoers smell as well as see movies ; @entity56 's " ultrasonic ultra-squeaky clean human washing machine " ( it was dubbed the " human washing machine , " but would n't fit in an ordinary bathroom ) and , of course , the jet pack			2
" scientists are ok at predicting what technology is going to happen in the future , " @entity25 says			1
" they 're really bad at predicting how it 's going to affect us			2
" what happened to my jet pack ? the jet pack is a perfect example of predicting the future , @entity25 says			1
he says the jet pack first appeared in 1928 in an @entity74 comic book , which featured the hero @entity75 zooming though the sky in a jet pack			2
the jet pack was actually developed by 1961 , @entity25 says			2
an inventor mounted a rocket onto a backpack and called it a rocket belt			2
a variation of the rocket belt even appeared in the 1965 @entity86 movie , " @entity87			2
" today , the jet pack continues to grab inventors ' imaginations			2
a daredevil wearing a jet pack flew across a 1,500 - foot - wide canyon in @entity94 in november			2
a @entity96 pilot , dubbed " @entity97 , " flew across the @entity98 last year using a single jet - propelled wing			2
and a @entity101 inventor recently invented a jet pack , which weighs about 250 pounds , that reportedly can run for 30 minutes			0
the jet pack , though , has never really taken off , @entity25 says			0
the problem is its practical application			0
while a rocket belt could propel a screaming human to 60 mph in seconds , its fuel lasted for only about half a minute , " which led to more screaming , " @entity25 says			0
the military could n't find a useful application for it either			0
a soldier with a jet pack might look cool , but he 's an easy target			0
nor could a jet pack be of use to ordinary people who wanted to avoid rush - hour traffic , @entity25 says			1
jet - packing hordes could transform the skies into an aerial demolition derby , with air rage and drunk drivers turned into wobbly human torpedoes			0
yet other bold visions of the future have come true			1
remember @entity130 the robot ? that was the name of the robotic maid that waited on the @entity135 , the popular cartoon family from the future			1
@entity130 has become " @entity138			0
" that 's the name of a 3 - foot - tall robot with a goofy grin that the @entity143 conglomerate in @entity144 invented to assist elderly people at home by doing everything from reminding them to take their medicine to looking out for burglars			1
wakamaru can recognize faces and up to 10,000 words , @entity25 says			0
" @entity156 , " is a tagline from another television show , " @entity6 "			1
but teleportation has been invented , @entity25 says			0
he says a group of international scientists successfully transported a photon -- a bundle of electromagnetic energy -- from one side of a room to another in 1993			0
physicists routinely conduct teleportation experiments today , @entity25 says			0
" teleporting anything , even elementary particles , is mind - blowing , " @entity25 says			0
" why is it that most people do n't know it exists ? it has n't been put into practice yet			1
in real life , it 's always about , ' what can you do for me ? ' " a darker view of technology 's future people 's fascination with technology 's imprint on the future did n't start , however , in the mid- 20th century with shows like " @entity135 " or " @entity6			1
" @entity190 , co-author of " yesterday 's tomorrows : past @entity201 , " found an inflated optimism about technology 's impact on the future as far back as the 19th century , when writers like @entity197 ( " @entity198 " ) were creating wondrous versions of the future			1
even then , people had a misplaced faith in the power of inventions to make life easier , @entity190 says			1
for example , the typical 19th - century @entity13 city was crowded and smelly			0
they created traffic jams , filled the streets with their droppings and , when they died , their carcasses			0
but around the turn of the 20th century , @entity13 were predicting that another miraculous invention would deliver them from the burden of the horse and hurried urban life -- the automobile , @entity190 says			0
" there were a lot of predictions associated with early automobiles , " @entity190 says			0
" they would help eliminate congestion in the city and the messy , unsanitary streets of the city			0
" @entity190 says @entity13 ' faith in the power of technology to reshape the future is due in part to their history			1
@entity13 have never accepted a radical political transformation that would change their future			1
they prefer technology , not radical politics , to propel social change			0
" technology has been seen by many @entity13 as a way to get a better tomorrow without having to deal with revolutionary change , " @entity190 says			0
today , however , a more sober view of technology has sneaked into the nation 's popular culture			0
in dystopian sci - fi films like " @entity251 , " and " @entity252 , " technology creates more problems than it solves			0
" @entity255 , '' the recent television series , is a prime example			1
it depicts a world where human beings have created amazing technology that has brought them to the precipice of extinction			0
there 's no @entity75 zooming blissfully through the sky			0
the show follows the journey of a group of humans who created a race of robots called @entity271			0
the @entity273 rebel , virtually wipe out humanity with nuclear weapons , and pursue the survivors through space			0
@entity278 , a @entity255 writer , says the show 's writers pay attention to current events when plotting their story lines			1
the contemporary world is filled with the unintended consequences of technology , he says			0
" there are so many things you ca n't anticipate when you create a new technology , " he says			0
" who would have predicted that the @entity292 would be taking down shopping malls and wiping out newspapers ? '' in @entity255 's finale , human beings abandon their faith in technology 's ability to improve the future			1
they destroy their fancy machines and start again as simple hunter - gatherers			1
" at some point , you ca n't expect a miracle to come in the form of technology to save us , " @entity278 says			1
" at some point , the miracle has to come from a change in attitude and a new outlook			1
" that does n't mean , however , that @entity278 is n't a fan of imagining future technology			1
he says he grew up watching " @entity6 " and immersing himself in @entity10 - like exhibits			0
the elevated cities and the " @entity6 " voyages of yesteryear may now seem corny , but at least they show humanity has a future , he says			1
" ' @entity6 ' was saying [ that ] a thousand years from now , people [ will ] figure out how to get along , " @entity278 says			2
" in some ways , sci - fi says that the future is still optimistic , because no matter how bleak things are , it suggests that we 're still here			2

visionaries have long predicted how inventions will alter the future
some miracle inventions never had impact desired by creators
why " @entity156 " is *closer* than people realize
" @entity255 " writer : " the miracle " has to come from us , not machines
