@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 attorney representing @entity5 said saturday that the former dictator returned to @entity1 in hopes of recovering millions frozen in @entity9 bank accounts and channeling them through a @entity4 intermediary to help rebuild his troubled homeland			1
in the past , @entity5 has attempted to personally claim the $ 5.7 million in a bank account belonging to a family foundation			1
but attorney @entity16 said the highly controversial and polarizing former leader now wants to use the money to help @entity1 , devastated a year ago by a massive earthquake			1
" he does n't want the funds for himself , " @entity16 told @entity2			0
" he wants a transparent entity to release the funds			0
" @entity16 is working with two other @entity24 attorneys -- former @entity26 congressman @entity25 and @entity27 -- to find a company that could transfer those funds			1
@entity16 named business consultants @entity30 and @entity31 as two possibilities			0
@entity5 stands accused of pillaging @entity1 's national treasury during his brutal 15 - year rule			1
@entity1 authorities are investigating allegations of corruption and embezzlement but the strongman has not yet been formally charged			2
he also could face further charges of human rights abuses committed under his leadership			0
@entity44 wants @entity5 to face justice for the alleged torture and killings of thousands of @entity1			1
@entity25 , who represented @entity24 's @entity48 from 1995 to 2003 , and was the @entity50 's 2008 presidential nominee , said saturday that the allegations against @entity5 are just that			1
" i deal with allegations all the time , " he said			0
" they are the cheapest commodity on the market			0
" @entity25 said he returned to @entity0 for the first time in nearly 30 years because he believed @entity5 is genuinely interested in alleviating @entity1 's suffering			1
he said the @entity60 nation was in worse shape now than it was when @entity5 was at the helm			2
" i also am reminded of others who have risen from the ashes , " @entity25 said			2
" the city of @entity66 is the @entity67 city			0
the people of @entity1 , likewise , will rise from the problems created by last year 's earthquake and emerge stronger and better than before			2
that i know is mr. @entity5 's deep wish and something that he knows in his heart			2
" he said the three @entity4 lawyers were not involved in @entity5 's legal problems in @entity1			1
they were there to advise him on international matters			0
on friday , @entity5 spoke publicly for the first time since his unexpected return			2
he stopped short of apologizing to the @entity1 people but said he regretted their suffering			2
" the desire to participate at your side in this national reconstruction effort is more important than any of the problems i could face , " he said			0
" the price to pay is not important			0
the essential ( thing ) for me is to be with you			0
" he made no mention of political ambition , though his return at a tumultuous moment in @entity1 history has fueled speculation about his real intentions			0
@entity1 's november elections resulted in controversy and have yet to be resolved			0
but many people believe @entity5 's actions were motivated not by power but money			1
reviled by some @entity1 who remember the despot 's lavish lifestyle in the @entity111 's poorest nation , @entity5 reportedly lost much of his wealth in his bitter divorce from @entity114 in the early 1990s			1
@entity16 said @entity5 was living an austere life and was dependent on the generosity of friends and family			0
he has laid claim to the $ 5.7 million in @entity9 but that battle has dragged on for a quarter century			1
a new @entity9 law that goes into effect february 1 eases the repatriation of the money even if @entity1 declines to prosecute @entity5			1
however , @entity1 authorities must show that the country lacked the resources for legal action or that @entity5 was not within reach			1
by making himself available , @entity5 could potentially erase @entity1 's right to the funds			1
after the earthquake , @entity5 pledged some of the money to the @entity136 for relief efforts			1
his attorney in @entity1 , @entity139 , told @entity2 that @entity5 had already transferred money to the agency			1
" there have been media reports for more than a year about a donation from mr. @entity5 for @entity1 earthquake relief , but the @entity147 has no record of ever receiving any donation from him , " said @entity142 , spokeswoman for the @entity136			1
in any case , she said , the @entity136 is not willing to accept @entity5 's money			2
" we simply would not accept a donation from someone accused of taking funds from the coffers of a government entity , " she said			2
@entity16 , who has known @entity5 from childhood , said @entity5 had changed in exile			0
@entity16 found the 59 - year - old @entity5 to be much more humble than he was when he became president for life at the young age of 19			0
" he 's a lot more interested in doing something productive , " @entity16 said			0
@entity5 set foot on @entity1 soil after 25 years in exile			1
he came back to nation struggling to recover from the earthquake 's destruction , a cholera epidemic and political chaos			0
it 's unclear what his presence in @entity1 will mean for its future			0
@entity2 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
