-- dr. @entity1 does n't take any vitamins			1
in fact , while you might think that vitamins are great in any quantity , @entity1 urges you to take a step back and think before swallowing the equivalent of eight cantaloupes in a single dose			1
" i think that alternative medicine is often given a free pass , " he told @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity11			2
" i think we should hold alternative medicine to the same standard that we hold conventional medicine			0
it lives under this sort of untouchable halo			0
i think we should be a little more skeptical			0
" @entity1 , chief of the division of infectious diseases at the @entity23 , is no stranger to controversy -- previously he has taken on the anti-vaccine movement			1
his book " @entity27 ? the @entity28 and @entity29 , " came out tuesday			0
vitamins and supplements , representing about a $ 27 billion industry , are necessary to convert food into energy , but it 's possible to take them in excess , @entity1 said			1
for instance , it 's not uncommon to hear of someone taking 1,000 milligrams of vitamin c , but that 's about the same amount in 14 oranges			1
" vitamins live under this notion that you ca n't possibly hurt yourself , " he said			2
" but you can , by challenging @entity49 and taking these vitamins and concentrating them to these exceptionally large quantities that you would never normally eat			2
" opinion : alternative healing or quackery ? you may have heard the term " antioxidant " as a buzzword that applies to some vitamins			1
antioxidants combat free radicals -- molecules produced when your body breaks down food , or by environmental exposures like tobacco smoke and radiation , according to the @entity67			0
free radicals damage cell membranes and @entity70			0
doctors recommend a healthy intake of fruits and vegetables containing antioxidants to prevent this from happening and apparently decreasing the risk of conditions such as cancer and heart disease			2
however , oxidation is necessary for life , and preventing too much of this process can be a bad thing because cells that need to be destroyed , such as cancer cells , wo n't be			0
there have been several important studies showing the harmful effects of vitamins			2
as @entity1 wrote in an op - ed the @entity91 , a 1994 @entity93 study on 29,000 @entity95 smokers found beta carotene was associated with lung and heart disease death			1
beta carotene and vitamin a in combination were shown in another @entity93 study to be linked to a 46 % greater risk of death from lung cancer than placebo			1
a 2012 @entity106 of multiple randomized clinical trials showed an increase in risk of death may be linked to beta carotene and vitamin e , as well as higher doses of vitamin a. the likely explanation , @entity1 said , is that supplemental antioxidant vitamins , taken in large quantities , cause unnatural behavior in the body , counteracting oxidation too much and leaving the immune system weaker in its defenses against invaders			1
in response to @entity1 's op - ed , the nonprofit @entity124 countered that there is research underscoring the benefits of multivitamins , and that these supplements are prominent in the health care regime of many consumers			1
" consumers should always use caution when considering ' megadoses ' of any supplements , carefully research these choices , and consult a healthcare professional with questions , " the @entity124 said			0
" while dr. @entity1 shares his own hypothesis on supplemental antioxidants in this piece , it has yet to be substantiated			1
until that time , we look forward to future research that would provide guidance for public health			0
" @entity149 , a trade association representing the dietary supplement industry , reacted strongly to @entity1 's book , saying he " weaves together a series of tired old arguments			1
" " dr. @entity1 's credentials as a respected medical physician are well - established , making his dismissal of the value of dietary supplements all the more unfortunate , " council president @entity154 said in a statement			1
" with more than 150 million @entity162 taking dietary supplements each year , it would be a shame if consumers reading this book mistake the opinion of one doctor for the opinion of the medical community as a whole			0
it is important for consumers to have an open dialogue with their health care practitioners about their dietary supplement regimens , and hopefully this book wo n't deter them from doing so			2
" the abundance of strong studies on the harmful effects of megavitamins suggests to @entity1 that these supplements are worse than @entity182			1
that was an anti-inflammatory drug that its manufacturer , @entity184 , voluntarily withdrew from the market in 2004 after evidence emerged of its harm to the heart in some people			0
" i think if vitamins were a regulated industry , you could argue that megavitamins would have a black box warning on them , " he told @entity0			2
because the industry is not regulated , @entity1 said , no one knows if alternative remedies are actually the same , or have a standard concentration , from batch to batch			1
no safety or efficacy data is available , either , the way there is with pharmaceuticals regulated by the @entity207 , he said			0
" i think people have the misconception that these products -- dietary supplements and vitamins -- are made by elves and old hippies that have meadows and flowers , " he said			2
the 1994 @entity218 had the effect of defeating the @entity207 's attempt to regulate the supplements industry , so consumers do n't know what they are buying , @entity1 said			1
" we are the victims of enormous marketing campaign regarding some of these vitamins and supplements , " he said			0
despite the widespread popularity of vitamins and supplements , doctors should n't encourage patients to take these substances just because they want them , he said			0
" i think the message is this : that patients are not customers , and we 're not waiters			0
" @entity0 's @entity238 contributed to this report .			0

studies have shown that vitamins have been linked to disease and death
too much antioxidant vitamins may *disrupt* the immune system 's natural processes
dr. @entity1 argues there should be more regulation of the vitamin and supplement industry
