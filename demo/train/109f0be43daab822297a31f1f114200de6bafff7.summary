-- an @entity2 bishop resigned wednesday following a government report into the sexual abuse of children by catholic clergy -- the second to do so			1
bishop @entity8 was not directly criticized in the @entity9 , but was a member of the @entity12 archdiocese leadership for more than a decade before it put proper protections for children in place , he said			1
@entity8 said he " should have challenged the prevailing culture " of protecting the church rather than children when he was an auxiliary bishop in @entity12 from 1991 to 2002			1
" i know that any action now on my part does not take away the suffering that people have endured , " he said in a written statement			0
" i again apologize to all the survivors and their families			0
i have today offered my resignation as bishop of @entity29 & @entity30 to the holy father			0
i hope it honors the truth that the survivors have so bravely uncovered and opens the way to a better future for all concerned			0
" the @entity36 had no immediate comment on the resignation			0
@entity8 has been a priest for 48 years , he said in the statement			2
