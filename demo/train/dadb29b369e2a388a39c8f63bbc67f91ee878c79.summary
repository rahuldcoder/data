-- @entity1 , the 20 - year - old @entity2 nominee for @entity3 , is sitting in a fancy @entity5 hotel sipping tea and feeling a little out of place			1
see , she grew up in @entity8 , @entity9 , where her dad owned a construction company and her mom ran a summer camp			1
they had land and horses			1
she was a total tomboy : field hockey , softball , basketball on an all - boys team			1
( " i was so dykey			2
" ) one of her nicknames was nitro			2
she lives in @entity23 now , but " little redneck things still come out			2
" like what ? " i 'm attracted to my brother			2
" 10 best movies of 2010 at 14 , she decided she wanted to be an actress and dragged her mom to @entity32 for auditions			2
the people at @entity35 told her she was the best they 'd ever seen			2
her mom told her they were lying			0
( her mom did n't like showbiz much			0
) she auditioned for the role of @entity37 in " @entity38 , " which would have been perfect if @entity37 were a badass , but since she 's a frightened waif , @entity39 ended up not getting the part			1
which was for the best because the role she did get was for " @entity46 , " in which she 's fantastic : harrowing and tender as the 17 - year - old daughter of an @entity50 meth - cooker who 's fighting to take care of her little brother and sister			1
this article appears in the february 17 , 2011 issue of @entity0			1
the issue is available now on newsstands and will appear in the online archive february 4			0
to prep for the part , @entity39 learned how to shoot a gun and field - dress squirrels			1
she already knew how to chop wood : " i went through a wood - chopping phase when i was nine or 10			1
" she says she has n't even bothered preparing an @entity2 speech : " i have been practicing my losing face , though			0
do you want to see it ? " ( for the record , it 's a very good losing face			0
) @entity70 ' later this year comes " x-men : @entity72 , " where she 'll play the mutant mystique , blue - skinned and topless			1
( " did i feel naked being naked ? " she asks , so you do n't have to			0
" ) but before that there 's @entity79 's " @entity78 , " premiering in may , in which she appears alongside a certifiable @entity81			0
which means she has some crazy @entity81 stories , right ? she leans in close			0
" if i say , ' @entity86 ' -- that means you ca n't print it , right ? ' " right			0
so , off the record ... " she 's learning			0
