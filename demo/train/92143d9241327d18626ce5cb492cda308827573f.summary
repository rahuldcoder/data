@entity0 says he 's a frustrated entrepreneur			1
his business , the sale of products for growing and processing marijuana , has always been in a legal limbo in @entity6 , his country			1
legally speaking , it 's a complicated and risky situation			2
selling accessories for the cultivation of cannabis is legal , but the production , sale and distribution of marijuana are not			1
" it would be fantastic , " @entity0 says , " if we could also have access to the market of consumers			0
" the dream of the @entity23 resident is about to come true			0
the @entity6 @entity24 is scheduled to vote tuesday on a controversial bill that would make the small @entity27 country the first in @entity29 to legalize marijuana			1
the bill was approved by the lower house of parliament in july with 50 out of 96 votes			0
it also has the support of president @entity36			0
the bill has generated international headlines because , if approved , the @entity6 government would have the authority to regulate the production , distribution and sale of marijuana			1
the legislation also has the support of the @entity46 , @entity47 's party			2
" more than anything , it 's going to give me peace about growing what i like , which is marijuana			1
that 's what i like to consume			2
it would give me the peace of mind of not having legal troubles for something that should not be illegal , " @entity0 says			2
the bill rests on the premise that if " the state assumes the control and regulation of the activities of importation and exportation , sowing , growing , harvesting , producing ... storing , commercializing and distributing , " then the ills of drug trafficking would be greatly reduced and the quality of the plants improved , benefiting patients and putting drug traffickers out of business			1
the bill would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as much as 480 grams for personal use			2
marijuana clubs of anywhere from 15 to 45 members would also be allowed and granted permission to grow up to 99 plants at a time			2
users would have to register , and those claiming to use cannabis for medical reasons would have to show a doctor 's prescription			2
marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies			0
but many in the traditionally @entity97 country of 3.3 million people feel legislators are espousing the wrong policy for the wrong reasons			0
@entity102 , an opposition senator from the @entity103 , says making marijuana widely available has the potential to create even higher levels of addiction			1
" it 's a very bad piece of legislation , mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market			1
there will be a legal market that can be accessed by most @entity6			1
but there will also be a parallel illegal market for all of those who ca n't get marijuana legally , " @entity102 said			0
proponents of the bill say the legislation addresses some of the concerns expressed by the opposition			0
for one , violators of the law would face sentences of 20 months to 10 years in prison			0
those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances			0
the legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention , and advertising of cannabis in any form would be strictly forbidden			0
@entity135 , a senator with the @entity136 , which supports the bill , said current drug policy , which rests solely on law enforcement and prohibition , has produced no results			0
" this is about regulating drugs			0
it 's does n't mean that it 's a free - for - all , but it does n't mean prohibition either			0
it means regulation has to work to reduce the risks and harmful effects of drug consumption , " @entity135 said			0
in an interview with @entity153 en @entity154 , @entity47 suggested in september that when it comes to drug trafficking , the trafficking part is usually more harmful than the drug itself , especially when it comes to marijuana			1
" we would like to identify those who consume ( marijuana ) , take them out of the shadows and offer to them a regulated opportunity to consume ( the drug ) so that they do n't have to depend on drug traffickers			1
we want to take away the market from drug traffickers by competing with them , " @entity47 said			1
supporters of the bill launched a national campaign called " @entity175			0
" the campaign produced public service announcements in which a doctor , a mother and an attorney suggest it makes sense for @entity6 to support the law			1
once the bill gains approval , there will be a 120 - day period to give the government time to adopt regulations to implement the law .			1
