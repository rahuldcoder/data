-- until the abduction of more than 200 girls at the @entity6 in rural @entity7 , @entity3 's @entity2 insurgency received scant attention in the global media , which gave it brief airtime when the insurgents exploded their bombs or torched a school			1
however , the mass abduction has brought the world 's attention to the callous and unceasing violence that has become routine in northern @entity3 over the last three years			1
the area has suffered more than three decades of religious violence between @entity21 and @entity22			0
but since @entity2 founder @entity25 was killed in a 2009 security crackdown -- along with hundreds of his followers -- the militant @entity24 group has stepped up its attacks			1
@entity2 militants have killed clerics , bombed churches and mosques and assassinated politicians and government officials			1
when the militants attack churches , their aim is to start a sectarian war that will engulf the country ; when they attack mosques , their aim is to exterminate @entity21 they consider collaborators			0
in the last three years , the @entity3 government has opted for the use of force to exterminate the insurgents , rather than diminish the activities of the group -- and it has become more daring and audacious in its attacks			1
despite the allocation of 25 % of the annual budget to defense and security , the government has been unable to crush and contain the insurgency			2
the group has taken on and demoralized the rank and file of the @entity3 army and police			2
@entity2 has launched deadly raids on military garrisons and police and secret intelligence offices to free their detained members			1
the use of force against the group has only led to allegations of a chain of rights abuses with the justification that it is a war on terror			1
@entity3 's @entity68 last year accused the military of arbitrary killings , torture and rape in its campaign , while the military has described reports of civilian casualties as " grossly exaggerated			0
" our constitutional freedom has been formally suppressed by the authorities on the grounds of national emergency			0
the strategy of collective punishment , arbitrary arrests , prolonged detention and killing raids by the security forces has alienated the civil populace and turned them into victims			0
in the war against @entity2 , civilians have become victims of both the military and the militants			1
meeting with @entity2 i mooted the idea of dialogue with the insurgents as a new option towards ending the insurgency and restoring peace to my bewildered and beleaguered nation			1
in september 2011 , i facilitated talks with the insurgents and the former @entity3 president @entity107 -- then chairman of @entity3 's ruling party			1
read more : swap prisoners for kidnapped @entity3 schoolgirls , ex-negotiator says the first surprise in the encounter was that the representatives of the terror group spoke fluent @entity118			2
the bigger surprise was when some of the insurgents revealed that they had university degrees			0
it is a prerequisite for new @entity2 members to burn their university certificates or any paper identification that links them secular schools			1
in the meeting , they justified their violence on the grounds that it was the @entity3 government that had forced them to take up arms			2
they said that before they trod the path of violence , they first tried to take the path of peace			0
they even showed us copies of a petition they wrote to the government complaining about the harassment and intimidation of their sect members by security forces before they picked up arms			2
they showed us photographs of followers and relatives they said had been killed by the police in cold blood , even before the insurgency began and threatened more attacks until they " avenge the injustices done to them			2
" they expressed anger at the way people criticized and condemned them when they launched attacks but kept mute when @entity2 members were killed , their homes demolished and their wives and children arrested by the security forces			1
we took their grievances to the government and advised the government to follow through , but hawks within the corridors of power discouraged the president from taking our advice			2
the second effort at dialogue involved a northern @entity185 cleric and head of the @entity3 sharia council			0
the talks were facilitated by a freelance journalist who was later threatened by those opposed to dialogue			2
this second round of dialogue took place in the last quarter of 2012			0
@entity2 accused the government of leaking the details of the talks to the media for political reasons			1
one of the group 's conditions for talks had been that only their outcome be made public			1
we were close to achieving a ceasefire but again hawks , security and defense contractors in the corridors of power sabotaged our efforts			0
i have never met the @entity2 leader @entity209 but i declined to meet him on two occasions when i got his invitation to interview him			1
i declined because i realized that the government was not interested in my approach			2
' preventable and avoidable ' the abduction of the girls in @entity7 is one of many abductions over the last three years			2
if the @entity3 authorities took lessons from earlier attacks on schools by the insurgents , the @entity7 abductions could n't have happened			0
the @entity7 abduction was a preventable and avoidable tragedy			0
when the militants abduct boys , they use them as conscripts and girls as cooks and hostages			1
i can not confirm if they used abducted girls as sex slaves -- the leadership of the group denied such reports when we asked them , but abducted women who were later freed give credence to such claims			1
each day the @entity7 girls spend in captivity keeps the moral flag of my country at half mast			2
the # @entity246 protest and the interest shown by president @entity248 and other world leaders and celebrities like @entity251 and @entity252 has kept the spirits of @entity7 mothers high and the @entity3 government on its toes			2
when we were children , we used to forecast that one day the @entity258 forest in @entity259 would become a game reserve which would attract foreign tourists and foreign currencies			0
today it is attracting foreign interest for negative reasons			0
the @entity7 girls must be freed but not by the use of force except when other options fail			1
the schoolgirls are now innocent hostages in the hands of soulless gunmen			0
we do n't want the body of the girls to be brought back home , we want them back home alive			0
political future the use of force could turn out to be tragic			0
experience has shown that attempts in the past to free hostages from the insurgents through the use of force has deadly consequences			1
@entity285 hostages were freed in @entity3 through negotiations but a @entity288 and @entity289 hostage were killed in @entity290 when @entity288 forces went to free them			1
we can get the @entity7 girls back home and we must			0
i was delighted to learn that the special team sent by the @entity295 and @entity288 also included experts in hostage negotiation			0
i strongly believe that @entity185 clerics in northern @entity3 and some of the top ranking insurgents currently in detention can be used to open a channel of communication with the leadership of the sect in order to secure the release of the @entity7 girls			0
there are those who say that the option of negotiating to free the hostages will embolden the terrorists , i have never been a hostage but i have been a political prisoner who spent many years in prison during our struggle against military dictatorship in @entity3 in the 1990s			1
those who experience captivity appreciate freedom the most			0
the situation we find ourselves in is a tough moment in our history , but i believe we shall overcome it			0
many @entity3 believe that the way the @entity7 issue is resolved will determine the political future of @entity3			0
opinion : @entity3 right to be wary of @entity295 intentions the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity332 .			1

global media paid @entity2 little attention until 200 girls were abducted , says @entity332
@entity2 became more violent after its founder was killed in 2009 , he says
at talks in 2011 , the group blamed government action for their militancy , @entity332 says
he says the use of force to free hostages can be deadly and negotiations must be held
