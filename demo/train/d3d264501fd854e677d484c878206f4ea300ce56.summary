the @entity0 does n't seem like the ideal place for a vacation during hurricane season , yet many travelers take the gamble and book a cruise to the region anyway			2
it 's a trip that can can go very smoothly or offer some unpleasant surprises , anything from sudden itinerary changes to passengers being left behind when weather conditions change			1
consider @entity14 , which forced many ships to change course last week			1
now , here comes @entity18			0
so what should cruise aficionados consider when booking a summer or fall @entity0 voyage ? we asked @entity23 , editor in chief of @entity25 , to explain some of the realities of cruising when the big storms are most likely to form			2
why do people choose to cruise in the @entity0 during hurricane season ? there are several compelling reasons			2
first , hurricane season in the @entity35 lasts a long time -- from june 1 to november 30 -- and it includes the summer , when school is out and many people are looking to get away with their kids			0
so it 's not realistic to think vacationers will skip the beautiful region for six months , @entity23 said			0
second , it 's a great time for deals			0
" it 's the cheapest time to cruise , and for a lot of people , that 's worth the risk , " @entity23 said			2
third , it 's unlikely most travelers will be caught in a storm			2
if a hurricane forms , cruise ships have sophisticated weather tracking systems and can keep their distance from any rough weather			1
unlike an island resort , which pretty much has to sit there and take it , ships move out of the way of the hurricane , " @entity23 said			1
when @entity14 blew through the @entity0 last week , more than 20 ships changed their itineraries to avoid the storm			1
which leads to the next question : are n't cruise ships obligated to stick to their published itinerary ? you may be surprised that the answer is no. " it 's in the contract of carriage when you buy your ticket that they can go anywhere they want			1
you can buy an eastern @entity0 cruise , and they can go to the western @entity0 , and they do n't have to give you a cent in compensation for that , " @entity23 said			1
she recalled a 2005 incident in which a @entity90 cruise ship was supposed to sail from @entity91 to @entity92 but changed course to @entity94 and @entity95 at the last minute because of an approaching tropical storm			1
the passengers , who were n't prepared for the colder climate , were furious , @entity23 said			0
@entity100 ' em or hate ' em ? cruises divide travelers rough weather is n't the only reason that cruise ships change itineraries			1
this year , dozens of cruises had to be " reset " during the political unrest in parts of @entity110 and the @entity111			0
what happens if you miss your cruise because of a canceled flight to the port city or because the ship leaves early to escape the path of the storm ? things can get tricky			1
if you buy an air / sea package -- or purchase the flight as part of the voyage -- the cruise line will put you up in a hotel and help you get to the next port			1
otherwise , it 's not obligated to do anything , @entity23 said			2
consider what happened august 21 as @entity14 was getting closer to @entity132			1
@entity134 officials in @entity135 ordered @entity90 and carnival ships to depart several hours early , even though not all the passengers had arrived , @entity25 reported			2
there was no way to notify guests of the three - hour change in departure time , @entity90 said in a statement , so 145 of the passengers booked on the @entity145 were left behind			1
the 15 people who reserved their air travel with @entity90 were provided hotel accommodations in @entity135 as well as a flight to @entity150 the next day so they could join the ship			2
the rest -- or " independent guests " -- were advised of hotel availability in @entity135 , but the expense was their responsibility since it was a weather - related event , said @entity158 , a @entity90 spokeswoman			2
" that took my breath away			0
that was the worst display of customer service i have ever seen in the cruise industry , " @entity23 said			0
she pointed out that when faced with the same situation , @entity164 tried to reach out to all of its passengers , arranged for hotel stays and booked flights to @entity170 for those who wanted to meet the ship there			0
it also paid for the expenses or offered refunds in the form of future cruise credits			0
the incident generated 700 comments on @entity25 's message board , most of them expressing horror at what happened , @entity23 said			0
still , she does n't recommend buying air / sea packages from a cruise line to feel safe , because air travel booked this way is often more expensive and less flexible than booking your own flight			2
buy travel insurance instead -- more on that later			1
do cruise lines ever cancel cruises ? very rarely , because they can " make lemonade out of lemons " -- or change the order of port calls or go to another destination , @entity23 said			1
" we monitor the storms closely and make strategic changes to the itineraries to keep them away from the storm , " said @entity201 , a @entity164 spokeswoman , during @entity14			1
" the nice thing ... is that there are a lot of destinations in the @entity0 , so we have lots of options			0
" what should you do to keep a hurricane from ruining your cruise ? buy travel insurance with weather protection , but not necessarily from the cruise line , @entity23 said			1
ask your travel agent for help , or shop around for a good policy			0
if you 're cruising during hurricane season , get to the departure city a day early so you do n't have to worry about missing the ship			0
" do n't tempt fate , " @entity23 said			0
if there is a storm that could affect the region you 're cruising in , stay close to your ship in case it needs to depart early			1
do n't go off on a three - hour trip by yourself , @entity23 said			0
many people plan marriage ceremonies in scenic port stops , like @entity239 or @entity240 in the @entity241			0
be very careful about doing that during hurricane season			0
" you can plan this beautiful wedding for yourself on the wednesday that you 're there , but if a hurricane comes and you do n't go there , you 're out of luck , " @entity23 said .			0

rough weather is possible , but ships usually move out of the way of a storm
cruise ships are not obligated to stick to their published itinerary
cruise lines took different approaches when guests were left behind before @entity14
expert : buy travel insurance ; stay close to the ship if a storm is approaching
