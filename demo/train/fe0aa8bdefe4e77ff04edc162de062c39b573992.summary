-- stretching some 7,000 kilometers along the @entity3 coastline , a submarine fiber - optic cable emerges off the coast of @entity5 to help bridge the digital divide in the continent			1
dubbed @entity8 , the system links @entity3 with @entity10 , bringing ultra-fast broadband in the region			1
it runs from @entity14 in @entity15 through @entity16 in @entity17 to @entity18 in @entity5 and branches out in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , and @entity23			1
the cable , which has a capacity of 1.92 terabits a second , first went live in july 2010 , becoming the first subsea cable to bring open - access , broadband capacity in @entity3 , according to @entity30 , chief executive of @entity5 's @entity31			1
she says high - speed , low - priced , reliable broadband is key in transforming @entity3 economies and creating job opportunities			1
" when you think of @entity3 coming into the information age , you think of educational institutions , you think of business opportunities , you think of social awareness , better communication , transparency in government , " says @entity30 , a former executive at @entity38 telecoms giant @entity37			2
" in order to make @entity3 ( and ) @entity5 competitive again and in order to make our schools competitive , to make businesses here competitive and ... to give young people access to opportunities , access to markets , access to ideas ... we need a society , as a population to be better connected to the internet , " she adds			2
web savvy @entity62 fuel growth in online shopping after the launch of @entity67 , more undersea fiber - optic projects have been rolled out in the region , including @entity69 by @entity5 telecoms group @entity70			1
similarly , several other efforts have been deployed in eastern and southern @entity3 in recent years			0
yet , slow connectivity and high internet costs are still major problems -- according to figures by the @entity78 , internet - user penetration in @entity73 was 10.6 % in 2010 , far behind the world average of about 30 %			0
" even in the countries in which we 're already in - land , broadband penetration is still under 10 % rate , so there 's a lot of road for growth and improvement , " says @entity30			2
born in @entity5 , @entity30 moved to the @entity38 in 1984 to study at @entity90			0
after a 20 - year - old career in the @entity38 telecommunications industry she returned to @entity5 in 2005 , where she saw " first - hand " the country 's absence of internet infrastructure and the need for better web connectivity			2
" i just felt personally the need was so glaring and that was what motivated me to start trying to solve the problem , " says @entity30			0
" the more i looked at it on my kitchen table the more visible it became to put a business together and that 's what i did			0
" starting all by herself , @entity30 managed to raise $ 240 million after securing the support of various investors from the continent			0
" it 's all @entity3 financing , " she explains , " i look at those people who wrote checks ... the angel investors when i had no license , it was a business sheet on a piece of paper and it really was n't about making money , it was really about a deep understanding and desire to transform a society and to say that we could address some of these problems @entity3 had			0
" that we understood the challenges , there was a lot of work to be done and that we wanted to pull people on board , pull ourselves together to address those problems , " she adds			0
today , @entity30 says , the system has helped improve the availability of internet services , especially in @entity18 and @entity16 , as well as lowering wholesale prices significantly , by up to 80 per cent			1
@entity3 's emerging leaders launch 2020 growth vision but despite the big decrease in wholesale cost , @entity30 notes that consumers have still not seen a difference in the price they pay -- she says that all of @entity5 's infrastructure is self - provisioned by different retail operators , which keep charging the same prices for the domestic part of the services			1
" the people who own the distribution networks are not passing on the saving , there 's no open - access distribution or common carriers like you would have in a developed market , " says @entity30			1
the lack of a national backbone infrastructure on an open - access basis is also making expensive to move capacity within @entity5 , according to @entity30			1
as a result , she says , connecting people from the company 's landing point in @entity5 to @entity166 costs less than connecting people across @entity18			2
" you have to buy that infrastructure from people who own it for their own proprietary use , so it 's a cartel - like situation , " she says			0
therefore , @entity8 , which does not sell its capacity directly to homes or small and medium - size businesses , has also started investing in distribution infrastructure , building its own networks when it ca n't find " commercially reasonable rates , " as @entity30 explains			0
" the biggest challenge that we see is getting the capacity we have in this big pipe that we brought into @entity5 and @entity17 across the region to reach the people and businesses where they need the service , " she says			2
there are also plans to extend the cable down the coast to @entity194 and connect it with @entity195 , the underwater @entity197 fiber - optic cable that became fully operational in 2009			1
despite the challenges , @entity30 says the high demand she had hoped for when she first started sketching out her business plan on her kitchen table back in 2007 is still there			0
" people know they want better access to the internet , they want faster , cheaper , they want to be able to drive new kinds of applications , access different types of content , " she says .			0

@entity30 is the chief executive of @entity5 's @entity31
she says her firm laid the first *sub-sea* cable linking @entity3 and @entity10 to bring broadband to the region
the fiber - optic cable runs from @entity14 in @entity15 to @entity16 in @entity17 and @entity18 in @entity5
@entity30 says the lack of a backbone , open - access infrastructure is keeping prices high for consumers
