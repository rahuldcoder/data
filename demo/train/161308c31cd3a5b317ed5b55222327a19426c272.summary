-- last week , @entity2 's second - largest city of @entity3 fell to the @entity4 in @entity2 and @entity5 , or @entity6			1
in a few hours , the city 's security forces had dropped their weapons and uniforms and fled			2
since then , the militants introduced a political charter in @entity3 and marched south , seizing additional towns en route to the capital , @entity16			0
in taking @entity3 alone , @entity6 gained as much as $ 425 million in cash , an unspecified quantity of gold bullion , huge amounts of light and heavy weaponry ( mostly @entity23 - made ) and probably hundreds of new recruits from three main detention centers , all which were overrun			1
this @entity2 - based offensive has been coming for at least two years			1
after the last @entity23 military personnel withdrew from @entity2 on december 31 , 2011 , the then - @entity4 in @entity2 began its gradual but determined recovery -- befitting the organization 's mantra of baqiya wa tatamadad ( " lasting and expanding " )			1
the strategy was meticulously planned and carried out in clear stages			0
principally , in @entity2 these militants ( @entity6 since april 2013 ) have spent two years breaking senior leaders out of prison and re-establishing a professional command and control structure ; expanding operational reach , including into @entity5 , and exploiting rising @entity40 discontent with the @entity42 - led government of @entity2 prime minister @entity43 , thereby encouraging sectarianism			1
it has expanded extensive underground networks in @entity40 strongholds , particularly @entity3 , @entity16 and @entity49 province ; stepped up coordinated , often near - simultaneous bombings ; and debilitated @entity2 security force capacity and morale through a concerted campaign of intimidation and assassination			1
@entity6 has substantial roots in @entity3 , where it managed to remain a potent force during and after the @entity23 troop " surge			2
" the group has recently been raising $ 1 million - $ 2 million per month in @entity3 through an intricate extortion network			0
this reality , plus @entity3 's proximity to @entity6 positions in eastern @entity5 , made the city a natural launching ground for this shock offensive in @entity2 , which is ultimately aimed at @entity16			1
but this is not all about @entity6			2
many other armed @entity40 actors are involved in what has become , in effect , a @entity40 uprising -- groups such as the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 fil @entity2 and various tribal military councils			1
@entity6 may be the largest force involved ( with about 8,000 fighters in @entity2 ) , but it is far from sufficient to take and hold multiple urban centers			1
it is still totally reliant on an interdependent relationship with what remains a tacitly sympathetic and facilitating @entity40 population			0
but this " relationship " is by no means stable and should not be taken for granted			0
the militant group has consistently failed to retain popular support , or at minimum , acceptance			0
@entity3 residents might be praising the current stability and @entity6 - subsidized bread and fuel prices , but once the public flogging , amputations and crucifixions begin , this may well change			2
in fact , it is not surprising that tribal elements are already preparing to force @entity6 from captured areas			2
the militants ' prospects are also dependent on the government and its supporters continuing to advance sectarianism -- something that encourages @entity40 actors to accept @entity6			1
unfortunately , this apparent sectarianism has been consolidated in recent days with @entity43 's call for a " volunteer army " encouraging the further reconstitution of the @entity114 , @entity115 and the @entity116 ( three @entity42 militias active during the @entity23 occupation of @entity2 , which appear to be receiving a new boost in recruitment )			2
further calls by @entity122 to form " @entity130 " and by the @entity42 community in @entity123 to form " @entity125 " -- as well as grand ayatollah @entity127 's call for @entity2 to take up arms against @entity6 -- have increased the perception of sectarianism inside and outside @entity2			1
@entity132 's role is crucial			0
already , the commander of @entity132 's external @entity134 , @entity135 , is in @entity16 , and @entity2 sources have reported 500 @entity138 personnel arriving in the capital and , allegedly , 1,500 @entity141 militiamen ( @entity132 paramilitary force ) in @entity123			1
as such , it seems wise at this point for the @entity23 not to get actively involved militarily in @entity2 but to focus on containment and intelligence collection			0
the conflicts in @entity2 and @entity5 are intricately linked -- to act on one and not the other would be a strategic misstep			0
last week , the @entity2 insurgency was just that , an insurgency			0
fighters carried assault rifles and drove pickups mounted with heavy machine guns , while others drove civilian cars and minivans			0
anti-tank weaponry was minimal ( but growing , thanks to @entity5 ) , and anti-aircraft weapons were confined to guns and a small number of aging sa - 7 man - portable air - defense systems			0
in addition to massive quantities of small arms and ammunition , this latest offensive has seen @entity6 reportedly seize dozens of @entity23 - made armored humvees and military transport vehicles , @entity23 m198 howitzers and possibly even helicopters			2
there have been reports that other @entity40 groups have seized more than a dozen armored personnel carriers and tanks			0
there can be no underestimating the impact this will have upon @entity2 instability			0
but this is not just about @entity2			0
within 12 hours of seizing @entity3 , there were reports that @entity6 transferred humvees , manpower and other weaponry into eastern @entity5			0
meanwhile , on thursday , a human rights group reported that @entity5 - based @entity190 crossed with other @entity40 groups into @entity192 in @entity2 's @entity49 province and captured several humvees			1
opinion : @entity197 's toxic legacy in @entity2 the @entity2 - @entity5 border is therefore increasingly immaterial -- conflict on both sides of the border has become inherently interconnected			2
as the only group genuinely operating on both sides of it , @entity6 maintains an overarching strategy ( aimed toward establishing a unitary @entity4 and the @entity205 ) , whereby operations in @entity5 and @entity2 feed off one another			1
considering recent events and its march to @entity16 , this objective might not be so inconceivable			0
but beware of coming to too simplistic a conclusion			0
@entity6 ' self - interested pursuit of its absolutist ideals has made it countless enemies in @entity5 , and it will face huge challenges to avoid a similar fate in @entity2			1
nonetheless , whatever its fate , @entity6 represents a formidable force with an ever growing membership			1
this latest offensive is arguably the most significant event in @entity40 jihadism since 9/11			2
having already challenged @entity225 's ideological legitimacy , @entity6 has now underlined its perceived military superiority to a receptive younger and more fanatical generation of potential recruits around the world			1
while @entity225 and its affiliates are embracing a more patient locally focused strategy , @entity6 manifests a determination for rapid , dramatic results			1
it 's certainly just shown these in @entity2			2
but whether this will prove a more effective long - term strategy remains to be seen .			0

@entity238 : @entity6 gaining recruits , cash and weapons in *inevitable* offensive in @entity2
@entity238 : @entity6 gains from what has become a @entity40 uprising , but its ties to @entity2 's @entity40 *unstable*
he says once @entity6 *brutality* starts , support may change and @entity6 will be forced back
@entity238 : @entity6 a formidable , fanatical force bent on rapid results but may fail in long term
