-- that which does not kill us only makes us laugh			2
that seems to be the governing principle in this outrageously offensive , but ridiculously funny , effort from agent provocateur @entity8			1
the " @entity10 " star has now exhausted the characters he introduced in " @entity12 " and presumably worn out his welcome as a celebrity interviewer			0
in " @entity15 , " his third and most outwardly conventional @entity17 vehicle , he introduces us to one " general admiral @entity18 , " a @entity20 despot who resembles @entity22 's colonel @entity21 , but with an @entity24 beard , and something of @entity28 president @entity27 's knack for international diplomacy			1
( the film is dedicated to the memory of the @entity32			0
) summoned to the @entity33 to explain his country 's mushrooming nuclear weapons program , @entity15 plans to throw down the gauntlet , but instead he 's abducted from his hotel room and only escapes assassination by the skin of his teeth			1
this close shave leaves him unrecognizably clean shaven , alone and anonymous on the streets of @entity47 , supplanted by an idiot double under the control of his conniving uncle ( played by @entity52 )			0
mistaken for a political refugee by the well - meaning manager of a vegan cooperative grocery store ( played by @entity56 ) , @entity15 embarks on a new career in the service industry until he can get his country back			1
there 's nothing very original in this scenario , except perhaps for the unthinking brutality of the hero			2
@entity8 and his regular collaborator director @entity66 scarcely concern themselves putting the mechanics of the plot in place			1
as a piece of storytelling " the dictator " is perfunctory to the point of disdain			0
in their previous efforts these merry pranksters have operated on the margins of documentary , improvising recklessly with the unpredictable dynamics of volatile situations and unsuspecting dupes			0
such mockery took cunning and courage , as well as brilliantly quick comic reflexes			0
at its best it exposed the venal hypocrisy , ignorance and prejudice lurking just beneath the surface of polite society			0
perhaps sensing that they 're inherently on safer but also more sterile ground here , working with actors and from a script , they compensate with a barrage of bad taste and near - the - knuckle gags			0
there is something to offend just about everyone : 9/11 jokes , rape jokes , race jokes , child abuse jokes , you name it			0
a barking chauvinist bigot , @entity15 makes borat look like a puppy dog			1
but he 's certainly bracing company , the scourge of political correctness and a walking litmus test of our commitment to free speech			2
we 've seen plenty of taboo - busting comedies over the last few years , but this one really goes for the jugular			0
lesbians , the disabled , the @entity125 , several @entity17 stars , @entity127 and @entity128 all have reasons to cringe			0
baron @entity8 is an equal opportunities agitator ; he takes on everybody at once and dares you not to laugh			1
how can you not , when @entity15 attempts to impersonate a @entity125 - @entity135 tourist by pressing his fingers to his eyes and pronouncing his " r " s and " l " s , apparently convinced of his acting prowess after starring in several vanity projects back home in @entity142			1
the joke is more sophisticated than it first appears when you consider that it 's performed by an @entity146 , caricaturing a @entity147			2
for all its crudity and occasional flatness , " @entity15 " is a satire that takes no prisoners and valuable for that reason			1
in his big climactic speech , even the irredeemable @entity15 rises to the occasion with a brilliant piece of political oratory that turns the tables on everything we think we know about today 's cultural jihad			1
it 's a superbly cheeky cinematic coup worthy of another great @entity165 comedian , @entity164 .			2
