a @entity1 artist is turning people into paintings			1
@entity4 skips the canvas in her artwork			1
instead , she physically paints on human subjects -- on their clothes , their shoes , their skin , their hair			1
then she places them in a real - life setting and photographs it			1
the result is an image that looks like a painting within a photo			2
it 's an optical illusion that blurs the lines of where reality ends and art begins			2
" we are so used to taking things at face value			2
and then all of a sudden , something defies your perception			0
it makes you rethink what you 've seen there , " @entity30 said			1
@entity30 's work comes together in four steps -- painting , photography , art installations and performance art. " i like for my work to create this living element			1
when you look at a photo of one of my installations , you see the painted thing but then you actually see the person coming through it , " said the 27 - year - old , who lives in @entity43			1
" you see the eyes , the hair , and these signs of life			2
it creates this beautiful tension between the painted surface and the photographed person beneath it			1
" a chance career @entity30 's talent for turning a three - dimensional scene into what looks like a two - dimensional painting almost went unnoticed			1
" a lot of people ask me where i went to art school , but i did n't study art. i studied politics , " said the @entity67 graduate			0
" i set up this really comfortable career path for myself ... but i realized i 'd always dreamed of being an artist			2
... at 22 , i decided that i would pick this up and make it my job to teach myself how to paint			0
" instead of sitting behind a desk , @entity30 ended up in her parents ' basement in @entity81 , painting on grapefruits , fried eggs and sausage			1
she started painting on people by chance			0
" when i originally started this project , the idea was to capture shadows			0
i started putting black paint down on shadows and then i started putting black paint on people on the shadows , " she said			0
" before i knew it , i was turning people into paintings			0
" but following her passion meant finding creative ways to make a living			0
" making art is something that comes out of you , but the job of being an artist is something completely different , " she said			2
" it was really terrifying going from this idea of having a steady job trying to make a career in politics to becoming an artist			2
... i 've had to be quite entrepreneurial with figuring out how i could support myself through my artwork			0
" when @entity30 first started her career , she did n't have any art shows			1
she painted a man in her basement and then photographed him on the @entity81 subway			1
" it was like the greatest art opening ever			0
everyone was asking what was going on and taking photos , " she said			0
" the art show on the subway turned out to be one of my most iconic pieces of work			2
" a boost from the internet @entity30 got her big break when a post about her work went viral			1
" there was this blog post ... on body painting			0
and my friend wrote in the comments , ' you should check out @entity4 's work , ' " she said			1
" the next day the blogger posted a photo of my work , a 12 - word caption and a link to my website			1
and then all of a sudden overnight it went totally viral			2
i was getting phone calls from all over the world			0
" the exposure eventually led to her to giving a speech at the 2013 @entity155 conference in @entity156 , @entity157			0
" being able to share my story at the @entity160 conference has allowed almost 2 million people now to watch the video and learn about what i do , " @entity30 said			1
with all the buzz on the @entity131 , @entity30 no longer has to search for people to model for her			1
" when i first started out , it was impossible to get people to model for me , " she said			0
" but now i have a waiting list of over a thousand people			0
" @entity30 has made a name for herself through exhibitions , commissioned portraits and special projects , such as painting a @entity175 on the streets of @entity177			1
she also sells limited - edition prints on her website			2
" it 's always a risky thing to go for the improbable , " she said			0
" but there 's this saying that i really love that is , ' without risking the ridiculous , artists will never get anywhere beyond the pre-validated and mundane			0
' and i chose to risk the ridiculous			0

artist @entity4 physically paints on human subjects
