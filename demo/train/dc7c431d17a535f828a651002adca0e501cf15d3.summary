to watch or not to watch			0
that is the question for 12 jurors and six alternates in the @entity5 murder trial of former @entity7 player @entity6 when the region 's beloved @entity7 play in @entity9 on sunday			1
on a day in which the girlfriend of victim @entity13 took the stand and @entity13 's mother again left the courtroom in tears , @entity11 judge @entity10 on friday had a warning for the jury			1
" i am not going to forbid you from watching the @entity9 if that 's something that 's really important to you , " she said			0
but the judge closed the second day of testimony by advising jurors to be vigilant for mention of @entity6 , who helped lead the @entity7 to @entity26 nearly three years ago			1
" you hear that word , you 've got to walk out of the room , " @entity10 said			0

@entity50 testified that she introduced @entity13 to @entity6 on her birthday in august 2012			1
@entity50 told the jury that @entity13 and @entity6 were in the " beginning stages of a friendship			1
" she said the two men and others would gather in @entity6 's basement " man cave " -- with fitness and theater rooms , a bar and pool table emblazoned with the @entity7 ' logo -- to smoke marijuana			1
but @entity50 said she was not aware of her boyfriend and @entity6 hanging out except for the day @entity13 was killed			1
in opening statements thursday , defense lawyer @entity72 said the two men were close friends and that @entity6 had no reason to kill @entity13			1

on thursday , prosecutor @entity106 said @entity6 not only orchestrated , but also participated in and covered up the killing			0

" the three picked up @entity13 and drove to a secluded area where he was shot and killed , @entity106 said			0

" as soon as they found out @entity6 -- a celebrity football player for the @entity7 -- was a friend of @entity13 's , it was over , " he said			1
the prosecution will try to " dazzle and distract you " with the fruits of an investigation that was " sloppy and unprofessional , " @entity72 said			0
the case against his client is " just a story and it 's not true , " he added			0
the prosecutors will argue that @entity13 's killing was a " joint venture			1
" under @entity5 state law , prosecutors do n't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger			0
under joint venture , anyone who actively participates in a killing can be found guilty , according to legal experts			0
