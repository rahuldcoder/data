@entity0 , @entity1 -- at least three protesters were shot dead from close range in a clash with police friday outside the @entity1 prime minster 's office , a hospital official said , an escalation of some of the worst politically fueled tension to wrack the southern @entity14 nation in 14 years			1
the face - off also left 23 demonstrators hurt , including three in critical condition with head injuries at @entity19 , according to its emergency unit chief , @entity20			0
he said that at least 17 police officers also injured in the confrontations were at that hospital , one of the city 's main medical facilities			1
a report from state - run network @entity29 had a slightly higher injury toll from hospitals throughout @entity0 , @entity1 's capital and most populated city			1
it put the count at 35 demonstrators and 27 police			0
the opposition @entity38 claimed , on its website , that around 250,000 people gathered outside prime minister @entity42 's office to implore him to resign amid allegations of corruption and fraud related to the june 2009 election			1
some of the protesters threw stones and @entity50 cocktails at some of the more than 1,000 police who were at the scene , ostensibly to provide security			0
authorities responded by using water cannons in an attempt to disperse the crowds			0
afterwards , @entity1 's current president , @entity60 , issued a statement urging all political parties to resume talks soon and not to reopen old wounds -- referring to a 1997 at - times violent crisis that also targeted @entity42 , who was then the nation 's president			1
@entity60 urged " calm and self - restraint " by all @entity1 , as well as support for the police and governmental institutions			1
the @entity73 @entity72 in @entity0 issued a like - minded statement on friday , expressing " deep regret that ( the protest ) was not peaceful " and calling on all sides " to abstain from provocations			2
" rather , the embassy pushed for " constructive dialogue and compromise to resolve the existing political differences			0
" and the @entity83 , which has been considering adding @entity1 as a member , also " urgently " appealed to " all political forces ... to engage in a constructive ( dialogue ) and to mobilize the countries ' energies " to resolve the political stalemate			1
" demonstrators are instruments of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly for citizens , " said @entity83 foreign policy chief @entity90 and @entity91 , commissioner for enlargement and the @entity14 neighborhood policy , in a statement			2
" we deplore that today 's event has spiralled into violence			2
" yet key players in friday 's incident , and in the long - brewing political friction in @entity1 , showed no signs of backing down friday			1
@entity42 directly blamed the casualties on his chief political rival , @entity38 leader @entity109 , whom he accused of scheming to have demonstrators take over the prime minister 's office , parliament and key ministries , state - run @entity108 news agency reported			1
@entity109 " will take full responsibility , " @entity42 told reporters , adding that friday 's actions " will not be accepted , but punished			2
" for his part , @entity109 -- who is also the mayor of @entity0 -- accused government forces of going overboard , and blamed police for provoking protesters by using the water tanks and tear gas			1
earlier this month , in an interview quoted in a @entity38 newsletter , @entity109 reiterated long - standing claims that @entity42 's ruling @entity128 had rigged the most recent election			2
" are there any @entity1 who have not yet understood that ( @entity42 ) stole the elections in order to rob @entity1 ? " he said			2
" that was clear to us from the very beginning , but by now it has become clear to every reasonable @entity1			2
" the country 's supreme court determined that the elections were orderly , and the ballots were burned by the @entity140			0
the @entity38 boycotted @entity1 's parliament between september 2009 and february 2010 , according to the @entity142			1
efforts since then to resolve the long political stalemate have been unsuccessful , with opposition parties continuing to push hard against the @entity146 in alleging corruption			0
on friday , @entity42 guaranteed that there would " be no early elections " and that " general elections will be held in 2013 , " a rebuttal to the timeline being pushed by the opposition			0
the tensions escalated in the past two weeks , after a former government minister sent the media a secret recording that allegedly documented an illicit back - room deal			0
in the video , then - deputy prime minister @entity159 asked @entity161 , who at that point was @entity1 's economic minister , to arrange for irregular contracts and have the government hire hacks who belonged to his small party , the @entity167			1
@entity168 later replaced @entity161 , a member of that same party , as economic minister			0
he resigned from that position last week , even as he claimed that the tape featuring him and @entity173 had been manipulated with bits edited in and out , out of context			0
still , the opposition largely has focused its wrath on @entity42			0
this is not his first time under fire : in 1997 , for instance , angry mobs protested against @entity42 -- then the nation 's president -- after voting irregularities and costly ponzi schemes plunged @entity1 into near - anarchy and led to snap elections			1
the animosity , and harsh rhetoric , have heightened in recent weeks			0
in addition to increasingly pointed , accusatory barbs between @entity109 and @entity42 , personal slurs marred a parliamentary session this week meant to settle governmental changes following @entity168 's resignation .			0
