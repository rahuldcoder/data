-- oh , he was n't always so quiet			2
contrary to his somber popular image -- created in the early days of @entity3 and never truly put to rest -- @entity5 loved to laugh , and he loved to make others laugh			1
after all , this is a man who mortgaged his house so @entity10 could make " @entity11 " because he wanted to see it -- " still the most anybody 's ever paid for a cinema ticket , " jokes @entity10 's @entity15			2
" he was a very amusing person , " says his widow , @entity16 , in a phone interview from @entity18 , the longtime @entity5 residence in @entity19 , @entity20			1
" he was funny , and he made you funny to be around him , and if you could make him laugh , that was just great			1
" of course , he could be quiet			2
he loved to spend hours working in his gardens			1
he could be prickly , too -- and thoughtful , and bitter , and expansive , and wistful			2
in other words , he was a human being , this @entity28 and @entity29 and musician and racing enthusiast			1
( you did n't know about the auto racing ? ) as @entity34 's award - winning documentary on @entity5 , " @entity5 : @entity35 , " revealed , he was n't easily pigeonholed -- and he liked nothing more than to take the piss out of all the cliches			1
after all , this was a man who gleefully participated in a mockumentary about the @entity42 , a parody @entity28 whose characters included a tight trouser - loving manager named @entity47 , a movie called " @entity49 " and a spouse identified as " a simple little @entity52 girl whose father had invented @entity54 played a reporter present at the pillaging of the @entity42 ' business headquarters			2
" @entity59 , " which premiered last fall on @entity60 ( whose parent company also owns @entity0 ) and has been making its way around the world , is being released on video on may 1			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity16 and the documentary 's music producer , @entity65 , son of @entity28 producer sir @entity68			1
( sir @entity5 , 86 , is " great , " says @entity65 , noting that , having hung it up three years ago , " he 's enjoying early retirement			1
" ) the following is an edited and condensed version of the transcript			2
@entity0 : people often are n't aware of what a great sense of humor @entity5 had			1
he was thought of as " the quiet @entity28 , " the " mystical @entity28			2
" i wonder if either of you have stories about his humor			1
@entity16 : he was mischievous			2
he did like to tease people a lot			2
i just got so used to being wound up -- he just wound me up every single day i think i knew him			2
and he said , " you 're just so easy to wind up			2
" he 'd make some really bad remark , and he 'd just do it so i 'd start protesting			2
and he was funny , and he made you funny to be around him , and if you could make him laugh , that was just great			1
@entity0 : and you , @entity65 ? @entity65 : i was a kid [ attending ] @entity92 at @entity93			2
i was standing in the urinals , kind of embarrassed , and he said , " do you need any help ? " he 'd seen me with my parents , but i did n't recognize him			2
... [ upon leaving , the stranger started chatting with @entity65 ' parents			0
] they said , " @entity5 , have you met my son @entity65 ? " and he said , " yes , we just had a piss next to each other			1
" there was no pomp and circumstance with him			0
and whenever it came to [ recording at ] @entity112 , there was no red carpet			0
he wanted everyone to be treated the same			0
@entity0 : what do you think @entity5 would be doing if he had n't played music ? he loved gardening and auto racing			1
@entity5 : i have no idea			1
he always said he had no idea what he would have done if he was n't a musician			1
he did n't have a clue			0
he 'd have been a total failure , he said			0
he had no idea how to do anything else			0
i think he would have found something , but i do n't think he was ever meant to be anything else			0
when you ca n't do anything else , that 's what you are			0
if you have to paint , you have to write , you have to do music , that 's who you are			0
you do n't have any choice			0
and he really felt he did n't have any choice			0
@entity0 : so he did n't see dropping the guitar and becoming a landscape architect			0
@entity5 : oh , i think he did			1
and he did that , too			0
but early on in life , if he had n't been a musician , there was n't an option to not be one			1
that 's how it was			0
@entity0 : in the film , you talk about the gardens at @entity18 and how much effort and love he put into them			0
@entity5 : and it was n't just here , it was in general			1
it 's funny : the root of @entity5 is " geo , " which means " of the earth			1
" and that 's -- again -- that 's who he was			0
he just loved being out in nature			1
@entity0 : @entity65 , the music for the documentary came from a range of sources			1
what challenges did you have in producing it ? @entity65 : @entity34 [ @entity34 ] would want the song , say , " @entity174 , " which is a classic track from a classic album , but it 's made for vinyl			1
and if you played it in the cinema , it would n't be the way you remember it sounding			0
so you 're ripping everything apart and putting it together so it sounds how you think you should remember it			0
and that 's a challenge , because you have to pay utmost respect to the original creation , and at the same time , you have to rub everyone 's memories the right way			0
@entity0 : @entity16 , did @entity5 usually put in a lot of winks and nudges to you when he wrote songs ? @entity5 : there were a lot of songs that i would look back on and go , " oh yeah			1
" he expressed his emotions in his songs			1
he did n't really express them so much in daily life			0
he saved them up , i think			0
sometimes , he was difficult to talk to about certain things , and then he would write a song , and i 'd say , " how can you do that ? how can you put your whole thoughts and inner being out there in a song ? " i could never do that			0
that was just the way he was -- how artists are			0
they 're baring their souls to you			0
so nudges and winks ? i guess there are a lot of them			0
@entity0 : what has been the reaction to the film since its release ? @entity5 : it 's been extraordinary			1
we went to @entity228 , to the film festival there , [ and ] for them , to see footage of @entity5 riding around in a rickshaw in @entity232 -- not being a tourist , but participating in daily life there -- they were so happy			1
it was such a great response			1
it 's been going around the world , to the @entity239 , and it 's going to @entity240			0
it 's a thoughtful documentary			2
it evokes something in all of us -- what are we doing ? are we doing ok in our lives ? and are we making enough effort ? and i think it touches that chord in people			0
@entity0 : i think the ending is one of the most moving things i 've ever witnessed			0
@entity5 : we tried to end the documentary in a different way , but @entity34 tried so many different endings and he said , " no , that 's it			1
that 's the end of a life			0
" i think it 's a surprising documentary -- it leads you somewhere you do n't expect			2
you certainly do n't expect it to be as deep			0
i think it 's a real tribute to @entity34 that he managed to capture that .			1
