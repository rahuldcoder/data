@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 went to @entity4 expecting trouble			1
a veteran anti-porpoise hunting activist , @entity8 documents and protests the killing of the mammals			1
his actions are deeply unpopular in many of the @entity4 coastal communities that cling to the tradition of catching and eating whale			1
@entity3 's organization , the @entity16 , has a long and colorful history of clashing with the @entity4			1
in the @entity21 series " @entity22 , " @entity16 volunteers impede @entity4 whale fishing off the coast of @entity25			1
their tactics include placing their boats in front of whaling ships , attempting to carry out citizen 's arrests of the @entity4 crew and heaving acid stink bombs onto the vessels			1
for their efforts , the @entity16 volunteers have had flash bang grenades thrown at them , their boats sunk in collisions and detainment for days by the @entity4 crews			1
the show has made the @entity16 members reality tv stars and notorious in @entity4			1
march 11 started like many other days for @entity3			1
he was in an unfriendly territory , a small @entity4 coastal town where a porpoise hunt was under way and the efforts of outsiders to document the slaughter were not welcome			1
@entity3 led a five person @entity16 team of @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 to the town of @entity58 , @entity4			1
they were joined by @entity60 a cameraman from @entity62 , a group that often collaborates with @entity16			0
the activists had other company , as well			0
closely monitoring the group were two plain clothes @entity4 policemen the activists nicknamed " @entity69 , " for the @entity71 comedy about a cop and his sidekick , a dog			1
as detailed in the @entity75 winning documentary " @entity77 , " the relationship between anti-porpoise hunt activists and @entity4 authorities often becomes a game of cat and mouse			1
the police try to impede the activists from documenting the killing of the dolphins			0
the activists use disguises and other sleights of hand to keep the police off their tails			0
a former @entity95 and customs investigator , @entity3 said he is still able to think like law enforcement agents			1
and he recounts with a smile how he managed to lose @entity98 and @entity69 at a traffic light with some creative driving as they tried to shadow his group			0
@entity3 is back in his home in @entity0 , @entity1			1
it 's been just over 24 hours since he returned from @entity4 and four days since the earthquake and tsunami that wrecked much of the country			1
as he thinks of the two cops back in @entity58 his mood darkens			1
" you know those guys are probably dead , " he said			0
when the earthquake hit in @entity58 , about 94 miles from @entity114 , the quake 's epicenter , the activists were at the town 's port waiting for the porpoise fishing boats to return with their catch			1
" the car was rocking and rolling it was actually jumping on the pavement like a frog , " @entity3 said			2
" we got out of the cars and it was almost impossible to stand up			0
it lasted for a long time			0
" immediately seafood workers got out of factories as the town loud speakers called for residents to seek higher ground			0
the six activists jumped into their two cars and made for the hills			0
it was a snap decision that @entity3 believes saved their lives			2
" if we had stayed where we were , they probably would have never found our bodies or our cars , " @entity3 said			2
@entity3 estimates that the drive to higher ground took them about eight minutes			2
in that time the first tsunami waves already crashed into the town			0
@entity151 took from the hillside shows fishing ships fighting the incoming rush of water to get to the open ocean and safety			0
houses can be seen being dragged out to sea by the monster waves			0
on the hillside , the activists were joined by a handful of rescue workers and a @entity4 woman			2
" it was impossible to comprehend the amount of devastation and the human misery , " @entity3 said " how many people got to the hill ? there were only a handful of us up there			1
why are n't there thousands here with us ? " in the video he took from the hill , @entity3 narrates as a wave heads toward the area below where they have sought refuge			2
" look at the black one heading toward us , " he said			0
an aftershock rocks the activists			0
" this is scary s * * t , " a woman says off camera			0
as darkness fell , the tsunami waves continued sweeping into the town below them			0
the rescue workers on the hill left to begin their work and check on their own homes			0
the activists and the @entity4 woman who also made it to the hill took turns warming themselves in the cars			2
over the roar of the waves they heard a voice			0
" we could hear this woman screaming out in the water , " @entity3 said			2
" it was dim out there and all this debris was out there and then we could make out her form on a pile of debris			0
" the activists tried to reach her but were pushed back the waves still topping the tsunami wall			0
they commandeered an abandoned fire truck and the @entity4 woman with them used the loud speaker to call to fishing boats off the coast			1
" we quit hearing her , " @entity3 said of the trapped woman			2
" i do n't know if it was because she grew weary or from exhaustion or she floated too far away			0
but then her voice would come back			0
" the boats came near to where the woman was floating but the group could not make out if they rescued her			0
" we do n't know if the boats found her but we certainly hope they did , " @entity3 said			1
" we heard her voice no more and the sound of her pleas in @entity4 are a sound that will stay with me the rest of my life			2
" the next morning the group marched out of the town that was shrouded in a fog of burning wreckage and diesel			0
@entity3 calls it a journey through a " post-apocalyptic world			2
" the photos he took along the trip show enormous tsunami barriers torn and twisted by the waters , a person being plucked from a roof top by a rescue helicopter and fields of debris that were once people 's homes			1
and there are photos of a human body hanging in a tree			0
the group came across a teenager still in his school uniform wandering the debris fields			0
they tried to get him to come with them			0
unable to communicate with the activists , the teenager walked away in another direction			0
they finally made found a group of @entity4 people huddled over a campfire			1
their house was destroyed but they offered the travelers soup			0
@entity3 said they felt bad but receiving food from them but " it would have been rude to have refused and it was welcome			2
" @entity3 said he and his companions were only able to leave the devastation through the kindness of @entity4 people they encountered along their journey and who they could just barely communicate with			1
one man , @entity3 said , pantomimed for the group to stay put and then returned with cars to drive them from the disaster area			2
the @entity4 , @entity3 said , refused to take anything more than gas money			1
back at his home in @entity0 , @entity3 has been able to take a hot shower and sleep in a real bed if not yet fully absorb his ordeal			1
@entity3 's views on the porpoise hunts have n't changed			1
but he has invited many of the @entity4 people he knows to come stay in his family 's home as they try flee the damage and radiation released by the quake			1
he is more than 4,000 miles from @entity4 but still feels like he is on the hilltop being battered by the tsunami waves			2
" my wife 's been saying , ' what if ? ' i had n't really allowed myself to go there , " @entity3 said			1
" the six of us made it , we are fine , we are home with our families but so many other people did n't make it			2
