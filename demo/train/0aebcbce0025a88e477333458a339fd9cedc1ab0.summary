-- the gunman showed that he was human			2
most of the others who stalked the lobby of @entity6 's @entity5 were young , brash , hostile @entity8 diehards			1
yet this man in his 50s , armed with a @entity11 , longed to see his children			2
his kids were out there somewhere in the @entity16 capital , he said , gunfire and explosions erupting around them			2
" i really miss my family , too , " @entity0 producer @entity19 told him in @entity20			1
" i really want to go out and see my family			2
they 're worried about me			2
" tears welled in the gunman 's eyes			1
rebels were taking over the @entity16 capital			2
and this man , who had known nothing but the @entity8 regime for 42 years , wanted to go home , too			1
it was in this moment that @entity19 knew she had a chance			2
if the three dozen journalists being held against their will inside the five - star hotel for five days had a shot of being freed , it was now			1
at 29 , @entity19 has a lifetime of experience in hostile regions			2
a native of @entity43 who is fluent in @entity20 and @entity44 , she 's a stalwart of @entity0 's @entity46 bureau and known for her professionalism , persistence and persuasiveness			1
if you encounter trouble , you want her at your side			2
she 'd come to @entity16 weeks before , meeting up with @entity0 senior international correspondent @entity53			1
she 'd built relationships with the government officials , media minders and security in the hotel , including this gunman			2
now she and an @entity20 - speaking cameraman from another news organization were negotiating to secure the journalists ' safe release			1
on her @entity65 page , @entity19 lists her favorite quote : " life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well - preserved body , but rather to skid in sideways , thoroughly used up , totally worn out , champagne in one hand ... strawberries in the other and screaming : ' @entity77 ! what a ride ! ' " in the @entity5 , @entity19 was n't ready for life 's wild ride to end			1
phoning home to say goodbye it had become apparent days earlier that the journalists -- from an array of news organizations , including @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity91 's @entity90 -- were prisoners of a dying @entity8 regime			1
the government officials and minders who 'd monitored the journalists abandoned the hotel august 21			1
about 15 gunmen loyal to the regime remained behind , roaming the halls with @entity101 assault rifles			2
they told the journalists they could not leave the hotel			1
most of the loyalists were irritable , young , reckless			2
they adorned their weapons with the green flag of @entity8 's regime			1
to avoid contact with this volatile bunch , the journalists moved to an upper floor			1
a hotel chef initially took care of the group			2
one 21 - year - old gunman -- a " nice guy , " @entity19 says -- ran through the hotel with his jeans covered in the blood of his cousin , killed in the fighting outside			2
by monday , tensions between the journalists and their captors escalated			1
gunfire erupted outside the hotel , and smoke could be seen coming from the direction of @entity8 's nearby compound			1
" @entity132 spies , " they shouted			2
" there are spies amongst the journalists ! " they walked amid the journalists , their guns drawn			1
they were angry , bitter			2
" this could really turn out terribly for us , " chance thought			0
the journalists tried not to antagonize			1
" we all had a calm panic , if there is such a thing , " he recalled			0
the gunmen 's belligerence sparked paranoia " about being taken hostage , about being held prisoner , about being executed			1
" " it dawned on us : if they 'd been given orders to take us as prisoners or to execute us , there was nothing we could do			0
" that loss of control -- the realization that their fate rested with the men holding guns -- led to the darkest thoughts : that they would n't make it out alive			0
chance phoned his mother and wife to tell them what to do with his remains			0
his wife put his 5 - year - old daughter on the line			0
if this was a final goodbye , his only child needed to hear daddy 's voice			1
the veteran correspondent who has covered conflicts in the @entity187 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 did n't tell his girl about the danger he faced			1
he spoke instead of the new school year			0
" you 're going to start school in two weeks , " he said			0
" promise me that you 'll work really hard at school			0
" " yes , poppa , i promise you			0
" " be a good girl for me and mommy			0
" " poppa , i will			0
he was 2,000 miles from his home in @entity198			1
he wanted nothing more than to see his girl on her first day of school			0
he just was n't sure if he 'd make it			0
snipers fired into the hotel , shattering windows and rattling nerves			0
chance and the others spent 36 hours face - down on the floor with little food or water			1
with frequent power outages , it was difficult to follow the events of @entity6 outside the walls of the hotel			1
but work kept @entity53 focused			1
he tweeted using his smartphone , used a satellite phone or called friends and dictated his thoughts			1
at one point tuesday , he leaned over a balcony overlooking the hotel 's interior courtyard , which the gunmen patrolled			1
" i suppose you 're happy now that @entity16 are killing @entity16 , " one shouted			0
connecting " as a human " the sound of artillery fire pierced the morning calm wednesday			1
the gunmen had grown increasingly hostile the day before			0
the group worried about what lay in store			0
about 6 a.m. , all of the gunmen except the older one left the hotel			0
@entity19 and the arabic - speaking cameraman approached him			0
a day earlier , she had overheard him telling the younger gunmen to remain calm and be good to the journalists : " we want them to go back to their countries and say good things about us -- how @entity16 are brave people			1
" now @entity19 and the cameraman told him what they understood : @entity8 's regime had fallen			1
when a man who called himself a soldier entered the hotel , the gunman asked about the situation outside			1
" you were out there			0
tell me , what 's really going on ? is it what they are telling us ? " yes , he was told			1
the rebels were indeed in control			0
@entity8 's rule of @entity16 was over			1
@entity19 seized the moment with an emotional plea			0
her family missed her , she told him , as did the families of the three dozen other journalists			1
" think about your kids , " she said			0
" you 're left here alone			0
" at first , the man defended @entity8 , saying that he had brought democracy to @entity16 , that the nation thrived under his leadership			0
earlier , he 'd told @entity19 that he was protecting the journalists			1
that he wanted his children to know that he 'd fight to the end			1
@entity19 and the cameraman reminded him that all the senior officials -- and now even his young comrades -- had abandoned him			0
it was time to give up			0
" slowly , he started to change			0
" the cameraman slowly stripped the soldier and gunman of their weapons			1
now unarmed , the man looked at the journalists and said , " you can go now			1
" @entity19 immediately began negotiating with the @entity299 to get cars to the hotel			0
before she left , she told the man goodbye			0
" @entity19 , get out of here , " he said			0
there will be a bloodbath for years to come			0
" chance watched nearby as his colleague talked with the guard			0
" i watched this transformation these guys made from being @entity8 hardliners to realizing that his regime was a historically past moment			0
that was a remarkable transition to witness			0
" i think it 's the most moving part of this whole crisis			1
" says @entity19 : " in the end , we 're all human			1
and that 's what this was about , connecting with him as a human			2
" stepping outside the @entity5 , the journalists worried about snipers			1
cars with the @entity87 and the @entity299 pulled up			0
all journalists are out ! " chance tweeted			2
in the car , he called @entity0			1
speeding through @entity6 , he described the end of their hellish ordeal			1
@entity19 sat next to him , tears streaming down her face , the weight of recent days crashing down			0
" we would n't be here if it were n't for her , " chance said later			0
but @entity19 praised the cameraman			0
" it was a team effort			0
" chance 's daughter will soon see her poppa			2
he plans to be home for her first day of school september 5			2
but first he stopped at the newly named @entity355 , where joyous @entity6 residents showered him with flowers			1
" they 're not celebrating my freedom , " he said			0
" they 're celebrating @entity16 's freedom			2
" @entity19 was struck by the disparate scene from a week ago , when @entity6 was filled with unhappy faces			1
today , she noted , everyone seemed to wear smiles			0
@entity8 's images have been torn down			2
" i came out to a new @entity16 , " she said			0
on thursday , the day after her release , she did the unthinkable			0
she returned to the hotel to gather her personal belongings			0
" i got a bit freaked out when we got close , " she said			0
" but the first thing i saw was a rebel flag hanging on the @entity5			1
" soon , she was back in a car , crossing the border into @entity376 , headed home			2
as she 'd told the gunman , she longs to see her loved ones			0
