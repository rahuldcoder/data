-- so , you 're leaving your job			1
maybe you 're finally going to start that @entity4 - themed coffee shop / art space / bowling alley you keep talking about			2
or maybe this is the year your indie @entity7 jazz rock band will finally make it big			2
perhaps you freaked out on some hapless @entity10 airline passenger and are gon na be grounded for a bit			2
or maybe -- drag , dude -- the employment gods decided that you ( along with 131,000 workers in july alone ) are gon na have a liiitle extra free time to enjoy the end of summer			1
either way , when it comes time to kiss your cubicle goodbye , you can scamper away , firmly ensconced in your @entity21 like a gerbil in a clear plastic ball , or you can tie up digital loose ends and depart with dignity			1
first things first : you need to tell the world -- and especially your officemates -- that you 're leaving			2
it 's tempting to walk out of that awkward meeting with your boss , the sight of her crumpled frustration and disappointment at losing one of her best employees ( right ) still fresh in your mind , and tap out the tweet or @entity46 status update you 've been dreaming about for years : " f * * * yeah , i 'm @entity32 ! " a classier step : tell the important people ( the ones who 'd want to hear it from the horse 's mouth ) in person or via personalized calls or e-mails , then compose a @entity46 status asking your friends and colleagues to celebrate with you at a local watering hole			1
post it on your wall and let the congrats roll in			0
a mass e-mail to relatives and networking contacts is fine , too -- just keep it brief , say nothing but classy things about your former employer , and be prepared to write a battery of " thanks , yeah , i 'm excited ! " responses when your e-mail hits peeps ' inboxes			1
( if your exit was less , er , voluntary , the same principles apply : " celebratory " drinks become " commiseration " cocktails , and the mass e-mail becomes more of a polite plea for networking leads			1
) after you 've gotten woefully drunk with friends and colleagues , it comes time to bid your co-workers adieu			1
yeah , you have 4 million things to think about after you give ( or are given ) your two weeks ' notice ( like how to steal as many office supplies as possible before the final punch - out )			0
but saying your goodbyes , handing out your contact information and digitally setting up a few easy streams of continued connection mean you wo n't turn into that " hey , whatever happened to that guy ? " guy			0
so do not go gentle into that good night			0
you already know to write your boss a handwritten card ( even though up to 40 percent of men want to punch their bosses in the face , according to a lovely new survey from @entity103 and @entity104 ) , right ? but how to handle the rest of the herd ? definitely walk around and shake hands with everyone you can on your last day			1
( you may wish to avoid interrupting everyone 's menial - labor stupor to let them know you 're heading out , but do it anyway			1
the murmurs of " that bee - yotch did n't even say goodbye " are ultimately much more damaging )			0
in addition , in most offices it 's cool to send a mass e-mail ( to the entire staff , if you worked with everyone , or at least to everyone who knows who you are ) as your very last missive from your soon - to - be - defunct work e-mail address			1
thank them all for being wonderful and encourage them to keep in touch			0
finishing on a warm note makes it that much more likely that they 'll think of you when a new position 's open and you 're miserably toiling away at your new job -- you know , instead of just recalling the time you came to work early to print out the 200 - page application for " @entity138 ? " and broke the printer			1
also in said e-mail , provide your personal e-mail address and phone number as a separate @entity143 , ( no , not that kinda v - card , interneteur -- electronic business cards			1
) instructions vary by e-mail client , but usually involve making a new contact for yourself and forwarding that out from your address book			1
then recipients can just open up your e-business card to permanently have all your info			0
you can also exchange info via apps like @entity156 , which allows you to trade contacts , pictures , etc and connect via social networks by tapping your phones together			0
and now that @entity162 has integrated bump , you can finally get all that poker money back from @entity165 in finance			0
lastly , do n't let your onetime colleagues forget you			0
we 're not suggesting an epic , last - day , one - man show involving blowhorns and a mariachi band			2
or an email to the entire office gleefully revealing how your @entity176 - playing boss wiled away his days -- as in the viral hit from earlier this week which , sadly , turned out to be a hoax			0
( although that would be a pretty epic note on which to leave )			2
rather , our point is : most people do n't burn bridges , but they do let them rot			0
so keep the bridge strong ( to continue the hoary clich√© ) by sending occasional check - in e-mails and , if appropriate , following colleagues on @entity189 in the hope they 'll follow you back			0
that way they pretty much ca n't forget you , as your smart retweets and interesting links will flick you into their consciousness a few times a day			2
just do n't drunk - tweet about how your five - month dry spell is making you wonder why you went back on the pill in the first place			0

when it 's time to leave your job , tie up digital loose ends and depart with dignity
walk around and shake hands with everyone you can on your last day
provide your personal e-mail address and phone number as a separate @entity143
