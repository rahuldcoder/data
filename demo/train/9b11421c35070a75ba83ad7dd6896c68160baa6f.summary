when techno - whiz @entity1 left @entity3 for the @entity4 in 1991 , he had never used a computer before			2
but two decades later , he 's using the power of technology to provide computer literacy to the children of rural @entity11 , one refurbished computer at a time			2
@entity1 is the founder of the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , a @entity15 - based charitable organization that donates reconditioned old computers and accessories from the developed world and delivers them to those schools in need in the developing world			1
" we try to put the computers there as electronic tools , also as a library , also to a place where not just the school but the entire villages around that school can come in and benefit from the computer , " says @entity1 , who moved to the @entity4 at the age of 24			2
underwater cables bring faster internet to @entity11 growing up under difficult conditions in rural @entity3 , @entity1 was inspired at a young age by a group of missionaries who visited his school , willing to make a long and difficult journey to help strangers			1
he says that that incident has motivated him ever since to try and make a difference in the lives of others			0
" it showed me that regardless of how little you have , you can do something for somebody which can be great for their life and their future , " says @entity1			0
since 2004 , @entity13 says it has built and donated 25 computer labs in village schools and communities in @entity3 and @entity57 for a total of 233 computers			1
the non-profit organization is funded entirely by @entity1 , his family and a small pool of committed donors			0
but besides money , @entity1 , who did computer studies in the @entity4 and now works for an electronics company in @entity15 , also dedicates his personal time , putting a lot of hard work on the project that 's become his mission in life			0
using the monitor - crammed garage of his house in @entity15 as his base , he tests , fixes and upgrades all the donated computers himself before shipping them to @entity11			2
he says it 's all worth it : " i feel very excited because it takes a lot to do it and finally when you get it done like this it 's just joy , " says @entity1			2
" you feel overjoyed because finally you know that you 've reached the destination and somebody is going to benefit from all the hard work that you have to put in , " he adds			0
web savvy @entity92 fuel growth in online shopping but @entity13 goes much further than just shipping hardware to @entity92 villages			0
the group also runs training workshops for teachers and students and provides technical support , maintaining an ongoing relationship with the recipients of their computers			1
" when we do the donation , we enter into a three - calendar year agreement with the kids , with the school , to go back and fix them and make sure everything is working for the next three years , " says @entity1 , who runs @entity13 with the help of four volunteers in @entity3			1
the non-profit organization also promotes local involvement and development , trumpeting @entity1 's belief that an entire community benefits when computers are introduced in local schools			1
" the whole concept about our donation process is first , not just the computers , but getting the entire community involved in the process " he says			1
" that makes them part of the process , so they know the kids are learning and so they can feel proud to have them go to school rather than tell them to go to the farm			0
" @entity3 farmers lose out in gold mining boom @entity1 has visited his native @entity3 11 times after the launch of @entity13 -- there , he does n't only organize computer workshops but he 's also giving motivational speeches and raises awareness about issues such as @entity143 and teenage pregnancy			1
he says that his goal is to run @entity13 as a full - time project and be able to bring his work to many more rural areas across @entity11 -- he 's currently working to implement the project in @entity150 but admits that he has had to turn down calls for help from people in other @entity92 countries due to funding difficulties and logistics issues			1
yet , despite all the difficulties , @entity1 is determined to carry on with his dream of introducing the world of computers to children across @entity11			1
he hopes that by re-building old computers , he will also be give them the tools to compete globally			0
" if we want to change the world we have to start by changing the people who are going to be the world tomorrow , who are the kids , " says @entity1			0
" so any seed we sow today are what 's going to bloom tomorrow to shape our world and make a better world , so anything that you can do , regardless of how little it is , goes toward making the world a better place , " he adds .			0
