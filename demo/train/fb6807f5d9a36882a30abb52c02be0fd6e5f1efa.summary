-- @entity1 remembers all too vividly the moment that shrapnel from a roadside bomb in @entity5 tore into his body and left his right arm dangling uselessly			2
despite being seriously wounded , the staff sergeant was still yelling orders to alert others to the danger , but it was already too late and one of his men had died			1
" there was not a lot of pain , i was drifting in and out of consciousness and someone was tapping me on the forehead to tell me to keep awake , " he tells @entity0			2
@entity23 had been leading an 18 - strong patrol of the @entity26 @entity25 in the city of @entity28 when he was hit by the blast			1
" i was taken to a field hospital in @entity31 -- laying there in my hospital bed with this contraption on my arm , " he recalls			2
@entity23 was presented with his @entity35 and then shipped out to @entity36 and eventually home to the @entity26 as a result of his injuries , @entity23 's army career was over and he was given a medical discharge			1
' helplessness ' coming to terms with that life - changing event was tough enough , but it was the " survivor 's guilt " that played tricks with his mind and mental state			1
private first class @entity53 of @entity55 , @entity56 , just 19 years of age , had died that day , april 8 , 2006 and @entity23 blamed himself			2
" i was just racked with guilt , in the sense that i failed as a leader and take responsibility for what happened			0
" @entity23 was in a bad place			0
his marriage would eventually break down			0
" it 's a big challenge for returning veterans to learn how to integrate with their families , " he admits			1
now 38 , he has two children , and his youngest -- his daughter -- was born five months after he was injured			0
" i battled three or four years of just helplessness , anxiety and depression , until i was introduced to the @entity73 , " @entity23 says			0
aimed at helping injured service members , and raising awareness in the community , it brought him together with @entity78 -- who also joined the army in the mid- 1990s and who was also seriously wounded on duty			1
" he had such a positive attitude and he really encouraged me to turn my life around , " @entity23 says			0
@entity78 's arm had been severed when a rocket - propelled grenade pierced the armor plating of his vehicle			1
he suffered other life - threatening injuries , and a lacerated liver , spending months in the @entity92 in @entity93 where @entity23 would be sent two years later			1
" i remember i woke up from my coma and essentially thinking this is not really how i want to live , " @entity78 tells @entity0			0
" i did n't want to live , and for the first time in my life i was scared			0
" the power of golf like @entity23 , his army days were over and with discharge came the same sense of helplessness and loss			0
@entity78 also found support and renewed sense of purpose after being introduced to the @entity73			0
by chance , he was given his first set of golf clubs and the opportunity to have a go at the game , despite his disability			0
" i played horribly , but i connected perfectly with just one shot -- just one shot and i was hooked , " he recalls			0
" i 've loved the game ever since and used it as a vital tool to aid my recovery			0
" @entity23 had also dabbled with the game before his life - changing incident and , like @entity78 , has found some inner peace while walking the 18 holes of his local courses in northern @entity125			1
but like a lot of amateur golfers , he suffers from a common problem			0
" i had a terrible slice and now with the injury to my right arm , i still have a slice ! " on monday , slice or no slice , both will be hoping to take their " a game " to a nationwide tournament which has the express purpose of raising money for the @entity140 charity			1
@entity143 's @entity142 ( @entity144 ) is the brain child of legendary golfer @entity147 's organization and its ceo , @entity148			1
this year more than 150 courses in the @entity26 will be used for an event with an expected 15,000 entrants , all playing in teams of four			1
unlike conventional tournaments , the prizes are reserved for the participants who raise the most money for the @entity157 , not those with the lowest scores			1
@entity144 has raised over $ 1 million for veterans since starting four years ago , and is rapidly expanding			1
" we 've hit a chord within the golfing community , " @entity148 tells @entity0			0
" @entity26 are passionate about assisting these brave individuals			1
" finding closure @entity23 will be playing at @entity166 in @entity125 , where he will be pressed into speaking duties before the tournament starts			0
a regular on the dais at veterans ' days , he eloquently espouses their cause and the benefits of @entity157			1
what happened that fateful day in @entity5 changed his life forever , and it was only last year that he was able to exorcise some of the demons and guilt about the death of his colleague @entity184			0
@entity53 's family invited @entity23 to visit and pay his respects , something he had been unable to do in 2006 because he was in hospital recovering from his injuries			1
@entity23 recalled in his personal blog the moment he first saw @entity184 's grave site , writing : " i was cold , nearly shivering			1
i stood and saluted him while tears rolled down my face			0
" my first thought was that i wished i was in the ground instead of him ... but at that instant i was overcome with a hot burning sensation and i realized @entity53 would n't want me to think like that ... " i promised him that it would n't be another seven years before i came back			0
i stood and saluted him one final time and walked away			0
" @entity78 , who works full - time for @entity157 , will perform similar speaking duties at 1757 @entity205 in @entity206 , @entity207 before showing off his golfing skills			1
" i usually break a hundred			0
i 've found my own technique , " he says			0
" the furthest i 've ever hit a drive is 280 yards , i normally strike it out about 230			0
" breaking down barriers @entity78 is thankful for his every moment after his near brush with death , and always thankful to @entity157 from rescuing him from the depths of despair			0
the project was formed in 2003 to give support to wounded @entity26 service personnel since the events of september 11 , 2001			1
nearly 40,000 veterans and their families have benefited from its various programs and fundraising efforts			2
the @entity144 's association has proved the perfect fit , and @entity148 believes golf is also benefiting from opening up its courses to people who might not normally be attracted to the sport			1
competitors pay a standard green fee and $ 10 donation to @entity157 to play prestigious courses and to get a taste for the game			2
" it 's broken down the some of the barriers to people who want to play golf , particularly women , who are worried about too many rules and too much protocol , " @entity148 says			2
he has big ambitions for the concept and is even considering an expansion outside of the @entity26			1
" i see no reason why we could not play on thousands of courses , on a monday each year in august , with hundreds of thousand of golfers coming to support their heroes and to raise millions of dollars in a day			2
" having already presented a check for $ 735,000 in january , @entity148 hopes this year 's fundraising will break through the $ 1 million mark			2
" it 's a great way to raise money and awareness for the @entity157 , " @entity78 says			1
he plays most weekends , sometimes with other veterans , enjoying the solitude and the chance to talk , share experiences			2
" you ca n't have a bad day on a golf course , " says the 41 - year - old			2
" being a warrior you want to compete whatever the event , still up for the challenge			2
