floating in the middle of the sea , the first thing we noticed was the vast expanse of tarmac , roughly the size of three soccer fields			2
and then we heard the loud blasting sound of fighter jets preparing to take off			0
this was one of the world 's most powerful warships , the @entity16 ' super carrier ' @entity18 @entity17 , which the @entity11 crew and members of other media organizations were granted a rare opportunity to visit this weekend			1
after climbing up the equivalent of an eight - story building , staircase after staircase , one narrow hallway after another , we finally arrived at the " bridge , " an elevated tower containing the command control center on the aircraft carrier			2
the @entity35 nuclear - powered carrier was in the waters off the @entity37 for a routine patrol mission , which followed a trilateral " search and rescue " drill between the @entity35 , @entity40 and @entity41			1
the drill drew harsh rhetoric from @entity44 earlier last week , warning the @entity35 of a " horrible disaster " and claimed that its troops are on high alert to promptly cope with " blatant provocations			0
" standing on the flight deck of the @entity18 @entity17 , i realized @entity44 probably had good reason to be on edge			1
the @entity18 @entity17 can carry about 80 aircraft , launch tactical fighter jets towards any location and is equipped with various types of missiles			1
known as a " floating military base " , it can also accommodate more than 6,000 crew , serve 18,000 meals per day and even has live broadcast television on the vessel			1
back on the bridge , we saw fighter jets take off one after another at an impressive pace			0
this , i was told , was the work of a deck catapult , which slings the fighter jet forward , generating enormous speed			0
ending the tour , we strapped ourselves into a propeller - powered , windowless plane			0
after a roaring sound , the plane took off at an enormous speed , faster than any roller coaster ride i had been on			0
