-- the @entity1 is investigating how two @entity3 flags that fly at the top of the @entity5 were replaced by two white flags			1
the swapped - out flags were spotted by construction workers at 5:30 a.m. tuesday , @entity1 deputy commissioner for intelligence @entity7 said at a news conference tuesday afternoon			1
he said members of the @entity14 found two flags , one on each tower of the bridge , that appeared to be @entity3 flags that had been bleached white			1
the workers also found large aluminum pans affixed as covers over the lights and secured with zip ties , @entity7 added			0
the @entity1 's @entity24 , the @entity25 and the @entity14 were on the bridge as the white flags were removed , according to an @entity1 detective			1
" at this time , it appears it has no particular nexus to terrorism or even politics , " @entity7 said			0
" this may be somebody 's art project , or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement , but at this point it 's not clear what that statement is			0
" @entity1 police commissioner @entity43 called the incident a matter of concern and said that police are requesting the help of the public as they continue to look across social media for claims of responsibility			1
@entity7 said that the @entity1 has video that shows a number of people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. tuesday and within the hour , the light that normally illuminates the flag on the @entity5 side of the bridge flickered and appeared to go out and a few minutes later the same thing occurred on the @entity63 tower			1
@entity7 added that he believes the bleached flags were made at home and that whoever did this might have had some climbing or construction experience			0
" there is a standard level of security at the bridge ; apparently that security failed this morning or last night			2
perhaps more security is needed , " a @entity1 detective familiar with the investigation said			1
@entity7 said that there are two @entity1 vehicles at each end of the bridge at all times , and after the news conference told reporters that the department is looking at putting @entity1 cameras on the bridge			2
should the incident just prove to be a stunt , some people do n't find the humor			0
" if flying a white flag atop the @entity5 is someone 's idea of a joke , i 'm not laughing , " @entity93 president @entity92 said in a statement			1
" the public safety of our city is of paramount importance , particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high - risk targets			0
" @entity92 announced at a news conference tuesday that he is offering a reward of $ 5,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person or people responsible			0
@entity113 councilman @entity112 tweeted a photo of the flags tuesday morning			0
" i drive over the @entity5 often , i thought , what the heck is that about ? " @entity112 told @entity0			1
" i 'm curious and i 'm also concerned if it was vandals			0
" the @entity5 opened in 1883 and at that time was the longest suspension bridge , according to the @entity120			2
it has been designated a @entity121 by the @entity122 , and a @entity123 by the @entity123			0
