-- @entity1 is known as one of the fittest players in tennis , but even the rejuvenated @entity5 is feeling anxious as she prepares to take part in the @entity7 in early november			1
@entity1 admits to having nightmares about the grueling 26.2 - mile race , which comes just a week after the season - ending @entity10 finals conclude in @entity11			1
" i dreamed one time that before i even got to the start line i was dead , " @entity1 laughs during an interview with @entity0 's @entity13			1
" or i dreamed that someone had to get me through the finish line in a wheelchair			0
" so i do n't know if i am that confident but i 'm starting to get there			2
i definitely have a finish goal in mind but i want to keep it to myself			0
" @entity1 is competing in the marathon for charity , capping a rollercoaster 2014 in which the former world no. 1 suffered an array of injuries and a high - profile split with top golfer @entity30 before making her first grand slam final in five years at the @entity32			1
she then continued her resurgence with good form on the @entity10 's @entity36 swing , clinching a place at the elite eight - woman championships for the first time since 2011			0
" the running has definitely helped , " she says			0
" in the middle of the year i had a tough time outside the court and in my personal life			2
" just going for a run was nice to clear my mind and think about something else			0
then you feel great about yourself as well			0
" still , if you think @entity1 is crazy for deciding to take part this year after tennis ' tiring 10 - month hop around the world , you are n't alone			1
her dad and fitness coach both thought the same			0
" they said , ' you are crazy , ' " @entity1 says			1
and while two - time grand slam winner @entity58 plans to one day run a marathon , he wo n't do it until he is retired			1
" that 's an amazing effort , she 's doing that while playing , because it takes a lot of training , a lot of hard work , " he told reporters in @entity63 in august			0
@entity1 brought up the idea during a grass - court tournament in @entity72 , @entity73 in june , where her career revival began			1
" i was sitting there with my dad and my team and i was like , ' hey , i 'm going to run the @entity7 ' and my dad was like , ' no you are not , ' " says @entity1 , now ranked ninth			1
" so i made the phone call right there and then to my agent @entity81 ( @entity85 ) and i said , ' @entity81 , look up charities i can run for			0
' " he was like , ' funny joke ' and i said , ' it 's not a joke , i 'm serious			0
' he came with a list that evening and i checked them out			0
" @entity1 eventually settled on @entity93 , which according to the @entity95 ' website , provides " free low - cost health and fitness programs to kids who would otherwise have little or no access to regular physical activity			1
" sports has always been an important part of the @entity1 family , with dad @entity104 a former pro footballer , mom @entity105 a former volleyball player and brother @entity107 also into football in @entity109			1
running a marathon had always been on her " bucket list , " too , although it seems unlikely that @entity1 would have participated this year had she and @entity30 not gone their separate ways			1
it was @entity30 who broke off the engagement			1
they were reportedly due to wed in november -- in @entity119			2
@entity1 has stepped up her training while maintaining a full tennis schedule -- prior to losing to @entity122 in last month 's final at @entity124 she told reporters how she believed it had helped her on - court fitness			1
she has run a half - marathon and through tennis may be equipped to deal with the " mental battle " faced by distance runners			2
" i know the marathon is breathing down my neck so i know i need to get out and run and it 's great for me , " she says			2
" i think running a marathon is very mental			2
it 's definitely a mental battle with yourself out there and i think that 's the same on the tennis court			2
" sometimes you are hitting the wall out there and you ca n't seem to get the points together but you just need to keep focusing , take one point at a time and somehow you manage to turn it around			0
i think it 's the same in the marathon			0
" her reward when she gets to the finish line ? " i told my friends and my manager to have chocolate and some sweets waiting for me , " she said			0
" we are definitely going to go out for a very unhealthy dinner afterwards			0

@entity1 wo n't be done exercising when the tennis season is over
the @entity5 will be taking part in the @entity7 on november 2
@entity1 has had nightmares about the marathon but that is n't stopping her
after splitting with @entity30 and getting over injuries , @entity1 *prospered* on court
