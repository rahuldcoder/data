-- just days after giving birth to her second child , dr. @entity1 drove herself home from the hospital to find her then - husband in bed with another woman			0
he threw @entity1 down the stairs , and she never saw him again until court			0
@entity10 was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend , singer @entity11 , before the @entity12 on february 8			0
@entity1 , now an obstetrician - gynecologist at @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , had been in an abusive relationship with her husband in @entity18 for 4½ years until he pushed her out 11 years ago			0
" emotionally , the remnants of that stay for a long time , " she said			0
domestic violence is the most common cause of injury to women ages 15 to 44 , according to the @entity26			1
with the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation @entity10 , whose boyfriend @entity11 has been formally charged with assaulting her , public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated			1
abuse can influence a victim 's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships , depending on whether the victim stays or leaves , said @entity38 , a clinical psychologist based in @entity40 , @entity41			1
those who stay are likely to stop trusting their own perceptions and become passive in both romantic and nonromantic relationships			0
victims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice , @entity38 said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict , even verbal disputes , at all costs			0
some women wo n't trust people easily , if at all , and wo n't be able to handle even normal expressions of anger			1
@entity55 , your connection to better living " what they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they 're aware of their own anger , and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy , normal way , " he said			0
" if somebody 's still having issues 10 years later , they just have n't worked through it			0
they have n't healed ; they need to do that			0
" new research shows that abuse victims feel the impact of violence long after it occurred			2
a recent study in the @entity82 found that older @entity85 - @entity84 women who were exposed to high levels of family violence at some point in their lifetimes -- whether by a partner or family member -- are at a greater risk of poor mental and physical health status			1
" not just ongoing violence , which everybody thinks about , but even when it 's over , there 's something about what happens that seems to have a lingering effect that we do n't quite understand yet , " said dr. @entity94 , co-author of the study and associate professor at @entity97			1
it makes sense that abused women would report worse health , given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones , which interfere with immune function , @entity38 said			1
other studies show a clear connection between depression and abuse			2
adult women who have been abused in a relationship in the past five years have rates of depression 2½ times greater than women who have never been abused , according to a different study of more than 3,000 women			1
they are also more likely to be socially isolated , said author @entity127 , associate professor at the @entity128			0
women who have been abused prior to , but not during , the past five years had depression rates 1½ times greater than those without abuse experience , said @entity127 , who has collaborated with @entity1 on research on abused women			1
" people like to sort of think that , ' well , abuse is just when you have a black eye , you sustain a broken bone , ' " @entity127 said			0
" but we see lots of different effects in other areas , like depression and social isolation , and we 've actually proven that with the data			2
" women who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse , but it 's unclear how the two are related -- one does n't necessarily cause the other , and there could be other factors involved , @entity127 said			1
a 2008 study of 3,333 women , which @entity127 worked on , found that middle - aged women who suffered child abuse , sexual or other physical abuse , had a greater likelihood of depression , as well as a higher body mass index			1
these women also spend up to one - third more than average on health care costs			2
about 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused			1
while @entity94 's study found that women with the highest levels of abuse reported having poor health , the same number of diseases were reported among those women as the women in the sample who had less or no abuse			1
this indicates that there is something else that makes abused women report feeling unwell , she said			1
" when your patient says they do n't feel so good , you might want to think about asking what other issues may be going on , " she said			2
people who have gotten out of a relationship should go through the work of learning what issues set them up in that situation , and reflect on the warning signs , @entity38 said			0
experts recommend finding a counselor and other means of support , but people who have been abused should think twice about revealing too much in online support groups , because their abusers could discover what they 're saying , @entity1 said			2
research has also shown that violence escalates in abusive relationships among couples who go to marriage counseling , she said			2
some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse , @entity1 said			0
she herself found healing through advocacy and research on the subject , she said			0
calling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse , @entity1 said			1
" whether you 're a pop star or somebody that 's working front lines -- an employee at a grocery store selling the pop star magazine -- you 're at equal risk for having this , " she said .			0
