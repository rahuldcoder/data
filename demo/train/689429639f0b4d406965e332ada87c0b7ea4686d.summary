-- as a father of three , i felt @entity4 ' pain as she spoke about her son @entity5			1
he is 22 years old and six feet tall , with a goatee			2
but like most mothers , she still sees her son as a little boy			1
when i visited her at her home in @entity12 , @entity13 , she was delighted to show off her scrapbooks filled with pictures from his childhood			2
she told me @entity5 loved anything where he could use his hands			2
he played football , baseball and basketball and did karate			2
in ninth grade , she told me with pride , he aced his classes one term , and made the dean 's list			1
every day when his father came home from work , @entity5 was there , ready			2
the pair used to ride dirt bikes together			2
when the family had to sell the bikes to save some money , it crushed @entity5			0
he told me he would have done anything to spend a little more time with his father			0
in fact , when @entity5 bought two guns a couple of years later , his plan was to give one to his father for @entity45			1
it would be something else they could do together , he thought			0
but things did n't work out that way			0
@entity5 spent that @entity45 in prison instead			1
his parents told police @entity5 had purchased two assault rifles at @entity55			1
they warned authorities he had been hospitalized several times while struggling with mental illness			1
@entity4 believes that was her son 's only crime			1
he did n't shoot anyone or hurt anyone in any way			0
and yet he is serving two concurrent 15 - year prison sentences , in lockdown for 23 hours a day			1
he was convicted of first - degree assault and armed criminal action			1
he will spend the prime of his life in prison			1
it 's time to talk about mental health @entity4 and her husband , @entity74 , laid their lives bare in an unforgettable interview that left me stunned			1
they let me talk to @entity5 's doctors to get a better understanding of @entity5 's mindset and diagnoses			1
they also gave me permission to visit @entity86 in the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity13 , the maximum security prison he now calls home , so i could ask all my questions and draw my own conclusions			1
@entity5 's story is really about the bizarre convergence between our prison system and our mental health system			1
he was diagnosed with dyslexia as a kid and placed on the autism spectrum as a teenager			0
around his junior year in high school , @entity5 developed signs of a true personality disorder			1
he had trouble communicating with others , started to have trouble with his grades and developed a profound and painful loneliness			0
my breath stuck in my throat when he described a semester where he hid away in a school bathroom every day to eat his lunch alone because he was shy , did n't have any friends and did n't know how to make them			0
his parents took him to doctor after doctor , and within two years , he had nearly a dozen different psychiatric diagnoses and a handful of psychotropic medications to go along with them			1
getting their son admitted and treated was the @entity4 ' goal , and given that @entity74 worked as the director of radiology at a local hospital , they thought it was an attainable one			1
the number of psychiatric beds has been on a steady decline over the last few decades , according to @entity133			0
back in 1960 , there were 535,000 public psychiatric beds nationwide			0
when the @entity137 were trying to get their son help in 2010 , there were 43,318 -- less than 10 % compared with 50 years earlier			1
sharing experiences with mental illness can help the couple looked into private camps , but the nearly $ 100,000 price tag was not within their reach			1
" the mental health system is not fractured -- it is totally broken , " @entity146 told me			1
as we reported this story and talked to experts in psychiatry , criminal justice and law enforcement , the same questions came up again and again : should people like @entity157 be prisoners or patients ? and how do you reasonably distinguish between the two ? when @entity4 pleaded with the judge in january , he told her 70 % of the people that stood in front of him suffered from mental illness			1
a review from the @entity167 shows that startling statistic to be a national trend , particularly among younger inmates			0
in the @entity172 , 70 % of local jail inmates 24 and under have been diagnosed with mental health problems			2
when police brought @entity5 in for questioning about his gun purchase , the nation was in the aftermath of the 2012 @entity178 , @entity179 , movie theater shooting			2
everyone was on high alert , anxious to prevent another awful tragedy			0
during interrogation , @entity5 admitted to buying a ticket to the movie " @entity187 " and he admitted to having homicidal thoughts a few years earlier at the age of 16			0
that alone was enough to put him behind bars with a prosecution team convinced they had just prevented a massacre			0
it was a sharp contrast to what his family and his doctors described to me			0
scientists link 60 genes to autism risk his psychologist @entity203 describes @entity5 as a model patient			0
he told me he never saw @entity206 as a threat and said @entity5 never got into a fight or tried to break the rules			0
he told me @entity5 's autism made it difficult for him to connect with others , and he saw a boy desperate for love and attention			2
his parents each told me they could n't imagine @entity5 ever hurting or killing anyone with the guns he purchased			2
according to a recent study in the journal @entity223 , patients with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators			1
and when they are violent , it is most often directed at themselves			0
@entity5 's psychiatrist dr. @entity229 pointed out that unlike a patient with diabetes , @entity5 will not get treatment for his illness in prison and will likely leave worse off than when he went in			1
near the end of my interview with @entity4 , i realized there was another reason for her pain			1
she had been the one to alert the authorities about @entity5 buying the guns			0
she found a receipt in his pocket and became worried			0
she told me @entity5 had asked her just days before if she felt he was a failure in life			0
she says it was n't a mass homicide that concerned her but a lonely suicide			0
we all worry about our kids , and we strive for their happiness , first and foremost			0
the @entity4 family is no different , and in this case @entity74 and @entity4 believe they failed their son			1
his father wonders out loud if he should have spent more time with his boy and less time traveling			0
he wonders if there were signs he should have seen			0
he second - guesses his decision not to mortgage his home to pay for a special camp so many summers ago			2
he wonders if he should have kept those dirt bikes			0
when i reminded him @entity5 bought the guns as a present , with the hope he could one day spend more time with his father , @entity74 was at a loss for words			2
@entity0 's @entity273 contributed to this report			2

@entity157 ' parents turned him in to police after he bought 2 assault rifles
his mom , @entity4 , says mental illness is her son 's only crime
@entity157 is serving two concurrent 15 - year prison sentences
