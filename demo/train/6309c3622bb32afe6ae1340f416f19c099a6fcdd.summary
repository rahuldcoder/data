@entity0 -- with just over a week to go before the first presidential debate , both campaigns are weighing what they can do to take advantage of the three head - to - head matchups in october that will help decide the race			1
@entity9 pollster @entity8 said @entity9 nominee @entity10 must use the debates to " score points " on the economy , the no. 1 concern of voters			1
" the most important thing that @entity10 can do is give people confidence that he knows how to fix this economy , " @entity8 told @entity1 's @entity16 on " @entity17			2
" " they do n't believe ( president @entity23 ) @entity23 has or can , but they are not yet persuaded that @entity10 can either			1
that 's the most important thing to come out of your debate			2
" while national polls like @entity29 show @entity23 and @entity10 neck and neck , recent ones in @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 -- key battleground states that will help determine the winner in november -- show the president pulling ahead , with much closer contests in @entity41 and @entity42			1
that could make it harder for @entity10 to do what analysts say he must to win the @entity47 -- carry all the states sen. @entity48 did in 2008 , plus about half a dozen that @entity23 turned from red to blue			1
battleground polls seem to give @entity23 upper hand with the conventions over , the debates are the last opportunity for the two candidates to reach the kind of large television audiences that could help them win over the dwindling number of undecided voters and energize their bases			1
on @entity65 's " @entity64 , " conservative writer @entity63 said the debates would be important " not because @entity10 is such a fabulous orator , but to the contrary -- for the first time , @entity67 will be able to see @entity10 unfiltered			1
and i think it will make a big difference			0
" and @entity73 sen. @entity72 said on " @entity17 " that the former @entity75 governor was " in good shape " and the debates would help shift the focus from perceived gaffes and missteps made by @entity10 in recent weeks -- most notably his remarks calling 47 % of the @entity67 population " victims " who are dependent on the government -- to @entity23 's record			1
@entity72 : it 's about your bank account , not @entity10 's @entity90 account former president @entity91 told @entity1 's @entity92 that @entity10 would have to explain the " 47 % " comments in the debates			1
the challenge for the president is to convince doubters , some of whom may have been supporters in 2008 , that his policies will succeed in turning the economy around			0
" we 've got an electorate that is disappointed in the president they elected in 2008 , but not at all convinced that the @entity9 challenger offers a good alternative , " @entity103 @entity0 bureau chief @entity102 told @entity16			0
@entity23 campaign senior adviser @entity110 continued to try to lower expectations for the president on " @entity113			1
" " i think it 's always a big moment when two candidates get to sit side by side and answer the same question , " he said			0
" @entity10 i think has an advantage , because he 's been through 20 of these debates in the primaries over the last year			1
he even bragged that he was declared the winner in 16 of those debates			0
so i think , in that sense , having been through this much more recently than president @entity23 , i think he starts with an advantage			2
" in other quarters , the discussion turned to whether the @entity10 campaign needed to make changes			1
@entity36 gov. @entity131 survived a recall election with the help of a strong @entity9 ground game that the @entity23 campaign believes is benefiting @entity10 in that traditionally blue state			1
@entity131 said he wanted to see more passion from the @entity9 contender and suggested he needed to spend more time campaigning			0
" i think you got ta get off the hills and you got ta get out and charge forward , " @entity131 said on " @entity113			0
" " certainly , in part , this is a referendum on this president , there 's no doubt about it			0
but i think for most @entity67 -- particularly in my state , where there 's an awful lot of swing , independent voters -- they want to know more than what 's wrong with this president			0
they want to know what 's right and what 's going to move this country forward			0
i think @entity10 's got this plan			2
i want to see fire in the belly			0
" @entity161 chairman @entity160 dismissed the handwringing among some @entity9 about the state of the campaign and insisted @entity10 had a good week , despite an intense focus in the media on the " 47 % " comments , which were secretly recorded at a fund - raiser in @entity33 months ago			1
priebus on @entity10 : ' not the best week ' " we had a good week last week , i think in retrospect , in that we were able to frame up the debate last week in the sense of , what future do we want , and do you want , out there for your kids and grandkids			2
and clearly , things are not going well in this country , " @entity160 said on " @entity64			0
" @entity160 ' comments echoed ones @entity10 made in a " @entity187 " interview set to air sunday night , in which he said his campaign did not need a turnaround			2
" actually , we 're tied in the polls			0
we 're all within the margin of error , " @entity10 told @entity190 's @entity189 , in excerpts released ahead of showtime			2
" we bounce around , week to week , day to day			0
there are some days we 're up			0
there are some days we 're down			0
" @entity23 campaign officials say it is not the national polls but the swing state polls that matter			1
" we 're either tied or in the lead in every battleground state 45 days out , " campaign manager @entity201 told reporters in @entity203 on saturday			2
" i think you will see a tightening in the national polls going forward			1
what i care way more about is @entity34 , @entity41 , @entity35 , @entity36 , etc. in those states , i feel our pathways to victory are there			0
there are two different campaigns , one in the battlegrounds and one everywhere else			0
that 's why the national polls are n't relevant to this campaign			1
" @entity10 plans to spend part of the last full week before the october 3 debate on a bus tour in @entity34 , while the president is scheduled to speak at the @entity223 on tuesday , before making campaign stops in @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity10 rebuts conservative criticism of his campaign trajectory			2
