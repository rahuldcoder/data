@entity0 -- when @entity3 and @entity4 came up with their romantic little idea , it seemed perfect			1
they would get married in early october on the rim of the @entity9 , just as the cooling winds of autumn were starting to blow			2
with family and friends standing by , they would pledge their love to each other			2
cue the rainbow , and the cry of the circling eagle			2
then their uncle showed up			2
and everything went to hell			2
" well , i 've been going through a lot of emotions , " @entity3 said after the government shutdown put the canyon off limits , and their plans on ice			1
i had to make all new plans			2
" she is not alone			2
about two dozen couples planned to tie the knot in @entity35 over the next few days , and now they ca n't even pitch a pup tent			1
" we 've been joking , " @entity3 says , " that the government is going to put a tarp over ( the canyon ) so we ca n't see it			1
" party politics fuel shutdown blame game stubborn @entity42 or dogmatic @entity43 listen to @entity43 , and the government shutdown is a tale of recklessly stubborn republicans driving the country into a chasm			1
listen to @entity42 , and it 's a story of cleverly dogmatic @entity43 who would rather see calamity than make a deal			2
but listen to many voters and you 'll hear a question : how is it possible that both parties have failed so badly in the relatively simple task of keeping the federal government open for business ? " if i do n't perform at my job , then i do n't get paid , " @entity4 , the canyon - stranded groom says			1
" that should hold true for other people			2
" it is simple to measure the impact of the shutdown in numbers : more than 843,000 employees may be told to pack up their staplers and go home until they are called back ; a billion dollars a week could be falling out of the economy as a result of the cut in federal spending			1
business lost , research halted : impacts of the shutdown an emotional rollercoaster it is also easy to understand why furloughed federal workers are angry			1
after all , one of the perks of government employment has traditionally been stability			1
along the @entity87 , a woman leaving her government office for what , at the moment , is an undetermined period of time looked disgusted			1
" we 've been on an emotional rollercoaster for a while			0
" defense worker @entity97 has already taken a hit to his income this year from the forced budget cuts , and he is struggling with unexpected medical bills			0
while he waits to see how long and severe the shutdown is , he fears for his family of six			1
" if we were to go into a moderate government shutdown , i 'd probably have to file for bankruptcy			1
" " federal workers have nothing to do with bringing about the government shutdown , " says @entity106			1
he 's the head of the @entity110 and adds , " but they are the ones who are going to feel the impact of it the greatest			0
" but frustration is echoing among many other @entity116 , too ; from cities , to the countryside , to the valleys of all those empty national parks			0
ridiculous closures part of it is the sheer ridiculousness of what has been caught in the financial and political vise			0
at the @entity129 , there will be no more " panda cam " for those keeping track of those little black and white balls of fur			0
also , in case you 're counting , no tiger , orangutan , or clawed otter cams			0
in orbit , @entity116 astronauts will apparently be just fine on the @entity141 , but we wo n't be able to spy on them through @entity143			1
it also appeared for a while that no one would be watching for asteroids hurtling toward the earth , then the space agency tweeted " to clarify : many observatories ... are watching the sky			0
" that did not stop the galactic snarkiness from @entity153 , who tweeted right back , " but we 're all still gon na die , right ? " and on the football field , @entity154 may not play @entity156 this weekend as scheduled			0
apparently the cost of travel is an issue , although perhaps they no longer have a coin to toss for the kickoff either			0
@entity163 learned hard lesson in failed @entity166 coup blocking vets within a short walk of both the @entity170 and the @entity166 , one scene captivated what is clearly maddening about the situation for all sorts of people			0
a group of veterans from @entity177 , many in wheelchairs , came to @entity0 to see the @entity180 , only to find the open - air site fenced off			1
after some consternation , the fences were pushed aside			0
a bagpiper played , the vets went in , and guards just looked on while members of @entity188 on hand railed about the stupidity of the whole scene			0
@entity43 senator @entity192 from @entity193 : " i do n't get it			0
" @entity42 rep. @entity195 from @entity196 : " we 've got park service employees out here			1
why would n't you have them here to allow the veterans in , instead of stand and keep them from coming in ? " shutdown : @entity203 blames @entity42 ' ideological crusade ' who 's at fault ? to be sure , there is enough blame out there to choke a horse			1
polls show the @entity42 taking the worst of it , but democrats and president @entity203 are also being hammered for their part in the debacle			0
by late afternoon , the growing tide of unrest seemed to be having some effect			0
@entity42 congressman @entity220 from @entity221 , while still opposing @entity222 , was telling @entity1 's @entity223 he 'd like to see a deal to make it all stop			0
" now we 're at a point ... what are we fighting for ? i do n't think the continued shutdown helps our conservative agenda			1
" indeed , few are arguing that this leap into the economic abyss will help anyone , except voters who might yet want more reasons to think badly of the whole @entity0 crowd .			0

the government shutdown is already having real - world consequences
engaged couples to federal employees are feeling the brunt
even @entity143 has had its capabilities limited by the shutdown
