at a factory about an hour west of @entity27 's capital @entity0 , @entity28 , one of @entity23 's biggest manufacturing partners			1

it 's an oppressive culture that labor groups say contributed to a slew of suicides in 2010 at the company 's @entity61 plant -- prompting @entity28 to install nets in an effort to prevent employees from jumping			1
as a poor college student with no work experience , looking for job in @entity1 's competitive market is an uphill battle			2
so when @entity9 was offered a one - month position at @entity28 during the @entity73 -- with promises of great benefits and little overtime , she jumped at the chance			2
