@entity0 -- as the seven - week - long parade that was the trial of @entity0 mob boss @entity2 passed by , jurors , courtroom spectators and the public watched and listened as former bookies , former drug dealers , extortion victims , gangsters , convicted killers , families of murder victims , and former @entity15 agents made their appearances			1
everyone in that parade had one thing in common : their lives were forever altered by the 83 - year - old man who now sat day after day after day at the defense table			0
in courtroom give - and - take , there was profanity , there was violence echoing in the testimony of some witnesses as they described killings in gruesome detail , there was pain etched into the court record by the words of relatives as they remembered loved ones lost to @entity2 's wrath			1
in the end , the jury came back with a guilty verdict on 31 of 32 counts against @entity2 , including involvement in 11 murders , extortion , money laundering and weapons possession			1
but for those who became part of the @entity2 parade -- and who still walk through their days with its many impacts -- the verdict was n't really the end			1
@entity2 linked to 11 murders " i said ' rat - tat - tat - tat ' as @entity2 was being led out of the court room , because it was reference to the comment he had ... about killing my father , " @entity56 said after court monday			1
the jury found that @entity2 was involved in killing " @entity64 , a @entity65 bartender who was lured to a phone booth in 1975 and murdered with a machine gun			1
@entity2 was the shooter , according to witness testimony			1
during the trial the jury heard a recorded conversation with @entity2 describing the murder of @entity64 and imitating the sound of a machine gun			1
" @entity78 ... the guy in the phone booth ... pa - pa - pa - pa pow , " @entity2 said in the recorded chat with relatives			2
so @entity56 made her own machine - gun sounds monday			0
" i yelled that as he was going out , knowing that he would know what i was talking about , " she said			0
that recorded phone conversation was one of the few moments the jury heard @entity2 's voice , except for a few expletives he let loose from time to time to describe witnesses or testimony not to his liking			1
in the early days of the trial , it was like a meeting of old friends , @entity2 listening carefully -- laughing heartily at one point -- to colorful recollections of former @entity0 bookie @entity100 , who ran a successful bookmaking operation that he inherited from his father			1
@entity2 guilty in killings , racketeering but this was no remember - when reunion between two elderly men			2
the 84 - year - old @entity100 , who lives in @entity108 and uses a wheel chair , described a meeting between @entity2 and a man who owed him money			2
when the man balked at paying , @entity2 replied , " we have a business besides bookmaking			2
" " what 's that ? " the man asked			0
" killing ( expletive ) like you			0
" @entity2 , who had shown little emotion up during the trial until then , threw his head back and let out a laugh			1
hitman , convicted killer , and former partner @entity124 also took the stand and implicated @entity2 in 13 murders			1
@entity124 alluded to @entity2 as " @entity129 , " a term that he described as " a person like an informant , a rat , a no - good guy			2
i was brought up that that was the worst thing in the world			0
" although @entity2 's lawyers tried to highlight inconsistencies in @entity124 's testimony , he did n't waiver , declaring he had n't lied to prosecutors since cutting a deal that guaranteed his testimony in exchange for a 14 - year sentence			1
@entity124 admitted to over 20 murders and served just 12 years on good behavior before becoming a free man in 2007			0
prosecutors revealed a 700 - page file that showed @entity2 was on the @entity15 books as an informant for nearly 20 years , at the same time he was committing acts of murder , extortion , and money - laundering			2
in a trial that exposed deep - seated corruption in the @entity15 and government during @entity2 's heyday , jurors heard from a disgraced @entity15 supervisor who admitted to tipping off @entity2 's rogue informant handler that one of @entity2 's associates had turned and had become an informant			1
disgraced @entity168 apologized in court to the family of @entity171 , one of the victims determined by the jury to have died when he was caught in the crossfire of an attempted hit on another man			2
@entity168 said he was sorry for leaking sensitive information that eventually made its way to the reputed @entity0 crime boss and cost @entity171 his life			0
" i do n't ask for your forgiveness , but i do want to express my sincere apology for things i may have done and things i did n't do , " @entity168 said to the @entity171 family			0
@entity171 's three sons and widow , @entity189 , sat front row in the reserved section in the @entity0 courtroom			0
@entity2 uttered under his breath " you 're a f --- ing liar , " as @entity168 , who admitted to accepting thousands of dollars in payoffs , testified that there was " no question " the @entity197 gangster doubled as an informant for @entity15 in @entity0			0
that was not the only time expletives flew in federal court			0
@entity2 's former mob enforcer , @entity205 , described as a " surrogate son , " to @entity2 , said in court " we killed people that were rats , and i had the two biggest rats right next to me ... " at that , @entity2 turned and hissed , " you suck			1
" " f --- you , ok , " snapped weeks from the witness stand			0
" f --- you , too , " shouted @entity2 from his chair at the defense table as the jury watched and listened			1
" what do you want to do ? " said @entity205 , his eyes locked on @entity2 , who was flushed and staring right back			0
weeks testified he was there the night @entity224 was killed			0
he placed the murder weapon squarely in @entity2 's hands			1
" @entity2 just kept shooting , " said @entity222 describing @entity224 's writhing , bullet - ridden body as " bouncing off the ground			2
" @entity2 was convicted in connection with @entity224 's death			2
prosecutors offered up extortion victim after extortion victim to show @entity2 conspired to collect " rent " from operating criminals in @entity0			0
@entity237 barely survived a life - or - death @entity240 - roulette - style drama after @entity2 tried to extort $ 1 million			0
according to @entity237 , @entity2 ordered one of his associates to shoot past @entity237 's head with a gun equipped with a silencer -- proving the gun worked -- before ordering his associate to reload the weapon with a single bullet			2
" a bullet was put in the chamber , it was spun and pointed at my head , " said @entity237			0
" the trigger was pulled and it did n't go off			0
" prosecutors wrapped up 30 days of testimony by placing 30 guns and nearly $ 822,000 in cash on a table -- items seized from @entity2 's @entity262 , @entity263 , apartment when he was arrested in 2011 after spending 16 years as a fugitive			1
@entity2 's defense wrapped its case with witnesses in five days , calling former @entity15 agents whotestified to the corrupt nature of @entity0 @entity15 in the ' 70s and ' 80s			1
the defense put 20 photos on the public docket unveiling @entity2 's softer side , leading people to speculate that the gangster might testify			1
in the end , he did not			0
" my thing is ... i did n't get a fair trial			0
do what ya 's want with me , " the defendant told the judge before the case went to the jury			1
his voice shaking , @entity2 insisted he had a deal with the late @entity289 , head of the @entity292 's @entity291 @entity290 who later became @entity295 attorney in @entity0 during the height of @entity2 's alleged gangland reign			1
" in return , he promised to give me immunity			0
as far as i 'm concerned i did n't get a fair trial , " @entity2 said			2
@entity1 's @entity302 and @entity303 reported from @entity0 , and @entity304 wrote from @entity305 .			0

the trial was a parade of witnesses , characters , victims
memories were relived , murders were recalled
in the end , the jury *believed* the *stream* of testimony , evidence against @entity2
in the end , @entity2 's *assessment* : " this is a sham . do what ya 's want with me "
