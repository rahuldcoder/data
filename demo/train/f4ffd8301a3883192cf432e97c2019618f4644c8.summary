-- @entity1 without music ? that 's like @entity4 without canals -- and just as hard to imagine			1
music weaves @entity1 ' past with its present , and the infinite jazz variations -- from the ethereal warble of classic dixieland to the tuba - powered street funk of brass bands -- serve as a soundtrack to this storied city			1

@entity1 music sounds sweeter today , and here 's why : in the wake of @entity21 , few were certain the streets would resound as they once did			2
it 's not that clubs flooded and venues were wiped out -- many were on high ground and survived just fine -- but the rising waters took out much of the city 's affordable housing and its tourism industry			2
that uncertain future made it unclear whether pass - the - hat musicians and hardworking club regulars would be able to regain their footing in the city			1
but several groups took the lead to ensure that musicians would still have a home in @entity1			2
locally revered nightclub @entity44 's earmarks its proceeds to help musicians return to town and to put musical instruments back into the flooded schools			1
@entity50 and @entity51 , two @entity1 natives , partnered with @entity53 to build the @entity54 in the @entity55			0
today , this cluster of colorful shotgun - style cottages , located an easy bike ride from the @entity60 , is gradually being filled by musicians ( and others ) as volunteers continue to travel here to build the houses			1
@entity66 : beyond @entity67 while some still debate whether the music scene has fully regained its pre-storm luster , there 's no denying that anyone who shows up hungry for the famous @entity1 sound will leave sated			2
you can still stroll the @entity60 or nearby @entity74 and pass dozens of clubs where languid notes wander out into the muffled , humid air , pause for a moment , and disappear into the night			0

here are four not to miss. @entity83 has the feel of a speakeasy -- you enter through a low - ceilinged bar into an open performance space that 's at once intimate and grand			1
with live music nightly , this is a good spot for classic , straight - ahead jazz			1
expect talents such as @entity93 ( father of @entity51 and @entity95 ) , @entity96 ( a member of @entity1 ' first family of music ) , and powerhouse trumpet player @entity100 with his @entity102			0
@entity66 : @entity103 three decades ago , a handful of local musicians was dismayed that piano legend professor @entity106 had no place to showcase his talents			1
they acquired a bar @entity110 ( it 's about a 10 - minute cab ride from the @entity60 ) , and renamed the venue after the @entity106 's signature song			1
today @entity44 's , a spacious , two - level club in a boxy yellow building marked by a @entity118 beer sign , attracts local and touring musicians ranging from inimitable songwriter - composer @entity120 to rising stars such as @entity122			1
seating is nonexistent -- assume you 'll be standing the whole show -- but the open space works to your advantage on sunday evenings , when @entity129 's hosts a @entity131 dance party , with the emphasis on dance			2
for the gold standard of @entity1 performance venues , visit @entity136			0
carved out of a 1750 @entity139 residence in the heart of the @entity60 , it 's had the self - appointed mission of preserving local music since 1961			1
the audience lines up on the sidewalk , crowds in ( it 's one of the few places in town to enjoy music without smoke ) , then taps their feet along with bands schooled in the old ways of @entity1			2
great local musicians perform regularly , all linked by their devotion to traditional music			1
thursdays are typically brass - band nights , where the " big " gets put in " big @entity1 sound			2
when people imagine a laid - back @entity1 jazz club , they 're thinking of a place like @entity168 's @entity167			1
smoky and utterly un-self - conscious , the corner bar sits on a fringe of the @entity60 where few tourists happen by			0
inside , it 's too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter			0
black - and - white photos of venerable @entity1 bands hang unevenly on the walls			0
but the music ! it showcases a revolving cast of local greats , with monday gigs by @entity183 and vocalist @entity184 , and rollicking appearances by barrelhouse piano player @entity186			1
arrive before the show to get one of the handful of seats at the bar or in front of the low stage , grab a cold beer , then let the music take you away			0
it 's not too early to plan a trip to @entity1 for the @entity199 , featuring more than 150 musical performances on 18 stages			0
the event runs april 17 - 19 , 2009			0
