get dialing for your reservation now : @entity2 in @entity3 has been named the world 's best restaurant at a ceremony revealing the planet 's top 50 dining venues			1
to raucous cheers , high fives , hugs and kisses , team @entity2 took to the stage in a packed @entity15 venue in jubilant scenes that would n't be out of place at the @entity18 in @entity19 later this year			1
@entity2 's top honor in the prestigious @entity22 's @entity21 -- viewed as the @entity23 of fine dining -- was the fourth win for minimalist @entity27 pioneer of foraged menus			1
the award was presented late monday at a ceremony in central @entity15 attended by some of the world 's leading chefs			2
" it 's too ( expletive deleted ) crazy ! " said @entity2 's head chef , @entity34 , picking up the award			1
" thank you for believing in us			2
" in the last year ( after the restaurant was awarded second place ) my staff and i looked into each others ' eyes and said ' let 's just really really work hard			1
' we made a plan and said ' let 's make this the best year we 've ever had			1
' " " but to have this is a whole surprise , none of us expected it			2
" the list , now in its 12th year , is dominated by @entity54 venues , but there were prizes for restaurants from around the world , including @entity60 's first top 20 entry			1
the biggest climber was @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , which jumped from no. 50 last year to no. 15 this year			2
the highest debut entry was @entity66 from @entity67 , which came in at no. 17			0
highly influential there were few changes in the list 's top 10			1
last year 's winner , @entity74 's @entity72 , was bumped to second place , with @entity77 's @entity76 holding steady at number three			1
despite the repeat victory for @entity2 , it 's still yet to match the record of @entity74 's @entity82 , which claimed four successive wins before head chef @entity84 closed its doors in 2011			1
other winners in the top 10 were , in fourth place @entity90 's @entity89 , followed by @entity74 's @entity91 , @entity19 's @entity92 , @entity15 's dinner by @entity94 , @entity74 's @entity95 , @entity97 's @entity96 and @entity98 , another @entity15 restaurant			1
@entity2 , which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year , was praised for its " fresh approach and energy			1
" the restaurant 's menu serves diners with a series of " snacks " largely sourced from the @entity108 landscape -- dishes that include sea urchin toast and a beef tartar that includes ants			2
most of the winners -- a total of 28 -- were from @entity54 , with @entity74 claiming seven top 50 positions			1
@entity117 , a @entity119 restaurant in @entity67 that earlier this year was named @entity60 's best , made it to number 13 in the list -- the region 's highest entry			1
organized by @entity125 - based @entity124 and sponsored by @entity77 drinks manufacturers @entity126 and @entity127 , the awards are seen as highly influential in the fine dining industry			1
@entity2 's first win in 2010 is credited with catapulting the restaurant to international stardom			1
reputedly , the day after winning , it received enough online reservations to fill its 45 seats for a decade -- thankfully , it only takes bookings for a few weeks in advance			0
some observers say the awards now hold greater sway over a restaurant 's financial success and bookings than coveted @entity143 star rankings , often transforming them into major travel destinations			1
' beauty contest ' " this is the big one , " contest chairman @entity146 told @entity147 ahead of the awards			2
" although you can argue about the list , everyone wants to be on it			0
" @entity146 said the list is n't a rival to @entity143 's " systematic " assessments , describing it as a spontaneous " beauty contest for restaurants			1
" the list was decided by votes compiled from 900 restaurant industry figures			2
the winning names were closely guarded ahead of this year 's ceremony after details were leaked prior to announcement in 2013			1
@entity125 chef @entity164 received a lifetime achievement award at this year 's event			1
@entity164 's @entity168 restaurant in @entity15 has championed " nose - to - tail " eating that utilizes every part of an animal			2
