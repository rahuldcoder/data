@entity0 -- the @entity2 on wednesday lifted sanctions placed on the @entity4 over its underwater sonar testing , a setback for environmental groups that claimed the warfare technology was harming whales and other marine mammals			1
an endangered blue whale surfaces off the coast of @entity13 in july			0
at issue in the 5 - 4 ruling was whether the @entity4 's need to conduct exercises to protect the country from enemy submarines outweighed concerns raised by environmental groups			1
the case focused on whether the president had the power to issue executive waivers allowing such tests and whether federal judges can issue preliminary injunctions blocking them			0
the high court ultimately sided with claims of national security over environmental concerns			0
those environmental interests , said chief justice @entity34 for the majority , " are plainly outweighed by the @entity4 's need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines			1
" @entity34 said a lower federal court " abused its discretion " by imposing a 2,200 - yard perimeter for testing and ordering a shutdown of sonar use during surfacing exercises			2
but in dissent , justice @entity48 warned that the ecological damage was significant			0
" this likely harm can not be lightly dismissed , " she said , " even in the face of an alleged risk to the effectiveness of the @entity4 's 14 training exercises			1
" justices @entity56 , @entity58 and @entity59 also questioned the @entity4 's arguments			1
the exercises have continued while the case was under appeal			0
environmentalists had sued the @entity65 over the practice , and a federal judge ordered major changes to the @entity4 's annual offshore training exercises in march			1
president @entity70 had issued an emergency waiver to allow the exercises to go on without the filing of an environmental impact study , but the lower court ruling blocked the use of sonar			0
that federal judge , in ruling against the government last march , said it was " constitutionally suspect " for @entity70 to issue the national security exemption to allow skipping the impact study			0
military officials argued that the restrictions could hamper readiness in time of war , because new sonar technology is needed to detect increasingly sophisticated enemy submarines			0
" this case was vital to our @entity4 and nation 's security , and we are pleased with the @entity2 's decision in this matter , " navy secretary @entity88 said			1
" we can now continue to train our sailors effectively , under realistic combat conditions			1
" one of the environmental organizations that sued the @entity65 told the justices that the exercises had been planned in advance and that the @entity4 was required under law to conduct more extensive environmental tests than it had			2
the waters of southern @entity13 are home to dozens of species of whales , dolphins , seals and sea lions , nine of them federally listed as endangered or threatened			0
federal courts have cited scientific studies and the @entity4 's own conclusions that high levels of sonar can cause hearing loss and disorientation in the animals			2
in february , the @entity4 demonstrated for @entity1 its onboard procedures for turning down mid-frequency sonar when whales come within 1,000 meters and shutting it off completely when they approach 200 meters			2
the sonar sounds like a " ping , ping " noise , and it can be reduced as necessary , officers said			0
but environmentalists say that the sonar can hurt whales much farther than 1,000 meters away and that the noise created by the sonar " was like having a jet engine in the @entity2 multiplied 2,000 times , compensating for water , " attorney @entity129 told the justices			1
reacting to the ruling , @entity129 said , " it is gratifying that the court did not accept the @entity4 's expansive claims of executive power and that two - thirds of the injunction remain in place			1
" in 2000 , 16 whales beached themselves in the @entity146 , and the @entity4 concluded that too many sonar ships had been operating in a narrow underwater channel			2
the service says it is funding $ 16 million in independent research to minimize sonar 's effect on marine mammals .			0

new : navy secretary says ruling allows sailors to train under " realistic " conditions
by 5 - 4 vote , @entity2 allows @entity4 exercises in whale *habitat*
sound waves can *permanently* harm sea mammals , environmentalists argue
@entity170 's *safety* and need to train trump concern for whales , chief justice writes
