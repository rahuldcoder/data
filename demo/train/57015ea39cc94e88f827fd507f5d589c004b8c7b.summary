-- the magnitude - 8.8 earthquake that rocked the west coast of @entity4 last month was violent enough to move the city of @entity6 at least 10 feet to the west and the capital , @entity9 , about 11 inches to the west - southwest , researchers said			2
the quake also shifted other parts of @entity12 , as far apart as the @entity13 and @entity14 , @entity15			1
the results were reached via global positioning satellite measurements taken before and after the february 27 quake by teams from the @entity20 , the @entity21 , the @entity22 and the @entity23 , as well as agencies across @entity12			1
@entity26 scientists have also credited the quake with shifting the @entity29 's axis enough to create shorter days			1
the change is negligible , but still worth noting : each day should be 1.26 microseconds shorter , according to preliminary calculations			0
a microsecond is one - millionth of a second			0
a large quake -- like the one that hit @entity4 's @entity36 -- shifts massive amounts of rock and alters the distribution of mass on the planet			2
when that distribution changes , it changes the rate at which the planet rotates			0
and the rotation rate determines the length of a day			0
" any worldly event that involves the movement of mass affects the @entity29 's rotation , " @entity48 , of @entity26 's @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , said while explaining the phenomenon in 2005			1
despite the tragedy of the earthquake , which killed hundreds of @entity4 , scientists see opportunities to gain valuable information in the aftermath			1
" the @entity36 earthquake will arguably become one of the , if not the most important , great earthquakes yet studied , " said @entity63 of the @entity64 at the @entity21			0
" we now have modern , precise instruments to evaluate this event			0

@entity72 also shifted other parts of @entity12
scientists have credited the quake with shifting the @entity29 's axis
despite deaths , *experts* see opportunities to gain valuable information in the aftermath
