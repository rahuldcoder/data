-- talk about rubbing it in			0
as if @entity5 fans needed reminding of last season 's traumatic collapse with a long - awaited @entity10 title in sight , the club 's hangover was made very apparent saturday			1
a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity13 was the third in five matches for @entity16 ' team , coming after a last - gasp midweek win at home to @entity20 underdog @entity19 in the @entity21			1
on friday , @entity13 manager @entity22 -- who narrowly avoided the sack last season after his side 's slightly flattering 13th placing -- chided the @entity27 for having failed to break the recent dominance of the @entity30 clubs and @entity31			1
" they were in pole position and had one hand on the trophy but they ended up throwing it away , " he wrote in his newspaper column			0
" they had no @entity43 football to distract them , their schedule was clear except for that one goal , that one focus			0
they were brilliant but they should have taken full advantage when they had it in the palm of their hands			0
" if @entity22 -- once tipped as a future @entity56 manager but often derided for his functional long - ball tactics -- was attempting mind games then you could argue that it paid off			2
his team went 2 - 0 up inside seven minutes against a new - look @entity5 side still getting to grips with the departure of top scorer , game - changer and all - round mischief - maker @entity67 to @entity68			1
@entity70 international defender @entity69 scored the opener from close range -- his first goal since october 2013 -- and new signing @entity75 netted his third in as many games with a speculative chip from the right			2
@entity5 pulled one back before halftime through @entity56 forward @entity81 after @entity83 's shot was blocked , but the @entity85 striker made few other telling contributions apart from a booking when he clashed with goalkeeper @entity88			1
@entity13 sealed victory in the 88th minute when @entity90 set up substitute @entity91 , with @entity5 pressing for the equalizer			1
the win lifted the @entity94 to eighth place , leaving last season 's runner - up @entity5 languishing in 10th -- six points behind leader @entity31 , which travels to champion @entity100 on sunday			1
" it 's a well - deserved victory -- it 's not a lucky one , it 's not @entity5 having an off day , it 's @entity13 being absolutely brilliant on the day , " @entity22 told @entity104 broadcaster @entity102			1
" i thought the first - half performance was absolutely outstanding -- in actual fact , i thought we should have been three or four up by halftime			0
" it was the first time since december that @entity5 had lost successive league games , following last weekend 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity114			1
" we were nowhere near the standard today , " said @entity16 , whose team face a midweek @entity117 game against @entity118 before next saturday 's @entity120 derby against @entity121			0
" it is just not quite happening for us at the moment			0
we have a lot of work to do and today was very disappointing in terms of performance			0
" @entity114 had gone into the weekend in second place but fell back to earth with a bump , losing 3 - 0 to an @entity133 team smarting from a midweek @entity21 defeat away to @entity135			1
with new signing @entity138 rested by @entity140 , @entity137 winner @entity136 was given the chance to shine in a more central role -- and the @entity143 duly delivered with the opening goal just after half an hour and an assist for new signing @entity146			2
an own - goal from @entity149 made it three in the space of seven minutes , and the game was effectively over before halftime as @entity133 moved up to fourth			1
" you have to show him the confidence is there and he showed he can respond when he was under scrutiny , " @entity140 said of @entity136 , who has been strongly criticized for luckluster displays this season and in the second half of the previous one			2
" it 's always a sensitive point , you do n't know how people respond to that			0
" @entity114 boss @entity168 lamented the virus that had decimated his squad before the game			2
" it 's a tough game for us when everyone is 100 % fit , but the lads were running on empty , " said the @entity172 , who has been rewarded with a new contract until 2018			0
at the other end of the managerial security spectrum , @entity179 's @entity178 can thank substitute @entity182 for giving him a lifeline			0
the @entity185 striker , making his return after fracturing a kneecap in march , scored twice in the last 20 minutes to deny @entity188 in a 2 - 2 draw -- though @entity179 remained in the bottom three			2
@entity191 moved up to second place , above @entity114 on goal difference , with a 1 - 0 win at @entity195 thanks to an 80th - minute goal from sub @entity197 -- the @entity199 midfielder 's first for the club			1
@entity201 salvaged a 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity204 thanks to a late free - kick from @entity207 veteran @entity206 , while @entity208 drew 0 - 0 at promoted @entity209 .			0

@entity5 beaten for second successive match , losing 3 - 1 at @entity13
last season 's @entity10 runner - up in 10th place after five games
