it was an epic battle			0
@entity10 goalie @entity9 on one hand			1
the entire @entity13 team on the other			0

the @entity21 lost the match 2 - 1 and is out of the tourney , but the nation gained a soccer hero			2
here 's what you need to know about the 35 - year - old @entity9 : he 's a devout @entity30 faith is a key part of @entity9 's life and shapes who he is			1
" the most important thing in my life is @entity40 , " @entity9 said in a 2006 interview with @entity37			1
" he 's more important to me than winning or losing or whether i 'm playing or not			2
everything else is just a bonus			0
" he was born in @entity44 , @entity45 , to an @entity47 father and a @entity49 mother			1
he is all tatted up @entity9 loves his body art. you want ink , you got it -- chest , abs , biceps , back			1
his kids are there on his left pec			0
@entity59 is on the left biceps			0
you 'll find his home state of @entity45 on his belly			1
there 's a dove , too			2
the more you look , the more you find			0
he is anti-fur @entity9 bared his well - sculpted upper body for @entity71 's " ink , not mink " campaign			1
the pitch ? " fur only looks good on its original owner			0
be comfortable in your own skin , and let animals keep theirs			0
" he lives with @entity80 's syndrome for @entity9 , it 's not a big deal -- just part of his life			1
but it does come with some misconceptions			0
" it 's something that i live with every day			2
for me now in my life , it 's like breathing for me			2
if i woke up and did n't have @entity80 's syndrome , it would feel weird -- not better or worse , just different			2
so i 'm very happy and comfortable with it , " he said			0
many know it only as the " swearing disease , " but only about 10 % of people with @entity80 's syndrome swear uncontrollably			2
" you know , we do n't all curse , " @entity9 told @entity96 a couple of weeks ago			1
" i do on the field , unfortunately , to get my point across , but it 's not because of my condition			2
" people with @entity80 's syndrome suffer from involuntary tics , which can be either verbal or physical			2
physical tics may include jumping or twitching			0
people with the syndrome describe a tic as being like a sneeze , impossible to hold in without extreme discomfort			0
@entity110 surrenders to @entity80 's syndrome he once scored a goal how many goalkeepers can claim this feat ? while playing for @entity114 , his @entity115 team , @entity9 booted a ball the length of the pitch , catching the @entity120 goalie by surprise			1
the crowd and his teammates went nuts , but @entity9 told @entity124 he felt bad for the opposing keeper			1
" you never want to see that happen , " he said			0
" it 's not nice , it 's embarrassing			2
" he was n't really that good when he started out when @entity9 began his pro career as a 22 - year - old goalkeeper for the @entity133 / @entity132 of @entity134 , he was known as a great athlete who could make great saves			1
some reports have even said he could have played basketball in college			0
but the 6 - foot - 3 @entity9 was n't particularly good at other things , like distributing the ball after he made a nice stop			1
it 's something he is much , much better at today			2
in 2001 he was @entity134 goalkeeper of the year			2
and @entity145 , one of the most successful @entity148 clubs in history , worked out a transfer deal for him			0
@entity9 spent four years with @entity145 before transferring to @entity114			1
he is the ' modern jesus ' even before the game ended tuesday , @entity9 's incredible saves got @entity110 in a tizzy			1
sample tweet : " @entity59 saves , and so does @entity9			1
" then came the memes of all the things # @entity159 : dinosaurs , the @entity160 , @entity161 from closing			0
he is the ' @entity21 secretary of defense ' well , at least he was for a little while on tuesday , according to @entity164			0
so impressive was his performance against the @entity13 that someone edited the free on - line encyclopedia , pulling @entity168 from the page and inserting @entity9			1
the folks at @entity164 caught the vandalism and restored the real secretary of defense to his rightful position			0
someone thinks with a little mentoring @entity9 might be able to make that @entity164 change again one day down the road			1
at least that 's what the @entity178 says @entity180 told @entity9 when he called him on wednesday			1
@entity180 phoned the goalkeeper to " thank him for defending the @entity21 at the @entity20 , " @entity178 press secretary rear adm. @entity182 said			1
@entity180 also invited the team to drop by the @entity178 next time they are in town			0

and , if there were any doubters , he silenced them all on tuesday			0
he is coming back in 2018 ( or is he ? ) this may not be @entity9 's final @entity20			1
plenty of goalies have played in their late 30s and early 40s			0
but backup @entity212 , who plays at @entity213 in @entity214 , is five years younger			0
@entity9 has yet to say whether he wants to be in the net when the team tries to qualify for @entity217 , host of the 2018 @entity20			1
and he was n't giving any clues on wednesday when he talked with @entity0 's @entity220			2
" right now , emotions are high and that 's never a time to make an important decision , " @entity9 said			1
" i 'll speak to the important people who matter in this process and take my time and figure it out			0
