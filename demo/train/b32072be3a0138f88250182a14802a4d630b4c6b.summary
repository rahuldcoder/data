-- @entity1 was n't eager to disclose details of his health issues over the years			1
that the @entity5 co-founder contracted a rare form of pancreatic cancer in 2003 was n't disclosed until after his return from surgery more than nine months later			1
another health problem , which was innocuously described at first as a " hormone imbalance , " turned into a six - month leave during which @entity1 underwent a liver transplant			1
yet @entity1 ' views on existence , as he increasingly faced his own mortality , became ever more poetic and less concealed toward the end			1
these could be seen in the rare interviews he 'd grant but also in e-mail correspondences with acquaintances and strangers , which he often took the time to partake in			2
" i do n't think of my life as a career , " he told @entity28 in 2010			1
that 's not a career -- it 's a life ! " @entity1 also shared his condolences and personal revelations with others facing similar pressures			1
a man named @entity40 told the news site @entity42 that he e-mailed @entity1 on april 20 , 2010 , to thank him for supporting an organ donor program			1
@entity40 mentioned that his girlfriend had died of melanoma two years before			2
@entity1 replied : " your [ sic ] most welcome , @entity40			1
i 'm sorry about your girlfriend			0
" the rare moments when @entity1 publicly waxed philosophical were among his most memorable			1
perhaps the most widely quoted is his 2005 commencement address to @entity52 's graduating class : " remembering that i 'll be dead soon is the most important tool i 've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life			2
because almost everything -- all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important , " he said			1
" remembering that you are going to die is the best way i know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose			0
there is no reason not to follow your heart			0
" he continued : " no one wants to die			0
even people who want to go to heaven do n't want to die to get there			2
and yet death is the destination we all share			2
no one has ever escaped it			0
and that is as it should be , because death is very likely the single best invention of life			1
it is life 's change agent			2
" people often looked to @entity1 for advice on dealing with the inevitable , and he seemed eager to offer his guidance			1
one of the first calls @entity94 , a former sales chief for the failed computer company @entity1 founded called @entity96 , made after getting diagnosed with cancer was to @entity1			1
( they shared the same oncologist and radiologist			0
) the pair kept in touch , @entity94 recalled to the @entity103 , and @entity94 received an exuberant e-mail from @entity1 after telling him the news that @entity94 's surgery was successful			1
@entity94 told the @entity103 : " messages from him were generally laconic			0
this one had 20 exclamation points			0
i have a cousin who 's a pretty well regarded cancer research doctor and told him the doctor @entity112 referred me to ; he said , ' do n't even ask for a second opinion			2
' " even in 1995 , @entity1 seemed undeterred in the face of death			1
he said in an interview with the @entity119 : " we 're all going to be dead soon ; that 's my point of view			0
somebody once told me , they said , ' live each day as if it would be your last , and @entity128 day you 'll certainly be right			0
you never know when you 're going to go , butÂ you are going to go pretty soon			0
if you 're going to leave anything behind , it 's going toÂ be your kids , a few friends and your work			0
so that 's what i tend to worry about			0
" @entity1 set out to " put a dent in the universe , " as he would say , and many believe he did just that			1
he transformed industries , improved important tools and changed the daily lives for billions of people			0
but as much as the world may have needed a visionary like @entity1 , he apparently needed us , too			1
" you know , there 's nothing that makes my day more than getting an e-mail from some random person in the universe who just bought an @entity157 over in the @entity158 and tells me the story about how it 's the coolest product they 've ever brought home , you know , in their lives , " @entity1 said at the @entity150 conference in 2010			2
" that 's what keeps me going			0
and it 's what kept me going five years ago			0
it 's what kept me going 10 years ago , when the doors were almost closed			0
and it 's what 'll keep me going five years from now , whatever happens , " he said			0
@entity1 died 16 months later to a public outpouring of grief .			2

@entity1 was n't always *forthcoming* about his health issues
near the end , he began to speak more openly about death in e-mails
@entity5 co-founder said throughout his life that he did not fear death
