-- @entity2 's recent filing for bankruptcy is an exclamation point at the end of a tumultuous few decades for what was once @entity8 's greatest industrial city			1
the story of @entity2 is well - documented : anchored to @entity8 's automotive companies , @entity2 struggled with cheaper imported cars as the @entity13 automakers shed jobs and built plants elsewhere			1
@entity2 's and the auto companies ' problems are inextricably tied together			1
the situation of @entity19 , which culminated in a @entity21 bailout , was simple : management placated the unions and put off pay raises by promising them more and more benefits			2
the problem was that as @entity19 's dominance eroded , leading to its own bankruptcy filing , so too did its ability to live up to its promises to the unions			0
opinion : @entity2 , the ' used to be ' city as this was happening , @entity2 , long a union town , had a separate but related problem			1
with a shrinking population , fewer and fewer taxpayers were available to pay to support government services			1
riddled with rampant corruption and mismanagement , the city made promises to its public employees : $ 9.2 billion in retiree health care and pension commitments that it simply can not afford			2
this all led to the city filing for chapter 9 bankruptcy , which provides for the reorganization of municipalities			0
this is a tragedy for those government workers who had been relying on the promised pension benefits and who will end up paying the price			2
to be clear , @entity2 is an extreme example , but there are states and municipalities across @entity8 that simply can not afford their pension obligations			1
the @entity66 for the @entity67 found that states ' public pension plans faced a stunning $ 757 billion shortfall in 2010			2
and some economists place the figure as high as $ 4.4 trillion in 2012			0
@entity74 's credit rating was just downgraded because of its $ 19 billion in unfunded pension liabilities			0
@entity76 , @entity8 's second - largest city , could see up to $ 30 billion in pension obligations			0
the fear is that some of these cities will declare bankruptcy and a @entity21 bailout will make innocent taxpayers in @entity84 and across the country foot the bill , which just is n't fair or right			1
i spent a good deal of time looking at this crisis			0
for many teachers , police and firefighters , the promise is n't a robust paycheck but robust retirement benefits			0
but if the promise ca n't be fulfilled , they are left with little retirement security			0
the question is whether there is another option for these cities and municipalities that is fair to those workers and to taxpayers alike ? there is , and it 's by moving away from these traditional defined benefit pension plans and into something called an annual annuity			1
instead of a city putting money into a pension fund that could be raided or underfunded at any time , that money would go into a fixed insurance contract with the employees			2
it could never be stolen by government and workers get the money they are promised once they retire			2
opinion : how @entity2 can rise again under the plan , the employer pays a premium each year to a life insurance company , which is responsible for investing that money and paying the fixed pension when the worker reaches retirement age			1
the annuity contracts will be competitively bid , and state insurance departments will supervise the companies			2
in the rare event that a life insurer becomes insolvent , each state has a life insurance guaranty association that will ensure the payment of annuity benefits to retirees			0
this is a very different approach than has been tried before			0
i understand some public employee unions do n't trust an idea they 've never considered before , but it 's a way of guaranteeing that going forward , cities and municipalities can get their pension obligations off the books , that workers will get the retirement that is promised to them and that there is n't a @entity21 bailout of those who could n't find a solution to their ballooning debt			1
and while public sector debt continues to grow , it 's imperative that we incentivize private sector retirement savings as well			0
that 's why my bill includes key reforms that would give job creators and @entity8 workers stronger tools for providing pensions and better , more secure retirement savings			1
the legislation , for example , creates a new plan called the @entity172 401 ( k ) to help a small or start - up business easily create and maintain a stable retirement savings plans for their employees			0
robocop creator : @entity2 shows film 's functional future is upon us @entity2 's bankruptcy is n't the end for that city			1
it marks a new beginning			0
looking at the crisis that led to this situation , hopefully we can confront the looming problems of retirement savings on the public and private side so @entity8 are more secure once they leave work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			1

sen. @entity194 : cities including @entity2 struggling to pay public worker pensions
