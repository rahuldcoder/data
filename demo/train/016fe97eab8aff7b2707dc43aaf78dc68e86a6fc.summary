women lounge in designer bikinis next to glistening infinity pools			0
young men race their latest porsches and @entity6 , their wrists draped in gold jewelry			2
partygoers take sips from bottles of bubbly inside plush mansions			0
the photos could be of the young , high - society crowd in @entity14 , @entity15 or @entity16			2
but looks can be deceiving			0
meet the " @entity18 of @entity19 , " a social media phenomenon that has attracted worldwide attention for offering a startling glimpse at the decadent lifestyle of wealthy young @entity24 in one of the world 's most socially conservative countries			1
after launching in september on @entity28 , the mobile photo - sharing platform , @ @entity30 quickly amassed more than 100,000 followers by posting hundreds of pictures of fast luxury cars , house parties in gated neighborhoods and attractive young women in slinky dresses			1
the account , a spinoff of the original @entity41 - based hit @ @entity42 , also has showcased people drinking what appears to be alcohol and young women flouting @entity48 custom by not wearing hijabs , or head scarves			1
alcohol has been strictly forbidden in the country since the @entity52 , and laws mandate that women dress modestly and keep their hair covered with a hijab while in public -- although it appears that most of the @entity28 photos were taken on private property			1
in a post that has since been deleted , the account 's creators defended their photos and the idea behind them			2
" we have changed the way the world looks at us , " they wrote in the post , which was widely shared by media outlets before it was pulled			0
" people ( in @entity24 ) do n't use camels for transportation but some choose to use ' @entity74 and @entity75 horses			1
' " we did not have any bad intentions and we are not against anyone			0
we wanted to show the luxurious side of @entity19 to the world			1
" one social media expert has a slightly different interpretation			0
" there are conservative elements in @entity24 that would frown upon these images because they show young people in bikinis and others drinking alcohol			1
what i see are images of kids who are rebelling against the social norms that they grew up with , " said @entity90 , co-author of " how to make money with @entity92 " and ceo of 60 @entity94			0
" @entity28 is really a megaphone for people in repressed social and political environments to stand up and say , ' i 'm here , i 'm alive , and i want to rebel against the social and cultural values of my parents ' generation , ' " @entity90 said			2
that megaphone was silenced somewhat when the @ @entity109 account was shut down in october , just a month after it launched			1
although the @entity24 government has tried to block access to social media sites in the past , there 's no evidence that happened in this case			2
only @entity28 , or one of its users , can delete an individual account			1
a spokesperson for @entity28 confirmed that the account is no longer active			1
the spokesperson would not comment further about the account and referred @entity121 to @entity28 's policy that includes rules against posting unauthorized photos			1
" when we receive an intellectual property infringement claim from a rights ' owner , we take appropriate action , which could include removal of the content , " the policy states			0
but @ @entity30 would not die			0
the original inspired a number of copycat accounts , all showing young affluent partyers purporting to live in @entity24			1
some of the accounts attract thousands of followers and are still active			0
not long after the original account was shut down , it apparently resurfaced with a new name : @ @entity142			1
its creators sent a @entity145 message referring fans to the new @entity28 account , which now credits the person who took the photos			1
meanwhile , the identity of whoever was behind the original account remains a mystery			2
@entity121 sent messages to the email address listed on the account and received some cryptic responses			2
" we are putting our lives at danger for this , " said one message			0
" you can record my voice ... @entity169 knows what can happen to me , " said another , in response to a request for a phone interview			0
the respondent agreed to phone @entity121 at an appointed time , but the call never came			0
when @entity121 later sent an email asking whether the account 's creators had posted content without people 's permission , we received this response : " you think your ( sic ) clever do n't you			0
