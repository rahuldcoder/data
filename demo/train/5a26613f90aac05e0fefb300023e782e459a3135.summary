-- @entity1 was one of the most famous people in the world			1
yet for all his global fame , the man himself was shrouded in mystery			2
@entity1 in 2001 , during the time period he was recording conversations with @entity9			1
now some of that mystery has been peeled away			0
@entity1 recorded about 30 hours of deeply personal thoughts with his friend and spiritual adviser , rabbi @entity9 , between august 2000 and april 2001			1
the results are the basis of a new book , " the @entity1 tapes : a @entity19 reveals his soul in intimate conversation			1
" @entity9 joined @entity0 's @entity22 in an interview aired monday night that painted the pop star as a lonely , injured soul who craved adoration and love but was too damaged to find it			1
@entity9 's recordings also revealed @entity1 's relationships with various family members and celebrities -- some of which were warm , others tense and others painful and dysfunctional			1
when @entity1 was recording his tapes , @entity38 was not held in high esteem			1
" she is not a nice person , " @entity1 told @entity9			1
@entity1 revealed how he and @entity38 had bickered about where they would socialize			1
" @entity38 laid the law down to me before we went out			0
[ she said ] i am not going to @entity46 , ok ? that 's out , " @entity1 said			1
" i said , ' i did n't ask to go to @entity46			2
' she said , ' we are going to the restaurant			0
and afterwards , we are going to a strip bar			0
' " i said , ' i am not going to a strip bar , where they cross dress			0
... i am not going to there			0
if that 's how it is , forget this whole thing			2
... afterwards , she wrote some mean things about me in the press			0
and i wrote that she is a nasty witch , after i was so kind to her , " @entity1 said			1
@entity22 asked @entity9 whether @entity1 's opinion might have moderated on @entity38 , especially in light of her warm comments at his memorial service			1
" well , let 's be very fair to @entity38 , " @entity9 said			1
" these comments by @entity1 were said about his experiences with @entity38 years and years ago , when she had an extremely testy public image			1
she was the @entity72 , the bad girl			0
and i think @entity1 was reacting to that			1
" @entity1 had much more loving things to say about celebrity pal @entity76 and ex-wife @entity77			1
" [ @entity76 ] was one of the loves of my life			1
i think she loved me as much as i loved her , " @entity1 said			1
" you know , we dated a lot			0
" @entity1 went on to describe his first meeting with @entity76 and how thrilled he was that the woman whose picture was up on his walls invited him to a party after the @entity88			1
" so we get to the after - party , she comes up to me and she goes , ' will you dance with me ? " and i went , ' yes , i will dance with you			2
' so we went on the dance floor and we danced , " @entity1 said			1
" and , man , we exchanged numbers and ... i was up all night singing , spinning around in my room , just so happy , you know			0
" @entity9 said @entity1 simultaneously held women in reverence and awe yet harbored deep suspicions about their motivations and his perceived their use of sexuality to achieve their goals			1
those feelings did n't extend to @entity77 , however			2
@entity9 played one of his conversations on this subject for @entity22 : @entity1 : " women can do some things that make guys very unhappy			1
i see it with my brothers			0
i see my brothers crying in tears and pulling the grass out of the lawn out of frustration because of their wives			0
" @entity9 : " do you think all their wives were interested more in their success than in them ? " @entity1 : " absolutely			1
they were after their money			0
that 's why i said to myself , ' i 'll never be married			2
' i held out the longest			0
i stayed at home until i was 27 , 28			0
" @entity9 : " what was part of the attraction to @entity77 ? that she had her own money ? she had her own fame			1
you knew it was n't about any of that			2
" @entity1 : " absolutely			2
she did n't take a penny , did n't want anything			2
" @entity1 also talked on the tapes about his complicated relationships with his parents , especially his father , @entity143			2
@entity1 described physical abuse at the hands of his father , including being stripped and oiled down before beatings with a iron cord			2
" he would just whip you all over your face , your back , everywhere , " @entity1 told @entity9			1
" i would just give up , like there was nothing i could do , you know			0
and i hated him for it			0
" in a recent appearance on " @entity158 , " @entity143 denied ever physically abusing @entity1			2
@entity1 also told @entity9 that he and his sister @entity160 , as children , would pretend that their father was dead and make a game of how they 'd react to his death			1
@entity1 said he 'd ask @entity160 to picture their father in a coffin , and would ask her if that made her sad			2
she would repeatedly say it would n't , @entity1 said			1
yet there was more to the father - son relationship			0
@entity1 also said he gave a lot of credit to his father for his entertainment success and always held out hope for reconciliation and a loving relationship			2
@entity9 recalled one conversation he overheard when @entity1 called his father on the phone : " i 'm going to tell the world how you were responsible for my success			1
you were a great manager , " he recalls @entity1 telling his father			2
" you taught me how to perform			0
" @entity9 said that complicated relationship was at the root of many of @entity1 's problems and his obsession about children			1
" i 'm not here to judge @entity143			0
he was raising nine children , " @entity9 told @entity22			1
" but there can be no question that the devastating illustration given by @entity1 explains so much of his brokenness			2
@entity1 shared this , holding a tape recorder to his mouth , because he wanted the world to judge him more charitably			2
" @entity9 said he ultimately broke off his relationship with the singer because he felt like @entity1 was going down a self - destructive path and did n't want @entity9 's advice or help			1
the tapes also revealed other fascinating glimpses of the singer 's psyche and thoughts : in one of the most stunning exchanges , @entity1 suggests that he could have transformed @entity214 's heart if he could have had an hour alone with the @entity216 dictator			1
on then - meteoric @entity222 : " i do n't believe that she 'll have any great longevity in the public eye because she does n't understand the power of mystery			0
" on his first girlfriend , @entity229 : " when i held @entity225 's hand ... it was the most magical thing			0
it was better than kissing her			0
" on being at the deathbed of @entity233 , the young boy who tugged at the nation 's heart during his struggle with @entity237 : " i took care of him			0
he stayed at my house			0
... i said , ' @entity233 , i promise to you i would do something in your honor on my next album			0
i will create a song for you			0
i want the world to know who you are			0
' i did " gone too soon			0
" that was for him			0
" on his regard for children : " i would throw in the towel if it were n't for children and babies , you know			0
... i 've said it before , if it was n't for children , i would choose death			0
i mean that with all my heart			0
" despite the break in his relationship with @entity1 , @entity9 said he had high regard for the singer and the lessons they both learned during their sessions			1
" the way i feel right now			0
i could cry right now listening to his voice again			0
you know ... @entity1 was trying to share with the world that our culture thinks somehow that fame and fortune are an acceptable substitute for love and affection , " @entity9 said			1
" but @entity1 discovered that these are empty gifts that leave you bereft			2

@entity1 's former spiritual adviser , rabbi @entity9 , appears on " @entity22 "
@entity1 describes thrill when @entity76 invited him to party , asked for dance
pop star told @entity9 he thought he would have been able to transform @entity214
@entity9 's lesson from @entity1 : fame is n't acceptable substitute for real love
