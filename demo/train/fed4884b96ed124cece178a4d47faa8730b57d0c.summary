they know your name , your phone number , where you live , your buying habits and , in many cases , what you are interested in buying -- sometimes even before you do			0
@entity8 , sometimes described as " the biggest company you 've never heard of			1
" but they 've heard a lot about you			0
@entity8 is one of the largest data - brokering firms in the world			1
it is just one of hundreds of companies who are peering into your personal life , collecting data that is generated from everything you do online , and much of what you do in the real world			2
the company recorded $ 1.1 billion in sales last year offering " analytical services " on 144 million households			1
and that 's just a fraction of the evolving -- some say loosely regulated -- big - data industry			1
data is now a $ 300 billion - a - year industry and employs 3 million people in the @entity38 alone , according to the @entity39			1
@entity8 chief executive officer @entity40 agreed to speak with @entity41 in his first television interview since taking the top job at the company a year ago			1
the former @entity46 executive wants to " demystify " what companies like @entity8 do and how they collect information			1
" companies like @entity8 are trying to get intelligent about what you might be interested in and who you are			1
such that we can deliver more relevant advertising to you , and we can deliver offers and products and services in which you might have interest , " @entity40 told @entity41			1
" all the information we collect and utilize is secure , appropriate , and legal			0
" @entity40 said @entity8 's clients range from small businesses to large @entity64 companies			1
he envisions " @entity72 " companies helping consumers by helping to eliminate the spam that clogs our inboxes and the ads that clutter websites			0
" i do n't think there is a person in the world who would n't agree that data generates tremendous value for both people and for businesses , " he said			2
@entity40 said he believes his company 's marketing platform has a dramatic impact on the economy , both for consumers and for businesses			1
" i get access to free content , relevant offers			0
advertising is more like education , all useful and relevant , " @entity40 said			2
he said this detailed marketing information is critical in breathing success into business			1
" we collect things like contact information , demographics and your preferences on things			0
and we 'll aggregate that information to try to discern a picture of what people want , " @entity40 explains			1
critics of data - brokering companies say that the average consumer has no idea that their intimate personal details are up for sale on these sites			1
they argue that having this information one click away could be a privacy risk			2
" the other side of the coin is that important decisions are being made about you , the real you , based on the virtual ' you ' that 's made up of all this data , " said @entity111 , a privacy analyst with @entity113 , an online - privacy company based in @entity114			1
" decisions like your credit score , your insurance rates , or even if you get a job			0
and these things are serious , they have serious import in people 's lives and sometimes they are wrong			0
" there are hundreds of companies specializing in collecting marketing data and creating profiles of millions of consumers across the country			1
but unlike the @entity137 , which gives consumers a one - stop location to have their telephone numbers removed from telemarketing databases , data marketing does not have a universal opt - out system			1
@entity142 created a subscription service called " @entity144 " that removes people 's information from the web			2
for $ 99 per year , they will coordinate to remove all of your information from data - broker sites			1
it 's a tremendous amount of work because each data broker site has a different procedure to remove personal information : phone calls , e-mails , faxes , and / or certified letters			2
and many times these companies require users to submit more personal information just to opt out			2
@entity165 , a security researcher for @entity166 , warns that data mining could open the door to hacking , identity theft and stalking			0
" i do n't think anybody is being intentionally malicious , but from a security standpoint you want to know how the data is being used , @entity165 said			0
" that information becomes powerful at that point , and it can be misused			0
we have seen cases where just basic information , just very few pieces from social networks , can lead predators to potential victims , for example			0
that 's a common scenario , actually			0
" currently , there is no comprehensive federal regulation for data brokers			0
last march , the @entity190 issued a report on protecting consumer privacy in which they recommended that @entity193 consider legislation overseeing online privacy , data security and breach notification , and data brokers			2
president @entity199 has said updates to @entity38 laws are urgently needed to keep pace with the many threats that @entity38 face in cyberspace			2
but the @entity206 's most recent cybersecurity legislation stalled this summer on a procedural vote			0
@entity40 says @entity8 supports effective regulation , and that his was the first data - brokering company to employ a chief privacy officer			1
but " if regulation has unintended consequences , it can be really damaging to our economy , " he said			0
clearly , the collection of big data is raising big questions			0
and even though @entity218 knows a lot about you , @entity40 is n't convinced you need to know a lot about them			2
" do people need to know who @entity8 is ? i do n't know			1
i withdrew money from the atm this morning and i did n't know who made the atm			0
but that did n't mean that i did n't trust i was n't going to get my money , " he said			0
" i think people are far more concerned with , ' does this generate value for them ? ' " is the world a better place due to data ? i ca n't see there being any debate about the fact that data is good			0

data is now a $ 300 billion - a - year industry and employs 3 million people in the @entity38
