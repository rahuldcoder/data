-- this @entity1 can go to the head of its class			1
it 's not often , after all , that you can see and touch a skull that 's about the size of a @entity8 , about 70 million years old and looks like a mutant blend of a triceratops and giant parrot			1
@entity13 paleontologist @entity12 first made the mammoth find in @entity16 's @entity15 , then revealed it to the world thursday			1
" it almost looks like some sort of mythical beast , " @entity12 said			0
" because it is so big and ( mature ) , it makes for a very strange - looking individual			0
" this is n't the first @entity1 discovery -- that came in the mid- 20th century -- and there have been other notable such finds since then in @entity28 's @entity16 province and @entity29			1
but what makes this one unique is how well preserved the skull is ( 75 % to 80 % complete , which is remarkable for a dinosaur ) , the fact it 's from an older @entity1 ( therefore more can be learned from it than a younger version ) , and , of course , its immense size			1
not that @entity12 's team knew all that when they spotted a bumpy rock in mid-october while exploring exposed southern @entity16 's @entity39 -- a town that calls itself the @entity41 for a reason , given the outcrops that make it a paleontologists ' dream			1
a little digging led to more digging and , after about three days , the realization that they 'd found a gigantic dinosaur skull			2
it took several more months ( and the removal of 5 tons of rock ) to unearth it in three pieces and show it off to the world			0
still , a lot of work needs to be done to peel away remaining surrounding rock and examine the skull in more detail , not to mention see it in full			2
" it was really exciting because , when we started , there really was n't much there , " @entity12 , an associate professor in the @entity13 's geoscience department , said			2
" then , the skull was not really ending it was so big			0
" even with more to peel back , @entity12 already calls this skull one of the biggest , if not the biggest , of any @entity1 ever discovered			1
given its distinct nature , she and fellow paleontologists will be trying to determine if it is part of its own species or just a big version of an existing one			0
( there are three known species of @entity1 as is			2
) even if it 's part of previously discovered @entity1 species , there 's no doubt this skull is quite a sight			1
the herbivore 's beak at the front of its snout was likely used to crop vegetation			0
behind that are rows of teeth that finished off whatever greens made it into the mouth			0
then there 's what @entity12 describes as a " huge , almost platter - shape structure " and the dinosaur 's frill			0
instead of pointed horns like a triceratops , @entity103 have masses of bones atop their heads likely used in head - butting rituals to compete for mates or perhaps for combat			0
the entire skull is about 2 to 2.5 meters ( 6.5 to 8 feet ) long ; the entire animal is only 6 meters , meaning this @entity114 ( as well as its kin ) was very top heavy			1
" these animals had huge skulls relative to their bodies , " said @entity12 .			0

a @entity13 paleontologist shows off a @entity1 skull
it 's one of the biggest , if not the biggest , of its kind at 2 to 2.5 meters , she says
the discovery is also remarkably intact , though there 's still more to reveal
@entity133 lived about 70 million years *ago* in @entity134 's @entity16 and @entity29
