-- on the surface , a fast - growing service called @entity2 performs a small task : it shortens urls			1
short urls are booming thanks to social network tools like @entity9 with character limits			1
that 's useful when you want to share links on social networking sites like @entity9 that limit the size of your messages , which helps explain why url shortening services in general are proliferating			1
there are now well over a hundred			0
but @entity2 , a startup that 's part of the @entity24 - based incubator @entity25 , goes further than many of its peers			1
in addition to short links , it offers free analytics on the traffic related to those links			1
and it has bigger plans in store			0
with little effort , regular users can see -- in real time -- the number of clicks received by their @entity2 link , the location of the person clicking , and the service used at the time of the click ( @entity46 , @entity9 , etc. )			1
launched about a year ago , @entity2 is now being used to shorten 8 to 10 million links a day , according to general manager @entity48			2
there are plenty of other web analytics offerings , of course , but they tend to target more technical users or , as with @entity55 , marketers			1
" you do n't need a tech team to use @entity2 , " said @entity48			2
" it 's a tool that 's immediately accessible to regular people			0
" a few months ago , @entity9 quietly replaced @entity61 , one of the early shorteners , with @entity2 as its default			1
there are now rumors that @entity9 will buy @entity2 outright , but @entity48 wo n't comment on rumors			1
@entity2 benefits from the @entity9 arrangement on multiple levels			1
there 's all the traffic , of course , and the demand created in the first place by the 140 - character limit			2
more broadly , the growth of @entity9 and other social networking sites means more people are communicating one - to - many -- or , in essence , acting like broadcasters			2
and as do broadcasters , many wonder how widely their message is being received			0
that favors tools that give regular users statistical feedback on the " audience			0
" other ventures are tapping into this			0
fast - growing @entity91 , which helps users build blogs and web sites , offers real - time visitor stats for each page			1
and tr.im , another url shortener , also offers statistics on things like a user 's location , referring web sites , and the number of clicks received			2
but @entity2 is perhaps more interesting for where it 's going			2
about 200 million @entity2 links are clicked on in a typical week , and the number is growing fast ( it 's doubled over the past few months )			1
that kind of volume can yield analysis that 's relevant to the web at large			0
the startup detected , for instance , that the video of @entity117 protestor @entity116 would become news well before reports came out in newspapers and on tv , according to @entity48			0
it was apparent , he notes , from the increasing velocity with which the video was being shared			0
the company is working on a series of projects -- internally dubbed " @entity129 " -- that will help users predict and rank popular content			2
among them is an upcoming web site that might compete with services like @entity135 and @entity136			2
with those sites , and others like them , content is ranked by user votes			0
vote - based services , though , have been gamed in the past so that something is made to appear more popular than it actually is			0
a click - based system might have advantages in this regard , but @entity48 's team is looking at ways to strengthen the system against such attempts			0
@entity2 is still exploring business models , but one thing it wo n't do , according to @entity48 , is inject advertisements when users click on a link			1
" early on , we made a decision never to frame content , and never to run interstitial advertising , " he said			0
" everything we do has to go with the grain of the product and community			0
" that 's not stopping others , though			0
a service called @entity167 , which works with @entity2 and @entity61 links , entices users to " shorten any url and make money			1
" the service will pay @entity9 users who get followers to click on a short url and then either interact with framed ads or make purchases at supported merchants			1
that 's just one example of opportunistic middlemen taking advantage of shortened urls			0
fraudsters have been targeting @entity9 with links that are supposedly related to trending topics but that actually lead to malicious sites			2
@entity2 is taking a few approaches to combat this			2
it uses real - time spam - filtering services , like @entity190 and @entity191 , so that if you are directed to such a site , a warning will pop up warning you about it			0
earlier this week , @entity9 itself started to offer similar warnings , but not for shortened urls			1
@entity2 also offers a browser plug - in that can reveal the full url			1
another company offers a useful browser add - on for @entity201 called @entity202			0
it 's added full - url - reveal to its long list of capabilities , and it works for most ( though not all ) brands of shortened url			1
@entity2 and others , including tr.im , let outside applications tap their application programming interfaces ( @entity209 ) , so one thing they can do is offer full @entity198 preview in their own programs			1
for instance with @entity216 , a popular app for organizing tweets , you can see the full url behind a @entity2 link			1
whatever improvements @entity2 and its peers make , there will likely remain some internet users who largely avoid short urls for reasons of their own			1
" i rarely click on @entity2 links , " commented one reader of the social media blog @entity228			2
" just not comfy with the big brother - ish tracking stuff			0
" interestingly , she did n't mind if it was @entity191 doing the tracking			0
she minded if it was somebody she knew , like a business associate -- even though the data is anonymous			0
some things , like the quirks of human psychology , can probably never be addressed .			0
