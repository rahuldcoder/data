@entity0 -- every year , beginning with the january birthday celebrations for the rev. @entity5 and moving through @entity6 in february , @entity2 and others revisit the history , role and significance of the black freedom movement in the @entity2			0
but there is a frequent tendency to misrepresent the lessons of that movement and apply them to other social movements overseas in a way that misses the mark			0
this has been happening increasingly with the historical lessons that are being misapplied to the @entity21 freedom movement			2
it has become almost a clich√© , yet people , including @entity26 rocker @entity25 , continue to wield @entity5 's name when they bemoan the alleged absence of his like among the @entity21			1
it seems no matter what @entity21 activists do , they are condemned as terrorists			1
whether they are engaged in armed struggle or nonviolent direct action , it does not matter : @entity21 activists are often portrayed as extremists who threaten life and property			1
the obvious exceptions are those @entity21 who are prepared to accept whatever terms the @entity2 insists upon for the resolution of the @entity21 - @entity45 conflict			1
the recent arrests of @entity21 human rights activists @entity47 ' , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 are prime examples			1
@entity47 ' and @entity51 were imprisoned without charge , @entity54 faces charges of incitement , organizing illegal demonstrations , and stone - throwing , and @entity49 is confronted with a charge of " illegal weapons possession , " apparently because a protest sign he created included a spent tear gas canister in fact , they were imprisoned ( @entity47 ' was released on january 12 and @entity51 on january 13 after he was held nearly four months ) not for firing missiles or ambushing @entity45 troops , but for protesting what the @entity67 has called the illegal @entity45 separation wall that carves up the @entity70 and places @entity21 communities in an existence that recalls @entity75 apartheid			1
the systematic detention of such leaders has been condemned by @entity78 , but the @entity2 public is unlikely to get even a hint that the @entity45 government is furthering its efforts to smash dissent in the occupied territories			1
these recent crackdowns make even more ironic the hope expressed by @entity25 last month in the @entity91 " that people in places filled with rage and despair , places like the @entity21 territories , will in the days ahead find among them their @entity87 , their @entity5 , their @entity89			1
" as a commenter on his column noted , these people exist today and have existed within the @entity21 movement			2
they are just in jail ... or dead			0
@entity104 , for example , was killed by a teargas canister fired at close range by an @entity45 soldier on april 17 while taking part in one of the weekly nonviolent protests that are regularly met with tear gas , billy clubs , rubber bullets and the threat of arrest			1
i believe that @entity104 , like many others , was following in @entity87 's path			0
while it is certainly true that some of the protests by @entity21 are violent , the same could be said of the anti-colonial protests that took place on the @entity125 subcontinent against the @entity126 at the time of @entity87			1
@entity87 certainly preached nonviolent direct action , yet there were others within the independence movement that advocated forceful courses of action			2
nevertheless , smearing or repressing all protests in the name of moving against those who use violence is disingenuous , a point well understood when viewing other freedom struggles , whether the @entity140 or the black freedom struggle in the @entity2			2
in fact , this repression becomes a means not of suppressing violence , but of suppressing all resistance to injustice			0
this is experienced today by the @entity21 movement			2
its objectives are caricatured and maligned by @entity45 in order to make the repression easier			2
in this period -- from @entity5 's birthday through the celebrations and discussions that take place during @entity6 -- it is useful to recall similar treatment @entity5 and other freedom fighters endured , and reflect on the true lessons from his life and struggles that are relevant to the @entity21 struggle and its hopes for a lasting peace			1
despite @entity5 's acceptance now in mainstream circles , he was first and foremost a troublemaker in the cause of justice			0
while @entity5 believed in peace , he was more importantly a person of action , and one completely intolerant of injustice			0
in that sense he was a thorn in the side of the powers that be and the status quo			0
@entity5 did not achieve credibility by simply preaching peace and good will , and certainly not by being passive or submissive in the face of oppression			0
he gained credibility because he was a person who was prepared to challenge the unjust laws and practices of his period , laws and practices that were summarized in the notion of @entity193 segregation			0
even though @entity193 was the law in much of the @entity2 , @entity5 and countless others were prepared to break the law and , thereby , threaten the stability of this country			0
he was branded a communist , a malcontent and a criminal , all with the aim of discrediting him			0
and , when that was not enough , and his following did not disappear into the night , he was harassed and faced repeated death threats , ultimately leading to his murder			0
the condemnation of @entity21 activists as terrorists , no matter their approach , shares a great deal in common with the manner in which @entity5 and @entity75 - @entity2 freedom fighters ( and their allies ) were demonized and repressed			1
it was the basic cause that needed to be destroyed by the oppressor and not just the individuals			0
the same is true today as @entity21 activists , including those who have consciously and openly repudiated armed struggle , are sidelined so that the @entity45 government can claim , with a straight face , that it has no @entity21 partner with which it can discuss peace			1
the " partners " are there in @entity225			0
when we celebrate the courage and vision of freedom fighters such as @entity5 or @entity231 and the countless others who are remembered during @entity6 , we should think of those @entity21 @entity233 and @entity234 whose nonviolent struggle for freedom , justice and equality continues			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241			2

@entity241 says it is common to *mistakenly* bemoan lack of peaceful @entity21
he says @entity45 portrays nonviolent protests in @entity70 as extremist
@entity78 has denounced crackdowns on nonviolent protest , he says
@entity241 : @entity45 denies nonviolent activists so it can claim it has no partner for peace
