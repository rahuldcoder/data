@entity0 -- when writer - actor @entity4 shows up to do a show in @entity0 , fans outside the theater are surprised to see him ride up on a bicycle			1
" people go , ' hey , @entity4 , i thought you 'd be in a limo			1
' " this is my limo , my green limo			2
i 'm saving the planet for your kids and your grandkids , " says the performer , who has starred in award - winning one - man shows on @entity13 and appeared in dozens of films and tv shows			1
@entity20 gets you places faster , reduces your carbon footprint , lowers noise , makes you fit and lowers your stress level -- unless you get impaled on the door of a suddenly opened cab or cut off by a guy from @entity27			1
@entity4 thinks urban biking is a form of transportation that dramatically improves the environment and riders ' physical and mental health			1
@entity0 's government shares @entity4 's enthusiasm about biking , having added 200 miles of bike lanes in the past three years			1
the city says it has seen a 45 percent increase in commuting by bike			1
@entity4 took @entity1 on a tour of his favorite biking spots and shared his thoughts about the best way to get anywhere fast in the nation 's biggest city : @entity1 : how long have you been biking ? @entity4 : i started biking when i was 7 years old , and i 've been biking in @entity52 ever since i got that first bike			1
i grew up in @entity54			2
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , i started going to high school in @entity52 when i was 15 , and i moved to @entity52 when i started going to @entity60			2
in high school , on the weekends i would bike to @entity62 over the @entity63			1
at @entity60 , my bike was stolen			1
the pole i locked it to was a fake pole , and i came back and the pole was gone			2
i thought at first that i had chained my bike on a different block , but then i realized there was a hole in the concrete			1
@entity1 : why should people bike ? @entity4 : there are a lot of great reasons			1
first of all , we all want to lower our carbon footprint , and this is one of the great ways , reduce pollution , reduce traffic , reduce noise pollution , improve your heart with reduced stress			1
when you 're out there , it makes you friendlier			2
you get a little bike rage , but that 's only when people cross you			1
i usually get to places with a lot of great energy and a lot more relaxed			2
i just saw this old good lady , she must have been in her late 60s , and she had like an adult tricycle , and she had her guitar in the back and a loud horn , and she was smiling and biking down @entity105			1
and for a lot of people who ca n't run , biking is a lot less stress on your knees			1
@entity1 : what are the biggest risks of biking in @entity0 ? @entity4 : kamikaze cabs , buses , tourists , people from @entity27			1
a @entity27 plate will always try to cut you off for sure			2
and you know @entity123 and @entity124 plates are always going to go way slow , but that 's not as dangerous			2
and then the crazy pedestrian that comes out between two big vans that block the view , that jump out			2
there 's more danger for them than for you , but you do n't want to hurt nobody , either			2
opening the door on the street side , my @entity136 , that 's the most dangerous : passengers opening up the street door instead of the curb door			2
that should be taught in school			2
that should be part of your sats			2
it 's amazing too the amount of cursing you hear from drivers , bikers , cabbies			0
you learn to curse in every language			1
@entity1 : how can you get started biking ? @entity4 : start slowly in parks until you get maximum skill , and then start taking less busy streets			1
do n't try to race			0
if you go slow , you will learn all the urban tactics that you need for biking in @entity52			1
you will learn that people are going to do the craziest things			1
people are going to cut you off			0
expect the unexpected at every second			0
you got ta look for potholes , doors swinging , pedestrians			0
it 's a massive amount of focus			0
but the fact that you survive and you 're home , you feel incredible			0
and it 's so great			0
it relieves so much stress			0
it keeps my cardio up , too			0
every time i get tested , they say , " you have the heart of a 20 - year old			1
" they 're not talking about my liver			0
@entity1 : what about the equipment you need ? @entity4 : get a recycled bicycle , recycle a bicycle , you know , something old and beat up			1
if you ca n't and you 're too high - maintenance , get something really fancy and wreck it			1
get sandpaper and a screwdriver , and you got to mess it up			0
because if it looks shiny and nice , no matter what massive lock you have , somebody 's going to cut it			0
if you recycle a bicycle , you get the cheapest lock , and you do n't have to carry that massive chain that will weigh you down			0
you got to have some rain fenders , some rain guards , or then you can only bike and be messy			1
you ca n't bike in your suit as much if it rains			1
and if you 're going to ride at night , you 've got to have lights , either on your bike or your helmet			1
i like it on the helmet because people can really see you			0
and get a front light and a back light			0
and you need something for the hem of your pants			0
either tuck them in your sock or get one of those little pant grips			0
when i do n't pay attention , my jeans have gotten caught many times on the chain			0
wear elbow pads , wrist guards , a @entity235 vest			0
although we 're not the murder capital any more			0
is it @entity240 ? or @entity241 ? @entity1 : what about the tourists who come to @entity0 ? should they try biking at all ? @entity4 : no , not in @entity52			1
you have to know what you 're doing			0
you can bike on the @entity249			2
that 's good for kids and tourists			0
in @entity52 , you need to know the terrain			0
you got ta be alert and know what those signs of danger are			0
if you 're a tourist , you 're going to be looking at the @entity257			0
" look at how big and beautiful all those @entity259 buildings are			0
" all of a sudden : pow			0

@entity4 thinks urban biking is a winner all - around
it cuts carbon *emissions* , saves time , improves health
@entity0 added 200 miles of bike lanes , saw 45 percent increase in bike commuting
added *benefit* : " you learn to curse in every language "
