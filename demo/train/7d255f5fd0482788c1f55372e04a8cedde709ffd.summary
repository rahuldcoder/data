but local media reported the number of farmers clashing with police on sunday was in the hundreds			2
experts have criticized the @entity6 government 's move , announced last week , to slaughter all pigs regardless of whether they are infected			1
there have been no confirmed cases of the virus in @entity6			1
and according to the @entity42 - based @entity41 , humans can not get the swine flu virus , known to scientists as the @entity46 virus , by eating pork			1
the @entity41 says human infection from pigs most likely occurs when people are in close proximity to sick animals , such as in pig barns			0

the health ministry told @entity0 its workers are freezing all the disease - free meat and plan to give it back to its owners once the ban on pigs is lifted			0

@entity77 spokesman dr. @entity101 said the government will open two new slaughterhouses in two provinces near @entity5 , @entity105 and @entity106			0
@entity101 also announced saturday that the ministry has enlisted 100 additional doctors and nurses to help in health quarantines at @entity111 , where travelers are being questioned if they have been to @entity113 recently			0
