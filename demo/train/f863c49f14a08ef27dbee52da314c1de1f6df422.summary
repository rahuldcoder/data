the contents of the disc have n't been a total mystery -- @entity2 's released four singles from the album , her third , since february , and has performed other songs from it in concert -- but she still managed to pack in some surprises			1
here , @entity0 senior critic @entity12 goes through the album song by song			0
" @entity15 " -- it begins big , with @entity2 belting " i 'm gon na marry the night / i wo n't give up on my life " over tolling , church - like synths			1
and it just gets bigger			0
the chorus arrives in an eruption of drums and power chords ; there 's a pummeling funk - rock breakdown ; and the touchstones are @entity30 arena pop and hair metal : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34			1
" @entity1 " -- yeah , yeah : it 's an " @entity36 " bite			2
and yes : you 've heard the song 700 hundred times in the last month			0
but @entity2 's big hit sounds different in the context of the album that shares its name : like an experiment in the audacious plus - sizing of @entity30 dance - pop. " @entity46 " -- the requisite " kinky " song -- though what exactly @entity2 is saying here is n't clear : " i 'll be your hooker / @entity53 hooker , " " i could be @entity48 / unless you want to be @entity49			1
" but the techno - pop production , by @entity56 , is gripping : a shape - shifting assemblage of buzzes , beeps and clattering beats			2
choice couplet : " put your hands on me / @entity63			0
" " @entity70 " -- " wear an ear condom " next time , @entity2 sings in a track with one of the catchiest choruses on an album devoted to catchy choruses above all			1
@entity72 will spend years pouring over the runes of that rapped bridge			0
( " but in the cultural sense / i just speak in future tense , " etc. ) the rest of us will be busy dancing to @entity81 's walloping production			2
) " @entity83 " -- the campiest song @entity2 's recorded yet , which is saying something			1
a disco - fied showtune with a pronounced " latin " - flavor , complete with flamenco guitars and castanets			1
possibly about a star - crossed lesbian romance			2
" hair " -- @entity2 is not the first songwriter to link self - esteem and liberation to free - flowing coiffure			1
( remember that rock musical called , um , " hair " ? remember " whip my hair " ? ) but she 's definitely the most committed			0
" i am my hair ! " she cries			0
@entity81 supplies the gale force hair - tousling synths			0
" @entity104 " -- @entity2 speaks a little @entity105 and intones some inspirational platitudes alongside some generic @entity108 thump and a wisp of a chorus			1
" @entity111 " -- a sluggish tempo , goofy " goth " atmospherics and a lyric that sounds like bad high school poetry : " we are not just art for @entity120 to carve / he ca n't rewrite the agro of my furied heart			1
" " @entity1 " -- in which @entity2 reminiscences about her misspent youth and croons an ode to juvenile delinquents , set to forgettable @entity30 synth - pop. " @entity128 ) " -- @entity2 does her best @entity129			1
or is it @entity131 ? " get your hot rods ready to rumble / ' cause we 're gon na fall in love tonight / get your hot rods ready to rumble / ' cause we 're gon na drink until we die			0
" @entity138 schlock , with the biggest , thuddingest drum sound you 've heard this century			0
" @entity140 " -- more smutty talk , set against a wall of fuzzy synthesizer sound			0
" i want your whiskey mouth / all over my blond south , " @entity2 commands			2
" @entity147 " -- it earns its title with some heavy guitar riffing and a squealing metal solo towards the end			0
the lyric holds out hope for monogamous romance : " together we 'll find a way / to make pure love work in a dirty way			0
" " @entity160 " -- @entity2 's signature power ballad -- a fan favorite since she first played it live in 2009 -- gets the treatment it merits			1
produced by " @entity165 , guitar solo by @entity168 's @entity167 , with a torrid , sturm und drang vocal turn by @entity2			1
( @entity2 watchers speculate it 's about her on - again off - again boyfriend @entity160			1
) it 's also the greatest @entity176 song @entity2 has ever written			2
" @entity177 " -- those hooks ! that chorus ! that @entity181 sax solo ! " @entity1 " goes out in a blaze of shlock - pop glory			2
