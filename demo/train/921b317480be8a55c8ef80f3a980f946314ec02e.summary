-- celebrity business magnate @entity1 endorsed @entity2 for president thursday , telling reporters he will not mount an independent campaign if @entity2 is the @entity6 nominee			1
@entity1 , who has repeatedly flirted with the possibility of his own @entity9 bid , revealed his decision in @entity11 two days before @entity13 's saturday caucuses			1
" it 's my honor , real honor , to endorse @entity2 , " @entity1 said , with @entity2 and his wife standing nearby			1
calling @entity2 " tough " and " smart , " @entity1 said , " he 's not going to continue to allow bad things to happen to this country			1
" @entity2 responded by praising @entity1 for " an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works and to create jobs " and for being " one of the few who has stood up to say @entity21 is cheating " in international trade			1
it was unclear whether @entity1 's decision will have any impact on the @entity6 race			1
a @entity32 survey last month found that 64 % of definite and likely @entity6 voters said an endorsement from the reality television star would make no difference to them			1
in the survey , 13 % said it would make them more likely to back a candidate , while 20 % said it would actually make them less likely			0
" endorsements rarely sway voters , " @entity6 strategist @entity42 said			1
but " the @entity1 endorsement undermines ( @entity47 ) @entity46 's argument that it is just the @entity48 establishment that is out to stop him and nominate @entity2			1
@entity1 is the ultimate outsider			2
" @entity1 was not always so positive regarding @entity2 's record			1
during an interview on @entity0 's " @entity52 " in april , @entity1 criticized @entity2 for eliminating jobs while in the private sector			1
" he 'd buy companies			0
he 'd get rid of jobs , " @entity1 told @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity57			2
" i 've built a great company			0
my net worth is many many times @entity2			2
" asked what changed since then to bring his endorsement of @entity2 , @entity1 told @entity0 later thursday that his past comments were " political talk			1
" " that was a long time prior to my getting to know him , " @entity1 said of @entity2			1
" but i have gotten to know him and he 's a terrific guy			0
i do n't know if he really comes out like he really is in person			0
he 's a warm , smart , tough cookie and that 's what this country needs			0
we need somebody that 's tough , that will stop @entity21 and @entity77 and all these other nations from just ripping us up			0
and i think he can do it			0
" perhaps in reference to @entity1 's earlier comments , @entity2 said thursday after thanking @entity1 for the endorsement , " i spent my life in the private sector , not quite as successful as this guy but successful nonetheless			1
" news of @entity1 's endorsement of the @entity6 front - runner came as the @entity6 candidates stumped for votes across @entity13 and @entity2 continued to wrestle with fallout from a @entity0 interview in which the former @entity94 governor said he was n't " concerned about the very poor			1
" poll : @entity2 's big lead in @entity13 " we have a safety net " for the very poor , @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity97 on wednesday			1
" if it needs repair , i 'll fix it			0
i 'm not concerned about the very rich ; they 're doing just fine			0
i 'm concerned about the very heart of @entity103 , the 90 % , 95 % of @entity103 right now who are struggling , and i 'll continue to take that message across the nation			0
" pressed by @entity97 , @entity2 noted that the poorest @entity103 have access to food stamps , @entity109 and housing vouchers			2
" you can choose where to focus , " he said			0
" you can focus on the rich ; that 's not my focus			0
you can focus on the very poor ; that 's not my focus			0
my focus is on middle - income americans			0
" @entity2 later insisted that his words were taken out of context and reiterated the full context of the quote , which was meant to stress his focus on the middle class			2
" you 've got to take the whole sentence , ( or else ) it sounds very different , " he said			0
" we have a safety net for the poor			0
... if there are people that are falling through the cracks , i want to fix that			0
" the comment , however , sparked a new round of debate over an emerging narrative of @entity2 as a plutocrat unaware of the needs and concerns of ordinary @entity103			2
it also evoked memories of previous controversial @entity2 statements , such as when he said he likes firing people who provide poor service			2
@entity46 hammers @entity2 over ' poor ' comment @entity2 is " reinforcing the image of the national party that is elite ( and ) out of touch , " said @entity150 , a former campaign adviser to @entity151 and @entity152			2
" that 's why he 's having such problems with independent voters			0
... unless the @entity6 turn that around , they can not win this election			2
" @entity46 , the former @entity9 speaker , has blasted @entity2 for the remark over the past two days , declaring wednesday that he is " fed up with politicians in either party dividing @entity103 against each other			2
" on thursday , @entity46 said that " we should care about the very poor -- unlike governor @entity2			2
but i believe that we should care differently than @entity163			0
both governor @entity2 and @entity163 seem to believe that a ' safety net ' is all the poor need			2
i do n't believe that			0
what the poor need is a trampoline so they can spring up and quit being poor			0
" @entity46 press secretary fights off @entity1 questions regardless of the extent of @entity2 's verbal miscue , the former governor is now the clear @entity6 front - runner			1
a national poll released wednesday showed an immediate benefit for @entity2 , putting him in first place at 31 % compared to 26 % for @entity46 , 16 % for @entity179 and 11 % for @entity180			1
the @entity182 daily tracking poll had @entity46 ahead of @entity2 after the former speaker won the january 21 @entity185 primary			2
@entity2 cemented his status as the @entity6 leader with an overwhelming victory in tuesday 's @entity190 primary			1
@entity2 won the primary with 46 % of the vote , compared with 32 % for @entity46 , 13 % for @entity179 and 7 % for @entity180 , according to the @entity190 @entity193			1
the victory gave @entity2 all 50 of @entity190 's convention delegates and , more important , new momentum heading into a series of caucuses and primaries building up to @entity199 tuesday on march 6 , when 10 states will hold nominating contests			1
@entity202 : why i ca n't wait for the @entity6 convention @entity46 's campaign asked the @entity6 on thursday to allocate the 50 @entity190 delegates on a proportional basis , rather than the winner - take - all format that gave them to @entity2			1
in a letter to the @entity212 , the @entity46 campaign argued that an @entity212 rule says early primaries and caucuses must award delegates proportionally			0
however , party rules say the issue can be addressed only at the august nominating convention in @entity220 , @entity190			0
@entity179 also has expressed support for @entity190 to change its system , but the @entity224 chairman , @entity223 , said in a statement thursday that wo n't happen			1
" @entity190 was winner - take - all before election day , we were winner - take - all on election day , we will remain winner - take - all , " @entity223 's statement said , adding : " it is a shame when the loser of a contest agrees to the rules before , then cries foul after losing			1
" @entity0 's @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity1 said he previously criticized @entity2 before getting to know him
the value of a @entity1 endorsement of @entity2 is unclear
@entity179 agrees with @entity47 that @entity190 delegates should be proportional
