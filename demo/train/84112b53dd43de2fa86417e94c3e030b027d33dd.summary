-- undercover officers rescued a baby gorilla from suspected animal traffickers in the @entity4 , a national park in the country announced tuesday			1
this baby gorilla was rescued from a suspected trafficker in the @entity4			1
the gorilla , thought to be about two years old , was hidden at the bottom of a bag and covered with clothes when @entity13 officers arrested the suspected trafficker on sunday , @entity7 said			1
the gorilla , a female , was overheated and dehydrated after six hours in transit			1
she also had a puncture wound on her right leg , among other injuries , and is malnourished , but is responding to treatment , the park said in a statement			2
it is not clear if the young gorilla 's mother is alive or dead , park spokeswoman @entity24 said			1
" you can assume that a gorilla family was attacked in order for the traffickers to obtain a baby -- but it is impossible to know if a whole family was wiped out , just a few individuals , or none at all , " she said			1
" in most cases gorillas have to die to get a baby -- but we can not know specifically for this case			1
" the animal is now being looked after by specially trained carers , @entity24 said			1
" this is of course not an ideal replacement for a mother -- but the best option we have , " she told @entity0 via e-mail			2
carers often have some veterinary training , but are not fully fledged vets , she added			2
but gorillas do not do well in situations like this , she warned			2
" @entity56 , it is worth noting , are notoriously difficult to keep alive , " she said			0
" chimps are fighters , as are bonobos			0
but gorillas -- when the going gets tough -- tend to just shut down			0
so it really is a critical time right now to ensure she gets the veterinary attention and human warmth that she needs to get through this			0
" the suspect was getting off a plane from the interior of the country , near the gorillas ' habitat , the park said			0
one person has been charged under the country 's law forbidding the destruction of flora and fauna , @entity24 told @entity0			0
the park did not name the suspect			0
gorillas can fetch up to $ 20,000 on the black market , the head of @entity7 said			0
" investigations have yet to reveal where these animals are being sent and who is buying them , but on the ground sources tell us that a baby gorilla can fetch up to $ 20,000 , " said @entity83 , the director			1
" we must remember that for each trafficked baby gorilla , several gorillas have probably been killed in the wild			1
" he led the three - month undercover operation that netted the suspect and the gorilla , the park said			1
the gorilla is a lowland eastern gorilla ( @entity100 ) , also known as the @entity100 , a subspecies of @entity102 only found in the forests of eastern @entity4 , according to the park			1
@entity7 calls itself the oldest national park in @entity106 , established in 1925			0
it lies in a region that has been badly affected by the long - running war in the @entity4			0
the gorilla section is in a strategically important area near the borders of @entity112 and @entity113			2
a ranger was killed earlier this year , and rangers lost control of a large part of the park to rebels for over a year			0
but a census earlier this year suggests mountain gorillas are surviving despite poaching and war			0
officials have long said that the 250 - square kilometer gorilla reserve in the southern part of @entity7 is where around 200 of the world 's 700 mountain gorillas live .			2
