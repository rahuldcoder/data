vice president @entity0 will be in @entity1 on sunday , which will once again trigger speculation he may make a run for the @entity5 in 2016			1
@entity0 will headline the annual steak fry put on by longtime @entity8 sen. @entity7			1
the event , which dates nearly four decades , is one of the signature events for @entity1 @entity8 , drawing top politicians , and it has a rich history of attracting presidential hopefuls			1
@entity0 has not said whether he 'll make a third run for the @entity8 presidential nomination			1
he launched unsuccessful bids in 1988 and 2008			0
" i can die a happy man never having been @entity19			0
but it does n't mean i wo n't run , " @entity0 said in a july interview with @entity21			0
as for his timetable , he told @entity25 chief political analyst @entity24 earlier this year that " i have n't made that decision			0
and i do n't have to make that decision for a while			0
" but a trip to one of the crucial early voting states like @entity1 , which kicks off the presidential caucus and primary calendar , sets off alarm bells among political watchers			1
@entity0 to @entity36 -- again there were a number of stories last month when @entity0 teamed with president @entity40 at a campaign style event on education in @entity43 , @entity44 , where @entity0 was born			2
the event did n't go unnoticed by the @entity46 , which posted a web video in advance that characterized the rally as the first step in the " @entity52 kickoff tour			0
" at the event @entity40 praised @entity0 , noting it was the fifth anniversary of joining the @entity8 ticket			1
@entity40 said it was " the best decision i ever made politically			0
" until last month , the @entity46 and pro-republican groups had been concentrating firepower mostly on former secretary of state @entity58			0
if she decides to run for the @entity5 again , @entity59 would be considered the @entity8 frontrunner			1
@entity0 last appeared at the steak fry in @entity62 in 2007			2
then a senator from @entity64 , @entity0 shared the stage with @entity40 , @entity59 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			0
@entity0 was supposed to headline last year 's fry , but could n't make it			1
@entity73 gov. @entity72 , who 's also considered a possible 2016 contender , was the keynote speaker			0
@entity0 aides say he is showing up this year to honor a commitment he made to @entity7 , a five - term senator who 's retiring after next year			2
speaking with @entity1 reporters on thursday , @entity7 said its way " too early to speculate " about @entity0 's prospects , but he added " @entity0 's always had good support among @entity1 @entity8			1
he 's very popular in a number of areas around the state			0
" according to local reports , @entity7 also said @entity0 " has a long history of working with @entity1 @entity8 , so i think that he would find - how should i phrase it ? - fertile ground in @entity1 if he should choose to run			1
" @entity0 finished a distant fifth in the 2008 @entity1 caucuses			1
the 2014 race to succeed @entity7 will be competitive , and a couple of congressional contests in the @entity97 state will also attract national attention			2
" this trip is really about the 2014 election rather than about 2016 , " @entity99 , a longtime senior political adviser to @entity0 , told @entity25			2
he pointed to a fundraiser later this month in the nation 's capital that @entity0 is headlining for @entity105 , who 's challenging conservative @entity1 @entity106 rep. @entity106 next year , to highlight the vice president 's efforts to help elect fellow @entity8 in the midterms			1
while touting those efforts , @entity99 also conceded that " you can stop people from speculating			0
the vice president obviously has n't taken 2016 off the table and @entity1 's more than a little important			1
" the @entity5 announced on thursday that @entity0 will travel to the @entity115 in @entity36 to discuss jobs and infrastructure			2
@entity0 is also scheduled to visit the @entity118 , @entity119 , later that day			0
while the visit is an official vice presidential trip , @entity36 just happens to be another crucial early voting state , holding the first southern primary in the race for the @entity5			1
this will be @entity0 's second visit to the @entity36 this year			0
" you do n't want @entity128 to feel unloved , " joked @entity99			0
besides visits to the early voting states , another indicator of whether @entity0 may launch another presidential bid will be his decision on whether to set up a leadership pac			1
such a move could signal that he is taking more of an interest in setting up a possible campaign structure			0
a @entity139 political adviser , who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely , said that a leadership pac is " still being mulled over			0
" speaking before @entity0 at the steak fry will be @entity143 mayor @entity142 , who 's considered a rising young star in the party			2
@entity142 , who gave the keynote address at last year 's @entity8 convention , is also considered a possible 2016 contender			2
@entity0 wo n't be the first sitting vice president to speak at @entity7 's event			1
@entity152 news director @entity151 points out that vice president @entity153 was the main attraction at the 1995 and 1999 events , before running for president in the 2000 election .			2
