-- the @entity1 , that picture - perfect stretch of beach - hugging @entity4 coastline , looks just like a fabled playground of the rich - and - famous would if an artist drew it			1
and many of the most renowned , from @entity10 to @entity11 , certainly did			0
august is when many @entity1 residents escape their cities , towns and villages and head out " on holiday , " but weather-wise , it 's a great time to visit the @entity1 ( or the @entity1 , as the @entity1 is called en français )			2
but so is the fall , the spring -- even the so - called " off - season " after @entity20 's for those who prefer their crowds thin , traffic light and prices less steep			1
travel snapshots : share your photos from the @entity28 talk about an embarrassment of riches			1
from the @entity32 pastel charms of @entity33 and @entity34 to the sexy , sybaritic lure of @entity36 and @entity37 , the sun - splashed @entity28 has it all			1
here are 10 ways to savor it , no matter when you go			0
just like a supermodel blessed with natural beauty and great bones , the @entity1 loves to show itself off			0
so take advantage with anytime strolls through these gorgeous seaside and hillside cities and towns			0
@entity34 's famed @entity50 -- a miles - long stretch alongside pebbly beaches and dominated by the @entity54 - era landmark hotel @entity55 -- is one rewarding route ; the jaw - dropping allure of the walk between @entity1 villages @entity60 and next - door @entity61 is another			1
eight hotels worth a tour 2			0
party like a rock star			0
the @entity1 is a perennial playground for a-list celebrities such as @entity67 ( who in late july hit the streets of @entity37 in a bandeau bikini top and crochet skirt ) , @entity72 - winning actor @entity71 , @entity73 and @entity74			2
but you too can roll like the jet set			0
do it in @entity36 ( may 's annual film festival , anyone ? ) at @entity81 nightclub where @entity82 and @entity83 have dropped in			2
or at @entity37 's eternally hot and long - queued club @entity85 , where stars such as @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 and @entity90 get the royal treatment -- and guests staying onsite at the five - star @entity94 get to skip the lines			1
unlike the giant casinos in @entity100 , where gamblers amble in wearing shorts and flip - flops , the grand ones in @entity98 are more refined			1
even though men are " required " only to wear long pants and closed - toe shoes at the @entity114 , they can channel their inner @entity105 and don jackets at night in the @entity107 , where roulette , blackjack and other games are played			1
@entity116 ' massive @entity115 is one of several , including @entity34 's glitzy @entity118 , owned by the 100 - year - old @entity119 , which helped launch the modern - day resort concept by combining casinos , luxury hotels and sports facilities on the same site			1
both @entity118 and the casino inside the @entity127 - inspired @entity126 have fabulous addresses , facing the sea and the @entity50			1
the @entity28 is home to some amazing smells , thanks to the way - high hillside towns of @entity135 and @entity136 , which send fragrances to the world and explain perfume production to the masses			1
@entity135 , about 26 miles west of @entity34 , is home to legends @entity143 , whose 18th century factory is still open to the public ; @entity146 , which also operates a friendly and well - stocked store in central @entity34 ; and @entity148 , another 18th century gem that offers free guided tours of its factory and museum 365 days a year ( and does the same in picturesque @entity136 )			1
travel snapshots : @entity155 5			0
great painters were obviously onto something when they settled along the @entity1 , inspired by its dazzling blue waters and skies and villages high in the sky			0
those who called this stretch home and created world - class works that fill modern - day museums along the @entity1 include @entity168 , whose former château - turned - museum in @entity172 houses hundreds of his paintings , ceramics and more			1
in @entity34 , there 's @entity176 , perched on a hill in the tony @entity179 neighborhood and housing a collection the artist and his heirs left to the city			1
@entity185 features the 19th century artist 's biblical - themed works			1

of course , there 's the @entity202 with international @entity204 headliners each july ( and with many performances staged in an ancient @entity207 amphitheater in @entity179 )			0
the top - flight and @entity212 à @entity209 festival follows just days later in lively and watersports - friendly @entity213			0
@entity36 lights up the sky each summer with the annual @entity216 , which started last month and continues august 7 , 15 and 24			0
also catch the @entity217 each july and august , with its competition happening august 8 and 25			0
if you feel a need for speed , the @entity221 of @entity98 races through this tiny principality 's streets for several days each may			1
@entity225 : do 's and don'ts 7			0
cuisine in the @entity28 takes advantage of the @entity231 's rich natural bounty			1
you 'll find colorful ratatouille , a side dish made from tomatoes , eggplant , onions , peppers and zucchini ; bouillabaisse , the famed seafood soup from the port city of @entity243 served with a creamy garlic sauce ; and socca , a chickpea - and - olive oil pancake sold by vendors in @entity34 and beyond			1
and because @entity34 belonged to @entity250 until 1860 , @entity249 cuisine feels about as local as salad niçoise			1
you 'll dine fabulously across the @entity1 , but tiny @entity253 in @entity254 ( @entity252 ) @entity34 does more than serve delicious dishes			2
multilingual owner @entity256 uses his seasonal cuisine as a showcase for the small - producer @entity231 olive oils he sells			2
you 'll want to take home bottles of this liquid gold to use back home -- and give as gifts			0
the @entity1 may be all about sun - splashed days , but the good times keep rolling at night			0
the mild climate lets folks dine and sip aperitifs outdoors most of the year , with terrace tables at cafes and restaurants such as @entity60 's always - popular @entity274 and those along the town quai occupied even in cooler months			2
and from late june through early september , take in a current ( usually @entity279 ) film once the sun sets at the @entity282			0
talk about a stunning backdrop to the action -- the cinema 's perched on the @entity286 , overlooking the sea and with spectacular views of the @entity289 and @entity290			2
even @entity291 could n't stage a scene like this			0
choices abound when cooling your heels after long days and nights on the @entity1			0
high rollers choose the celeb - favored @entity299 at the southern tip of @entity172 or the @entity36 on the @entity303 waterfront promenade			0
if you 're looking for stunning sea views , balconies and a more laid - back artistic vibe , the 35 - room @entity307 in @entity60 is a great bet			2
( writer / artist / filmmaker @entity310 used to stay here , and painted the interior of the 14th century @entity313 across the street			0
) get more space by renting one of seven stylishly furnished flats ( three on the @entity60 waterfront , most of the others in the colorfully charming @entity290 ) from @entity322 , which offers personalized service and every home comfort you might need			0
no matter how you arrive or depart the @entity1 , you 'll be treated to world - class views			1
take the high - speed @entity328 to or from @entity155 or regional trains from nearby @entity330 , @entity250 , and gaze at mile after gorgeous mile of @entity4 beaches			1
fly into or out of @entity34 -- one of @entity335 's three busiest airports -- and drool at the scenery you 'll see from the air			1
since the @entity1 is home to the annual @entity221 , consider checking out the landscape on your own wheels , zipping along the three corniches , or winding roads that stretch between @entity34 and @entity33			2
