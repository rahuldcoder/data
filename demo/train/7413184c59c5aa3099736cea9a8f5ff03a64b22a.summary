@entity0 -- i am pleased and relieved that the court in @entity4 finally found in my favor this week in my case against @entity7			1
with hundreds of pages of court documents , mainly generated by @entity7 lawyers , you would have thought my case against them was complicated			1
the point is very simple			0
it concerns nine illegally acquired pictures which courts in the @entity18 and @entity19 have previously ruled should not be shown			1
if someone posts one of these pictures somewhere in the world , @entity7 's search engine will automatically find and display it			1
however @entity7 will take the picture and its link down whenever they are asked to do so			1
as they themselves say , they have done this many times for me and for others			0
the problem is that having removed a picture following receipt of notice from me , their search simply replaces the picture with another taken from a different webpage			2
the images , which i fought so hard to establish were illegal , continually reappear courtesy of @entity7			1
given that they are prepared to take a specific illegal picture down manually once it has been identified , why not do so automatically ? they have the software to recognize specific pictures			1
indeed they make the tool freely available on their homepage			0
so why not use it ? they know exactly which pictures are involved because we have repeatedly identified them			2
all i was asking was that , automatically rather than manually , they stop displaying these specific and known pictures and providing links to them			2
this seemed to me an obvious and simple request			0
it is what the @entity19 court has now ordered them to do			1
it also seemed to me to be in @entity7 's own interest			1
surely they would not want the trouble of dealing manually with endless take - down requests when they already had the software to identify specific images and could block them automatically			1
was this not exactly the sort of thing computers do and @entity7 are particularly good at ? it is very difficult to understand why @entity7 should fight tooth and nail to resist doing automatically something they are fully prepared to do manually			1
to begin with , @entity7 argued that they did n't have the software			1
then they said , ok , they could develop the software but there was some great principle involved in blocking a picture , notwithstanding that they must already do this for indecent images of children and other illegal images and information			1
then they said it might inadvertently block something legitimate -- obvious nonsense given that we are dealing with a small number of specific pictures			2
then they tried to mix this up with cases where a person wanted something objectionable removed without a court decision			2
then they suggested we were asking them to exercise judgment - again obvious nonsense given the court decisions that already existed about these specific pictures			1
finally , they claimed they were defending free speech			0
but it 's the courts which said the pictures were illegal and should not be shown , so the issue is the rule of law , not freedom of speech			1
i think that there is something seriously wrong with the culture at @entity7			1
the technical side is brilliant and extremely useful			0
there are some extraordinarily gifted people working on the technical side and coming up with ideas and then the software to exploit them			0
yet the non-technical management , particularly in the legal department , seems to be irrational to the point of becoming adolescent			0
it 's almost as if they refuse to do something entirely sensible , and which would save them and others time and trouble , for no better reason than that someone asked them to			0
in the end , it 's about obeying the law and having respect for the rule of law			0
there is absolutely nothing wrong with observing the law automatically , quite the reverse			2
there must be some rational people at the top of @entity7			2
you would expect them to respect the rights of the individual once established in a court of law			0
they should insist their legal department do the same			0
but you may be wondering why i decided to fight the case when it was obvious the primary result would be to draw attention to precisely those pictures i wanted to get rid of			0
first , unless the pictures are blocked automatically , i or my lawyers will have to monitor the web in perpetuity			0
second , the principle that an individual is able to rely on the rule of law to enforce his or her rights is , i think , of fundamental importance			0
this should apply no matter who is the opponent or what their business			0
i hope that this judgment helps establish that principle in respect of online publications and that it may be of use to others in the future			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity19 court orders search engine @entity7 to remove @entity199 orgy pictures
courts had previously ruled the images must not be shown
@entity199 : images he fought to establish were illegal , continually reappear on @entity7
i think there is something seriously wrong with the culture at @entity7 - @entity199
