-- @entity1 , 77 , is one of only four remaining original rebels led by @entity3 in the 1950s in @entity5			1
by @entity5 standards , he has had a remarkable career , serving the @entity3 brothers loyally for years in a variety of posts , some which made him notorious			2
now , @entity1 has accepted a new task outside @entity5 that is raising skepticism			2
he arrived this week in @entity15 as a consultant for that country 's energy crisis			1
@entity15 is facing critical electricity shortages that have created rolling blackouts in some areas			2
the government of @entity23 blames a long drought that has reduced energy production at the country 's main hydroelectric dam , while others say the real problem is a lack of investment in energy infrastructure			2
the issue has become a political one , but regardless of the reason for the electricity shortages , experts warn that @entity15 faces a complete electric collapse if something is n't done soon			2
that 's where @entity1 comes in , as well as the critics who have seized upon his biography			1
" his reputation is as a ruthless minister of interior , " said @entity43 , who wrote about @entity1 in her book " without @entity3 : a death foretold in @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51			1
" @entity1 has been with the @entity3 brothers from the beginning of the revolution and today is arguably the no. 3 man in the @entity5 hierarchy , she said			1
as interior minister , @entity1 oversaw secret police operations and gained a reputation for being ruthless when it came to suppressing dissidents			2
" he 's known for his willingness to do crackdowns , " @entity43 told @entity0			0
most recently , he has been in charge of the internet on the communist island			0
" he 's the one who makes sure most @entity5 do n't have access to the @entity63 , " @entity43 said			0
one thing @entity1 lacks , critics say , is experience in the energy sector			1
" for us engineers in @entity15 , it makes no sense , " @entity70 , president of @entity15 's @entity71 , told @entity0			1
there are plenty of qualified engineers in the country with the experience to fix the electricity shortfalls , he said			0
furthermore , @entity15 engineers are already familiar with the electric system and equipment in the country , he added			2
@entity23 has been under increased pressure lately because of the energy problem and other domestic quarrels , including the suspension of an opposition cable broadcaster -- ostensibly for not following broadcast laws			0
the move resulted in many days of protests and marches , organized in part online through social networking sites			0
in a televised speech , @entity23 went so far as to say that spreading criticism against the government through the @entity63 constitutes " terrorism			0
" so critics are eying the subsequent hiring of @entity5 's top @entity63 censor to help @entity23 in @entity15			1
" this man presumably came here to do things other than help us [ with the electricity problems ] , " @entity70 said			0
after all , @entity43 said , @entity1 is the man who has referred to the internet as a " wild colt " that must be tamed			0
but that may not the only explanation for @entity1 ' arrival , said @entity113 , professor of political science at the @entity115 in @entity116 , @entity15			1
while @entity1 may not be an energy man , he does have a background in government purchases , @entity113 told @entity0			1
@entity15 's alliance with @entity5 in areas such as medicine has resulted in a system in which @entity5 purchases medical equipment that it in turn sells to @entity15 at a markup , he said			1
@entity113 said it is possible that @entity1 is coming to do something similar with the energy sector			1
that is , assess what equipment @entity15 needs to meet its electricity needs and have the @entity5 team purchase it and then sell it to @entity15			0
the bottom line , he said , is that " president @entity23 's dependence on @entity5 is reaching unprecedented levels			0
" the @entity15 government said that the @entity5 team is simply one of several foreign teams that have been called to help			1
energy minister @entity140 cited teams from @entity142 and @entity143 that have already arrived , along with offers of help from @entity146 and @entity147			0
as for @entity1 and his team , " they have great expertise on matters of saving electricity and electrical efficiency , " the minister said , according to the state - run @entity150 news service			0
" they have realized extraordinary work in the replacement of a great quantity of very inefficient equipment , pushing forth an energy revolution where they changed all of the incandescent light bulbs for energy - saving bulbs			0
" the @entity5 also came up with an electrical grid that divides the country into rings , so that problems in one area wo n't affect other areas , @entity140 said			0
in all , the @entity15 government will invest more than $ 4 billion to fix the electricity problems , he said			2
calls to @entity15 authorities for further comment on the appointment of @entity1 were not immediately returned .			1

@entity1 , 77 , is one of only four remaining original rebels led by @entity3 in the 1950s
some worry about what @entity1 , who 's been called ruthless , will be up to in @entity15
he 's been hired to help end energy crisis , but critics say he lacks energy sector experience
but others say @entity1 , who has experience in government purchases , could help
