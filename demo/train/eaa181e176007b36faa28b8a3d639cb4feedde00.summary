-- the rest of the world is probably asking what 's in the drinking water here in @entity6 , where ex- gov. @entity7 , who resigned in 2008 when his hiring of hookers came to light , surprised everybody by announcing a bid for city comptroller			1
@entity7 , dubbed the @entity14 by the city 's tabloids , leaps back into the political arena less than two months after former rep. @entity18 ( who 'd resigned after texting obscene photos to strangers ) announced a run for mayor			1
which raises the admittedly uncomfortable possibility that the city 's top two elected officials will be two nationally - known , high - profile married politicians with less than honorable sex - related behavior on their resumes			2
but that 's as far as the similarities go			0
@entity7 and @entity18 have very different histories , committed fundamentally different offenses and will face dramatically different odds in the few weeks left before voters head to the polls in the all - important sept. 10 @entity40 primary			1
has the road to political redemption gotten shorter ? start with the crimes			0
@entity18 , whose scandalously bawdy texts and photos never involved actually physically meeting up with a woman , spent a week lying about the incidents on any number of local and national television outlets , claiming that his @entity51 account had been hacked			2
that , in turn , led to calls for an @entity56 inquiry , after which @entity18 's tower of lies collapsed			2
@entity7 , by contrast , simply admitted that he 'd hired hookers , apologized for his misbehavior and quit			0
he now campaigns without the baggage , which @entity18 still carries , of having lied to the public and press repeatedly			1
when it comes to the record each man brings to the campaign trail , it 's not even a close call			0
in more than eight years as state attorney general and 14 months as governor , @entity7 compiled a string of high - profile wins in battles with @entity76 and prosecutions on behalf of low - paid workers			1
he also implemented a historic increase of state funding to local school districts and appointed the state 's first @entity83 secretary of state			0
@entity7 seeks return to politics -- as @entity6 comptroller @entity18 's tenure in @entity89 was notably skimpy on tangible wins			1
a recent @entity92 story noted that , over a 12 - year career , @entity18 wrote exactly one bill that got enacted			2
he was a visible , effective voice on key issues , but not the kind of politician who immersed himself in the machinery of government or coalition - building			0
but the biggest distinction between the two men , and the most politically relevant , involves their respective paths to victory			0
@entity18 , running in a crowded 6 - candidate race , is leading in the polls and , under @entity6 rules , could get into a @entity40 runoff pitting him against one of his rivals			1
he is currently grinding his way through a seemingly endless series of public forums and debates			0
by @entity7 leaps into an all - but - empty race for comptroller that had been largely conceded to @entity120 , a longtime political insider who 'd spent two decades in the legislature and eight in the relatively powerless position of borough president of @entity125			1
@entity7 , who is funding his campaign using his family 's personal fortune , hopes to use his money , celebrity and impressive record to blow past his opponent to victory			2
polls suggest that about 40 % of @entity6 think @entity18 's offenses disqualify him from office altogether ; a comparable number may think the same of @entity7			1
that leaves plenty of room for our city 's famously tolerant population to decide if they can , or should , elect a pair of soiled , but talented , politicians to run the nation 's largest city			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity151 : @entity7 making new bid for @entity6 comptroller ; he joins @entity18 in arena
both had sex scandals , but similarities end there . @entity7 *fessed* up in his scandal
but @entity18 lied , he says . @entity7 has record of *accomplishment* . @entity18 not so much
louis : @entity18 in 6 - candidate race . @entity7 faces 1 oppenent . can @entity168 *forgive* ?
