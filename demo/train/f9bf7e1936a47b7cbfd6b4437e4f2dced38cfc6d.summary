@entity0 , @entity1 -- november 28th last year passed pretty quietly here			1
but in some ways it was more significant a date than today			0
that was when , by my calculations , @entity8 - led coalition troops had been in @entity1 longer than the @entity11 was			1
today , they 've been here 10 years			0
that 's almost impossible to contemplate			2
the time has drifted by , measured more in sacrifice and expenditure : the numbers of young soldiers who risked a lot to join the military and wo n't be going home			0
the immeasurable amount of money spent here , on roads that will be hard to maintain once the coalition leaves , on homes in @entity28 for @entity1 officials who should have known better			1
@entity31 calculations suggest the money spent on war each month here could alternatively be given straight to @entity1 -- hundreds of dollars each a month			1
that would have been something in 2001 , but now the huge inflation of war makes it comparative small change			0
general @entity40 , the former top @entity8 commander in @entity1 , said thursday the coalition is only 50 per cent of the way there			1
it is likely @entity40 , who lost his job after he and his team were quoted extensively in @entity48 magazine , will be remembered as the great truth - teller of the war that ended his military career			0
for a little while , his bluntly pessimistic assessments felt like there was someone in charge who knew how bad and how complicated it was , and how long the road ahead would be			0
as one of @entity40 's top aides , maj. gen @entity61 , told @entity48 in that same article : " it 's not going to look like a win , smell like a win or taste like a win			0
" but after @entity40 's hasty departure , the war seemed to revert to crisis management again			0
his replacement as commander of @entity8 and @entity73 troops in @entity1 , general @entity69 had little time in the job before the collapse in domestic support -- dare i even say comprehension -- of the war led @entity80 to begin thinking about the exit			1
it has been curious to see @entity80 , the presidential candidate who seemed to understand the importance of leaving this country in a manageable state , become the drum beater for an exit			0
the war is not a vote - winner after @entity91 's death , and there 's simply no money left in the kitty			2
some things are better : there 's money everywhere here ; there 's better healthcare in some places ; there 's technology the @entity104 held at bay ; there are hospitals and schools where before there were none			1
but it 's not a proper democracy ; it 's not safe ; the vast majority of people here are still poor and illiterate ; and it 's still got the @entity104 , @entity117 and a lot of narco - traffickers in play			1
now the timetable is set , the battle of perception , as @entity123 called it , being fought with one unmistakable backdrop : the @entity8 want out			2
the @entity123 message is being persistently and deftly put out there : we are making security good enough for the @entity1 to handle			2
you hear that message , come hell or high water , almost independent of what 's happening on the ground			0
it 's easy to understand why : it may be there 's not much more @entity8 can do here , bar stay another 10 years .			1

@entity8 - led coalition troops have been in @entity1 longer than the @entity11 was
the vast majority of people in @entity1 are still poor and illiterate
there 's better healthcare and technology , but still no proper democracy
