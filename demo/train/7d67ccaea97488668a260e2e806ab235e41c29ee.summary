-- he does n't have an agent			1
he does n't have a publicist			1
he does n't even seem to have a fixed address			1
yet , in by - the - numbers @entity6 , @entity5 has turned his unpredictability into an asset			1
want to get hold of him ? call his 800 number			1
maybe he 'll get back to you			1
( maybe he wo n't			1
in fact , he probably wo n't			1
) you almost certainly wo n't find him among the glitterati in @entity16 , but if you 're at a @entity17 , @entity18 , birthday party ; or a house party in @entity21 ; or the @entity23 airport , you might run into the star			1
indeed , there 's an entire website devoted to " @entity5 stories			1
" such is his impish image that it 's subtitled -- after an alleged @entity5 quote -- " no one will ever believe you			1
" ( there 's a @entity32 , too			2
) " if his three and a half decades in the public sphere have taught us anything about the actor , it 's that he simply does not give a good goddamn , " wrote @entity34 's @entity33 in a 2010 interview			1
does n't he know better ? does n't he realize he should dress in fashionable clothes and not shorts and @entity44 shirts ? does n't he realize that he 's supposed to glide around in limos and @entity46 ? does n't he realize he 's a celebrity , dammit , and celebrities are supposed to be -- arrogant sniff -- special ? here are more than five reasons why he 's the greatest star going : he does the movies he wants to do			1
some movie stars will do anything for a paycheck			2
others , like @entity55 , have a code of sorts : " one ( low - budget indie ) for me , one ( big - budget blockbuster ) for them			1
" @entity5 's code is : i 'll do whatever the hell i want			1
his new film , " @entity65 , " lives up to the @entity5 ethos			1
it 's an indie film with a rookie writer / director , @entity68			1
@entity5 took the role almost casually after @entity68 , a neophyte , left a series of increasingly urgent messages for the performer			1
his role ? a crusty old man -- a stroke victim -- who befriends a young boy			1
there 's no rhyme or reason to what makes a @entity5 movie			1
he 's become a part of @entity85 's troupe , appearing in " @entity86 , " " @entity87 , " " @entity88 " and " @entity89 with @entity89 " in roles large and small			2
he made an awards bid , playing @entity92 in " @entity93 on @entity94 , " and took a small part in an attempted blockbuster , the big - screen version of " @entity98			1
" it 's nothing new for @entity5 -- in the early ' 80s , he was uncredited in " @entity100 , " made the biggest comedy of all time in " ghostbusters " and then turned to a pet project , " @entity105			1
" he 's never looked back			2
" i think we 're all sort of imprisoned by -- or at least bound to -- the choices we make , and i think everyone in the acting business wants to make the right choices , " he told @entity109 in 2012			2
" you want to say no at the right time and you want to say yes more sparingly			2
" he works more than people think			2
it feels like @entity5 goes years between movies -- and , once upon a time , he did			1
except for a small but nice turn in 1986 's " @entity120 , " @entity5 went four years between " @entity105 " and " @entity122 " -- he used the downtime to study at the @entity124 -- and he made just a handful of films during the early and mid ' 90s			1
" i 've retired a couple of times			2
it 's great , because you can just say , ' oh , i 'm sorry			2
i 'm retired , ' " he told @entity34 's @entity33			2
" and people will actually believe that you 've retired			2
there are nutters out there that will go , ' oh , ok ! ' and then leave you alone			2
" but since 1998 's " @entity136 " and " @entity86 , " there 's been plenty of @entity5 , including nine projects in 2014 - 15 alone , according to the @entity140			1
he wo n't be pressured into " @entity141			2
" or any comedy , actually			2
will @entity5 pop up in the new " ghostbusters , " now being helmed by @entity144 and starring a number of comic actresses ? who knows ? in 2010 he was adamant that he was n't going to do it for the ( presumably substantial ) money			1
" it 's the studio that really wants this thing			2
it 's a franchise , and they made a whole lot of money on ' ghostbusters , ' " he told @entity33			1
and he 's not so keen on a straight comedy , either			2
" i think there 's something that i can bring to a comedy today , but i do n't know where to bring it , " he said in 2012			2
" i know that if i ever feel that i need to make a funny movie , i 'll figure out how to write one			2
i 'll get it done			2
if i ever get some ambition , i 'm gon na get some s * * * done			0
" he may look nonchalant , but he takes acting seriously			0
perhaps @entity5 's most important teacher was improv great @entity171 , with whom he worked at @entity173 's @entity172			1
" he taught people to commit , " he told @entity109			0
" like : ' do n't walk out there with one hand in your pocket unless there 's somethin ' in there you 're going to bring out			0
' you got ta commit			0
you 've got ta go out there and improvise and you 've got ta be completely unafraid to die			0
you 've got to be able to take a chance to die			0
and you have to die lots			0
you have to die all the time			0
" and he thought he was going to win an @entity186 for " @entity187 , " which earned him his only @entity186 nomination			0
" the one time i got a bunch of prizes , i just assumed i 'd win them all , " he told @entity34			0
" because i 'd been winning them all			0
i was n't disappointed or anything , but i was surprised			0
" he 's from a big family and he has a big family			0
@entity5 is the fifth child of nine			1
a number of his siblings are also in show business , including former " snl " writer and cast member @entity201 , " @entity204 " actor @entity203 and actor - writer @entity205			1
( a sister , @entity206 , is a @entity207 nun but also acts ; she put on a one - woman show about @entity209			0
) he 's also a father to a brood of six with two wives , and he takes fatherhood seriously -- and cheekily			0
while preparing for dinner during the @entity109 interview , he told his then 10 - year - old son , @entity215 , " you 're going to have to get dressed nicely			0
and you need a shower			0
" his son responded , " yes , sir			0
" he also accompanied son @entity221 to a 2013 @entity223 game in @entity223 , which @entity221 attends			0
as a witness reported on @entity231 , " as i approached i noticed a young college girl covered in @entity226 attire walk over to @entity5 and hand him an @entity227 themed football asking if he would sign it			1
@entity5 took the football from her , said " @entity237 " , punted the football over the road into a big group of bushes , and ran off			1
it was single - handedly the funniest thing i have ever witnessed ! " he likes hanging out with you			0
( well , maybe not you personally , but non-celebrity types			0
) the " @entity243 , " as friend @entity244 calls him , is n't much for security			0
he told @entity246 ' @entity245 that he generally trusts the public : " most people are fine , " he said			0
the security was n't worth it psychologically			0
" from the first time i was ever given a bodyguard , i thought , ' @entity253 , i 'm going to be assassinated			0
' it made me think i was going to be shot			1
so i never liked it			0
i never liked the sensation of it , " he told @entity245			0
but the 800 number ? that exists for a reason			0
" when the phone started ringing too many times , i had to take it back to what i can handle			0
i take my chances on a job or a person as opposed to a situation , " he told @entity109			0
@entity244 is often his intermediary -- and , famously , the butt of one of @entity5 's favorite jokes			1
@entity244 is married to actress @entity273 , and when @entity5 sees @entity273 's film " @entity274 " on tv , he 'll call @entity244 when the @entity273 - @entity277 sex scene comes on			1
" @entity5 once called him from @entity279 , " @entity273 told the @entity278			1
and then there 's ... well , you know			0
several more reasons why we love @entity5 : he crashed an engagement photo shoot			1
he did karaoke with complete strangers			0
he was busted for an allegedly drunken ride ... in a golf cart			0
regardless of what you ordered , you could only get tequila			0
he read poetry to construction workers			0
perhaps his old friend and " @entity297 " director , @entity296 , put it best			0
@entity5 is " all the @entity299 rolled into one : he 's got the wit of @entity301 , the pantomimic brilliance and lasciviousness of @entity304 , and the @entity306 quality of @entity307			1
" do n't ever change , @entity308 .			0

@entity5 has made a career out of unpredictability
actor has crashed photos , popped up in surprising places
his movies run the gamut from indie to blockbuster
newest is " @entity65 , " in which he plays old man recovering from stroke
