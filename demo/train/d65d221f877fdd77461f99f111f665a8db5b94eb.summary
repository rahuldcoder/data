@entity0 -- a federal judge has approved a $ 41 million civil rights settlement to five black and @entity6 men wrongfully convicted in the horrific beating and rape of a white female jogger in @entity0 's @entity10 in 1989 , mayor @entity2 said in a statement friday			1
the sensational case polarized the city along racial lines and became emblematic of a state of rampant crime			1
five minority teenagers , who became known as the @entity18 , were coerced amid public uproar into making incriminating statements and convicted in 1990			2
" this settlement is an act of justice for those five men that is long overdue , " @entity2 said in the statement			2
" we can finally put this case behind us , and these five men and their families can begin to heal these wounds and move forward			1
" the agreement between the city law department and the five men -- who served between seven and 13 years in prison -- averaged about $ 1 million per year of incarceration , was reached in june			1
one of the men , @entity38 , served 13 years in prison			1
@entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 each served about seven years			1
the approval of a federal judge in @entity46 in @entity47 , where the men filed their civil rights lawsuit , was the final step for the settlement to take effect			2
on april 19 , 1989 , a 28 - year - old @entity54 investment banker jogging through @entity10 was raped , viciously beaten and left for dead			2
she would have no memory of the attack			0
that same night , a group of black and @entity59 boys had been in the park , throwing rocks at cars and assaulting people in a practice the media and law enforcement at the time called " wilding			0
" an investigation led to the arrest of five teens who were accused of rampaging through the park in a " wolf pack " and preying on innocent victims			0
they were charged and convicted			0
the victim , @entity42 , kept her identity hidden for 14 years until the publication of her book , " i am the @entity42			0
" three of the convicted young men had finished their prison terms , one was on parole and the fifth was in jail on an unrelated offense when @entity42 , a serial rapist and murderer in 2002 confessed to the crime and said he had acted alone			1
dna analysis later determined that @entity92 did rape the jogger and that hair evidence used in the boys ' trials did not match			0
@entity97 , the @entity47 district attorney at the time , ordered a new investigation and , on his recommendation , a judge vacated the convictions			0
" to the extent that the evidence suggests that these five young men were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to substantial prison terms for a crime they did not commit , that in and of itself constitutes an injustice in need of redress , " corporation counsel @entity102 said in a statement friday			1
but @entity102 said the settlement " should not be construed as an acknowledgment that the convictions ... were the result of law enforcement misconduct			0
" " on the contrary , our review of the record suggests that both the investigating detectives and the assistant district attorneys involved in the case acted reasonably , given the circumstances with which they were confronted , " he said			2
" in the end , however , that is an issue that would ultimately be determined by a jury at trial , absent a settlement of this litigation			0
we have determined that a resolution of this matter is in the best interests of the @entity137			0
" three exonerated in @entity10 jogger case thank supporters			1
