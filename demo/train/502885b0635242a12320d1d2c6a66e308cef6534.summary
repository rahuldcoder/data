-- @entity2 manager @entity1 confirmed on tuesday that @entity3 wants to leave the @entity5 club in a series of interviews aimed at ending speculation over the soccer star 's future			1
" we can not quite understand why he would want to leave , " @entity1 told reporters , revealing he had first known in august that @entity3 would not sign a new contract			1
" we do n't understand it			2
i ca n't answer any questions about why he is doing it			2
it wo n't matter a dickie - bird , simply because the player is adamant he wants to leave			0
we have to deal with the next part of that , which we will do , as best we can , in relation to this request			2
" i can do no more than i have said at the moment because we still , to my mind , have the door open			0
" has @entity3 made the right decision ? rumors had been building that the striker had refused to extend his @entity2 deal -- which expires in mid- 2012 -- following an apparent rift with @entity1 , with the player having publicly contradicted the @entity37 in statements about his fitness			1
@entity1 has rarely selected @entity3 in his starting line - up since newspaper reports emerged last month with claims about alleged marital infidelities , at first saying he was protecting the player and then that he had an ankle injury			1
@entity49 anchor @entity48 ' @entity47 feed but the 24 - year - old last week said he has had no fitness problems this season after returning to action in @entity55 's @entity54 qualifier against @entity56 , sparking widespread reports that he was unhappy with @entity1			1
" why he was saying he was n't injured , you can only guess yourself			0
it 's disappointing , " @entity1 told the @entity2 website on tuesday			1
" we 've never had any argument , not a bit			0
i think you have to understand the mechanics of these situations when people want to leave the club			0
it 's an easy one to say he 's fallen out with the manager , a very easy one to say			1
" @entity1 said @entity2 chief executive @entity73 had begun new contract negotiations with @entity3 before the @entity75 started in june			1
" @entity73 , in the early part of the summer , had opened talks with his agent			0
and that was to be continued after the @entity75 , " @entity1 said			1
" i was in the office on august 14 when @entity73 told me he 'd had a call from his agent saying that @entity3 was n't going to sign his contract			1
so then @entity73 came across to see me			0
he said he could n't believe it and neither could i. " i was dumbfounded , i could n't understand it at all because only months before he 'd said he was at the biggest club in the world and he wanted to stay for life			0
we just do n't know what 's changed the boy 's mind			0
@entity73 was shocked , i was shocked			0
" i had a meeting with the boy and he reiterated what his agent had said			0
i said to him , ' just remember one thing : respect this club			0
i do n't want any nonsense from you , respect your club			0
' " what we 're seeing now in the media is disappointing because we 've done everything we can for @entity3 , since the minute he 's come to the club			1
we 've always been there as a harbor for him			0
any time he 's been in trouble , the advice we 've given him -- i 've even been prepared to give him financial advice , many times			0
" no january signings , say @entity116 @entity1 opted to rest @entity3 for the match against his former club @entity118 in the light of newspaper allegations that the player had slept with prostitutes			1
@entity3 then played in the @entity124 clash with @entity126 club @entity125 , but came off with an injury			1
" he got an ankle injury in the @entity125 game			0
he was seen clearly hobbling at halftime			0
he confirmed it himself in an interview with @entity136 , " @entity1 told reporters at another press conference			1
" my idea , based on the fact he was n't playing that well , was to leave him out of the @entity142 game , make sure his ankle is properly prepared for the next game , and give him a 10 - day recovery so he could play for @entity55			1
" @entity1 said he decided to clear the air by talking publicly because the situation was affecting @entity2 's on - field performances , most recently dropping points against promoted @entity151 on saturday			1
@entity153 gifts @entity151 a point " there 's been no falling out			0
that 's why we need to clarify the situation now for our fans			2
because what we saw on saturday was unacceptable			0
when we were at 2 - 2 and the fans were chanting for @entity3 , it put pressure on the players and it did n't do any good for the team			2
" so we 've got to clarify the situation and try to do it right			2
there 's no [ specific ] offer on the table for @entity3 [ at the moment ]			1
@entity73 's prepared to offer the best terms possible for any player in the country			2
we realize and recognize the quality of the player , that 's why negotiations were started early summer , two years before his contract was up , to extend that contract			2
and also extend at the behest of the player itself			0
" he said he wanted to stay for life			0
we were honoring that request from @entity3 to stay at the club , at the club he loved			2
he said the best thing he 'd ever done was to sign for @entity2			1
" so @entity73 was prepared , with the discussions with our owners , to offer @entity3 the best contract that anyone could have in the country			1
" meanwhile , @entity3 has been ruled out of wednesday 's home @entity124 clash with @entity197 club @entity196 after suffering another ankle injury in training			2
he was stretchered off the pitch in the morning session , meaning he joins veteran @entity202 , defender @entity203 and striker @entity204 on the sidelines			2
@entity2 's website said the extent of @entity3 's injury was not yet known .			1
