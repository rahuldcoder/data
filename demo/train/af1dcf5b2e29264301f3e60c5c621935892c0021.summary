-- as he rolls across the wheat fields of his @entity5 farm , @entity1 often has his hands not on the wheel of his tractor , but on a smartphone			1
@entity1 , a twittering farmer , pauses in front of his tractor in @entity5			1
he sometimes posts a dozen messages per day on @entity14 , commenting on everything from the weather to the state of his crops to his son 's first tractor ride and even last night 's cheeseburger			1
" got rained out trying to finish up planting corn			0
maybe it will dry up today and i can finish lord willin ' , " he wrote in one recent post			0
" just sold some more wheat , now , i wait for @entity31 to provide the harvest so i can fill the contracts , " the 39 - year - old said in another			2
" eat more bread ! " @entity35 is proof that smartphones are starting to put down roots in rural @entity38			1
he lives in a 150 - person town near @entity40 , @entity5 -- a place even he calls " the middle of nowhere			1
" the nearest neighbor to his 4,000 - acre farm is about 2 miles away			2
yet , farmers like @entity35 are using @entity46 - enabled phones to gain a foothold on online social networks -- both for business and personal reasons			1
( follow him on @entity14 ) " i can be in the most remote place and just with the power of having a @entity54 ... i can communicate with anybody at anytime about anything , " he said			1
" it is just amazing			0
" the growth of smartphones on farms is important because many people do n't think about where their food comes from , much less associate a specific farmer with that process , said @entity66 , a farmer and agricultural extension educator at @entity68			1
" when you can put a name or personality with someone who 's actually raising corn and soybeans or actually milking cows , that 's the most important thing that 's come about in my opinion , " he said			0
a host of blogs and @entity14 feeds have popped up around the subjects of technology and life on the farm			1
on tuesdays from 8 to 10 p.m. et , farmers meet on @entity14 for a live chat about all things agricultural			1
you can watch that conversation by searching for agchat on the site			0
@entity66 said he uses a smartphone to check live weather reports , which can make or break a year 's crop			1
other farmers send him pictures of ailing plants , hoping to identify crop diseases early			2
some farmers use their phones as notepads , tracking their applications of pesticides , he said			1
developers of phone applications apparently have taken notice of the farm - tech trend , too			2
an @entity109 application called @entity110 helps techie farmers in drought - stricken places monitor how much water is in their soil at various locations and in real time			1
historically , farms have lagged behind the rest of country in @entity46 and computer usage			1
but a 2007 census by the @entity38 @entity122 says web use on farms is increasing			2
high - speed internet access doubled on @entity38 farms between 2005 and 2007 , for instance , jumping from 13 percent to 27 percent			1
that 's still less than the general population , however			0
fifty - five percent of farms had internet access in 2007 compared with 62 percent of homes in the @entity38 overall , according to government statistics			1
the census does not measure smartphone penetration			0
internet - enabled phones are making their way into rural @entity38 slowly because it 's difficult to send @entity46 data over cellular networks in some sparsely populated areas where wireless service is spotty , some advocates have claimed			1
still , some farmers are adopting the technology despite the odds			2
the biggest draw of smartphones and online social networks is that they provide human connections to people for whom farm life can be lonely , said @entity152 , publisher of an agriculture news blog called agwired.com			1
" most farmers are going to be in their [ tractor ] cab , " he said			2
" you 're going all day long , night and day -- it can get a little bit boring , you know ? so , a lot of them have satellite radio , smartphones , iphones , @entity54			0
i ca n't tell you how many farmers are following me who are tweeting form the cab			0
" it 's a misconception that farmers are behind the curve technologically , @entity152 said			0
" in large part , farmers tend to be very early adopters of technology			0
we have the stereotypical image of a hayseed farmer that still persists -- out on a tractor with a straw hat on , " he said			0
" the reality is that most of them are very highly trained from a technological standpoint			0
" @entity35 said his job on the farm in @entity5 includes more than harvesting wheat , corn , sunflowers and millet			2
he wants to bring urban internet users along for the ride			0
and in doing so , he 's become a sort of text - happy evangelist for rural @entity38			2
" people out in the cities are n't familiar with agriculture like it used to be 100 years ago			0
they may not have an appreciation or an understanding of what goes on out in the rural side of things , " he said			0
" i just try to be an information source for whoever may be listening			0
" so that 's what he does from his tractor -- one tweet at a time .			0

smartphones and online social networks are gaining popularity on farms

@entity5 farmer says his @entity14 posts help bridge the urban - rural divide
