-- the death of a @entity3 luge athlete friday ahead of the opening of the @entity5 occurred amid concerns about the speed of the record - setting track at the @entity9 , according to a @entity3 official			1
" there were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident , " said @entity11 , @entity3 's deputy minister for culture and sports , adding that there had been several crashes in the same area			1
" but at this moment it would be premature for me to jump to any conclusions			0
" @entity22 , 21 , was on his final official training run when he had a " serious crash " near the end of the 4,500 - foot - long course and was propelled off the track , according to the @entity28			1
video of the crash shows @entity22 lying motionless after being thrown from his sled and striking a steel pole as he was coming out of the course 's last turn			1
he was given cpr by medical staff on site before being transported to a hospital where doctors were unable to revive him , the @entity28 said			0
luge death shows danger of fast tracks @entity22 was scheduled to compete in the men 's singles luge event , which begins saturday			1
the official training session was being held just hours before the opening ceremony for the @entity48			1
an investigation into the cause of the crash is under way , the @entity28 said , and the track was closed after the accident , @entity11 said			2
he urged a thorough examination " to prevent devastating events in the future			0
" the luge is often called the " fastest sport on ice			2
" sliders use their legs and shoulders to steer small fiberglass sleds down an icy track , at times approaching or surpassing speeds of 90 mph , according to the @entity5 web site			2
they are positioned on their backs with their feet straight out in front of them and their heads back to be as aerodynamic as possible			0
@entity77 's @entity76 , who is covering the @entity78 for the magazine , told @entity0 's " @entity82 " that the @entity9 course is the fastest in the world " and not by a little			2
" he noted that while most luge courses " flatten out " around the 11th turn , the @entity9 track " just keeps on dropping , so there 's really kind of no break from gathering speed toward the end			1
" @entity90 said some athletes had been complaining about the speed of the course and speculating that this @entity48 could be the first time the sport sees a competitor hit 100 mph			2
" that 's 15 to 20 mph faster than any course in the rest of the world , " @entity90 said			0
a track speed record -- and world speed record -- was recorded at @entity9 on february 21 , 2009 , when a single men 's luge athlete topped 95 mph during competition			1
@entity107 luger @entity106 held the previous world speed record of 86.8 mph set in 2001			0
@entity22 was traveling at 88 mph at the time of his crash , @entity90 said			2
@entity106 said friday that he had had problems in the lower portion of the track during one of his training runs			0
" because of the physics of the curves , and going at 95 mph , there 's a really small margin for error , " @entity106 said			0
" you really need to get it right from curve nine to get as far as curve 13 , because once you get to curve 11 and 12 , you 're going too fast to correct yourself			0
" @entity22 crashed on the 16th and final turn of the course			2
@entity28 president @entity128 declined to comment friday on what safety precautions may be put into place pending the outcome of the investigation			0
