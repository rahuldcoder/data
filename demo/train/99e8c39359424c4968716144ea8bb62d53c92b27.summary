for many college students , landing a coveted internship is a feat. but making the most of the internship is the real accomplishment			1
with countless internship stories -- both dream scenarios and nightmares -- making the news lately , @entity6 chatted with interns past and present to find out what made their experiences so great			1
free food galore , tantalizing perks and pay were definitely touted , but many students say these benefits are not the keys to a great internship			1
" the best internship i ever had was in the district office for congresswoman @entity25 , " says former intern @entity22			1
" while the internship was unpaid , the experience was priceless			1
i met many local political figures ... and many lifelong friends in the office			0
" so what 's the secret ? we got the skinny from interns past and present who say it 's all in what you make of it			1
here are five must - dos for a dynamite internship : 1			1
do n't get caught up on money @entity43 , a rising senior at @entity44 , interned with @entity45 -- for no pay -- this past spring			1
she 's working now as a restaurant hostess to save money for the school year			1
she says writing for the @entity51 blog and coordinating guest segments in the " @entity55 " studio outweighed the pay issue			0
" it never really made me mad because i loved it , " she says			0
" when you 're working somewhere like that , it validates you , so you almost ca n't get mad at them			1
" @entity43 received some financial assistance , including reimbursement for transportation , from @entity44 to make her internship possible			1
other interns also appeal to their schools for help making unpaid internships possible			0
while interning with @entity71 , a social entrepreneur think tank in @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity70 received a grant from her school 's honors program -- and she says it 's a situation with which many of her fellow interns can sympathize			1
" i 'm not spending money left and right , " she says			0
" all the interns bring their lunches			0
" other students turned to part - time jobs			0
@entity22 had a morning job as a bank teller for the duration of her internship , and she coordinated her schedule with the bank and the congresswoman 's office to make sure she could manage both commitments			1
when students are interning with start - ups or small companies , sometimes the employer just ca n't afford to pay extra hands			1
@entity102 , now a campus coordinator at @entity104 , interned with event planning group @entity105 last summer			0
she was unpaid , but her employer covered all project expenses			0
when @entity105 merged with another company in the fall , they had the money to pay -- and they hired @entity102 back as a paid intern			2
" internships have become the new entry level , " says @entity113 , associate director for employer relations and recruiting at @entity116			0
" employers like to know you can hit the ground running			0
embrace program structure no student relishes the stereotypical picture of " intern busy work " : sorting files , entering data -- feel free to insert your most dreaded office task here			1
in a structured internship program , there 's considerably less room for busy work or ( even worse ) dead time			1
interns ' schedules are instead packed with meetings , events or seminars			0
@entity70 , a rising junior at @entity141 in @entity142 , is interning this summer with @entity71 , a social entrepreneur think tank in @entity74 , @entity75			0
" i would say there 's just enough structure , " she says , specifically mentioning how weekly intern meetings can be educational seminars one week and informal socials the next			2
graduate student @entity149 is the only intern in the production department of @entity152 's " @entity151 , " so he says he appreciates participating in activities with other @entity152 interns , such as the lunchtime " @entity156			2
" after socializing and enjoying the free event , he returns to his department , where he collaborates with salaried team members " just like at a real job , " he says			0
find your role and claim ownership of your projects the word " ownership " pops up again and again when students describe internship successes			2
@entity169 says this is what separates good internships from great internships			1
as a @entity177 global sales operations intern , the majority of his time is spent collaborating with other interns on " meaty " projects and discussing his work with top leadership at the company			2
@entity183 is at @entity184 for his second summer because he says he feels encouraged to pitch ideas and network with upper management			0
he 's also seen his ideas successfully implemented later -- and he gets credit , too			1
" it is a high - paying internship , but the responsibility is the most rewarding part of it , " he says			2
" i just led a conference call with a couple vps on the phone			0
they let me do that			0
" but it 's not just tech companies that value collaboration with interns			2
at @entity204 , @entity149 says he has unlocked the secret to internship happiness : knowing your work has value			1
" it 's not , ' hey , intern , go get coffee , ' or ' watch me do this , ' " he says			2
" i have a very specific place , and it feels like a real job			0
" @entity216 founded the website @entity218 to match students with good internship experiences			1
she says identifying your role is critical when later discussing an internship experience in job interviews or within a cover letter			2
" if you ca n't say why your company is doing what it 's doing , you do n't know anything about the culture or the company , " she says			1
" you need to know the bigger picture of where your work fits in			2
bond with your supervisor at @entity71 , @entity70 says she does n't have an " intern supervisor " -- she has an " accountability partner , " a full - time employee also in her field			1
" you 're a partner , not just a lowly intern , " she says			0
@entity239 regularly meets with her accountability partner to give project updates , ask for advice on problems or learn about other opportunities within the company			0
but the best supervisors do n't just lead -- they also inspire			1
when interning for rep. @entity25 , @entity247 , in 2010 , @entity22 took particular notice of the congresswoman 's condolence card routine			2
@entity25 sent personalized cards to the families and friends of recently passed @entity254 in her district			0
" working in the office made me realize mailing some things puts a smile on people 's faces , whether you realize it or not , " @entity22 says			2
@entity22 is now pursuing a master 's degree in public administration -- a decision she says was inspired by her experience working with the congresswoman			1
" seeing her really care for her constituents made me think , ' i want to be like that			0
i want to be her , ' " she says			0
leave with talking points for your next job interview a stacked resume is n't only good for netting internships ; it should ideally highlight those experiences to lure full - time employers			1
@entity102 did exactly that after @entity105			0
she parlayed her experience planning parties and coordinating events into a career as a campus coordinator at her alma mater , @entity104			0
there , she draws from her internship experience on a daily basis			2
" my internship was a major thing i was asked about on job interviews , " she says			2
@entity292 says she frequently referenced her hands - on experience , while @entity22 says her internship was " a conversation starter " on her resume			2
@entity298 of @entity299 recommends keeping a list of tasks completed			1
" it not only makes you feel accomplished , it helps you build your resume , " she says			0
" and on that list , i would pinpoint about two to three things you 've learned personally as well as professionally			0
" @entity216 says above all else , students should remember internships are temporary -- they provide a chance to experiment with different responsibilities and work environments			1
" a great internship is an exploration of what you do n't want to do , " she says			1
and once you know what you want to do , use the internship experience to jumpstart your next career move			0
