@entity0 -- convicted @entity0 gangster @entity2 displayed no emotion wednesday as he heard one final time from the wives , brothers , sisters , sons and daughters of the people he killed , and those of others who were shot , stabbed or strangled by accomplices in the treacherous @entity14			1
@entity2 , 84 , who faces life in prison at his sentencing thursday morning , declined to address the court or the families			1
he did not make eye contact with them			2
during a final chapter in the life of a mobster whose rise and fall were as convoluted as any @entity29 script , the families of his victims described @entity2 variously as a coward , a rat and even @entity32 in the emotional first day of his sentencing hearing			1
@entity37 , fighting back tears and gasping for breath , struggled to address the court			2
his wife stepped up to help him utter the words that he said he had been holding inside for three decades			0
the judge asked him to take his time			0
" this man has built up so much hate in my heart , i 'd like to strangle him myself , " said @entity37 , whose sister @entity43 was allegedly strangled by @entity2 , her remains exhumed from a shallow grave			1
@entity49 was the girlfriend of @entity2 's partner , @entity37 " @entity51 , who testified that @entity2 killed her			1
the jury did not convict @entity2 of the slaying			1
" this son of b --- - should look every one of his victims in the eye when they speak , " he said			1
" you piece of s --- , look at me ! " @entity2 looked up at the front of the courtroom , raising his hand from a pad he scribbled on and began to turn slowly			1
he shot a brief glance at the podium but then turned to look at the judge			0
@entity37 , weeping , did not notice			0
@entity2 was convicted of racketeering , extortion and money - laundering in august after a rancorous two - month trial , with a federal jury linking him to 11 killings			1
federal prosecutors urged district judge @entity76 to hand down a life sentence for the longtime fugitive , calling him one of the city 's " most violent and despicable criminals			2
" on wednesday , @entity81 ruled -- despite the objections of @entity2 's attorneys -- that the families of all 19 people killed by him or his associates would deliver victim impact statements			1
asked by the judge at one point whether he has anything to say , @entity2 -- in an orange jumpsuit and sneakers -- said no. @entity93 said she would hear all the victims and determine later which statements were relevant to the sentencing			1
mostly , it was a day for the victims -- a procession of human suffering chronicling some of the darkest years of the city 's history			1
@entity104 recounted the life of her husband , @entity107 , a @entity109 vet and @entity0 cop			1
he was an innocent bystander shot by @entity2			1
she was shaky and teary but regained her composure when talking about her husband			0
" he was always happy , " she said			0
" it drove me crazy			0
" at @entity2 's trial , @entity104 and her three sons often sat in the front row			1
when @entity2 said he would not take the stand , @entity104 yelled , " coward ! " -- a word that was repeated by some at wednesday 's sentencing			1
she said of her late husband : " he would cook a prime rib so well done you did n't know what you were eating ... @entity107 was kind and thoughtful			0
he 'd send me long - stem roses for birthdays and anniversaries			0
he 'd also send them when he was in the dog house			0
" @entity2 : the 25 - million - dollar man ? @entity134 said he was born four days after his father , @entity135 , was gunned down in a drive - by shooting on @entity0 's @entity137			1
his mother could not attend the funeral			0
according to trial testimony , @entity2 was in one of the cars in the drive - by shooting			1
" every time i drive that boulevard i think of the horror that man went through , " he said			0
" every time i pass the spot he was killed , i bless myself twice , seal it with a kiss and look up to him			0
one for him , one for me			0
" @entity154 , the 49 - year - old son of @entity155 , who was killed in 1974 , called the architect of the long reign of terror on the streets of @entity0 " @entity32			1
" the electric chair , he said , would be too good for him			0
" in ' 75 you stooped to an all - time low when you called my house and said , ' your father is not coming home for @entity164 , ' " @entity155 said			0
he recalled that when he asked the caller who was on the phone , @entity2 responded : " this is @entity168			1
" " my father was no @entity170 , " he said , " but he was a better man than you will ever be			0
" @entity174 , the daughter of @entity175 , who went missing in 1983 after a dispute with @entity2 , politely asked , " mr. @entity2 , could you please look at me ? " he never looked up			1
" i just want you to know that i do n't hate you , " she said			0
" i do hate the choices you made			0
... i hate the choices our government has made that allowed you to rule streets			0
" @entity174 added , " hours before ( my father ) was murdered , he was praying , from what i understood , to a picture of a little girl			0
... you will be summoned to the highest judge			0
a lethal injection would be too easy of a punishment			0
" she addressed him one more time			0
" mr. @entity2 , do you have remorse for taking my father 's life ? " the convicted killer did not look up			1
" i think you do , " she said			0
" in a november 7 sentencing memorandum , @entity201 attorney @entity200 wrote : " presiding over a massive criminal enterprise , @entity2 extorted dozens of individuals , flooded @entity0 with cocaine , shot innocent people , strangled women , murdered his competitors , corrupted @entity211 agents , and then ran away and hid for 16 years			1
" she added , " there are no mitigating factors , and defendant @entity2 has no redeeming qualities which would justify any sentence below the one called for by the @entity216 and the applicable case law and statutes			1
" prosecutor : @entity2 ' deserves no mercy , ' should get life sentence @entity2 did n't testify at his trial , complaining the proceedings were " a sham			1
" @entity2 was captured in @entity225 in 2011 , a decade and a half after skipping town ahead of a pending indictment			2
after he fled , investigators learned that the longtime head of @entity0 's @entity14 had been an @entity211 informant and that @entity2 's @entity211 handler had not only tipped him off to the charges , but also gave up another informant , who was later killed			1
meanwhile , @entity2 's brother @entity234 had risen from the family 's blue - collar @entity236 neighborhood to become president of the state @entity239 and head of the @entity242			2
but in 2003 , he was forced to resign the school 's presidency after admitting to a congressional committee that he had spoken to his brother while @entity2 was on the run , though he denied any knowledge of his whereabouts or alleged criminal activity			1
@entity2 denied being an informant , even as he insisted that he 'd had an immunity deal with the former head of the @entity255 's @entity254 in @entity256			2
prosecutors countered that with a 700 - page file outlining how @entity2 provided information on murders , drug deals , armed robberies and criminal fugitives that led to several arrests			2
the tale became the basis for the @entity268 - winning film " @entity269 , " which starred @entity270 as a character modeled on @entity2			2
at the trial , @entity2 snarled , hissed and scowled at prosecutors and witnesses			2
at one point , he and onetime enforcer @entity275 shouted obscenities at each other when @entity275 called @entity2 a " rat " during his testimony			2
but @entity275 told @entity1 after the verdict that the @entity2 who sat at the defense table was a shadow of the underworld legend he 'd once known			2
" he was n't the same guy i knew , " @entity275 said			0
" i mean , he 's a lot older , but he had no life in his eyes			2
he just kind of lost his spark			0
" their lives had one thing in common : ' @entity293 @entity1 's @entity294 reported from @entity0 , while @entity295 reported and wrote in @entity296			2
@entity1 's @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299 contributed to this report .			0
