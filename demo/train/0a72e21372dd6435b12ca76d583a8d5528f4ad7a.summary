what would you do if you only had one day to live ? probably not spend time downloading and fiddling with a mobile app , we 're guessing			1
but a new app , @entity6 , wants you to embrace life in just that way			1
it lets you create a social network geared toward meeting new people around you , sharing photos and videos of what you 're up to and supporting other users who are also living it up			1
using gps , @entity6 identifies other users close to you and shows them your posts			1
they may then " cheer " or comment on those posts and , if both parties agree , they can become " 24 - hour friends			1
" there 's an option for users who hit it off to make each other permanent parts of their network			2
the kicker is that , anything you do using the app is totally erased after 24 hours			2
texts you send to other users disappear after a few seconds and photos or videos you share can go away nearly as quickly			2
the app 's co-founder , @entity41 , says that in an era when your third - grade teacher can find you on @entity46 and anyone you 've ever met at work wants to network on @entity49 , people are craving an app like @entity6			1
it lets them share without worrying their actions will go down on their permanent record			0
" it promotes sharing only the most refreshing contents and leading a casual relationship with no strings attached , " said @entity41 , an alum of @entity56 , @entity49 and @entity57			1
so , you can call sobrr the @entity63			0
but if you want to call it @entity65 meets @entity66 meets @entity67 , you would n't be that far - off either			2
the app 's name reflects the moment the idea first dawned on @entity41 -- the morning after a @entity73 bachelor party			1
he says he noticed all of his fellow partyers rushing onto their social media accounts to make sure they had n't shared any incriminating info about the previous night			0
no , @entity41 says , his app is n't just another tool for the hookup culture or a way to send naughty photos without having to answer for them later			0
but if somebody wants to use it that way ? he 's not here to stop them			0
" from the party animals that i 've surveyed , more than half admitted that they want to meet new people in the party , and crave for a one - night stand , " he said			0
@entity6 lets users post content " that they might otherwise feel too embarrassed to post on other platforms , " he said			2
@entity41 also said it 's important for users " to have their own space and little secrets			0
" but he maintains that " naughty stuff " is only a small part of what users have been sharing in the month since the app 's release			1
" we understand that ' hooking up ' is the need of many users on the platform , but we really value more of the casual interaction and conversation on the platform -- the foreplay of hooking up , " he said			0
" people are more attracted by each other based on their life moments or a common interest			0
" it 's possible the @entity125 startup is onto something			0
in the past year or so , ephemeral messaging apps such as @entity66 , @entity128 and @entity129 have flourished			2
so far , the app 's user base remains relatively small , boasting 10,000 users in the weeks it 's been available exclusively for @entity135 's mobile devices			1
whether more folks will flock to it to live a more carefree social media life , or merely hide the evidence from their wild nights out , remains to be seen .			0
