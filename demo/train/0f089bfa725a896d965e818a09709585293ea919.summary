-- the government 's open			0
@entity2 is back at work			0
@entity6 , licking their wounds , are asking themselves what 's next			0
and president @entity8 has thrown down the gauntlet : the top item on his agenda is immigration reform			1
what are the chances that the @entity6 will now move ahead on immigration ? the answer will have less to do with immigration than with how the budget battle has changed the larger political dynamic in @entity2			1
@entity6 @entity21 ' views on immigration are untested , and many advocates for reform believe they are implacably hostile			2
but the truth is @entity27 opinion has been evolving since the 2012 election			2
more and more @entity21 , perhaps the majority , know that reform is overdue and that the @entity27 must be part of the solution -- to remain competitive with @entity34 voters and because it 's the right thing to do			1
individual lawmakers and essential staff continued to work on the issue even through the dark days of the shutdown			2
and members are coalescing around answers to the hardest of the hard questions : what to do about immigrants living in the @entity45 illegally ? @entity6 majority leader @entity46 is working on a bill that would create a path to citizenship for " dreamers " brought to the @entity45 illegally as children			2
and one recent informal count found 84 @entity6 -- more than one third of the total -- in favor of legal status for the @entity58 ' parents			1
bottom line : if it were n't for the rancor of the budget brawl , the @entity6 might be in a good place on immigration , with @entity21 ready to move forward and pass a package of measures they could send to a conference with the @entity69 bill			2
opinion : key to immigration reform -- worker visas so what exactly is the fallout from the budget battle ? surprisingly , it appears to cut both ways -- both for and against the prospect of an immigration overhaul			1
even before the government reopened , two different factions were making their voices heard			0
some , such as rep. @entity83 of @entity84 -- an opponent of the budget deal but a strong proponent of immigration reform -- argued that the budget battle had made it hard , if not impossible , for @entity6 to reach a deal with @entity8			1
others , such as rep. @entity92 of @entity93 , who voted for the budget package , said it 's time to get back to the give and take of governing -- time to sit down with @entity98 and compromise , including on immigration			2
opinion : it 's not @entity103 holding up immigration reform which of these two sentiments will prove stronger in the @entity6 ? @entity27 lawmakers are reeling from their recent drubbing			1
skepticism and negativity are at an all - time high			0
and it will take both kinds of champions -- tough - minded and accommodating -- to negotiate a deal			0
but if enough other republicans agree with @entity92 and make their views known , that could empower leadership to open the way to consideration of some immigration bills			0
a handful of hard - line conservatives -- the group that opposed the budget deal -- still hold enormous sway in the @entity6			0
and just because speaker @entity128 waived the so - called @entity130 rule once -- bringing the legislation that ended the shutdown up for a vote when he knew it lacked support from the majority of the @entity27 majority -- does n't mean he 'll do that again anytime soon			2
the @entity6 @entity27 conference is only as strong as it is cohesive , and the majority - of - the - majority rule has proved a good way to maintain that power and cohesion			1
still , the complex dynamic that drives @entity21 in the @entity6 may have shifted somewhat in the shutdown			0
certainly you hear a lot more grumbling , in private and in public , about the power of the hard - line naysayers			0
other members are tired of being held hostage			0
many want to get on with governing , making deals on a wide range of issues			0
and a few , such as @entity92 , are starting to say so , even on tv			0
opinion : how @entity8 can clinch immigration deal that 's a ray of hope			1
but there 's still another danger looming			0
the one thing @entity6 are not going to do in the wake of the budget battle -- not on any issue , in any circumstances -- is a favor for @entity8			1
and to the degree that immigration reform is seen as @entity8 's issue , it will be dead on arrival in the @entity6			1
the question for @entity6 , leadership and rank and file : do they want to cede the issue to @entity8 ? can they afford to let him own it ? more and more of the @entity27 grasps that that 's a mistake			1
it 's a disaster politically for the party and a mistake for the nation , which needs reform , urgently , for the sake of the economy and the rule of law			0
what 's needed in the @entity6 now is not a favor for @entity8 , but a strong conservative answer on one of the most vexing issues facing the nation			1
will @entity6 @entity21 see it that way ? can they take ownership and move forward ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : after budget battle , @entity27 may be in no mood for immigration overhaul
but many in @entity27 favor legal status and have been working on reforms , she says
she says others refuse to do president @entity8 any favor by addressing issue
@entity204 : @entity27 must take ownership , provide a strong conservative *approach* to reform
