-- for many political observers , last night 's loss by @entity2 was one of the biggest shocks of our political careers			1
the @entity9 @entity8 majority leader was easily defeated by an almost unknown challenger whom he heavily outspent			0
it 's been reported that @entity2 's team spent more on steakhouses than his opponent did on his entire campaign			1
no one had a clue this was about to happen , including @entity2 himself			2
just days before the primary , his camp leaked an internal poll showing him ahead by 34 points			0
no @entity8 majority leader has lost a primary since the position was created in 1899			0
while the result was unexpected , it confirms something we already knew			0
in the @entity9 civil war , the tea party has won			1
it 's more than just @entity2 's loss			1
a week earlier , sen. @entity35 , @entity36 , was forced into a runoff by tea party candidate @entity38			1
and the @entity9 primary winner in @entity41 's 2nd @entity40 is closely connected to gov. @entity42 and his disastrous tea party agenda that has hurt the state			1
and even the candidates who are supposed to be the establishment have been pulled so far to the right by tea party challengers that there is no difference in their policies or rhetoric			1
@entity53 held off his primary opponent only by leaving no room for him to run , opposing anything and everything offered by president @entity58			0
now , as the embodiment of partisan obstruction in @entity61 , he 'll have trouble against @entity63 , a mainstream @entity64 candidate			0
as majority leader , @entity2 guided @entity8 @entity9 ' vastly out - of - touch agenda			2
perhaps that is why it was so difficult for political operatives to believe that he could be defeated by a challenger alleging that he was not conservative enough			0
@entity2 has gone out of his way to set an agenda that appeals to the @entity9 's @entity31 wing , at the expense of middle - class families who could have benefited from the preferred mainstream approach of @entity64			1
but apparently , he was just not extreme enough for today 's @entity9			2
the repercussions of @entity2 's loss will reverberate for @entity9			1
opinion : real lesson in @entity2 's loss -- beware conventional wisdom their far right agenda is already hurting them in general elections			1
i shudder to think what @entity9 presidential contenders will say in a 2016 primary to win over voters who think @entity2 is n't conservative enough			2
but even this year , the effect will be felt			0
we 're only about halfway through the primary calendar			0
in addition to the @entity99 runoff , @entity96 's @entity95 will hold a convention next week to select their candidate			0
the last time the state used a convention , we wound up with rep. @entity105			0
on tuesday night , @entity107 @entity9 @entity106 expressed his fear that the results " will move the party further to the right , which will marginalize us further as a national party			2
" he does n't need to look any further than his home state to see how the tea party is relegating the @entity9 to the sidelines			1
opinion : who said the tea party was dead ? we 'll also see how @entity2 's loss affects @entity31 primary challenges this summer in @entity122 and @entity123			1
the @entity64 and its candidates remain committed to helping provide economic security to middle - class families and addressing serious issues such as commonsense immigration reform			0
meanwhile , @entity9 one - upsmanship to appeal to the @entity31 base threatens to keep their party in the minority and out of the @entity8 for the foreseeable future			2
join us on @entity135 / @entity134 .			0

@entity137 says @entity2 's defeat means the @entity31 *takeover* is complete
several other tea party *favorites* had strong showings tuesday
