@entity0 -- after years of criticism , the @entity2 is taking the initial steps to modify screening for people age 75 or older			1
beginning monday , the @entity2 will test procedures allowing those passengers to leave their shoes on , as well as light outerwear			1
other changes are intended to reduce the likelihood that older passengers will be subjected to a pat - down			2
some airports want private screeners the tests will be conducted at four airports : @entity20 's @entity19 , @entity21 , @entity22 in @entity23 , and @entity24			1
if they are successful , the @entity2 could expand the procedures to checkpoints nationwide			2
the new protocols closely parallel changes implemented last fall for passengers age 12 and under , and for the same reason -- intelligence indicates that they are unlikely to be involved in a terrorist attack , the @entity2 said			2
@entity2 spokesman @entity33 said the agency is trying to " move away from the one - size - fits - all approach " to security screening			0
the changes will manage risk , but not eliminate it , he said			0
@entity39 changes safety reporting culture at the selected checkpoints , passengers 75 and older will be allowed to leave their shoes and light outerwear on			1
if the full - body scanner detects an anomaly , the passenger will be allowed a second pass through the machine to resolve the issue			0
if the matter is still unresolved , the @entity2 screeners will be able to use other methods , such as an explosive trace detection test , before subjecting the traveler to a physical pat down			0
passengers may be required to remove shoes and may still undergo a pat - down if anomalies persist			0
@entity2 officers will make a visual assessment to determine which passengers are 75 or older , the agency said			1
the @entity2 said the new procedures will allow officers to better focus on passengers who may be more likely to pose a risk to transportation while expediting the screening process .			0

the procedures being tested make allowances for people age 75 and older
they do *n't* have to take off their shoes or light outerwear , for *instance*
the tests are starting at checkpoints in @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity80 and @entity81
