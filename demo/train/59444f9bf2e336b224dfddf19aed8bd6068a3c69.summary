as april 15 approaches , the fact that we tell time in circles brings us to remember the attack on the @entity5 one year ago			1
but what exactly is there to remember ? beyond the facts , what 's worth keeping so close that it becomes a part of ourselves ? that matters			2
every memory changes us , so what we choose to remember depends on -- and reveals -- what sort of people we want to be			2
of course , the memories of the three people who were killed that day certainly will stay forever in the hearts of those who knew and loved them			2
the pain of the survivors will not be forgotten quickly			2
but for those of us who do not know any of the victims , what does it mean to remember their pain and the suffering of their loved ones ? that terrible things happen ? that sometimes those terrible things are caused on purpose ? we 'll be reminded of those facts by the heightened security at the 2014 @entity5			1
it would be foolish to forget that the marathon is an inviting target			0
why hundreds will race for @entity42 but focusing solely on the pain and loss of the victims does n't lead us any further			2
in fact , if taken to an extreme , it can cause us to forget some of our rights and freedoms , just as the memory of 9/11 's horrors led us to cede freedoms of movement and privacy to which we had been long accustomed			0
so we will learn lessons about security -- perhaps not all of them appropriate			0
more positively , what should we be remembering and thus letting change us ? for me , one thing to remember is that not a single person who made it to the local medical facilities died			1
in part it was because of the calm determination of those who took care of the injured at the site , moving them to medical facilities where professionals cared for them immediately and through long rehabilitations			1
it 's well worth remembering that in the midst of chaos and danger , the needs of others can drive off our fear			1
but from this i also remember the importance of having a medical infrastructure in place , with people and equipment ready to help			0
the power of training , dedication and an investment in facilities is worth remembering , and then acting on			1
i remember how wrong the mainstream media went in its early reportage , and how lost we could become on the @entity95			1
the mainstream media made flat - out errors , and a discussion at @entity99 misidentified a killer , causing the falsely accused student 's family great pain			1
we should remember that there are consequences to idle speculation			1
that should make us more patient and more tentative in our judgments			0
knowledge can be hurried but not rushed			0
@entity42 bombing survivor , a year later likewise , i remember being shocked that the younger of the brothers accused in the attack was described so warmly by his school friends as an accepting and empathetic person			1
from these descriptions , we could learn that no one is to be trusted			0
i take a different lesson , although one not nearly as neat and clean : people are infinitely complex and never entirely knowable			0
i remember the day @entity42 stayed inside as the killers were hunted			0
we did this not out of fear -- the chance that they would come down your street with guns blazing was minuscule -- but because it was all we could do to help bring to justice the murderers who attacked our city at a moment of civic celebration			0
@entity42 was strong because @entity133 acted in solidarity			2
that strength is well worth remembering			1
and then there is the memory of the murderers themselves			0
but i see no reason to remember their names .			0

@entity144 : what is worth remembering a year after the @entity5 attack ?

investment in medicine made care possible , and @entity133 helped each other , he says
@entity144 : media , *web* often got things wrong , showing dangers of idle speculation
