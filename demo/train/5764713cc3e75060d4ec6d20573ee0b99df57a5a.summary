-- a spacecraft survived the closest encounter ever with a comet on thursday , tracking it just 435 miles from the comet 's nucleus			1
mission control at @entity8 's @entity7 in @entity9 , @entity10 , broadcast live coverage of the event on @entity14 's @entity13			0
controllers broke into applause after hearing of the success			0
the agency 's @entity19 spacecraft was expected to use two imagers and an infrared instrument to acquire data about a tiny comet named @entity25 as it traveled at speeds of more than 27,000 miles per hour			1
scientists are still working to determine whether there was any damage to the spacecraft as the peanut - shaped comet passed by			2
they hope to learn to more about comets from five images detailing the close approach			1
" those early images may not be the ' money shot , ' but we on the science team will prize them just as well , as they will help us further understand the nature of comets , " said @entity19 principal investigator @entity36 of the @entity37 , @entity37 , in a @entity8 statement			1
" we certainly have our hands full			0
the images are full of great cometary data , and that 's what we hoped for			0
" the images are expected to depict the comet nucleus as little more than a point of light with a fuzzy coma , a gaseous cloud , surrounding it			0
" it was just incredible , " @entity57 , associate administrator of the @entity58 for @entity8 , said of the encounter			0
five years after @entity8 launched an 800 - pound projectile into a comet in an effort to study its contents , the same spacecraft that launched the missile tracked @entity25 on thursday			1
it is the first spacecraft to have visited two comets			2
@entity8 officials expressed hope that such missions will inspire young people to get into the field of space exploration .			2

@entity25 passes just 435 miles from spacecraft
@entity19 @entity19 is the first spacecraft to have visited two comets
scientists hope to learn more about comets from close imagery
