-- the debate in @entity2 this week about whether to pay for extending the payroll tax cut by imposing a new tax on millionaires will have nothing to do with solving our nation 's economic challenges and everything to do with election - year politics			1
@entity14 @entity13 leaders have already signaled they will use the debate as a purely partisan exercise designed to embarrass @entity16 into opposing tax cuts for the poor while defending tax cuts for the rich			1
i intend to offer an alternative			2
instead of punishing the rich with higher taxes , i will give @entity2 the option of helping pay for extending the payroll tax cut by ending welfare to the wealthy			1
read sen. @entity30 's report , " subsidies of the @entity32 " every year , politicians on both sides engage in a process of reverse @entity36 in which they steal $ 30 billion from low - and middle - income @entity39 and provide handouts to the rich and famous			1
millionaires receive tax earmarks and deductions crafted by both parties that allow them to write off billions each year			1
these write - offs include mortgage interest deductions on second homes and luxury yachts , gambling losses , business expenses , electric vehicle credits and even child care tax credits			1
meanwhile , direct handouts for millionaires have included $ 74 million in unemployment checks , $ 316 million in farm subsidies , $ 89 million for preservation of ranches and estates , $ 9 billion in retirement checks and $ 7.5 million to compensate for damages caused by emergencies to property that should have been insured			1
millionaires have even borrowed $ 16 million in government - backed education loans to attend college since 2007			1
the goal of highlighting these excesses is not to demonize those who are successful			0
instead , by highlighting the sheer stupidity of pampering the wealthy with lavish benefits through our safety net and tax code , i hope to make a moral and economic argument for real entitlement and tax reform			2
the most troubling gap in @entity39 today is not an income gap			0
it is an integrity gap -- and even intelligence gap -- between @entity85 and the rest of the country			0
families are struggling to make ends meet and are making painful economic choices as politicians in @entity85 borrow billions to provide welfare to the wealthy			0
politicians on both sides refuse to fix big problems and defend stupid policies because changing those policies would involve upending a comfortable political status quo			0
it 's important for taxpayers to understand that these distortions are not accidental loopholes in the law			2
to the contrary , these provisions are intentional efforts to get all @entity39 to buy into a system where everyone appears to benefit while the poor and middle class are being robbed			0
in the case of entitlements such as @entity112 , progressives have argued for decades that a program for poor people will be a poor program			0
yet , @entity115 hardly needs the same retirement check as his secretary			0
ending welfare handouts to millionaires will strengthen , not undermine , the safety net for people who need it most			1
even @entity122 has adopted means testing in its retirement program by limiting benefits for high - earners			0
that fact is we ca n't afford the system we have today			0
only by adopting common - sense reforms can we sustain a safety net for those who truly need assistance			0
on the tax side , both parties have been reluctant to alter tax earmarks and deductions , such as the mortgage interest deduction			1
yet , it 's hard to understand how limiting the mortgage interest deductions for yachts will hurt working families			1
defending spending in the tax code is not conservative			2
providing tax earmarks and deductions to millionaires is a tax increase on everyone who does n't receive the benefit			1
the only way we will enact real tax reform , and grow the economy , is by lowering tax rates and broadening the base by scaling back these egregious handouts			2
this is precisely what president @entity162 did in 1986			0
even though the super committee failed to reach an agreement on broad deficit reduction , there is no reason why the other super committee -- @entity2 -- should drag its feet			0
change in @entity85 tends to start with small steps			0
there is no better place to start than scaling back ludicrous handouts to millionaires that expose an entitlement system and tax code that desperately need to be reformed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity30 .			2

@entity30 : it 's not necessary to raise taxes on the rich to pay for payroll tax cut
instead , he says , end the annual $ 30 billion in tax break handouts to the rich and famous
@entity30 : they get deductions for second homes , yachts , gambling losses , child care
earmarks , deductions for millionaires amount to a tax hike on everyone else , he says
