@entity0 in felt peak caps and with long embroidered coats , the eagle hunters of @entity3 are an arresting sight			1
with golden eagles , some standing almost 3 - feet - high perched on their arms , they also carry with pride the @entity3 tradition of hunting using birds of prey that stretches back to the days of @entity15			1
the practice of hunting with eagles and falcons was almost wiped out by the @entity20 who regarded it as a feudal throwback , but thanks to organized eagle - hunting competitions - and a growing interest in @entity3 traditions - the eagle hunters are making a comeback			1
a bird show at @entity29 , situated outside the city of @entity31 , uses a wolf - skin lure to demonstrate the lethal striking ability of trained eagles			0
one of the world 's largest @entity36 , a golden eagle can swoop on quarry as large as a wolf , reaching speeds of 120 mph in its initial strike			2
its talons can exert pressure of upwards of 200 pounds per square inch , allowing it to hold down prey while ripping into it with a razor - sharp hooked beak			0
according to @entity52 , one the leading bird handlers in @entity3 , hunting with eagles is unique to the country and neighboring @entity54 , noting that there are now some 50 eagle handlers @entity3			1
" most of eagle handlers are happy to make a living posing for photographs for tourists , " says @entity52 , but he notes that there is a very small group of around 10 traditional eagle hunters still who ride the @entity3 steppes seeking out live prey			1
as interest in the @entity3 tradition of falconry and eagling increases , shows such as those at the @entity29 sanctuary are helping to finance programs to preserve the @entity76 habitat of another of the country 's birds of prey , the saker falcon			1
" there are a lot more conservation groups now , " says @entity52			0
" and they are attracting a lot more money than before			0
" it 's an important project as @entity3 's falcons , unlike its eagles , are in the sights of poachers			1
" i would say in the past two decades the numbers of saker falcons ( in @entity3 ) has dropped by 90 % , " says @entity52			1
the birds are listed as " endangered " on the @entity96 's @entity95 that notes the species " may be undergoing a very rapid decline "			0
wealthy states in the @entity100 like the @entity101 are the main destination for wild - caught birds , where a falcon perched on the leather glove of a rich @entity101 is as potent a status symbol as a private jet or top - end @entity108			1
efforts to send birds back to @entity3 , like a recent program by the @entity112 to return 66 falcons to their natural habitat , are small in comparison to the size of the market			2
the 150 birds bred each year as part of the @entity29 's breeding program also represent a mere drop in the bucket compared to the estimated thousands smuggled out of the country			0
the international black market in hunting falcons is estimated to be worth as much as $ 300 million a year , according to conservation groups , with gyr , saker and peregrine falcons commanding as much as $ 200,000 a bird			2
it is so lucrative that a 2010 documentary called " @entity133 " alleged it is linked to the murky world of funding for @entity137 terrorism			0
@entity52 believes the problem is a simple equation of too many people , too few nature reserves and a thriving foreign market			0
" now you can drive anywhere in @entity3 and this allows people to get to more and more areas of the falcons ' habitat , " he says			2
" there are specialist teams operating that capture wild falcons			2
it 's a very organized , it has its own hierarchy and everyone knows who they are -- it 's a kind of @entity159 , " he adds			0
despite the problems for the saker falcon , the @entity3 tradition of hunting with @entity36 -- especially the golden eagle - is not likely to die out in the near future			1
the sheer size of the bird , mixed with the difficulty of training a raptor that can present as much a danger to its handler as its prey , means its numbers in @entity3 are presently stable			0
" there is just no foreign market for these birds , " says @entity52 .			0

tradition of hunting with golden eagles remains in @entity3
most handlers survive through doing shows , although some use to hunt
@entity3 's falcons *targeted* by poachers for sale in @entity100
number of native saker falcons in wild is rapidly declining
