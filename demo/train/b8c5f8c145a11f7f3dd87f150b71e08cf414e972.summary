editor 's note : rep. @entity2 , a @entity3 , represents @entity5 's 2nd @entity4 and is appearing in @entity7 's " freshman year " series along with rep. @entity8 , a @entity9 from @entity10			1
@entity2 says @entity12 's immigration system is broken and urgently needs reform			1
( @entity7 ) -- twelve - year - old @entity14 courageously took the stage			0
fighting back tears , he told how he came home from school one day to find that his father had been taken into an immigration detention facility			2
his father , an entrepreneur who had created dozens of jobs , was " exactly the kind of person we want in this country			0
" and there was n't a dry eye in the place as this young @entity12 boy told the audience how the next time he saw his father , he was traumatized to find him " in a prison " surrounded by men with guns			2
on june 13 , i sponsored an immigration town hall in my home state of @entity5 to discuss the harm our broken immigration system is causing @entity12 families and the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform			1
more than 1,600 attendees , including representatives from @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity49 faiths , filled the @entity50 in @entity51 and spilled outside onto the lawn in the hot june sun. catholic archbishop @entity54 -- despite our many differences -- joined me onstage to urge people of faith to stand up for immigration reform			1
the audience listened with rapt attention as @entity14 and several other @entity12 directly impacted by our broken immigration laws recounted their haunting tales			1
our current immigration system is broken and greatly in need of reform			1
in order to create real , long - lasting reform , we must create a pathway to legal status for the millions of undocumented immigrants who have made lives for themselves and their families in the @entity12			1
it is essential for our national security to know who resides within our borders			0
and this phenomenon is not unique to @entity5 ; throughout the country , @entity12 agree that it is time to reform our broken immigration system			1
according to a recent poll of 1,000 voters by the @entity89 , more than eight in 10 @entity86 , @entity9 and independent voters support @entity90 passing comprehensive reform , as do 86 percent of voters who are undecided on the 2010 congressional race			2
only 14 percent oppose the reform			0
@entity12 agree that comprehensive immigration reform is fair to both taxpayers ( 81 percent agree ) and illegal immigrants ( 79 percent agree ) , and 91 percent agree that the comprehensive proposal would help taxpayers by making illegal immigrants pay taxes			1
if we secure our borders and crack down on employers who illegally hire , and deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes , nearly seven in 10 ( 68 percent ) voters argue that the remaining 12 million illegal immigrants should be required to register , meet conditions and eventually be allowed to apply for citizenship			0
a whopping 62 percent of self - identified republicans say they should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship			0
clearly , @entity12 agree that the economic and national security burdens placed on state and local governments -- not to mention the incredible hardships placed on immigrant families -- because of the failures of federal immigration policy are unfair and that we desperately need meaningful reform			1
it is rare to find this kind of across - the - board consensus , and it indicates that rather than demagoguery , the @entity12 people want action			2
our town hall 's other special guest , my colleague rep. @entity129 , @entity131 , formed the @entity135 movement			0
it works to bring diverse groups to the table from faith - based organizations , civil rights groups , unions and businesses to demand comprehensive immigration reform			1
thanks to their leadership , progressives and conservatives in @entity5 and across the country are working to urge president @entity149 and @entity90 to take it up this year			0
@entity151 alone is not the solution			0
we tried amnesty in the late 1980s , and because we never took serious steps at enforcement , we wound up in precisely the same predicament 20 years later			0
if all we do is pass amnesty , we will likely be having the same debate again a few years			0
likewise , the " enforcement - only " policies of the past few years have failed and have resulted only in even more illegal immigration and the separation of @entity12 families			1
trying to enforce our out - of - touch laws is as foolish and impossible as trying to enforce a law requiring that water flow uphill			0
the good news is that we can solve this issue			0
we can pass practical comprehensive immigration reform			1
crafting a solution to this complex problem will require a debate , which should begin without delay			0
citizens and elected leaders of this great nation must realize our common goal of putting an end to illegal immigration and demand immigration reform now			1
we are a nation of immigrants			2
our diversity has always been our strength			0
we should be thankful that we have even have this problem to consider , thankful that @entity12 continues to be a beacon of hope and liberty , and thankful that the best and brightest from across the globe are fighting to start a better life in our country and take part in the @entity12 dream			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity12 's strength comes from being a nation of immigrants , @entity2 says
