-- @entity5 , the behemoth sports management agency that represents three of tennis ' biggest stars in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , is no longer working with controversial @entity9 @entity8			1
@entity5 said in a tweet wednesday that it " mutually ended " its relationship with the 21 - year - old , days after the @entity11 reported the sides were going their separate ways before their contract expired			1
when asked for confirmation that the contract was cut short , @entity5 did n't immediately respond and an interview request made to the @entity22 early morning @entity20 time for @entity8 was n't immediately returned			1
@entity8 is competing at a tournament in @entity20			2
@entity0 understands that the @entity8 camp has approached his former agent , @entity25 , who is now at @entity26			0
@entity26 represents , among others , @entity28 and 2014 @entity30 champion @entity29			0
@entity31 , a reporter with the @entity11 , tweeted that @entity5 " appears 2 have had enough " with @entity8			1
@entity8 had multiple hip surgery this year and his ranking has fallen almost 100 spots to 124th in two years but he -- and his father -- have repeatedly made headlines for their indiscretions			2
his father @entity38 was found guilty of assaulting @entity8 's former hitting partner and last year handed a suspended eight - month sentence			2
the player himself was on the wrong end of the quickest loss -- not including retirements -- in recorded @entity22 history when he was pummeled by @entity47 in 28 minutes in @entity48 in march ; he has also been caught speeding more than once			0
he 's been accused of tanking ( or not trying in matches ) ; was pictured topless receiving a lapdance in november ; and booed when he retired against @entity52 at the @entity30 in january			0
police had to be called late in 2012 when @entity8 and another man were fighting outdoors in an apartment complex			0
@entity5 and other agencies were attracted to @entity8 while he was a junior , given his eye - catching results			1
and his stature grew when he in 2011 became the youngest man since @entity60 25 years earlier to reach the @entity62 quarterfinals			0
but @entity8 is n't @entity9 's top hope now , replaced by the man who beat @entity52 at @entity62 , 19 - year - old @entity65 .			1

management agency @entity5 and @entity8 mutually end their partnership
@entity5 in a tweet *wishes* @entity8 ' great *success* on and off the tennis court '
the @entity9 has struggled both on and off the court in the last year
this week he won back - to - back matches for the first time since january
