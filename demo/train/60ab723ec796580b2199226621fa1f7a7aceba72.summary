@entity0 is a soft - spoken 73 - year - old , who thinks carefully before he describes his first memory as a three - year old child			1
" i remember my mother			2
a green skirt with white flowers and a white blouse , " he says in @entity7			2
" on the left , there was a bed and my brother was sleeping			1
i remember i had a brother			1
" that memory is crucial			2
until a few months ago , @entity0 had no evidence his brother even existed			1
@entity0 is a survivor of @entity19			1
he was four - and - a - half when the camp was liberated in january 1945			1
in the chaos and confusion , he does n't remember how he came to be separated from his brother , but he sought a way out			1
" i was in the camp			1
a man came in who was looking for his wife and daughter , " he recalls			2
" i stood before him and asked if he would be my father			2
he picked me up in his hands and took me out of the camp			1
" his adopted father named him @entity32 and took him to @entity33 where he now lives			1
over the years , his father searched for his adopted son 's birth family			1
at first , there were some positive responses , but after a number of false hopes , @entity0 gave up the painful process of trying to find his family , and began to wonder if his memories were simply dreams			1
then last year , urged by his grandchildren , he tried again , posting the only clues he had on the internet : a photo of himself , aged five , and another that he believed was a family photo			2
genealogist @entity51 responded to his post			2
she took one look at that family photo and knew it was not his			2
" i said that 's not your family			2
he said , ' yes , that 's me , i 'm the baby			0
' i said , ' no , if that 's you where is your brother ? where is the other baby ? ' i could see he was shocked at that			2
" @entity0 has no memory of how he obtained the photo , only that it was in his pocket the day @entity19 was liberated			1
at first , he was crushed			0
one of the few clues he had was a false start			0
but @entity51 reminded him that he had another lead , one he would never forget , because it is tattooed on his arm			0
the blue ink is faded and stretched , but @entity0 quietly reads the @entity76 number that will never be erased : a 7733			1
now he is looking for a 7734 : the number of his identical twin brother			1
@entity51 checked the numbers against official @entity19 records now archived at the @entity81 in @entity82			1
she discovered @entity0 was born @entity83 , in @entity84			1
he had an identical twin named @entity86 , who was last seen by @entity88 doctors in @entity19			1
" we know that he was declared healthy on february 9 , 1945 , by medical staff , " @entity51 says			0
" that is really the last factual reference that i have			0
" @entity51 also found other , more disturbing records , showing that the twins were subjected to experiments by @entity96 , the @entity97 doctor dubbed the " @entity101 " for his gruesome experiments on humans , particularly twins			0
perhaps thankfully , @entity0 has no memory of that			1
@entity51 has not ventured further into the @entity97 historical archives in @entity105 to find out more about what happened to @entity0 in the camp , and he insists he does not want to know -- but he does want to trace his brother			1
now , the pair have turned to social media for help , setting up a @entity113 page , a 7734 , which has been viewed more than a million times			1
each time the page is shared , @entity51 hopes it brings them one step closer to finding @entity86			1
several nurses have contacted her after seeing what might be the matching tattoo			2
" it 's like a thread , " @entity51 explains			0
" there 's three types : one that leads to nowhere			0
one you think will go somewhere , and you reach a deadlock			0
and then there 's one that takes you to your destination			0
" @entity0 's grandchildren tease him that he has become an internet celebrity , even learning some of the lingo			1
" i 'm like a virus ! " he tells @entity51 , as she explains the meaning of " going viral			0
" @entity51 has also discovered more surprises about @entity0 's family , including the fact that he had a baby brother , @entity140 , who died in @entity19			1
@entity0 's birth father also died there but his mother , @entity143 , not only survived several @entity97 concentration camps , but returned to her home village of @entity146 on the @entity84 - @entity148 border , hoping to find her children			1
" i saw her signature on the document registering her acceptance of war aid , and the hair stood up on the back of my neck , " @entity51 recalls			0
" i am not a graphologist , but you could see , or i think anyway , she had character , strength despite all that had happened			0
and she listed the names of her sons too			0
it was as if she was saying : ' i am here			0
' " that document is the last evidence of @entity166			0
@entity51 does n't know exactly what happened to her , though stories from extended family members and villagers say that shortly after her return , she was rounded up with other returning @entity173 refugees and shot dead by nazi - sympathizers			2
@entity51 says she has no way of confirming that			0
the thought of his mother returning to their home village in search of her children makes @entity0 both sad and proud			1
" i am proud of this woman who did not lose hope and continued to look for us , " he tells @entity184			0
" it was a difficult journey in terrible conditions			0
i would not believe someone could survive all that			0
" i think i am also a survivor			0
maybe it 's in the genes			0
maybe it 's in my brother 's genes as well			2
" last year , @entity0 returned to the village where he was born for a visit			1
he met neighbours who described his family as happy , his father a well - regarded doctor and his mother a talented seamstress			2
they told him they remembered the boisterous blonde twins who played near the house			0
" i closed a circle , " he says			0
" it was just good to know that what i was dreaming was real and not my imagination			0
" @entity0 knows only too well that even if he finds @entity86 , it may be too late			1
asked what he would say to his brother , his answer is stoic			2
" i 'm sorry that i did not start looking for him sooner , " he says quietly			0
" there were so many years that i was afraid of even touching the subject			0
" the search for @entity86 is a source of both joy and pain for @entity0 , but he is committed to finishing it			1
there is one more discovery that has surprised him : his birthday			0
until now , he had always celebrated january 27 , 1945 , the day he left @entity19 , as his birthday , instead of his real date of birth			1
so , which day does he choose to celebrate now ? " both , of course ! " he says with a smile			0
" there is a lot to celebrate			0

@entity0 , born @entity83 , survived @entity19 as a child and was later adopted
now aged 73 , he is trying to trace his twin , @entity86 , who he last saw at the concentration camp
he hopes social media , including @entity113 , will help him find his long - lost brother
the pair , *originally* from @entity84 , have " matching " camp @entity76 tattoos : a 7733 and a 7734
