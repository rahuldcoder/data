followers of the @entity1 may go prehistoric on @entity2 this week			1
the publication has ranked the controversial diet last on its " @entity6 " list for 2014			2
each year , @entity2 asks experts to rank various nutrition plans to help consumers make informed decisions			0
this year the panel evaluated 32 of the most popular diets			0
to be top - rated , a diet has to be relatively easy to follow , nutritious , safe , effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease			1
first popularized in the 1970s , the @entity1 asks people to follow a diet similar to those who lived during the @entity20 era , between 2.6 million and 10,000 years ago			1
this means eating like hunters and gathers -- consuming lots of produce and animal protein , while avoiding sugar , grains , legumes and dairy altogether			0
" if the cavemen did n't eat it , you should n't either , " @entity2 summarized			0
the diet has gained a significant following in recent years , especially among the @entity36 crowd			0
" @entity1 " was the most searched diet term on @entity38 in 2013			1
being last on the @entity6 list does n't mean @entity1 is the worst diet ever ( the " @entity42 " did n't even make the list )			2
but @entity2 's experts said the @entity1 was too restrictive for most people to follow long term , and that it limited some essential nutrients			2
they also cited a lack of research proving the @entity1 's cardiovascular health and weight loss benefits in their ranking			1
the @entity1 tied for last place on the list alongside the @entity56 diet , which is also a high - protein , low - carbohydrate approach			2
for the fourth year in a row , the @entity58 was named the best overall diet			1
@entity58 , or @entity61 , was developed by the @entity62 for people with high blood pressure			1
but it is also effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing a person 's risk for heart disease , stroke , kidney stones and diabetes , its website states			1
unlike many diet plans , @entity58 does n't cut out or extremely restrict certain foods			2
its focus is on limiting daily sodium intake			0
the meal plan includes three whole - grain products each day , four to six servings of vegetables , four to six servings of fruit , two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts / seeds / legumes			0
the diet 's only downfalls , the expert panel said , are that it takes some " grunt work " to adhere to , and that it may cost more than a diet based on " processed , fatty , sugary foods			0
" following @entity58 on the best overall list was the @entity98 , which also was created by the @entity62			1
next in line were the @entity100 , the @entity101 and @entity102 -- all tied for third place			0
this is the same as last year 's ranking			0
@entity2 also published several other lists , including best weight - loss diets , best diabetes diets , best commercial diet plans and easiest diets to follow			1
@entity102 topped the best weight - loss , best commercial diet plan and easiest to follow lists			1
also high on several lists were the @entity116 plan and " @entity118 " plan			0
