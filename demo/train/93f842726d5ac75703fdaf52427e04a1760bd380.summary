@entity0 -- @entity3 leaders on wednesday named fiscal conservatives for their six picks for a new congressional " super committee " charged with crafting a plan to reduce the country 's mounting deficits			1
in separate announcements , house speaker @entity10 and @entity12 minority leader @entity11 filled the @entity3 spots on the 12 - member bipartisan panel created in last week 's debt ceiling deal , passed by @entity18 and signed into law by president @entity20			1
@entity10 , @entity21 , chose reps			1
@entity23 of @entity24 , @entity25 of @entity26 and @entity27 of @entity26 , while @entity28 , @entity29 , picked sens. @entity30 of @entity31 , @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity34 of @entity35			1
all six are known for conservative stances on economic issues			0
@entity23 is the @entity39 chairman and will be co-chair of the panel with @entity43 sen. @entity42 of @entity44 , who was appointed tuesday by senate majority leader @entity45			1
" the debt crisis is a legitimate threat to our nation 's future , and the @entity54 people can not afford to wait any longer , " @entity23 said in a statement after his appointment			1
" everyone can agree that we must stop spending money we do n't have , and the time to act is now			0
" he added that the committee " will not be able to solve the crisis in a matter of months , but we can work together to tackle these challenges in order to bring back jobs , hope and opportunity for the @entity54 people			1
" @entity32 , despite his credentials of fiscal conservatism , noted wednesday that he recently voted to eliminate the ethanol tax subsidy and believed there were other subsidies or loopholes that could be ended as part of broad tax reform			1
many conservative republicans oppose any moves that could increase tax revenue			2
" the goal should be to broaden the base and lower rates so that we can create an environment that 's more conducive to economic growth , " he said			0
the committee will follow up on negotiations that started last year with the bipartisan debt commission appointed by @entity20 , then continued in @entity18 , including work by the so - called @entity88 senators -- three @entity89 and three @entity3			1
both the debt commission and the other group recommended comprehensive packages that included tax reform , changes to politically sensitive entitlement programs such as @entity96 and @entity97 , and spending cuts			2
@entity20 will bring " very specific ideas about " how " the committee could come together in a balanced way to significantly reduce the deficit , " @entity100 press secretary @entity99 told reporters wednesday			1
former @entity3 sen. @entity106 of @entity107 , who co-chaired @entity20 's debt commission , told @entity1 on wednesday that the new special committee has plenty of information to work with and should n't need a lot of time for further collecting or analyzing of issues			1
committee members " do n't need to sit around here and gather more information , " @entity115 said , adding that the actual negotiating is " going to be tough			2
" among the choices announced wednesday , @entity120 is the @entity123 chairman , while @entity27 chairs the @entity124			2
@entity27 has taken some moderate positions in the past , including attempts to decrease tax cuts in the @entity129 administration that remain contentious today			2
in a statement wednesday , @entity27 said that " much more needs to be done to bring down health care costs , promote economic growth and begin to tame runaway government			2
" " no one believes this is going to be easy , " he added			0
on the @entity12 side , @entity30 , the no. 2 @entity3 behind @entity28 , is a staunch advocate for the military , which is targeted for deep spending cuts if the special committee fails to come up with an agreement that passes @entity18 by the end of the year			1
@entity34 is a former @entity100 budget director in the @entity129 administration with a reputation for working with @entity89			0
his fellow @entity35 senator , democrat @entity145 , said wednesday that @entity34 " has shown a willingness to find common ground by looking at both tax reform and spending cuts in order to reduce the deficit			2
" @entity32 , elected to his first @entity12 term last year with the support of tea party conservatives , sits on the @entity156 and @entity155			1
he told reporters wednesday that he expected the special committee to begin its work soon , and that it would require republicans working with @entity89 to succeed			1
" it has to be an exercise in finding common ground between @entity3 and @entity89 , but it also has to be constructive with respect to reducing our deficit and it has to be pro-growth as well , " he said			1
a day earlier , @entity45 , @entity168 , appointed @entity169 , @entity170 of @entity171 and @entity172 of @entity173 as his three @entity12 @entity174 picks			0
@entity45 went with veteran legislators including a former @entity43 presidential candidate in @entity172 , the @entity177 chairman and the more moderate @entity170 , who chairs the @entity178 and has fought @entity3 efforts to privatize @entity96			1
@entity45 named @entity169 , a war critic and champion of benefits for military veterans , the co-chair of the special committee			0
in a joint statement after their appointments , the three @entity43 senators said that @entity54 want the committee to operate without " the red - hot partisanship and brinkmanship of the last months			1
" " this is not going to be easy			0
our challenge is to find common ground without damaging anyone 's principles			0
we believe we can get there			0
this committee was designed to require bipartisanship , and we are going to work hard with our @entity3 colleagues to attain it , " their statement said			1
@entity100 minority leader @entity203 , @entity204 , has yet to announce her three @entity100 @entity174 choices			2
she has until tuesday to complete the committee that will have six @entity89 and six republicans , equally divided between the @entity100 and @entity12			0
the committee will try to work out $ 1.5 trillion in deficit reduction , after an initial round of more than $ 900 billion in spending cuts in the debt ceiling agreement			2
it is required to complete its work by november 23			0
@entity18 then has until december 23 to vote on the proposal , with no amendments permitted			0
a simple majority on the panel -- seven of 12 members -- is needed to approve whatever package it comes up with , meaning that it will take a lone member of either party to push something through by voting with the other side			0
the committee 's proposal would then need a simple majority in each chamber of @entity18 to make it to @entity20 's desk			1
if the committee fails to reach agreement or @entity18 fails to pass whatever package it recommends , a trigger mechanism will enact further across - the - board cuts in government spending , including for the military			0
@entity99 said wednesday that @entity20 continued to call for a balanced approach that includes increased tax revenue , entitlement reforms and spending cuts			1
" and we are not alone , " @entity99 said			2
" the @entity54 people overwhelmingly support the balanced approach that the president supports			1
" according to a new @entity1 / @entity247 released wednesday , 63 % of respondents say the so - called super committee should recommend increased taxes on higher - income @entity54 and businesses , with 36 % disagreeing			1
by a 57 - 40 % margin , respondents say the committee 's deficit reduction proposal should include major cuts in domestic spending			0
however , further cuts in defense spending get a mixed review , with 47 % favoring them and 53 % opposed			0
nearly two - thirds of respondents oppose major changes to @entity96 and @entity97 , while nearly nine in 10 do n't want any increase in taxes on middle - class and lower - income @entity54			2
months of rancorous negotiations on deficit reduction have failed to resolve a fundamental dispute between @entity3 and @entity89 involving the size of government and whether to raise revenue while cutting spending			2
@entity20 is pushing for a comprehensive plan that includes spending cuts , increased tax revenue and entitlement reforms , while @entity3 seek to shrink government by proposing spending cuts and entitlement reforms without increased revenue			1
an impasse over the tax revenue issue led to the debt ceiling agreement , which imposed the initial round of spending cuts and set up the special committee to work out further deficit reduction			1
the agreement also enables the federal debt ceiling to be increased through 2012 , allowing the government to borrow what it needs to meet its obligations			0
the brinkmanship of the negotiations , with uncertainty over whether the government might default if no deal was reached , was one reason why @entity299 's downgraded the @entity54 credit rating from @entity301 to @entity302 + on friday			2
one of the main @entity3 arguments against tax increases for the wealthy is that they would inhibit job creation			1
the poll results showed that only a third of respondents agree with that stance , while 62 % say taxes on the wealthy should be high so the government can use the money for programs to help lower - income @entity54			1
the @entity1 poll was conducted by @entity247 from friday through sunday , with 1,008 adult americans questioned by telephone			0
the survey was conducted both before and after friday night 's announcement of the @entity299 downgrade			0
the poll 's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points			0
late tuesday , @entity325 chairman @entity324 slammed @entity45 's choice of @entity169 and asked the @entity12 leader to withdraw her appointment			0
" @entity45 's appointment of @entity42 to co-chair the @entity332 on @entity333 is absolute proof that @entity89 are not serious about deficit reduction , " @entity324 said in a statement			0
" as chair of the @entity337 , @entity169 is the @entity89 ' fundraiser - in - chief			0
the @entity332 is no place for someone whose top priority is fundraising and politics			0
" @entity1 's @entity344 and @entity345 contributed to this report .			0
