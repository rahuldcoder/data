the intercepted @entity1 communications that sparked the closure of @entity4 embassies in the @entity5 and @entity6 contained specific words that @entity4 intelligence interpreted as a coded message for what they believed signaled a potentially imminent attack , @entity13 has learned			1
the coded words directly pointed to the likelihood of a significant @entity1 attack against an overseas @entity4 installation , according to a @entity4 source familiar with the latest intelligence			1
however , the words did not give clues as to a specific location or target , which is what led to closing nearly two dozen embassies and other diplomatic facilities deemed to possibly be at risk			2
the @entity4 intelligence community had been monitoring @entity1 communications regularly , but was especially concerned about three intercepts			1
the first was from @entity32 , the leader of @entity33 , outlining a possible attack			0
another was @entity37 's response to that from his position as leader of the global @entity1 movement			0

" there have been bombings in many places in the world			0
innocent people have lost their lives			0

" separately , a @entity89 official told @entity13 that a recent drone strike did not injure suspected @entity33 bombmaker @entity91 contrary to an earlier @entity89 news agency report that said he might have been hurt			1
three suspects on @entity89 's list of its 25 most - wanted terrorists have been captured and two others killed recently , according to the official			1
