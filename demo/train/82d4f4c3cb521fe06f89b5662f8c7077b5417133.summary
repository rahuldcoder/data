it is the latest step in the reintegration process for @entity0 , who was held captive for five years and released in exchange for the transfer of five prisoners from @entity17			1

the program began at @entity4 in 2006			0
that 's where @entity0 arrived on june 13			2

several veterans and soldiers call him a deserter who walked off his base			0
an @entity11 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report			0
the @entity11 has no definitive finding that @entity0 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials could n't learn without talking to the soldier , a @entity63 military official told @entity69			1
