@entity24 , @entity25 : kicking off a new month of commercial - free news , i 'm @entity28 and this is @entity0 ! glad to have you with us			0
first up : @entity33 earthquake @entity34 : we begin in @entity33 , where officials are working to determine the full impact of a major earthquake			0
the difficulty is that the tremor , which struck around 5 p.m. local time yesterday , caused widespread power and phone outages			0
initial reports did indicate that the quake killed at least 75 people			2
officials believe hundreds more may be injured and thousands may be trapped			0
according to the @entity50 , the earthquake had a magnitude of 7.6 ; that 's what classifies it as a " major " quake			1
it struck about 33 miles from the capital city of west @entity57			0
scientists said they could n't speculate on whether it was connected to another deadly quake that struck in the @entity61 the day before			1
@entity62 @entity34 : that deadly tremor took place in the @entity65			0
officials say it claimed more than a hundred lives and flattened entire villages			0
president @entity70 has declared the situation a major disaster to help speed up aid efforts			0
some of the damage was caused by three tsunamis created by the quake			1
@entity77 explains how that happens			0
@entity79 , @entity80 : what happens is that the earth moves under the water , and when the earth moves , you start to push up or push down that part of the earth , eventually there 's going to be a wave get caused by that movement of the earth			2
there 's where it was			2
there 's @entity96 right there			2
it 's kind of an ugly mess			2
here 's how it happens : literally , there are two plates -- well , a number of plates -- but there are two plates that really were affected here in parts of @entity96 yesterday			2
gon na rewind you all the way back here , and i 'm gon na play it for you , and here it goes			0
one plate , the subduction plate , one plate on top begins to get crunched , and then kind of separated , and then all of a sudden , it 's that energy that is released all at one time			2
and it 's like the inverse of throwing a stone in a pond , but you get the same waves coming out of the middle			2
fast facts @entity126 , @entity25 : the @entity10 , or @entity10 , was created in 1957			1
its mission is to push for safe and secure nuclear technologies			2
part of the way it does that is by setting standards for nuclear safety and by inspecting nuclear facilities to make sure they 're being used for peaceful purposes only			2
dr. @entity137 leads the @entity10 , and in 2005 , the agency won the @entity139			1
@entity8 's inspections @entity34 : doctor @entity137 is weighing in on @entity8 's controversial nuclear program			1
he says the country does n't appear to be making nuclear weapons , but it did break the law by not telling the @entity10 about its newest nuclear facility before the thing was built			1
this all comes before today 's scheduled meeting where several countries , including @entity8 , are discussing the program			1
( @entity152 ) @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 : @entity137 's comments about @entity8 's controversial nuclear program much more tempered and even - handed than what we 've heard coming out of @entity160 and @entity161 these days			1
the head of @entity164 's nuclear watchdog coming out and saying two significant things			1
first off , mr. @entity137 saying that indeed @entity8 did break the law when it did not disclose this uranium enrichment facility earlier			1
mr. @entity137 saying @entity8 should have disclosed it during the planning stages			1
but he also added that the @entity10 has yet to find any evidence that indeed @entity8 is going after nuclear bombs			1
so , he basically gave both sides in this nuclear debate something to work with going into thursday 's talks in @entity175			1
here 's what mr. @entity137 had to say in an exclusive interview with our sister station , @entity181			2
director general @entity137 , @entity10 : i do n't think , based on what we see , that @entity8 has an ongoing nuclear weapons program			1
whether they have done some weaponization studies as was claimed by the @entity17 and others , this is one of those issues that is still outstanding			1
but i have n't seen any credible evidence to suggest that @entity8 is having an ongoing nuclear weapon program today			1
i hope that they are not having one			0
@entity195 : that was mr. @entity137 , saying he hopes @entity8 is not going after nuclear bombs			1
but it is the position of @entity160 and @entity200 leaders that they can no longer afford to hope			0
they need to be certain because they say @entity8 's leaders have lost credibility when it comes to the nuclear issue , and the only way they can be certain is if @entity8 curbs uranium enrichment and grants access to all its facilities throughout the country , whether they 've been declared or not			1
look for that to be a focal point in these landmark negotiations in @entity175 on thursday			0
@entity151 , @entity0 , @entity155			0
( @entity215 ) @entity216 @entity217 , @entity25 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity220 's geography classes at @entity221 in @entity222 , @entity223 ! who is the current @entity17 secretary of education ? is it : a ) @entity228 , b ) @entity230 , c ) @entity231 or @entity232 ) @entity227 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! education secretary @entity230 is responsible for overseeing the government 's education programs and policies			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity12 @entity34 : the @entity240 oversees those policies , but most decisions are actually made by state and local officials			2
that 's why secretary @entity230 is going around the country trying to convince those officials to get behind a plan that president @entity70 is pushing , which would change how long you guys spend in school			1
@entity251 looks at the potential pros and cons. ( @entity152 ) @entity254 , parent : so , we get an extra day ! @entity251 , @entity0 correspondent : it 's 3:00 in the afternoon , and @entity258 has just picked up his 10 - year - old daughter @entity260 from school , right in the middle of the work day			1
a longer school day for @entity260 , what president @entity70 wants , means a more convenient day for dad			1
@entity254 : it kind of works into our personal schedule			0
for example , i can then have the ability to pick my daughter up after school , as opposed to cutting my work day short			1
@entity276 : the idea is gaining steam			0
education secretary @entity230 is touring the country with unconventional allies -- the @entity281 and @entity282 -- encouraging local districts and states to embrace the idea of longer school days and a longer school year , saying the current system is outdated , a century old , when kids needed summers off to help on the farm			2
this is the right word			0
@entity276 : @entity230 says students who thrive are in class longer			0
@entity230 , education secretary : guess what ? they 're in school nine hours a day , they 're in school on the weekends , and they 're in school over the summer , and , you know , this is not a new idea			1
@entity276 : @entity96 students have one of the shortest school years in the world : 180 days , versus 195 for most @entity200 nations and 200 for @entity311 countries			2
and @entity17 students spend fewer hours a day in the classroom ; 35 hours a week			1
@entity315 students are in class 60 hours a week			0
the nation 's largest teacher 's union says more seat time is good , but after school programs at school ? better			1
@entity323 , @entity324 : we have them for mediation , we have them for enrichment , we have them for sports , we have them for art , we have them for music			0
those are really good things			0
@entity337 , student : four times four is 16			0
@entity276 : @entity258 is all for longer school days , but summers off ? @entity276 : some might argue longer school day , longer school year , could work to our advantage			1
@entity254 : i agree with that , but it 's difficult to make that cultural shift within our country on just an edict from the president			2
@entity276 : so , what does 10 - year - old @entity260 think about the president 's proposal ? @entity354 : well , longer school days usually means more homework , and for a lot of people homework can be very overwhelming in a way			1
@entity276 : something else that could be overwhelming : the cost			0
the @entity363 , a conservative group , says yeah , it all looks good on paper , but there are hidden costs involved , like potentially more money for teachers , higher electricity bills when you keep schools open longer			0
and who 's going to foot the bill ? probably taxpayers			2
@entity251 , @entity0 , @entity375			0
( @entity215 ) promo @entity34 : one day you definitely wo n't be in school : @entity379 ! so , after you 've gobbled up all your turkey , tune in to @entity382 ! the special program celebrates ordinary people who are working to make the world better			1
voting for hero of the year begins tonight after the top 10 heroes of 2009 are announced			0
you can find more information and our free educator materials " in the @entity395 " section at your favorite web site , @entity394 ! before we go @entity34 : finally , how can a car wash get away with not guaranteeing a clean car ? when the washer weighs a couple tons ! it 's all part of a new exhibit at a zoo in @entity403			0
sure , he does a good job with the water , but this has to be the world 's worst detailing job			0
come on ! the sponge is n't even touching the car ! the beastly buffers are thorough in their jobs			0
they hose down the entire car ... goodbye @entity34 : ... from hood to trunk			0
that was so bad , we should probably just pachyderm it in			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity28 .			0

understand how seismic events , like the @entity4 quake , can spawn tsunamis
hear the @entity10 's stance on @entity8 's nuclear program
consider the potential pros and cons of a plan to extend the @entity17 school day
