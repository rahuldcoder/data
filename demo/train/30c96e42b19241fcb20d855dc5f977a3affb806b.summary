-- a three - judge federal appeals court panel tuesday overturned a lower court 's order blocking key parts of a @entity6 law requiring doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion , potentially clearing the way for enforcement of the law			1
in august , just before the law was set to take effect september 1 , @entity15 district judge @entity14 in @entity16 , @entity6 , found several portions of the law " unconstitutionally vague , " and ruled it violated the @entity20 by compelling doctors and patients to engage in government - mandated speech			1
but a panel on the 5th @entity28 vacated @entity30 ' injunction against enforcing the law , saying opponents did not prove it violated the @entity33			2
the panel remanded the suit back to the lower court for further proceedings			0
as written , the law would require women seeking an abortion in @entity6 to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure			1
@entity30 ' injunction blocked @entity6 from enforcing any penalties against a doctor who failed to place sonogram pictures where a pregnant woman may see them , or does not make the fetus ' heartbeat audible			0
it also blocked penalties against the woman			0
a previous @entity15 @entity59 ruling in a @entity61 case " held that the fact that such truthful , accurate information may cause a woman to choose not to abort her pregnancy only reinforces its relevance to an informed decision , " @entity15 circuit judge @entity62 wrote in a concurring opinion			1
" insisting that a doctor give this information in his traditional role of securing informed consent is permissible			0
" " today 's ruling is a victory for all who stand in defense of life , " @entity6 gov. @entity73 said in a statement			1
" every life lost to abortion is a tragedy , and this important sonogram legislation ensures that every @entity6 woman seeking an abortion has all the facts about the life she is carrying , and understands the devastating impact of such a life - ending decision			1
" we will continue to fight any attempt to limit our state 's laws that value and protect the unborn , " @entity73 said			1
the suit was filed by the @entity96 - based @entity95			2
@entity97 , the center 's president and ceo , said the court decision was " extreme			0
" " this clears the way for the enforcement of an insulting and intrusive law whose sole purpose is to harass women and dissuade them from exercising their constitutionally protected reproductive rights , " @entity97 said in a statement			1
" until today , every court that has reviewed similarly intrusive laws have ruled the laws unconstitutional			0
" the law , she said , " serves only to place multiple hurdles between women and the free and full exercise of their reproductive rights			2
" the center , she said , is evaluating " all available means " to challenge the @entity6 law " and all laws that seek to undermine women 's fundamental rights			2
" the bill generated some controversy in @entity6 , but easily passed through the state 's @entity128 and @entity129 , both of which are controlled by @entity132			0
the law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed , women must undergo a sonogram , a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image			2
the doctor is required to give , " in a manner understandable to a layperson , a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images , including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus , the presence of cardiac activity and the presence of external members and internal organs , " the law says			0

new : abortion - rights group : law is " insulting and intrusive "
the ruling clears the way for potential enforcement of the law
gov. @entity73 hails the decision as a victory
