-- in a move that could reshape the @entity4 economy , the government on thursday announced a new law that allows for the sale of real estate			1
the @entity8 in august approved a plan to permit the sale of real estate , and the legislation itself officially was put on the books wednesday			1
it goes into effect november 10 , the state - run newspaper @entity14 reported			0
the new law allows for the sale , exchange , donation and gifting of real estate even in cases of divorce , death , or the owner leaving the country permanently			1
as stated , the goal of the law is to " eliminate prohibitions and make limitations ( to property ownership ) flexible			2
" the effect of creating a housing market in the stagnant @entity4 economy is uncertain			2
for one , the law places some limitations -- including a prohibition of the ownership of more than one residential home and one vacation home			1
also , only @entity4 citizens living in the country or foreigners with permanent residences in @entity4 may participate in the transactions			0
buyers will be required to swear under oath that they do n't own other property			0
under the law , in cases where the owner permanently leaves the country , the state confiscates the home and turns it over for free to any legitimate co-owners or family			0
@entity4 has a population of 11 million people and a housing shortage			0
it 's not unusual to find three or four generations crammed into a small apartment or divorced couples under the same roof			0
before the law , a black market for real estate existed , where houses were swapped .			1

a new law in @entity4 allowing some real estate sales goes into effect next week
the legislation is seen as a major *reform*
owners are limited to one residential home and one vacation property
