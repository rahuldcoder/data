-- a pillar of black smoke billowed over downtown @entity4 , @entity5 , after a train carrying crude oil jumped its tracks and caught fire wednesday afternoon , city officials said			1
between 12 and 14 cars from a @entity13 freight train were involved in the derailment , which occurred along the @entity15 and left oil burning along the river 's surface , city government spokeswoman @entity10 said			1
about 50,000 gallons of crude oil are missing from the tankers , she said			1
it 's unclear how much of the oil burned in the blaze and how much spilled into the water			1
buildings near the derailment were evacuated for several hours , and firefighters let the fire burn out on its own , she said			1
@entity29 was working at the @entity30 when he came out and witnessed the crash			0
" you just saw it going sideways on two wheels and then one went down , and the train just kept on coming , " @entity29 told @entity0 affiliate @entity32			1
" and then just a dogpile on top of that			1
" at least three tank cars fell into the river , a photograph taken at the scene showed			1
@entity4 police lt. @entity44 said the fire was contained , but still burning , four hours after the derailment			1
@entity13 said three of the cars caught fire after the derailment , the cause of which was n't known wednesday			1
" @entity13 is responding fully , with emergency response personnel , safety and environmental experts , community support teams and other resources on site and on the way , " it said			0
" we are committed to fully supporting the emergency responders and other agencies , meeting the needs of the community and protecting the environment			0
" @entity66 , a spokesman for the @entity67 of @entity68 , said it was " too soon to say " what the environmental impact of the accident would be			0
the spill was contained before it stretched more than a quarter of a mile downriver , he said , but it was n't clear wednesday evening how much oil had spilled into the @entity15			2
" we have people on the scene providing technical assistance to make sure the leak is contained properly , " @entity66 said			0
an oil boom in @entity81 and @entity82 has led to a fourfold increase in the amount of crude shipped by rail since 2005 , according to the @entity87			1
environmentalists and regulators have been paying more attention to those shipments since a july derailment and fire killed 47 people in a small town in @entity96			1
in march , environmentalists warned against having trains hauling oil from @entity81 's bakken shale pass through downtown @entity4 en route to a storage depot in @entity103			1
@entity104 , director of @entity5 's @entity106 chapter , said wednesday 's accident only heightens those worries			0
" this train track runs right through the heart of @entity111 , by the way			2
this could easily have happened in the heart of the capital city , " @entity113 said			2
he said it was n't clear whether the oil would burn off completely without leaving residues on the ground or in the river			2
" these are the questions that should have been asked before we started doing this , " he said			0
@entity127 , a spokeswoman for the @entity129 @entity128 , said @entity5 received just under $ 400,000 last year in @entity131 grants			0
she noted , too , that the department has held two all - day hazmat transportation training workshops in the state since september			0
the volume of oil spilled or burned was n't immediately known			2
the @entity87 and the @entity138 are sending investigators to the site , those agencies said			0
the @entity129 @entity142 was monitoring the air at the request of state officials , @entity142 spokeswoman @entity141 said			0
@entity146 said @entity4 's drinking water was n't affected by the spill			1
but in @entity111 , more than 100 miles downriver , authorities have begun drawing drinking water out of a separate canal rather than the @entity15 as a precautionary measure , said @entity153 , a spokeswoman for the city 's @entity154			2
@entity156 , director of the state @entity157 , said it would take three to four days for any oil that may have spilled to reach @entity111 , and it would be " very diluted " before it reached that point			2
other communities can bypass the river as well			0
" we 're not expecting any effects to drinking water , " @entity156 said			0
@entity0 's @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
