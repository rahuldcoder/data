@entity0 -- it was the art discovery that stunned the world : more than 1,400 works of art , many of them masterpieces , hidden away for over 70 years , unearthed not in a high - security vault or long - forgotten museum basement , but an anonymous apartment in an upscale @entity12 neighborhood			1
a vast stash of paintings by the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , some previously unknown , others that had been presumed lost forever			1
their worth is thought to be upwards of $ 1 billion			0
the cache was uncovered by @entity12 tax authorities who raided the property in the @entity29 district of @entity30 in february 2012 as part of an investigation into allegations of tax evasion , but its existence remained a closely - guarded secret until this week			0
as details of the paintings -- and claims they may have been looted by the @entity42 -- begin to emerge , one mystery remains : just who is the man behind this remarkable collection ? the apartment where the haul was hidden belongs to an 80 - year - old art lover named @entity49 ; he has long since vanished , leaving relatives and neighbors -- as stunned as everyone else by the contents of his outwardly modest home -- to piece together his story			1
they paint a picture of a solitary and enigmatic man , whose only love was art. " for me he was a ' lonesome cowboy , ' " says his cousin @entity62 , who last saw @entity49 more than 30 years ago , and now lives in @entity63			2
" he had no friends			0
the only thing i think that was interesting for him was his paintings			0
" @entity62 remembers @entity49 as " a very elegant man , " always impeccably turned out , carrying an ivory - topped cane , but always with an air of mystery about him			1
" he never let us in to his flat -- nobody , " he told @entity1			0
" when we met him we always met at some fancy place ... never in his flat			0
i wondered ... why ca n't we stay there , but ' no , no , it 's not possible			0
' read more : unknown @entity17 , @entity18 artworks in ' @entity83 - looted ' haul " so of course you think , ' he never lets us in , perhaps he has some secrets ... ' if you 're a mystery man people think all kinds of mystery things about you			1
" he says the family knew that @entity49 worked as an art restorer , but insists they had no idea about the treasure trove of paintings he had squirreled away			1
" we knew he was restoring paintings , but we thought maybe he had 100 or so ... paintings going in and out , so people did n't wonder , but nobody knew -- not even us -- that he had 1,400 - and - something pictures in his flat , in 90 square metres , imagine ! nobody had seen it because he did n't let anybody in			2
" according to land registry checks carried out by @entity109 and seen by @entity1 , the @entity29 apartment is n't the only property owned by @entity49 ; he and his sister @entity111 also own another home in a smart suburb of @entity114 , @entity115			2
art - obsessed recluse no one answered the door when @entity1 paid a visit to the house this week , but a neighbor said he has n't seen @entity49 for several years			1
he remembers a reclusive man , apparently obsessed with art. " he never greeted anyone and would just drive by , keeping to himself , " the neighbor told @entity1			0
" he always seemed grumpy and would never really be out in public ... he would always quickly retreat into his house and never really had any visitors			0
" while @entity49 appears to have lived a largely secret life for decades , his father @entity129 , who is thought to have amassed the huge collection of paintings , was well known in the @entity12 art world of the 1930s and 1940s			1
according to statements @entity136 gave to the @entity137 in june 1945 , he had been employed to buy art for the @entity42			2
previously , he 'd lost two jobs -- first as director of the city art gallery in @entity142 , eastern @entity143 , and then as head of @entity146 's @entity145 -- because of his partially @entity148 heritage			1
documents published on @entity150 , the website of the @entity152 on @entity153 1933 - 1945 , reveal that the allied forces confiscated more than 100 artworks from @entity129 in the aftermath of the @entity157			0
read more : art looted by @entity42 ' found in @entity12 apartment ' the pieces -- including works by @entity17 , @entity16 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 -- were later returned after @entity129 strongly denied holding @entity83 beliefs and insisted the paintings and other art objects were the legal property of his family			1
in a checklist which forms part of his statement to the @entity137 , @entity129 reports owning a @entity16 painting " bought from the artist " in @entity175 in 1942 for 60,000 francs , while a work by @entity18 was said to be an " old possession of my sister			1
" the 1945 inventory and other lists compiled by @entity129 when applying to reclaim his collection also include several pieces by artists condemned as " degenerate " by the @entity42 : @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			2
in statements backing his calls for the return of the works , several people wrote of @entity49 's interest in art forbidden under the @entity83 regime			1
in a letter dated march 1946 , @entity198 , director of the city art collection of @entity200 , in eastern @entity143 , reported that @entity49 " took the side of the condemned ' @entity203 ' and saved many a masterpiece of this kind by bringing it into private ownership			1
" @entity129 finally secured the return of his artworks in 1950 - 51			0
he died a few years later in 1956 , leaving them -- together with hundreds of other pieces -- in his son 's hands			2
@entity49 appears to have guarded the collection ferociously , keeping it out of sight for decades			2
" he could have sold them to a rich man , or made a foundation , or sold them to a museum , " says his cousin @entity62			0
" he had @entity16 , @entity185 , @entity18 , everything			2
he could have sold [ them ] if he was interested to make money ... " [ instead ] he 's said i am the one that has something unique that nobody has			0
not you and not you , and i 'm not prepared to show these treasures , all my treasures , all my babies			0
i do n't want to show it to anybody			0
