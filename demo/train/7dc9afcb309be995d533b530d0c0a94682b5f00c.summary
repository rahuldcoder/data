-- it was n't the best day for trekkers			0
after a successful online campaign that propelled " @entity9 " - the most well - known planet from " @entity11 " - to the top of a poll to name two moons orbiting @entity8 , fans found out on tuesday that the moons would be named " @entity13 " and " @entity14 " ( which placed second and third ) instead			1
the @entity17 explained that despite the popularity of " @entity9 " ( in large part due to a @entity21 campaign by " @entity11 's " own @entity22 and endorsed by castmate @entity23 ) , the name was not new to the world of astronomy			1
" the ( @entity27 ) gave serious consideration to this name , which happens to be shared by the @entity31 god of volcanoes , " @entity17 stated in a press release			2
" however , because that name has already been used in astronomy , and because the @entity31 god is not closely associated with @entity8 , this proposal was rejected			0
" ( @entity27 rules state that the moons must be named after characters from the underworld of @entity42 or roman mythology			0
) the name was given to a hypothetical planet , which was believed to exist near @entity45 , but that theory has since been discredited			0
@entity22 made no bones about his displeasure with the decision on his @entity21 feed			1
" i 'm sad , " he tweeted			0
" so they name a moon @entity52 because there 's already a @entity56 asteroid but a mythological planet knocks out @entity9 ? " he went on , " @entity11 fans have had it rough			1
@entity60 ( @entity61 ) blows up @entity9 and now @entity17 finds a loophole to deny it from coming back ! " whose tech is better : ' @entity11 ' or ' @entity65 ' ? he also said , " i think they used us for promotional purposes ! they 're probably @entity65 fans ! " " are you out of your @entity9 mind ? ! " tweeted @entity71			1
" my poor @entity8 does n't get its @entity9 moon			2
" however , others cheered the decision			0
" @entity80 for the preservation of astronomical history ! " wrote astronomer @entity77 , who is so famous for helping to downgrade @entity8 below planetary status that he goes by @ plutokiller on @entity21			2
in the meantime , the members of the band @entity14 were positively giddy			1
" @entity14 is proud to accept this new heavenly chart position as we add orbiting @entity8 to our ever expanding touring map , " guitarist and songwriter @entity85 told @entity87			1
" as always we have our fans to thank for it and i predict a new @entity14 t - shirt in the making ! " so there must certainly be mixed feelings for those who enjoy " the trouble with @entity97 " and " @entity98 " equally			0
@entity99 up ! scientists work to produce ' @entity11 ' deflector			0
