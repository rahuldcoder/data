@entity0 , @entity1 -- luge is a dangerous sport in which accidents happen			1
that was the refrain from athlete after athlete when asked how they felt about the death of @entity12 luger @entity11 , who was killed when he flew off the @entity14 track during training in @entity16 on friday			1
but luge athletes will be the first to tell you they are more driving technicians than adrenaline junkies , and when pressed about why they would participate in a sport that 's so dangerous , several concede they do n't consider the sport to be that risky			1
amidst the shock at the death of a young athlete , the fact has been lost that in the hands -- and feet -- of masters , luge is relatively safe			2
a 1997 paper in the @entity31 analyzed luge injuries between 1985 and ' 92 on the @entity33 , @entity34 , luge course , a track that sliders consider to be technically trickier , though slower , than @entity16			1
the conclusion was that luge on that difficult track is remarkably safe			2
with " injury rates comparable with recreational skiing , " the study says , " the sport of luge is quite safe ... despite the appearance of danger			1
" the study analyzed 57,244 runs by competitive , or training to be competitive , men and women from 12 - to 35 - years - old			0
the vast majority of those were bruises , scrapes and muscle strains			0
luge is rough on the back and neck muscles			0
during the seven years , a mere 10 injuries were serious enough , like a broken bone , to force the athlete to miss a week or more of practice			0
according to the study , athletes were more likely to get hurt away from the track while carrying their sleds than to suffer a major injury on it			1
the grand total of concussions recorded was 10			0
a six - year study of the @entity77 found , conservatively , that a concussion happened about every other game			2
because 16 games are played on the opening @entity77 weekend , concussions during pro football should surpass seven years of @entity33 luge in week 2 of the season			2
and never mind boxing , where athletes are occasionally killed , and the actual goal is to physically insult the brain of a competitor until he or she is unable to stand			0
it 's a discrepancy that @entity93 luge coach @entity92 , who was angered that the men 's race was moved to the lower women 's start after @entity11 's death , was quick to address			1
the speed of race cars is not reduced every time a professional driver crashes and dies , he said			0
for that matter , nor are speed limits on roads , where 37,261 people in the @entity106 died in crashes in 2008			0
that said , nothing would be wrong with reducing speeds at the @entity16 course ; the sport is just as exciting for fans at 80 mph as at 90 mph			1
as for the @entity33 luge analysis , study author dr. @entity114 , an orthopedic surgeon in @entity115 , @entity116 , said different tracks have different hazards			1
( @entity114 was a competitive luger himself , and said he never suffered a serious injury			0
) much was made of the @entity16 track being the world 's fastest after a @entity124 slider topped 95 mph on it last year			1
@entity11 was going 88 mph when he crashed			0
and yet , in the three years of its existence , the @entity16 track 's crash stats are in line with other tracks around the world , according to officials from the @entity135			1
out of more than 30,000 runs in the three sliding sports -- bobsled , luge and skeleton -- @entity16 has seen 340 crashes			2
lugers and coaches at the @entity14 said that they 've never seen an athlete fly off the course entirely , as @entity11 did			0
" everything came together at the same time , " said @entity146 , a @entity106 luger who finished eighth on sunday , " but there are places on every track where that could feasibly happen			2
" for another view , click here but it essentially does n't happen			0
this was a terrible , terrible , freak accident			1
@entity106 luge coach @entity157 says he has n't seen an athlete fly off a course in his 35 years in the sport			2
that is n't to say that the modifications in @entity16 -- the ice on curve 16 was shaved to make it harder for sleds to go up the wall , a new retaining wall was put in place and a lower start is being used -- are not perfectly prudent			1
perhaps retaining walls should be put along every curve at every track in the world			2
even the athletes who were upset at the change of their starting spots said the luge federation had to show the world how serious it is about safety			0
what happened to @entity11 was a tragedy so deeply affecting that athletes who should have been basking in the realization of their @entity14 dreams were frequently choking back tears			0
still , they agreed that the rush to see every luge run as a gambler 's game of life and death is a characterization that can only be made by those who started following the sport on that tragic friday			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity199 says @entity12 luger 's death at @entity16 track was a freak accident
@entity206 : @entity16 track has crash statistics that are in line with other tracks around the world
study of dangerous @entity33 track found sport " quite safe , " similar to skiing , he writes
that said , @entity206 says , modifications in @entity16 prudent ; reducing speed would n't hurt
