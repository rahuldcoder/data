@entity0 -- @entity2 has been skateboarding since he was 10 years old , yet he was caught off - guard by a question from the much younger salesman at his local skateboard shop			1
" are you going to skate this thing or hang it ? " the salesman asked him			2
" it sort of struck me as funny , " said @entity2 , 40 , who works as a designer in @entity0			1
" i asked the guy what he meant			0
the guy told me , ' are you going to skate it or hang it on your wall ? a lot of you old guys hang these up as artwork			0
' " the conversation gave @entity2 an idea : to create an art exhibit featuring more than 200 skateboard " decks " -- the board where the artwork is applied -- from eight artists			1
" it is a study of the evolution of skateboard art through the actual art itself and the technology used to apply the art on the skateboard , " he said			1
visitors to the skate it or hang it exhibit at the @entity41 can see how skateboard art has gone from simple line " tattoo " art to high - end illustrations and actual photography , and how the process is completed			1
@entity2 said the crowds coming to see the exhibit are from " all different walks of life , " a reflection of the inclusive nature of the sport			2
" skateboarding is not white kids or black kids or @entity60 kids			0
... everybody can do it , " he said			0
" you can go to a skate park and run into a guy 10 years older than me or 25 years younger , and that 's what i love about it			0
