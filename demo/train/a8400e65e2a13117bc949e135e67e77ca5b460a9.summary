-- the @entity7 " is fully functioning and will begin to process claims for emergency payment , " a statement from the agency said on monday , the same day @entity1 reported having paid out $ 399 million in claims to date			1
the independent group , headed by attorney @entity9 , who handled the 9/11 victims ' compensation fund , was established in june as part of an agreement between the @entity15 administration and @entity1 to facilitate processing of the personal and business claims from those affected by the @entity20 oil disaster stemming from the @entity22 explosion on april 20			1
@entity1 said last week that it was no longer accepting claims as the transition to the new entity was taking place			1
the oil giant , which said monday that it has written 127,000 checks to pay $ 399 million in claims so far , will continue to handle claims put in by government entities			1
@entity1 said monday that 27,000 claimants who filed paperwork have not yet been paid			1
according to the @entity7 statement , claims previously filed with the @entity35 have been transitioned to the new claims facility for review , evaluation and determination			1
however , claimants will be required to file new forms with the @entity7 to receive payments			2
@entity9 , who now controls a $ 20 billion escrow account established by @entity1 to compensate for damage , said in the statement , " i want to make sure the people in the @entity20 understand we will not let you go out of business or lose your home			1
the no. 1 priority of the @entity7 is to assist the people in the @entity20			2
" he added , " now that the claim centers are open and ready for business , the goal will be to get the emergency six month payment checks out the door , within 48 hours for individuals , after receipt of the claim form and sufficient supporting documentation and no more than seven days for businesses , after receipt of claim form and supporting documentation , and help people on the path to rebuilding their lives			0
" to date , @entity1 has funded $ 3 billion of the $ 20 billion total , ahead of its payment schedule			1
in a conference call sunday , @entity9 said he plans to be more generous than any court would be in determining payments			2
however , he said if potential claimants do n't like the offer the @entity7 makes , and believe they can do better , they can file suit -- although he does n't advise it			2
" it is not in your interest to tie up you and the courts in years of uncertain , protracted litigation when there is an alternative that has been created , " he said			0
@entity9 stresed on sunday that his facility is independent of both the government and @entity1			1
claimants can file online , by fax , by mail or in person			0
all 35 of @entity1 's claims offices will remain open , but will be staffed with newly trained workers with the goal of quickly and efficiently answering questions , @entity9 said			1
on monday , @entity9 is scheduled to hold three town hall meetings in @entity97			1
each site is also supposed to have people from the fund to help @entity97 file their claims and answer specific questions			0
the meetings are scheduled for @entity104 , @entity105 , and @entity106			0
claimants can receive between one and six months ' compensation without waiving their right to sue , @entity9 said			2
only those who file for and receive a lump - sum payment later in the year will waive their right to litigate			0
@entity9 said it is still being determined whether those people will be required to release just @entity1 , or other potential defendants , from lawsuits			1
he said determining eligibility in some cases could be tricky			0
the farther a person or a business is from the @entity20 , the less likely they are to be determined eligible			0
however , @entity9 said , proximity is only one factor that is being looked at			2
a shrimp processor located 100 miles inland that solely processes @entity20 shrimp would be one example of a case where other factors come into play , he said			0
" i do n't want to underestimate the importance of proximity to the @entity20 , but we 'll have to be looking at the nature of your industry and how dependent you are on @entity20 resources , " he said			0
" i 'm going to have to draw some tough lines , but i 'm hoping i 'll be able to enjoy the benefit of saying , ' if i have n't found you eligible , no court will find you eligible			0
' " @entity1 has done a pretty good job of claims payment in some cases , but has not been very effective in processing business claims , he said			1
under his purview , " they may not always like their answer , but they 'll get their answer within seven days			0
" he said he anticipates " a flood of early emergency claims " beginning monday , but hopes the tide may be lessened by claimants ' ability to file and track their claim processing online			2
he said he plans to be transparent about budgets and payments , even his own compensation			0
a summary narrative on how adjusters will process claims has already been made public			2
asked about @entity163 attorney general @entity162 's friday letter to @entity9 criticizing the claims process under the @entity7 , @entity9 again emphasized that the program is voluntary			1
@entity162 said the program appears to be less generous to @entity167 than the @entity1 claims process , but " appearances are deceiving , and that is not the case , " @entity9 said			1
he encouraged potential claimants to " test " the program and see how they will be treated			0
while @entity177 residents are applying for payments onshore , offshore @entity1 has renewed " fishing operations " on the sunken , crippled @entity181 oil well , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity175 said monday			2
as a prelude to permanently shutting down the well , crews are trying to withdraw drill pipe hanging below the bottom of the blowout preventer and remove it from the well , so they can then remove the capping stack that 's kept oil from leaking since july 15 and replace the old blowout preventer with a new one			1
retired coast guard adm. @entity192 , the government 's point man in the region , said @entity1 has determined there are three sections of drill pipe that need to be removed -- a main pipe and two shorter ones			0
the largest pipe is roughly 3,000 feet long			0
the government wants to preserve the removed pipe to use for study and possibly as evidence down the road			0
@entity205 , the rig drilling a second relief well as a redundancy measure , is completing preparations for its blowout preventer to be used on the @entity181 well , while the @entity211 -- the rig drilling the relief well expected to intercept the main well -- is standing by until that 's done			1
once the blowout preventer is replaced to mitigate the risk of pressure in the well , it will take about four days to drill through the relief well and intercept the main well , based on statements from @entity192			1
from that point , it will take another few days to permanently seal the well with mud and cement from below in what 's called a " bottom kill " procedure .			0

@entity1 says it has paid out $ 399 million in claims to date
@entity1 is doing prep work to replace the blowout preventer on the damaged well
the @entity7 process kicks off monday
chief @entity9 says he is operating independently and will be transparent and efficient
