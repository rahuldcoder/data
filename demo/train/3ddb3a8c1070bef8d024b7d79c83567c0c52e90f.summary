@entity0 @entity5 with a pizza - based plan for saving the eurozone , did so because he had an idea and the winnings sounded " very attractive , " he told @entity1			1

exiting the euro : as easy as pizza ? the competition was launched in october by @entity22 , the man behind @entity24 retail chain @entity23 , to try and find ways to deal with a collapse of the euro -- the currency tying together 17 @entity29 countries			0
the euro has been under intense pressure since @entity31 was forced to take a bail - out from its eurozone peers and the @entity34 almost two years ago			2
through his father @entity35 , @entity3 told @entity1 he had an idea to solve the euro crisis and also thought the prize money sounded " attractive			2
" @entity3 , the youngest entrant to the prize , proposed @entity31 should leave the euro , with the @entity31 people slotting their funds into a bank " exchange machine " and getting drachma -- the @entity31 currency before the country joined the euro in 2001 -- back			1
as @entity3 explains in his application , the bank then gives the euros to the @entity31 government and " all these euros together form a pancake or a pizza			1
now the @entity31 government can start to pay back all their debts , everyone who has a debt gets a slice of the pizza			1
" @entity3 noted the " clever part " of his idea was that the @entity31 people would not want to change their euros for drachma , because they know the currency would depreciate			2
however , if they hide their euros , @entity3 said they should be slapped with severe financial penalties			0
@entity22 : why @entity29 needs to think about a euro collapse @entity3 wrote : " in this way i ensure that all @entity31 bring their euros to a greek bank and so the greek government can pay back all the debts			1
i hope my idea helps you ! ! ! ! " @entity74 said he was proud his son thought about the world 's problems and came up with solutions			0
however , @entity3 told @entity1 he plans to be a zoo director rather than an economist , because he loves animals			1
he also wants the euro to continue			0
a list of the @entity85 finalists and their plans can be found here			0
