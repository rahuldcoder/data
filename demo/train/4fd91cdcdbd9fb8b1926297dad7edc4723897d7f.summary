-- @entity1 died , aged 82 , almost exactly 23 years to the day a car accident in @entity3 left him paralyzed from the waist down			1
i wonder what @entity1 scholars might make of that			1
i wonder , too , what achebe himself might have made of that , in his final moments			0
i 'm trying to imagine what went through his mind in those moments			0
would he have pondered , for one last time , on the inauspicious beginnings of his bestselling novel , " @entity17 ? " ( he once said that @entity21 , the publishers of the debut edition " printed very , very few			0
it was a risk ... it went out of print very quickly			0
" ) would he have mused on the fact that " @entity17 " never appeared in @entity27 , the @entity3 language that fed its style , and rhythms , and that its characters spoke ? would his mind have been crowded by violent images from @entity3 's civil war of 1967 to 1970 , in which he lost friends , his library , and any illusions he may have had about the unity and inherent goodness of @entity3 ? or by violent images from the 1990 accident ? would he have preferred to die in @entity3 , instead of @entity41 ? would he have chuckled at the thought of the @entity3 government unleashing a torrent of tributes -- the same government that suggested in 2004 ( under another president , it must be said ) , in response to his criticism of it , that he did n't deserve the country ? would he have tried to imagine how his life might have played out had @entity54 and the accident not happened ? we will never know			1
watch @entity1 interview : @entity59 's man of letters the war has been written about extensively -- @entity1 's final book was a much - awaited memoir of the war			1
the accident , on the other hand , is the tragedy that is not much talked about -- perhaps because @entity3 is an accident - factory			1
the title of @entity3 author @entity74 's @entity76 - winning novel " @entity84 " comes from a @entity78 poem , " @entity83 , " a 1967 lament for the victim of an accident on a @entity3 road : " may you never @entity71 / when theÂ road waits , @entity69 famished			1
" @entity1 's accident happened in @entity86 , in southeastern @entity3 , not very far from his birthplace			1
@entity3 's hospitals could not take care of him , and soon after he had to be moved to a hospital in @entity91 , where he was told he would never be able to walk again			1
in the eight years before the war @entity1 published four novels , but after the war it took him 17 years to publish another			1
after the accident he never walked again			0
and never had the chance to live in @entity3 again			1
and never again published a novel			0
" i have found that i work best when i am at home in @entity3 , " he told the @entity101 in a 1994 interview			2
when the magazine asked if he missed @entity3 , he said : " yes , very much			2
" but coming back was not an option : " one reason why i am quite angry with what is happening in @entity3 today is that everything has collapsed			2
if i decide to go back now , there will be so many problems -- where will i find the physical therapy and other things that i now require ? " more achebe : father of @entity59 literature that anger -- triggered by the @entity54 civil war , and crystallized by his accident , and the continued failings of @entity3 's successive governments to bring real change to the country -- defined his relationship with @entity3			1
things were always falling apart between the writer and his country			0
in 2004 , the government chose to offer him a national honor			0
not surprisingly , @entity1 rejected it			1
in response the government described his decision as " regrettable			0
" seven years later , the government -- this time under a new president -- tried again			0
again , @entity1 said no , arguing that " the reasons for rejecting the offer when it was first made have not been addressed let alone solved			2
it is inappropriate to offer it again to me			0
" and yet again the government described his action as " regrettable " and hoped he would " find time to visit home soon and see the progress being made by the @entity147 for himself			0
" that same government will now arrogate to itself the position of " mourner - in - chief			0
" someone ought to let them know that the biggest tribute they can pay to @entity1 would be to create the kind of @entity3 he would have been proud to receive a national honor from			1
and for @entity3 everywhere , the biggest tribute we can pay to @entity1 would be to get more familiar with his oeuvre ; read his writing with the passion with which we revere his person			1
read also : @entity1 was a talent and moralist i must confess i came to his work rather late			1
@entity167 has spoken eloquently of reading @entity1 at 10 , and having her life transformed from that moment			2
i came to @entity1 much later -- i did n't encounter " @entity17 " until i was in my mid- 20s			2
i love his essays and short stories the most -- essays full of wisdom and wit , and without the urge to impress with scholarly intelligence ; stories marked by an expertly wielded lightness of touch , and the most compelling characters you will ever meet			0
and it occurs to me that the novel i 'd most love to write would be a 21st - century update of @entity1 's final novel , " @entity187 " ( 1987 )			2
i got an opportunity to see @entity1 in person in november 2010 , when he went to speak at @entity190 , @entity91			1
it was an opportunity to see for myself the sort of reverence @entity1 inspired			2
" i think all you need to tell the stories that i have told is to live the life that i have lived and keep your eyes and senses open and working , " he once said			0
but that was the humble , self - deprecating @entity1 , the man who insisted he never taught creative writing because , " well , i do n't know how it 's done			1
" what he did took more than just open eyes			0
it took vision , a certain way of seeing the world			0
he was a genius , laden with -- to borrow from his own description of @entity167 -- " the gift of ancient storytellers			1
" may his soul rest in peace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity1 was a genius , laden with ' the gift of ancient storytellers , ' writes @entity216
@entity1 twice rejected awards from the @entity3 government
anger triggered by civil war , government failures , defined his relationship with @entity3 , says @entity216
@entity216 : ' we should ' read his writing with the passion with which we revere his person '
