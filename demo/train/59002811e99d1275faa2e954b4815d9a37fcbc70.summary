-- members of the nation 's oldest black sorority have accused the organization 's president of using her sorority credit card for personal items and its board of directors of spending too much on her			1
@entity11 president @entity10 denies the claims in the lawsuit against her			1
the suit alleges that the @entity11 's board of directors signed off on spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on president @entity10 and commissioned an expensive wax figure of her			1
@entity10 denied the allegations , saying they are " without merit			0
" the most " outlandish representation " in the lawsuit , she said , is the allegation that the sorority spent $ 900,000 on a wax figure of her			1
two wax figures -- one of @entity30 and one of the sorority 's first president , the late @entity32 -- were purchased by the hostess chapters of the sorority 's centennial convention last year , not the national @entity11 organization , for a total of $ 45,000 , @entity10 said			1
the lawsuit says the sorority 's board of directors approved the use of $ 900,000 for the wax likeness of @entity30 ahead of the centennial celebration			1
@entity44 , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , acknowledged that the sorority disputes the lawsuit 's account of the statue 's price tag			2
however , he said , " we have no way of knowing what the actual number was			0
we hope that it was as little as they say			0
" he added that $ 45,000 is still a large amount of money , although , " certainly , it 's a lot better than $ 900,000			1
" he called the alleged conduct " shocking and bordering on illegal			0
" the wax figures are to appear in the @entity63 in @entity64 , @entity65 , according to @entity11			2
the museum said they are on a traveling exhibit			0
the lawsuit , filed last month in a @entity70 superior court , also accuses @entity10 of using her sorority credit card for " designer clothing , lingerie , jewelry , gifts and other excessive and inappropriate expenses of a personal nature			1
" it demands that the sorority fire @entity30 and the board of directors and that the alleged damages be repaid			2
the lawsuit says that by using her credit card for personal purchases , as well as for " properly reimbursed expenditures , " @entity10 amassed @entity86 points , which she then redeemed for a 46 - inch television and gym equipment			1
it also says that the sorority 's board of directors had agreed on compensation for @entity30 without the approval of the sorority 's policy - making body			2
the compensation , it says , included a $ 4,000 - a - month stipend that @entity30 is to receive for four years after she leaves office			0
the board of directors also voted to buy a $ 1 million life insurance policy for @entity30 , a purchase that was also not approved by the policy - making body , the lawsuit says			0
" allegations about personal use of @entity11 funds are false and unsupported by the organization 's audited books , " she said			1
the " malicious allegations leveled against @entity11 by former leaders are based on mischaracterizations and fabrications not befitting our ideals of sisterhood , ethics and service			1
" the lawsuit also blames @entity30 and @entity122 , the executive director for the organization 's corporate office , for financial decisions they made for the sorority			0
the sorority 's claimed deductions on its federal tax returns in 2006 and 2007 were " unreasonably large and inappropriate , thus exposing the sorority to potential @entity134 claims and obligations , " the suit says			2
furthermore , the sorority 's policy - making body has not approved @entity30 's investment philosophy , which " has caused the shifting of several million dollars of the sorority and foundation funds from cash and cash equivalents to stock and bond investments			0
" @entity10 said in her statement that under her leadership , " accounting and budgetary practices have been tightened , erasing past @entity134 liabilities and cost overruns			0
" in addition to @entity30 , @entity158 and the sorority , the lawsuit names other members of the board of directors and the @entity155 as defendants			2
