-- sitting in a meeting at @entity4 's @entity3 on monday afternoon , i heard the news that @entity6 had died			1
she was important to everyone in that room -- mostly space scientists and @entity4 officials			0
but for a handful of women like me , she was an irreplaceable leader			1
@entity6 , first @entity13 woman in space , dies @entity6 was n't the first woman to go into space , or to want to do so , much less the first woman qualified to do so			1
she would have been the first to tell you that			0
but as the first @entity13 woman in space , on @entity23 , the seventh flight of @entity13 's new space shuttle , she was the first woman astronaut most @entity13 knew about			1
and she used that fame for good			0
the first woman in space was @entity28 , a @entity29 cosmonaut whose pioneering flight took place only two years after her colleague @entity32 became the first man in space			2
at @entity4 , in contrast , there was a 20 - year gap between human ( male ) space flight and @entity6 's historic flight			1
@entity40 : @entity6 's first launch confirmed ' women could achieve their dreams ' her giant step for womankind happened two decades later than it should have			1
that 's why it was so important , especially for those of us women trying to succeed in male - dominated arenas			2
as @entity23 blasted off in 1983 , i was finishing up my doctorate in physics -- astrophysics , to be more precise -- just as @entity6 had done a few years earlier			1
most of my classmates were men , and i often felt out of place			0
whether she shared that sense of being an outsider or not does n't matter -- the important thing was that , thanks to her notoriety as a @entity4 astronaut , i found out about one more precious role model , someone in whose steps i could hope to follow			0
( ok , not the astronaut part -- i am far too chicken for that			1
) ride made success seem attainable , even in the men - only world of physics			0
born in 1951 , @entity6 , like all women her age , grew up in a @entity13 led by men , where it was major news if a woman became a pilot , ran for political office or headed a @entity86 company			1
she was part of a wave of accomplished women who broke through the barriers			1
ride was one of the first six women accepted by @entity4 for astronaut training in a class of 35 selected in 1978			1
they were all pioneers , but after the @entity23 crew was announced , @entity6 's name became a household word			1
share your tributes to @entity6 the press attention at the time was relentless , but she weathered it with evident calm			1
for a student like me , it was empowering to see such a talented , poised , accomplished woman take on this challenge -- one of the " first woman this - or - that " breakthroughs i had dreamed about as a child			0
one of @entity6 's astronaut classmates , @entity116 , became the first @entity13 woman to walk in space			1
in 1984 , @entity116 and @entity6 were crew mates on the @entity121 flight , @entity6 's second time in space			1
both flights were on the @entity124			0
ride was training for her third shuttle flight when the @entity124 exploded , on january 28 , 1986			0
that led to a three - year moratorium on @entity4 human space flight			0
@entity6 served on the @entity4 board investigating the challenger disaster , then left @entity4 in 1987			1
for her , the bloom must have been off the space shuttle rose			0
@entity6 opens a new frontier for others ride could easily have rested on her laurels			2
instead , she took on the great challenge of science literacy , especially for girls			1
she had gotten her doctorate in physics at a time when few women did so			0
she knew firsthand the joy of doing science and the satisfaction of helping advance knowledge			0
that must be one of the reasons she worked toward a world in which other women were encouraged to do science , not pushed away			2
@entity40 : @entity6 inspired me to dream in 2001 she started a company , @entity158 , that runs science camps and daylong festivals for middle school girls as well as trains science teachers			1
@entity158 is a partner in the @entity165 , a camera on @entity4 's @entity167 satellite now orbiting the moon , the first @entity4 flight project dedicated fully to education and public outreach			0
her company is also involved with @entity173 on the @entity174			0
the " @entity179 " in both names stands for knowledge acquired by @entity176 -- that was @entity6 's grail			2
light years : tributes pour in for @entity6 in the early 1960s , as @entity4 was selecting the @entity184 to be @entity13 's first astronauts , several dozen @entity13 women underwent similar evaluation , in secret			1
a group of women later known as the @entity184 13 , including some of the finest aviators of the day , passed the same grueling physical and psychological tests as the @entity184 7			0
according to @entity192 , author of " the @entity184 13 : the @entity196 and the @entity197 , " some of the women scored better on the tests than their male counterparts of the @entity184 7			0
but none was ever accepted by @entity4 for training			0
unlike @entity6 , the names of the women pilots and would - be astronauts are not widely known today : @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 , @entity204 , @entity204 , @entity211 , @entity204 and @entity212			1
some 40 years later , happily , they have been celebrated as pioneers and recognized with awards such as the @entity217 's women in @entity219 award in 2005			2
i suspect these women appreciate the recognition but would rather have done what ride did			0
they would rather have flown in space			0
news : memories of my space flight with @entity6 still , 343 hours in space was n't all that ride was about			2
her true passion was opening doors for younger women , so they can follow their interests and talents without restrictions			1
today , middle school students at @entity158 learn the excitement and fun of science , the thrill and the challenge			0
@entity6 got to walk that walk in a big way			2
her legacy is that other women do , too			0
share your tributes to @entity6 with us on @entity40			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			2

@entity252 : for a handful of women , she was an irreplaceable leader
she says @entity6 was part of a wave of accomplished women who broke through barriers
