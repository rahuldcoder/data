-- when 3 - year - old @entity3 fell ill with complications from cystic fibrosis , his parents did what any loving parents would do			0
@entity8 and @entity9 put their lives on hold to see their son through his medical travails			1
surgery after surgery , hospital after hospital , they remained by their child 's side as he fought to recover			0
this past march , at age 4Â½ , @entity3 lost his battle with this terrible disease			2
following the indescribable anguish that comes with the death of a child , @entity8 and @entity9 might have hoped to resume their jobs and begin the process of moving forward with their lives			1
what should have been a private and quiet period has instead been marked by a mountain of medical debt , home foreclosure and bankruptcy			1
like three - quarters of the families driven to bankruptcy by health - related costs , the @entity3 family had health insurance when @entity3 became ill. in fact , through a combination of employer - provided insurance , @entity46 coverage and state - sponsored care , the vast majority of @entity3 's medical expenses were covered			2
but to be by their son 's side during his treatments , @entity3 's parents both took time off from work			1
with their reduced income , it was impossible for them to make ends meet			0
according to a recent study by researchers at @entity66 and published in @entity67 , medical costs , including lost wages , copays , deductibles , premiums , coverage limits and uncovered expenses , contributed to more than 62 percent all personal bankruptcy filings in 2007			1
these costs can bankrupt even those with health insurance they thought was solid as a rock			2
as @entity74 moves forward with long - overdue legislation to improve and expand health insurance coverage , we should help the millions of @entity77 drowning in medical debt get a fresh start			1
by ensuring that the vast majority of @entity77 have access to affordable health insurance , the broad health care reform legislation being debated in the @entity81 will reduce the number of bankruptcies caused by medical debt			1
even so , uncovered expenses such as lost wages can drive people to bankruptcy			2
the @entity91 would make it easier for those with high levels of medical expenses to discharge their debt and move on with their lives , by lifting unnecessary and burdensome procedural requirements for people who become insolvent because of unavoidable health costs			1
for example , under the current system , a prospective bankruptcy filer must complete credit counseling , a requirement that includes a fee and is geared to people whose irresponsible spending led to bankruptcy			2
for @entity8 and @entity9 , the counseling was a cruel reminder of their loss			1
they were unable to , and should not have had to , answer the question : what could you have done differently to avoid your financial hardship ? to add to the heartlessness of this nonsensical , government - imposed obligation , the credit counseling was an online program			0
a person would have seen how inappropriate it was to be asking that question			0
in addition , the proposed legislation -- which has been offered as an amendment to the larger health care bill and also is pending before the @entity127 as a stand - alone bill -- would give the medically bankrupt increased flexibility in paying attorneys ' fees and a greater chance of retaining their homes			0
the bill , which would cost the taxpayers nothing , does not propose a bailout or handout			0
it would merely adjust the current bankruptcy rules to make the process less expensive and more accessible for those on the verge of losing everything because of uncontrollable medical expenses			0
we hope that @entity74 will swiftly approve this common sense dose of compassion			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 and @entity151 .			0
