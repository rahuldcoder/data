-- @entity2 boxing history reveals that it is a sport that has traditionally been the " bluest " of blue - collar athletic endeavors			1
it has always held out the promise -- despite the odds -- of advancement for young men with the talent and guts to succeed in an often bloody undertaking , beginning with the arrival of the @entity13 in the mid- 19th century , and for african - americans and the later influx of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , whether @entity2 - born , from @entity19 or from the @entity20			1
three of the earliest success stories in this history were men of @entity25 - @entity2 heritage from @entity26 : @entity27 in the 1880s ; @entity29 , the first latino to medal in boxing in the @entity32 , in 1924 ; and @entity33 , @entity35 champion in three divisions during the 1920s			1
these men challenged the notion that @entity41 - surnamed men were not good athletes with the physical capability and mental acumen to succeed in corporeal competition			0
in subsequent decades , @entity46 continually proved themselves worthy in the boxing ring and on the baseball diamond , the football field , the basketball court , and elsewhere			1
little by little , as economic and educational circumstances improved during the years following @entity54 , such athletes came to represent local communities , and a few competed at the professional level			0
while the world of sport did come to recognize talent of @entity18 participants , many female athletes continued to be shortchanged for most of the 20th century			0
in recent decades , the playing field has been leveled substantially , in part due to @entity65 -- the 1972 law that increased opportunities for women in high school and college athletics -- and a series of court decisions			1
still , there remain barriers -- economic , educational , familial , and cultural -- to increasing the percentage of @entity46 participating in athletics			0
my recent work documents the struggles that young women confront as they seek opportunities to play soccer and other sports in @entity84 communities that have seen an explosion in their @entity18 populations in recent decades			1
many of these young women are keen to share in the triumphs and joys of athletic competition on behalf of their hometowns			0
some even aspire to earn athletic scholarships that assist their families in paying for college , but their hopes are often checked			0
@entity98 , a @entity99 boxer vying for the @entity32 , follows the tradition of other @entity18 athletes who broke barriers			0
they compete for their own success and glory , but also enter the boxing ring or take to the field for other @entity46 who will never vie for professional titles			1
their stories exemplify two key issues affecting our nation 's future : first , the demographic transformation of small town @entity2 , and second , the role of sport as a vehicle to break down barriers between " new arrivals " and their neighbors			2
as @entity98 and other @entity46 gain acceptance in " nontraditional " sports , the path for young girls in small towns gets a bit easier			2
the success of @entity129 at a national level demonstrates the possibilities that participation in sport can have for this generation			0
a chance to compete on the basketball court and soccer field can open entirely new social and academic prospects for young women			2
and by wearing the name of their school on their jerseys , @entity99 athletes are seen as local heroes who are accepted by the general populace			0
just as @entity17 - @entity2 reveled in the triumphs of @entity147 and @entity148 , likewise it is conceivable that a greater sense of pride , acceptance , and community may result from @entity46 bringing fame to their hometowns through their on - field exploits			1
@entity98 is in the vanguard of what we can expect from @entity99 athletes in the future			0
her successes will open doors for young women who will grasp the opportunity to compete in athletics and in our nation 's classrooms			2
what could be more @entity2 than that ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 says boxing in @entity2 has long been chance for advancement among *immigrants*
he says it lets @entity25 - @entity2 show mettle , become source of pride in communities
@entity65 helped open opportunity to women too ; *olympic* hopeful @entity187 one example
@entity190 : for @entity46 , especially " new arrivals , " a chance in sports helps them join community
