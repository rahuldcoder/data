-- the @entity1 are talking a lot this week -- perhaps you 've heard a little something about an independence referendum -- and that makes us happy			1
that 's because we like how the @entity1 talk			1
not necessarily what they say -- just the way they say it			2
imagine the way your @entity1 pals might pronounce " pour " and " poor			1
" the @entity1 accent is like no other			1
then again , neither is any other accent			2
it 's estimated that there are nearly 7,000 languages on earth			1
that 's nearly 7,000 different ways to traipse clumsily through the @entity28 language -- or to sex it up like an old @entity32 song			1
of course , no accent is sexy when it 's strong enough to crush a beer can			2
which means not all accents are created equal			2
you choose : hottest accents all of this got us talking this week about which accents we like most			2
so we decided to hold a vote of our own -- a @entity45 poll to ask which accents you prefer			2
( @entity47 has charged to the front at the time of writing			2
you can cast a vote via this link : : on.fb.me / @entity54			2
) below is the list of sexiest brogues we came up with by deploying an admittedly unscientific methodology -- meaning we asked around the office , which does at least account for more nationalities than colors in the @entity63 universe			1
our also - rans included @entity65 ( as appealing as warm @entity66 's to some , tantalizingly exotic to others ) and @entity69 ( the language of repressed salarymen is also strangely designed for pillow talk )			1
feel free to state your objections and / or rain your accolades in the comments section below and vote in our @entity45 poll			1
because when it comes to accents , there are no absolutes			2
except that the one that makes you cringe is absolutely horrible			0
you know which one we 're talking about			0
@entity87 famous tongues : @entity89 , @entity90 a historical refuge for @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 , the hyper - libidinous @entity96 melting pot of @entity87 has cultivated a proud , pouty tone			1
with its own pronunciation of @entity102 letters ( " ll " sounds like " shh " ) and its own words ( " you " is " vos " ) , this is a dialect that 's hard to get			0
( or at least plays that way			0
) sounds like : a tightly tuned guitar of g - strings strummed by a lamb shank 12			1
@entity113 famous tongues : @entity115 , @entity116 with five tones comprising their native speech , the traffickers of this often fragile accent turn any language into a song of seduction			1
@entity113 is largely monosyllabic , so multi-beat foreign words get extra emphases right up until the last letter , which is often left off , leaving the listener wanting more			0
sounds like : r - rated karaoke 11			1
@entity47 famous tongues : @entity131 , @entity132 for fetishists of oddball sexuality , the @entity134 island of @entity135 offers an undulating , melodic gumbo of pan-african , @entity143 , @entity102 , @entity141 and @entity142 dialects that , when adapted for @entity28 , can be sex on a pogo stick			1
sounds like : a rubber life raft bobbing on a sea of steel drums 10			0
@entity151 @entity150 famous tongues : @entity153 , @entity154 perhaps owing to its freedom from @entity143 influence , the @entity151 @entity150 accent has a more colorful , puerile flair than its coarser @entity160 counterpart			1
the resulting yowl of drawn - out vowels reveals a flirty freedom of spirit that suggests a permanent vacation			1
sounds like : the near , then far , then near again hum of a low - wattage vacuum cleaner that runs on dance sweat 9			1
@entity171 @entity170 famous tongues : @entity173 , @entity174 there 's nothing sexy about being in a hurry , and you could clock the growth rate of grass with the honeyed drawl of a @entity170 beau or belle			0
sounds like : molasses taking a smoking break 8			0
@entity1 @entity189 tongues : @entity190 , @entity191 some of the vocal strangulations heard echoing around @entity193 are registered as a danger to shipping , but in less industrial corners of @entity1 melodic voices capable of ranging a full octave in a single " aye " tumble like soft rain on warm bagpipes			1
these are gentle , knee - melting tones that conjure cozy firesides and beguiling knitwear before their sudden swing to reproach leaves us whimpering for more			1
sounds like : a stroked tartan cat 7			0
@entity212 famous tongues : @entity214 , @entity215 valued slightly more in men than in women , the @entity212 brogue is a lilting , lyrical articulation that 's charming , if not exotic			0
fluid and uplifting , it can swing from vulnerable to threatening over the course of a sentence , restoring your faith in the world again ... right before it stabs you with a broken bottle top			0
sounds like : a marauding pixie 6			0
@entity231 famous tongues : @entity233 , @entity234 dignified , with just a hint of willful naivete , the deep , rich " oh 's " and " eh 's " of @entity231 bend the @entity28 language without breaking it , arousing tremors in places other languages ca n't reach			1
sounds like : the @entity244 intro with teeth 5			0
@entity246 's @entity28 famous tongues : @entity248 , @entity249 authoritative			1
few accents promise the upward nobility of the @entity246 's @entity28			1
it 's a take on the language that sets hearts devoted to @entity258 and @entity259 aflutter			0
and , should the speaker fail to slake your most wanton desires , eh , at least you 'll learn something			0
sounds like : a crisply ironed shirt playing a harp 4			0
@entity267 famous tongues : @entity269 , @entity270 like @entity273 , without the nettlesome history of brutal , iron - fisted despotism , @entity267 is a smoky , full - bodied vocal style that goes well with most meats			2
murky and mysterious , the @entity277 tone is equal parts carnal desire and carnival roustabout			0
sounds like : @entity282 , secret agent 3			0
@entity102 famous tongues : @entity284 , @entity285 sensual and beckoning , but with the passion to unleash hell kept just barely restrained , @entity286 is like a dialectic @entity289			0
but then there 's the lisp			0
tender , vulnerable and cute as a baby 's hangnail -- no one owns the " th " sound formed by tongue and teeth like those who speak the language of @entity301			2
@entity302 : an outboard motor on @entity304 2			0
@entity143 famous tongues : @entity306 , @entity307 the come - hither condescension and fiery disinterest of the @entity143 tongue remains paradoxically erotic			1
sounds like : a 30 - year - old teenager 1			2
@entity93 famous tongues : @entity314 , @entity315 raw , unfiltered , the @entity93 accent is a vowelgasm that reflects the spectrum of @entity93 experience : the fire of its bellicose beginnings ... the romance of the @entity324 ... the dysfunction of anything resembling a government since @entity327			1
insatiable , predatory and possessive , this is sex as a second language			0
sounds like : a @entity333 saxophone which is your favorite accent ? leave a comment and vote in our @entity45 poll			0
