do you hate it when your mint gum makes your ice water taste too cold ? or your phone charger wo n't reach your bed ? a group fighting for access to clean water in developing nations has created a fundraising video that takes such first world gripes and casts them in the stark light of poverty			1
in the 60 - second video , the group @entity14 has impoverished residents in @entity17 , the poorest nation in the @entity18 , recite tweets from the popular hashtag # @entity20			1
the hashtag , a perpetual presence on @entity24 , pokes fun at people who have more than the basics of life covered , and yet grumble when , say , their neighbor blocks off his wi - fi access			1
in the video , " @entity31 , " a man outside a dilapidated tin - roof house says " i hate it when my house is so big , i need two wireless routers			2
" a young girl near a stream where women are washing clothes adds : " when i leave my clothes in the washer so long they start to smell			0
" another scene shows a boy sitting on the concrete steps of an unfinished cinder block house			0
his " gripe " ? " when i have to write my maid a check , but i forget her last name			0
" @entity55 , " the text at the end of the video reads			2
" donate to help bring clean water to those in need			1
" the lack of safe drinking water is the world 's single largest cause of illness , according to @entity64			1
and @entity65 says that waterborne disease around the world this year will kill 6,500 people a day			1
" we 're not setting out to humiliate people who have used the # @entity20 hashtag , " said @entity69 , the chief creative officer of the ad agency @entity70 , which created the video			2
" rather , the project encourages people to think before they tweet			0
there are much more important problems in the world than not getting a hot - enough latte in the morning			2
" the video has racked up more than 1.7 million hits in less than month			2
and the campaign may be having the desired impact			0
" i used to think that first world problems were hilarious , but now i just feel ﻿ bad			0
" says a comment posted under the video on @entity88			0
another person laments : " okay ( it 's ) true ﻿ i am a self centered stubborn brat			0
i have no idea how good i have it			0
" ultimately , the clean water group is trying to benefit from a @entity24 - inspired guilt trip			1
" people are becoming desensitized to suffering and we needed to enter the social space with a provocative approach to get those who are lucky enough to have simple things such as water , food , and shelter to reflect on their 140 characters and support causes like @entity65 , " said @entity96 , the executive director of the nonprofit .			1
