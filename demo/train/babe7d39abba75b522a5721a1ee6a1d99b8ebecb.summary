-- one volunteer woke up every morning with a sigh , relieved that no one had murdered him in his home the night before			1
another expected a bullet from a sniper whenever she strolled down the street			2
and one young woman was so petrified after an encounter that she urinated on herself in public			2
we 've heard about the inspirational side of the civil rights movement : the rousing marches , freedom songs and electrifying speeches			1
but these recollections come from a group of civil rights veterans who sound more like combat soldiers who once lived in constant terror			1
that 's part of the power of the new documentary , " @entity28 , " which premieres tuesday at 9 p.m. on @entity27			1
the " @entity30 " film captures the idealism that inspired an interracial group of college students to journey to @entity35 for 10 weeks in the summer of 1964 to register @entity38 - @entity37 voters			1
but it also reveals what happened when that idealism collided with the casual brutality of white @entity35 who saw @entity28 as a " nigger communist invasion			1
" a terrifying warning " there is no guarantee that you will get out of this summer alive ; just know that , " @entity48 , a @entity28 organizer , told volunteers after learning that three of their colleagues had been killed			1
there have been plenty of films on the violence of segregationist @entity35			2
yet " @entity28 , " directed by @entity58 " genius grant " fellow @entity59 , goes deeper			1
@entity59 unearths rare film footage , interviews former segregationists , and persuades some @entity28 veterans to tell stories they had never before shared in public			1
still , what may be most striking about the film is not what is said but what is implied			1
@entity59 captures the idealism of an era in @entity37 that seems as distant as covered wagons			1
ordinary @entity37 believed they could change the world			2
most @entity28 volunteers were only 19 or 20			1
they had heard president @entity76 's challenge to " ask what you can do for your country			2
" they saw themselves as patriots			2
" it was terrifying , " @entity83 , a former volunteer , says in the film			1
" but if you cared about this country and you cared about democracy , you had to go			2
" the paranoia of white @entity35 @entity89 was on life support in the @entity35 of 1964			2
almost half the state 's residents were black , but only 6 % were registered to vote			2
in some counties , blacks made up 70 % or more of the population but were barred from voting through a combination of literacy tests , economic intimidation -- they could lose their jobs , homes or land for registering to vote -- and raw violence			2
it may seem odd today that the white power structure in @entity35 was willing to be so brutal just to keep people from voting			2
the film , though , shows that the whites ' brutality was driven by an apocalyptic fear : black voters would drive them from office , and from the state			1
some had other fears that had nothing to do with politics			2
they seethed with fury after seeing white college women , who came to @entity35 for @entity28 , interact with black men and live with black families			1
one white volunteer recounted how segregationists were obsessed with interracial sex ; one sheriff even asked her to describe the size of big black men 's penises			1
" we face the absolute extinction of all we hold dear , " @entity35 gov. @entity129 thundered during a speech at the time			2
" we must be strong enough to crush the enemy			2
" a brush with death the goal of @entity28 , though , was to do more than register black voters			1
it was to empower blacks as well			2
the volunteers established @entity140 where they taught black @entity35 about black history			2
they established an interracial delegation to the @entity143 that made a daring , nationally publicized bid to unseat @entity35 's all - white delegation			0
some of the most powerful segments in the film , though , come during its smaller moments : a burly white sheriff viciously tries to snatch an @entity37 flag out of the hands of a small black boy leaving a courthouse ; the boy bravely holds on while he 's swung like a rag doll			1
a former beauty queen from @entity35 recounts how family members were driven from their homes simply for having dinner with @entity28 volunteers			1
a boy photographed being educated in a ramshackle @entity163 explains how that summer changed the arc of his life ; he is now a poised college professor and author			0
one of the film 's most riveting moments comes when volunteer @entity169 tells a story that , until then , she had been too embarrassed to share			1
@entity169 was walking alone on a @entity35 road one day in her summer dress when a group of laughing white men drove up , surrounded her , and told her they had n't killed a white girl yet			0
the men grabbed her , tied a noose around her neck and tied the noose to the car			0
then they started to drive , forcing her to keep up while calling her " nigger lover			0
" as they sped up , @entity169 says , she thought she was going to die			0
the men then stopped , untied the noose from the car and laughed as they drove away			0
@entity169 stood alone in the road petrified			0
" i peed all over myself , " she says , her voice shaking years later			0
" i just stood there and peed			0
" who were the true heroes ? despite the courage of people like @entity169 , most of the volunteers say today that the true @entity28 giants were the black @entity35 they worked with			1
most of the students would eventually return to college , but the black residents remained to contend with the wrath of segregationists -- many for the rest of their lives			0
@entity204 , one of the @entity28 volunteers , remembers one such couple			1
he recalls seeing an elderly black man and wife pull up to a courthouse in a mule - driven buggy			0
the man climbed out , walked up to a set of courthouse steps ringed with white deputies , and asked where he could register to vote			0
" i 'm haunted by the question of what happened to them , " @entity204 says			0
" i know they caught hell			0
those to me were the heroes			0
" @entity204 caught hell as well			0
he was with @entity223 , the head of @entity35 's @entity224 , on the day @entity223 was murdered in front of his home			0
@entity204 also knew one of the three civil rights workers who were killed that summer			1
at the funeral for one of the slain workers , @entity204 broke down publicly while delivering remarks , shrilly shouting , " i 'm tired of going to funerals			0
" @entity204 says some of his black colleagues from @entity235 -- the @entity235 , which organized @entity28 -- had worked virtually alone in @entity35 for three or four years before white volunteers joined them that summer			1
" no one felt like he was going to make it out alive , " he says			1
not only did virtually all the @entity28 volunteers make it out of @entity35 alive , they were alive in a way they had never been before			1
the experience transformed them , made some of them more radical			0
many of them had learned to some extent what it felt like to live as a minority			1
they had to stay with black families that summer and listen to their instructions to remain alive			1
" they could n't step out of the black community , " says @entity59 , director of " @entity28			1
" " they could n't go downtown			0
they got the hateful looks that black people get all the time			0
they had people driving by screaming stuff at them			0
they got a view of race that very few white people get			0
" the momentum generated by @entity28 led to the passage of the @entity267 , which removed all the barriers whites had erected to discourage black voters			1
last year , a conservative majority on the @entity37 @entity272 voted to gut a key provision of the @entity267			0
since 2011 , 14 states -- including @entity35 -- have passed voter id laws , according to the @entity276 , a public policy institute in @entity277			0
critics say such laws discourage minorities , the poor and elderly from voting			0
@entity59 , who has directed other @entity27 films such as " @entity283 , " says many of the @entity28 volunteers see history repeating itself with the recent @entity272 decision			1
" everyone feels horrible about it , " @entity59 says			0
" everyone is so upset			0
" some @entity28 veterans have organized voting seminars in an effort to maintain the victories they earned 50 years ago			1
but some of those victories ca n't be erased by any court decision			0
@entity297 , a white @entity28 volunteer from @entity298 , said though he went @entity299 to help black @entity35 , they ended up helping him more			1
he witnessed acts of courage from poor black @entity35 that stay with him today			0
and he saw a side of @entity37 that few white people see			0
" i sincerely hope that i made some small difference in moving the movement forward " he says			0
" but i do n't have any doubt all these years later that the person who benefited the most from my being in @entity35 was me			0
