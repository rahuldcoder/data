-- there 's an idea at play in this rampant idiocy , as well as considerable risk			2
in trying to introduce a new generation to the slapstick art of the @entity8 , directors and co-writers @entity11 and @entity12 do it the hard way			1
instead of a standard biopic that might explain how a 1930 's vaudeville act called the @entity8 -- brothers @entity18 and @entity20 and their friend @entity21 -- made their @entity23 mark with nearly 200 short films that featured the boys slapping , poking and punching each other senseless , the @entity15 decided to hit the 2012 multiplex with a trio of @entity8 shorts set in the present			1
kids know the short clips on " @entity32 , " do n't they , even if they never caught the @entity8 online or dvd			1
and besides , audiences with short attention spans are bigger than ever			0
and if the @entity15 could n't cast their movie with lookalikes , they would find three actors willing to be silly putty in their mischievous hands			0
and so , to play @entity21 , skilled clown @entity41 ( " @entity43 " ) transforms himself by shaving his head down the middle , letting prickly tufts of @entity21 - like hair protrude on the sides			1
as baldy boy @entity20 , " @entity51 's " @entity49 steps up with the needed rolypoly charm			1
and to play @entity18 , the bossy ringleader of @entity54 domination , there 's @entity56 - born @entity55 with a bowl cut and @entity59 accent ( " @entity61 " ) that is @entity18 to the life			1
once @entity62 had designs on playing @entity21 , as @entity64 had on @entity18 and @entity65 on @entity20			0
but @entity41 , @entity49 and @entity55 do themselves and the @entity8 proud			1
the movie is a mixed bag			1
a theme runs through all three shorts			1
the @entity8 , abandoned at birth at a @entity73 orphanage , must now save the place from being closed in an economic turndown			2
they need $ 830,000 to save the kids and the nuns , including @entity78 ( @entity79 playing a straight man ) , @entity81 ( @entity83 model @entity82 ) , @entity84 ( @entity86 winner @entity85 ) and , most memorable of all , @entity87 ( @entity88 in full drag and crankier than ever )			0
the plot gets overcomplicated when the villainous @entity91 ( " @entity93 's " @entity92 ) , offers to pay the @entity8 what they need to off her nerd husband , @entity95 ( @entity96 ) , a former orphan himself			2
the actors deserve a full - throated woo - woo - woo ! but the gags do n't blossom with repetition			0
the @entity8 were always better in short doses			2
and 90 minutes of @entity102 nyuk - nyuk - nyuk can seem like an eternity			0
even when @entity18 hooks up with the cast of " @entity106 , " this century 's bottom - feeding purveyors of lowbrow comedy , the jokes grow stale			0
for the @entity15 , " @entity111 " is a labor of love			2
for non-believers , it 's merely a labor			0
