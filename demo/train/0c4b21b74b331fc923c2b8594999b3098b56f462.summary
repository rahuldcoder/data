-- first , it was babies in bars			0
now , children in fine - dining restaurants are feeding a raging debate			1
the argument is fueled by new efforts of some @entity11 - starred @entity10 restaurants like @entity12 and @entity13 to cater to the under - 3 - year - old crowd			0
not every patron of expensive restaurants desires to share a formal dining experience with young children who may be more interested in playing with their food than savoring it some are upset at the parents of the young diners , but others believe that even adults do n't always behave in ways that allow customers to enjoy peaceful dining			2
more than 100 people -- mostly against the idea of tots at upper - echelon restaurants -- posted their heated comments in response to @entity39 's recent @entity38 piece , " @entity40			1
" " people who force their toddlers on others in enclosed public spaces like fine restaurants ( and airplanes ) are even more selfish than those who insist on talking on cell phones in such places , " one @entity38 reader said			1
" if you object to ' howls ' ( based on your ridiculous presumption that all children inevitably howl ) , let 's start by excluding all the adults who are yelling into their cell phones , are drunk and / or obnoxious , etc. " another commenter said			0
" i 'm with the majority -- thanks for this list , because now we know which high - end restaurants we will never set foot in , " another said			0
@entity66 's 50 best restaurants list that 's certainly the customers ' standpoint , but what about those manning the stoves and host stands ? many chefs and restaurateurs with families are teaching their own children to be good restaurant citizens and are making accommodations for kids in their establishments			1
@entity82 , chef and judge on the @entity85 's " chopped " series , created children 's menus at all three of his @entity10 restaurants so his two children , ages 3 and 5 , have dining options on their nights out			2
at @entity100 , adult diners can enjoy @entity82 's foie gras terrine or roasted marrow bones while their booster - seated offspring have the option of ordering orecchiette ( a type of pasta ) , grilled lamb chops , peanut butter and @entity98 sandwiches or petit filet mignon			0
@entity108 , executive chef of @entity11 - starred @entity109 and a father of three ( including a newborn ) , is even more accommodating			1
chef @entity112 : do n't fear fine dining " when my own children are in the restaurant , i 've sent them soufflé crackers with what looks like little frogs ' tongues			1
i 've sent out a beet dressed as a mouse , " @entity108 told @entity0			2
@entity108 also works with a @entity10 public school , @entity123 , offering lessons in table manners to first - graders			1
there are also hands - on cooking activities , a tour and lunch at his restaurant , as well as visits to the greenmarket , an open - air farmers market -- all experiences geared toward establishing a fundamental understanding of where food comes from			2
" they 're very impressionable and starting to form their opinions about food			0
we want to impress upon the kids that food is fun , " @entity108 said of the program			2
teachers in the program particularly focus on younger diners developing a " restaurant voice , " teaching children that restaurants are a busy place and that certain manners differ from when one is out playing tag in the park			1
this notion is especially poignant at @entity109 -- which @entity108 will admit is a fine dining establishment -- as there wo n't be stroller valet any time soon			1
" it 's not a restaurant adapted to children ; it 's a group of people who are warm and welcoming , " @entity108 said			1
the haute tots are , after all , children -- with an average attention span of three to five minutes per calendar year of their age			0
@entity108 says he has invited particularly antsy adolescents back into the kitchen to focus their attention after they have created a disturbance			0
" as with any performance , practicing before a big event , such as going out to a restaurant , is a good idea , " advises @entity175 in " @entity176 " in a chapter on @entity178			0
" i know of people who dress their kids up , sit them down at the family dining room table and hand out homemade menus to practice eating out			0

some patrons at fine restaurants are not *pleased* with sharing space with *disruptive* children
debate is raging after a @entity38 article
@entity109 chef @entity108 works with local school
