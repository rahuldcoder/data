@entity7 federal police patrol last week on the streets of @entity12 , just across the border from @entity13 , @entity14			1
@entity7 's military and police have been embroiled in increasingly violent clashes with drug cartels , which are battling among themselves for control over an ever - growing market in the @entity9			1
rep. @entity21 , chairwoman of the @entity22 holding the hearing , said thursday that what 's happening in @entity7 is becoming a growing problem for the @entity9			2
" well , it certainly has always been a problem at the border , but in the last couple of decades , it 's gotten even worse			0
now we see some spillover , just a little bit , coming into the @entity9 , " she said on @entity0 's " @entity29			0
" " i think it 's time that we make a comprehensive plan to figure out , not just what we do about the violence at the border -- but it 's all tied together with the economy down there , with our economy , ... commerce routes between the two countries			2
" @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 hearing on border issues focuses on violence and the transfer of guns from the @entity9 to @entity7 to arm the cartels			1
@entity21 said it 's a crime to sell some of the guns from stores within the @entity9 and traffic them to @entity7			2
most of the gun stores selling these weapons , she said , are within a mile of the @entity9 - @entity7 border			1
@entity21 suggested looking at what types of guns are being sold in those stores and perhaps instituting some provision against assault weapons			2
on wednesday , vice president @entity66 talked about drug - related violence in @entity7			1
" since the beginning of last year , there have been nearly 7,000 drug - related murders in @entity7			2
if we had said that years ago , we would have looked at each other like we were crazy , " he said			0
" violent drug trafficking organizations are threatening both the @entity9 and @entity7 communities			1
" @entity66 made those remarks as he announced the nomination of @entity78 as the new @entity2 drug czar , a position that plays a key role in developing and implementing the @entity83 border strategy			1
last year , more than 1,600 killings occurred in @entity12 , three times more than the most murderous city in the @entity9			0
and last month , the city 's chief of police was obliged to quit after threats from organized crime to kill a policeman every day that he remained on the job			0
on tuesday , five human heads were found in ice chests in the central @entity7 state of @entity97 , police said			2
growing drug violence has made beheadings in @entity100 , @entity12 and other @entity7 towns more commonplace over the past year			1
in recent weeks , the @entity9 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 have issued alerts about travel to @entity7			0

additionally , this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008			0
" @entity119 on wednesday told regional newspaper reporters that he would consider sending the @entity121 to the border if the situation escalated			1
" we 're going to examine whether and if @entity121 deployments would make sense and under what circumstances they would make sense , " @entity119 said , according to @entity124			1
" i do n't have a particular tipping point in mind , " he told the reporters			0
" i think it 's unacceptable if you 've got drug gangs crossing our borders and killing @entity9 citizens			0
" the president said he did not have any interest in " militarizing the border			0
" " we expect to have a comprehensive approach to dealing with these issues of border security that will involve supporting [ @entity7 president @entity147 ] @entity146 and his efforts , " @entity119 said , according to @entity124			1
" our expectation is to have a comprehensive policy in place in the next few months			0
" @entity119 and @entity153 chairman adm. @entity152 on saturday discussed how the @entity9 military can assist @entity7 in addressing growing violence from drug cartels , according to a military official			1
