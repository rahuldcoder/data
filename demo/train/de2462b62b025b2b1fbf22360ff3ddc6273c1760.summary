@entity0 -- @entity2 has agreed to hold formal talks with its southeast @entity5 neighbors about establishing a " code of conduct " to ease maritime tensions in the @entity8 , a major step forward in the long - running dispute			1
a statement issued after a weekend meeting of foreign ministers from the 10 - member @entity15 ( @entity15 ) and @entity2 in @entity17 , said the countries " aim to reach a conclusion of a @entity19 in the @entity8 , which will service to enhance peace , stability and prosperity in the region			1
" the @entity8 is home to messy mix of rival territorial claims , with @entity2 , @entity17 , @entity27 , the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 disputing sovereignty of island chains and nearby waters			1
the areas in dispute include fertile fishing grounds and potentially rich reserves of undersea natural resources			0
@entity40 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? however , analysts said the move was unlikely to yield a quick fix for one of the region 's biggest flash points			1
@entity49 , @entity50 at the @entity51 in @entity52 , said that it was a " positive development " and a code of conduct was urgently needed as @entity2 steps up its law enforcement patrols and military exercises in the @entity8			1
" it also provides substance to @entity52 's rhetoric that its relations with @entity5 countries remain a foreign policy priority , " she said			0
" but this is only a first step , and there is a long way before an effective code can be developed and implemented			0
@entity52 has a record of suspending talks as soon as tensions with rival claimant countries flare -- precisely when talks are most needed			2
" @entity2 has previously stated that it wishes to deal bilaterally with disputes in the @entity8 but a multitude of domestic problems , and the headway the @entity74 is making in the region as part of its " pivot " to @entity40 , means @entity2 's new leaders have decided that now is not the time to press issue , @entity49 added			1
speaking to @entity15 foreign ministers on monday , @entity74 secretary of state @entity85 said he supported a " substantive " code of conduct to deal with the overlapping territorial claims			2
his predecessor , @entity90 , repeatedly emphasized the need for a multi-lateral solution to the problem			0
" as a pacific nation , and a resident power , the @entity74 has a national interest in the maintenance of peace and stability , respect for international law , unimpeded lawful commerce and freedom of navigation in the @entity8 , " @entity85 said , according to the @entity94			0
" as we have said many times before , while we do not take a position on competing territorial claims over land features , we have a strong interest in the manners in which the disputes of the @entity8 are addressed , and in the conduct of the parties			2
" friction between @entity2 and the @entity28 has intensified this year following several naval standoffs , with @entity117 challenging @entity52 's claims to waters off the @entity28 at an international arbitration tribunal			0
@entity121 , senior follow at the @entity123 in @entity124 , says a code of conduct is a way to manage , not solve , the dispute and @entity2 is likely to drag out talks			1
it has already asked for the formation of an " experts committee " to advise on the drafting on the code of conduct that could slow negotiations , he added			0
" even at the end of the process , the final agreement is unlikely to be this formal , binding , effective and robust agreement that people are hoping to see			0
