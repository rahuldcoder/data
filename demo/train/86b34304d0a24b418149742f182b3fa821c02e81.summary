-- @entity1 says a new software update provides tools to get rid of the so - called " flashback " virus that has infected hundreds of thousands of @entity6 computers			1
in a post on its support forums , @entity1 said the update to the @entity15 software platform " removes the most common variants " of the @entity12 malware			1
last week , a @entity17 security company reported that as many as 600,000 @entity6 , most of them in the @entity20 and @entity21 , had been infected by @entity12 , a trojan horse virus that infiltrates computers , secretly giving someone else remote access to them			1
flashback was first discovered in september , disguising itself as an @entity27 installer			1
@entity1 recommended the new update to all @entity6 users who have @entity15 installed			1
throughout their history , @entity6 have been relatively free from most of the viruses and other malware that have targeted pcs , with cybercriminals preferring to go after the larger number of computer users on that system			2
but the rise of @entity6 has also seen an uptick in the number of @entity6 users targeted			0
" malware authors have targeted the @entity45 for quite some time ; however , the recent @entity48 infections indicate a very significant shift to the current threat landscape , which is dominated by malware on the @entity53 operating system , " web security firm @entity42 posted on its blog			1
@entity42 estimates that the number of computers still infected is down to about 270,000 , slightly less than half of the number that was reported a week ago			0
@entity1 , which prides itself on keeping a safe environment for users , was criticized in some quarters for the amount of time it took to respond to @entity12			0
" better late than never ? " wrote @entity64 of @entity65 on friday			0
@entity64 was more complimentary of the fix itself			0
while previous updates have closed the loophole that allowed the malware , the latest fixes the damage and is designed to protect @entity6 from similar attacks in the future			2
" kudos to @entity1 , " he wrote			0
" it may be late to the game when it comes to helping users remove the flashback malware from @entity81 , but it has raised the bar for proactively protecting systems at the same time			2

@entity1 releases update to fix damage from the " flashback " malware
security firm estimates up to 600,000 @entity6 were infected by the trojan horse
some *complained* @entity1 took too long to address the *problem*
flashback was discovered in september , disguised as a @entity98 installer
