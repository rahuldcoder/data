@entity0 , @entity1 -- a whale trainer at @entity4 died from " multiple traumatic injuries and drowning " after a 12,000 - pound killer whale grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at @entity12 , the @entity13 said thursday			1
@entity19 , 40 , was " pulled underwater for an extended period of time , " by the whale , @entity14 , @entity4 's curator of zoological operations , told @entity2 's " @entity21			1
" the county medical examiner ruled @entity19 " most likely died from multiple traumatic injuries and drowning after one of the park 's killer whales pulled her into a pool behind @entity12 , " the sheriff 's office said in a statement			1
the statement confirms @entity14 ' account , saying that @entity19 was interacting with the whale , named @entity33 , in knee - deep water " when the animal grabbed her by the hair , said to be in a long ponytail , and pulled her underwater			1
" rescuers were not immediately able to reach @entity19 because of the " whale 's aggressive nature , " the sheriff 's office said			1
she was recovered by @entity4 staff members after @entity33 was coaxed into a smaller pool and lifted out of the water by a large platform on the bottom of the smaller tank , authorities said			1
@entity51 : watch tourist 's video seconds before whale attack " while this incident remains the subject of an ongoing death investigation , there are no signs of foul play , " the sheriff 's statement said			2
" all evidence and witness statements indicate that the death was a tragic accident			0
" earlier accounts varied on how @entity19 ended up in the tank			2
a witness told @entity2 affiliate @entity70 that the whale approached the glass side of the 35 - foot - deep tank at @entity12 , jumped up and grabbed @entity19 by her waist , shaking her so violently that her shoe came off			1
a @entity4 employee , who asked not to be identified , described the incident the same way			2
@entity13 spokesman @entity79 said @entity19 slipped into the tank			2
@entity33 has been linked to two other deaths			1
he and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a @entity86 , @entity87 , marine park in 1991			2
the trainer fell into the whale tank at the @entity90 @entity86 and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched			1
in 1999 , @entity33 was blamed for the death of a 27 - year - old man whose body was found floating in a tank at @entity4 , the apparent victim of a whale 's " horseplay , " authorities said then			1
the @entity13 said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed , then climbed into the tank			0
the 22 - foot - long whale was " not accustomed to people being in his tank " and " would n't have realized he was dealing with a very fragile human being , " @entity102 said at the time			2
@entity109 : photo taken moments before @entity4 incident because of @entity33 's history , as well as his size , trainers did not get into the water with him , @entity14 told @entity2			1
specific procedures were in place for working with him , he said , although " obviously , we need to evaluate those protocols			0
" " he 's just a really , really large animal , " @entity14 said , noting that female killer whales weigh 6,000 pounds -- half of @entity33 's weight			1
" just because of his size alone , it would be dangerous to get in the water with him			0
" but the whale 's previous incidents were also taken into account , he said			0
@entity14 pointed out that the 1991 incident occurred before @entity4 owned @entity33 and that no one is sure what took place in the incident eight years later			1
@entity33 could have been trying to play with @entity19 or get her attention or companionship , said @entity137 , a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years			1
such whales play with seals and sea lions in the wild , tossing them in the air , she said			0
but they do not kill them and end up letting them go			0
" i do n't believe the killer whale purposely intended to kill the woman , " she said			1
" it was more likely an accident , i would guess			0
" but , she said , the whale could also have been frustrated for some reason			0
@entity14 said there were no indications of any problem with @entity33 or any other animal just before the incident , and that @entity19 " had done a great session with him ... he seemed to enjoy what he was doing at the time			1
" the incident , however , raises larger questions regarding the captivity of wild animals			0
a spokesman for @entity167 called the death " a tragedy that did n't have to happen			0
" @entity170 said the organization had called on @entity4 " to stop confining oceangoing mammals to an area that to them is like the size of a bathtub , and we have also been asking the park to stop forcing the animals to perform silly tricks over and over again			2
it 's not surprising when these huge , smart animals lash out			0
" @entity137 told @entity2 that killer whales in the wild live in family groups , and males stay with their mothers their entire lives			0
family members rely on each other for social structure and play , and they cover hundreds of miles of ocean , she said			0
" i think they do need more space , and situations like that do cause a lot of stress for them , most likely			0
" she said @entity33 had a " flopped fin , " something seen in captivity but not much in the wild			2
but @entity14 said , " we have a tremendous track record with these animals at @entity4 " and a very small percentage of problems			2
it 's useful to have animals in the park , he said , because it gives scientists a chance to study them and gives members of the public an opportunity to see them and learn about them			0
" this is the first time in 46 years that we 've ever had an incident like this with a trainer , " he said			0
although @entity33 is large and has to be handled carefully , " to mark him as a killer is unfair			1
" in 2006 , a trainer at the adventure park was hospitalized after a killer whale grabbed him and twice held him underwater during a show at @entity12			1
@entity2 's @entity228 and @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
