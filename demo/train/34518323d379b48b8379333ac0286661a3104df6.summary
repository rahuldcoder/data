@entity0 -- rather than celebrating @entity3 on sunday afternoon , @entity2 marched with several thousand people to take a stand against the @entity7 's controversial " stop and frisk " policy			1
" i feel it every single day , practically , " said @entity2 , who works as a teacher in the @entity9			0
" i 've been pulled over and pushed against fences , frisked , but have never been arrested			0
" @entity2 's story sounded familiar to many of sunday 's marchers , who want to see action from mayor @entity16 , and police commissioner @entity17 -- either by abolishing or reforming stop - and - frisk			1
last year , nearly 685,000 people were stopped by officers in cases that ended with no meaningful charge , according to police department statistics			1
of these , 87 % were @entity25 or @entity26 , the police department says			1
" they profile me because i 'm a rastafarian and i have dreadlocks , so therefore i get pulled over just for my looks , " said @entity2			0
sunday 's silent march started at @entity32 and headed down @entity33 , ending at 78th street after passing @entity35 's townhouse on 79th street			0
" i do n't know a single black or @entity26 male who does n't say he is basically afraid to be out on the streets , " said the rev. @entity36 , a senior minister at the @entity37 near @entity38			1
he was one of a diverse group of faith leaders , and representatives of some 300 organizations , brought together by the rev. @entity46 's @entity45			0
on sunday morning , speaking at a @entity48 , mayor @entity16 attempted to preempt the demonstration 's inevitable message : " i understand why some people want us to stop making stops , " he said			1
" innocent people who are stopped can be treated disrespectfully			0
that is not acceptable ... police commissioner @entity17 and i both believe we can do a better job in this area -- and he 's instituted a number of reforms to do that			2
" we believe that when it comes to making stops -- to borrow a phrase from president @entity66 -- the practice should be mended , not ended			1
" however , in official circles , there appears to be strong divergence in opinion			0
" it 's racial profiling of people who are almost all innocent of any wrongdoing , " said @entity0 comptroller @entity72 , who was advocating abolition at the protest march			2
he said he would prefer " strategies of focused deterrents that we have seen in @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 that actually reduce crime			0
" @entity86 , a @entity0 councilman from @entity87 , said @entity35 and @entity17 " have shown no leadership " on the stop - and - frisk issue			1
" inherent in any police officer 's ability to do their job is their ability to stop somebody they feel is reasonably suspicious			2
the current policy is not that -- it 's stopping people because they are black or brown			2
" @entity86 added , " whether you say end it or reform it , we have to end the way that policy currently exists			0

marchers silently protested @entity0 's " stop and frisk " policy
the @entity7 says last year nearly 685,000 were stopped in cases that did n't end in charges
the police department says 87 % were @entity25 or @entity26
" the practice should be mended , not ended , " says the mayor
