-- @entity2 's headed goal early in the second half gave @entity4 a crucial 2 - 1 win over fellow @entity7 heavyweights @entity6 in their @entity9 opener in @entity10			1
continuing the pattern of a free - scoring @entity13 , both sides created a flurry of chances in an open and attacking match despite the stifling heat and humidity of the @entity20 jungle and a pitch of questionable quality			2
@entity6 , inspired by 19 - year - old @entity23 , made a confident start to saturday 's game with the @entity27 winger going close with an early snap shot			1
but it was the @entity29 who went ahead as @entity32 's dummy from a corner left @entity34 the chance to score with a rasping 35th - minute drive from outside the area			0
within two minutes @entity6 drew deservedly level as @entity39 converted from strike partner @entity41 's cross after the @entity43 star had been sent clear down the left by @entity23			2
the eventual winner came five minutes after the break as the excellent @entity46 was allowed to cross for @entity2 to head home at the far post from close range			0
@entity6 pressed forward and created a number of half chances , the best of which fell to @entity41 , who dragged his effort wide			2
but @entity4 , which knocked @entity6 out of the 2012 @entity55 in a quarterfinal penalty shootout , always carried a threat as well -- and veteran playmaker @entity32 rattled @entity59 's crossbar with an injury - time free kick			1
@entity4 coach @entity61 praised his midfielders for their role in a famous victory			2
" i am clearly satisfied with this victory as this match against @entity6 was very difficult , they are a very good team , " @entity61 said			1
" we had a very good basis in midfield , " he added			0
@entity71 1 - 3 @entity70 the win leaves @entity4 well placed to reach the last 16 after @entity70 stunned @entity74 champion @entity71 3 - 1 in the earlier match in the group			1
@entity71 , which kept recovering star player @entity77 on the bench in @entity79 , ended the @entity9 opener with 10 men when @entity82 was sent off for an ugly challenge in injury time			1
@entity71 had looked set for a routine victory when @entity87 fired in a 24th - minute penalty after @entity89 was hauled down			1
but there was a complete reversal of fortunes after halftime as @entity94 drove home a spectacular 54th - minute equalizer			0
three minutes later @entity97 stooped low to head the @entity98 ahead			0
@entity27 's @entity77 , who had knee surgery ahead of the tournament , was still not risked by coach @entity101 despite the dire plight of his team and a sorry night was to get worse			0
@entity94 , on the books of @entity105 but yet to play a first team game for the @entity108 side , capped a fine performance by sending away substitute @entity110 to score a late and clinching third			0
@entity82 then saw red in a moment of madness as he lunged at @entity94 and will miss @entity71 's second group match against @entity6 thursday , which now takes on added importance for both teams after their opening setbacks			1
@entity70 's @entity118 coach @entity117 said @entity94 had changed the course of the game			1
" he 's a man who unsettles you , he surprises , changes the tempo , he was uncontainable for the @entity71 defense , " said @entity117			2
@entity125 3 - 0 @entity124 in saturday 's first match , @entity125 scored the fastest goal of the @entity13 to date to set up a 3 - 0 victory against @entity124 in the opening game of @entity130 @entity132 's deflected shot squeezed over the @entity134 line to give his team a fifth - minute lead in @entity137 , and the @entity74 doubled their advantage in the second half as striker @entity141 netted			1
@entity141 , leading the line in the absence of @entity125 's injured star forward @entity143 , stabbed home at the far post in the 58th minute after a right - wing corner was flicked on			1
@entity124 should have reduced the deficit , but veteran @entity148 headed against the crossbar from close range soon before he was substituted in the 64th minute			2
young midfielder @entity151 sealed @entity125 's victory in time added on , with a low shot that keeper @entity155 could only palm into the corner of the net			2
great things are expected of @entity151 , who moved to big spending @entity161 club as @entity163 from @entity164 for $ 60 million before the start of last season			0
he is nicknamed the " new kid " as he is seen as the natural successor to former @entity118 legend @entity168 , whose nickname was ' the kid " and starred for the national side at three straight @entity172 until 1998			0
@entity125 , in the finals for the first time since @entity168 's last appearance , is considered a dangerous outsider although the loss of @entity143 is considered a major blow			0
@entity143 , a teammate of @entity151 at @entity163 , has not recovered in time from a serious knee injury but has joined his international teammates in @entity182 to lend his support			0
@entity124 has suffered six defeats in the last seven games at the @entity13 and coach @entity186 said his side had been well beaten			0
" they caused us a lot of problems from the opening minutes , " the 59 - year - old told reporters			0
@entity125 coach @entity194 was delighted with his side 's opening win			1
" we were strong going forward , we had a nice style of play and we created several chances , " said the 64 - year - old @entity197			0
@entity202 2 - 1 @entity201 @entity125 will next play an @entity202 team that came from behind to beat @entity201 in saturday 's final match in @entity205			1
@entity201 took a 16th - minute lead through a superb strike by @entity208 midfielder @entity209 , but the second - half introduction of veteran striker @entity211 helped inspire the @entity213 side to victory			1
soon after the 36 - year - old came off the bench , fellow forward @entity215 made up for several misses when he headed home @entity220 's cross in the 64th minute			0
the defender also delivered an assist for @entity224 two minutes later , as the @entity226 striker nodded in a near - post effort that @entity201 goalkeeper @entity228 will be disappointed not to have saved			2
it was the first time that the @entity231 had won their first game at a @entity13 , and another victory on thursday would make a historic first progression to the knockout stages possible			0
@entity201 was the first team to qualify for @entity182 , but now realistically needs to beat @entity124 to have a chance of reaching the last 16 -- as the team did in @entity239 four years ago .			1

@entity4 beats @entity6 2 - 1 in their @entity9 opener in @entity10
@entity70 stuns @entity71 with 3 - 1 win in earlier match in group
@entity132 scores fastest goal of tournament as @entity125 beats @entity124
@entity202 comes from behind to beat @entity201 in other @entity130 game
