@entity0 -- sunday 's debut of the @entity3 , a hand - held game system with a 3 - d display that does n't require special glasses , is n't just the culmination of several years of research and development for one product			1
it could be a milestone for a company that 's spent decades refining three - dimensional technology , only to be met with resistance from consumers			1
playing games in @entity25 " is something that we 've been continually testing and working on at @entity18 , " said @entity15 , who has directed or produced some of @entity18 's most prized franchises and was a key person in the @entity3 's development , through an interpreter			1
" we 've never actually stopped looking at @entity25 as a viable product , " @entity15 said			2
" and it just so happens that the technology in the marketplace now coincides with what we wanted to do			0
so actually , it was just very fortuitous timing			0
" @entity18 projects that it will sell 4 million 3ds units this month , and many analysts agree			2
the system was released in @entity36 last month and in parts of @entity38 on friday			0
@entity18 sold 47 million units of the @entity41 line of systems , which all have two screens , with one being a touchscreen			2
even before the @entity46 launch , the @entity3 is off to the most promising start of any game system in at least a decade , according to pre-sale observations from @entity50			1
without a doubt , it 's @entity18 's strongest foray into the third dimension			2
and there have been many			0
the first commercially available @entity25 product from @entity18 came in the 1980s			1
the @entity56 , @entity36 , company manufactured @entity25 goggles and a companion disc player that could be connected to the @entity59 , called the @entity59 in the @entity46 the project flopped and never made its way outside @entity36			2
then in 1995 , @entity18 tried again with the @entity62			2
players would peer through stationary goggles and manipulate monochromatic red characters that popped out from the screen using a wired controller			0
the system was designed by the team that thought up the @entity70 , but the machine was barely portable			0
it had a battery , but imagine setting up this ridiculous hunk of plastic to play on the train , said @entity15 , who can joke about the defeat now			0
the @entity62 disappeared from shelves less than a year after appearing in stores			0
" when we launched virtual boy , we thought it would work , " @entity15 said			0
" it 's trial and error			0
and we build on mistakes			0
" despite failures , @entity18 's trials continued -- but in secret so that errors were n't subjected to public humiliation			1
for example , @entity18 internally developed hardware that would allow players to enable @entity25 on the @entity96 , which was the home console that preceded the @entity98			1
that project never made it out of the laboratory			0
" it would have required consumers to buy a special lcd screen to attach to the @entity96 to actually play , " @entity15 recalled			0
" we did n't think it was worth that investment for consumers , so it never came out			0
" @entity18 has taken a string of commercial risks in the past decade , racking up an impressive track record			1
the company released a touchscreen gadget called the @entity41 in 2004 , three years before @entity115 would ignite the mobile market with the @entity117			0
in 2006 , the @entity98 became an instant hit , and competitors in the game - console industry scrambled to make motion - detection systems of their own			2
now , 15 years since the company 's last @entity25 system vanished from stores , @entity18 's next bet is on an old horse that has never made it far out of the stable			1
fortunately for @entity18 , the technology has a number of high - profile backers , including @entity132			1
users will be able to purchase @entity25 movies to watch on the device 's 3.5 - inch screen -- larger than most previous ds systems and about the size of the @entity117 's -- or stream video from @entity140			1
" this is an entertainment device ; make no mistake , " @entity18 president @entity141 said			0
" it 's not purely a gaming device			0
" in addition to entertainment features , the @entity3 has a pedometer to appeal to the health - conscious crowd that the @entity151 tapped , as well as a variety of internet and wireless communication applications			1
@entity18 also plans to add a web browser			0
a pair of cameras on the back can snap @entity25 pictures , and @entity18 hints that @entity25 video recording may come			1
but above all , what @entity18 has learned from its research over the past few decades -- and what television makers and rival game companies like @entity167 are learning -- is that @entity25 plus glasses is a losing formula , @entity18 executives said			1
" i think at @entity18 , we realize that any sort of goggle - type 3 - d technology was not going to work , " @entity15 said			1
" in order to make @entity25 technology viable with video games , we thought we needed to have glasses - free @entity25 " @entity18 's aversion to glasses could also rule out @entity25 coming to its home console systems			1
on television screens , @entity25 is difficult to achieve without glasses because people watch from many different angles			2
" glasses - free is a big deal , " @entity141 said			1
" we 've not said publicly what the next thing for us will be in the home console space , but based on what we 've learned on @entity25 , likely , that wo n't be it			2

@entity18 has spent decades developing 3 - d technologies
that work culminates with the @entity3 , a glasses - free @entity25 game system that launches sunday
but the @entity3 comes after a string of failures for @entity18 in the 3 - d space
