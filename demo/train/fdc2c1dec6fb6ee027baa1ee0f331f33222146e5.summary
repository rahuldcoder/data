-- a federal jury ruled friday that @entity2 must pay $ 119.6 million more to @entity3 over patent infringements , according to court documents filed by the @entity6 of @entity7 , @entity8 division			1
the ruling is the latest development in the long - running legal battle between the two tech giants			0
while certainly not insignificant , friday 's decision was by no means a total victory for @entity3 : the @entity16 , @entity17 - based company had actually sought a much higher sum from @entity2 , and the jury only sided with it on two of the four patent infringements that it claimed			1
and according to the court documents , @entity3 must pay @entity2 more than $ 158,000 for patent infringement accusations filed by the @entity26 smartphone maker			1
in a statement , @entity3 said the latest ruling " reinforces what courts around the world have already found : that @entity2 willfully stole our ideas and copied our products			1
" " we are fighting to defend the hard work that goes into beloved products like the @entity37 , which our employees devote their lives to designing and delivering for our customers , " the company said			0
this decision marks another -- and almost definitely not the final -- chapter in the years - long fight between @entity3 and @entity2			2
the two companies are embroiled in dozens of patent disputes in courts around the world			0
@entity3 has typically been the aggressor in alleging @entity2 of " slavishly " copying aspects of its @entity37 and @entity51 technology , though @entity2 has levied a few patent infringement accusations of its own			1
in august 2012 , @entity2 was found to have violated several of @entity3 's patents , and a jury ruled that @entity2 owed @entity3 more than $ 1 billion in damages			2
@entity57 district court judge @entity56 later said that the jury miscalculated the award , and about $ 450 million worth of those damages were reconsidered in a new trial			2
then , last november , a federal jury ordered @entity2 to pay $ 290 million in damages on top of the $ 640 million in damages that judge @entity66 upheld			1
but it 's not likely that decision is final , as both companies have appealed the original august 2012 ruling			0
an appeal of friday 's ruling , too , is still possible -- from either party			0
