-- @entity1 is reluctant to divulge exact numbers , but the @entity3 is a big deal for men 's tennis			1
the season - ending event , worth $ 5 million in prize money this year , is the tour 's marquee event -- an elite eight - man showpiece that attracts top sponsors and acts as a massive advert for the game			1
" it 's one the of the @entity3 's biggest assets , " longtime tournament director @entity1 told @entity0 during this week 's round - robin matches			1
" for it to be a commercial success is extremely important for us			0
" @entity1 , a 58 - year - old former tennis prodigy , has been running the finals for more than a decade now			1
it came to @entity24 's glitzy @entity23 -- best known as a concert venue -- in 2009 after @entity1 took it back to @entity27 for three years			1
@entity28 to @entity29 : tennis gets popstar makeover " the actual financial structure is a bit different			2
we have a partnership here with @entity38 , the owners of the @entity40 , whereas in @entity27 we had a partnership with the municipal government who were very keen to have the event for the purpose of promoting @entity46 and @entity27 and also promoting the sport of tennis in @entity46 , " he said			1
" here it was us wanting to bring the event back to the traditional market of @entity52 , and in particular @entity24			1
" the @entity54 capital has a contract until 2013 , but doubts have been raised about the event 's future on the banks of the @entity60 due to complaints about @entity54 laws which require players to be taxed on all endorsements during the time they are in the country			1
the @entity67 , which runs @entity68 and is also an event partner of the @entity3 finals , is lobbying the government for an exemption			1
" if we lose events like this it will have a big impact not just on the economy but also on sponsors and television and in other areas , " @entity67 chief executive @entity73 told the @entity54 @entity74			0
can @entity82 make finals history in @entity24 ? @entity1 said the @entity3 is happy for the event to stay in @entity24 , which is one of the ruling body 's global headquarters alongside @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			1
" that decision wo n't be made until the second or third quarter of next year			2
that 's a decision for our board			2
we 're very happy here , " he said			2
" we have every reason to believe that next year and the following year will be just as popular			0
" more than 250,000 people attended the 17,500 - capacity arena over eight days in the first two years , and sponsorship has " sold out " with title partner @entity102 joined by luxury - goods brands such as @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 along with the likes of @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity113 power giant @entity112			1
it is broadcast in the @entity54 by public and subscription channels , and in more than 150 countries around the world			0
" it 's our marquee event and it generates a significant amount of money for us , " @entity1 said			1
" and from a promotional point of view this week is the event that everyone is talking about			2
" the 2009 rebranding from the @entity3 has also given the tournament a distinct identity from the four grand slam events of the tennis calendar			1
" a grand slam has two or three major courts , men and women , plus the outside courts over 14 days			2
to have quarter of a million in that time frame on one court is testament to the strength of the event and the players we have right now and their popularity , " @entity1 said			2
" i personally like the rebranding			0
it tells a good story , it 's pretty clear what it is			2
the message is very clear to the consumer			0
" we 're not looking to compete in any way with the grand slams			0
this event is what it is -- the format being eight players , only men , indoors , round - robin -- it speaks for itself as being totally different from a grand slam			1
" @entity1 was one of the most promising young players of the 1970s , winning the @entity166 junior title twice , but was not quite so successful on the senior circuit as he reached a career - high ranking of 34			2
however , he did appear at the season - ending event once , in the doubles at @entity24 's @entity171 in 1988 when it was a separate tournament -- now both formats are run during the same week			1
at that time , @entity174 was nearing the end of a 13 - year run of hosting the singles -- and @entity1 believes that the @entity40 is taking on a similar status to the iconic @entity180 venue			0
" in its time it was one of the special ones , like here			0
the finals was a very special event			0
people still talk about playing at @entity174 , and this is going to be the same , " he said			0
" when you go out there , the court , the crowd -- there 's a certain atmosphere you do n't get very often at sporting events			0
" after ending his career , @entity1 became involved in businesses before being asked to run for a place on the @entity3 board to represent the players			1
he did so for five years before taking on the role of chief executive of the @entity3 's @entity202			1
" i was always interested in the politics and business			0
i was interested in what made the tour tick even as a player , " @entity1 said			0
" @entity208 has been , in relative terms , pretty big business for a long time			0
in terms of professional sport it 's one of the most mature			0
" @entity208 was one of the first where pro athletes could make a serious living from it , back in the 1950s			0
the business has got bigger and more mature , and it 's as strong as it 's ever been 60 years later			0

@entity3 @entity3 is the marquee event of men 's tennis
season - ending tournament brings in 250,000 people over eight days
event director says sponsorship has sold out , generating significant *revenue*
@entity3 happy for it to stay in @entity24 but decision to be made in 2012
