-- @entity1 fell at the semifinal hurdle in the first two grand slams of 2014 , but it was third time lucky for her at the @entity6			2
the @entity7 made the last four at both the @entity10 and @entity11 opens this year only to succumb to defeats , yet there was no such repeat at @entity15 this time around			1
@entity1 saw off third - seed @entity16 -- the highest seed left in the tournament -- 7 - 6 6 - 2 on @entity19 thursday to reach her first - ever grand slam final			1
and the 20 - year - old can now become the first @entity7 female in history to win a major singles title if she can pull off a victory in saturday 's showpiece			1
a highly - anticipated semifinal was at first as gripping as expected , with the 13th seed needing a tie - break to edge a neck - and - neck first set			2
the second , however , was all @entity1 's , as the former @entity15 junior champion outclassed her opponent -- who needed ankle treatment early in the match -- to book her place in the final			1
" this is what i 've worked for , " she said after her comprehensive victory			0
" but it 's not a surprise to me			0
i expect good results like this			0
it 's a step in the right direction			0
i get to play in the final			0
i still have another match so it 's not a full celebration yet			0
" waiting for her is @entity52 , who saw off @entity53 7 - 6 6 - 1 in the day 's earlier semifinal			1
the @entity55 has struggled to build on her first grand slam title since winning at the @entity6 in 2011 , but is now one match away from repeating that success			0
@entity52 claimed the women 's singles championship at @entity15 at the age of 21 , yet she has previously been unable to advance past the final four of a major in the years that have past			1
with compatriot @entity53 coming into the match having yet to drop a set in the tournament , some fancied her to spring an upset and progress past her first - ever grand slam semifinal to reach saturday 's showpiece match			1
however , sixth - seed @entity52 broke her opponent at first attempt , before going on to take a tight first set 7 - 6 , winning 8 - 6 in the tie - break			1
seven games later and the 23rd seed had dropped her second set of the tournament , meaning the world number six had booked her place in her second @entity15 final			2
semifinal spots at the @entity11 and @entity10 opens have had to tide @entity52 over since that 2011 success , but now only @entity1 stands in the way of her securing a second grand slam title			1
" i know how it feels to hold the trophy			0
i really want to win my second title here and i will do everything i can , " @entity52 told @entity15 's official website			2
" it was a tough match mentally because @entity53 is a good friend of mine			2
i knew she would play her best tennis and she did			0
i 'm just happy i won definitely			0
