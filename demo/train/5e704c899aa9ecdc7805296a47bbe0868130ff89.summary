-- @entity1 announced an internal patent agreement on tuesday that it says will empower designers and engineers -- as well as hopefully begin a movement to quell the tech world 's rash of patent infringement lawsuits			1
publicly revealed in a blog post and dubbed the @entity11 ( @entity12 ) , the policy pledges that @entity1 will not pursue offensive litigation over patents without the consent of the employees who created them			1
if someone else sues @entity1 over a patent , however , the company can use patents awarded to employees or former employees to defend itself			1
the @entity12 has been greeted by many developers as an important step away from the " patent trolling " that many tech companies have been accused of recently -- most notably @entity29 , founded by @entity31 veteran @entity30 , as well as @entity32			1
@entity32 sued @entity33 in march for infringement regarding 10 patents in a move many in the tech world saw as an attempt at extortion			0
in an opinion piece for @entity42 , @entity44 founder and former @entity32 employee @entity40 called the suit " an attack on invention and the hacker ethic , " explaining why support for @entity1 's @entity12 has been strong			0
take , for example , the popular " pull - to - refresh " function found in @entity1 's @entity51 that @entity1 had moved to patent the technology -- credited to @entity53 , founder of @entity54 , which @entity1 acquired in 2010 -- stirred some consternation among techies that the company could pursue aggressive litigation down the line			1
the new @entity12 -- which applies retroactively to patents the company has already filed and still gives designers and engineers ultimate power after they leave @entity1 -- essentially rules that out			2
@entity53 endorsed the move in a tweet on tuesday : @ lorenb : big news for pull - to - refresh , and other patents : @entity70 / 2012/04/introd ... incredibly happy to see this moving forward			0
in @entity1 's blog post , vice president of engineering @entity73 says the company has begun to " reach out to other companies to discuss the @entity12 and whether it might make sense to them , too			2
" @entity1 also posted a draft of the agreement to the online open - source archive @entity80 as a way to further spread the word			1
the move to more formally adopted agreements like @entity1 's appears to have already gained some traction among tech companies , as well as developers : @entity90 's engineering lead @entity88 said he 's a " big fan " of the move ; @entity33 has expressed support for the idea ; and the @entity95 startup @entity94 committed to following suit with this tweet : @ nuxnix : @ adam_messinger the @entity12 is a great innovation			2
we will adopt it @ multizone as we have been struggling with exactly this issue			0
thank you do you applaud @entity1 's ipa ? do you think software patents should exist in their present form ? let us know in the comments			0
