-- @entity1 would not be able to read this story if not for people like you			1
@entity1 , who has chronic lymphocytic leukemia in addition to severe diabetes and impaired hearing , needed new eyeglasses last spring but could n't afford them after losing a job he 'd held for more than 40 years			0
then he found out about the @entity11			0
the grass - roots charity pools thousands of small donations to help people get through short - term financial crises			1
donors direct their dollars to the requests they want to fund			1
" i need these glasses very badly or i will have to stop doing a lot of what i do : reading , writing , and working with my computer ; i just ca n't see that well at all , " @entity1 wrote in his request			2
eleven visitors to modestneeds.org pitched in , and within a week @entity1 , who lives in a trailer in @entity29 , @entity30 , received a $ 364 check that changed his life			2
" when i found my message from modest needs today that help was on the way , i cried a few tears of happiness knowing that i would be able to see again , " he wrote in a thank you note			0
stories like that make @entity11 founder and ceo @entity43 giddy			1
" it is so much fun to read these testimonials , " @entity43 said			1
" it 's like @entity49 every day			2
" people often do n't realize how powerful just 10 or 20 dollars can be , @entity43 said			1
in many cases , a small amount can stop a crisis in its tracks			0
" it 's wonderful to see what this does for people , " @entity43 said			1
" you do n't find out until after the fact what kind of an impact these little contributions that people are making ; ... you have no idea what kind of a change you really are making in the person 's life			1
" @entity71 , a graduate student at @entity72 , gave $ 20 to help fund @entity74 's request			2
" glasses are such a small thing , right ? " she said			0
" i mean , the man 's worked 40 - some years and he has cancer			2
the least he should be able to do is have some glasses			0
our social contract with our country -- we should have glasses			2
i mean , come on			0
it 's not that big of a deal			2
" @entity1 wrote a beautiful thank you note that was passed along to the donors			0
@entity71 keeps a copy of it on her desk			0
" your generosity overwhelms me and i just ca n't say in words how very happy i am and i thank @entity99 that someone cared enough for a disabled man , in a very hardship situation , to help me out to see better , " the note read in part			0
@entity43 founded the site seven years ago out of a similar sense of gratitude			1
one evening in 2002 he was marveling at how happy his life was , and remembered a few singular acts of kindness that had helped him get there			0
for example , while in graduate school in @entity111 , he incurred a car repair bill that used up his rent money			1
his boss at his part - time job at a movie theater paid the rent for him -- not a loan , a gift			1
as he reflected on his good fortune , @entity43 pledged , " when i 'm really rich i 'm going to start an organization to help the working poor			1
" that 's when his " aha ! " moment came			0
" it occurred to me all of a sudden that no one who had ever helped me had ever been wealthy , they had just been nice			0
they 'd just had compassion , " he said			0
@entity43 decided to set aside $ 350 to help one individual per month get through a crisis			1
he created a crude web site inviting requests , expecting his effort to remain small , personal and obscure -- " on the millionth page of @entity136			1
" but this was the internet			0
a well - meaning friend posted a link on the widely read blog @entity141 , and the next day @entity43 was swamped with 1,100 e-mails			1
many were asking for help , some were skeptical of @entity43 's motives , and a surprising number of people wanted to contribute , he said			1
at first he fended off would - be donors , because his vision for the project was limited , he said			0
but the e-mails and offers to donate kept coming , along with more requests for help			0
@entity43 soon incorporated modest needs as a nonprofit organization			1
modest needs ' first grant saved a woman 's life : it paid for a mammogram that found a tumor , @entity43 said			1
the organization has done nothing but grow ever since			0
by the end of december , @entity43 expects to have made $ 2.4 million in grants in 2009			2
" every day is another miracle , " @entity43 said			2
" it 's beyond my imagination			0
" here 's how it works : people e-mail their requests -- help with rent or a car repair or a medical bill , for example -- to @entity178 , whose seven - person staff researches and verifies their legitimacy			1
the vetted requests are then posted on @entity182 , where donors can choose which ones they want to help fund			1
once the funding level is reached , a check is sent out			2
a donor can contribute any amount and then let the gift recipient decide where it should go			0
" you 're talking about huge , huge numbers of individual people giving just a little bit of what they have to make the lives of people who have short - term emergencies a little bit better by just keeping them on track , keeping them out of the social services system altogether , " @entity43 said			1
those individual contributions are multiplied by matching grants from larger donors , including musician and recording company executive @entity208 and his wife , @entity209			0
" we really wanted to help him [ @entity43 ] grow that community of small giving , " said @entity210 , president of the @entity211			2
the @entity216 were also struck by how many modest needs grant recipients -- 68 percent , @entity43 said -- turned around and became donors to the organization , @entity215 said			1
" that was extremely exciting to us because that was something we found to be very powerful , " she said			0
@entity74 is among those rebound donors : despite his poverty , he donates $ 5 a month to help others through @entity178 .			0

new : thousands in donations pour in after story is *published*
@entity43 's gratitude for help led him to set up web site to help the working poor
people e-mail their requests -- help with rent , car repair , medical bill -- which are vetted
donors choose how much to give whom ; when goal is reached , check is sent
