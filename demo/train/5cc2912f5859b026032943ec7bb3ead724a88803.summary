-- as the assistant chef and the senior policy adviser for healthy - food initiatives at the @entity5 , @entity1 knows how to fill a plate to the first lady 's approval			1
recently , we caught up with @entity1 at @entity11 's annual @entity10 , where he spoke to health care leaders and innovators about his work with @entity15 on her let 's move initiative to curb childhood obesity			1
so far , @entity1 said , the campaign has overhauled school lunches , replaced the government 's food pyramid with the more consumer - friendly @entity23 , and encouraged pediatricians to write prescriptions for more fruits and veggies			1
" yet we 've only scratched the surface of what 's possible , " he said			1
we asked @entity1 about everything , from what the @entity32 is doing right in terms of healthy eating to what he 's growing in the @entity5 garden this season			1
what do you think has been the greatest breakthrough for the @entity43 campaign so far ? there is n't one magic bullet for what 's having the greatest impact -- there are all kinds of things we are doing and will continue to do			1
but i think what 's really important is that we have unified the country around health			1
you believe we will see the greatest changes to national health when young kids start making healthy eating decisions for themselves			1
are we seeing this transition yet ? i see this all the time			2
we recently had the first ever @entity61			0
there was china , butler service , the president and first lady were there -- the whole nine yards			1
now these kids have gone back to their schools and communities and they 're heroes			0
why ? because they cooked some vegetables in a creative way and they used whole grains to make healthy dishes			1
they 've started owning this for themselves , and it 's what makes them great			1
we start seeing this everywhere , and that 's what gives me great hope that we are really going to turn this around			1
@entity0 : can laws against junk food in schools rein in child obesity ? what are some of the simplest changes @entity32 families can make to their diets ? there are a lot of little things that can be done			1
it 's the first lady 's experience that little changes can have huge impact			1
if families just filled half their plate with fruits and vegetables at dinnertime , it would have a transformative impact on their health			0
if we drank more water and low - fat dairy and nonsugary drinks , that would also have a transformative impact			0
really any of the seven @entity23 tips , if we did any of those , we would really have a great impact			0
it feels like these problems are just so big , but in the end , the solutions can be quite small , approachable and doable			1
i think it 's important to remember that			1
we need to break through and make sure parents have that kind of information they need and we can deliver it to them in ways that are useful			0
you trained under chef @entity136 in @entity137			1
what can we learn from the way people eat abroad ? i think there 's a tremendous amount that we can all learn from the world			2
people are learning from us			0
@entity32 chefs are some of the greatest chefs in the world now			0
but of course we always have more to learn			0
i think what i 've seen ( abroad ) is a love and care for food and the quality of ingredients			2
there 's care taken in making sure people have time to prepare them properly with good portion sizes			2
@entity0 : @entity159 's diet : no more junk - food ads on kids channels what are you growing in the @entity5 garden right now ? we are just ending summer and moving into fall , so we are just picking our last watermelons			1
our tomatoes are still doing great			0
we have a lot of peppers , our zucchinis and yellow squash are just finishing up			0
we have a bunch of beans right now			0
and of course , pumpkins			0
we have the best pumpkin harvest of our time here by quite a lot			0
we will have a fun @entity181			0
what are some of the favorite meals in the @entity5 ? that 's top - secret information			2
the first lady practices what she preaches , which is moderation			2
when we put out the @entity23 guide , she came in and said , " we 're cooking the @entity23			0
" that 's what we 're doing			2
what she 's always said to her kids , and throughout the @entity43 campaign , is that if we 're eating balanced all the time , then when we go to a party and have pizza or cake , it 's no problem			1
we all love fries and burgers and all that stuff			0
but we just ca n't have it day in and day out			0
that 's when we run into trouble			2
what did you have this morning for breakfast ? today the @entity11 team provided a healthy breakfast			2
in line with @entity23 , i had granola with low - fat yogurt and fruit			0
i 'm also a big oatmeal guy			0
oatmeal and bananas are pretty standard for me			0
