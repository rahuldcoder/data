@entity0 -- will pot politics push @entity4 democrat @entity3 to victory on his quest to regain the governor 's mansion ? that 's what some @entity10 are hoping			1
polls show @entity3 and his @entity14 rival , current gov. @entity13 , are neck - and - neck			1
a @entity17 survey released monday has @entity3 at 42 % , @entity13 with 41 % , @entity18 candidate @entity18 with 7 % , and 9 % of likely voters still undecided			1
@entity20 released sunday had the @entity3 and @entity13 at 44 % each			2
@entity3 's law partner , @entity21 , spent millions to get an amendment to legalize medical marijuana on the ballot on tuesday -- a move some say was meant to help @entity3 win by boosting turnout from @entity10 - leaning groups			1
" democrats in @entity4 privately hope that having a medical marijuana initiative on the ballot can bring out a set of voters who are n't otherwise likely to vote in a midterm election , " said @entity30 , a @entity31 reporter who closely follows state politics			1
" it 's very political calculation and one that frankly @entity3 's allies have put a lot of money into			0
" in a sign of a growing trend , 23 states and the @entity0 have already legalized medical marijuana			2
@entity4 is not the only state where pot is on the ballot this year -- voters in @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity0 , have a chance on tuesday to approve measures legalizing recreational use of marijuana , following in the footsteps of pot pioneers @entity0 and @entity59 , where weed has proved to be big business			2
state records show marijuana sales brought in an average of roughly $ 332,000 a month to @entity59 communities in the first eight months of the year			0
there has been some big money behind the ballot battle in the @entity4			0
according to the @entity69 , an estimated $ 4.7 million has been spent on television ads supporting both sides of the debate			0
most of that money -- $ 3.9 million -- has been spent by opponents of the ballot measure , who are financed in large part by conservative casino magnate @entity77			0
in contrast , after a massive effort to get the measure on the ballot , @entity21 and his supporters have spent just $ 828,800 on television ads urging voters to pass the amendment -- a disadvantage that could prove decisive in a race that will come down to the wire			0
that means it could be anybody 's game			0
@entity92 ' cautiously optimistic ' on legal pot " the campaign against [ the amendment ] has been pretty aggressive and i think pretty effective based on the polls so there are a lot of people who are now actually kind of mobilizing to vote against medical marijuana initiative , because they think it 's just problematic , too many loopholes , too easy for people to basically be selling marijuana out in the open , " said @entity94 , the political editor of the @entity95			1
" so there 's at least some speculation that rather than driving young people who are inclined to vote for it to the polls , it 's going to motivate people who are against it to turn out which could help @entity13			2
the amendment needs 60 % to pass and while many polls show strong support for the initiative , it is not clear that there is enough to pass it -- a sign that @entity10 ' high hopes the ballot measure could sway the race for their guy could go up in smoke			1
