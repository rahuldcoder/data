@entity0 -- the @entity3 official in charge of operating the air traffic control system has resigned amid revelations that several controllers have fallen asleep on the job this year , the @entity3 chief said thursday			1
stepping down is @entity10 , who has been the head of the @entity3 @entity12			0
@entity13 , the @entity3 's chief counsel , will be the acting chief of the unit during a search to fill the post , according to @entity17 , the agency 's administrator			1
" over the last few weeks we have seen examples of unprofessional conduct on the part of a few individuals that have rightly caused the traveling public to question our ability to ensure their safety			1
this conduct must stop immediately , " @entity17 said in a written statement			0
" i am committed to maintaining the highest level of public confidence and that begins with strong leadership , " he said			0
the development came after another air traffic controller apparently fell asleep while on duty , the sixth such incident this year that the @entity3 has disclosed			1
the latest incident occurred wednesday morning at @entity39 in @entity40 " when a controller fell asleep while a medical flight carrying an ill patient was trying to land , " the @entity3 said			2
@entity45 transportation secretary @entity44 called the trend " absolutely unacceptable " and transportation officials immediately began making changes and reviews to address the problem			0
for example , @entity17 and @entity44 said the @entity3 will assign an extra air traffic controller on the midnight shift at 27 control towers that have been staffed with only one controller during those hours			1
the @entity3 said @entity17 and @entity62 president @entity61 " are launching a nationwide ' @entity56 ' on air traffic control safety and professionalism " and will visit air traffic facilities to underscore those points			1
the move will include " an independent review of the @entity3 's air traffic control training curriculum and qualifications and the expansion of @entity62 's professional standards committees			1
" the @entity3 is also reviewing staffing and scheduling			0
" we are conducting a top - to - bottom review of the way we operate our air traffic control system , " @entity17 said " we are all responsible and accountable for safety -- from senior @entity3 leadership to the controller in the tower			1
employees at the @entity3 work diligently every day to run the safest air transportation system in the world			2
but i will continue to make whatever changes are necessary to ensure we concentrate on keeping the traveling public safe			0
" along with the @entity40 incident , cases of sleeping controllers occurred at @entity87 in @entity0 and the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity90			0
three incidents involving the same person occurred at @entity93 / @entity93 in @entity94			0
the @entity3 said it also suspended two controllers in @entity97 , @entity98 , for an incident in which they failed to hand off control of a departing flight to the @entity102 , and responded only after several attempts by the same center to hand them control of an arriving flight			2
an @entity3 statement did not indicate whether the @entity97 controllers were thought to have been asleep			0
@entity10 's departure was seen as ironic by some , who said he worked hard to improve the safety culture of the @entity3			1
@entity10 was the guiding force behind the @entity3 's @entity113 ( @entity114 ) , which sought a nonpunitive environment to encourage @entity3 employees to report safety concerns			2
@entity1 's @entity117 contributed to this report			0
