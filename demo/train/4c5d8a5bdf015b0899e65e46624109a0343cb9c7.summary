@entity0 , @entity1 -- she 's been called " beautiful , " " hot " and " sexy " but when it comes to tennis , the most apt description for @entity7 has to be " tough			1
" the @entity8 rallied from a set down three straight times to reach this year 's @entity13 final and then prevailed in saturday 's thrilling three - hour finale against rising star @entity12 , 6 - 4 6 - 7 6 - 4			1
" this is the toughest grand slam final i 've ever played , " @entity7 , who was contesting a ninth such match , summed up as she collected her trophy			1
even after losing the second set and hitting a flurry of double faults , @entity7 still had the edge			2
she 's almost a sure thing in third sets on clay , having triumphed 20 times in a row			0
it 's been six years since the 27 - year - old was defeated after capturing the first set in a clay - court match , too			0
but if @entity12 maintains this form , it wo n't be long before she opens her grand slam account			1
smaller and with less power than @entity7 , the @entity34 nonetheless almost did the unthinkable -- toughing out the now five - time grand slam champion			1
her manager , @entity36 , remains the last @entity34 to win a grand slam , in @entity0 in 1978			1
@entity7 famously uttered in 2007 that she felt like a " cow on ice " playing on clay but the @entity13 has now become her most productive grand slam -- it 's the only one she 's won more than once and it 's the only one she 's won after two serious shoulder injuries in 2008 and 2013			1
" if somebody had told me at some stage in my career that i 'd have more @entity13 titles than any other grand slam , i 'd probably go get drunk , " @entity7 later told reporters			1
" or tell them to get drunk , one or the other			0
" i feel that i worked to get to this position			0
" her victory over the fourth seed made it 50 wins altogether at @entity13 , good enough for seventh among the women in the @entity57			1
" @entity7 is already considered one of the best competitors ever in my view , " tennis analyst @entity58 , a former top - three player in singles and doubles , told @entity2			2
" just take alone what she has done since her shoulder surgery , how she regained her form not only post surgery but post service ( woes ) when most matches she was serving 10 - 15 double faults			0
" also think about clay and her never - give - up attitude with clay			0
" while @entity12 cried in her chair after the match , there were tears of joy for @entity7 , who made the now familiar climb up to her box in celebration			1
@entity12 's mood , however , quickly changed			2
" i was crying at that moment for a few minutes , and then i was smiling because i said that it was my first grand slam final , and i have to be happy , to smile , because i did everything on court , " @entity12 told reporters			1
" i played very good tennis , very good level			0
so i 'm really proud about these two weeks			0
" @entity7 is routinely listed as the world 's richest female athlete with a thick dossier of high - profile sponsors and with saturday 's check of more than $ 2 million , she also moved into second place in career prize money on the @entity99 tour behind @entity100 at upwards of $ 30 million			2
once the @entity101 fell in the second round , @entity7 became the significant favorite			2
she has been virtually unbeatable on clay since the start of 2012 when facing opponents apart from the @entity101			0
stretched to deciders by @entity108 , @entity109 -- @entity100 ' conqueror -- and @entity112 on her way to the @entity13 final , it looked like @entity7 would drop another opening set when @entity12 held an early 2 - 0 lead on a second consecutive sweltering day in the @entity13 capital			1
but @entity7 won the next five games to assume control , only to drop serve			2
that 's when the drama began			0
long games were the norm , pushing the duration of the opener to nearly an hour despite the routine 6 - 4 score			1
a drubbing appeared to be on the cards in the second when @entity7 quickly established a 2 - 0 advantage			2
the double faults -- overall @entity7 hit a dozen after mostly keeping those unforced errors down this fortnight -- combined with a more solid @entity12 soon got things level			1
one of the finest rallies of the tournament -- 20 shots -- won by @entity12 earned her a break point at 4 - 4 and when she took it , a third set loomed			1
a net - cord winner at 30 - 40 , though , allowed @entity7 to break back			2
the to - and - fro ensued to the crowd 's delight			0
@entity12 broke for 6 - 5 , was pegged back to 6 - 6 , then reversed a 5 - 3 deficit in the tiebreak to ensure a first third set in a women 's final at @entity13 since 2001			1
the 22 - year - old 's backhand , likened to that of male finalist @entity150 , and movement , compared to @entity152 , were in full flow -- and in the mental toughness department , she was matching @entity7			1
" she has very strong mental ( game ) , " @entity12 said			0
" in important moments she 's hitting very strong			0
i think i 'm also good mentally			0
i 'm very strong , and i tried just to stay very close to her during the match			0
" by the time it was 1 - 1 in the third , there had been six straight breaks			0
the turning point might have been the fourth game , when @entity7 escaped to hold for 2 - 2			2
the former champion would never trail again , breaking for 5 - 4 after @entity12 said she was affected by a call that went against her and winning the final game with ease			1
@entity150 and @entity168 play in , on paper , a blockbuster men 's final sunday			0
they 'll be hard pressed to top saturday 's offering .			0

@entity7 wins her second @entity13 crown with victory over @entity12
the @entity8 served up a thrilling 6 - 4 6 - 7 ( 5 ) 6 - 4 victory over the first - time grand slam finalist
@entity7 called it " the toughest grand slam final i 've ever played "
