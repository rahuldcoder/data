as pollsters , it 's our job to keep a finger on the pulse of the @entity6 electorate			2
as women , we also take an interest in finding out what female voters are actually thinking			1
it 's never as simple as commentators want you to think			0
we know that @entity14 like to reduce women down to single - issue voters			1
they like to talk about " the women 's vote " as if it 's a monolith			2
as common as those talking points are , they offer a pretty unsophisticated view of women and what women want			2
recently we did a poll for the @entity25 and @entity26 of 1,206 women voters in battleground congressional districts			1
these are the districts that will see competitive races for seats in the @entity33 this fall			0
so what does our polling show ? first , women 's priorities run the gamut , but the most important issues involve jobs and household finances			1
second , the vast majority of women are upset with the status quo and express feelings that range from anger to apathy			2
no one , however , is satisfied			0
to put that into a political context , that 's bad news for the party that holds the @entity53			0
@entity14 should be especially concerned , because their only discernible appeal to women voters has been " republicans do n't like you			1
" it 's a line devoid of substance , at a time when women voters desperately want action on issues of substance			1
for years @entity14 have fixated on a contrived " war on women " to connect with female voters			1
but that routine wo n't get them far today , given their abysmal effort to improve the lives of working families			2
contrary to what @entity14 ' rhetoric would suggest , the economy , government spending and health care rank as women 's top priorities			1
and current policies are n't cutting it			2
the survey also found that only 25 % of women in these districts believe the country is headed in the right direction , while 67 % say it 's on the wrong track			2
a majority ( 53 % ) also disapprove of president @entity90 's job performance			0
on the economy , women are still looking for real solutions that offer women better work opportunities and will actually start growing our economy for all workers			0
they also endorse changes to our tax and retirement laws to allow them to keep more of what they earn and to help small business owners pursue their goals			0
opposition to @entity106 among women is high , with 55 % opposing the @entity14 ' signature health care law			1
just 41 % support it			0
importantly , those who oppose @entity106 feel much more strongly about it than those who support it			0
forty - three percent strongly oppose the law , compared to just 22 % who strongly support it			0
that 's a significant enthusiasm gap that works in the favor of the @entity118 , the party that believes we can do better than @entity106			1
in other words , when our candidates oppose @entity106 and support real health care solutions , they are likely to find support among women			0
in the poll , women said they agree with some basic principles about health care , including the statement , " we need to start over and create real heath care reform that allows us to choose the plans we want , the doctors we need at the cost we can afford			1
" they reject the typical @entity137 one - size - fits - all approach and identify with the statement in the poll that " @entity106 does n't allow women to make health care decisions for their families			1
" none of this is to say @entity118 will have an easy go of it in november 2014 or 2016			1
there was a clear " gender gap " in 2012 , with @entity90 winning the votes of a majority of women			0
that gap will not be erased overnight			0
yet in the last midterm election , in 2010 , women favored @entity118 over @entity14 for the first time in modern history			1
many of those same dynamics are at play in 2014			0
@entity118 do have an opportunity			1
when they make their case to voters , in this cycle and the next , the majority of female voters will be open to candidates who can present substance and solutions			0
simply saying " they do n't like women " is a vapid political strategy that will not be effective for the other side			1
for female voters , ideological debates also are n't seen as helpful			2
by and large they practice the politics of pragmatism			0
they 're looking for leaders who are measured and solution - oriented in their approach			0
the party that represents the status quo will be unacceptable to the majority of women voters			1
the party that provides meaningful , workable alternatives will have the advantage among women voters			1
@entity118 are the party best positioned to take on that role			2
join us on @entity189 / @entity188 .			0
