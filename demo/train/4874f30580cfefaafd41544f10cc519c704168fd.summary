@entity0 , @entity1 -- police forensic scientists involved in the @entity6 murder case made a series of glaring errors during their investigation , according to court - appointed experts who testified monday in her appeal			1
@entity13 , 24 , was convicted and sentenced to 26 years in prison for the murder of @entity18 student @entity16 , 21 , who was found partially naked with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house the two shared			1
@entity13 and her former boyfriend @entity23 , 26 , were convicted on two key pieces of evidence : a 30 - centimeter ( 12 - inch ) kitchen knife and a clasp from @entity30 's bloodied bra			1
authorities testified in the original trial that @entity30 's dna was found on the blade of the knife , @entity13 's dna was on its handle , and dna from @entity23 was on the bra clasp			1
but in their appeal in @entity0 , two independent , court - appointed experts -- professors @entity39 and @entity41 -- were damning in their appraisal of the methods used by police forensic teams			1
@entity41 showed a brief clip of two officers collecting the bra clasp , pointing out how it had been found six weeks after the murder and in a different place			1
there were gasps from the public gallery as the two officers were seen picking up the clasp , passing it from hand to hand , dropping it , picking it up and then placing it on the floor again			2
@entity41 said that although gloves were worn , grubby dirt marks could clearly be seen on the thumb and forefinger of one of the officers			0
" we can see from these circumstances proper protocol was not followed , " he said			0
he also highlighted how the clasp had been placed into a plastic bag instead of a paper bag , saying the risk of contamination was " significant " as a result of how it had been collected			0
the experts said the clasp had been kept in such a poor way that it was covered in rust , and further testing was futile			2
they both stressed that they had worn masks , gloves , paper suits and used sterile knives and scissors during their retesting at @entity89 's @entity88			0
with regard to the knife , @entity39 said their test results were negative for blood and that the amount of @entity31 said to have been @entity30 's was so low , it could not be examined again with any conclusion			2
the two said that , studying the original report , it was clear that " numerous people had been in and out of the crime scene " and that " objects had been moved , " which again put all evidence at risk of contamination			0
in a point - by - point deconstruction , the experts said that because of the errors made by police during the original investigation , the evidence against @entity13 and @entity23 should be considered " inadmissible			1
" @entity13 and @entity23 listened intently as the experts put forward their case , bringing fresh hope to them that they will be freed when the court gives its verdict in september			1
during a break in proceedings , @entity13 's mother , @entity118 , said : " to us this is not earth - shattering , because we have been saying it all along since the original trial , but it was just ignored			1
" it really does beggar the question how they were found guilty in the first place when you see the mistakes that were made during the original investigation , " she said			0
the hearing is scheduled to resume on saturday			0
@entity30 , a @entity133 student from @entity134 , @entity135 , was discovered with her throat slit in november 2007 , in the hilltop town of @entity0 , just two months after she arrived in @entity1 during her year abroad			0
a third defendant , small - time drug dealer @entity16 , an immigrant from the @entity140 , was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing			2
he received a 30 - year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast - track trial in october 2008			0
his sentence was later cut to 16 years			0
@entity13 and @entity23 -- who is serving 25 years -- were found guilty in december 2009 .			2
