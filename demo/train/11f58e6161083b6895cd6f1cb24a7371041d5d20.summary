suppliers in @entity6 are about to start work on two new iphones , according to an article from @entity9			0
the phones will have display screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches across , when measured diagonally -- a major leap from the 4 - inch displays on the @entity14 and @entity15			1
such a move would appear to be an effort to keep up with the competition			0
rival smartphones , most notably those from @entity21 , have been packing ever - larger displays in recent years			0
