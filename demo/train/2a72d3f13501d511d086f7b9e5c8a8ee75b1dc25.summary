-- journalism is not as black and white as most people would like to believe			0
we ought to be able to see all shades of grey between the fresh revelations of email hacking by a @entity9 reporter , the news international phone hacking scandal and other examples of journalists breaking the law to obtain stories			1
the @entity15 revealed last week that @entity9 reporter @entity16 illegally accessed emails from the personal account of @entity19 , also known as " canoe man " , who , in 2007 , pleaded guilty to faking his own death			2
@entity19 's wife , @entity23 , was due to stand trial for deception in 2008 , but the reporter had collected a sufficient amount of emails , he believed , to crush her defense at trial			1
the hacking was authorized by @entity31 , managing editor of @entity9 , who stepped down from his position on the same day the @entity15 story was published			2
emails were given to @entity35 police , used in the successful prosecution and , according to @entity9 , " pivotal to the case "			2
@entity31 has since then tweeted he had been planning to retire for " some time " and the decision was unrelated to the hacking revelations			2
@entity9 claimed the interception of emails was " justified and in the public interest " and " subject to the proper editorial controls "			1
those are the two key aspects that seem to separate this instance from two others : the phone hacking scandal and the outing of the @entity50 blogger by @entity51			1
@entity52 , a detective constable at @entity54 police , won the @entity55 in 2009 for his anonymous blog @entity50 , about life in the police force			0
his identity was then exposed against his wishes by reporter @entity61 , from @entity51			0
the discovery of his identity was revealed in february this year to have been made via the hacking of his email account			2
unlike the outing of @entity52 , the hacking carried out by @entity9 seems to have been a carefully considered decision by a senior executive as to whether it was in the public interest to commit a prima facie breach of the @entity73			1
it was most likely a calculated risk , taken with the understanding that the @entity73 itself offers no public interest defense and that both @entity9 and the reporter would be liable to criminal charges and subject to the discretion of the @entity80 not to prosecute			1
in the @entity50 case , a reporter made the decision to intercept @entity52 's emails without telling his editors and therefore without subjecting his decision to " proper editorial controls "			2
if the @entity73 did offer such defense , the public interest in obtaining information via interception of emails would still have to be weighed by the courts			1
but @entity9 , for instance , would have been able to explain to the public more confidently , from the outset , how the story came to light			0
i would say this is what we want from journalism -- transparency , responsibility and governance			0
this may seem a paradox , but that 's what we want from newspapers and journalists even when they break the law			0
and despite having indisputably broken the law , the process @entity9 seems to have undergone to break this story is a far cry from the industrial - scale criminality carried out and admitted to by @entity118			0
what we have found out so far about phone hacking is that during a period of at least two years , hundreds of individuals had their details collected by a private investigator at the request of journalists			1
deputy assistant commissioner @entity126 , head of @entity127 - the police investigation into phone hacking - told the @entity130 into the culture , practices and ethics of the @entity136 press , that 581 " likely " victims of phone hacking were contacted by police ; 231 were uncontactable and 17 were not contacted for operational reasons			1
subsequent to having their details collected , those individuals had their voicemail messages intercepted , listened to and used for an array of stories no one has been able to prove as yet were in the public interest			1
in fact , the majority of cases we have seen so far , if not all , involved obtaining information to write and publish stories about people 's private lives with no good , justifiable reason			0
there is a fundamental difference between using a private investigator at any given time to turn around a story on tittle - tattle , or to fish for stories and monitor people 's lives , and to make a careful , considered decision to carry out a breach of the law in order to expose wrongdoing			1
no one here is advocating a free for all or trying to make it easier for journalists to act like criminals			0
but if journalists can speak openly about the sourcing of stories , then everybody wins			0
accountability is increased , journalists feel more confident to be transparent about their actions and to pursue genuine stories , and sheer criminality can be more easily identified			0
in my view , the @entity182 , @entity183 ( mainly for protection of sources ) , should all provide a public interest defense for the protection of journalists and real journalism			1
the @entity193 defense for libel , which is always tested in court , should also be improved			0
@entity196 , director of the @entity198 , and @entity199 , professor of journalism at @entity201 , decided to launch the hacked off campaign because it was becoming increasingly clear that phone hacking carried out by the @entity204 was more widespread than @entity118 and the @entity205 cared to let us know			0
the campaign , supported by actors @entity207 and @entity208 , and several other victims of phone hacking and other abuses by the press , pushed and continues to push for criminality to be exposed , but we have always made absolutely clear that genuine , responsible journalism , carried out in the best interest of the public , should be protected			1
we will , however , continue to condemn fishing expeditions and industrial scale data - mining and hacking , which are clearly criminal and unjustifiable .			0

@entity136 journalist argues for public interest defense in some cases of hacking
there is key difference between *peddling* *gossip* and exposing wrongdoing
on rare *occasions* , journalists could be justified in monitoring emails , phones , she argues
