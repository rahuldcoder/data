-- the announcement wednesday of a diplomatic breakthrough between the @entity3 and @entity4 is a welcome surprise at a critical time			1
not only are more than 6 million @entity4 facing food shortages , but also the window is quickly closing for the @entity3 to have any leverage over @entity4 's nuclear program , given the changing global balance of power			1
in exchange for an initial 240,000 tons of @entity3 food aid and prospects for improving bilateral relations and returning to six - party talks , @entity4 agreed to halt its uranium enrichment program , accept monitoring by the @entity19 , and stop testing its long - range missiles			1
contrary to some media assertions that @entity3 food aid has not been linked to denuclearization , @entity21 has stalled for over a year on sending food to @entity4 , despite a direct appeal from @entity26 , and after several assessments , including by the @entity28 , the @entity29 , and a team of five @entity3 nongovernmental organizations , all verifying the urgent need			1
so what shifted ? for one , the @entity36 administration appears to have concluded that the succession to @entity38 has been a smooth transition and that the imminent collapse of the @entity4 regime is unlikely			1
it has likely realized that nonengagement has been a complete failure			0
@entity46 president @entity45 has refused aid , trade and talks with @entity4 until @entity26 apologizes for its alleged sinking of a @entity46 navy ship and shelling of @entity53			0
not only has the opposition @entity56 in @entity46 called for an end to sanctions and closer ties with @entity4 , even members of @entity45 's own party are calling for more engagement			2
moreover , as @entity63 's trade and aid to @entity4 have continued to grow , @entity3 - led sanctions have not had their anticipated effect of undermining the @entity4 regime			1
to the contrary , there are signs that @entity21 's ability to influence @entity4 's behavior , including its nuclear program , is on the wane			2
according to @entity73 , the former head of the @entity74 who worked in @entity4 for 15 years , there are rumors that @entity63 already has or is planning to send food aid and fuel , though the amount is unclear			1
" why would [ @entity4 ] deal with the @entity3 ? " she said			2
" the train has left the station			0
" this week 's diplomatic breakthrough may indeed be one of the last opportunities @entity21 has to influence @entity26 's nuclear program			0
as secretary of state @entity88 put it at a @entity91 hearing , " the world is transforming around us			0
" why , then , is @entity4 making concessions to the @entity3 ? @entity4 still needs the @entity3 to lift its sanctions and to formally end the @entity94			1
according to the @entity95 , the @entity3 affirmed during talks in @entity97 that its sanctions were not intended to target the @entity4 people and that once six - party talks began , priority would be given to lift the sanctions			1
@entity4 view resolving tensions with the @entity3 as a crucial step to joining the international community , including being able to access loans from international financial institutions to recalibrate their economy			2
this point was made last year by former president @entity111 , who explained , " in almost any case when there are sanctions against an entire people , the people suffer the most and the leaders suffer least			0
" in the case of @entity4 , @entity111 said that " the last 50 years of deprivation of the @entity4 people of adequate access to trade and commerce has been very damaging to their economy			0
" most @entity3 do n't realize that underlying tensions with @entity4 stem from the unresolved @entity94 , which ended not with a peace treaty , but only with a temporary armistice			2
we can not lose sight of the fact that peace is the only solution to ending hunger in @entity4			0
@entity4 need food aid , but they also need an end to hostilities , the lifting of sanctions and a genuine engagement plan that includes a formal resolution of the @entity94			1
this week 's diplomatic breakthrough brings us that much closer to realizing peace on the @entity141 and gives hope that denuclearization there and elsewhere can be still achieved through diplomacy			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

@entity147 : apparent breakthrough on @entity4 nukes comes at critical moment
she says @entity36 administration sees regime not likely to collapse
@entity157 : @entity63 's sway could grow with food aid ; and there are signs that @entity3 influence waning
@entity157 : still , @entity4 needs @entity3 to lift its sanctions and to formally end @entity94
