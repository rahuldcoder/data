@entity0 -- @entity0 's @entity3 voted thursday to require parents to sign a consent form before having their child undergo a controversial @entity9 @entity8 circumcision ritual after two children died from the herpes virus contracted during the procedure , authorities said			1
the parental consent form must include information regarding the possible fatal risks of the ritual , according to @entity17 , a spokeswoman from the @entity18 and @entity19			1
it 's not clear if the form will absolve clergy from potential lawsuits			2
the ritual , known as the metzitzah b'peh , is a type of circumcision in which the person performing the procedure , or mohel , directly places his mouth on and sucks the blood from the baby 's newly circumcised penis			1
the controversial ritual came under intense scrutiny earlier this year after health officials reported 11 babies had contracted herpes infections between 2000 and 2011			0
why i did n't circumcise my sons the health department reported that an estimated 20,493 infants in @entity0 were exposed to direct oral suction in that period			1
" there is no safe way to perform oral suction on any open wound in a newborn , " said the health commissioner , dr. @entity46			1
baby boys who were reportedly circumcised " with confirmed or probable orogenital suction " between april 2006 and december 2011 had an estimated risk of contracting neonatal herpes ( @entity58 - 1 ) infection of 24.4 per 100,000 cases , 3.4 times greater than other infants , the health department said			1
" the ethical duty to protect the interests of vulnerable infants and to support parents in making informed and responsible choices can not be overridden , " a group of doctors and bioethicists from the @entity68 said in a letter to mayor @entity70			0
@entity72 , a @entity8 pediatrician , hailed the decision , saying authorities should protect children " from the consequences of unwise decisions			0
" " in my mind , the amendment does n't go far enough -- getting parental consent for circumcision in general , that 's appropriate and sufficient , but consent for the metzitzah b'peh should not be allowed , " he said			1
it " should not be performed , period			0
" top pediatrics group : benefits of infant circumcision outweigh risks members of the orthodox community blasted the decision , calling it an infringement of constitutional rights			2
" by telling a mohel he is prohibited from performing a religious ritual unless he tells the parents that , by the way , the child might die in the process , you are forcing us to say something which we are convinced is wrong , " said rabbi @entity95 of the @entity97 - based @entity96 of @entity98			2
@entity95 and other community members say they plan to contest the regulation			0
" we want to work , we have tried , and we are committed to work with the @entity18 to address their concerns in any way , shape or form that does not conflict with our religious and constitutional rights , " he said			0
