-- if this weekend 's box office battle was a big - screen boxing match , it would have been the original " @entity4 " : grinning , glamorous @entity5 against little - known and less - regarded @entity6			1
no one expected that one to go the full 15 rounds , either			0
in this weekend 's showdown , it was the established " @entity13 " against newcomer fantasy action flick " @entity12			1
" " @entity13 " held the title belt , but not by much : the adaptation of @entity17 's best - seller earned roughly $ 26.8 million compared with " @entity12 's " $ 23.5 million			1
but " @entity13 " seemed to have everything going for it , including big - name stars ( led by @entity22 winner @entity21 ) , critical acclaim and tremendous word of mouth			1
estimated second - weekend ticket sales fell just 29 % , compared with the 40 % to 50 % decline most box office champs suffer in their second week out			0
unlike the champ , " @entity31 " seemed to have everything going against it			0
with the lead role held by @entity34 , best known as the bad guy in last year 's " @entity38 , " there was a lack of major stars			2
then there was the consideration of competition : horror movie " @entity43 " had opened the previous weekend , and unlike last year , most fright flicks are underperforming in 2014			1
and the reviews ? most critics put a stake through its heart , leaving " @entity12 " at a putrid 26 % on @entity48			2
yet when the dust settled , " @entity12 " was the weekend 's top new movie			1
it 's a fresh take on the @entity52 legend : @entity34 plays @entity53 as a heroic figure who 's willing to do anything , including join the undead , to protect his family and his homeland			2
when you add in international ticket sales , the action - horror movie has already made back its $ 70 million budget			0
newcomer " @entity66 and the @entity67 , @entity65 , @entity79 " also had much going for it , making its debut with big stars ( @entity72 and @entity73 ) and a story based on a much - loved book ( @entity78 's 1972 children 's classic )			1
while the live - action comedy knocked rival family film " the @entity83 " well down the chart , it also found itself sitting on the sidelines in third place			2
the weekend 's other new movies , " @entity88 , " starring @entity89 and @entity90 , and " addicted , " starring @entity91 and @entity92 , performed about as expected , debuting fifth and seventh , respectively			1
and after 2Â½ months , " @entity94 " finally fell out of the top 10			0
that said , people are still going to see the top - grossing movie of the year : it 's up to $ 326 million domestic			1
turns out we are all @entity101			0
weekend domestic box office estimates from @entity103 , with final numbers available monday afternoon : 1			0
" @entity13 " : $ 26.8 million ( $ 78.3 million total ) 2			2
" @entity12 " : $ 23.5 million ( debut ) 3			1
" @entity66 and the @entity67 , @entity65 , @entity79 " : $ 19.1 million ( debut ) 4			0
" @entity43 " : $ 16.4 million ( $ 62.2 million total ) 5			0
" @entity88 " : $ 13.3 million ( debut )			0

" @entity12 " was the weekend 's top new movie
but *returning* champ " @entity13 " held the title belt
family comedy " @entity66 " opened at *no.* 3
