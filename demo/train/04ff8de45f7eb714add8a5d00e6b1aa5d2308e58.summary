" it 's the latest twist in a complicated crisis with dizzying developments involving several countries			0

" @entity114 's blood is precious , it 's precious and it represents the blood of all @entity11 , " his father said			2
but the pilot 's father suggested his son 's case should n't be mixed up with @entity50 's			0
" to link @entity114 's situation with the @entity28 journalist , this has nothing to do with us , " he said			2
" the @entity28 journalist has his country to defend him			0
" @entity4 , which holds large areas of @entity61 and @entity55 under its brutal rule , has a grim track record of ruthlessly killing hostages			0
last year , it publicized its series of beheadings of three @entity144 and two @entity143 captives			0
the group has made a series of demands regarding the @entity11 and @entity28 hostages			1
in a saturday post purportedly from @entity4 , a voice thought to be @entity26 's first set out the idea of exchanging him for @entity30 , but no clear deadline was mentioned			1
