-- @entity3 raider @entity1 failed in his bid to become the first @entity6 trained winner of the @entity7 when he was denied by home - grown outsider @entity8 at @entity10			1
after a huge last - to - first move , @entity1 was dramatically run down in the final strides by @entity8 to give jockey @entity13 his fourth win in the race , breaking thousands of @entity3 hearts in the process			1
@entity1 , already a @entity19 winner in his home country , looked to be pulling clear of the field as they entered the home straight			2
but four - year - old filly @entity8 responded to her jockey to run down @entity1 , ridden by four - time champion jockey @entity26 , winning by a head			2
although not considered among the favorites heading in to the @entity10 showpiece , @entity8 's victory maintains the successful recent record of fillies in this race			0
last year 's winner , @entity34 , was also a filly			1
thousands of @entity3 fans and more than 100 accredited journalists from the country had descended on @entity39 to witness arguably their best chance at capturing the @entity7 since @entity41 in 2006			1
racing - mad @entity3 has long had designs on @entity44 's most prestigious race , having sent their first runner to @entity10 in 1969			1
@entity46 was widely considered among the favorites for this year 's edition , despite being drawn in the unfavorable stall 18 -- the widest possible berth			1
widely considered @entity44 's most prestigious all - age race , this year 's running was notable for its high - profile absentees			2
first @entity56 's tough filly @entity54 , third in this race in 2011 , was ruled out after suffering a slight injury in training			0
then defending champion @entity34 was sensationally scratched after an outbreak of swamp fever at her training center in @entity64			0
although @entity34 herself is completely healthy , @entity64 veterinary authorities immediately slapped a travel ban on all horses entering or leaving the facility , meaning she was unable to make the trip to @entity39			0
with @entity72 , rated the best horse in the world , also opting to sit this one out , it appeared to leave the field wide open for @entity1 , who had previously demonstrated form over the mile - and - a - half distance , as well as a devastating turn of foot			0
outside of the duel for first place , @entity82 , ridden by @entity84 jockey @entity83 , finished third			0
the @entity86 - trained @entity85 , ridden by @entity88 jockey @entity87 , never factored and finished down the field in seventh place .			0
