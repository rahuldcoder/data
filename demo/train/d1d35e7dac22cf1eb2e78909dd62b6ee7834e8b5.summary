@entity0 -- the village of @entity3 in @entity4 is sleepy , picturesque , and does not normally make national news			1
but it hit the headlines this month when a controversial sign was put up at the children 's rugby club			1
" please remember ! these are kids , " it said			1
" this is a game			0
this is not the @entity17			0
" this sign was quickly reported by the press , and even featured on today , @entity20 's flagship politics and current affairs program			0
clearly , the @entity3 kids ' rugby club had touched a nerve			1
rugby culture is good - natured in @entity27 , and a sign of this sort is unusual			0
but a host of other junior pastimes , including soccer , @entity27 's national sport , is plagued by adult boorishness			1
in march , the @entity35 staged a " silent weekend " for all soccer teams aged seven to 18			1
parents were allowed to applaud when players from both teams entered or exited the pitch , or scored a goal			2
otherwise , they watched in silence			0
@entity43 , the @entity35 's county welfare officer , came up with the idea after seeing a nine - year - old boy reduced to tears during a game			1
" he was genuinely scared , " he said			0
" poor lad was simply terrified by all those baying adults			2
" by all accounts , the initiative was a success			0
but it was also a drop in the ocean			0
last year , @entity57 , the legendary @entity59 footballer and television presenter -- who incidentally never received a single yellow card for unsporting behavior throughout his playing career -- lambasted " maniacal parents on the touchline spouting nonsense at their children			1
" " the competitive nature of most mums and dads is astounding , " he wrote in an essay for @entity69 magazine			0
" if we could just get them to shut the f --- up and let their children enjoy themselves , you 'd be staggered at the difference it would make			1
" @entity57 even went so far as to hold parents ' behavior partially responsible for the stunted development of @entity84 soccer , which has " never produced , proportionally , as many technically efficient players as most other countries			1
" parental behavior on the touchlines is a deep - seated problem in the @entity27			0
a 2011 study by @entity91 found that three quarters of @entity27 children had endured " unhelpful criticism of performance , being shouted and sworn at , being embarrassed and humiliated "			2
" disrespectful and emotionally harmful treatment of young people , " it concluded , is " commonplace in children 's experience of sport in the @entity27			2
" it is also a problem elsewhere in the world			0
a definitive poll of 23,000 adults in 23 countries , carried out jointly by @entity108 and @entity109 in 2010 , found that 60 % of @entity110 had witnessed bad behavior by a parent on a touchline			2
this was reflected by 59 % of @entity115 ; 55 % of @entity116 ; 54 % of @entity117 ; 53 % of @entity118 ; and 50 % of @entity119			0
what lies behind this ugly trend ? partly , it has to be chemical			0
studies have shown that spectators as well as players experience a flood of testosterone after a win , making it easy for parents to lose a sense of perspective when their children are competing			1
there are also convincing psychological explanations			0
the late professor @entity136 , a pre-eminent family therapy expert at @entity138 , blamed a lack of " completeness " in parents , leading to a belief that the child 's successes are an extension of their own			1
all this pressure , he argued , is intensified by the fact that away from the sports field , cosseted modern life offers few opportunities for blood - and - guts heroics			1
professor @entity136 suggested that parents distance themselves from the action : the more likely you are to start yelling , the further away you should sit			2
" for you it 's venting , but for your kid it 's damaging in so many ways , " he said in an interview with his university magazine			0
" they may start to feel that they 're losers not only in the game , but in life			0
" whatever the excuses , parents need to get a grip			2
but despite the success of initiatives like @entity171 , it would be a mistake to go to the other extreme and sanitize children 's sports			1
@entity177 's bestselling book " how children succeed " -- which has revolutionized thinking in @entity110 's public schools -- has demonstrated that qualities like grit , determination , optimism and discipline are key determinants of success in life			2
if such " mental toughness " can not be forged on the sports field , how can it be developed at all ? it may be " only a game , " but character - building is surely the whole point			2
many adults tell epiphanic stories of the moment a tough - love adult gave them the self - belief and drive they needed , even though it was unpleasant at the time			1
my wife , for instance , credits a painful school athletics session , in which her coach refused to let her leave until she had jumped the highest hurdles , with her subsequent junior sporting success			0
for this to work , however , the overall context has to be healthy			0
@entity214 - coddling children may not do them any good , but any tough love must be designed to make them stronger , not break them			1
and for that to happen , the adults on the touchlines must learn to grow up -- whether their kids are playing rugby or anything else .			1
