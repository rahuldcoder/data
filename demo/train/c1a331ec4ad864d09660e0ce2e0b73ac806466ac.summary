would such a brazen act be even remotely possible today ? for baseball fans everywhere who will be watching game 4 of the @entity5 , scheduled to be played sunday night in @entity6 , the first instinct is probably : there is no way any team could come close to getting away with it			1
the 1919 @entity12 -- forever known in @entity14 lore as the @entity15 -- thought , for a while , that they had pulled it off			1
at the behest of gamblers , a group of the team 's stars purposely lost the @entity1 against the @entity23			1
their deed has become the stuff of legend in sports history , movies and books			2
by 1921 , eight of the players had been banished from baseball			2
today , though , with multicamera instant replays in the slowest of slow - motion and the closest of close - ups , with media saturation , with @entity38 and @entity39 available to disseminate conspiracy theories and rumors , players would seem to have no chance to do such a thing			0
even looking back at it from the vantage point of our seek - any - edge - you - can era of performance - enhancing drugs , the audacity of what the @entity15 did is almost incomprehensible			1
throwing the @entity1 ? say it ai n't so , @entity53			1
the supposition is that they were able to do it because back then , no one really knew for sure			0
there was no television , of course , but there was also no radio , as far as baseball was concerned			0
the first radio broadcast of a baseball game did not occur until 1921			0
thus -- so accepted wisdom has it -- the @entity15 got away with throwing the @entity1 because , whispers aside , no one at the time , or for the next year , was able to authoritatively pinpoint what was going on			1
but there is a fascinating and telling artifact in longtime sports columnist @entity74 's new anthology , " from @entity15 to @entity75 : a century of @entity77 's @entity76			1
" one story in the book -- a straight sports - news report , written by @entity81 of the @entity82 on october 7 , 1919 , right in the middle of the @entity1 ( which was best - of - nine - games that year ) -- nails it			1
reading the story makes it clear : even before social media , before sports talk radio , before all the ways of dissecting and discussing the minutiae of the games , a reporter with a good eye could spot , and document , games being thrown			1
@entity74 said that when he first came across @entity99 's almost - century - old news report , he was startled : " here was a guy who was writing it in real time , as the games were going on			1
and he found a way to say it			1
" here are some of the words from @entity99 's reporting of that thrown series : " ' they are n't hitting			1
' " those few words spoken by @entity109 , manager of the @entity12 , offered an explanation for a large part of the cause for the fourth defeat of the south siders yesterday in the @entity1 against the @entity23			1
they got three hits off @entity117 and never once in the whole game had a good chance to score a run			0
" ' i do n't know what 's the matter , ' the @entity15 leader continued , ' but i do know that something is wrong with my gang			2
the bunch i had fighting in august for the pennant would have trimmed this @entity23 bunch without a struggle			0
we hit something over .280 for the season in the @entity135 pennant race			0
that 's the best hitting any ball club ever did in the history of baseball			2
the way those .280 hitters batted against @entity117 , they could n't make a place on a high school team			2
' " and ( again , manager @entity109 talking to reporter @entity99 ) : " i am convinced that i have the best ball club that ever was put together			1
i certainly have been disappointed in it in this series			0
it has n't played baseball in a single game			0
there 's only a bare chance they can win now			2
the gang that has played for me in the five games of the world 's series will have to have luck to win another ball game			2
" and ( in @entity109 's hotel room as he spoke to @entity99 , after the two had shared a cab from the ballpark ) : " [ @entity109 ] clearly indicated he was mad enough to lick a lot of people and go to jail for it			1
he clearly indicated there was something wrong and that he intended to find out what it was			0
' you know , ' he spoke up , ' it does n't seem possible that this gang that worked so great for me all summer could fall down like this			0
i tell you , i am absolutely sick at heart			0
" ' they have n't played any baseball for me			0
i thought all of them were my boys			0
i felt like a school teacher might feel toward his pupils			0
i loved those boys for the way they fought for me this summer			0
those fellows were right around me and i would have staked my life they would have gone through for me in the world 's series ... something has happened to my gang			1
if they would just play baseball for me for the rest of the series , they might even pull it out yet			0
the team i had most of the time all summer would do it			2
i have n't had the same team on the ball field in a single game			2
' " three days later , after the @entity15 had lost the @entity1 , @entity99 quoted manager @entity109 : " i do n't know yet what was the matter			1
i did n't like the betting odds			0
i wish no one had ever bet a dollar on the team			2
" today , with millions of eyes , both human and electronic , on every move the ballplayers make in a @entity1 , the thought of a cabal of players presuming they could get away with throwing the games seems unfathomable			1
but in the most infamous @entity1 ever played , there were many , many fewer eyes watching			1
yet some of those eyes , it turns out , seemed to understand what they were seeing			0
and what they were seeing just did n't add up			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity228 : throwing @entity1 ? seems *impossible* with fans watching so intently
but it happened , infamously , in 1919 . a clever *sportswriter* found a way to say it without saying it
@entity82 reporter quoted @entity12 manager 's *bafflement* at his team 's lousy performance
@entity228 : in *pre-digital* era , reporter @entity99 artfully *telegraphed* @entity1 was thrown
