-- it can not be denied that african - americans have made tremendous progress -- and one of the most significant factors that contributed to black success and survival has been our faith in @entity10			1
the manifestation of that faith is the religious community , which consists mostly of @entity15 churches that have produced positive spiritual , social , economic and political results for black @entity17			1
the question is whether black churches can continue to be the instruments of empowerment that they historically have been			1
perhaps an understanding of the emergence and prominence of the @entity26 church will offer some insight to the potential that these churches still possess			1
eighty - seven percent of african - americans report they are affiliated with a particular religious group , and 95 percent of those claim to be @entity33 , according to the 2007 @entity35 @entity34 conducted by the @entity36			0
belief in @entity10 , regular prayer , worship attendance and belief in life after death are some of the core beliefs of a large majority of african - americans			0
although the expressions of faith and religious practices might differ , religious faith itself is a constant in black @entity17			0
the @entity26 religious experience is a result of a convergence of @entity26 culture , biblical hermeneutic and social resistance , woven into institutions			0
the common threads among the culturally diverse @entity26 slaves in @entity17 were communal living , extended families , cultural leadership and a deeply rooted appreciation for spirituality			2
enslaved @entity66 were exposed to the literature of the @entity68 , and they found comfort and direction in the same book that was used to justify their enslavement			1
slaves met the indignities and injustices that denied them their humanity with the same resistance that humans throughout history have shown oppression			0
religion in general and @entity15 in particular became an answer to the mysteries of the cosmos and a way to cope : only a belief in an unseen power and a faith in a divine advocate could sustain a people who faced such daunting circumstances			1
when the highest court in the land relegates one 's race to subhuman status as a matter of law -- which the @entity99 did in the @entity101 decision of 1857 -- people need a source of authenticity for their identity			0
that source for african - americans was the @entity68 , who had sent @entity107 to lead the slaves out of slavery and who had sent his son to preach " good news to the poor and set the captives free			1
" but that cultural background within @entity15 translated into an ecclesiology that not only nurtured the development of the black churches , but also conferred upon black clergy a status that has been akin to royalty			1
although the role of professional clergy in the @entity125 church at large was viewed as a vocation , @entity26 - @entity35 tended to treat their clergy as more than just employees of the church -- they were royal tribal leaders for the community			0
so the separation between the sacred and the secular , the religious and the political , has not been as distinct among african - americans			0
the clergy had to be advocates for justice , arbiters of internal disputes within the community and managers of sacramental affairs , all in one			0
and the churches themselves had to be more than places to learn about and worship @entity10			2
in a segregated society , church was the place where people fulfilled their human potential , developed their @entity10 - given talents , made corporate decisions , voted for their officers , owned property , created benevolent societies , raised money for schools and scholarships , celebrated their marriages , blessed their babies , mourned their loved ones ' deaths and even learned how to read			1
when states passed laws making it illegal to teach black people to read , many learned in church			2
even people with little faith had great respect and admiration for the church , if for no other reason than it was a " surrogate world " for black people , as @entity175 noted in his book , " @entity177 in @entity17 , " in 1963			2
the worship styles , doctrinal distinctions and organizational structures are so diverse that it is really a misnomer to refer to " the " black church			2
many black churches make up the black religious experience			1
what is irrefutable is that without a deep and authentic faith and a passion for the institutional development of that faith , @entity26 - @entity35 could have never sustained the fortitude necessary to survive and succeed in the @entity26 experience			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the rev. @entity196 , @entity197			0

@entity196 : churches *helped* blacks ' political , cultural , spiritual progress
slaves found , in the @entity68 , a means to cope with dire circumstances , he *writes*
more than place of a worship , @entity196 says . people fulfilled potential there
he says black churches instrumental in *helping* people survive and succeed
