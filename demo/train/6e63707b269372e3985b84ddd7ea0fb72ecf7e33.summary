-- @entity1 is working on her doctoral degree in @entity4 and can tackle most complicated education theories with ease			2
that 's not the case when it comes to picking a health insurance plan through her school			1
" it is daunting -- at times , more difficult to interpret than the scholarly research i pore through for my own dissertation , " @entity13 said			2
" i feel like handing it over to my partner after the first page			0
" welcome to open enrollment season -- a season some people dread more than tax time			1
while you 've been hearing a lot about @entity28 this week , the majority of @entity25 do n't need to buy their policies through the new health insurance marketplaces , also called exchanges			1
instead , most will get next year 's health insurance through work			1
in fact , you probably have an e-mail sitting in your inbox right now reminding you to pick a plan			2
and @entity13 is not alone in her lack of confidence over how to pick the right policy			0
a good number of people look at that open enrollment e-mail and essentially take a wild guess at what plan works best for them , according to a recent study published in the @entity48			1
just 11 % of the people surveyed could figure out what a four - day hospital visit would cost given a hypothetical insurance plan			1
these were people who thought they had a pretty good grasp on how health insurance works			1
" @entity25 do seem a little terrified when it comes to making decisions about insurance , " said @entity55 , the owner of @entity56 in @entity57 , @entity58 , and president of the @entity60			1
" when they come in i tell them they can relax and we have a casual conversation about what it is they are looking for in insurance and what 's most important to them , and i try to take that fear away			2
" studies show the more you know about your insurance plan the more you can save			1
here are five things to think about when you pick your health plan for next year : be realistic you want to look at three costs : your deductible , your maximum out - of - pocket costs , and the premium cost contribution compared to the year before			1
glossary : understanding health insurance terms just because it is the most expensive plan does n't mean it is the right one for you			1
not everyone needs a " @entity91 plan , " @entity55 says			2
less than 10 % of the population is admitted to the hospital every year			2
look at what you spent last year			2
if you notice you did n't go to the doctor very much , or did n't get a lot of prescriptions , and you have some savings , pick the plan with the less expensive premiums			1
the deductibles will likely be higher , but even if you have to visit your primary care physician once or twice , it 'll probably still be cheaper			2
plus , with @entity28 , all plans that are not grandfathered in will cover preventive health services , whether you meet your deductible or not			2
preventive health services include immunizations , blood pressure tests , mammograms , mental health services , smoking cessation programs , depression screening , diet counseling , and other services			2
do n't get sentimental a lot of people stick with the kind of plan they 've always had out of habit , but your life circumstances change over time			1
if you 've had a new baby you may want one kind of plan that covers those costs			1
if your children have left home , you may not need as much coverage			0
pick the policy that fits your current needs best			0
@entity55 says he often has to remind clients that with life changes , certain policies may be better than others			0
understand your options employers often offer three types of plans : point of service , @entity142 and @entity143			1
if you are n't attached to a particular doctor , you may want to pick the @entity143 option , which could save you some money			0
an @entity143 is typically the cheapest , but you 've got to use doctors who are in that program 's network			0
even if you love your doctor , it does n't hurt to check to see if he or she is in the @entity143 network as well			0
with a ppo you will likely pay a higher premium , but you 'll have a wider variety of doctors to choose from			0
it will save you money to stick with those doctors , but you can also go out of network for a higher fee			0
a @entity164 plan , which is a mix of an @entity143 and @entity142 , typically provides a wider variety of doctors as well			0
but with that plan you 'll have to pick a primary care physician who will need to give you a referral to see any kind of specialist			1
pos plans are typically more expensive , but they give you the most flexibility			0
each kind of plan comes with a standardized form that includes a summary of benefits and coverage			1
that 's mandatory under @entity28			0
it will walk you through all the benefits of each plan so you can compare them easily			0
it should tell you how much you will pay for it			0
if something is n't covered by the plan , it should say so			1
stay healthy it may sound simple , but many people can pick a less expensive plan if they practice good health habits			1
preventable illnesses make up 70 % of health care costs , according to a study in the @entity200			1
participate in your company 's wellness program			0
watch what you eat , exercise , do n't smoke , drink less and maintain a proper weight			0
11 simple weight loss tips the less you need to go the doctor , the less you spend			0
the fewer unhealthy behaviors you have , the less your -- and others ' -- insurance costs			1
for instance , it costs 18 % more for an insurance company to provide coverage for a smoker , according to the @entity216			1
talk to the experts do n't guess -- find a trusted adviser who can help walk you through the details			2
" people are afraid to ask questions			0
you should never be afraid to ask , " @entity55 says			0
talk to someone who can explain terms to you or even help you just crunch the numbers			0
your benefits person at work or a broker should be happy to help you figure out the plans and what 's available .			0

study : many @entity25 are *confused* by health care insurance open enrollment
be realistic about your potential costs and how much coverage you need
do n't stick with a plan just because you had it last year -- understand your options
staying healthy is the best way to avoid paying more for health insurance
