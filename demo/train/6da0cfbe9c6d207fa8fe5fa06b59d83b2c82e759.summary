@entity0 -- @entity3 's parliament voted thursday to increase the powers of @entity6 's bailout fund , as @entity8 's debt woes fuel fears of a wider financial crisis			1
the vote passed by a large majority -- 523 in favor to 85 against , with three abstentions -- which should boost confidence in @entity6 markets			1
expansion of the @entity18 -- @entity6 's bailout fund -- so it can increase its lending capacity from around â ‚ ¬ 250 billion to â ‚ ¬ 440 billion must be ratified by a number of @entity6 countries			1
@entity3 's parliamentary approval follows votes in favor this week from @entity25 and @entity26			2
but the vote in @entity3 's lower house of parliament , the @entity28 , was seen as particularly crucial because it is the eurozone 's biggest economy , and its chancellor @entity31 is a key figure in attempts to pull the bloc out of its crisis			1
the bailout fund is being increased after the initial fund , which was put in place after @entity8 's â ‚ ¬ 110 billion bail out last may , was tapped by @entity41 and @entity42 , before @entity8 returned for more help			2
the original fund was meant to stem the crisis but this has not happened			0
instead , the crisis has intensified , feeding global instability and driving the eurozone to the edge of recession			0
the new powers will allow the fund also to buy sovereign bonds in the capital markets , a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves			0
@entity1 's @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 's *lawmakers* passed the measure by a large majority
it is one of a number of @entity6 countries that must ratify the plan
@entity3 's ratification of the expansion plan is key because of its economic power
