-- less than a week before @entity2 , @entity1 had yet to make a starlet 's most scrutinized fashion decision : her @entity2 dress			1
her stylist , the renowned celebrity dresser @entity6 , was n't worried			1
tight deadlines are as common as paparazzi in this industry			1
" what it comes down to is -- may the best dress win , " said @entity11 , whose clients include @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
" i stay organized and maintain close relationships with designers and colleagues , so it 's more fun than stressful			1
" @entity1 , who was asked to present an @entity2 two weeks ago , was measured for a gown four days before the event			1
@entity11 , who researches styles from around the globe , asked : what silhouette ? what color ? what designer ? " my goal was to make her feel beautiful , happy and comfortable , " she said			2
" find the perfect fit			2
" award show culture demands uber - chic attendees , said @entity11			1
resplendent , cutting - edge garbs are expected , or style - driven media like @entity41 's @entity37 assault a celebrity 's outfit with snarky quips			2
" just because she likes rainbow sherbet does n't mean she has to dress like one , " @entity45 said of actress @entity47 's dress after the @entity49 awards in january			2
" i mean , i do n't dress like @entity52 and prunes			2
" @entity11 strives to keep her clients off the " worst dressed " lists			2
even with the pressure of the world watching , she said the " getting ready " process before the annual show is lighthearted			1
@entity1 , who prefers the designs of @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , will likely be surrounded by friends and family , sipping wine and taking pictures			2
@entity11 , like a close girlfriend , will zip her flowing , complicated gown and arrange matching accessories			2
" it 's comparable to a wedding day , " she said			0
" everyone will just be having a good time			0
" after the @entity2 , the fate of an actress ' attire is often similar to a bride 's wedding dress : never to be worn again			1
some custom - made styles worth " tens of thousands of dollars " are returned to designers the next morning , @entity11 said			1
but 80 % of the time , her clients get to keep the dress			0
" after the designers make something so special for an actress , they ' gift ' the dresses , " she said			1
" the dresses get so much press , so who could really wear them again ? " after a dress is gifted , some celebrities donate their famous threads to charity auctions			1
clothes off our backs in @entity100 , @entity101 , raises money from celebrity goods to benefit @entity104 , a hunger - relief effort ; @entity107 , an organization determined to end malaria deaths in @entity109 by 2015 ; @entity110 , a boarding school for escaped child soldiers and more			0
@entity11 said there is endless action behind the scenes before and after award shows			1
" i feel lucky to put together living , breathing art , " she said			0
" dressing clients for the @entity2 is an honor			1
" as for what @entity1 will wear ? " well , we can never say for sure until the actual show , " @entity122 said			1
" so , we 'll see on sunday ! " for those watching the @entity2 from home , the celebrity stylist shares five tips for everyday glamour : 1			1
" no matter what size or shape you are , @entity131 is your best friend			0
" very few things fit perfect off the rack and tailoring makes all the difference			0
it can make a $ 70 white button down from the @entity142 look like a $ 400 dollar fitted @entity144 shirt			0
take a digital photo of yourself in the mirror before going out			0
" you will be shocked to see what the naked eye does n't ! black fabric is see - through when a camera flash hits it			0
no one wants their bra showing in family photos			0
be prepared for mini fashion emergencies			0
" i always carry a needle and thread kit , double - side tape and safety pins in my purse			0
you never know when you or a friend will be stranded			0
be confident ! " when you love the way you look , it translates and people take notice			0
@entity37 is an extension of your personality so have fun and stay true to yourself			0
