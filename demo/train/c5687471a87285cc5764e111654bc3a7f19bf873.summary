editor 's note : @entity2 is a nationally syndicated columnist and a member of the editorial board of the @entity5			1
read his column here @entity2 says people should n't blame their failures on competition from illegal immigrants			1
@entity11 , @entity12 ( @entity13 ) -- here 's the good news : authorities say that fewer illegal immigrants are crossing the @entity19 - @entity18 border			1
the @entity20 recently reported that arrests along the @entity19 - @entity18 border in the last five months are down 24 percent from the same period last year			2
at the current rate , the level of apprehension this year could be the lowest since 1975			0
a big reason is the frightful @entity19 economy			2
after all , you do n't often see people trying to break into a house when the house is on fire			2
some illegal immigrants are even going home to @entity18			1
but here 's the bad news : there are still plenty of illegal immigrants in the @entity19 who have families here , and they are n't leaving			1
and apparently those who are here are , because of the bad economy , more threatening than ever to those low - skilled @entity19 workers who have to compete with them			2
and now this issue has become part of the debate over the economic stimulus law recently signed by president @entity51			2
researchers at @entity53 and the @entity54 ( which favors limiting all immigration , even the legal kind ) estimate that illegal immigrants could fill as many as 300,000 construction jobs			1
that 's about 15 percent of the 2 million jobs that new taxpayer - financed projects are expected to create			0
advocacy groups say there is no way to predict how many jobs might go to illegal immigrants			1
the topic is grist for talk radio and those blood - pressure - raising curmudgeons on cable tv			0
why , they ask , should @entity19 tax dollars go to illegal immigrants ? as if illegal immigrants do n't pay taxes			1
they do -- sales taxes , property taxes , even income taxes thanks to something called an @entity77 ( @entity77 ) , which @entity78 helpfully created to allow those who do n't have valid @entity81 numbers to still dread april 15			2
conservatives are miffed that @entity83 ignored their pleas to require employers who compete for stimulus funds to use the e-verify program			1
run by the @entity90 , that program lets those employers who choose to participate verify the validity of @entity81 numbers provided by new hires			2
but the @entity97 system needs to have its own accuracy verified			0
according to the @entity99 , in 2007 , @entity90 commissioned an independent study of the program , which found that " the database used for verification is still not sufficiently up to date to meet the requirements for accurate verification			0
" the error rate was almost 10 percent			0
someone using a valid social security card that does n't belong to him would go undetected			0
oh , is that all ? i understand that there is a larger issue here			0
as i 've said for the last 15 years of writing about immigration , those who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted and jailed			1
but , in those cases where illegal immigrants squeak by and wind up on the job , @entity19 workers have to compete with them , like it or not			1
and that brings me to what really bothers me about this controversy			0
it 's a sad state of affairs when people who were born in this , the freest and most prosperous country on @entity124 -- instantly becoming @entity19 citizens , no less -- with a free education and every other opportunity to improve their lives find themselves afraid to compete with a group of people who do n't have legal status , often ca n't speak @entity134 , and usually have no more than a 6th - grade education			1
my fellow @entity19 , stop your trembling			2
if you do n't like competing with illegal immigrants , try making better choices			1
stop feeling sorry for yourself			0
turn off those tv shows that constantly bash globalization and immigration			0
move out of the comfort zone of your hometown to take a job in another state , if necessary			0
take responsibility for your own life			0
and stop thinking the world owes you a living			0
that was the " tough love " message i shared with the construction worker who called into a @entity162 , @entity163 , radio show about a year ago to complain that construction firms on the @entity165 were paying the same wage they were 20 years earlier			0
the caller blamed illegal immigrants , who he said were keeping wages low			1
it 's interesting that he did n't blame the companies that employed the firms , or the firms themselves			1
and of course , he never thought to look in the mirror and blame himself for not taking steps to improve his skills in the last 20 years			0
maybe he could have gone into a different line of work long ago			0
i suppose illegal immigrants were to blame for that , too			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : **critics** of stimulus plan say it will employ illegal immigrants
he says **critics** are upset that the e-verify program wo n't be used to check in hiring
@entity2 says those who hire illegal immigrants should be jailed
he says immigrants are n't to blame for @entity19 ' economic failures
