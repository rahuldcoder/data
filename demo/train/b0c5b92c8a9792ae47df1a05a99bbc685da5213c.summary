@entity0 appears to be in his late 20s			0
with a neat ginger beard and a rifle slung over his shoulder , he addresses fellow @entity5 back in @entity6 from his new home in northern @entity8			1
in a 9 - minute video released by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) , he explains that he took his name from @entity12 , because " he hit the head of injustice , and he is the one who terrorized [ the @entity16 ] as they terrorized us			2
since they did not stop doing this , we will treat them in kind			0
" he asks his audience : " are you happy with your life in @entity6 ? going to the nightclubs and having female friends ? " according to a translation of the video by @entity31			2
@entity0 then appeals for @entity5 to join the struggle led by @entity10 leader @entity33			2
addressing @entity33 , he says : " the entire world is against you , because you are inviting to establish the @entity37			0
therefore , we love you and we stand beside you			0
" the message was recorded last november			0
there is no record of @entity42 since then			0
@entity6 media have reported that he is a former pizza delivery driver from a small town in @entity46			2
but just how many have beaten the same path as @entity42 -- from @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 ? and if they come home , will they bring terrorism with them ? @entity10 's ambitions are focused on creating an " emirate " in the parts of @entity8 and @entity59 it now controls , as the first step toward the greater goal of a wider @entity10 caliphate			1
but any @entity66 military action to support the @entity59 government could change that			1
if it chose to , @entity10 could unleash a tide of young men with " clean " passports , fighting or bomb - making skills and unshakeable belief on their home countries			2
in his video , @entity0 said it was the @entity66 who were the terrorists			2
the task of counter-terrorism agencies is complicated by the fact that in many @entity82 states it is not illegal to travel to @entity8			1
after all , these governments are supporting the @entity84 and many who do go are inspired by humanitarian concerns			0
a senior @entity66 official , who spoke to @entity88 on condition of anonymity , said last week that events in @entity8 and @entity59 are dominating discussions in the counter-terrorism community			1
the official said @entity10 was now focused on @entity59 , but " the big concern " was that it will shift its attention to the @entity16 -- identifying , recruiting and training @entity82 individuals to return to their homelands as hardened , combat - trained extremists			1
in january , @entity10 leader @entity33 blamed " jews and @entity108 " for stoking infighting between jihadist groups in @entity8 , adding : " very soon you will be in direct confrontation — you will be forced to do so , @entity106 permitting			1
" a @entity49 - @entity110 extremist , @entity111 , is accused of killing four people at the @entity113 in @entity114 last month			2
when @entity49 police arrested him they also seized a @entity119 rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the @entity10 insignia , according to prosecutors , who said @entity111 spent about a year fighting in @entity8			1
it is not known whether he joined @entity10			0
at best , @entity82 intelligence has a worryingly incomplete picture of who has traveled to join @entity10 and other jihadist groups , despite some success in ascertaining identities through electronic eavesdropping and monitoring social media			1
there is very little first - hand intelligence from @entity59 or @entity8 ; the majority of foreign fighters have traveled via @entity137			1
authorities in @entity49 believe some 800 @entity49 nationals have travelled to @entity8 , or intend to			1
analysts believe as many as 100 @entity66 citizens have made the trek			2
one additional concern : most @entity144 are able to travel to the @entity66 without visas			1
@entity49 and @entity6 citizens have carried out suicide bombings in @entity8 this year			1
so has at least one @entity66			0
last month , 22 - year old @entity148 from @entity48 became the first @entity66 suicide bomber in @entity8 , after joining @entity10 rival and @entity152 affiliate @entity151			1
@entity154 police say they made 40 arrests for @entity8 - related offences in the first three months of this year , almost double the number of the entire previous year			0
@entity158 , head of @entity160 's counter-terrorism command , warned last year there were signs these recruits could be turned around to launch attacks in the @entity154			0
" i do n't think the public realizes the seriousness of the problem , " he said			0
" the penny has n't dropped			0
but @entity8 is a game - changer			0
" fbi director @entity170 said last month : " there 's going to be a diaspora out of @entity8 at some point , and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from @entity8 today to a future 9/11			0
" @entity176 , a fellow at the @entity177 for @entity178 , estimates that almost 3,000 @entity144 citizens have travelled to fight in @entity8			1
many of these young men were drawn to the cause of overthrowing @entity183 and establishing an @entity10 state in part or all of @entity8			1
they see themselves as the foot soldiers of a fledgling @entity10 emirate at the heart of the @entity192 world			0
but now it is @entity10 -- not @entity152 -- that is bringing the dream of a new @entity195 so tantalizingly close			0
if the group can retain even a few of its spectacular gains in @entity59 , adding to the northern parts of @entity8 it already controls , the flow of foreign fighters from the @entity192 world and the @entity16 will likely be turbo - charged			1
@entity10 has already proved adept at releasing a string of propaganda videos featuring foreign fighters			0
so far , the little evidence that has come to light -- mainly from @entity10 's own announcements -- suggests that most suicide bombers in @entity59 have been arabs , including @entity211 , tunisians and @entity213			1
but in march , it celebrated the martyrdom of a @entity215 who had been involved in an attack against an @entity59 army base in @entity219 , north of @entity220			2
another @entity215 detonated a suicide car bomb against @entity59 troops south of @entity224 , and a @entity49 citizen bombed a police headquarters in @entity224 , the group said in may , in a statement translated by @entity31			1
the @entity49 , called @entity228 , had come to @entity59 through @entity8			1
@entity152 in @entity229 taught many @entity144 and @entity66 recruits how to make high - explosive bombs out of readily available materials			2
to date there is no public evidence that @entity10 or @entity151 have provided @entity82 recruits with bomb - making training tailored for " taking home			1
" attacking the @entity16 has not been a priority for either group to date			0
but it would be naïve to think that overt @entity66 military action -- such as air strikes -- against @entity10 fighters in @entity59 would not provoke a response			1
@entity245 , an analyst at @entity246 says the @entity66 would be crossing a red line : " the risk of terrorist attacks in the @entity16 will increase because @entity10 will see any @entity66 intervention as the @entity108 trying to stop an @entity10 state rising			2
" @entity152 operatives in the region , despite their differences with @entity10 , may also step up attempts to hit the @entity16 in the wake of any @entity66 strikes			2
last month the @entity258 stated that @entity259 , a high - ranking @entity260 @entity152 operative previously based in @entity229 was now operating in @entity8 and " part of a group of senior @entity152 members in @entity8 formed to conduct external operations against @entity82 targets			1
" many analysts expect retaliation would be against @entity66 interests overseas , rather than the in homeland itself			0
it has been a growing focus of discussion on jihadist forums			0
@entity66 allies in the region are already concerned about @entity10 spreading its wings			1
in march , @entity260 designated @entity10 a terrorist group ; hundreds of @entity260 are said to have joined the group			2
the challenge posed by @entity10 is compounded by the fact that it treats @entity59 and @entity8 as one theatre of war			1
it has even declared the border as non-existent			0
its fighters have great mobility , and may gain experience of a variety of combat situations			0
and as an organization it has depth			0
" while observers tend to focus on the ' @entity8 foreign fighter issue , ' the problem actually spans two countries			0
@entity59 is now a key part of the same quandary that @entity82 leaders have been attempting to figure out in @entity8 for some time , " says @entity176			1
additionally , @entity10 has shown itself entirely independent -- and highly critical - of @entity297 ' under the leadership of @entity299			0
it has set itself up as the real bearer of @entity12 's legacy , and may be tempted to cement its growing reputation by announcing its reach far beyond @entity224 or @entity304 , its " capital " in @entity8			0
the senior @entity66 official said @entity10 was growing and making a huge name for itself			2
" and what better way to capitalize on that than make a major attack in the @entity16 ? " he added			0
terrifying execution images in @entity59 @entity10 uses social media to wage propaganda war @entity314 : @entity316 's toxic legacy in @entity59 @entity59 crisis pulls in @entity66 and @entity318 as violent militants capture more cities			1

@entity10 militants have taken control of towns in @entity59 and @entity8
the group includes jihadists who have traveled from @entity144 and elsewhere to fight
citizens from @entity49 , @entity6 , @entity215 , @entity66 have carried out bombings in @entity59 and @entity8
security experts are concerned that @entity82 militants may return home to cause chaos
