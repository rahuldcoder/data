@entity1 , @entity0 -- as i watched @entity4 receive the @entity6 award in @entity1 , i could n't help feeling a deep sense of satisfaction , as the 23 year - old @entity10 international once again proved all his doubters wrong			1
@entity4 shows emotion after being named the @entity6 for 2008			1
especially the ones in @entity13			0
in the days leading up to the awards ceremony , there were various rumors circulating that the @entity18 star was going to be pipped by @entity19 on tuesday night			0
i was asked several times in @entity21 whether i really thought @entity4 was going to win			1
whether he really deserved it			0
it was as if many in the @entity26 press did n't want him to take home another award			0
do you think @entity4 is shown enough respect ? tell us in the @entity33 box below			1
the fierce attack on his lifestyle by the tabloids after he crashed his @entity38 last week just accentuated the fact that in the @entity26 , he still has earned little respect			2
never mind that he was about to become the first @entity43 player to win this prestigious award			0
never mind he has been the competition 's biggest ambassador and promoter overseas			1
too many in the @entity13 media , he was still a diver on the field , and a petulant rock star off it			2
now i am not going to sit here and say that my compatriot @entity4 is perfect			2
he is n't and he makes mistakes			0
but the same can be said about @entity54 or any of the other @entity13 internationals			0
when @entity54 charges down the referee and shouts obscenities in his face without even being booked , as was the case in last weekend 's match against @entity61 , is he called arrogant or petulant ? no. when he goes seven or eight matches without a goal , is he suddenly branded overrated ? no. so all i am asking for here is a little respect			2
if @entity4 was @entity13 , i am sure in the eyes of the @entity26 press he would be virtually untouchable , but although he 's not , just give him a break			1
after all , he had an incredible 2007/2008 season which saw him score 42 goals in 49 matches and win virtually every major trophy on offer			0
and he 's a great ambassador for the game			1
