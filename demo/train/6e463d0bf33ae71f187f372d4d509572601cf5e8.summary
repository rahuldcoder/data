@entity0 , @entity1 -- if the @entity4 were contested among continents instead of countries , the tournament would have had only two winners in its 80 - year history : @entity9 and @entity10			1
and now that the @entity11 beat @entity12 , the only @entity9 team left standing in the final four , @entity10 has emerged victorious			1
this year , all the signs in the host country said " @entity17 2010			0
" but for most of june , some graffiti artist painted an me over the f on each of those banners , for what we were witnessing at the beginning was , in essence , @entity9 2010			2
@entity9 dominated from the opening kickoff concert , headlined by @entity28 , the pop star from @entity29			2
even before that , staring vacantly from the covers of countless previews , was the @entity4 's @entity33 , @entity34 of @entity35			1
and even before that , five - time champion @entity36 was expected to do what the @entity36 always do			0
like @entity41 , they wear yellow shirts and crush @entity10			0
for three weeks , @entity35 's manager - mascot , @entity44 -- rosary wrapped around his fist , like brass knuckles -- strode the touchline like a sub-compact colossus			0
refulgent in his shiny suit and diamond earrings , his black - and - white beard ablaze , @entity44 carried off soccer balls and very nearly the entire show before his team came up against @entity57 in the quarterfinals			1
@entity59 , the former @entity60 and @entity61 midfielder turned @entity63 analyst , spoke for many viewers when he said before that match : " i want to see the little lunatic , @entity44 , running up and down the touchline , so i 've got him to beat the @entity70 team on his own			0
" as recently as those quarterfinals , there was the real possibility that all four teams in the semis would be from @entity9 , winners of nine @entity77			2
@entity10 , winners of the other nine , might be shut out of this rubber match			2
past champions @entity80 , @entity82 and @entity83 had crashed out early to varying degrees of domestic condemnation : @entity86 ( the @entity87 ) , cataclisma ( the @entity88 ) , catastrophe ( the @entity90 )			0
but a funny thing happened on the way to the semis : @entity11 came from behind in the second half to beat @entity36			1
then the rest of @entity10 did the same , coming from behind in the second half of the @entity4 to assert its dominance over @entity9 , most emphatically when @entity35 lost 4 - 0 to the free - scoring @entity70 , who suddenly seem to be the new @entity36 , soccer 's latest thing , its -- how 's this for etymological irony ? -- bossa nova			1
as a result , the only @entity9 team in the final four was two - time champion @entity12			1
and even then , the most effective @entity108 at the tournament was a referee			0
@entity83 's @entity111 scored an obvious goal against @entity57 , but play was waved on by @entity108 ref @entity114			0
in missing the goal , @entity114 almost certainly ushered in a long - overdue era of instant replay or other goal - line technology to assist officials			0
as for the @entity12 team , it needed a miracle to beat @entity122 in one of the most improbable finishes to a sporting event we will see in this century			1
@entity128 's penalty kick on the final play of the game rocketed off the crossbar to spare @entity9 one spot in the semifinals among three elite @entity10 teams : @entity57 , @entity103 and the @entity11			1
but tuesday , time was up for @entity12			2
it lost to the @entity137 3 - 2 , helping the @entity11 make its first @entity4 title match since 1978			1
@entity9 has already secured a @entity4 trophy in 2010			1
the other day at the airport in @entity143 , @entity29 officials seized a gold - painted replica of the famous @entity147 trophy			0
it was made entirely of cocaine			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

@entity152 : @entity4 winners for 80 years have come from @entity9 or @entity10
this year @entity9 seemed strong , he says ; @entity36 and @entity35 *powerhouses*
but @entity137 beat @entity36 ; @entity57 beat @entity35 ; @entity103 in final 4
tuesday , @entity137 beat @entity12 , the only @entity9 team left standing
