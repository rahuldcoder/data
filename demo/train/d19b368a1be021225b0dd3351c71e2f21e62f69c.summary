-- the @entity1 has warned a company that markets caffeine and vitamin b as " breathable energy " it could face regulatory action over " false and misleading " labeling			1
@entity9 comes in a lipstick - shaped dispenser that puffs out the white powdery mixture			2
pre-filled devices can be purchased online or in convenience stores in @entity14 and @entity15 for about $ 3			0
@entity9 's website says the product " gives you a higher level of freedom and control that you can only get from airborne energy			1
" however , elsewhere it explains , " the powder in @entity9 reaches your mouth where it is swallowed and ingested			1
" " your labeling is false and misleading because your product can not be intended for both inhalation and ingestion , " the @entity1 charges in a letter to the manufacturer @entity32			1
" consumers may attempt to inhale your product , causing it to enter the lungs			2
@entity1 is concerned about the safety of any such use			2
" the @entity9 packaging says the product is " not recommended for people ... under 18			2
" but the @entity1 noted that the @entity9 website refers to " hitting the books " and " studying in the library " as activities that presumably could be enhanced by using the product			1
" these activities are commonly performed by children and adolescents , " the letter says			0
" indeed , your reference to these activities seems to target this population			0
" the @entity1 also expressed concern over @entity9 's posting of news clips on its website that refer to the mixing of the product with alcohol as a party drug			1
" even though these news items express health concerns about taking @entity9 while drinking alcohol , your posting of the news items on the website where you promote and sell @entity9 publicizes such use , " the letter states			2
" we plan to work closely with the @entity1 to meet their requests for information and labeling changes to ensure compliance with dietary supplement requirements , " @entity69 , ceo of @entity32 , said in a statement			1
" @entity9 delivers a mix of b vitamins and caffeine to the mouth for ingestion and is not ' inhaled ' into the lungs			1
@entity9 is not recommended or marketed to persons under 18 or for use with alcohol			2
" the @entity1 is giving @entity32 15 working days to respond to the warning letter			1
" you should take prompt action to correct the violations cited above , " the agency said in the letter			0
" failure to do so may result in regulatory action without further notice			1
such action may include , but is not limited to , seizure or injunction			0
" in february , product inventor @entity98 told @entity0 it was safe and " thoroughly tested " before it was introduced			0
" there are energy shots on the market that have 10 times the amount of caffeine in a single energy shot than we have in the @entity9			2
... the fact is we do n't have that much caffeine in the product , " he said			0
one @entity9 contains 100 milligrams of caffeine dispensed in three to six " puffs			0
" " for most healthy adults , moderate doses of caffeine -- 200mg to 300mg , or about two to four cups of brewed coffee a day -- are n't harmful , " according to the @entity120			0
it warns that more than 500 - 600 milligrams daily can cause problems such as insomnia , elevated heart rate , muscle tremors and stomach upset			0
@entity127 sen. @entity126 , @entity128 - @entity14 , sent a letter in december urging the @entity1 to examine the safety and legality of @entity9			1
" the bottom line is this product asks more questions than we have answers , and to have it on our shelves before those questions are answered is a serious , serious , serious mistake , " he said in a news conference in february			0
@entity9 falls under @entity1 regulations for dietary supplements			1
those products include vitamin c pills , some weight loss products and certain energy drinks			0
the company making them is responsible " for determining that the dietary supplements it manufactures or distributes are safe and that any representations or claims made about them are substantiated by adequate evidence to show that they are not false or misleading , " according to the @entity1 website			1
it 's rare for the agency to prohibit a supplement			0
in 2004 , it stopped the sale of the diet supplement @entity162 , but only after deaths and other serious side effects were reported .			0

@entity9 's labeling is " false and misleading , " @entity1 says
marketing seems to imply supplement can be inhaled , @entity1 says
breathable energy says product is ingested , " not ' inhaled ' into the lungs "
@entity1 gives company 15 working days to respond or face possible regulatory action
