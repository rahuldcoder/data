-- in a city where football is a religion , @entity1 is fast becoming a deity			1
the @entity8 striker 's skyward salute -- he is a committed @entity9 -- has become a familiar sight around @entity12 grounds , with the 24 - year - old netting 18 league goals so far this season			1
with nine goals in nine league matches this year , scoring has come easy			2
explaining his hot streak , however , is a bit more difficult			0
" i 'm not too sure , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity22			2
" i just think that i 've had my faith in @entity24 , been praying a lot , been working hard on the training field , and expressing myself , playing my natural game and playing my natural position also			0
" a switch from the wing -- where his former club @entity31 often deployed him -- to a more central attacking role at @entity8 has transformed @entity1 's scoring fortunes			1
the statistics speak for themselves : 13 goals in 63 league appearances during four years at @entity38 compared to 28 from 35 games in the 14 months since completing his Â £ 12 million ( $ 20 million ) move to @entity41			0
goals and a blossoming partnership with @entity45 striker @entity44 have propelled @entity1 to new heights of stardom , but his nimble feet remain firmly planted on the ground			1
" maybe off the pitch it 's changed in terms of people paying more attention , but in terms of myself and my family and my friends nothing has changed , " he says			0
" i live the same lifestyle , i 'm the same old happy self that i 've been in my whole life			0
" @entity1 and @entity44 have netted 43 times in the league this season , but come june 19 they will likely be lining up against each other when @entity67 take on @entity45 at the @entity68 in @entity69			1
" it will be strange but i 'm looking forward to it , " @entity1 says of the @entity71 clash			2
" we play against each other in training and we have a lot of battles , but come game time we will be enemies and he 'll be somebody that i 'll be looking to take out if necessary because we got to win the game			2
" @entity1 's renaissance at club level has also been mirrored on the international stage , where he 's gone from fringe player to first - team regular			1
his fifth @entity67 goal in this month 's 1 - 0 friendly win against @entity88 at @entity89 merely confirmed his growing stature and confidence ahead of the trip to @entity93			0
" it 's gon na be great to be involved in the @entity68 because it 's something i 've dreamed of ... it 's gon na be a great occasion and as i 've said , if i 'm selected , i 'm looking forward to it , " he says			2
the priority now , though , is on domestic matters as @entity8 continue their quest for a first league title in 24 years			1
sunday 's 3 - 0 drubbing of @entity104 at @entity105 was @entity8 's fifth straight league win and confirmed @entity109 ' team as genuine title contenders , although @entity1 refuses to be drawn on the subject			1
" i think it 's important that we just go out there , work as hard as we can as a team in every game and perceive what the future holds , " he told @entity0 before the victory over @entity8 's northwest rivals			0
@entity1 can look forward to home clashes against two of his former clubs -- league - leading @entity31 and @entity124 , the bookmakers ' favorite -- as the @entity12 title race heads down the final straight in april			1
" we 're gon na play them both at @entity41			0
it 's going to be a great occasion for myself and for the fans and my teammates of course			0
but it 's important that we go out there and play the @entity8 way and enjoy it , " he says			1
win those two games and @entity8 fans will be on the verge of @entity12 heaven .			0

@entity1 says his faith has helped him hit top form for @entity8
the 24 - year - old and strike partner @entity44 will play each other at 2014 @entity68
@entity1 and @entity44 have *powered* @entity8 this season with 43 goals between them
three - time @entity154 champion seeking first @entity155 since 1990
