in " @entity8 " @entity9 , @entity0 said he felt threatened by a car full of teens playing loud music and pumped about 10 rounds from his 9 mm pistol into their suv , killing 17 - year - old @entity7			1
there were , of course , no return shots , because the teens were unarmed			1
@entity0 is white , and all the teens in the car were black			1
he did n't bother to call the police afterward			0
@entity0 , 47 , is on trial , charged with murder			1
he took the stand monday , detailing how he was pulled up at a gas station when he asked the teens to turn down the music -- " rap crap " he called it			1
through the teenagers ' tinted windows he saw menace , someone reaching for something			0
" you 're not going to kill me , you son of a b * * * h , " @entity0 recalled saying as he reached for his loaded gun in his glove box			1
and he only " stopped firing when it appeared the threat was over			0
" under @entity9 's " @entity8 " law , which could be used in this case , you are granted immunity from criminal and civil charges -- even if you did n't first try to retreat -- if you can show you had a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm or death			1
and reasonable is up to interpretation			0
a 2012 study by @entity44 found that in the " @entity8 " states , when white shooters kill black people , " 34 % of the resulting homicides are deemed justifiable			1
only 3 % of deaths are ruled justifiable when the shooter is black and the victim is white			1
" and @entity0 feels justified			1
" i am not a murderer , " @entity0 has said			1
instead , he has taken on the mantle of victimhood and claimed , " i am a survivor			0
" @entity0 saw black and @entity0 saw " threat			1
" and he still does			0
he wrote , while awaiting trial , " this jail is full of blacks , and they all act like thugs			0
... this may sound a bit radical , but if more people would arm themselves and kill these * * * * idiots when they 're threatening you , eventually they may take the hint and change their behavior			0
" but it 's not just the vigilantes			1
in january , @entity70 police determined that a group of @entity73 teens wearing hats and scarves in 13 degree weather looked " suspicious			1
" the resulting stop and frisk led to the crushed testicles of a straight - a student who was simply on his way to a high school basketball game			0
he is now in a wheelchair			0
recently , researchers at @entity86 conducted studies where police and others , cued with an image of a black person , quickly deciphered very blurred images often associated with crime , such as a gun			1
white people see an @entity73 , and they 're immediately looking for something illegal			1
they almost instantly see a threat			0
@entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and the scores of other unarmed @entity73 gunned down because the killers felt threatened make that clear			1
still , there 's another story			2
the toll that the assumption of white innocence has on public safety is rarely examined			2
for example , years ago in @entity113 , one of @entity112 's young victims ran naked , bleeding and screaming into the arms of @entity116 's finest			2
but the serial killer 's blond hair worked like pixie dust : the officers ignored the pleas of several @entity73 women , who begged the police to protect the child and get him to safety			2
instead , the cops took @entity112 's word that this frail 14 - year - old @entity129 boy was really a consenting adult and handed the child back over to the cannibal			2
for most @entity73 , danger does n't look like @entity112			0
the second part of the same study at @entity86 affirmed it			0
researchers found when they flashed pictures of whites to police and others , subsequent fuzzy images linked to crime remained a blur for a lot longer			0
in the @entity149 psyche of @entity150 , the words " white " and " crime " are not synonymous			2
this means that authorities are slow to recognize the threat even of serial killers and certainly by gun - toting shooters in neighborhoods , malls , schools , and airports -- if they 're white			1
the ability of white skin to mask a threat was evident in @entity163 last year			2
in october , a white man pulled up to an elementary school and breezed through an elaborate security system while packing multiple guns , including an @entity168 , and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition			2
eight hundred children scrambled out of the building and a swat team set up outside			0
then , @entity174 pointed his gun out the school window and started shooting			0
as dramatic as the shootings may be , the assumption of white innocence has a more widespread , corrosive effect on the criminal justice system and society			2
the @entity183 has documented evidence that the relatively small number of whites who were stopped and frisked accounted for nearly twice as many illegal firearms and one - third more contraband than blacks or @entity190			0
still , deputy inspector @entity191 instructed his officers to target @entity73			0
" i do n't have any trouble telling you this , " he said , " male blacks 14 to 20 , 21			0
" in other words , where the presumption of white innocence is concerned , facts carry much less weight than perception			1
similarly , whites and @entity205 are two - thirds of all crack users in the @entity150 ; yet , the @entity203 found that 79 % of sentenced crack offenders in 2009 were black			2
as journalist @entity209 noted , " when it comes to illegal drug use , white america does the crime , black @entity150 gets the time			1
" law professor @entity214 wrote about the ways that the @entity73 obsession with crime has created " a culture of fear			0
" yet , any sense of real safety and security will continue to elude this nation as long black is the default threat setting in @entity150 .			0

@entity0 says he was justified in killing black teen because he felt threatened
@entity228 : @entity0 thinks he 's a victim even though teens had no weapons
she names @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 -- all gunned down
she says " white " is seen as innocent , " black " carries presumption of being a thug
