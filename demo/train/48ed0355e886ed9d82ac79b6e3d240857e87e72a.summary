-- even if they do n't admit it , most people know when they 're hammered			2
but they may not always know when they 're legally drunk			0
if states heed the new recommendations of the @entity6 , it will be easier for motorists in the @entity8 to be arrested for drunken driving			1
the @entity6 wants states to reduce the blood - alcohol content threshold used by law enforcement to prosecute drunken driving from 0.08 to 0.05			1
in plainer language , that means drivers could be subject to arrest after downing as few as two recent drinks			1
how do you know when it 's safe to get behind the wheel and when you should hand the keys to someone else ? here are some tech tools that can help			0
blood - alcohol calculators if you have access to a computer , there are sites that can estimate your blood - alcohol level			1
you enter information such as your body weight , the types of drinks you 've had and how long you 've been drinking , and these online calculators will spit out a number			0
for example , a 180 - pound man typically will hit the 0.05 threshold after two or three drinks over an hour , according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the @entity41			1
but a 125 - pound woman would register an estimated 0.092 after three glasses of wine over the same period , according to @entity46 , whose slogan is " check yourself before you wreck yourself			1
" if you 'd prefer to estimate your @entity46 on your phone , there are calculator apps such as @entity51 and @entity52			2
keep in mind that these numbers are only estimates and that many factors besides gender and weight influence a person 's blood - alcohol content			1
do n't treat the results as legal advice			0
hand - held breathalyzers breathalyzers are n't just for law enforcement anymore			2
many manufacturers make small , hand - held versions for people who want to monitor their alcohol intake , or just use them for party games			1
the battery - powered gadgets , about the size of a cellphone , contain a breath tube and an internal alcohol sensor that gives instantaneous readings			1
prices range from $ 4 for a one - time disposable model to $ 29 for small keychain devices to $ 200 or more for more sophisticated " professional " models used by police			2
beware , however : some of the cheaper models have been known to produce inconsistent readings			0
the pricier ones employ fuel - cell sensors , which turn your breath into electrical current that can be precisely measured for levels of booze			1
the devices are available at sites such as @entity94 and @entity95			0
apps / devices for your phone if you 're looking for a less expensive alternative and want to track your results online , these may be for you			2
@entity103 - size devices such as the @entity104 and the @entity106 plug into the audio jack of your @entity108 or @entity110 phone			2
you download the accompanying app , blow into the device 's mouthpiece and view the results on your phone			0
there 's only one problem : they 're not readily available yet			0
the @entity104 is available for pre-order for $ 49 and will ship to customers this fall			0
the first batch of the $ 75 @entity121 sold out , and devices ordered now wo n't be delivered until at least october			0
when used over time , the apps give you a history of your drink consumption and blood - alcohol levels to help you understand how your body reacts to alcohol			1
( in case you did n't know			0
) if you 've had too much , you can also call a taxi via the @entity106 app. a similar $ 149 device , the @entity134 , works wirelessly with your phone via @entity136 and is available now .			0
