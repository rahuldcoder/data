-- after months of rumor roundups and speculation , @entity2 's ipad mini has finally been announced — and the 7 - inch tablet market has just heated up			1
this growing product category now has more to offer than @entity8 devices with differing @entity10 skins and varying components — or that @entity12 that 's not selling too hot			0
that 's not to say that @entity2 's entrance into the mini-tablet game is solely what 's fueling the fire			2
up until now , only the first - generation @entity18 and the recently launched @entity19 were considered worthy buys			2
add the ipad mini to the mix , and this particular product category has a little more steam			0
but not everyone wants a $ 329 ipad mini , and there are certainly other 7 - inch tablets that are worthy options			1
or not , depending on your specific needs			0
to help you out , we 've put together this roundup of 7 - inch tablets that are slated to arrive soon or are already available for purchase			1
if you 're the " tl ; @entity39 " type , scroll down to the bottom and check out the comparison chart for a quick cheat sheet			0
@entity40 7 @entity40 's flagship @entity19 tablet has done well by our standards and it 's quite a deal at $ 200			1
built on the internals of the @entity45 370 , the tablet has a 1280 × 800 ips display with 226ppi , a @entity49 quad - core processor , @entity50 of @entity51 , up to @entity52 of internal storage ( with a rumored @entity55 model on its way ) , and a 1.3mp front - facing camera			2
it also comes with a stock version of @entity8 4.1 @entity62 , and because it 's @entity40 - backed , it 's ensured that it will be supported for future @entity8 updates			2
our benchmarks show that it 's one of the speediest 7 - inch tablets currently available			1
@entity67 the first iteration of the @entity18 did exceedingly well , but its successor has left a bit to be desired			0
the @entity67 , priced at $ 199 ( or $ 214 for the ad - free version ) , comes with a @entity49 dual - core @entity73 processor , @entity50 of @entity51 , and a 1280 × 800 display — the same resolution as @entity40 's @entity19			1
it comes preloaded with @entity79 's appstore , which has limited offerings compared to the @entity82 store , and it runs a custom version of @entity84 , an @entity8 version behind its major competitors			2
this device is best suited for those who devour e-books or are especially invested in the @entity79 ecosystem			0
@entity90 @entity91 is slated to update its nook tablet this holiday season ; the device will be available for preorder for $ 199 beginning november 1			0
the @entity90 includes a 1440 × 900 resolution and a 243ppi display — putting it within a stone 's throw of the @entity100 's 264ppi retina display — and is fueled by a @entity102 dual - core omap 4470 processor			0
like the @entity67 , it will also come with its own skinned version of @entity84 , and will be best suited for committed consumers of the @entity91 e-book store			0
however , it 's important to note that unlike @entity79 's @entity67 , @entity107 and @entity108 's @entity90 will not require the extra $ 15 to enjoy it without advertisements			1
@entity110 @entity110 is n't new to the tablet game			0
its @entity113 series includes the 10.1 - inch @entity114 and @entity116 tablets , but the @entity110 marks the company 's second foray into the 7 - inch product category			1
the @entity110 will come with a @entity49 3 processor and run @entity8 4.1 @entity62 , though it will be limited to a 1024 × 600 display — a major fumble in a tablet world overrun by competing devices with higher resolution displays			0
it also features a microsd expansion slot and @entity127 , but for $ 229 — one of the more costly of the 7 - inch tablets in this roundup — the @entity110 will need to offer a lot more than expandable storage to stay a player in the game			1
@entity135 the @entity100 now comes in a 7.9 - inch " mini " flavor , which makes it one of the largest of the mini-tablets			1
it 's got all the aesthetics of its 9.7 - inch counterpart , though it 's limited by its non-retina 1024 × 768 display			1
the ipad mini is also incredibly thin — just 7.2mm thin , 23 % thinner than the @entity100			0
if you 're already a faithful @entity2 user , you wo n't have to leave the ecosystem			0
it comes in different flavors ( @entity149 for $ 329 , @entity55 for $ 429 , and @entity151 for $ 519 ) , so onboard storage is n't an issue , and you can purchase an @entity155 - capable model for $ 130 more — a feature that a majority of the tablets featured in this round - up do not offer			2
but the $ 329 base price is significantly higher than the competition , and the 1024x768 display resolution is n't much better than the @entity163 and pales in comparison to that of the @entity90 's 1440x900 and the 1280x800 @entity19 and @entity67			1

@entity2 's @entity135 joins the 7 - inch tablet market
@entity79 's @entity67 , @entity40 's @entity19 are among current *leaders*
@entity2 's display screen is bigger than the others , but $ 329 price tag is bigger , too
