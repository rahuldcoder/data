@entity0 -- @entity2 has n't backed a @entity3 for president in 44 years , but economic concerns and changing demographics are giving sen. @entity7 a chance to steal the once reliably red state from @entity10			1
sen. @entity7 waves as rain falls on a rally in @entity14 , @entity2 , in late september			1
polls earlier this year showed sen. @entity16 , the @entity10 presidential nominee , leading @entity7 , his @entity17 rival , in @entity2 by a healthy margin			1
a @entity20 poll taken may 12 - 18 had @entity16 leading 47 percent to 39 percent			1
but as the financial crisis has shaken voters ' confidence in the economy , @entity7 has begun to open a lead in the state , as he has done in other battleground states			0
the latest @entity1 poll of polls has @entity7 leading @entity16 49 percent to 45 percent			1
a @entity1 / time / @entity31 poll conducted september 28 - 30 shows @entity7 with an even bigger lead over @entity16 , 53 percent to 44 percent			1
the @entity1 poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points			0
polls show that voters have more confidence in @entity7 to handle the economic crisis than they do in @entity16 , and are more likely to blame @entity10 for the recent turmoil than @entity17			1
beside an advantage on the economy , @entity7 is also benefiting from a demographic shift that has reshaped @entity2 politics			2
for the last 10 presidential elections , @entity10 have been able to bank on @entity2 delivering its 13 electoral votes to the @entity10			0
president @entity48 won @entity2 by 8 percentage points in both 2000 and 2004 , and president @entity50 was never able to capture the state when he ran in 1992 and 1996			0
but the explosive growth of @entity2 in the last decade has changed the state 's electorate			2
drawn by government jobs in nearby @entity0 and high - tech jobs in the @entity59 corridor , the growing population in @entity2 is more liberal than the mostly rural southern portion of the state , which has remained reliably @entity10			1
in 2000 , @entity48 carried @entity2 49 percent to 47 percent , but in 2004 , sen. @entity62 , the @entity17 presidential nominee , carried the area 51 percent to 48 percent			1
@entity2 " is not as red as people think , " said @entity64 , a conservative talk show host for @entity67 radio			0
" a third of the population in @entity2 is pretty liberal			2
a lot of people are buying into [ @entity7 's ] notion of change			2
" @entity2 @entity17 have been able to exploit the changes in the electorate into statewide electoral success after years in which the @entity10 had a virtual lock on the state			0
in fact , @entity2 @entity10 have not won a statewide race since @entity82 , a former mobile phone company executive , captured the governorship for the @entity17 in 2001 by emphasizing economic growth			2
democrat @entity86 , who was @entity82 's lieutenant governor , succeeded @entity82 in 2005			0
and in what may have been the most surprising result of the 2006 election cycle , democrat @entity87 defeated the incumbent @entity10 @entity91 in the race for one of @entity2 's seats in the @entity95			2
the trend favoring the @entity17 is expected to continue this year , which is expected to help drive @entity2 @entity17 to the polls			2
the extremely popular @entity82 is almost certain to win this year 's race against another former governor , @entity10 @entity100 , to replace @entity2 's long - standing @entity10 senator , @entity100 , who is retiring			0
( the two @entity102 are not related , and @entity100 was unopposed in 2002			0
) a @entity104 poll conducted in late september found @entity82 leading @entity100 by 30 points , and @entity82 's victory would give @entity17 control of both of @entity2 's seats in the @entity95 for the first time since 1970			1
while conservatives may be demoralized by @entity100 's poor showing , @entity16 may also face eroding support from @entity2 conservatives for his recent proposals for the government to become heavily involved in the @entity118 economy , said @entity64 , the radio talk show host			1
during tuesday night 's presidential debate , @entity16 suggested that the government directly buy up to $ 300 billion in home mortgages to help homeowners facing foreclosure			0
@entity64 said that proposal , along with his support for a $ 700 billion bailout package to help @entity129 firms that @entity16 voted for last week , are two signs that @entity16 is breaking from the free - market principles that @entity2 conservatives support and not stopping " the march toward socialism " that has begun since the economic crisis started			1
" they missed a real opportunity , certainly , in @entity2 with my listeners who say they want someone who is fiscally conservative , " said @entity64 , who added that he 's considering voting for a third - party candidate			0
" they could have come out and said , ' no more spending			0
' " @entity1 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
