-- lawyers for groups opposed to same - sex marriage in @entity4 petitioned to reverse a federal appeals court order that ok 'd the resumption of such unions -- doing so a day after that ruling			1
attorneys applied saturday to the @entity11 @entity10 for " an immediate order vacating " a decision friday by the @entity14 , according to copies of the document from @entity17 and the @entity18			1
that appeals court friday lifted a previous injunction on same - sex marriages in @entity4 , " effective immediately			1
" " without the immediate relief requested by this application , the @entity14 will circumvent the proper rules and procedures established by this court , " the application says			2
those on the other side of the debate , meanwhile , think the appeals court acted appropriately			0
" the @entity14 had broad discretion as to whether to stay the injunction pending appeal , " said @entity32 , a spokesman for the @entity33			0
" now that the @entity10 has decided that the injunction against @entity39 must stand , it was entirely appropriate for the @entity14 to dissolve its stay of that injunction			1
" @entity4 's @entity10 struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage in may 2008 , ruling that the state 's constitution gives " this basic civil right to ( marry to ) all @entity4 , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples			1
" but months later , 52 % of voters backed proposition 8 to once again restrict marriages so that they can only be between a man and a woman			0
the measure put gay and lesbian marriages on hold , though lawsuits followed			0
state officials declined to stand behind @entity39 -- and , thus , its prohibition on gay marriage -- though private parties did step in and offer to do so			0
a federal appeals court later ruled that @entity39 was unconstitutional , though it still issued a stay on same - sex marriages until the @entity11 @entity10 could weigh in			1
that happened in a 5 - 4 decision wednesday , when the high court dismissed an appeal of that federal court ruling on jurisdictional grounds			2
that meant friday 's news -- the resumption of same - sex marriages in @entity4 -- was expected , even though it was n't known when it would happen			1
@entity10 cases rest of citizens who sued , made history @entity17 and @entity18 say it should n't have happened then , at the least			0
in their emergency application , affiliated lawyers claimed the @entity14 " lacked jurisdiction to issue its order purporting to dissolve the stay			2
" they reasoned that this appeals court was n't authorized to weigh in until the @entity10 " sends a certified copy of the judgment to the @entity14			1
" among other arguments , the application also stated that " permitting the @entity14 to prematurely dissolve its stay order would effectively deprive petitioners of a meaningful opportunity to exercise their right to petition for rehearing			0
" such petitions for the @entity10 to reconsider a case must be filed within 25 days after a ruling has been made			0
it 's unclear if and / or when the high court might consider this request			0
justices recently began a recess after issuing a number of pivotal rulings last week			0
and there 's no immediate indication it will have any impact on same - sex weddings taking place around @entity4			1
gov. @entity113 issued a directive on friday telling authorities in " 58 @entity4 counties that same - sex marriage is now legal in @entity4 and that marriage licenses must be issued to same - sex couples immediately			1
" attorney general @entity121 , in fact , performed one of the first such unions -- between @entity124 and @entity125 , who were one of the couples who sued to stop a voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage from taking effect -- at @entity131 's @entity130			2
process begins to allow federal benefits for same - sex spouses @entity0 's @entity135 contributed to this report .			2

lawyers : @entity14 should n't have lifted a stay on same - sex marriages in @entity4
they ask for " an immediate order " vacating that decision , after which weddings resumed
a gay rights spokesman says the appeals court 's actions were " entirely proper "
@entity11 @entity10 paved the way for the appeals court 's move with a ruling wednesday
