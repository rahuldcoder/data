-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 is expected to secure a major currency conversion deal with her nation 's number one trading partner as she begins a six - day visit to @entity7 friday			1
the deal has ramifications beyond @entity12 - @entity11 ties as a step towards full convertibility of the yuan on international markets , denting the primacy of the @entity19 dollar as the world 's reserve currency of choice			1
currently , @entity7 and @entity2 companies must use the @entity19 dollar as an intermediary for trade			1
the @entity2 leader also faces the task of assuring @entity7 that her nation 's growing defense agreements with the @entity19 pose no threat to @entity12			1
" i do n't view us as being in a position where the strong and growing relationship we have with @entity7 is somehow in contest , or in contrast , to the relationship we have with the @entity19 , " @entity1 said thursday at a @entity32 lunch in @entity33 , ahead of her departure			1
leading what she called the " most senior @entity2 political delegation " ever to visit @entity7 , prime minister @entity1 will also be amongst the first western leaders to meet @entity7 's new president @entity45			1
the @entity2 delegation includes the foreign minister , @entity48 , trade minister @entity49 and financial services minister @entity50			0
" the timing of this visit so soon after the new leadership has entered office is deliberate and reflects the importance of our rapidly evolving relationship with @entity7 and our high - level political oversight of that relationship , " prime minister @entity1 said			1
the visit is primarily aimed at furthering the @entity2 governments ambition for greater engagement with @entity63 -- and @entity7 in particular -- as outlined in a major policy paper released in october			1
" @entity2 in the @entity74 " acknowledged @entity2 's economic prosperity was tied @entity63 and it detailed a set of objectives to be achieved in order for @entity2 to boost its wealth by taking advantage of the rise of a massive @entity63 middle class			0
@entity2 's dependence on @entity7 as it marches toward global economic dominance has been clear for many years now			2
in 2011 - 12 , @entity7 was again @entity2 's largest two - way trading partner for goods and services , with trade topping $ 128 billion			1
@entity7 accounts for 14.7 % of the total trade of goods and services and takes one quarter of @entity2 exports , much of it in raw materials			2
significant @entity2 exports of coal and liquid gas are used to power @entity7 industry , but @entity2 suppliers are facing increasing pressure from @entity19 and @entity93 rivals			2
" it 's a competitive world and you 're right , the amount of competition in the energy sector is getting stronger and stronger and more and more acute , " she said			0
" i am very confident that we can be very good at what we do			0
i think we 're very good now and we are always going to have to look for the innovations that make us an even better quality supplier , " she added			0
under the currency deal that prime minister @entity1 is expected to announce whilst in @entity107 , the @entity104 would become directly convertible to @entity7 yuan , overcoming the need to first convert to @entity19 dollars			1
this would remove expensive exchange rate issues , cutting the cost to @entity2 of doing business in @entity7 , though the prime minister remained coy when asked to confirm the deal			2
" you are going to have to wait until i 'm in @entity107 , " she told the @entity32 luncheon			0
with the @entity7 economy expected to grow at about 8 % this year , the currency deal would be an important and much needed political bonus for the struggling @entity1 government in an election year			1
she did however warn that the @entity2 dollar was expected to remain high due to @entity7 demand and the perception that @entity2 is a safe currency haven			1
" @entity104 to @entity19 dollar exchanges are now estimated to be the fifth highest traded currencies in the world , " she said			2
@entity1 will also take the stage at the @entity131 on @entity132 where the world 's business leaders and economic thinkers will gather to hear from @entity7 's senior policy makers			2
later , in @entity12 , she will meet with president @entity45 , to discuss what she termed @entity2 's position as an " energy superpower , " as well as regional defense and security issues			0
@entity2 's decision to permit @entity19 marines to be stationed on its soil as part of @entity147 's refocus on the @entity148 has upset @entity12			0
ahead of the 16th annual @entity2 - @entity150 later this year and a @entity7 navy ship visit for the @entity152 , the @entity2 government is also working on agreements to allow @entity19 naval and aircraft access to @entity2			1
but prime minister @entity1 there is no competition between the @entity19 and @entity7 for @entity2 's attention and allegiance			1
" we will continue to do what we 've done for some period of time - to attend to our friendship and alliance with the @entity19 while growing our friendship with @entity7 , " she added			2
tension resulting from @entity168 's threat to launch missile attacks against @entity19 allies in its neighborhood and even against the @entity19 mainland also is expected to be raised			0
foreign minister @entity48 told @entity174 television that @entity2 will seek information from the @entity7 leadership			0
" we will raise with @entity7 our concerns that if the provocative and bellicose behavior of @entity168 continues , then it will simply result in rising tensions in north - east @entity63 and put @entity180 and @entity181 in a position where they will pay more attention to their security , " he said			0
" @entity7 has a keen interest in seeing that the provocative behavior by @entity168 comes to an end			0
" regardless of pressing international geo - politics , domestic issues are never far away			0
although meeting president @entity45 is expected to bolster prime minister @entity1 's image at home where she has been criticized for being uncomfortable on the world stage and disinterested in international affairs , her political opposition have taken aim			0

she said the visa category was delivering jobs that could go to @entity2 , to foreign workers , leaving supporters and critics alike condemning her for buying into a divisive and long running race debate			0
on the eve of her departure for @entity7 , the opposition coalition leader , @entity216 said that the prime minister is " very interested in the @entity63 century when she 's traveling to @entity63 , but when it comes to skilled migration , a totally different story			0
