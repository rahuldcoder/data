-- @entity2 immigration reform has so far eluded president @entity3			1
but with his re-election victory in battleground states propelled by strong @entity10 support , @entity4 and @entity5 in @entity6 have a stronger interest in cultivating support from a group with growing political clout			1
here are five reasons why the time may be right for immigration reform to take hold in @entity18			1
1 ) the voters have spoken immigration reform may not have been the biggest issue in the election -- the economy was paramount -- but it is very important to a key segment of voters			1
latino voters turned out in force and helped to tip battleground states in @entity3 's favor			1
the number of registered @entity31 has increased by 26 % in the past four years to 12.2 million , or 8.7 % of all voters			2
that means this demographic will only increase its political power			0
issues important to this minority logically will become increasingly important to both major political parties			0
a new electorate has arrived 2 ) @entity3 promised but failed to deliver on immigration reform @entity3 promised to push for immigration reform before the 2008 election and had to answer tough questions from @entity31 about why that did not occur			1
at a forum by the @entity47 - language @entity46 network , @entity3 was pressed to admit that he had fallen short and took responsibility for a lack of action			2
but the president also said he did n't promise he would accomplish everything he wanted right away			0
there also is some @entity10 disillusionment with the stalled @entity55 in @entity6			0
this proposed law would create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants			0
@entity3 did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the @entity63 as children , but it did not change current immigration law			2
the president has said he is ready to act			0
he told the @entity67 in an interview before the election that he believes he will achieve immigration reform next year			1
opinion : how progress is possible 3 ) there is a bipartisan starting point having bipartisan support for immigration reform will not ensure passage -- it did n't for president @entity78 in 2007 -- but without it , chances are even slimmer			1
just days after the election , a leading @entity81 and @entity5 announced that they hope to start debate this year			0
sen. @entity85 of @entity86 , the third - ranking @entity87 @entity81 , and @entity88 sen. @entity88 of @entity89 say they will officially restart immigration reform talks that crumbled two years ago			1
@entity85 told @entity99 's " @entity98 " that he and @entity88 have a plan designed to appeal to interests on all sides of the highly contentious issue , and he 's optimistic that it can get through a @entity6 hobbled by political gridlock in recent years			0
the plan includes four key elements : stronger border security , creation of forgery - resistant proof - of - citizenship documents , fairer legal immigration for desirable candidates , and a " tough love " path to citizenship for those already in the @entity63			0
opinion : both parties must lead 4 ) @entity5 want to win a larger share of the @entity10 vote the election results thrust the immigration issue back into the spotlight partly because @entity5 nominee @entity118 won only 27 % of the @entity10 vote compared to 71 % for @entity3			1
why @entity118 lost the @entity5 wants to reverse the trend of decreasing @entity10 support at the ballot box			0
already , @entity5 lawmakers , political commentators and thought leaders have adopted a more conciliatory tone when discussing immigration			1
@entity127 , the former commerce secretary who led @entity118 's outreach to @entity10 voters , told @entity0 's " @entity131 " the candidate " made some mistakes " during his campaign that ultimately led to a precipitous drop in @entity10 support			0
the @entity5 primary process forced @entity118 to move to the right on immigration , something that did n't sit well with many @entity10 voters			2
to avoid repeating the mistake , @entity5 may consider working on immigration reform			1
5 ) @entity4 do not want to diminish their share of latino vote the @entity4 benefited from latino votes but that support is not assured in the future , especially if the @entity5 move toward the center on immigration			2
the @entity3 administration is responsible for a record - setting number of deportations even as it has employed prosecutorial discretion to focus on high - priority cases			0
the democrats will have to work with @entity5 if they want to reform an immigration system both parties agree is broken			2
@entity158 : under @entity159 , @entity160			0

@entity3 promised but could n't deliver comprehensive reform
@entity31 *factored* *heavily* in @entity3 's re-election , giving them more political clout
in defeat , @entity5 may see immigration reform as politically *smart*
