-- i ca n't tell you how much sex has complicated my life -- my writing life , that is			2
when i 'm not being a university professor of @entity9 studies , i write historical romance novels as @entity11			1
my colleagues in the academy -- who may have read romance fiction in high school , but have n't stooped to read it since -- have an unfortunate predisposition to characterize my entire genre by referring to its books as " bodice - rippers			1
" i 'm not rejecting the term " bodice - ripper " out of hand			1
it refers to romance novels published in the 1980s , novels in which the hero , overcome by lusty passion , quite literally ripped the heroine 's blouse , the better to expose her bodacious breasts			1
his button - scattering fervor allowed the heroine to enjoy sexual pleasure , but without having to explicitly agree to sexual acts , a stance that feminist scholars since then have tied to 1980s mores about women 's erotic behavior			1
one thing we @entity44 tend to forget ( surprisingly , given our scholarly historical focus ) is that sex -- its practices , its customs and conventions , and prevailing attitudes toward it -- is a function of the historical , cultural and social conditions of a given time and place			1
what was considered fun to read in the 1980s is n't necessarily considered fun to read now , and thus the bodice - rippers of the ' 80s went the way of that decade 's aggressive shoulder pads and crumpled leg warmers			1
the @entity64 of the 21st century is no longer in the same place when it comes to desire , women and the need to wreak havoc on apparel : in keeping with the times , my heroines tend to do their own button - scattering			1
what i 'm saying is that although eroticism is culturally , geographically and historically specific , we writers of historical romance sexualize history without regard for the specific epoch in which we set a novel			1
no matter how historically accurate the details and language in our novels might be ( and mine , in case you 're wondering , are pretty accurate ) , we write sex from the point of view of our own contemporary attitudes and mores			1
sex would be hard to be historically precise about anyway : who really knows what sex was like in 1600 ? @entity98 ( popular @entity100 slang as early as 1770 ) surely involved the same acts -- but who can say with certainty what emotions were involved ? scholars are working on that			1
in mid-march i took myself off to an academic conference at the @entity108 entitled " @entity109 : a @entity110 in @entity111			0
" the conference pulled together scholars working in feminism , queer theory and gender studies , and asked them to think about when and where cultural meanings get ascribed to sexual acts or anatomical categories			0
if i 'm accused , in my fiction , of sexualizing history , this conference looked as if it was doing the opposite : historicizing sex			2
for my money , the best paper delivered at the conference was @entity130 ' " @entity129 : a study in style			0
" as @entity130 pointed out , @entity132 ( c. 1613 - 1649 ) was an odd bird : a male university poet who wrote rapturously of female patrons and saints , but also of a naked @entity137 in extremis			2
he wrote letters to fellow ( need i add , male ) poets with talk of " flaming kisses			0
" gender seems to have been a flexible concept to @entity129 ; his poetry rings changes , occasionally referring to female saints with masculine pronouns			0
apparently , @entity129 has often been dismissed by poetry scholars , viewed as un-english in his luxurious emotionalism , an " exotic @entity153 import , like pasta or castrati , " in @entity130 ' citation of @entity158 's assessment			2
@entity130 concludes that @entity129 is the " queerest " of @entity160 poets , pointing -- in a flurry of lit - crit terms of art -- to his " queer , ecstatic , transportive traversal of identity positions			2
" what fascinated me about this paper -- and others at the conference -- was its move toward talking freely about depictions and explorations of historical sex as always being predicated on the present			1
in other words , there is nothing to recover if we do n't bring ourselves to the task ; once we do , our " discoveries " are tied to the ' 80s , or the ' 90s , or the moment of writing			0
@entity130 says this rather wonderfully , concluding that he wants to think of @entity129 as an " early modern proto - gay man -- or a prototype of a certain kind of gay man -- one profoundly enmeshed in various male cultures and forms of male camaraderie , but who is also in love ... with his divas -- real divas , heavenly female figures the likes of @entity197 , @entity198 and the @entity199			2
" @entity130 ' revelation that he " wants to think of @entity129 " as a prototype of a modern gay man is important			0
i too want to find myself in the past			0
the difference between us is that @entity130 turns to @entity129 's poetry written for his " sweet friends , " and i turn to my computer and to my imagination			2
in both cases , when it comes to sex , our observations are circumscribed by our own predilections			0
so , for all my colleagues , friends and strangers who may be reading this piece , let me make it very clear			0
my novels are not bodice - rippers , because i am a creature of 2011			1
my heroes are prone to whipping out a " @entity225 letter " ( now called a condom )			0
my heroines apparently all saw an early modern version of " @entity229 , " and know where their responsibilities lie			0
what neither my heroes nor heroines do is shag			0
because i do n't know what that looked like .			0
