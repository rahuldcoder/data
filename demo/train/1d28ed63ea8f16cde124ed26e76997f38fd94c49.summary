-- a dizzying number of trackers are available for health and lifestyle			0
enthusiasts can now chart every calorie burned or consumed , have their genetics broken down and backdated for centuries , or follow their stress levels through a family holiday			0
but while our waking moments become ever more transparent , the one - third of our life spent asleep has remained off limits			0
throughout history , dreams have proved resistant to interrogation			1
it is not known why we sleep at all beyond a general need to recharge and avoid the negative consequences of not sleeping , while an explanation for the substance of dreams has proved even more elusive , still dominated by the theories of wish fulfillment espoused by @entity26 and @entity27			1
but now , digital innovations are picking up the challenge			1
the @entity31 app seeks to connect users with their dreams , and to make them sociable			1
its first function is as an alarm clock that wakes the user gradually over up to 30 minutes , easing them into consciousness so as to preserve more of the dream state , rather than shattering it abruptly			1
dream researchers estimate that 95 % of dreams vanish upon awakening			1
once the user touches their phone it begins recording and invites them to share the still - fresh memories of the night , prompting them with questions			1
the input is scanned for keywords and patterns so that the user can build a picture of their experiences over time			1
more ambitiously , their personal data is anonymized and sent with gender and geographic data to cloud servers in the hope of building a global dream database			1
in this social network people can compare and discuss their experiences , while trends can be identified and analyzed			1
" we want to know what the most popular dream is in @entity73 , or @entity74 , at a given time " , @entity31 founder and ceo @entity69 said			1
" you can see the dreams from each city organized by keywords and numbers "			1
currently on a very limited launch of around 1,000 users , the data gathered is already offering insights			1
" last week the most dreams were recorded in @entity86 and the most common subject was relationships			1
it makes sense that as we are social creatures , we are social in our dreams too			2
" @entity69 wants his creation to be " a whole other psychological layer " of quantified technology that people can use in conjunction with their daytime devices for a more complete picture			2
the science of dreams scientific rigor is being applied to the project through specialists in psychology , neurology , sleep and behaviorism from leading academic institutions such as @entity110 and @entity111 , who will analyze the data and contribute their findings			1
one study will assess environmental impact on dreams , whether through temperature or war			2
a similar project is being undertaken by professor @entity121 of the @entity122 , a sleep specialist and the @entity125 's only professor of the @entity126			0
but in his case the goal is to actively shape dreams			2
@entity121 's dream : @entity132 app monitors sleeping movement in order to identify the @entity136 stage , the state of deep sleep which is most fertile for dreams and signaled by the cessation of neurotransmitters that control activity such as seratonin , and paralysis of movement but for the eyes			1
it targets the last and longest of these stages with a range of sound input from " peaceful garden " to " zombie attack "			0
the professor employed double blind tests and received over a million submissions from users , and noted a significant impact			2
" it affected the emotional tone of the dream rather than content " , says @entity121			0
" pleasant nature sounds resulted in more pleasant dreams than jagged sounds			2
the more people used it the more effective it is			2
it 's hit and miss because we 're targeting @entity136 from movement , but after 20 soundscapes they get used to it , they are less likely to be worried or woken up			0
" there is a therapeutic function , as bad dreams can be an indicator mental health problems			2
" you can wake up in a better mood , but also people with depression tend to dream more , and more negatively than non-depressives , which could be counter-acted			2
" @entity185 pilots control trips @entity121 is candid about the limits of his method , but new wearable devices are making far grander claims			2
the @entity192 headband is one of several innovations to smash its crowd - funding goal with the promise of lucid dreams -- consciousness while asleep			1
aurora measures sleeping brain activity through @entity203 reading , and provides physical prompts to the user once they are in the suggestible @entity136 state			0
while the product is yet to be systematically tested on humans , lucid dreams are a proven phenomenon , with over 50 % of adults believed to have experienced one			0
efforts to teach people how to access such dreams have been successful , and even electronically induced in clinical trials			1
one of the earliest scientists to establish the existence of lucid dreaming , @entity219 , will soon launch his own wearable tool the @entity222 , based on decades of research data			0
the appetite for such innovations is huge , shown in the millions of dollars raised for them in crowdfunding , as well as the thriving online communities that use lucid dreams for anything from thrill - seeking experiment to self - analysis and meditation			1
" what 's happening now is a digital dream movement " , says @entity233 , author of ' @entity234 ' and board member of the @entity236 ( @entity236 )			0
" we can fulfill a lot of potential that has n't been realized as there is a lot more quantifiable data			0
" @entity233 sees vast potential in seeking to influence and participate in dreams , pointing to tests that show athletes can improve performance by practicing in their dreams , artists can improve their creativity , and everyone can gain insights			1
" people are becoming aware of how important sleep and dreams are for mood , cognitive performance , physical health , and we are beginning to see them enter the quantified self paradigm , " says @entity233			1
neuroimaging shows physical form of dreams physically identifying dream activity in the brain has seemed hopelessly ambitious but this too is now entering the realm of the possible			0
researchers from the @entity270 in @entity271 , @entity73 , have been able to interpret @entity203 waves into simple images with around 70 % accuracy after extensively monitoring the patterns in sleeping brains and learning to recognize them			0
" it is hard to identify the neural origin of dreaming , but at least we can now read out part of dream contents from activity patterns in the visual cortex , which is normally active when we see objects and scenes during wakefulness , " says lead researcher @entity278			0
currently the images are crude , black and white shapes , but @entity278 sees vast potential for improvement and application			0
" more aspects of dream contents , such as action , emotion , and narrative structure , will be decoded with more sophisticated experiments and analysis methods			0
" " the results may be relevant to learning , memory , or mood			0
if so , the interpretation may serve as a marker for cognitive capacity and mental health ... it will be helpful to study the effect of particular dream contents on subsequent waking experience			0
" the tantalizing prospect of laying bare our unconscious mind has never been closer			0
but the more we can shape and monitor our dreams , the main issue could become just how well we want to know ourselves			0
