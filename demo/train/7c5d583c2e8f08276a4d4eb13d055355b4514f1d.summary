the @entity4 raid : at a glance arriving earlier at one of the entrances to the @entity50 encampment , @entity10 said the scene resembled " a war zone			1

protesters were breaking bricks and gunfire could be heard , while tear gas was filling the air			0

a lot of people are emotional , we 've seen women cry , we 've seen people appear to lose consciousness because of the tear gas and now we just wait to see what happens			0
" this is going to be an incredibly difficult demonstration to clear out			0
not like ( the @entity85 ) that was cleared out earlier today by security forces -- this is a much larger sit - in			1
" as @entity10 spoke to @entity1 , he described protesters barricading the street where his television crew had arrived and where fighting had broken out			1
it was unclear whether the clash had involved security forces or residents opposed to the sit - in , he said			1
" that 's not unusual for residents who are against the @entity26 -- against the former president -- to get in on these fights			2
" the protesters appeared to be surrounded on all sides , he said			0
" this is the most intense gunfire that i 've personally heard during these clashes over the past six weeks			2
clearly some of it automatic weapons , some of it sounds like it 's coming from rooftops			0
" i have n't seen any weapons on this side -- i have n't seen any protesters firing weapons but they are breaking bricks , throwing rocks -- it 's not clear what they 're throwing at			0
but there 's a lot of chaos here			0
" two hours later , @entity10 said the outcome of the gunfight had been " incredibly bloody			2
" " over the hours we 've seen one body after another pass through to a makeshift clinic			0
" @entity4 explained : 6 key questions on the other side of the square , @entity128 said riot police had been firing tear gas " as groups of @entity60 demonstrators tried to break through police lines to join the encampment			1

" at least four ambulances passed through the police lines on their way toward the site of the sit - in			1
two members of the security forces could be seen being put into the ambulances			1
" @entity128 and her team later moved to another entrance to the square after experiencing some hostility			0

" other individuals in the crowd were helping us to pull back from that situation , " she said			0
@entity128 and her team later came under fire while she was reporting live on @entity1			1

one of those killed was @entity167 , a former @entity1 cameraman who had been working for @entity168 for the past 15 years			1
in the chaos of the raids , it has been impossible for @entity1 to verify the claims and counterclaims of protester casualties			2
