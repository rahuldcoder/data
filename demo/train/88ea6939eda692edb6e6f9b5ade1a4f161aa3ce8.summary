-- a federal judge on tuesday ordered the @entity3 military to stop enforcing the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , putting an end to the ban on openly gay troops			1
@entity3 district judge @entity9 ' permanent worldwide injunction -- praised by gay rights organizations -- orders the military " immediately to suspend and discontinue any investigation , or discharge , separation , or other proceeding , that may have been commenced " under the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
the judge , a @entity18 appointee based in the @entity19 of @entity20 , previously ruled that the policy regarding gays serving in the military violated service members ' fifth amendment rights to due process and freedom of speech , but had delayed issuing the injunction			1
the military was sued by @entity30 , a gay rights group			1
@entity32 spokeswoman @entity31 would say only that the department is " reviewing the ruling			2
" the department has 60 days to appeal , but is not required to do so			0
the @entity37 is reviewing the ruling to determine whether it has immediate impact and is consulting with the @entity32 , @entity37 spokeswoman @entity36 said			2
@entity41 lawyers in a recent case argued the military -- not the courts -- is in the best position to evaluate and enforce the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			2
president @entity47 is pushing for a repeal of the controversial policy			2
a bill currently before @entity51 would overturn the measure after a @entity37 review is completed in december			0
in her ruling tuesday , @entity54 stated the policy infringes on the rights of military personnel			1
" furthermore , there is no adequate remedy at law to prevent the continued violation of servicemembers ' rights or to compensate them for violation of their rights , " the judge wrote			1
more than 12,500 people have been booted from the military since " do n't ask , do n't tell " went into effect			0
along with barring known gay , lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving , the policy prevents the military from asking them about it			0
@entity30 praised the ruling but urged " caution by servicemembers considering coming out at this time , as the @entity47 administration still has the option to appeal			1
" the group said the ruling is a victory for strong national defense			1
" no longer will our military be compelled to discharge servicemembers with valuable skills and experience because of an archaic policy mandating irrational discrimination , " it said in a statement following the ruling			2
@entity97 , which describes itself as the nation 's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans , also hailed the judge 's ruling but urged gays who serve to be careful about coming out now			1
" this order from judge @entity54 is another historic and courageous step in the right direction , a step that @entity51 has been noticeably slow in taking , " said executive director @entity105			0
the ranking member of the @entity111 called on the administration to immediately file a motion to stay the injunction so @entity51 can address the issue			1
" we are a nation at war			0
this decision could have a negative impact on military and family readiness since the @entity37 is unprepared to address the issues that are bound to arise from such a hasty change , rep. @entity127 " @entity119 , @entity20 , said in a statement			0
@entity128 , director of the @entity129 , a research institute of the @entity131 , said he expects the @entity47 administration to appeal tuesday 's order			0
" the case could be done next week if the administration decides not to appeal , or it could take five years if there is an appeal , or @entity51 could move faster than the @entity32 , which would render this case moot , " said @entity128 , whose institute researches sexual minorities in the military and advocates an end to the ban			0
@entity0 's @entity143 and @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
