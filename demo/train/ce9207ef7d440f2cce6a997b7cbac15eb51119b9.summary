@entity0 -- @entity2 first arrived on the national political scene when , a few years after being elected to the @entity4 , he pushed ethics violations charges against then - speaker @entity6 , who later resigned			1
ethics complaints and a budget battle that forced a government shutdown , led to @entity11 's downfall after he had risen to the speaker 's chair			1
on thursday , @entity11 is expected to announce that he will explore a presidential run , typically the first step toward a national campaign			1
while @entity11 's quest to topple @entity6 helped him become the deputy leader of @entity20 in 1989 , what solidified his place in @entity24 political history was his championing of the @entity26 , a blueprint for changes the @entity29 pledged it would bring to @entity30 if it gained control of the @entity4			1
the contract required that all laws the public had to abide by also applied to @entity30 , limited the terms of committee chairmen and required a three - fifths majority vote to pass a tax increase			0
the contract helped propel the @entity29 to its first majority in the @entity4 in 40 years and got @entity11 , a representative from @entity40 , elected speaker			1
@entity11 coverage on the @entity42 " those of us who ended up in the majority stood on these steps and signed a contract ... aimed at restoring the faith and trust of the @entity24 people in their government , " @entity11 said as he was sworn in as speaker in january 1995			1
soon @entity11 was battling the @entity54 as congressional @entity29 pushed government cuts to help balance the budget			1
both sides dug in and there were two government shutdowns			0
@entity11 and congressional @entity29 came out the political losers			1
" it 's very difficult to work with a president who seems to be primarily driven by his political advisers to engage in public relations stunts , " @entity11 said of @entity61 in early november 1995 , a few weeks before the first shutdown			1
@entity67 ridiculed @entity11 for allowing hurt feelings over a perceived slight by @entity61 to influence his stance in the budget negotiations			1
@entity11 said he had felt snubbed by @entity61 and his staff when he traveled with the president to @entity74 for @entity76 's funeral			1
@entity11 had to use @entity78 's back stairs for the trip			1
he said @entity61 's behavior had caused him to toughen his stand during initial budget discussions			2
the incident was later immortalized by a @entity86 cartoon titled " @entity87			0
" in a @entity89 op - ed last weekend , @entity11 dismissed suggestions the shutdowns were that bad for his party			1
" those who claim that the shutdown was politically disastrous for @entity20 ignore the fact that our @entity4 seat losses in 1996 were in the single digits , " @entity11 wrote			1
" moreover , it was the first time in 68 years that @entity29 were re-elected to a @entity4 majority and the first time that had ever happened with a @entity105 winning the presidency			0
" in 1998 , @entity11 lashed out at the @entity54 's handling of the aftermath of the @entity110 affair , calling it a " systematic , deliberate , obstruction of justice			1
" later it was revealed that @entity11 was having an extramarital affair with a congressional staffer			2
@entity11 had to confront numerous ethics complaints brought by @entity67			1
he voluntarily turned in a $ 4.5 million book advance after critics questioned its appropriateness			0
in 1997 he agreed to pay $ 300,000 to the @entity4 to reimburse the cost of an ethics investigation into whether he used tax - exempt funds to promote @entity29 causes			0
he was not found guilty of those charges			0
he was reprimanded by the @entity4 for giving what was considered misleading information			0
republicans kept control of the @entity4 for a third consecutive term in the 1998 elections , but won fewer seats than expected			0
@entity11 resigned as speaker and left @entity30 the next year			2
over the next decade , @entity11 mounted a comeback , expounding on the lecture circuit on his numerous ideas about how to reform government and society -- ranging from creating a new social security system based on what one contributes to completely revamping the country 's energy policy to replacing the @entity145 with a new @entity146			1
he also formed a successful think tank , called @entity149 , which he used to help develop and communicate his ideas			0
his visibility was elevated when he joined @entity152 as a contributor , which gave him a national platform to comment on the news and promote a number of books he has written on subjects ranging from the @entity24 political scene to @entity161			0
@entity152 announced on wednesday that it was suspending the contracts of @entity11 and a fellow contributor , @entity29 former @entity165 sen. @entity164 , until they make decisions about running for president			2
@entity11 is also a prolific fundraiser			2
@entity149 raised more than $ 3.8 million between october and the end of december 2010 and almost $ 14 million over the entire year			0
the @entity149 political action committee raised an additional $ 425,000 from october through december			0
with those numbers , @entity11 outpaced his potential 2012 rivals in money brought in			2
@entity29 consultants not affiliated with any prospective campaign said they believe @entity11 as a presidential candidate offers positives as well as negatives			2
" he is an idea factory			0
@entity29 voters love him , " @entity29 consultant @entity181 said			0
" they have watched him on tv and watched his think tank produce on an almost weekly basis			0
" the cons are that he has a political record			0
he has been a career politician in @entity0 and a @entity4 speaker who left under controversial circumstances and that could weigh on voters ' minds			2
" some @entity29 consultants also said his personal life , with two divorces , will complicate any potential run because that will not be popular with some social conservatives who are a key voting bloc in key early voting states .			0
