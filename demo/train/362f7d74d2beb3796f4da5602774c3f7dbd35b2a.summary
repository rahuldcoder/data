@entity1 just over a month after the release of @entity5 aid worker @entity4 from a @entity7 prison ushered in a new era between @entity1 and @entity9 , the relationship is facing a new chill			2
speaking at a summit of @entity5 and @entity14 leaders wednesday , @entity7 president @entity11 made some big demands of the @entity16			1
among them , @entity11 asked for the return of the @entity19 to @entity7 , an end to the five decades - old trade embargo , a ceasing of @entity16 - run television and radio broadcasts on the island , and compensation for economic damages			1
" the economic , commercial and financial blockade that provokes enormous human and economic damage is a violation of international law that ought to be overturned , " @entity11 said			0
the @entity35 thursday dismissed @entity11 's demands			2
when asked whether the @entity16 would actually return the @entity19 base to @entity7 , press secretary @entity37 responded with an abrupt " no. " " the naval base is not something that we believe should be closed , " he said , adding that the @entity16 would keep the base even after the prison has been emptied			1
the comments were somewhat of a reality check for an administration attempting to navigate a relationship weighed down by decades of mistrust			0
it may take more time than originally expected			0
" what ( @entity11 's ) comments highlight is that there is a pretty clear difference between reestablishing diplomatic relations and carrying out the longer process of normalizing relations , " @entity37 said			0
but as the @entity58 's @entity57 notes , @entity11 's audience has to be taken into consideration			0
" this is a speech that @entity11 was giving in front of the @entity62 to several of his regional friends , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , people who may feel challenged by @entity7 and the @entity16 reengaging their relationship , " @entity57 said			1
he added : " the @entity7 government has long benefited from a position of confrontation with the @entity16 , and as president @entity79 's policies take away a lot of those excuses , i think we 'll see the @entity11 government come up and rehash some of these talking points to be able to continue to feed that ever - diminishing credibility of that argument			1
" so as @entity11 feeds the beast , do n't expect the @entity16 to give in to @entity7 's demands			2
" we should n't be derailed by the fact that we 're dealing with a difficult totalitarian government and if we allow the @entity7 government to determine what steps we do or do not take , we 're in essence putting our foreign policy in the hands of a totalitarian state , " @entity57 said .			0
