@entity1 , @entity0 -- it was inevitable that a tragedy on the scale of @entity6 , when 96 @entity8 fans were crushed to death during an @entity11 semifinal with @entity12 , would have a transformative effect on @entity15 football			1
a @entity8 supporter wednesday , outside @entity17			0
ninety - six fans died from the 1989 @entity6 disaster			2
but there was little reason to believe 20 years ago that , rather than being pushed even further towards the margins of society , the sport was on the brink of a revolution that would give birth to a global sporting phenomenon			1
even before @entity6 , it had seemed as if there was something irredeemably rotten at the heart of @entity15 football			1
@entity33 , a scourge synonymous with the @entity15 game , had receded from its peak in the 1970s but @entity15 clubs were outlawed from @entity39 competition after rampaging @entity8 fans caused a wall to collapse at @entity43 ' @entity42 before the @entity45 final , causing the deaths of 39 people , mostly supporters of the @entity50 side @entity49			2
@entity52 prime minister @entity51 , showing little understanding or patience for the traditions of the sport , had virtually ghettoized fans , promoting a scheme to have each supporter issued with an identity card			0
on the field , sides such as @entity8 , @entity62 and @entity12 were renowned for their attractive play but elsewhere a corrosive cult of long ball football pervaded the game			0
that trend seemed to find vindication when arch - exponents @entity70 , who in the course of a decade had bullied and scrapped their way through four divisions to reach the top flight , defeated @entity8 in the 1988 fa cup final , prompting match commentator @entity78 to declare that " the @entity79 have beaten the @entity80			2
" with its clubs banned from @entity39 , many top @entity52 players opted to leave @entity0 altogether -- @entity84 and @entity85 to @entity86 , @entity87 to @entity88 , @entity89 to @entity90 -- adding further to the sense of terminal malaise			2
@entity6 had not been caused by hooliganism but the tragedy was a product of the environment that hooliganism had created ; stadiums resembling decrepit fortresses , the fans caged inside steel bars and heavy - handed policing which treated all supporters equally -- as potential troublemakers			1
coupled with @entity106 and a fire at @entity108 in 1985 in which 56 fans died , it also served to reinforce the belief that going to a football match was something which could put your life in danger			0
in " the last game : @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 , " a book examining the lasting impact of the events of 1989 on the sport , author @entity118 describes @entity6 as @entity15 football 's " psychological moment , the point of no return			1
" " the culture of the game had to change definitely if football was ever to be perceived as anything more than the preserve of the white , working class male , a theatre of hate and of violence , often racist and misogynistic excesses , if it was to survive at all , " says @entity118			0
@entity15 football not only survived but within a few years had reinvented itself , in the elite " @entity144 " division of the country 's top clubs at least , as an internationally recognized super brand capable of attracting the world 's best players and broadcast around the planet			1
the engine for this transformation , in the wake of @entity6 , was the @entity152 , an inquiry into the causes of the disaster which called for the steel fences inside grounds to be dismantled and for the phasing out of the traditional terraces of standing fans with all - seater stadiums			1
initially clubs received government funding to help them meet the costs but the sport was about to receive an injection of cash that would radically change its financial prospects			0
despite its poor reputation , there remained a huge appetite for televised football -- ironically , itself a by - product of the fact that many supporters were no longer going to matches			2
realizing this , the country 's top clubs broke away from the game 's traditional power structure , setting up the @entity144 and selling tv rights for Â£ 191 million ( $ 286 million ) to media tycoon @entity184 's newly established satellite television venture , @entity185			1
the money was a shot in the arm for football , while @entity185 's coverage regenerated interest in the sport by repackaging it as something shiny , exotic and exciting			2
on a @entity39 - wide scale , the replacement of the old knockout format @entity45 with the @entity197 achieved something similar , creating a clique of continential superpowers			0
the television rights boom also convinced many in the sport that football could actually be profitable			0
some clubs raised more cash by floating on stock markets and others , such as @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 , invested in shiny flying saucer - like new stadiums			0
but the success of the @entity144 also owed something to events on the pitch			0
if @entity6 marked a nadir for @entity15 football , the @entity219 in @entity50 -- and @entity221 's tears during the national side 's epic semifinal defeat by @entity224 -- offered a moment of catharsis that rekindled many casual fan 's residual love for the game			1
subtle changes to the rules implemented worldwide by @entity234 , including banning back passes to goalkeepers , automatic sendings off for professional fouls and changing the offside rule to give the benefit of the doubt to forward players , gradually made the game a more attractive spectacle			0
meanwhile , the emergence of @entity248 's young and exciting @entity247 team as the @entity144 's dominant force , perfectly captured the spirit of the new age yet grounded the game in the traditions of the past			2
finally , the 1995 @entity254 , which granted players across @entity39 freedom of movement when out of contract , and the end of restrictions on the number of foreign players teams could field , created an international transfer market which lifted the horizons of the @entity15 game and brought genuine world class stars including @entity267 and @entity268 , and eventually @entity269 and @entity270 , to the @entity144			1
still , for many football fans , the glamour and wealth of the @entity144 , with its homogenized stadiums and corporate entertainment suites -- in which clubs are bought and sold by global plutocrats from @entity277 to @entity278 via @entity279 and @entity280 -- represents a betrayal of the sport 's traditional values			1
" there 's still a powerful nostalgia among fans of my generation for a lost , less aggressively commercial era of football , when the game seemed less cynically concerned with exploiting the loyalty of those who pay to watch and with selling itself to a global audience , " says @entity118			0
yet in a week when four @entity144 sides featured in the quarterfinals of the @entity197 and public appetite for the game appears insatiable , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that @entity15 football is in a better state than anyone who witnessed the horror at @entity6 20 years ago could ever have dared believe			1
more importantly , it is virtually inconceivable to imagine the circumstances in which 96 fans died ever being repeated in an @entity15 stadium .			0

@entity15 football has been transformed in 20 years since @entity6 tragedy
disaster created *impetus* for all - seater grounds , *improvements* in *infrastructure*
top clubs also benefited from creation of @entity144 and sale of tv rights
the @entity144 is now the world 's most watched sporting league
