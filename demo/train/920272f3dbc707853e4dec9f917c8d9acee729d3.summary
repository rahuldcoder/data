fears of a possibly nuclear - armed @entity1 took center stage early in thursday night 's vice presidential debate between incumbent @entity5 @entity4 and his @entity7 challenger , @entity6			1
" when @entity9 was elected , they had enough fissile material , nuclear material , to make one bomb			2
now they have enough to make five , " @entity6 said			0
" they 're racing toward a nuclear weapon			0
they 're four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability			0
" the @entity20 congressman said @entity1 's progress has sped along " because this administration has no credibility on this issue			0
" @entity4 hit back by criticizing what he called " bluster " and " loose talk " about the issue , saying international sanctions are crippling the @entity1 economy and that @entity32 and @entity33 officials believe @entity1 is " a good way away " from getting the bomb			1
fact check : what about security in @entity39 ? the facts : @entity1 has greatly expanded its ability to produce nuclear fuel in the past four years , revealing a second uranium enrichment plant in 2009 and continuing to defy @entity45 demands that it halt work until questions about its intentions are resolved			1
a bit of tech talk here : about three - quarters of 1 % of naturally occurring uranium is uranium - 235 , the radioactive isotope used to produce a nuclear reaction			0
to produce fuel for nuclear power plants , that concentration has to be increased to 3 to 5 % , while research reactors use fuel with a u- 235 concentration of about 20 %			0
to make a nuclear weapon , that concentration has to be increased to more than 90 %			0
as of may , @entity1 had produced about 6,200 kilograms ( 13,640 pounds ) of power plant - grade uranium and 146 kilograms ( 320 pounds ) of fuel at 20 % concentration , according to the @entity68 , the @entity45 nuclear watchdog			1
based on those figures , the @entity72 - based @entity71 , estimated that @entity1 could produce enough weapons - grade uranium for five nuclear bombs			1
the organization , led by former @entity45 weapons inspector @entity76 , says @entity1 could build a crude bomb with 20 - 25 kg ( 44 - 55 pounds ) of highly enriched uranium			1
however , it would take @entity1 more than two months to produce that amount if it started with 20 % - grade uranium , and " several months " to make enough for a bomb using low - enriched uranium			2
that would give the world community enough time to detect the operation and organize a response , @entity71 noted in june			0
and there 's more to building a bomb than just having the uranium , as @entity4 noted			2
@entity71 estimated last week , that @entity1 would need " many additional months " to develop a device that could be tested " and even longer to make a reliable warhead for a ballistic missile			0
" fact check : wind power , electric cars and the stimulus @entity1 has denied conducting any nuclear weapons research , insisting its nuclear program is for civilian purposes			2
the @entity68 has verified that @entity1 has not diverted any of its declared uranium stock , but cautions that @entity1 " is not providing the necessary cooperation " to verify that all nuclear work is peaceful			1
@entity33 has accused @entity1 of working toward a nuclear weapon , raising concerns that it could launch a preventive attack on @entity1 nuclear facilities			2
@entity33 is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , but has never disclosed whether it has the bomb -- and @entity1 has accused @entity33 and the @entity32 of trying to sabotage its nuclear facilities			1
as for the @entity32 , @entity32 intelligence agencies believe @entity1 " is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons " but has not made the decision to build a bomb , director of national intelligence @entity115 told a @entity118 committee in january			1
conclusion : according to at least one widely circulated estimate , @entity1 could produce enough uranium for five bombs , as @entity6 says			1
but the same estimate notes that it would draw attention if it did so , and that 's only part of the work necessary to make a weapon			0
