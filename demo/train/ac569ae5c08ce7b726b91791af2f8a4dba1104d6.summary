-- in the middle of the @entity4 wilderness , a man on horseback had a brief conversation with two campers			1
the rider 's realization later that he may have been talking to @entity11 @entity10 suspect @entity9 and his alleged teenage captive has now focused a nationwide manhunt for the pair on the rugged mountain area in central @entity4			1
the horseback rider saw the man and girl wednesday and struck up a brief conversation with them , @entity21 , spokeswoman for the @entity23 , said friday			1
he was not aware of the manhunt at the time , but he called the @entity10 tip line after he saw a news account that night and realized the pair matched the description of @entity9 and 16 - year - old @entity9 , she said			1
the rider 's impression of the pair was " it seemed odd but nothing as alarming , " @entity21 said			2
" they did speak and exchange pleasantries			0
i do n't think there was a lot of information exchanged , " she said			0
" he left the conversation believing they were camping in the area			0
" the rider said the man and girl were on foot , hiking with camping gear , @entity21 said			2
@entity21 appeared to be correcting authorities ' earlier reports that the suspect and girl were spotted by more than one horseback rider			1
investigators set up checkpoints where @entity9 and @entity9 were believed to be traveling in the @entity55 , about 15 miles outside @entity56 , @entity21 said			1
authorities have n't yet evacuated any homes or businesses , she said , adding , " we have those access points secured			2
" the horseback rider 's tip moved the national manhunt for @entity9 and @entity9 , who was last seen saturday afternoon at her cheerleading practice , to the @entity4 mountains			1
authorities in @entity11 began looking for @entity9 after their mother was found dead inside @entity9 's burned - out house in the @entity71 area sunday			1
late friday , authorities said lab tests confirmed that a second body found in the house was that of @entity9 's 8 - year - old brother , @entity75			1
@entity9 was a close friend of the @entity77 family , and father @entity77 has appealed to @entity9 to let his daughter go			1
friday morning , investigators found @entity9 's car hidden by brush , its license plates removed , about six to eight miles from where the rider spotted the girl , authorities said			1
they confirmed the car 's ownership by its vehicle identification number , he said			0
the vehicle will be examined by bomb and arson technicians to ensure it 's not rigged with explosives , @entity90 added			0
his office has said evidence found at the burned house indicates that explosives may be in the car			2
the horseback rider said the man and girl appeared to be in good health , @entity90 said			1
suspect ' capable of anything ' authorities deem @entity9 a dangerous suspect because he is accused of killing @entity9 's mother , @entity108 , and possibly @entity75 as well			1
the second body is so badly burned that carrying out a @entity111 test is proving difficult , authorities said			0
the sheriff 's office is treating @entity75 as a missing person until they can identify the body			0
a search of @entity9 's burned - down house led law enforcement to this conclusion : " we do n't hold anything past this person , " as one official put it			1
" we think that he 's capable of anything at this point , " said capt. @entity123 of the @entity71 sheriff 's office			0
based on what the sheriff 's investigators have seen , there is evidence that the fire and kidnapping of @entity9 was a " very well - planned event , " @entity123 said			1
@entity4 on friday became the latest state to issue an @entity10 for @entity9 , following @entity11 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138			1
why more @entity10 alerts will be waking you up the @entity71 sheriff 's department already said it was possible @entity9 was hunkered down in a rural area because he is a camper			2
" we 've got law enforcement agencies across the country looking for them and following up on tips that are being called in , " @entity146 lt. @entity145 told @entity0 on thursday			0
" we 've received numerous tips , i 'd say probably well over 100 , possibly hundreds of tips from across the country			0
every tip that can be followed up on has been followed up on or is currently being followed up on			0
" suspect is family friend @entity9 was described as being so close to the @entity155 that he was considered part of the family , @entity77 told @entity0 's @entity158 on thursday			1
he came into their lives before @entity9 was born			2
@entity9 was such good friends with the family that @entity77 said he ca n't reconcile the man he knows with the crimes he is suspected of			1
" i have been through every scenario in my brain , " @entity77 said			0
" there was nothing ever to show any indication of this			0
" @entity9 joined the family on campouts and was always friendly toward them , he said			2
" i ca n't fathom what happened in @entity175 's head			0
he obviously just lost it , " @entity77 said			0
" you 've taken everything , " the father pleaded to @entity9 in the interview			2
" the damage is done			0
just let my daughter go , let her go home safe , let her be with me and try to mend things from there			0
" some witnesses have told investigators that @entity9 had a crush on @entity9 , but @entity77 has said the family had no knowledge of that			2
@entity123 said that they are looking into whether the suspect possibly had an " undue infatuation " with the teen			0
