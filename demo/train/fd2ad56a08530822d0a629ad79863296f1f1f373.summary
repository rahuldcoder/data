-- check - in applications for your smartphone are all the rage ; even @entity5 has gotten into the game with its new " places " feature			1
but not all location - based apps are created equal -- or even with the same goal in mind			2
@entity13 , a location - based platform that allows you to turn your shopping into charity			1
made possible in part by @entity20 , which funded 14 business plans out of the thousands it received , the company that created @entity13 has capitalized on the check - in craze to turn marketing dollars into charitable donations -- donations that reached an impressive milestone			1
@entity0 talked with @entity28 , the co-founder and ceo of @entity31 , which created @entity13			1
the following is a transcript that has been edited for length and clarity			2
@entity36 : it is the first app that lets you do good deeds simply for checking into a store			1
every time you check in , you earn what we call @entity43			1
these karmas turn into real money contributions to charities			1
there are 30 different charities on @entity13			1
the 30 charities range from feeding a family in @entity52 , behind that is the @entity55 charity ; or helping to fight cancer , that 's @entity58 's @entity57 organization ; or helping an earthquake victim in @entity60 that goes through the @entity62 ; all the way to feeding a chimp in @entity65 , or if you 're more on the green side of things , you can plant a tree in a rainforest with @entity70			1
so there 's a whole range of different causes on the application			2
the simple way to earn these karmas is to check in to stores and restaurants as you go about your shopping day			1
@entity0 : how does the check - in process work ? @entity36 : so you open the app , and by @entity82 , it pulls a list of stores that are closest to you , and then you can click on them , tap on them and check in , and you earn like five karmas , 10 karmas			1
then you can go to the " @entity89 " and select the cause you are most passionate about , and then your karmas turn into actual money contributions to one of these charities that you selected			1
and the coolest part is , you do n't have to pay for this			2
the money comes from big brands like @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , who have together provided more than a million dollars in marketing money that consumers turn into charity donations			1
that 's kind of the interesting piece from a business perspective			2
this money would have never gone into charity			0
this is marketing money ; this is not philanthropy money			1
the reason the big brands provided the money was because they reach consumers in a really passionate moment			1
if you were the chief marketing officer of a big corporation , would you rather put your money into billboards or into feeding a family in @entity52 or helping an earthquake victim and at the same time reaching consumers in really positive special moment when they make that contribution ? @entity0 : how did @entity13 originate ? @entity36 : @entity13 is the result of us wanting to get into the market of mobile location - based shopping applications			1
we were trying to figure out the answer to a simple question : are consumers really interested in doing something besides texting and talking on their cell phones while they are out shopping ? we were working on our flagship product [ @entity31 ] in the background , but what we wanted to do was make sure we put something in front of consumers really quickly and understand what they like to do			0
and we thought of the notion of @entity13 as the perfect way to do that			1
@entity0 : how did you come up with the idea ? @entity36 : we came up with it by saying : how can we give meaning to the check - in ? because honestly , what does the check - in mean today ? there are only so many places i want to let my friends know where i am			1
the question is not what happens at the check - in , but what happens after the check - in ? what is the check - in standing for ? we 're saying : what if you could actually change the world by going shopping ? that 's @entity13			1
the result was that @entity13 became the fastest - growing location - based retail application in the entire app store			1
550,000 downloads in five months			0
and 40,000 consumer ratings -- people love this app. we have donated close to a million dollars			0
( shortly after the interview @entity31 notified @entity0 that it had reached the million dollar milestone			0
) @entity0 : who decides where the money goes ? @entity36 : you decide it			0
big brands provide the money ; consumers decide where the money goes			1
the money can go anywhere			0
@entity0 : what do the brands get out of this ? @entity36 : the brands get multiple things			2
first , they reach the consumer in a really passionate moment , because the consumer does something they care deeply about			0
you 're planting a tree , for example , or you 're feeding a family -- and then it says on your phone , " made possible by @entity102 " or " made possible by @entity210			0
" and then you can let your friends know about it , and it goes all the way into the @entity5 feed , and the average number of friends on @entity5 per person is 130			0
now , do the math ; that leads to a @entity228 rate [ the cost to show the ad to 1,000 viewers ] of less than $ 6			0
if you do advertising on a billboard or a magazine you pay $ 10 to $ 50 @entity228 , and you have not fed a family , you have just paid for a billboard			0
@entity0 : what are the brands ' reactions to this ? @entity36 : they like it so much , they have doubled down			2
@entity100 has already put more money into the whole operation			0
@entity102 is excited about it			0
@entity0 : what is @entity31 ? @entity36 : @entity31 is basically the selfish version of @entity13			1
the points go to yourself , they 're called kickbucks , and you can spend them on anything you want			2
you can donate them to charity if you like , or you can rack them up for yourself			2
@entity0 : so what are some of the achievements that @entity13 has reached ? @entity36 : we 've provided clean water for 80,000 people for a month in @entity259			1
41 million liters of clean water in developing countries for children			0
offset 5 million pounds of carbon			0
315,000 meals to people in the @entity266 plant 88,000 trees			0
donated 36,000 books to children			0
provided 42,000 pounds of food to hungry chimps			0
rescued 190 animals that were victims of animal cruelty			0
provided netbooks to a sixth - grade classroom in @entity277 , a second - grade class in @entity279 and one in @entity281			0
the @entity62 has received more than $ 100,000 for @entity60			0
so this is actually serious impact			0
it was just a trial -- we thought we 'd just have a few thousand users -- turns out more than half a million in just a few months			2
it 's just amazing really , because the check - in actually means something			2
as long we get donation money , we will keep donating .			0

with the @entity13 app , users check in at stores and get points
then they use the points to donate to charities
