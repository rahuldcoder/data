-- a new feature from @entity2 will let you e-mail just about anyone with a @entity6 account , and , in turn , give them the ability to e-mail you			1
the feature , announced on the official @entity12 blog , wo n't give your actual e-mail address to strangers			1
but when a @entity12 user begins typing in the address box , it will provide suggestions including people in their @entity6 network			2
the idea , @entity2 says , is to make it easier to contact friends and other contacts when you 've forgotten , or never had , their e-mail address			1
but some early reactions suggested the new change may make it too easy			0
another reason to hate @entity6 , " wrote @entity30 , a reporter for tech blog @entity31 , on @entity33			2
" they turned it into a stalking tool			0
" others , like @entity39 of @entity40 , said it looks like another attempt to push users to @entity6 , which , as a social network , has never presented a real challenge to @entity46 , though @entity2 has continued to integrate it into other , more popular , products like @entity48 and , now , @entity12			1
" what ( ceo @entity50 ) page and @entity2 seem maddeningly unaware of is that nobody can ever be forced into having a party , " @entity39 wrote			0
" that in fact , the forcing is what makes a party impossible			0
" @entity2 , clearly anticipating the privacy concerns , notes that users may limit the feature , or opt out of it entirely			1
while the default g + setting will allow anyone on @entity6 to contact you , users may limit that access to people in their circles on the network , or to nobody at all			2
there are other limits , too			0
a user may only e-mail you using the system once if you do n't reply ( addressing the stalking concerns , perhaps )			0
and messages from people who are not in your @entity78 will go into the " @entity80 " folder , along with other posts from sites like g + , @entity46 and @entity33 , instead of the user 's primary inbox			0
@entity2 said the feature will be rolling out to @entity12 and @entity6 users over the next couple of days , when they will receive a message with a link to the feature .			1

new feature means all @entity6 users can e-mail each other
people would n't need to know your e-mail address to send you e-mails
@entity2 says feature makes it easier to reach friends
some worry it strips privacy
