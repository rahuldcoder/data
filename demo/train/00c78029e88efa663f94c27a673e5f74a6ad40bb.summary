the second set was more one - sided , @entity6 making his only gain against service after the protest			2
clearly impatient to close out his victory , @entity1 immediately broke at the start of the third , but in trying to press made mistakes to be broken back			2
he broke through again to take a 5 - 3 lead and duly served out comfortably for victory , falling back on to the clay in trademark fashion to celebrate after a whipped forehand winner on championship point			1
