@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 3:30 a.m. , @entity3 awoke to a feeling of uneasiness			2
something was not quite right with her daughter , @entity7			2
creeping into her bedroom , @entity3 removed a lancet from its wrapper and poked her diabetic daughter 's finger			2
putting the blood onto the testing strip , she saw the results : dangerously low blood sugar			2
@entity3 woke @entity7 up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness			2
@entity3 was relieved her motherly intuition had told her something was wrong with @entity7 that night , but she wished she did n't have to rely on it			2
she yearned for an automatic way of knowing when @entity7 was dipping into a dangerously high or low blood sugar -- and not just at night , but at school , where the 12 - year - old is largely responsible for monitoring her own blood sugar			2
then last week , @entity3 got her wish			2
@entity7 was selected to try out an experimental device called an artificial or " bionic " pancreas			1
during the three - day study , @entity7 did n't have to poke her finger every few hours to find out her blood sugar level because the " bionic " pancreas recorded it automatically and adjusted her insulin accordingly			1
@entity3 did n't have to set her alarm to wake up every three hours at night because the device was designed to catch a dangerously high or low blood sugar and treat it			1
" for the first time since she was diagnosed , i did n't have to worry , " says @entity3 , who lives in @entity0 , @entity1			2
medical device companies are racing to be the first to market an artificial pancreas , which takes over the work of the diabetic 's malfunctioning organ			1
the device could potentially be used for @entity47 diabetics or type 2 diabetics who use insulin			1
" it 's transformative technology , " says @entity50 , assistant vice president for treatment therapies research at @entity51 , a research foundation for juvenile diabetes			1
@entity51 is funding artificial pancreas trials at 13 sites worldwide , including @entity57 , @entity58 , the @entity59 and the @entity60			1
device companies also are funding several other studies			1
" it 's looking incredibly promising , " @entity50 says			2
" i hope very much we 'll have a system on the market within four years , and i 'll be very disappointed if we do n't			2
" ' pale and pasty ... and all by herself ' it was @entity7 who urged her mother to enroll her in an artificial pancreas study			1
the @entity74 first heard about the artificial pancreas shortly after @entity7 was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8 , but she had to be 12 years old to enroll			1
so the day she turned 12 this past september , she started bugging her parents			0
" she was constantly reminding me , ' @entity80 , you need to call , you need to call , ' " @entity3 remembers			0
her mother was only too happy to comply			0
there had been several middle - of - the - night close calls , plus some desperate situations at school where the staff nurse was responsible for 450 children and " ill - equipped , " @entity3 says , to handle the needs of a diabetic child			0
" i got a call from @entity7 one morning			0
she was in the school office and her voice was trembling , and she said ' @entity80 , i need you to come quick			0
i do n't know what 's wrong , ' " @entity3 says			0
" i got there and her blood sugar was dropping like a rock			0
she was pale and pasty and sweating profusely and all by herself			0
" a glimpse of the dream in january , @entity7 walked into @entity101 to start the trial			0
doctors fitted her for an artificial pancreas			1
in the future , the device will be the size of a cell phone , but for now @entity7 is hooked up to a laptop			1
for three days , the device did the work @entity7 's pancreas can no longer do			1
" it went very smoothly -- her blood sugar control was really very , very good , " said dr. @entity113 , an instructor at @entity114			0
" we were really very pleased by what we saw with @entity7			0
" @entity113 's research partner , @entity120 , an associate professor of biomedical engineering at @entity121 , says the device learned @entity7 's blood sugar patterns and made changes accordingly			1
" it 's making adjustments every five minutes , " he says			0
for that one weekend , @entity7 did n't have to draw blood , and she could eat foods she had n't eaten in large quantities for four years			0
" she ate @entity131 's and grilled cheese and french fries and hamburgers , " @entity3 says			0
" she ate between 67 and 100 grams of carbs [ every meal ] , and usually she can only eat between 40 and 50			0
" then , after the experiment , @entity7 had to leave the artificial pancreas behind , and it was back to counting carbs and poking herself every couple of hours			1
her mother reset the nighttime alarm clock			0
" we 're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device , " @entity3 says			1
" i think it will revolutionize the way she lives			0
" " that was really hard , " @entity7 says			0
" i just hope one day i can use it at home			0
" baby steps last week , @entity113 and @entity154 visited the @entity156 offices in @entity157 , @entity158 , to show regulators a prototype for the artificial pancreas			1
the device itself can be worn in a pocket or clipped to a belt			1
two tiny pieces go under the skin , one to detect glucose levels in the blood and another to deliver insulin and glucagon , a drug used to raise very low blood sugar			1
algorithms determine how much insulin and @entity176 the patient needs , and if necessary the patient can manually override the device			1
so far , the @entity156 has required doctors to keep patients inside the hospital while their using the device			1
the potential benefits are enormous , dr. @entity184 , who chairs the @entity156 's @entity185 , testified before a @entity188 committee last year			0
but " if not properly designed , use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk			1
" @entity113 said he hopes that by the fall , the @entity156 will give him permission to allow adult diabetic patients to leave the building and walk the grounds of the @entity101 campus accompanied by a nurse , eating as they like and using the hospital 's gym			0
then by the summer of 2013 , he hopes to give the artificial pancreas to children attending a summer camp			1
" these are all baby steps towards what we ultimately want to do , which is give them the device and say , ' go home and check back with us in a week , ' " @entity113 says			1
@entity3 is closely watching the proceedings at the @entity156 , with the help of her mother , sen. @entity213 , @entity214 , who co-chairs the @entity215			0
" we 're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device , " she says			2
" i think it will revolutionize the way she lives			0
