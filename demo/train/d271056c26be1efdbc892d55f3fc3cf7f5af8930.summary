-- @entity1 looks like an old - school football manager			1
renowned for his infamous " hairdryer " blasts at under - performing players , he has the well - worn visage you associate with huge stress levels and his admitted love for red wine			2
but the 69 - year - old is much more than his gruff , often intimidating public persona , according to a man who has seen the @entity15 transform @entity17 's fortunes in the past quarter of a century			1
" he was far deeper than that , more intelligent , more widely read , and he had a very clear idea of the modern game , the modern player and what the modern player needed to do , " @entity1 's former adversary at @entity23 , @entity24 , told @entity0			1
@entity1 is a tough post-match assignment for any television interviewer and has become adept at using the media in his battles with contemporaries such as @entity33 and @entity34			2
@entity1 's top 25 @entity17 moments " he 's nothing like the person you see after the game , or interviewed			1
the only thing that 's true about him in those situations is his sincerity and his desire to make sure that he gets his point of view across , " said @entity24 , who in 1992 was the last @entity40 manager to win the domestic league title			1
" he 's become one of the best			2
sometimes he has n't got the credit for it , where sometimes other people have			0
i think his use of the media has yet to be bettered			0
" @entity1 arrived at @entity17 in 1986 , flush from his incredible success at @entity57 football club @entity56 , and he was disappointed by what he found			1
has @entity1 tinkered too much this season ? appointed to replace @entity60 on november 6 , he inherited a squad of big - name internationals , a notorious drinking culture -- and the high expectations of a major club that had not won a league title in 19 years			1
he , on the other hand , had taken @entity56 to three @entity57 titles , five domestic cups and -- most impressive of all -- a @entity71 final triumph against the mighty @entity72 in 1983			0
" he came into a @entity17 which , he 's said many times , surprised him -- it was a disappointing surprise , " @entity24 said			1
" he told me a couple of weeks after he 'd been there ... he got the players together on a monday morning , and the summary of his conversation was , ' listen , fellas , you 're going to have to change , because i am not going to change			0
' " what he inherited , he saw the potential but perhaps at that point had n't realized how much he was going to have to do			0
in the early years it was difficult , but fortunately -- thanks to @entity87 and one or two others at the club -- people had patience			2
" not only patience but also they had foresight			0
they realized they had a jewel in their hands			0
" that patience has paid off , as @entity1 has transformed @entity17 ahead of his 25th anniversary at the club this weekend			1
he can look proudly back upon 12 @entity102 titles -- last season 's was an @entity40 - record 19th for @entity17 -- plus two @entity104 crowns , five @entity105 , four @entity106 and a @entity71			1
but , if he had been employed in these cut - throat days , @entity1 may not have lasted past his first five years in charge			1
it was widely speculated that he would be sacked if @entity17 lost to @entity110 in an @entity112 tie in the 1989 - 90 season , but his team won that match and went on to clinch his first silverware at the club after a replayed final against @entity119			1
@entity24 , however , believes @entity1 's turning point came at that fateful team meeting years earlier , and everything else flowed from there			1
" he walked out of that gym , and it was the beginning			0
clearly , he did n't win all the battles , but he won the war , " said @entity24 , now chairman of the @entity127			2
he credits @entity1 , a former union steward in the @entity131 shipyards , as one of the first in the line of modern managers who believe in high physical standards and a scientific approach			2
" there was a drinking culture at a few clubs , and he and i shared many common values , and we both recognized that if you want to get the best out of your body as an athlete , then you could n't keep abusing it , " @entity24 said			2
" changing culture at a place and changing behavior is the mark of a great leader			0
he 's been there 25 years , and he 's changed it permanently			1
that 's what leadership 's about			0
" @entity1 has a well - known love of racehorses -- he sued former @entity17 shareholder @entity160 over stud rights of a horse in 2003 -- but @entity24 said his charity work is not so widely appreciated			1
" he does go to great lengths to help those not as lucky as he is , " @entity24 said			2
" he travels here , there and everywhere for charities			0
... he 's got his own charitable trust			0
" i know that he is very good with young people who are starting out			0
he reads their letters and gives them far more consideration than others , because he recognizes the need to give youngsters that help			0
" after winning the first staging of the new @entity102 format in 1993 to end @entity17 's long wait for the title , @entity1 famously introduced a new generation of young players at @entity17 , including @entity185 and @entity186 ; the latter he persuaded not to sign for rivals @entity188 as a teenager , and he is still at the club			1
he had also invested wisely in signing @entity191 from @entity23 and midfield warrior @entity192 from @entity110 , both of whom had a major influence in @entity17 's new glory years			1
@entity192 believes @entity1 's hunger to succeed is what has kept him at the @entity17 helm for so long , despite an aborted announcement that he intended to retire at the end of the 2001 - 02 season			1
it 's as simple as that , " the @entity204 told @entity0			0
" in football some players get a new contract , teams win a trophy , and you never hear from them again because they 're made up			0
" at @entity17 , for the players and supporters , it 's all about the next game			2
@entity17 , over the past 20 - 25 years ... we never relaxed			1
we never thought we were done			0
it was let 's win the next game , the next trophy			0
" that 's why i think the manager has been so successful			2
... he 's constantly looking at the bigger picture			0
" @entity1 's continued success has come under threat this season from @entity17 's big - spending local rivals @entity188 , including a humiliating 6 - 1 home defeat this month			1
but @entity24 believes @entity1 will bounce back from what he called his worst moment in football			1
" he 'll come back even more determined , if that 's possible , than he ever was			0
for him to come out and say that publicly ... that will have cut him to the quick			0
" @entity1 's reign will not last forever , and @entity24 believes @entity17 must prepare for a reversal in fortunes when he finally steps down			1
" you wo n't be able to replace him			0
he is , in my opinion , the greatest manager that 's ever been , and to think you can go out and pick someone who 'll sit behind his desk and just pick up the reins as if nothing has changed -- that 's very difficult , " @entity24 said			2
" whoever follows him will need to be the right person , but more importantly the people at the club will need to be patient , because that person is walking into perhaps the most solid culture in a business that there is anywhere in the world			0

former adversary @entity24 says @entity1 is nothing like his public persona
