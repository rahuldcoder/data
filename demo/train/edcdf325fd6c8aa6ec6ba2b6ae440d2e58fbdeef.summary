the devastating attack on the @entity1 in @entity2 , @entity3 , on friday was almost certainly the work of @entity5 , which has stepped up its bombing campaign across northern @entity3 in recent weeks			1
it may seem counterintuitive that @entity9 militants should attack a mosque , but since its early days , @entity5 has targeted the @entity12 " establishment " in @entity3 , accusing it of not defending the interests of @entity3 's 80 million @entity12 , of corruption and of " perverting " @entity14			1
one eminent member of that establishment is the emir of @entity2 , @entity19 , a former governor of @entity3 's @entity21 who frequently preaches at the @entity2 mosque on fridays			1
the emir of @entity2 is the second-most influential @entity12 figure in @entity3			1
@entity19 was reportedly out of the country at the time of friday 's attack -- but two weeks ago , he used friday prayers to urge @entity3 to defend themselves against @entity5			1
" people must stand resolute " against a group that enslaves girls and " must not assume that the crisis will not reach their area , " @entity19 said			0
the @entity2 attack , which killed dozens of worshipers and injured scores more , is not the first aimed at a mosque or at an emir			1
last year , at least 40 worshippers were shot dead at a mosque in @entity41 , where @entity5 is strongest			2
the group has also assassinated senior @entity12 political and religious figures in northern @entity3			1
and it has specifically targeted anyone calling for or organizing self - defense units , known as the @entity47			0
@entity19 's predecessor , emir @entity48 , was the target of an assassination attempt in february 2013			0
his driver and bodyguards were killed			0
@entity48 died this year , at the age of 83			0
@entity5 has stepped up suicide bombings , causing mass casualties in several northern states			1
just this week , two female suicide bombers attacked a busy market in the city of @entity60 , killing 21 people			0
and the bombing of a bus station near @entity64 in @entity66 state killed 40 people			0
@entity5 claimed to have taken control of @entity64 , a town of 200,000 people , at the end of october -- a sign of its commitment to build an area in northern @entity3 ruled by @entity14 law -- in addition to carrying out terror attacks			1
the @entity3 army , supported by civilian vigilantes , was able to expel @entity5 from @entity64 two weeks later , but the group still controls several towns across northeastern @entity3 , including @entity82 , a town of nearly 300,000 in @entity41			1
according to @entity5 's mysterious leader , @entity84 , @entity82 was evidence of the group 's growing ambitions in northern @entity3			1
" thanks be to @entity89 , who gave victory to our brethren in @entity82 and made it a state among @entity14 states , " he said in august			2
@entity96 , research fellow for security and development at the @entity99 , said the @entity3 military faces multiple problems			2
it has been plagued by indiscipline , desertion and mutinies , with some commanders attacked by their own men			0
it has developed a well - documented reputation for human rights abuses , alienating many of the people it is meant to protect			0
additionally , a lack of support has left many units exposed in the vast rural hinterland of the north , where @entity5 has shown it can operate simultaneously on several fronts			2
last week , for example , its fighters ambushed and killed nearly 50 fish - sellers close to @entity124 , nearly 400 miles from @entity2 , despite the nearby presence of a multinational border force			2
a state of emergency in parts of northern @entity3 has had little impact on @entity5 , and despite intense international attention , the @entity3 military has been unable to rescue any of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped this year			1
the group 's resumption of a campaign of suicide bombings is probably aimed at humiliating the government of president @entity137 , who recently declared he would run for re-election in february			1
besides its ideological aversion to democracy , which it sees as inimical to @entity14 , @entity5 despises @entity137 as a southern @entity141 and wants to make the north ungovernable			1
@entity96 says one of its aims is to ensure that february 's election can not be held in the three northern states where emergencies have been declared			0
attacking @entity2 , the biggest city in the north and a trade hub , is part of that strategy			0
( the state of @entity2 is one of the two most populous in @entity3			1
) in an effort to win more international support , @entity3 officials have likened @entity5 to the @entity157 in @entity158 and @entity159			2
@entity3 's ambassador in @entity161 , @entity162 , said this month , " there is no use giving us the type of support that enables us to deliver light jabs to the terrorists when what we need to give them is the killer punch			2
" dismissing claims that the army was responsible for human rights abuses as rumor and hearsay , @entity172 said the @entity178 needed to do more to help a partner in the battle against terrorism			0
" we find it difficult to understand how and why , in spite of the @entity178 presence in @entity3 with their sophisticated military technology , @entity5 should be expanding and becoming more deadly , '' he told an audience at the @entity183			2
despite providing technical assistance in the hunt for the missing schoolgirls , the @entity190 administration appears wary of engagement with a military that has such a flawed reputation			0
there is evidence that @entity5 has links with other jihadist groups			0
some of its fighters spent time in @entity202 alongside a faction of @entity204 in early 2012 , when much of that country fell under that group 's sway for several months			2
its rapid assimilation of bomb - making expertise and the use of kidnapping for ransom also suggests contacts with @entity204 , says @entity96			0
but she believes that as @entity204 has come under pressure following the @entity216 intervention in @entity202 , it has become less able to provide training or other help to @entity5			0
for now , @entity5 remains a very much @entity3 phenomenon focused on causing mayhem at home			1
and it is the civilians -- in their many thousands -- who bear the brunt of its attacks .			0

since its early days @entity5 has targeted the @entity12 " establishment " in @entity3
the group accuses the " establishment " of corruption and " perverting " @entity14
@entity5 has stepped up suicide bombings , causing mass casualties
friday 's attack at a mosque in @entity2 killed dozens , injured scores more
