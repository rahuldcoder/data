-- tuesday 's @entity2 earthquake triggered the shutdown of a nearby nuclear power plant and spurred declarations of " unusual events " at plants as far away as @entity8 , @entity10 authorities reported			1
@entity11 said both reactors at its @entity14 plant , less than 20 miles from the epicenter of the magnitude - 5.8 quake , shut down automatically after the first tremors			1
@entity18 , an emergency management spokeswoman for @entity19 , said the plant vented steam , but there was no release of radioactive material			0
@entity25 , the utility 's chief nuclear officer , said the 1,800 - megawatt plant was operating on emergency power and the two pressurized - water reactors were safely deactivated			2
" the plants are designed for this kind of a seismic event , " @entity25 said			0
" there is no apparent damage to anything at the plant right now			2
" crews were working to restore off - site power to the plant tuesday evening , the utility said			0
@entity41 , senior vice president of nuclear operations for @entity11 , said some power from the grid had been restored to the reactors and it was possible full power could be achieved late tuesday			2
it was not clear if a 4.2 - magnitude aftershock tuesday evening would affect the operation			0
@entity41 said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool			1
the diesel generators supplying backup power have enough fuel to operate 30 days and more can be brought in , if needed , @entity41 told @entity0 " the power plant is safe , " @entity41 said			1
one of those generators failed a few minutes after it kicked in , said @entity59 , a spokesman for the @entity61 's regional office in @entity62			1
but only one generator is required to supply power to each reactor unit , leaving another unit in reserve , @entity59 said			0
" they 're in good shape at this point , " he said			0
@entity41 said even with the failure of one generator , @entity11 has four others in use or available			0
the @entity14 plant is about 50 miles northwest of @entity75 and about 90 miles southwest of @entity76			1
operators declared an alert -- the second - lowest level of emergency reporting under @entity10 nuclear regulations -- after the quake struck shortly before 2 p.m. , the @entity61 said			1
@entity61 inspectors went over the @entity14 plant as part of a review of @entity10 nuclear facilities after the disaster at @entity89 's @entity88 , where three reactors melted down following the massive earthquake and tsunami that struck the plant march 11			1
they found that diesel generators needed to provide emergency power were functional and " readily available for short - term actions , " and the utility moved quickly to replace one portable generator that was not working at the time , according to the @entity61 's inspection report			1
at @entity88 , the worst nuclear accident since @entity102 , cooling systems and backup generators were knocked out by the 15 - meter ( 48 - foot ) tsunami that swamped the plant shortly after the magnitude - 9 earthquake			1
@entity108 said reactors at its other nuclear station , the @entity112 plant near @entity113 , were still running			0
@entity112 and 11 plants in five other states issued an " unusual event " declaration , the lowest level of emergency notice , according to the @entity61			2
they are the @entity122 plant in @entity123 ; the @entity125 plant in @entity126 ; @entity129 's @entity128 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 plants ; the @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity136 plants in @entity137 ; and the @entity139 and @entity140 plants in @entity8			0
" all these plants continue to operate while plant personnel examine their sites , " the @entity61 said			2
@entity0 's @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0

new : some *electricity* restored to nuclear power plant
inspection shows no damage to spent fuel pool
one of four backup generators failed at the @entity14 plant , the @entity61 says
one nuclear plant shuts down ; 11 others declare " unusual events " after quake
