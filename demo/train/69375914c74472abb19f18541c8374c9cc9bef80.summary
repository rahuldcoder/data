@entity0 -- federal officials said thursday more needs to be done to warn rescuers of special dangers at the scene of small plane crashes			0
although firefighters are well versed about the dangers of burning fuel and sharp debris , they may not be aware that some aviation systems -- systems considered safety devices aloft -- become especially hazardous on the ground			0
among the hazards : ejection seat rockets , airbag components , and explosive charges that deploy parachutes that can lower the entire aircraft to the ground			2
" these explosive components , if they remain charged and are unknown to first responders and investigators , pose a high level of risk to those working in and around the aircraft wreckage , " the @entity22 said			1
the safety board cited five incidents since 2001 in which first responders and accident investigators who responded to plane wrecks were evidently unaware of the hazard of explosive components			1
" in some cases , they began performing rescue , fire suppression and accident investigation activities that might have inadvertently activated the explosive component , posing a great risk of injury , " the safety board said			0
none resulted in fatalities or injuries to the responders			0
in one incident -- the january 2012 fatal crash of an experimental jet near @entity53 , @entity54 -- a police officer became aware of the hidden dangers only after an @entity22 investigator told him by phone not to allow the recovery of the pilot 's remains until the pilot 's ejection seat could be deactivated			2
in another incident , firefighters attempting to put out a blaze at a @entity68 crash took additional safety precautions after being told the plane had a @entity72 -- a solid - fuel rocket used to deploy the plane 's parachute			0
the @entity22 is recommending that the @entity76 take additional steps to address the safety issue			1
the @entity76 should require aircraft owners to disclose the presence of explosive safety devices when they register their aircraft every three years			1
the online registry is easily available to first responders , the @entity22 said			1
the @entity76 also should issue a safety bulletin to first responders , the board recommended			1
the @entity76 said it will review the recommendations			0
" we have collaborated with ballistic device manufacturers , airplane manufacturers , firefighting organizations and other first responder groups to develop training about the potential hazards at an accident scene and to ensure that warning markings meet the necessary guidelines , " the @entity76 said in a statement .			2
