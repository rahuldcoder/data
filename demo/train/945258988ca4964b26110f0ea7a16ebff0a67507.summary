-- a filmmaker with multiple sclerosis hopes an app he developed will help fellow wheelchair users make cities like @entity6 more accessible			1
for most people , meeting friends for dinner at a new restaurant , jumping into a taxi or going out for a shopping trip should n't require too much advanced planning			2
just show up and walk in			0
but as @entity17 discovered , these simple actions that he took for granted for the first 25 years of his life harbored hidden obstacles that made them nearly impossible to perform in a wheelchair			1
steps , narrow doorways , cracked sidewalks and impossibly long ramps were only some of the barriers he encountered as he tried to navigate @entity6 , where he lives , from a chair			1
most of the subway system is out of reach , since not all stations have elevators			0
and not all taxis are equipped to load wheelchairs either			0
frustrated by his inability to move around as freely as he liked , @entity17 developed @entity36 â € ” a crowdsourcing platform that allows people around the world to rate businesses for accessibility and , most important , to share that information			1
because while the @entity43 , enacted by @entity44 in 1990 , mandated that buildings and other facilities become more accessible to those with disabilities , @entity17 found huge variability in how well the law was executed			1
@entity0 : the myth of @entity53 's wheelchair beyond that , many buildings constructed before 1990 are exempt from the regulations			0
@entity36 is n't intended to rate the extent to which a structure is @entity43 - compliant ; it simply serves as a tool for people with mobility issues to find out which businesses in their community are actually accessible , and to what degree			1
launched in 2012 as a website and mobile web app , @entity36 is powered by @entity68			1
both of the current iterations allow the user to rate several features of local businesses for accessibility , which are tallied into an overall star rating			1
much like @entity79 and other crowdsourcing platforms , the more data that users contribute , the more useful the app will become			2
also like @entity79 , with more ratings , the most positive or negative reviews are canceled out so users end up with a solid core of realistic reviews			0
" i think it 's critically important that people like @entity17 are getting involved and creating change in their own right			1
it is the only way that this effort will be successful , " says @entity91 , president and ceo of the @entity93			0
" you see a lot of innovation by people with disabilities ... but the number of people who are participating and changing the future , changing their own future by changing society , is far too few			2
" @entity0 : disabled kids get in the game instead of leaving the ratings for @entity36 up to specialists , @entity17 wanted members of the disabled community to inform and empower themselves , with the help of friends , family and neighbors , by pooling their evaluations of how accessible facilities really are			1
" i found that there was a lack of awareness in general around accessibility , " he says			2
" people without disabilities do n't realize all the challenges that we face , like is a restroom accessible , is there one small step outside a restaurant that would keep us from being able to get in ? it kind of blows their minds when they start to realize all these little details			2
opening up the ratings to the community is an attempt to bridge the gap between people living with mobility issues and the larger communities that we live in			2
" failure to adhere to @entity43 regulations can result in government injunctions , steep civil penalties and lawsuits			0
but while thorough , the law is complex and often difficult to apply in practice , resulting in the patchwork level of accessibility that @entity17 encountered			1
initially , the @entity150 offered free written advice to business owners who had questions about applying the law , but those letters ended in the mid- ' 90s			0
since then , businesses rely on @entity43 consultants or lawyers , whose help can be costly , or free ada - consulting services , which can be difficult to find			1
building inspectors are tasked with making sure that state and local codes are followed , and states can request federal certification from the @entity150 that these codes adhere to or exceed the requirements of @entity43			0
but as @entity17 and others affected by disabilities have found , there can be variation in the extent to which these codes actually address accessibility			1
for example , the degree of steepness and length of a ramp can render it too challenging for someone in a manual wheelchair ; a fraction of an inch on a door frame can make it too narrow for some chairs			1
@entity0 : equipping the disabled and when it comes to older structures , which are more common in cities in like @entity6 , for example , the issues become even more challenging			0
" those facilities have an obligation to remove barriers to the extent that the removal is readily achievable , and that is a multifactor analysis that takes into account the cost of the removal , the difficulty , the resources of the business and a host of other factors , " says @entity192 , a partner at the legal firm @entity193 and leader of its @entity195			0
additionally , as with any piece of legislation , enforcement is also a major issue			0
for @entity17 , the app is his legacy for the disabled community			1
a documentary filmmaker in @entity6 , he was diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis , a rare , accelerated form of the neurological disorder , after he noticed that his walk began to change in 2005			0
with @entity36 , he hopes to help others like him to live as independently as they can			1
@entity17 and his wife @entity222 , whom he met while developing the product , have started hosting mapping days across the @entity225 , bringing together volunteers from the community to map entire neighborhoods in @entity36			1
and at the same time , they are raising awareness around accessibility			0
" the work i do , this app and the film , is about changing the face of disability			0
the civil rights movement , the gay and lesbian movement , even the feminist movement all gained traction			0
but for some reason , the disability movement kind of slowed down , " says @entity17			2
" i 'm trying to find a way to bring it back			0
" @entity17 's documentary film , " when i walk , " opens theatrically in @entity6 at @entity246 on october 25 and in @entity247 on november 1			2
