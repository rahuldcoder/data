on his sixth birthday , at the height of @entity2 , @entity0 received a congratulatory postcard from his father with a rather unusual wish inscribed on it : " may you grow up to be a soldier in the fight for liberation , " read the card			1
" looking back , it was a little bit heavy , " remarks @entity12 , now aged 78			0
but as burdensome as his father 's message might have been , it instilled the young @entity17 with a strong conviction about the value of justice , a belief @entity12 has fervently advocated and fought for throughout his life			1
@entity0 became one of @entity17 's most eminent political activists and judges , famous for being amongst the leading legal minds behind the creation of the country 's groundbreaking constitution after the first democratic elections in 1994			1
" getting the constitution , when everybody predicted a bloody racial war , was a triumph in itself , " says @entity12 proudly			2
" and we did it ourselves ; it was n't forced on us -- we looked into each other 's eyes , people who 'd been trying to kill each other			2
" and @entity0 , one of the most prominent white @entity17 freedom fighters , knew all too well about the cruelty of years gone by			1
as a young lawyer defending victims of apartheid 's repressive laws , he often faced the wrath of security police and was put in solitary confinement for nearly six months without trial			2
read this : apartheid photographer ' sick of taking pictures of dead ' in april 1988 , while living in exile in @entity56 , @entity12 lost his right arm and the sight in one eye to a car bomb			1
after a long and painful recovery , he returned to @entity17 , a country he had last seen 24 years earlier			1
shortly thereafter , @entity64 was released after more than 27 years in prison , and work began on the birth of a new @entity17 , ending the horrors of the old regime and creating a new rule of law			1
@entity0 was appointed to serve as one of 11 judges in the newly established @entity73 , where he helped write one of the most world 's most progressive constitutions in 1996			1
" how can we live together in one country ? what can the basic rules be , the basic values that respect the dignity of everybody ? " says @entity0 as he explains the thinking behind the constitution			1
" whoever you are , whoever your parents or grandparents happened to be , wherever you came from , whether you are exalted , whether you are humble , you 're a person , you 're a human being , " he says			0
" the constitution does n't build houses , the constitution does n't provide food , electricity , water , school text books , but it provides a framework in which people can claim these things , resolve their disputes and that 's what we lacked before in @entity17			1
so if it had n't been for the constitution , it would 've been just total chaos , and most opportunistic grabs from power			2
" as someone who 'd paid a big physical and psychological price for his fight for freedom , @entity0 says the establishment of a just rule of law served to help a deeply wounded population put its troubled past behind it			1
" it was n't simply a healing of a fragmented , fractured , divided nation filled with enmities and fears and arrogance , " he says			0
" it was a healing for me , personally , " he adds			0
" the healing comes about through the achievement of the ideals for which we were fighting			0
" read this : why mixed - race comic was ' born a crime ' but @entity0 was not only one of the architects behind @entity17 's post-apartheid constitution ; he also helped design the @entity73 in @entity132 , an impressive building created to visually represent the ideas expressed so clearly in the country 's new rule of law			1
" we decided we wanted a building -- a brand new court , a brand new constitution , " says @entity0			1
" not one parachuted in from outer space , one that grew up from our history			0
" as a result , the @entity73 was chosen to be constructed right next to @entity132 's @entity145 , a notorious building whose walls had served to confine two of the best know civil rights figures of the previous century			2
" we say with a dubious pride , we @entity17 have the only prison in the world where both @entity64 and [ @entity154 ] @entity153 were locked up -- nobody else can make that claim , " says @entity0			1
" and we wanted to show the transformation from negativity to positivity , why we have a constitution , " he adds			2
" moving forward without forgetting the past and taking the terrible energy of hatred , division , pain of the past and using that force of that energy to create something positive and hopeful for the future			0
" a passionate art collector , @entity12 has also donated several of his fine pieces to the @entity73			0
he is immensely proud of the building , where he spent five of the 15 years he was a @entity174 , and never tires of visiting it			0
now retired , @entity0 lives in @entity177 , @entity178 , with his family -- wife @entity181 and young son @entity180 , aged six			1
@entity0 says he would never be able to give @entity180 the same burden his father placed on him when he was six			2
he even admits he ca n't speak to @entity180 about the horrors of apartheid			0
" i do n't want to , " he sighs			0
" he 'll find out			0
i can tell him that there were cruel people , put a bomb in my car , blew me up , wonderful doctor saved my life			2
i can tell him all that , that he can understand			0
" i do n't want to tell him that his mommy and his daddy , they would n't have been allowed to live together , to love , and to conceive him			0
i do n't want to			0
it 's like putting a burden on him , that we had to shoulder and deal with , and in a sense what we were fighting for was to be free of that lived reality and even the memory -- i 'm happy to move on			0
