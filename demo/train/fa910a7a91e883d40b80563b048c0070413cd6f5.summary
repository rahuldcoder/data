-- the hike to the bottom of the @entity3 -- and out again -- was symbolic for @entity4			1
it was a sign of how far she had come , a sign that the middle - aged mom of two was active , adventurous and alive			2
she had lost 80 pounds over the last year and a half through regular exercise and a healthy diet			1
she was in the best shape of her life , and the trip to @entity17 's natural wonder was a chance to celebrate			2
it was a grueling hike , about 15 miles down and up the steep trail with hundreds of switchbacks			2
but on that day in summer 2011 , @entity4 had no idea her biggest battle was yet to come			1
a healthy habit four years ago , the 5 - foot - @entity25 weighed close to 250 pounds			1
" when i turned 40 , i looked down at the scale and thought , ' oh my , i must really do something about this , ' " the @entity27 , @entity28 , woman says			2
family wins $ 10,000 after losing 255 pounds a friend convinced her to join a local @entity35 , and the pair started attending group fitness classes			1
@entity4 liked spinning , which allowed her to burn calories without pounding her joints with the extra weight she was carrying			1
step aerobics was another story -- " i 'm jigging when everyone was jogging " -- but being able to laugh at her lack of coordination kept @entity4 coming back			1
after a while going to the gym became just another habit , like brushing her teeth			2
" i used to be very emotionally vested in hating the gym , " she says			2
" you 're not emotional about brushing your teeth			0
it 's something i do because i want to have teeth when i 'm old			0
i want to be able to move when i 'm old			0
" the first 50 pounds seemed to fall off @entity4			1
after eight months , she joined @entity60 to overhaul her diet			1
in the past she had tried everything from hypnosis to prepackaged meals to restriction diets to lose weight			0
but eating better was n't such a big deal after conquering the gym			0
" i 'm the kind of person where i can change one habit ... at a time , " she says			0
" i found that trying to master everything at once was just too much			0
" foods that will power up your spring diet @entity4 hit the gym five to six days a week and traded cookies for apples and bananas on her kitchen counter			1
within a year she had lost another 30 pounds			1
the aches and pains that had come with her extra weight and advancing age stopped			0
she felt confident and more at ease			0
she looked forward to living a longer , happier life			0
maintaining normalcy in december 2011 , @entity4 had an elective hysterectomy			1
during surgery , her doctor uncovered a tumor in her uterine muscle and removed it for testing			0
the tumor was leiomyosarcoma , a rare cancer that 's often only discovered in the terminal stage			1
@entity4 's cancer was stage i. she started the first of four rounds of chemotherapy in february 2012			1
through it all , she continued to hit the gym and make healthy food choices			1
at the gym , her goal was simply to keep moving			0
and if ice cream was all her stomach could handle , she chose frozen yogurt			0
" so much of what 's happening to you is out of your control , " she says			0
" i wanted to control what i could			0
" overall health during cancer therapy is critical , says @entity4 's oncologist , dr. @entity119			1
" we encourage ( patients ) to eat healthful meals , exercise and continue in activities they enjoy			1
" let 's talk about sex ... and cancer exercise helped @entity4 sleep better at night and work through some of the drugs ' side effects , such as constipation and nausea			1
she went to the gym the morning of her chemo treatments to relieve stress			0
" it helped me mentally -- kept me strong , kept me balanced			1
" patients should stay involved in life , @entity140 says , to avoid obsessing about their cancer diagnosis			1
" given the supportive medicines we have , most patients are able to maintain normalcy			0
" @entity4 's weight loss may have done more than prepare her mentally for the challenge ahead			1
obesity has been linked to cancer incidence rates			2
and research has shown that cancer patients who are overweight have a higher risk of mortality than patients with a normal body mass index , @entity140 says			2
twice in a lifetime @entity4 is now in remission and has kept the weight off for more than three years			1
she still has about 10 pounds to lose to reach her goal weight , but she 's says she 's not in any hurry			2
" it think it 's all about being patient and ... making the best choices every day , " she says			0
" do i make great choices every day ? no. but you 've got to be forgiving with yourself and wake up the next morning and say , ' today , i 'm going to do better			0
' " her healthy lifestyle has increased her energy and opened her eyes to new opportunities			2
she plans to run a half marathon at the end of april with a bunch of her girlfriends from the gym , and hopes eventually to tackle the @entity3 again			0
" hopefully it 's not once in a lifetime , " she says of her first symbolic hike			0
