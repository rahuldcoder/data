-- the climate change crisis is upon us			1
the world 's leading climate scientists agree that time is rapidly running out and that urgent steps are needed in the next 10 years to dramatically reduce our carbon emissions			1
but exchanging global warming for nuclear meltdown is not the answer			1
from a purely practical standpoint â € ” and ignoring for a moment nuclear power 's other showstoppers such as cost , unmanaged nuclear waste , atomic weapons proliferation and catastrophic accident â € ” there simply is n't time to choose nuclear power			1
there are faster , affordable alternatives , including energy efficiency and renewable energy installations such as wind farms and solar arrays that can be completed in months to a few years			2
the average construction time for a new nuclear power reactor is close to 10 years			1
a 2003 @entity29 study concluded that more than two new reactors would have to start operating somewhere in the world every month over the next 50 years to displace a significant amount of carbon - emitting fossil - fuel generation			0
such a fantasy does not pass the reality check in corporate boardrooms or on @entity37 where nuclear power has been soundly rejected			1
the exorbitant costs and unpredictably long completion time -- a reactor at @entity43 in @entity44 , for example , was " under construction " for 23 years and may be connected to the grid by 2015 -- make nuclear power an unappealing , even reckless , business choice for corporations and shareholders			1
construction costs for a new reactor are predicted to top at least $ 15 billion , assuming the project remains on budget , which those under way in @entity57 and @entity58 have demonstrably failed to do			0
meanwhile , since 2008 , the world market cost of solar photovoltaic modules has fallen by 80 %			0
in the @entity65 , the four reactors currently under already - behind - schedule construction in @entity63 and @entity64 would never have begun without fleecing ratepayers in advance through a surcharge on their electricity bills			0
this cost is shouldered by ratepayers even if the reactor they are paying for is never completed			0
government support does not sweeten the pill			0
@entity75 abandoned its application for a new reactor in @entity78 after being offered a federal loan of just under $ 8 billion , a burden that would likely have been shouldered at least in part by taxpayers			0
@entity75 pulled out because it was unwilling to risk $ 880 million of its own money in federal financing charges			0
advocates of allegedly " new " designs such as the sodium - cooled integral fast reactor ( @entity90 ) touted in " @entity91 " are reaching back into the atomic dark ages			0
previous incarnations of this design have suffered fires , leaks and disastrous economics			0
for example , @entity98 in @entity99 , cost $ 10.11 billion and generated just one hour of electricity before closing			0
the " new " ifr design is decades away , economically unappealing , proliferation risky , and its safety claims are unproven			2
the ifr can not magically eat nuclear waste for lunch as some claim			2
theoretically , it can gradually reduce the amount of the more dangerous isotopes in the waste , but the process comes at very high costs with marginal benefits and would take hundreds of years			0
energy efficiency measures and renewable energy , which have been marginalized by decades of disproportionate federal handouts to the nuclear sector , are the real answer			2
they can be deployed fast , far more cheaply and safely , are more practical in rural , developing countries , and are more effective in displacing carbon than nuclear power			1
@entity124 has stepped in where the @entity65 failed to lead , well on the way to a 100 % renewable energy economy by 2050 , with a revitalized supply chain and 380,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector compared with 30,000 in nuclear			2
@entity132 , meanwhile , must import electricity in winter and during summer droughts and heat waves			1
the ongoing nuclear crisis in @entity99 in the aftermath of the triple reactor meltdowns at the @entity140 nuclear complex serves as a permanent reminder of the unacceptable risks posed by the current fleet of nuclear plants			1
given the latency period between exposure even to " low " doses of radiation and the manifestation of disease , we may not know the true health effects of the @entity140 nuclear disaster for decades			2
the experience of the 1986 @entity156 reactor accident demonstrates that negative health effects can last generations , cause immense suffering and trigger other fatal and non-fatal illnesses as well as birth defects			0
even the routine radioactive releases from nuclear power plants can prove fatal			1
studies in @entity124 and @entity57 found elevated rates of leukemia among children living near nuclear power plants			1
the situation at @entity140 remains perilous and could still become orders of magnitude worse			0
a technology that has the capacity to poison human resources and render vast areas unfit for habitation for decades , even centuries , can not be endorsed by environmentalists and runs contrary to the best interests of humanity			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 and @entity183 .			1

authors : there is n't time to choose nuclear power as a way to stop climate change
@entity37 rejects nuclear power plants for being costly and time consuming , say authors
beyond @entity132 's @entity182 and @entity183 say advanced nuclear technology is risky
