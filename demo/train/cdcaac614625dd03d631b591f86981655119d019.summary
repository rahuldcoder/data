-- @entity3 - @entity2 businessman @entity1 has set off a political firestorm in @entity3 with his claims that he was brokering an offer from @entity3 's civilian leaders to the @entity8 to unseat the leadership of the @entity3 military			1
those accusations forced the resignation on tuesday of @entity3 's ambassador to the @entity2 , @entity13 , who @entity1 says orchestrated this proposal , which was delivered in a unsigned memo in may to adm. @entity17 , then - @entity2 chairman of the @entity18			1
@entity3 is a nuclear - armed state that is home to a number of @entity22 groups that attack @entity2 and @entity24 troops in @entity25 and also is home to what remains of @entity29 's " core " organization			1
@entity13 helped smooth over many tense moments in the important @entity2 - @entity3 relationship , including the shooting in january of two @entity3 by @entity35 contractor @entity34 and the @entity37 raid that killed @entity38 in @entity39 in northern @entity3 in may			1
@entity1 has said that the offer to get rid of the leadership of the @entity42 was sanctioned by @entity3 president @entity43			1
the story is an explosive one in @entity3 , where relations between the civilian government and the military leadership are often tense and the @entity2 is deeply unpopular			1
writing in the @entity48 on october 10 , @entity1 explained that , " the embarrassment of @entity38 being found on @entity3 soil had humiliated mr. @entity43 's weak civilian government to such an extent that the president feared a military takeover was imminent			1
he needed an @entity2 fist on his army chief 's desk to end any misguided notions of a coup -- and fast			1
" @entity13 denies being involved in any such scheme , and @entity17 says that while he did receive a memo that made this kind of offer -- delivered to him by @entity65 's former national security adviser @entity64 -- he ignored it because it just did n't seem credible			1
according to @entity1 , lt. gen. @entity66 , @entity3 's powerful military intelligence chief , recently traveled to @entity67 to meet with him , where he " forensically tested " @entity1 's evidence , which consists of @entity70 messages between @entity1 and @entity13			1
while the affair has already brought down @entity13 , a longtime critic of @entity3 's military establishment and a well - known figure in diplomatic and national security circles in @entity76 , it could also damage the country 's civilian government			1
@entity13 's wife , @entity79 , is president @entity43 's spokeswoman and a prominent member of the governing @entity82			2
the man at the center of it all who is @entity1 , the @entity3 - @entity2 businessman at the center of this twisted tale ? born to a family of @entity3 immigrants in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity1 grew up in rural @entity94 , the son of two college teachers			1
after getting an undergraduate degree in nuclear physics from the @entity99 and an @entity100 in engineering from @entity102 , in the early 1990s @entity1 founded @entity103 , a @entity104 investment firm			0
@entity103 was politically well - connected			2
@entity1 's partner in the firm was retired @entity108 lt. general @entity107 , who played an instrumental role in president @entity111 's @entity110 ( " @entity110 " )			2
another @entity76 heavyweight , the former @entity35 director r. @entity113 , was chairman of the board of @entity1 's publicly listed company , @entity115 , based in @entity67			2
in the mid- ' 90s , @entity1 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to the @entity116 , and hobnobbed with the @entity117 at fund raising events			2
in 2003 , journalist @entity119 , in a book titled " losing @entity38 : how @entity127 's @entity126 " , relied on @entity1 as the principal source for the key part of his thesis , which concerned the five years @entity38 spent in @entity125 in the early and mid- 1990s			2
@entity119 described multiple attempts @entity1 made between august 1996 and 1998 to interest the @entity127 administration in improving relations with @entity125 , as well as @entity125 offers to hand over intelligence on @entity29			0
in his account to @entity119 and in later writings , @entity1 claimed to have helped draft a proposal for @entity125 to provide intelligence on @entity29 to the @entity127 administration , and that @entity125 had offered to arrest @entity38			0
@entity127 administration officials did not take @entity1 up on any of his offers to help because they viewed him as " a @entity137 living out a personal fantasy , " according to @entity119			0
and the @entity139 , which interviewed @entity1 , concluded that were was no " credible evidence " that the @entity125 had made any offer to hand over @entity38			2
in a 2004 interview with @entity143 about @entity144 , @entity1 , in his then - capacity as a foreign affairs analyst for the network , made another sensational claim : chemical warheads were being smuggled into @entity144 for a potentially catastrophic attack against @entity2 troops			1
and to top it off , @entity1 strongly suggested that the whole plan was given the green light by hardline @entity156 mullahs			0
the story had everything to attract attention -- mad mullahs ! @entity161 on the loose in @entity144 ! ( at last ! ) and the threat of thousands of potential @entity2 casualties			1
@entity1 now concedes , " this was an erroneous report based on information i had received from a former intelligence official on the ground in @entity144			0
i did not second source this story			0
" @entity1 also told @entity0 , " i have written over 170 op - ed columns , appeared over 200 times on television and have not once had a word of what i said retracted due to factual errors			2
" ( @entity1 has written one op - ed for @entity0 )			0
@entity1 told @entity143 in 2003 that " eyewitness sources " placed @entity38 and his deputy , @entity177 , in @entity156			0
asked by host @entity179 about the sourcing of the story , @entity1 responded , " i can just tell you that the source is unimpeachable			0
it is from inside @entity156			0
" there was , of course , nothing to this story			0
@entity1 now says , " at the time i made it , i believed the source who had given the data to me			0
" described as a " @entity2 nuclear proliferation and terrorism expert , " @entity1 told the @entity198 newspaper in 2006 that @entity156 not only had a nuclear bomb , it was seeking to " duplicate them in large numbers before revealing their existence to the world			2
" five years later , @entity156 still does not have a nuclear weapon , but @entity1 asserted to @entity0 , " they had in my view then , and it remains my view now , at least one nuclear weapon stored in component parts			0
" in august 2003 @entity1 told the @entity212 newspaper @entity211 that he had learned that the @entity214 administration had brokered a deal with @entity3 's dictator , gen. @entity216 , not to capture or kill @entity38 so as not to cause unrest in the @entity219 world			1
@entity1 told @entity211 " there was a judgment made that it would be more destabilizing in the longer term ( if @entity38 were captured or killed )			0
there would still be the ability to get ( @entity38 ) at a later date when it was more appropriate			0
" @entity1 provided no evidence for this claim , and the idea that the @entity214 administration would do a deal to let @entity38 go free is ludicrous on its face			0
@entity1 told @entity0 " i stand by my comments , taken in full context , throughout that article			0
" peeling back the layers of the story @entity3 's government and @entity3 and @entity2 journalists continue to look into story behind " memogate			1
" what is puzzling about all of this -- if the allegations are true that ambassador @entity13 used @entity1 to propose a deal to remove @entity3 's military leaders to @entity17 -- is : why would @entity13 use @entity1 to do this ? after all , @entity13 has many formal and informal contacts at the @entity8 , and @entity1 has a history of making sometimes exaggerated or erroneous claims , and his record as an unsuccessful freelance diplomat with @entity125 in the 1990s is a matter of public record			1
finally , if @entity13 was looking for a discreet back channel to the @entity8 , @entity1 turned out not to be the ideal messenger as he was the person who outed the whole affair in the pages of the @entity48 last month			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 and @entity262 .			1
