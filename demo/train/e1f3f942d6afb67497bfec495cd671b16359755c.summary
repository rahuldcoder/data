-- for @entity2 , being in the spotlight is a double - edged sword			1
the media have invaded her privacy and turned her into a carnival attraction , she told @entity7 on tuesday			1
but @entity2 also acknowledges that the media has also become a source of income for her , a single mother of 14 children			1
" that [ @entity20 magazine ] photo shoot was $ 100,000 , " @entity2 said on @entity7 's show via satellite from @entity15 , referring to the january cover that depicted her " bikini body			1
" " i was ashamed of that -- that 's not my character -- but i felt as though i needed to do something , " she said			2
" i did it because there were 14 hungry mouths			0
i own full responsibility for providing for my children			0
we have some of that money left until i figure out another way to make ends meet			1
" at this point , with eight 14 - month old babies and six other children between the ages of 3 and 8 , one of whom has autism , @entity2 does n't appear to have the time to take up a full - time job			1
she does have three nannies who help her during the day in shifts			0
but even so , @entity2 says she is constantly counting heads , making bottles or keeping a child from hurting another , as was revealed when @entity7 's camera crew spent 24 hours in her home			1
" you 're so busy trying to keep up , you do n't have time to think , reflect or feel anything , " she told @entity7			0
" you ca n't regret children , but [ my ] choices were childish , immature and selfish			2
i was n't thinking at that time			0
" at the start of the interview , @entity7 made it clear that @entity59 , her multimedia company , did n't pay @entity2 " a dime " and , in fact , @entity2 approached @entity7 to tell her side of the story			1
" everything that [ the media ] have said so far about me , and about me wanting to do this on purpose -- i never wanted to use children for fame , " @entity2 said , adding that her rationale for implanting eight embryos at one time stemmed from a variety of factors			1
there was what she calls " a childish desire to have a large family , " and " perhaps selfishness , trying to compensate for being an only child , trying to fill some missing piece inside , " she said			0
" i believe i 've always coveted that connection , that attachment to another human being , and it felt safer with children than a significant other , " @entity2 added			1
@entity2 emphasized repeatedly to @entity7 that she 's determined to take care of her brood on her own , without government assistance and without turning to adoption or foster care			1
" i will do everything as a mother to avoid that at all costs , " she told @entity93 , although she said she would never consider a reality tv show , which she considers exploitative and borderline abusive , or doing porn , despite having received three offers since the birth of her octuplets			0
yet @entity2 did appear in a two - hour @entity103 special that documented the first six months of her octuplets ' lives and aired on the network in august 2009			2
around that time , there were reports that @entity2 had signed on to do a reality show with @entity111 production company @entity110			2
however , @entity2 said that she " would never do a reality show , that 's been a lie from the beginning			1
" she told @entity93 that she has " been ashamed of myself to go through certain media outlets to provide for my children , " before adding , " this was my choice and my responsibility , and i did n't want to depend on anyone			2
" as a result , @entity2 said she lives " every single day , every hour of the day , with a tremendous amount of guilt			2
i feel guilty when i look at the older ones , they all have different unique needs , " she told @entity93			0
" i feel guilty when i 'm holding one or two and i ca n't be there for the others when they 're crying			0
" regardless of the way she markets her " @entity2 " identity , @entity2 said the biggest misconception people have about her is that she did it all for fame			2
" i 'm not a celebrity			0
i 'm a pseudo-celebrity catapulted into this media mess , " she said			0
" was i in denial thinking it would n't happen ? yeah			0
did i want it ? no. "			0

on tuesday 's " @entity140 , " @entity2 revealed what her life is like
she said the media has both invaded her privacy and been a way to make money
she said she never thought she would have 8 more kids , and doing so was a selfish choice
@entity2 said she 's determined to take care of her family on her own
