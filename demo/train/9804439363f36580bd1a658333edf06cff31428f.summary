-- farmers in @entity2 are helping to conserve threatened forests by cultivating an unlikely crop : butterflies			1
the @entity6 is one of the schemes using butterfly farming to help locals supplement their incomes and protect the environment at the same time			2
the brainchild of @entity16 biologist @entity15 , it 's based in @entity2 's @entity17 -- a region known for its biodiversity , but where forests are being cleared to produce charcoal and to open up farmland			1
" the main objective was to find an alternative income for the local community in the surrounding village and forest , and also relieve the pressure on the forest of people cutting timber , " says project manager @entity23			1
the butterfly rearing process starts with farmers catching a few female butterflies and transferring them to an enclosure where they can lay eggs on host plants			2
the farmers then collect the eggs and when they hatch , the caterpillars that emerge are placed on new plants , which must be regularly replaced to satisfy their voracious appetites			0
the caterpillars continue to feed until they pupate , and are ready to be transported			0
green in vogue at @entity46 the @entity6 project has been selling pupae to live butterfly exhibits in the @entity16 and @entity50 for between $ 1 and $ 2.50 each			1
of that sum , 65 % goes directly to the farmers , while another 7 % goes to a community development fund that contributes to projects such as building schools and hospitals			2
because most tropical butterflies do n't live for long , exhibits usually order new pupae every two to three weeks			1
farmers keep some pupae from each generation , so they rarely need to catch more female butterflies from the wild , although they sometimes catch new male butterflies to maintain genetic diversity in their farms			2
the project now uses 250 butterfly farmers , more than half of them women , says @entity23			1
he says the project 's own studies show that because butterfly farmers rely on forests near their communities to provide host plants for their butterfly farms , many farmers now support forest conservation			1
" because butterfly farmers get tangible benefits , they get money , people involved in butterfly farming conserve the area , " says @entity23			1
" they have their own forest area and use the money they are getting for replanting and other activities			0
" as well as training its own farmers the @entity6 project has helped train farmers for a butterfly project on the @entity2 archipelago of @entity98			1
the @entity99 consists of a netted tropical garden that 's home to hundreds of butterflies , all bred by local farmers			1
it was created as a tourist attraction , funded by admission fees , and like the @entity109 project the aim is to help protect the environment			0
@entity112 's erupting volcano boosts tourism " a lot of forest is being destroyed in @entity98 , " says project manager @entity114			2
" local people cut down trees to make charcoal to sell			1
people need it for fuel because gas and electricity is very expensive , so people cook with charcoal			0
" the center was set up to stop local people cutting the forest down , and to provide an alternative for them to earn money from			2
" @entity129 says the center has trained 17 local farmers to rear the pupae that provide all the center 's butterflies			1
it 's not a solution to deforestation , but it is helping , says @entity129			0
" the butterfly farmers do n't make charcoal anymore , so it has stopped that small sector of the community cutting down trees , " she says			1
like the @entity6 project , the @entity98 center funds a village development association , which is improving the local water supply			2
it is also trying to get local people to produce crafts and honey to be sold as souvenirs at the center			0
but there is a cloud on the horizon			0
both the @entity109 and @entity98 schemes rely on couriers to transport their pupae to overseas buyers , and they say they have been hit by courier @entity159 's decision to stop transporting their pupae			2
@entity23 says @entity109 has been hit especially badly			0
it now has to transport pupae by air cargo , which dramatically increases their cost to buyers			0
he says that until the end of 2010 the @entity6 project was selling a total of 50,000 pupae a year to 13 buyers , but now the project has lost all but one buyer			0
but @entity159 says it will be now discussing transport options with both projects , and hopes to find a solution that will let it resume pupae deliveries			0
the @entity98 center sees exporting pupae as key to getting more locals trained as butterfly farmers			1
@entity114 says : " we are hoping to expand to get more farmers involved			0
we need butterflies for our garden and also to export			0
if the farmers can export to @entity50 then the sky 's the limit			0

@entity2 projects training people to farm butterflies
projects give locals an alternative income and protect forests
@entity202 use 250 local farmers and sells pupae to live butterfly exhibits
butterfly farmers in @entity98 no longer have to cut down trees to sell charcoal
