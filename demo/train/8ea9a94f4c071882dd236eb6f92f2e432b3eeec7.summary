-- when @entity3 press secretary @entity2 said this week that president @entity6 had " substantially improved the tranquillity of the global community , " many observers reacted with disbelief			1
when the president refused to go to the @entity9 last week to see the crisis of young people flooding into the @entity12 because " he 's not interested in photo ops , " lesser mortals noted he had played pool with @entity17 gov. @entity16 , dropped by a brewery to have a beer and shook hands with a man wearing a horse - head mask			2
when he went to @entity26 on thursday and opened with a few sentences about the shooting down of a @entity30 airliner in @entity31 before joking about @entity32 and going back to his prepared text on infrastructure , many thought he had failed to take seriously an international disaster			0
they were even less impressed when he had lunch at the @entity37 and ordered burgers and fries ( not a photo op , of course )			0
it was not until 24 hours later that he took to the podium to promise an aggressive investigation			0
with the @entity53 causing the collapse of @entity55 and continued violence in @entity57 , the @entity57 dictatorship consolidating its power , the @entity47 failing to take steps to end their nuclear weapons program and @entity50 firing more than 1,000 rockets at @entity52 , the president and his team have moved decisively to brief the @entity60 on his passion for late - night intellectual dinners exploring physics , architecture and questions far more profound than the fate of the @entity67			0
it is as though the more dangerous the world becomes the more @entity6 hides in a fantasy world of avoiding the responsibilities of the presidency			1
he uses the office to surround himself with court jesters who distract him in an enlightened and noble way from the growing failures of his policies and the rapidly expanding threats to the civilized world			0
finally , as @entity84 president @entity83 continues to flex his muscles and expand his policies , there is a psychologically bizarre pattern of the president 's staff referring to @entity6 as " the @entity89			1
" the president refers to himself when he asserts " the @entity89 is loose			0
" of course with a president who last week used " i " , " my " or " mine " 207 times in one speech , the concept is beyond bizarre			0
the @entity3 staff , thinking somehow that this was clever , promptly turned the phrase into a @entity102 hashtag , # @entity103			0
@entity6 's idea of a loose bear is an unplanned walk to a @entity107 near the @entity3			1
@entity83 's idea of a loose bear is stealing @entity110			1
@entity6 's idea of risk - taking is shooting pool with a @entity115 governor			1
@entity83 's idea of risk - taking is handing out anti-aircraft missiles to rebels in @entity31			1
@entity83 's actions remind us of a time when @entity12 was threatened by a real metaphorical bear , as a 1984 @entity125 campaign ad referred to the @entity126			1
the self - image of @entity6 as a bear is so delusional that it brings into question the degree to which he is simply out of touch with reality			1
which brings us back to @entity2 's quote about tranquillity in the international community			0
what he 's channeling is @entity6 's personal tranquillity			1
from his perch in the amazingly @entity6 - centric world in which our president lives , look again at what the rest of us think of as serious problems			1
have any of the 1,000 - plus @entity50 rockets been aimed at @entity6 ? no. that is why @entity6 is tranquil			2
have any of the thousands who are crossing the border tried to move into the @entity3 ? no. that is why @entity6 is tranquil			2
is @entity53 an immediate threat to the @entity12 that is likely to blow up the next golf course the president is playing at ? no. that is why @entity6 is tranquil			2
if you can reduce your presidency to a @entity107 visit , a man with a horse - head mask , shooting pool and visiting @entity32 's burger joint for lunch , you can have a successful presidency as you have defined it , even if the world is disintegrating			2
the president 's detachment from reality is fast infecting the rest of his party			2
how else can we explain fellow @entity173 and @entity175 majority leader @entity174 stating this week that " the border is secure " ? this " tranquillity " line was a @entity180 slip by the president 's spokesman that reveals the deep gap between reality and the @entity6 @entity3			1
@entity6 is rapidly becoming the weakest president since @entity187 failed to stop the drift toward @entity189			0
self - delusion and a rich fantasy life are dangerous in a president			2
they often lead to disasters that are unimaginable until they happen			0
that is what we have to worry about for the next two years until he leaves public office for a private fantasyland			0
join us on @entity203 / @entity202 .			0

@entity205 : the more dangerous world becomes more @entity6 hides in fantasy world
he says @entity6 's self - image as a " bear " is delusional and out of touch with reality
@entity214 : @entity83 's *muscular* approach makes @entity6 look weak and *disconnected*
