in his speech , @entity1 acknowledged that the " change " he 'd promised would n't be easy , nor would it always be quick			1

" the @entity96 was quick to respond			0
" republicans are getting hammered in their districts from coast - to - coast for embracing a plan that kicks seniors to the curb by ending @entity103 and because they have not presented a single idea in the past six months to create jobs			2
republicans would fare better if they spent more time working to find solutions to the nation 's problems rather than engaging in typical , cheap @entity113 political tricks , " @entity96 communications director @entity106 said in a statement to @entity0			0
the money raised from the fundraisers will go to the @entity1 @entity116 , with the proceeds shared by the president 's re-election campaign and the @entity96			1
