when i started my initiative that led to the creation of @entity5 , my ambition was small and simple -- to help the poor people in @entity7 , a village in @entity9			1
i thought if i could give them access to a small amount of money , maybe their lives could change for the better			2
i never imagined the scale of impact that idea would have today			1
watch video : yunus on how we can create social fiction i began my work in the 1970s when i was teaching at a university in @entity9			2
the economic theories that i had learned stopped ringing true for me when i saw the misery of people all around me			2
i decided that i would drop the theories and go out to see if i could help just one person a day in the village outside of the university			0
after talking with some women , i found out how they became victims of money lenders in carrying out their livelihood pursuits			0
they were forced to pay exorbitant interest rates and subjected to other oppressive terms on the tiny loans they were given			0
i thought i can protect them by offering the loans myself			0
i gave 42 people a total of $ 27 of my own money as loan to solve their problems			1
they used that to free themselves from the loan sharks and were able to pay me back later			0
from this tiny experience , @entity5 was born			1
over the course of three decades , through this bank , we lent to more than 8.4 million borrowers in @entity9 , giving them fair loans and a fair chance to climb out of poverty			0
unlike banks in the traditional system , @entity5 works on the assumption that even the poorest of the poor can manage their own financial affairs given the right conditions			1
starting loans are about $ 40			0
today , the average loan is just about $ 200 and our repayment rates are at 97 %			2
our borrowers are mainly women ( 97 % )			0
they own this bank by buying shares of the bank with funds from their savings accounts in the bank			0
this system was designed to ensure that the bank focus on alleviating poverty as well as its commitment to addressing the needs of its clients			0
microfinance is now a well - known term			2
it has evolved on a much larger global scale with microfinance institutions to extend loans to more than 160 million people			1
it has affected the lives of about 1 billion people in developing countries			1
during my journey to build up @entity5 , i also created many other self - sustaining enterprises to address the problems faced by the people we worked with -- the rural poor			1
that was the start of social business -- a new type of business that focuses on solving social problems , rather than just making money , which i later elaborated in my book , " creating a @entity107			1
" a social business offers an alternative to the capitalist model			1
the essence of social business is to create a business that is focused on solving human problems rather than making a personal profit			1
it is a nondividend company designed to address a social objective within the framework of existing marketplace			2
it is different from a nonprofit because the business should seek to generate a modest profit , which would be used to expand the company 's reach and improve the product or service			2
social business has to be sustainable and is able to return the amount invested			1
but investors do not receive any further dividend after that point			0
i have created many such enterprises			0
in recent years , many international businesses became interested in collaborating with us -- including @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
we set up joint ventures with them , making use of their technological expertise to solve problems such as malnutrition , unclean drinking water , mosquito - borne diseases , unemployment and maternal health issues			2
we also created some successful standalone social businesses such as @entity156 , which supplies solar energy to off - grid villages , and @entity159 , which provides affordable cataract surgeries and other eye care treatments in rural areas			2
@entity163 has teamed up with us to establish a nursing college , offering tertiary education to rural village girls			0
in 2010 , i met @entity167 who , coming from a management consulting background , shared in the belief of bringing a business approach to solving social issues			1
together we created @entity172 , an incubator fund that lends to social business entrepreneurs around the world			1
@entity172 's concept is simple			0
we select the most promising business plans created by local people that are designed to solve local problems in a sustainable way			1
after recouping the initial investment , all profits will be reinvested into the business or used in some way to benefit the customers			0
@entity172 makes investments in such businesses through its fund and takes no profits			0
everything goes back to the community			0
since 2011 , @entity172 has grown rapidly and is operating in eight countries ( @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 )			0
with the world population crossing 7 billion people , it is more crucial than ever that we re-evaluate the concept of capitalism			1
will we continue to sacrifice the environment , our health and our children 's future in the relentless pursuit of personal profit and power ? or will we take the destiny of the planet into our hands by reimagining a world where we put the needs of all people at the center ? will our sustainable business model without seeking personal profit become a means to achieving those needs ? i have come far on my journey from lending $ 27 to 42 people in @entity7			1
but my ambition remains the same : can i empower the poor to change their circumstances and bring the power of business to solve problems by reorienting people from profit - seeking to enjoying the pleasure of being a creator of a better world ? this is the mission of @entity172 and the journey i continue .			1

@entity242 : i started @entity5 with the simple idea of helping the poor
@entity242 : today , microfinance has affected the lives of about 1 billion people worldwide
he says social business focuses more on solving social problems and less on profit
@entity242 : we need to re-evaluate capitalism , empower the poor and build a better world
