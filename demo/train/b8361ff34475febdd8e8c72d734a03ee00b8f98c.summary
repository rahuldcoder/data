@entity0 -- the three largest @entity4 cellular carriers by subscribers sell the latest @entity6 , and next week , eighth - place @entity2 will join the group			1
some people were taken aback this week when @entity2 , which only has stores in @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 , announced that it will begin carrying the @entity6 and @entity13 on november 11			1
among those grumbling over the news were some of @entity18 's 33.6 million subscribers			2
how , they asked , could a regional carrier get the coveted product before one of the big four ? @entity2 's infrastructure is based on a cell standard used by @entity25 and @entity26 , which now both have the @entity6 , but it is not common in other countries			1
@entity2 , formerly @entity2 , has a deal with @entity25 so that customers who travel outside of its @entity10 home base can still make calls			1
since @entity2 's network uses the same underpinnings and antenna bands as @entity25 , @entity34 did not have to make modifications to its phones beyond what it already did for @entity25 when it launched there in february			1
an @entity34 spokeswoman confirmed that @entity2 would begin selling the phone next week , but she did not respond to a question about whether the company needed to modify the hardware			0
the @entity13 , @entity34 's newest gadget , uses a special antenna receiver from @entity48 that works on typically incompatible networks			0
" @entity13 is now a world phone , so both @entity53 and @entity55 customers can roam worldwide on gsm networks , " @entity50 , @entity34 's head of hardware engineering , says in a promotional video			0
@entity18 's network runs on the global standard called gsm			2
that 's what makes @entity18 an attractive takeover target for @entity59 , which plans to bolster its own network using @entity18 cell towers , as long as the merger is approved			1
( @entity2 , along with @entity26 , are suing to block the acquisition , saying it will reduce competition			0
) while @entity59 and @entity18 use the same basic network infrastructure , their cell signals operate on different antenna bands			2
that prevents @entity18 from easily making @entity73 run on its network			2
when asked why @entity2 got the @entity6 before @entity18 , @entity76 , a @entity18 senior vice-president , smiled , having likely fielded the question before			1
" the iphone already works with their bands , " he said in an interview on wednesday			0
" they did n't have to change anything			0
" since the original @entity6 came out in 2007 , owners have been able to take the devices to @entity18 , swap out a sim card and use them on the network			1
but as @entity34 has added @entity90 and faster data speeds for @entity59 , the unofficial @entity73 -- more than a million in all , @entity18 has said -- have not been able to exceed @entity93 speeds			0
@entity59 's and @entity18 's @entity90 and so - called 4g networks operate on different bands			2
another @entity18 executive , @entity96 , recently addressed the issue publicly at a conference and in a letter to customers , though not in great deal			0
executives say that , while they 'd like to have the @entity6 , @entity103 is a fine alternative to the @entity6 .			0

@entity2 will be the fourth @entity4 carrier to get the @entity6
@entity18 , the fourth - largest carrier , still has no plans to carry it
@entity2 operates on the same network bands as @entity25
