-- a @entity4 pastor who canceled plans for his congregation to burn @entity7 on the anniversary of the september 11 attacks had the right to follow through with his intentions , @entity2 @entity1 said wednesday			1
in an interview wednesday on @entity0 's " @entity13 , " the associate justice compared the act of burning @entity17 's holy book to setting the @entity18 on flag on fire when asked whether the rev. @entity21 had the right to carry out the controversial plan			1
" we protect expression that we hate , " he said			1
" when you have a country of 300 million different people who think different things , it is helpful			2
it is helpful to tell everyone , ' you can think what you want			2
' " @entity1 , who served in the @entity36 , acknowledged that witnessing an @entity18 flag being burned during the @entity39 era triggered " a physical reaction of repulsion " in him			1
but , he added , free speech applies equally to popular and unpopular statements			1
" it 's so often i hear people say -- and particularly in college students -- ' well , that 's just so terrible what he 's saying			1
' i say , ' oh , you think that free speech is only for people who do n't say things that are terrible ? ' " he said			1
@entity1 , who was appointed by president @entity54 , also discussed his new book , " making our @entity63 , " which he said is intended as a lesson on how the court works for a generation of people who have n't had the same education in civics that he did			1
yet he said he was not bothered by a poll that found two - thirds of respondents could n't name a single @entity2 justice , and recalled a similar poll a few years back that there were more people who could name the @entity71 than three @entity2 justices			2
" i say that 's fine , if they do n't know my name			2
what is n't fine at all is they ca n't name the three branches of government , " he said			0
" then we 're in trouble			2
" reflecting on difficult cases from his 16 years on the court , @entity1 recalled two cases that found him in the minority			1
@entity86 was " stressful " at the time , he said , due to its magnitude and the short length of time the justices had to decide it			0
" a lot turned on the outcome , we feared or thought			0
and what i did , like the others , is the job of the court			0
... decide and control your stress			0
and keep yourself under control			0
" he also recalled tests of public school affirmative action plans in @entity105 , @entity106 , and @entity107 , @entity108 , where local officials sought to use race as a criterion to grant white students admission to the schools to integrate them			0
" i thought yes , let local cities work it out for themselves			0
the court ruled it was contrary to the @entity117 , the @entity118 , " he said			0
does @entity1 ever prejudge when he hears a case ? " yes			1
a lot , " he told @entity120			0
" think of how you make decisions			0
what is it to be open - minded ? it is n't to be a blank slate , " he said			2
" you start with something			0
but if your mind is open , you 're open to being persuaded to the contrary			1

@entity1 says free speech applies equally to popular and unpopular statements
" we protect expression that we hate , " he says , comparing act to right to burn @entity18 flag
@entity1 's new book , " making our @entity63 , " intended as civic lesson on courts
on prejudging cases , @entity1 says , " if your mind is open , you 're open to being persuaded "
