-- @entity1 and @entity2 must accept their $ 65 million settlement from @entity5 and move on			1
a @entity7 appeals court ruled monday that the settlement -- which was featured in the movie " @entity10 " -- still stands , despite the @entity12 ' claim that @entity5 did not disclose an accurate valuation			2
the suit stems from the @entity12 ' claim that @entity5 co-founder and ceo @entity15 stole their idea for the social - networking site			1
@entity15 and @entity5 deny the allegations , but agreed to settle in 2008			1
since then , the @entity2 twins have attempted to secure a higher settlement by claiming that @entity5 is guilty of securities fraud			1
" the @entity12 are not the first parties bested by a competitor who then seek to gain through litigation what they were unable to achieve in the marketplace , " chief judge @entity23 wrote in today 's ruling			0
" and the courts might have obliged , had the @entity12 not settled their dispute and signed a release of all claims against @entity5			2
" with both the district court and appeals court in agreement , it seems this may be the end of the @entity12 ' claim to any additional shares of @entity5			2
" for whatever reason , they ( the @entity12 ) now want to back out			0
like the district court , we see no basis for allowing them to do so , " @entity23 wrote			0
" at some point , litigation must come to an end			0
that point has now been reached			0
