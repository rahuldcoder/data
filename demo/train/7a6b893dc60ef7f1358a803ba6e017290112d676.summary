-- @entity1 has long been a sociological curiosity			1
with its mix of sweeping ranches and high - end shopping , it 's sort of a " country meets culture " destination			1
and you do n't have to drive all over the metroplex ( as the locals call the @entity1 - @entity15 area ) to have a good time			1
all the food , fun and fanciness can be found in the 1.5 - mile radius of downtown			2
while the core of downtown @entity1 has always been a thriving business district , it only recently began to attract visitors after 5 p.m. dinner and a museum take restaurants , for example			1
drive down any downtown street and it 's clear that food is definitely a big part of @entity1 " @entity1 has more restaurants per capita than @entity40 , " says @entity34 , president and ceo of @entity36 , a private organization that serves as downtown @entity1 ' leading advocate			1
he says that in the downtown area alone , there are 250 places to dine , ranging from the elegant @entity45 room ( 1321 commerce st. ) in the grand @entity46 to family - friendly pizza joint @entity48 's ( 1520 elm st. , @entity49			1
the fare is versatile , too : sure , @entity1 does @entity51 well , but the town also boasts plenty of places that offer twists on the basic burrito			1
@entity57 ( 1512 commerce st. , suite 100 ) , a hip eatery that opened in 2006 , serves up dishes like brisket pot stickers in a style they refer to as " @entity63			0
" the only thing that rivals the restaurant scene in downtown @entity1 is the arts scene			1
" we 've got the largest urban arts district in the country , " says @entity34			1
" it stretches across 17 continuous square blocks			1
" this includes the renowned @entity74 ( 1717 @entity75 ) and the @entity76 ( 2001 @entity77 )			0
visitors often overlook the @entity79 ( 2010 @entity80 ) , and it 's free			2
for music there 's the @entity84 ( 2301 flora st. ) , and theater buffs can see plays , musicals and big - name comedy acts like @entity89 at the @entity90 ( 1925 elm st. )			1
@entity92 's revival while the core of downtown @entity1 has always been a thriving business district , it only recently began to attract visitors after 5 p.m. like most cities , @entity1 felt the effects of suburban sprawl in the early ' 90s			1
in fact , as recently as 1996 , only 200 people called the central business district home , according to @entity34			2
now he estimates that in the next 18 months , there will be more than 7,000 residents just in the core of downtown			0
@entity34 and his colleagues believe people are migrating downtown partly because of revitalization efforts and partly because of environmental concerns related to long commutes			0
whatever the reason , visitors to downtown @entity1 are certainly benefiting from all of this migration			1
" as you get more residential , you get a number of supporting services , and that 's probably the reason for the number of restaurants that we have and the level of activity that 's occurring , " @entity34 says			1
shopping and bar hopping included in that hustle and bustle is @entity1 ' favorite pastime -- shopping			1
first , there 's downtown 's flagship store , @entity134 ( 1618 main st. ) , which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year			2
the @entity1 - born department store paved the way for other retailers to set up shop downtown , including national chains like high - end men 's clothing store @entity143			1
@entity146 ( 1508 commerce st. ) and smaller , stylish boutiques like edgy and sophisticated @entity145 ( 1514 commerce st. )			0
after a day of downtown shopping , you 'll probably be inclined to check out the @entity1 nightlife			1
( where else are you going to show off your purchases ? ) again , there 's no need to leave the downtown area : you could hit the historic @entity155 , where the preserved 19th - century buildings now house 21st - century attractions like restaurants and bars			1
it 's got its share of obvious places like @entity163 's , but also unusual eateries like @entity165 , which features an extensive wild game menu			2
for the opposite take on the city , go to the opposite side of downtown			2
on the east end , you 'll find funky @entity172 , where the vibe is young , artsy and eclectic			0
the area is known for its live music scene with bars like @entity177 ( 2720 elm st. ) featuring up - and - coming and even well - known acts			2
even dinner can be offbeat if you check out @entity182 's @entity181 ( 2914 main st. )			0
folks come for the unique @entity185 dishes as well as to sneak a peek at @entity187 , the restaurant 's transgender owner			0
@entity190 holds the newest side of downtown -- @entity193			0
the highlight of this area is the posh @entity196 ( 2440 @entity197 ) which boasts the trendy @entity198 on its 33rd floor			0
discriminating tastes will also appreciate @entity201			0
and just when @entity193 starts to feel like a @entity203 , you 'll spot the colossal @entity204 ( 2500 @entity205 ) , home to the @entity206 and the @entity207 ( just another reminder that even among all of this @entity193 privilege , you 're still in sports - loving @entity210 )			0
family favorites do n't forget the kids ; there 's plenty for them downtown , too			0
the @entity216 ( 1801 n. @entity217 ) offers marine life from around the globe in its 85,000 gallons of water			0

the @entity231 is the site of the assassination of president @entity234			0
the permanent exhibit focuses on the days leading up to the tragedy as well as the impact it had on the world			0
@entity210 temperatures allow visitors to be outdoors throughout all four seasons			0
and since there are more than 200 events every year , there 's sure to be some sort of festival or parade going on , no matter when you visit			0
