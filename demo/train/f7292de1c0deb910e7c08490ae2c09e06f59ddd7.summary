@entity0 -- @entity2 unveiled its new relatively low - cost smart phone on wednesday , aimed at consumers in emerging markets and those on a tight budget everywhere			1
but the one country noticeably missing from the rollout of @entity10 was @entity11 , thanks to the unfriendly relations with @entity2 's parent company @entity14			1
the @entity10 will cost just $ 179 without a contract in the @entity16 , about a third the cost of an @entity18 and about half the cost of a @entity20			1
@entity2 launched the new device in @entity0 , @entity22 , in a presentation beamed around the globe			1
ceo @entity25 said @entity10 has set its sights on the whole world			2
" it 's really designed to serve the half a billion in the world who next year will buy a smart phone for under $ 200 , " he told @entity1 ahead of the launch			2
many of those people are in emerging markets , like @entity22 , the world 's sixth largest economy with a rising middle class and a major smart phone market			1
the @entity10 wo n't be offered in the @entity16 until january and it will eventually go on sale in about 30 countries			2
in @entity22 , sales began wednesday			0
the phone starts at 649 reais or about $ 280 , compared to about $ 600 for the cheapest new iphone without a contract			2
it 's aimed at the country 's emerging middle class -- people who often do n't have computers at home			0
" @entity22 is an incredibly vibrant market , " @entity25 said			0
" people are coming on to the mobile internet for the first time			0
" industry observers at the launch said it should be a hot ticket heading into @entity59 , with its price and features making it competitive			0
those features include a big , high - resolution screen , the latest @entity66 software a long - life battery , 8 gb of internal storage and a 5 megapixel camera			0
" most people in the world ca n't afford $ 500 , $ 600 for a smartphone , " said @entity25 during the launch			0
" we think the industry should provide more for the consumer dollar			0
" in the @entity16 , @entity10 is being targeted at the pre-paid market , especially students and children			1
as for @entity11 , it is the world 's biggest market for low - end mobile phones , but the government blocks many of the @entity14 services -- like @entity83 and @entity84 -- that @entity2 says will make @entity10 the new smart phone of choice .			1
