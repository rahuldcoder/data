part of @entity1 is seeing its worst flare - up in years			0
here 's a look at some of the key questions about the fighting			0
what started this new wave of violence ? the violence certainly had not gone away , with rocket attacks from @entity12 and @entity14 military incursions in the @entity16 regular occurrences			1
but last month 's abduction of three @entity14 teens who were on their way home from school in the @entity16 brought the tensions to a fever pitch			1
@entity14 waited with bated breath , hoping for word that they were alive			1
when the bodies of @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 -- a dual @entity14 - @entity32 citizen -- were found on june 30 , the country was grief - stricken			1
the @entity14 government blamed @entity34 , which denied responsibility but praised the abductions			2
@entity14 carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the @entity16 , and launched airstrikes against targets in @entity12 that are used to lob rockets into @entity14			2
palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with @entity14 troops			2
has the @entity47 crisis reached a tipping point ? when was the @entity43 teen killed ? on wednesday , according to his family , @entity50 was headed to a mosque in his middle - class neighborhood of @entity54 , part of eastern @entity1 , which is populated by @entity56			1
three people in a car forced him inside , according to authorities and family members			0
he was reported missing and , about an hour later , his body was found in a forest in @entity1			0
@entity14 vowed a swift investigation and condemned the killing			1
still , clashes erupted in the usually quiet @entity54 neighborhood			2
residents threw rocks at security forces , and @entity14 authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas			2
some protesters also attacked two fellow @entity43 whom they mistook for undercover @entity14 police			1
@entity14 announced over the weekend that several @entity77 suspects had been arrested and that there was " strong indication " the killing may have been in revenge for the three @entity14 teens ' deaths			1
the clashes are the worst the city has seen in a decade			0
@entity14 has condemned the killings of five teens			1
who 's the fifth ? @entity14 announced over the weekend that a taxi driver had confessed to killing an @entity14 @entity77 teen in may			1
@entity92 , 19 , was kidnapped , stabbed to death and left in an abandoned parking lot			0
the suspect 's motivation was believed to be @entity43 nationalism , @entity14 police said			1
in the @entity102 , @entity14 's parliament , lawmakers unanimously condemned the deaths of all five young people , the @entity99 reported			2
who 's the beaten teen ? @entity107 is from @entity108			2
he was visiting his relatives in @entity1 when his cousin , @entity50 , was killed			2
two videos posted online thursday show @entity107 beaten by men wearing the uniform of @entity14 security forces			1
the videos do not show what led to the beating			0
there 's a dispute over what transpired			0
@entity121 , @entity14 's ambassador to the @entity32 , said @entity107 was among six masked people who threw petrol bombs and @entity126 cocktails , and three of whom had knives			1
still , that would not excuse " any excessive use of force , " he told " @entity133			0
" @entity107 says he was watching protesters and was " attacked			0
" a court has ordered him to house arrest for nine days at a relative 's home in a different neighborhood			0
his mother says the family plans to sue @entity14 authorities			2
physically , he 's " doing a lot better , " a family lawyer in @entity108 told @entity145 on monday			0
will this spark a ' third intifada ' ? that 's a question being raised by some in the region as well as global media			0
the term refers to two previous armed uprisings by @entity43 against @entity14			1
the first began in 1987 and ended in 1993 with the signing of the @entity155 accords			0
the second lasted from 2000 to 2005			0
" a third intifada is likely if @entity43 fail to distance themselves from the militants following the cold - blooded murder of three @entity14 teenagers , " the @entity158 's @entity157 wrote last week after their bodies were found			1
" put simply , there are solid reasons to fear that a third intifada could be far more bloody than the uprisings that have gone before			0
which means the task facing leaders on all sides could not be clearer : they have to calm this situation , not inflame it , " @entity169 's @entity168 wrote friday			0
but @entity175 reported that " many @entity1 officials expect the turmoil to die down			0
" it noted that @entity16 cities have not joined the violent protest			0
to some @entity43 , the intifada is the ongoing effort against @entity14			1
" the blood of our martyrs is precious ... and is fuel for the intifada and the resistance , " @entity183 , a @entity34 leadership figure and member of the @entity43 parliament , wrote monday on @entity187			2
what are @entity43 leaders saying ? @entity197 president @entity196 surprised many when he condemned the kidnappings of the three @entity14 teens			1
he faced heated criticism from fellow @entity43 for doing so			2
" @entity34 , which is now part of the @entity197 government in a unity deal with @entity206 , made no effort to conceal its glee , " columnist @entity202 noted on @entity145			0
@entity209 , @entity34 political chief , told @entity210 after the @entity14 teens ' disappearance , " i congratulate the abductors because our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation			1
" @entity43 leaders have called for an end to " collective punishment " by @entity14 , including the demolishing of homes and other military actions			1
and some have called on @entity14 to demolish the homes of those behind the killing of @entity50			1
@entity43 leaders have also condemned the killings of people in @entity14 military actions			1
@entity14 says it is focused on terrorist networks			2
more than 150 rockets from @entity12 have hit @entity14 in less than a month , and " terrorists from @entity12 opened fire at an ( @entity229 ) vehicle patrolling the security fence , " the @entity229 tweeted monday			2
is anyone calling for peace ? yes			0
in recent days , @entity14 have held anti-racism rallies to counteract hatred on both sides , including groups of @entity14 jews who were seen yelling " death to @entity56 " after the @entity14 teens ' killings			1
@entity14 prime minister @entity246 has called on @entity43 and @entity56 leaders to join his public calls for an end to the killings			1
" we do n't differ between terror and terror , and against both we will act harshly			0
and i do n't differ between incitement and incitement in the state of @entity14 , " he said sunday , adding , " we will not let extremists -- it does n't matter from which side -- bring bloodshed to the area			1
" last week , the family of @entity30 , the slain @entity14 - @entity32 teen , also condemned @entity50 's killing			1
@entity30 's uncle @entity262 , who works to bring @entity43 into @entity14 's high - tech sector , said he feels as good as ever about " the good people " he works with			1
" it 's no secret that every society has bad people , " he said			0
and the family attorney for beaten teen @entity107 told @entity145 's " @entity269 " on monday , " we need , really , all sides right now to just stop this disgusting cycle of violence where innocent children , both on the @entity14 and @entity43 side , are being killed and injured almost daily nowadays			1
" what does all this mean for peace efforts ? it 's unclear whether there 's been any real progress toward substantive peace talks in recent years , with each side blaming the other for preventing them			0
in april , @entity285 called it " a peace process that is going nowhere			0
" israelis and @entity43 may have grown further apart in what they 're hoping for			2
most @entity14 support a two - state solution , according to a new poll by the @entity292 , @entity175 reported monday			0
but a june poll of @entity43 , taken during the search for the three missing @entity14 teens , found that fewer than 30 % of @entity43 support a two - state solution			1
sixty percent say the five - year goal " should be to work toward reclaiming all of historic @entity298 , from the river to the sea , " the @entity297 found			0
but the majority support nonviolent methods of " popular resistance			0
" for now , the focus for all those opposing the violence is calming anger in the short term -- and stopping the killing .			0
