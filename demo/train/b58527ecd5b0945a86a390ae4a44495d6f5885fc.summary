-- when doctors risk their lives and sacrifice their livelihoods to go to @entity5 and provide desperately needed treatment to those suffering from @entity7 , what should be their reward upon coming home ? three weeks off , some say -- whether they like it or not			1
the governors of @entity13 and @entity14 instituted just such a policy friday , announcing that airport screening will be stepped up in their states and that any arriving passengers who 'd recently been in the @entity5 nations hit hardest by @entity7 could be hospitalized or quarantined for up to 21 days -- sick or not			1
measures such as these would affect people who lived in or traveled to countries such as @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , where all but a handful of the more than 10,000 documented @entity7 cases and almost 5,000 deaths have occurred			2
and it would also impact those who brought their medical expertise to @entity5 , doing what they could to prevent more people from dying or spreading the disease			1
so there 's a tradeoff : should the focus of @entity40 policy be to do everything to prevent anyone from the most ravaged regions from entering the @entity40 , even if it discourages health care workers from going there ? on saturday , the @entity46 and @entity47 said that it sets the baseline recommended standards , but state and local officials have the prerogative to set tighter policies			1
" when it comes to the federal standards set by the @entity46 , we will consider any measures that we believe have the potential to make the @entity40 people safer , " the @entity46 said in a statement			1
some @entity40 lawmakers , such as rep. @entity62 , favor a strict three - week quarantine			2
( that time duration is significant because it takes anywhere from two to 21 days from the time a person is exposed to @entity7 to when he or she shows symptoms of it ; if more time than that passes without symptoms , a person is considered @entity7 - free			2
) " in return from being allowed to come back into the country from a place where a deadly disease is endemic , you 'd have to enter a quarantine facility and be supervised for 21 days , " the @entity74 @entity73 told @entity0			2
some , though , think such a policy would be counterproductive			2
it might prevent some cases of @entity7 in the @entity40 over the short term , they say , but over the long run it could backfire if highly trained @entity40 doctors have even more incentive not to head to @entity5 to help corral the disease			1
dr. @entity88 , a pediatric immunologist at @entity89 , is one of them			2
he has spent four weeks working with @entity7 patients at a hospital in @entity93 , @entity26 , and is scheduled to return to @entity94 on saturday			0
health care workers already sacrifice a lot by volunteering their time to help those who most need it ; tacking on more time or not being able to venture out in public or go to work might seem like a punishment , discouraging people like him from doing it again			0
" if i lose three weeks on my return and do n't get to do the work i 'm supposed to do , " @entity88 said , referring to his job at @entity89 , " means this would n't be workable for me			0
" @entity46 director dr. @entity110 expressed a similar view earlier this month , arguing that stringent travel restrictions might create more problems than they solve			1
" it makes it hard to get health workers in , because they ca n't get out , " he said			0
" if we make it harder to respond to the outbreak in @entity5 , it will spread not only in those three countries ( in @entity5 hit hardest by @entity7 ) but to other parts of @entity5 and ultimately increase the risk here " in the @entity40			1
official : new guidelines coming ' shortly ' that said , change may be coming			2
some of it may come at the state level , as happened in @entity13 and @entity14			1
that policy shift was spurred by the hospitalization of dr. @entity133 , a @entity135 physician who 'd treated @entity7 patients in @entity24 and arrived at @entity13 's @entity137 on october 17 ; he eventually was diagnosed with @entity7			1
since then , a female health care worker who had recently been in @entity5 developed a fever , hours after touching down at northern @entity14 's @entity142 with no apparent symptons , @entity14 @entity139 spokesman @entity138 said			1
a preliminary test showed that the woman does not have @entity7 , @entity14 officials said saturday			1
but the unidentified woman will remain in quarantine at a hospital in @entity142 for at least 21 days			0
quarantined woman tests negative for @entity7 the new policy in @entity13 and @entity14 allows the states to determine hospitalization or quarantine for up to 21 days for travelers from the affected countries			1
a mandatory quarantine is called for those who had " direct contact with an individual infected with the ebola virus , " including medical workers who treated @entity7 patients			0
in addition , people with a travel history to the affected regions but with no direct contact with @entity7 patients will be " actively monitored ... and , if necessary , quarantined			0
" illinois gov. @entity168 similarly ordered " a mandatory 21 - day home quarantine for high - risk individuals who have had direct contact with an individual infected with the ebola virus while in @entity25 , @entity26 or @entity24 , " according to a release friday from his office			0
those affected by the order -- which will be implemented by local health departments -- include " any high - risk medical personnel			0
" " this protective measure is too important to be voluntary , " said @entity168			0
" we must take every step necessary to ensure the people of @entity183 are protected from potential exposure to the ebola virus			0
" such measures are on top of the federal policy requiring all travelers coming to the @entity40 from @entity7 - affected areas to be actively monitored for 21 days , starting monday			2
already , such travelers landing in @entity13 's @entity137 , @entity192 , @entity14 's @entity142 , @entity194 's @entity193 and @entity195 must go through enhanced screening			1
dr. @entity197 , director of the @entity198 , said friday that the federal government 's policies could change even more			1
" that is something that is right now under very active discussion , and you 'll be hearing shortly about what the guidelines will be , " @entity197 said , answering a reporter 's question about quarantines			0
timeline of first @entity7 patient in @entity13 ' eliminate not just real risk , but perceived risk ' some experts say there might be some middle ground between the two extremes of physically confining people in one place for 21 days or just letting them do whatever they want ( beyond , as is now recommended , taking their temperature daily and monitoring themselves for other symptoms )			1
one possibility is to have those travelers do more than temperature checks			0
dr. @entity226 , director of @entity228 's @entity227 , says one such measure could be checking daily for decreases in white blood cell counts or platelets -- which could be , but are n't necessarily , a sign of an @entity7 infection			2
and @entity235 , an infectious disease epidemiologist at the @entity237 , thinks there should be stricter controls on what a person who arrives from @entity5 does in his or her first three weeks in the @entity40			1
for instance , he thinks such a person should n't take public transportation or go to crowded places like bowling alleys , both of which officials say @entity133 did before he was symptomatic			0
how the ebola virus spreads public health experts say there 's plenty of scientific evidence indicating that there 's very little chance that a random person will get @entity7 , unless they are in very close contact -- close enough to share bodily fluids -- with someone who has it			0
still , there 's also a sense that authorities have to do something because of @entity40 ' fears -- rational or not -- and belief that the country is better off being safe than sorry			0
as @entity235 says , " you want to try to eliminate not just real risk , but perceived risk			0
" complete coverage on @entity7 @entity0 's @entity272 contributed to this report .			0

@entity13 , @entity14 announce stricter policies for those coming from @entity5
some say something similar , or more stringent , should be instituted *nationwide*
but the @entity46 director and others worry it may discourage doctors from helping in @entity5
