the cries from family members and shocked @entity3 are clear : call it what it is , a hate crime			1
they say @entity9 hated religion and that he was riled at the sight of his @entity3 neighbors : two of them young women who wore hijabs			2
the deaths of @entity16 , 23 ; @entity17 , 21 ; and @entity18 , 19 , had the hallmark of a summary execution : shots fired to the victims ' heads			2
but police in @entity25 , @entity26 , said the tuesday evening shooting appeared to be fueled by rage over a parking space			1
@entity9 ' wife said it was a dispute between neighbors			1
the @entity33 has opened a preliminary inquiry into the killings to look into whether the slayings violated federal hate crime laws or other federal laws , a @entity40 law enforcement official said wednesday			1
but the official also said so far investigators have n't found any indications of a hate crime , and evidence suggests the slayings resulted from a confrontation over a parking dispute			1
some allege there 's a double standard at play here			2
they say that if the situation was reversed , law enforcement and the media would n't hesitate to call it a hate crime or a terrorist act			1
it 's a hate crime when violence is tinted with discrimination			1
the @entity33 defines it as " a traditional offense like murder , arson , or vandalism with an added element of bias			1
" that bias can go , among other things , against race , gender , sexual orientation or disability			2
" to qualify as a hate crime , all that matters is that the crime was motivated , in whole or in part , by the offender 's bias , " @entity0 legal analyst @entity74 said			1
it also applies in cases of mistaken identity -- for example , it someone attacks a person because he thinks they 're gay , but they 're not			2
after the 911 attacks , some @entity92 men , who typically wear turbans , were mistaken for @entity3 and attacked			2
in the justice system , the old adage that words can never hurt you is dead wrong			2
labeling something a " hate crime " can make the law come down much harder on a defendant			1
it adds a new serious charge that can come with a heavy additional sentence			0
in 2013 , a @entity107 judge sentenced @entity108 -- a white man who killed @entity108 , an @entity110 , in a clearly racist attack -- to two concurrent life terms			0
he and friends had expressly set out for a night of targeted hassling of black people , screaming racial insults and yelling , " white power			0
" though it 's the states that try hate crimes as a rule , federal authorities can push forward their investigation and prosecution			1
he caught the wrath of the federal government as well			1
on tuesday , he was sentenced to 50 years in a federal prison			1
" the defendants targeted @entity110 - @entity40 people they perceived as vulnerable for heinous and violent assaults -- hate crimes , motivated solely by race , that shook an entire community and claimed the life of an innocent man , " attorney general @entity130 said in a statement			1
finally , even if a defendant is acquitted on a state level , the @entity140 can prosecute a case as a " hate crime			1
" case in point : in 2011 , a federal court convicted two @entity149 men of a hate crime after the state acquitted them of murder			1
@entity153 and @entity154 had repeatedly kicked a @entity156 man in the head while hurling racist slurs at him			0
that , too , has legal ramifications , and is not applied lightly			0
the feds have a very specific definition of when something is an act of domestic terrorism			0
it has to have three characteristics : an act that takes place in the @entity40 , that 's dangerous to human life , and is intended to intimidate civilians or affect government policy by " mass destruction , assassination or kidnapping			1
" probably the best example is the @entity177 shooting in 2009			0
to the victims at the @entity181 base , it was an act of terror , when maj. @entity183 opened fire on his fellow service members			1
but federal authorities never used the terrorism label			1
it met some of the criteria , but it was a legal move			0
avoiding the label made it easier for them to pursue the death penalty			0
there 's not much concrete evidence of bias , police in @entity26 say			1
they 're searching @entity9 ' computer and so far have not come up with anything that points in that direction , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation told @entity0			1
@entity206 ' wife , who is in the midst of divorce proceedings , told journalists she 's convinced religion had nothing to do with it			0
her divorce lawyer , @entity212 , said the shooting " highlights the importance of access to mental health care services			0
" he declined to provide any details about the suspect 's mental health history , but said , " obviously it 's not within the range of normal behavior for someone to shoot three people over parking issues			2
" on what is believed to be his @entity228 page , @entity9 is quite vocal about his atheism			0
those alleging it 's a hate crime are passing around a post attributed to him : " when it comes to insults , your religion started this , not me			1
if your religion kept its big mouth shut , so would i. " @entity0 can not confirm the authenticity of the post			0
by itself , it 's thin , said @entity0 legal analyst @entity244			0
it 's " one piece of evidence that suggests that he had a hatred or dislike for the @entity250 -- potentially			0
if that was the only piece of evidence , i do n't think it 's enough , quite honestly , " he said			0
contrast this case with the @entity255 shooting last year in which @entity256 is accused of opening fire at two @entity260 @entity259 centers			0
the three people he killed were @entity263			0
organizations that track hate groups described @entity256 , who is also known as @entity256 , as a long - time white supremacist			2
another indication of his mindset were the words he shouted from the back of the patrol car after his arrest : " @entity275			0
" soon afterward , @entity277 police chief @entity276 said investigators had " unquestionably determined ... that this was a hate crime			1
" @entity280 , who lost both of his daughters in the slaying , is sure the women 's hijabs had something to do with it			0
when his son - in - law lived alone in the condominium complex , the family never had any problems			2
but once his daughter moved in , wearing a head scarf that clearly identified her as @entity3 , trouble started , @entity294 - @entity18 said			0
" @entity296 , i think he hates us for who we are , " @entity280 said his daughter @entity17 told him			0
it has been two days since the attacks , and the investigation is far from complete			0
as details about the case are still emerging , a lot of questions persist			0
the @entity33 is assisting police			1
and @entity25 authorities are n't ruling out any options			0
" we understand the concerns about the possibility that this was hate - motivated , and we will exhaust every lead to determine if that is the case , " @entity25 police chief @entity309 said			1
but in the end , does a motive really matter ? @entity317 , writing in the @entity318 , put it best			0
" if the deaths resulted from a hate crime , it is an international tragedy			1
" if the deaths came simply because a man was consumed with a general hate for all humanity -- heck , then it 's still an international tragedy			2
because people all over the world have now been deprived of the services @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 would have rendered unto them			2
" opinion : 3 slain college students strived for a better world @entity0 's @entity333 and @entity334 contributed to this report .			2

official : an @entity33 inquiry is looking into whether federal hate crime laws were violated
family members and *muslims* around the world say it was a hate crime
police are saying it was a dispute over a parking place
