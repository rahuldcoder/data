@entity0 , @entity1 -- and then they came for the children			0
just when you thought @entity8 lawmakers could n't stoop any lower , these cowardly and shameful politicians grab a shovel and put in a basement			1
this fall , the @entity8 legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to @entity15 - born children of illegal immigrants -- the " anchor babies " that some @entity18 have been trying to marginalize for years			1
the lawmakers are cowards because , first , they go after illegal immigrants who do n't vote , lobby or contribute to political campaigns			1
and now they 're going after children who do n't vote , lobby or contribute to political campaigns			0
whom are they not going after ? employers of illegal immigrants			1
you know why ? because they vote , lobby and contribute to political campaigns			0
by the way , the term " anchor babies , " which refers to the tots that supposedly increase the chances that mommy and daddy can stay in the @entity15 even if mommy and daddy are in the country illegally , is n't just offensive and crude			2
the fact that @entity43 , an illegal immigrant from @entity44 who was famously holed up in a @entity47 , @entity46 , church , had a @entity15 - born son did n't stop federal officials from deporting her in 2007			1
the real anchor is a job , the kind eagerly provided by @entity15 employers who thumb their noses at federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants			1
in fact , right - wingers acknowledge as much when they argue that if we dry up the jobs , illegal immigrants will self - deport			1
what about their kids , some of which were born in the @entity15 ? why not stay for them ? simple : employment takes precedence			2
thus , according to conservatives ' own arguments , there are n't anchor babies -- only anchor jobs			0
also , you can bet that some of the same people who oppose citizenship for the @entity15 - born children of illegal immigrants also oppose the idea of granting a pathway to earned legalization -- what they call " amnesty " -- to illegal immigrants			1
why ? because , they say , you ca n't willy - nilly convert those who are illegal to legal			2
then how can those folks be so cavalier about making that conversion in the opposite direction by changing legal to illegal ? lastly , one of the things you hear from amnesty opponents is that illegal immigrants should certainly not be given @entity15 citizenship			1
it 's just too valuable , they say			0
but if it 's so valuable , then why are some on the right so quick to strip it away from the children of illegal immigrants ? do n't @entity15 citizens deserve more respect than that ? apparently not			1
in the late 1990s , the member of @entity106 leading the crusade against " birthright citizenship " was rep. @entity109 , @entity1			0
the @entity0 - area congressman proposed a bill to limit the privilege to the children of @entity15 citizens			1
the legislation did n't go anywhere			0
it could n't even get a hearing from some of @entity109 's fellow republicans , who cringed at the idea of visiting the sins of the parents onto the children			2
the same was true for another failed attempt by rep. @entity125 , @entity126 , who , in 2005 , proposed a bill that explicitly denied citizenship to @entity15 - born children of illegal immigrants			1
the bill did n't go anywhere either , in part because not enough @entity18 would even agree to give it a hearing			1
that same year , i discussed the idea with rep. @entity138 , who was then chairman of the @entity139 and the author of a sweeping piece of legislation called " @entity143 , anti-terrorism , and @entity145 of 2005			0
" among other things , the bill would have made unauthorized presence in the @entity15 a felony			2
yet even @entity138 , not exactly a softhearted liberal , would n't touch the idea of denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants			1
when fellow @entity18 tried to insert such language into his bill , he was careful to keep it out			2
there was a time when @entity18 knew better than to handle radioactive material			0
my , how times have changed			0
and now all the opponents of birthright citizenship have to do is change the @entity165			2
the 14th @entity166 makes clear that anyone born in the @entity15 , with the possible exception of the children of foreign diplomats , is a @entity15 citizen			1
" all persons born or naturalized in the @entity15 , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the @entity15 and of the state wherein they reside			2
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the @entity15 ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws			0
" grasping at straws , restrictionists and nativists claim that illegal immigrants are n't " subject to the jurisdiction " of the @entity15			1
so what ? my concern is n't that critics do n't know how to read the law			0
it 's that they do n't know how to read -- period			0
jurisdiction applies not to the parents , but to the children			0
as @entity15 citizens , they 're subject to @entity15 laws , but they also enjoy the protection of the @entity15 @entity165			2
the closed border / closed mind crowd may not like it , but that 's the way it is			0
i 'm not surprised that this escapes the state of @entity8			0
@entity218 supports the bill given all that 's happened in recent weeks in its jihad against not illegal immigrants but @entity224 in general , the @entity8 seems to have more than its share of people who slept through high school civics , and they 're being advised by lawyers who were obviously absent the day they taught " law " in law school			1
that 's not a good look			0
the @entity15 - born children of illegal immigrants are legally entitled to @entity15 citizenship			1
what part of " legal " do n't the critics understand ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241			0

@entity8 bill would deny citizenship to @entity15 - born children of illegal immigrants
@entity241 says bill is shameful attempt to *punish* children for their parents ' deeds
he says @entity165 explicitly grants citizenship to people born in the @entity15
he says many @entity18 would n't back this kind of a bill in the past
