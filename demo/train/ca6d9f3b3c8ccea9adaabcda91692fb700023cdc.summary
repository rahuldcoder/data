-- if you 're the kind of gal whose " me time " includes a glass or two of wine after work , you might want to consider how those drinks could affect your looks			0
that 's part of the message of the @entity16 government 's @entity14 , which specifically " encourages women to think about the health effects of regularly drinking above the recommended alcohol guidelines			1
" now there 's a mobile app that aims to drive that point home on a more personal level			2
this week , the campaign rolled out its " @entity31 " app , which lets users upload photos of themselves to show how their faces could age if they keep imbibing at their current rate			1
the app is available only for @entity34 - powered devices , although government spokeswoman said an @entity37 version will be out shortly			1
a web version is also available			0
the campaign 's @entity40 website shows a picture of a woman to demonstrate how the drinking mirror works , along with a warning that " deeper wrinkles , red cheeks and weight gain " are just some of the visible effects of regular heavy drinking			0
overall , the campaign aims to make people aware of the fine line between social drinking and drinking too much , especially when people drink in the home			0
men are not excluded from the conversation			0
a page devoted to " drinking like a man " warns that men who have more than five drinks a day are twice as likely to die of a stroke , and that having a beer belly can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease , high blood pressure , diabetes , sleep apnea and cancer			0
men and women can use the app by uploading or taking photos of themselves and entering data about their drinking habits			1
then , to show the potential long - term physical toll of drinking , the app shows them a photo of how they might look in 10 years at their current rate of alcohol consumption			1
even though the campaign states that " men drink more on average than women " and " suffer more ill effects as a result , " it 's targeted to women in an effort to play on their vanity , said a @entity16 government spokeswoman who asked not to be named			1
" in @entity16 , we have a troubled relationship with alcohol , " she said			2
" we 're focusing on women to try a different approach			0
" past government campaigns in @entity16 have targeted both genders , but research shows that women in particular " are often unaware or slightly confused about what sensible drinking guidelines are , " she said			1
the number of alcohol - related deaths among women aged 30 to 44 has doubled in the last 20 years , although numbers remain relatively small ( 70 deaths in 2010 ) , according to statistics from the @entity113			2
" with any public health campaign , it 's crucial to target it to specific demographic			0
it can be an age group , a gender or people with specific risk factors , " said health writer and body image expert @entity118 , who has a master 's in public health from the @entity122			0
" if @entity16 is having issues with more and more women engaging in unhealthy drinking then i think it 's a smart idea to target that population			1
" she pointed out that men and women can use the app and that the @entity40 website offers information and resources for both genders			2
so how much booze is too much ? on a daily basis , it 's more than two to three drinks ( about a 175 ml glass of 13 % wine ) for women and three to four drinks ( equivalent to a pint and a half of 4 % beer ) for men			1
about 38 % of @entity16 women and 49 % of men exceed the daily recommended limit each week , according to government statistics			1
" women do n't really accept that the amount of alcohol they 're drinking is excessive , " the spokeswoman said			2
" women are very receptive when you talk about calories in a glass of wine , and people do n't always make the association between alcohol and calories			0
