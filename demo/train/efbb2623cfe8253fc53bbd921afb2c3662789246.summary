-- close your eyes for a moment and imagine your life five years from now			2
what sort of scenarios pop into your mind ? how do you see yourself standing professionally ? what is the quality of your personal life and relationships ? though each of us may define " happiness " in different ways , it remains the case that we are inclined to see ourselves motoring happily toward professional success , fulfilling relationships , financial security and stable health			2
unemployment , debt , @entity22 's , any number of other regrettably common misfortunes are rarely factored into our projections			1
watch @entity29 's @entity28 according to most estimates , 80 % of the population hold unrealistic , optimistic beliefs about their own future			1
however , ask people whether the economy is going in the right direction or how they feel about the future of their country , and you will hear : " absolutely not " and " going down the drain			1
" @entity28 : @entity41 on our mistaken expectations collectively we are quite pessimistic about the direction of our nation or the ability of our leaders to improve education and reduce crime			1
but private optimism , about our personal future , remains incredibly resilient			1
surveys show that most people overestimate their prospects for personal achievement , expect their children to be extraordinarily gifted and hugely underestimate their likelihood of divorce and cancer			1
what always puzzled me was how we manage to maintain optimism in the face of reality			1
we experience failure and heartache , we read the newspaper -- we know the economy is unstable , but still we remain optimistic about our own odds			1
as a neuroscientist i found this especially surprising , because according to all classic theories of learning when expectations are not met , we alter them			2
this should eventually lead to realism , not optimism			0
by scanning the brains of people while they learned from positive and negative information about the future we uncovered a possible answer to this puzzle			1
surprisingly , when people learn of what the future may hold , their brains faithfully encode desirable information that can enhance optimism , but fail at incorporating unexpectedly bad information			1
( my fellow scientists and i were able to alter this tendency using transcranial magnetic stimulation -- watch the @entity28 talk to see how			0
) when we learn of @entity98 's success story , our brain takes note and concludes that maybe , we too may become immensely rich one day			1
but when told the odds of divorce are almost 1 in 2 we take no notice			0
this means that warning signs such as those on cigarette packets may only have limited impact			0
" yes , smoking kills -- but mostly it kills the other guy			0
" but at the same when we hear the housing market is going up we think -- " ohhhh the value of my house is going to double			0
" @entity28 : @entity114 studies the brain in love in fact , economists have suggested that optimism was a root cause of the financial downfall of 2008			0
the optimism bias was not only blurring the vision of the private sector , but also of government officials , rating agencies and financial analysts who constantly expected the market to go up and up			0
the belief that we are relatively immune to future harms can also put us at physical risk			2
take for example an e-mail i received from a @entity136 firefighter who read my book about the optimism bias			0
he says fatality investigations involving firefighters often include statements to the effect of " we did n't think the fire was going to do that " even when all of the available information about risks was there to enable safe decisions			0
the @entity151 government for one has decided to try to address these problems			0
as a first step , it has acknowledged that the optimism bias causes individuals to underestimate the cost and duration of projects			0
specific guidelines of how to correct for the optimism bias in appraisals were published in the @entity151 government 's @entity164 , which provides an overall methodology for economic assessment			2
adjustments for the optimism bias have since been factored into the budget of many @entity151 government projects , including most recently the @entity171			0
despite all these potential pitfalls , the science of optimism clearly indicates that , on balance , viewing the world through rose - tinted glasses is a good thing			1
we now know that underestimating the pain and difficulties the future undoubtedly holds lowers stress and anxiety , consequently enhancing physical and mental health			1
@entity28 : four lessons from robots about being human believing that a goal is within reach motivates us to act in a way that will help us attain it			1
this may , for instance , explain why optimists work longer hours and tend to earn more			2
yes , the @entity171 budget had to be adjusted to account for over-optimistic prediction , but if the human spirit were not optimistic , would there be anyone around to participate in the actual games ? my guess is that the number of athletes who expect to win a medal at the @entity207 significantly outnumbers the number of contestants who will mount the podium to be garlanded in due course			2
most athletes subject themselves to years of intensive training because they can clearly envisage the end goal			2
at the end of the day , to make any kind of real progress we need to be able to imagine alternative realities -- better ones , and believe them to be possible			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

people tend not to anticipate the future perils that face them , @entity29 says
people are pessimistic about the world but are optimistic about their lives , she says
@entity29 : seeing the world through rose - tinted glasses is good for people 's mental state
believing that a goal is within reach motivates us to act to attain it , @entity29 says
