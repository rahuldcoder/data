-- that @entity1 made an inspiring , gorgeous video of himself juggling around @entity3 earlier this year , and that it 's been viewed more than 700,000 times on @entity5 , is n't all that surprising once you get to know him			1
the 28 - year - old from @entity8 , @entity9 , has been juggling for 16 years , performing at @entity11 and @entity12 basketball games , in @entity13 and abroad			1
with his skills , it was a natural transition to audition for the @entity16 , which promptly cast him and sent him to perform in @entity16 theaters in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , and as part of a national tour			2
now in @entity24 to pursue acting and writing ( in between @entity16 fill - in work ) , @entity1 is still basking in the midnight sun of @entity28 stardom			1
@entity0 : how has becoming an internet sensation changed your life ? @entity1 : i now only eat the finest meats and drink only vintage wines			1
haha , nothing is different			2
i just think it 's a nice feeling that people took something positive away from the video			1
that maybe they got to see that juggling can be more than just a guy in a sequin tie performing as an opening act for a magician			1
not that there 's anything wrong with that ! @entity50 in @entity51 @entity0 : is juggling a normal part of your travels or was this just a one - off bit of inspired fun ? @entity1 : juggling is a part of my life ! i always carry some beanbags around with me , but i juggle mostly just to relieve stress and have fun rather than perform			1
i had just purchased a new camera and the idea struck me while i was driving around the country			2
it was really supposed to be a fun way to show family and friends my trip , and to try an experiment with the camera			2
@entity0 : did your juggling attract attention from locals ? @entity1 : for the most part in @entity3 , i was on my own			1
i did , however , have to accept the fact that i was some random dude juggling for goats in the middle of nowhere			1
how to be a @entity83 @entity0 : with all the juggling near cliffs and water , did you lose any balls while shooting the video ? @entity1 : i can proudly say that i did n't lose a single one			1
i definitely dropped them down hills and ravines , but i managed to get them back			2
@entity0 : juggling aside , what was the best part of @entity3 ? @entity1 : the dramatic beauty of the country			1
i literally felt like i was on another planet			2
driving around , you get this feeling sometimes like you 're the only one in the world who knows this place exists			2
it kinda feels like a well - kept secret			0
11 of @entity51 's coolest bars @entity0 : has the popularity of this video inspired more travel / juggling projects ? @entity1 : absolutely ! i made another @entity111 video immediately afterward that tracks my journey from @entity114 to @entity19 , which garnered quite a few strange looks , as there are a few more people in @entity19 than the countryside of @entity3			1
@entity0 : how long have you been juggling ? @entity1 : since i was 12			1
i learned on a family road trip to @entity121 ( @entity122 ) as our rv kept breaking down , stranding us in repair shops across @entity126			0
in a @entity127 © in the middle of nowhere i found a book called " juggling for the @entity130 " that came with three beanbags			1
i begged my dad to get it for me , to which he said the magic words : " yeah , right			0
like you 'll ever use that			0
" the gauntlet was thrown			0
i have n't stopped juggling since			1
@entity0 : do you perform live ? @entity1 : i do n't perform as often as i did in college , when i was known as the @entity140			1
you can @entity142 image it for a laugh			0
it was a position i pitched to the marching band director as a potential " alternate option " to a baton twirler			0
he went for the idea , and as a result , i ended up performing with the @entity140 marching band at football and basketball games around the country			0
that branched out into solo performances at @entity11 and @entity12 games as well as some gigs in @entity13 and abroad			0
since doing @entity16 , i have n't had as much time			0
@entity161 spills secrets of @entity3 's ' @entity163 ' @entity0 : how many countries have you been to ? @entity1 : probably 20			1
@entity0 : best country / destination for juggling ? @entity1 : that 's tough to say			1
@entity3 is obviously up there because of the response to the video , but i 'd probably have to say @entity172 is the best / most memorable juggling location for me			1
i went trekking there for a month in 2010 with a couple friends and brought five juggling beanbags along			2
i pulled them out on occasion and performed at various villages up in the @entity180 -- it was pretty clear that most of the locals had never seen anything like it			0
one time that sticks out in particular , was when our bus from @entity188 to @entity189 [ a village in the mountains ] got a flat tire and we had to pull off while they fashioned some sort of janky , quick - fix to keep the bus from falling apart			0
the bus was packed inside , and there were about twenty people sitting on the roof			0
while we were waiting , i stepped outside and did an impromptu juggling show			2
more people crammed on top to watch , and after the bus was fixed , they stayed sitting up there			0
a few miles down the road , blood started to drip down the front windshield			0
which , we later found out was because too many people were on the roof and someone sat on a chicken cage			0
i still carry a little bit of guilt for my association with that chicken 's death			0
although , they cooked it up in the next village and all was right again			0
@entity0 : where can people see more of your work ? @entity1 : my juggling persona is @entity224			1
you can see some of my juggling videos here			2
you can see some of my sketch videos here			0
and check out the @entity16			0
you never know , i might be in the show you 're watching !			0
