, the aftermath of @entity2 on @entity4 politics and on @entity4 policy is far from settled			1
the immediate question is why did it take so long to characterize accurately what happened there ? writing in @entity12 , respected diplomatic observer @entity13 answers that question by reverting to a well - used theme when he blames current policy and political problems on the quality of the intelligence			1
commenting on ambassador @entity20 's serial talk - show assertions that the @entity2 attack was " spontaneous , " he opines that @entity23 's " mistake was taking the initial intelligence at face value			1
" @entity13 reinforces his point by saying that he made the same mistake in his own op - ed by relying on " what the intelligence briefers told me			1
" odd that he would receive an intelligence briefing			2
equally odd , his assertion presumes that policymakers are simply passive clients of their intelligence officers			2
did anyone challenge the video - inspired , spontaneous - event narrative with information like that reportedly revealed to @entity41 by ambassador @entity42 soon after the attack : that this was a complex and synchronized assault ? what we know about the @entity7 attack this theme of intelligence shortcomings was carried over by multiple government officials cited in a lengthy @entity53 piece that outlined " shifting views within the intelligence community " as one source of the administration 's problems			1
according to the @entity53 's sources , early intelligence reports of an @entity61 connection to the @entity2 attack were discounted by the @entity64 , following the lead of the director of national intelligence			1
" the intelligence community made me do it " defense is a bit peculiar given the aftermath of the flawed 2002 @entity72 on @entity74 weapons of mass destruction			2
the outcome of that episode was a commitment by the intelligence community to give policymakers the benefit of the range of views within the community and to attach confidence levels to assessments			1
one wonders what level of confidence ( low , medium or high ) the intelligence community attached to its judgment that the @entity2 attack was related to an anti-islam video and spontaneous and how already emerging dissenting views arguing the attack was preplanned were presented to senior officials			1
in any event , given the administration 's existing narrative about its success against @entity61 and the inherent attractiveness of the spontaneous attack plotline ( a spontaneous attack would be neither predictable nor preventable and therefore less likely to invite blame for a lack of sufficient security ) , there were likely strong instincts in the @entity64 to accept and publicize the original director of national intelligence assessment regardless of confidence levels or competing analysis			1
strong instincts , but not necessarily good instincts			2
first of all , on a political level , the early story seemed to confirm earlier criticisms of administration wishful thinking in the face of similar events			1
sen. @entity120 , for example , criticized the @entity121 for labeling as " workplace violence " the 2009 killings of 13 @entity4 soldiers at @entity125			2
the army officer charged in the rampage had communicated with a known terrorist and was shouting " @entity130 " during the shooting			2
similarly , the man in an attempt to down an aircraft near @entity139 on christmas day 2009 , the final turn of one in a series of complex plots launched by @entity61 in @entity135 , was prematurely labeled an " isolated extremist " before all the facts were in			0
even more importantly , if wishful thinking can sometimes create political problems , it could take a far more important toll on the development and implementation of actual policy			1
the decision to intervene in @entity7 , though wrapped in a @entity151 resolution to protect innocent life , was also a decision to overthrow the @entity7 government , and @entity4 / @entity155 airstrikes continued until that goal was achieved			0
with that " victory , " @entity7 was predictably thrown into chaos : no central government , no institutions of civil society , fractious armed militias , a budding jihadist movement in the east , lingering regionalism and tribalism elsewhere			0
predictable consequences were not confined to @entity7			0
awash with weapons and fleeing mercenaries , northern @entity168 was broken off from the center and became a haven for a strengthening @entity173			0
how prepared were we for these predictable consequences ? clearly ambassador @entity175 threw his heart and soul and ultimately his life into trying to shape a positive future			0
but were the full government 's efforts adequate to the task we helped create ? although we were less immediately responsible for the overthrow of regimes in @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity135 , we will be no less affected by the outcome in those states			2
the same will hold true for @entity191 when the day of reckoning comes for @entity194 's regime			0
what level of effort is the @entity4 prepared to exert ? we should n't fool ourselves			0
our influence will often be far from decisive			0
but neither will it be trivial			0
and surely , in a time of global challenges and fiscal pressures , we will have to pick our investments and " interventions " carefully			0
but that will require a realistic rather than a wishful appreciation of events			1
over the past year the administration has repeatedly emphasized that " the tide of war is receding " and that " it 's time to do some nation - building here at home			0
" many have read this as advertising an @entity4 retrenchment from commitments abroad			0
some may think that wise and are prepared to live with the consequences			0
one only hopes that the calculation of the consequences has been carefully done , based on hard realities , and not on the kind of wishful thinking that would turn a complex , synchronized terrorist attack into a kind of jihadist flash mob			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 says intelligence briefers are being blamed for *confusion* over @entity2 attack
@entity230 says reforms require briefers to cover full range of intelligence theories
the *incorrect* *description* of the attack fits pattern of wishful thinking on terrorism , he says
