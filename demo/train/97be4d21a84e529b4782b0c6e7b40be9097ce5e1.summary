-- remember when oil giant @entity1 paid billions of dollars to clean up its own mess from the 2010 @entity4 oil spill ? then the company agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and pay an unprecedented $ 4 billion fine for the spill			1
in the latest development , wednesday , @entity1 was essentially told to stand in the corner when it comes to winning new federal contracts -- a potentially huge blow to the company 's bottom line			1
and it 's still likely on the hook for civil penalties the federal government hopes to recover for environmental damages			1
so , is @entity1 being punished enough for the deadly and destructive @entity21 spill , or too much ? it depends on who you ask			1
@entity1 says it supports nearly a quarter of a million @entity26 jobs and has invested $ 52 billion in the @entity26 since 2007			2
experts suggest punishments ranging from massive fines to banning the company from offshore drilling			2
however this all shakes out , it likely will send a powerful message to the industry			0
families of killed rig workers react to @entity1 settlement first , here 's what happened wednesday : the @entity26 @entity41 said it will block @entity1 from new government contracts due to its " lack of business integrity " stemming from the 2010 explosion and oil spill			1
it was a tragedy that killed 11 oil workers and dumped 205 million gallons of oil into the @entity4 in a slow - moving , 85 - day national drama that prosecutors called the worst environmental disaster in @entity26 history			2
this month has n't been good to @entity1			2
the decision follows the @entity57 - based company 's agreement november 15 to plead guilty to criminal charges including manslaughter , obstruction of @entity61 and environmental violations related to the explosion and spill -- an agreement that still requires a judge 's approval			0
what it means wednesday 's @entity41 decision means @entity1 wo n't be allowed to compete for new contracts , grants or other business until the company shows it meets federal business standards			1
as of february , @entity1 had $ 9 billion in contracts to supply the @entity26 government with fuel , most of it destined for military users , said @entity79 , a @entity57 - based analyst with @entity80			1
those contracts are n't affected by the @entity41 decision , the agency said			2
@entity1 said it 's already filed paperwork to get back in good graces with the @entity41 , said the agency is already preparing an administrative agreement to lift the suspension and highlighted what the company says it 's done to rectify the situation			1
" as @entity1 's submissions to the @entity41 have made clear , the company has made significant enhancements since the accident , " the company said in a statement			1
" the company launched an internal investigation immediately after the accident , publicly released the results , and has been implementing all 26 of the investigation 's recommendations			0
" what 's ahead the next big step in the case comes in february , when a civil trial is expected to begin over the government 's demand for civil damages under the @entity110			0
that case could draw huge new fines for the company			0
the disaster , in addition to claiming 11 lives , caused disruption to countless residents and businesses , many of whom counted on the @entity4 for their livelihoods , whether in the oil fields , fishing grounds or tourist beaches			0
for some , including environmentalists , the company could n't be fined enough or spend enough money to get back on their good side			0
" well , you know , we 're discussing the worst environmental disaster in @entity26 history , " said @entity131 , acting campaign director at the environmental group @entity132			0
" the punishment needs to fit the crime			0
" but , he said , the record $ 4 billion fine @entity1 is expected to pay as a result of the criminal case is a tenth of the maximum it could have faced , making it small consolation to @entity1 's harshest critics			2
the fine , while a record for the @entity26 justice system , represents less than three months worth of profits for @entity1			2
the company reported $ 5.2 billion in profits in the quarter that ended september 30			0
@entity131 is now rooting for the maximum possible verdict in the civil case -- $ 50 billion in fines			0
but he says there 's only one punishment that would really get @entity1 and other oil companies to sit up and take steps to prevent what @entity131 says is the overwhelming risk of another large oil spill : being kicked out of the game entirely			1
" i think a terrific minimum would be to bar them from offshore drilling , " he said			0
" that 's really the only standard that 's going to get oil companies to pay attention			0
" the head of a trade association representing @entity1 and other oil and gas operators in @entity175 and the @entity4 said wednesday that @entity1 has already complied with government requirements			1
" @entity1 has done everything that the federal government has asked and more			1
... this new @entity41 designation is another layer , " said @entity179 , president of the @entity180			2
" how much is enough , when the economy in @entity26 is trying to dig out of the recession , and energy ... is a very important component to getting @entity26 back to work ? " the @entity41 's decision could have a negative impact beyond @entity1 , he said , affecting other companies in the industry who have also complied with regulators			1
" the companies that operate out in the @entity4 , they can go anywhere , they 're global			0
they can drill anywhere in the world , " @entity179 said			0
" they have chosen to come back to the @entity4 in the past few years			0
... this additional statement and designation by the @entity41 has to play into their decision of where to put their capital			2
" @entity1 did n't directly address whether it believes it has paid enough for the disaster , but noted wednesday that it has spent $ 14 billion in response and cleanup costs , $ 1 million on restoration projects and $ 9 billion in compensation and expects to spend $ 7.8 billion more to resolve the majority of outstanding claims			1
owning up the company also pointed out it has acknowledged criminal responsibility , carried out recommendations made by investigators who studied the incident and has taken actions to strengthen safety and drilling standards that exceed federal regulations			0
@entity79 , the oil analyst , said that while the costs to @entity1 have been steep , they are bearable for the company			1
the big question is what happens in february , when the civil case goes to trial			0
@entity79 said she expects @entity1 , which has taken a long - term approach to recovering from the spill , will recover financially unless the civil trial nets an " irrational " decision			1
a huge verdict could pose problems for @entity1 , @entity79 said , but she said the government ca n't go too far in gutting the firm because of all the jobs and tax revenues the company provides			1
@entity1 has invested $ 52 billion in the @entity26 in the last five years , employs 23,000 @entity26 residents and indirectly supports nearly 250,000 jobs , the company said wednesday			1
" the @entity26 needs @entity1 as much as @entity1 needs the @entity26 , " @entity79 said			2
@entity0 's @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report .			0

new : trade association : " @entity1 has done everything that the federal government has asked "

@entity1 says it expects the *temporary* ban will be lifted soon
the @entity41 says the oil giant showed a " lack of business integrity "
