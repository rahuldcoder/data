is a 13 - minute silent movie			2
in it , @entity4 , the most famous auto racer of his day , races to rescue a damsel in distress whom a mustache - twirling villain has chained to a railroad track			2
( you can watch the whole thing on @entity15 if you like			2
spoiler alert : a few of the characters get killed			2
) a hundred years later , @entity19 , the most famous auto racer of her day , will be on a track sunday in the race of @entity25 life			1
very vulnerable , very motivated , she will be a hero to many in the audience and a villain to some			2
@entity31 have been running since 1959			2
they have been won by @entity33 and his dad , by @entity35 and his dad , by @entity37 and his dad , by the brothers @entity39 , by a 50 - year - old , by a 20 - year - old and by a whole lot of fine gents down @entity45			1
just ai n't never been won by no woman			1
i will be pulling for @entity48 , now that she holds the pole position for sunday 's race , for this reason and for no other -- just because it would be something unique			1
a giant checkered flag for womankind			1
@entity59 : @entity19 still has much to prove amidst @entity61 's best drivers you often see women in auto races			1
you just seldom see women win auto races			1
i have n't personally seen one cross a finish line first since @entity69 drove a @entity70 to victory in that movie " @entity73 : fully loaded			2
" excuse me , then , for being of the opinion that @entity19 winning the @entity75 would be a pretty cool thing			1
it would be up there with other unlikely things i never expected to see in my lifetime , like @entity81 maybe beating @entity82 for an @entity83			0
now , note that i did n't call this person the most distinguished driver of her day			0
or the best in any way			0
( except at posing in a bikini			0
) i have a high regard for the men of this profession , many of whom might find @entity48 's famous face in their rear - view mirrors sunday on their cannonball run toward @entity96			1
it would n't shock me a bit if her green no. 10 @entity99 ended up in the back of the pack			0
or up on some tow truck 's hook			1
or overheating under the hood like a ' 57 @entity106			0
if things do go wrong , that 's ok			1
they do to everybody , male or female			0
jerks come out of nowhere and cut you off			0
hey , consider yourself lucky these days if you go for a drive and do n't end up waiting for deep - voiced @entity121 and his insurance folks from @entity123			0
@entity59 : @entity75 : @entity124 for women 's sports with @entity126 @entity48 's life will be totally fine even if she does n't win			1
she makes a ton of money			0
she has a mean , green publicity machine			0
she even has a new boyfriend			0
( a fellow driver , @entity133 ) she still has her @entity135 ! ads , although , to be perfectly frank with you , i still have no clue to this day what it is @entity135 ! is supposed to do for you			0
she is resented by some for her fame			0
" what has she ever won ? " is a common refrain			1
hey , this woman placed third in the 2009 @entity145			1
do you know what the great @entity4 's best finish was in an @entity145 ? fifth			1
he still ended up in movies and doing endorsements and becoming the most famous car racer of his time			0
@entity48 has come a long way since being a high school cheerleader in @entity160 , @entity161 , during her @entity162 at @entity164 teens			1
she drove go - karts			0
she had a need for speed			0
she liked to get behind the wheel of anything with wheels			0
what else would you expect of someone born in @entity174 , @entity175 , where a man ( @entity176 ) supposedly invented the first automobile speedometer ? or from a woman who was brought up in an @entity161 county called @entity181			1
i mean , some girls are born to be debutantes or doctors			0
@entity19 was born to be first in line at the @entity187			1
she is not a true pioneer			0
i mean , we are not talking @entity190 here			0
@entity191 and @entity192 , a couple of @entity193 , drove a @entity194 in the @entity196 endurance race of 1932			1
( i can confirm neither did a sexy ad for a " @entity200 ! " website			0
) @entity202 has driven in the @entity145 500 nine times , @entity204 seven times			0
i once covered a @entity207 , @entity208 , race where a @entity209 driven by @entity210 was going 160 mph when it swerved into a wall and burst into flames , while a rival car went airborne			2
@entity210 was bruised and battered , but limped away to race another day			2
female drivers are tough , man			0
@entity217 's nitro - fuel dragster once had a front tire blow in @entity219 and she broke both legs when it crashed			2
if you go to @entity217 's website , the autographed items you can purchase include her fire suits			2
it is n't as if @entity75 has n't seen any estrogen along with all that testosterone			1
( no , these are not new products from @entity230			0
) as far back as 1977 , a true trailblazer , @entity232 , drove in the 500			0
she finished ahead of @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity33 -- not bad			0
so she never won it			2
you think it 's easy to race with the best , much less beat them , hey , let 's see you try it			1
@entity59 : @entity19 : why a win at @entity75 would @entity245 @entity75 500s attract the best drivers in the business			1
it is the @entity249 of its sport			0
it has given its fans countless thrills , ever since @entity255 ( daddy of @entity33 ) sped to the checkered flag in his @entity258 simultaneously with @entity260 's @entity259 in a photo finish that required three days to sort out			1
( @entity33 won and was handed a nice $ 19,000 , if you 'll pardon the expression , purse			2
) oh , the great competitors we have seen , from " @entity266 to " @entity267 , from the coincidental @entity268 ( @entity269 ) vs. @entity270 ( @entity271 ) clash of 1968 , from the climactic spinout of ' 76 when @entity234 was able to get his @entity274 to crawl and sputter across the finish line			0
what a blast it was in 1989 to see @entity39 finally win at @entity75 on his 17th try -- and on fumes , with a fuel tank that was very definitely on @entity281 what a pleasure to see the superpopular , bizarrely doomed @entity35 take the checkered flag there in ' 98 after two decades of being a @entity75 also - ran			1
to win on the same track where in 2001 he would die			2
on the same track where in 2004 the same race would be won by his son			1
legends and lore are what it 's all about at the @entity75			1
so i would n't mind this one becoming the @entity19 500			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity301 .			1

no woman has ever won the @entity75
@entity19 holds the pole position for sunday 's race
@entity301 says a win for @entity19 would be " giant checkered flag for womankind "
@entity301 : " i will be pulling for @entity48 "
