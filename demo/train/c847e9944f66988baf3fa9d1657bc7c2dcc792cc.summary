-- do you know why so many children think they 're entitled to a comfy life filled with toys , smiles and puppy dogs ? i blame @entity8			1
not " white " @entity8 or " nonwhite " @entity8			1
@entity10 came early for perennial critics of @entity12 when host @entity13 got sucked into the country 's racial vortex by insisting that @entity8 -- and , also , for that matter , @entity17 -- is white			1
it all began with a column by @entity21 culture blogger @entity20 , who is african - american			0
in the piece , provocatively titled " @entity8 should not be a white man anymore , " @entity23 noted that she grew up with " two different @entity27 " -- one in popular culture that was white , and one she knew in her household , who was black			1
she advocated that , from this point on , @entity8 should be depicted as , eh , a penguin			1
@entity13 was having none of it			0
" just because it makes you feel uncomfortable does n't mean it has to change			2
@entity17 was a white man , too			2
it 's like we have , he 's a historical figure that 's a verifiable fact , as is @entity8 , i just want kids to know that			1
how do you revise it in the middle of the legacy in the story and change @entity8 from white to black ? " after being criticized and ridiculed from here to the @entity50 , @entity13 accused her detractors of " race - baiting " and claimed that her comment was lighthearted			1
she did apologize , however , for her comment about @entity17 , saying she had learned the question was " far from settled			2
" i can relate to part of what @entity23 said			0
as a parent , i 'm also living with two different @entity27			0
but it has nothing to do with skin color			2
my two santas are " @entity8 " and " @entity63			1
" i 'm not worried about what color @entity8 is			1
teacher to student : you ca n't be @entity8 -- you 're black what i 'm worried about is the challenge of raising well - behaved kids in a society that sometimes make this difficult			1
as a parent of young children -- 8 , 6 and 4 -- i want to care for them but not coddle them			0
i do n't worry about being too hard on my kids or demanding too much ; i 'm more concerned that , like many parents , i 'll wind up being too soft , too accommodating and too eager to excuse their misbehavior			1
i want them to be kind , thoughtful , generous and grateful for all they have			0
and do you know who sometimes works against me on that last front ? @entity86 ' @entity8 himself			1
you see , the opposite of grateful is n't ungrateful			2
after all , it 's hard to feel thankful for something that you believe you 're owed			2
and if you want to know where the @entity95 culture of entitlement begins , try eavesdropping when your kids talk to @entity8			1
you 'll either get @entity8 or @entity63			1
in my first encounter this year , i got a @entity8			1
i know the difference because , over the years , i 've had plenty of @entity104			1
that guy -- who lingers at malls and department stores -- must work on commission			0
he encourages kids to rattle off a list of all the toys they want			0
kids come away thinking that @entity10 is all about gifts -- and unearned gifts at that			1
@entity63 does n't ask anything in return for his largess			0
a child gets toys just by being a child			0
on the other hand , @entity8 is old school			1
he requires that kids put some skin in the game			0
that 's what happened when i took my 6 - year - old son , along with his 6 - year - old and 5 - year - old cousins , to see @entity8 just a few days ago			1
we were n't at the mall or department store but at a @entity10 get - together at our neighborhood club house			0
when the boys approached @entity8 and began to rattle off what they want for @entity10 , he put up his hand and stopped them			1
first , he asked if they had been good this year			0
then @entity8 got on his soapbox			2
he told them to listen to their parents ( and their uncle ) and not fight with their siblings			0
and if they did that , he said , maybe they 'd get the toy they want			0
but they 'd only get one , so they had better choose wisely			0
they each asked for one gift and promised to hold up their end of the bargain			0
the jury is still out			0
this @entity8 really was a saint			2
he was the kind of @entity8 i remembered growing up , and i had n't seen him in years			1
throughout life , our kids will get plenty of encouragement to think of themselves as entitled			2
we should make the holidays about teaching them that , whatever they want , they have to earn by being good -- good to others , making good choices and practicing good behavior			0
some people say it takes a village to raise a child			0
but do you know what would really come in handy ? a few good @entity104			2
meanwhile , back in the cultural war , it 's a silly waste of time for @entity95 to argue over whether @entity8 is white or black			1
what matters is his philosophy on gift - giving			0
besides , this whole argument is positively 20th century ! in 2010 , @entity188 made up 16 % of the @entity95 population , and they are expected to account for as much as 30 % by 2050			0
everyone knows that , at least in the @entity95 and @entity191 , @entity8 is @entity192			2
so , this year , skip the cookies , and leave out some tamales			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

cultural debate *flares* over question of whether @entity8 is white
@entity197 says @entity8 's color does n't matter , but his **message** does
he says @entity8 's **message** should be that kids earn gifts but are n't not entitled to them
at holiday time , some @entity104 help parents do their *job* right , @entity197 says
