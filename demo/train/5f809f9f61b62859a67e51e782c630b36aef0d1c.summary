@entity0 -- amid security anxieties , indignation over @entity9 politics , the furore over unfinished media accommodation and astronomic costs , one key component of the @entity3 has been all but forgotten : the thousands of athletes streaming into @entity0			1
when not competing , they will spend a large chunk of their time at the @entity16 -- the traditional home for most of those taking part			2
@entity0 has two to boast : one in the imposing landscape of the @entity22 ; the other on the @entity25 's sunny northern banks			1
these are dwellings that resemble small towns -- you need a lot of rooms to house 6,000 athletes from 85 nations			1
the coastal destination surely proves an easy sell to any would - be resident for the month of february			2
if holiday brochures existed for a stay in the @entity16 , it might read : " upmarket holiday camp , with pleasant residential buildings that come inclusive with very own @entity42 's , round - the - clock dining room with flavors from around the world , fully - fitted games room -- boasting table tennis , pool tables and computer games -- free bar and 24 - hour gym , in great location just off the beach			1
" there are grass lawns to sit out on and enjoy the sun ( the climate is so favorable they say there are only three seasons , winter is skipped on the coast ) , traffic is non-existent and crime is wonderfully low			0
" just as importantly for the athletes , their accommodation is a stone 's throw away from some of the best winter sport facilities in the world , making it possible to have your breakfast and walk to the ice rink in under 10 minutes -- a first in @entity3 history			1
but with any holiday accommodation , and especially when you have thousands of happy campers to please , there have been a few teething problems			0
so the management would like to apologize for the swimming pools not being ready -- they are currently empty of water -- and an inability to fulfil the promise of creating landscapes in and around the athletes ' blocks			2
" in the brochure the organizers provided to the teams this area was meant to be a bird sanctuary ... but i do n't think they were able to plant the trees in time , " @entity95 short - track speed skater @entity93 told @entity1 " but apart from that everything else has been great ! " added @entity93 as she follows the gravel path which navigates across an area of wasteland separating the dining facilities from her team 's apartment building			1
we 'll guess from that she 'd give it a four - star rating as she crosses the road and opens the door to a building which , on every floor , has balconies festooned with @entity120 flags			2
flags which , incidentally , have already become a source of rivalry between athletes from competing nations , if the images posted on @entity127 and @entity128 are anything to go by -- the bigger the better			1
for the duration of the @entity131 , @entity93 will call this home			2
once inside , after traveling up four flights in an elevator that still has that freshly - installed smell , we walk down a clean , window - lit passageway to a door that has a @entity139 flag doormat daubed with a " welcome " message			2
@entity93 's airy , open - plan room consists of two single beds -- she shares it with a teammate -- with sea views from a decent - sized balcony , a modern bathroom , double - glazed windows , storage cupboards and an ample lounge area with television			1
@entity153 bikes as with all @entity131 , the organizers provide teams with a fully functional room with basic furniture -- similar in quality to a well - known @entity160 brand by the look of it -- and then allow the respective @entity3 associations to adorn the rooms as they see fit			1
in @entity95 's case , this entails some patriotic pictures hung on the wall , the provision of " good luck " cuddly toys , themed cushions and the aforementioned doormat			2
despite reports of pillow shortages in the mountain cluster village , both beds boast two cushions apiece			0
each room 's crowning glory is surely the uniquely patterned quilt for the beds that can then be taken home afterwards by competitors as a souvenir -- as is traditional for all games the 2014 quilts are light - blue with stitched diamonds of colored flowers			1
so if there have been problems with hotels occupied by journalists , it seems the @entity3 athletes are having a very different experience			1
" after five days i have no problems , " says @entity9 speed skater @entity198 -- a veteran of three @entity131 -- speaking to @entity1 over a lunch of @entity201 noodles			0
" and the food is very good			0
i prefer @entity205 and @entity206 food , which is good because they have a cook here from @entity206 too			0
" i 'm lucky , i do n't really have a diet because i use so many calories			0
this is the first time my country has hosted the @entity3 and i hope these facilities will help popularize my sport			1
" @entity217 ice hockey player @entity216 also gave the accommodation the thumbs up			0
" it 's very exciting			0
this is my first @entity3 , and i 'm enjoying it very much so far			1
the accommodation has been great			0
" one of the most striking attractions of the village is the way different nations bring their own distinctive characteristics			0
most notably the @entity228 , who are pedaling around on orange bikes			0
there may not be the recording studio that @entity233 laid on for the athletes , but between the gym , the bar , the dining room , the pool tables and the beach , there is plenty to keep them occupied			1
and if spectators find their hotels are closer to the standard of the athletes ' village compared to that of the media accommodation , we might even start to get excited about the great sporting prospect that awaits			0
let the @entity131 begin !			0
