@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 is @entity4 's to lose			1
on a day when the weather finally bared its teeth at @entity7 , so did the @entity8			0
at one stage of this historic championship round -- with two tees in operation for the first time ever -- another dynamic 25 - year - old threatened the fairytale @entity16 had been dreaming of			1
@entity17 tied @entity4 for the lead as the two - time major champion toiled amid the thick and unforgiving rough of @entity0 's 12th hole			1
but that seemed the catalyst for the home favorite to turn on the afterburners , as two eagles on his final three holes wrested the famed @entity29 ever closer to his clubhouse locker			0
the roar that followed his three on the final green was of the pitch one expects to greet the winning putt			0
it may well prove to be the telling blow			0
a six - shot lead going into a final round that should see a return to the benign weather of the first two days means a third major of @entity4 's fledgling career is within touching distance			1
@entity17 's only hope is to recapture the furious pace he set early on saturday			1
seven birdies drew him level with @entity4 before three bogeys halted a gallant charge			1
he will make up a final group with a combined age 14 years junior to that of five - time open champion @entity56 , who sits on five - over for the tournament			2
@entity61 's @entity60 and @entity62 , from @entity63 , both lie on nine - under with @entity65 @entity64 a further shot behind			1
but @entity4 is in such form it 'd take a return to the dark days of his @entity71 meltdown in 2011 to derail his procession towards @entity0 's honors board , and entry to an exclusive club			1
only @entity76 and @entity77 managed to win three majors in the modern era by the age of 25			0
by sunday night , @entity4 could have 75 % of a career grand slam sewn up and make that twosome a supremely talented hat - trick			1
" i never thought i 'd be able to be in this position , " @entity4 told reporters as torrential rain crashed down on the media centre roof , justifying the decision to send the players out early			2
" i 'm going to try and put all that out of my head because it would be way too much to think about , way too much to ponder			0
" not a lot of people have achieved a career grand slam and if everything goes the right way tomorrow , to get to three - quarters of the way there is some achievement by the age of 25			0
" i 'd be in pretty illustrious company , i do n't want to get ahead of ourselves but it would mean an awful lot			0
first things first , play a good solid round tomorrow and if that means i 'm going to @entity71 with a bit of hype then so be it			2
" it was fitting that a biblical downpour erupted just as @entity4 filed in to face the gathered press , for @entity0 has proved something of a perfect storm for him			1
intent on improving his record in golf 's oldest major , @entity4 spent the weeks leading up to the tournament shaping his game on the links courses of his native @entity124			1
it has made quite a difference			0
the 25 - year - old has arrested a decline that saw finishes of 25th , 60th and 116th in the last three years and now sits one solid round away from landing his first @entity3 title			1
with savage thunderstorms sweeping northwards , the @entity132 decided to operate two starting tees for the first time in the tournament 's history , sending groups of three out from 9am			1
this meant after a twilight finish on friday , @entity4 barely had time to hit the gym and watch a movie , as he has done after both rounds so far , before he was due back at the course			1
and like yesterday , his start was sluggish			2
a bogey on the first , coupled with playing partner @entity62 's birdie , saw his four - shot lead chopped in half immediately			1
he canceled out that error with a birdie on the fifth but seemed more content to protect his lead than exert himself to extend it			0
in weather that would make most @entity158 recoil in horror , the 25 - year - old reveled in the hanging cloud and spitting rain that swept across the @entity162			0
he recorded four birdies in six holes to close the gap on @entity4 , with @entity60 fighting to keep pace in the same group			1
when @entity17 rolled in a 30ft putt on the 11th , a shot for shot sunday battle between the @entity173 neighbors who first met at the amateur @entity175 battle between the @entity63 and @entity176 and @entity124 in 2007 looked likely			1
another birdie on 12 took @entity17 to 12 - under and when @entity4 missed a short par putt on the same green not 15 minutes later , the @entity3 had joint - leaders			1
if @entity4 was in any way perturbed , he did n't show it			2
in fact , he seemed to welcome the challenge			0
the contours of this strip of land on the west coast mean its predators are forever catching glimpses of each other			0
a huge gallery gathered around the 15th hole speculated as to whether the clamor back on the 14th meant @entity4 had made a birdie			2
seconds later , the huge scoreboard to the right of the green confirmed he had			0
that fleeting @entity17 share had now become a two - shot deficit			2
@entity4 refused to relinquish his grasp on his rival 's throat			1
a booming drive down the 16th and perfectly flighted approach offered an eagle chance which was duly swallowed whole			0
by this stage , @entity17 had bogeyed three holes out of four -- his round of 68 would include eight birdies and four bogeys in total			1
despite dropping a shot on the 17th , a ferocious @entity4 drive on the 18th was complemented by a five iron that landed barely 10 feet from the hole			2
the putt held its line and disappeared			0
@entity4 fist - pumped as thousands flanking the final hole rose to their feet			2
" the support this week has been fantastic , " he added			0
" it 's a pleasure to play in front of crowd like this			0
" walking onto the 18th green today i got goose bumps -- how loud it was , how much i support i felt from them			0
" i said yesterday i want to try and give them something to cheer for and i 'll try and do the same thing tomorrow			0
" i was conscious that @entity17 was getting closer but i never panicked and stayed patient			2
it was nice to come up with the goods when i needed them			0
" i felt like those two shots on 18 deserved an eagle			0
" barring a meltdown of similar proportions to the one @entity4 suffered at @entity246 in 2011 , when he blew a four - shot lead in the final round , the title is his			1
the 2012 @entity63 @entity250 's lead is the largest at this stage since @entity77 won in 2000 at @entity252 's			1
but having stormed from seven shots back to win the @entity250 at @entity254 in may , @entity4 knows how quickly a lead can evaporate			1
" i wanted to try and be as far ahead as i could , that 's why i was grinding over that putt at the last , " he explained			0
" whenever you have such a big lead you really ca n't think anyone else but yourself			0
" few people around @entity0 tomorrow will be thinking of anyone else either			2
