-- in early 2000 , shortly after @entity1 beat @entity2 by a too - close - for - comfort four points in the state 's first - in - the - nation primaries , @entity6 , then a @entity8 state legislator , swung through @entity9 to have breakfast with a friend in the @entity13 administration			1
as he sat in the @entity15 mess eating pancakes , @entity6 was shocked when an aide brought him a note that said president @entity13 wanted to see him in the @entity20			2
he did n't know @entity13 was even aware he was visiting			2
" he started grilling me on what towns @entity1 did well in and did n't do well in			0
he did n't have a paper in front of him , he just knew			0
he was asking me ' why did n't @entity1 do better in @entity26 ? ' his understanding of the political landscape of @entity8 is just amazing , " @entity6 , now the chairman of the @entity30 , told @entity0			2
@entity13 is taking that enthusiasm for the @entity8 , generated in no small part by the dramatic successes he and his wife have historically secured here , to the state party 's @entity35 in @entity37 on thursday , raising money and encouraging voters in his party to get to the polls on election day			1
incumbent gov. @entity43 has the most comfortable lead in the polls among @entity46 running for federal office in @entity8			2
@entity49 and @entity50 are in more competitive races as they try to hang onto their @entity15 seats			0
but it 's sen. @entity54 who is getting the most attention			1
the longtime @entity13 ally is running statistically even with @entity58 @entity57 , the former senator from @entity59 , in a race that could determine the balance of power in the senate			1
" @entity13 is probably the best person for @entity54 , " says @entity63 , the executive director of the @entity8 @entity64 at @entity65			1
" he 's custom made for a state like @entity8 that really appreciates someone who can get into the issues			0
" @entity13 's visit comes one day after @entity70 campaigned alongside @entity57 and with @entity46 activists here growing more and more anxious ( the state legislature 's return to @entity58 control looks like a foregone conclusion already ) it 's just in time			1
" the concern is if there 's anxiety bordering on depression about the bad news not just in @entity8 but nationally that might stop an activist from working as hard as they might to get out the vote , " says @entity76 , professor of political science at the @entity78			0
@entity13 's visit appears to be buoying many @entity46 already			1
with news of his headlining appearance , 1,200 people have purchased tickets to the @entity35 , the biggest crowd since the state party revived it as a fall fundraising event in 1991			1
normally 400 - 450 democrats attend			1
this year , some attendees will be watching @entity13 from an overflow room and the normally seated dinner has been scrapped for an earlier buffet - style meal followed by @entity13 's speech to a crowd in a theater - style seating arrangement			1
@entity8 has always been friendly to the @entity103 and they 're not going to neglect the state as @entity106 eyes another presidential run			0
in 1992 , just a few days after a tabloid broke a story about @entity13 's affair with an @entity112 state employee named @entity113 , a surprise second place finish in the @entity8 primary kept @entity13 's presidential prospects alive			1
he famously declared that january evening , " @entity8 has made @entity13 the comeback kid , " and went on to win the state in the general election as well			2
in 2008 , when @entity106 trailed @entity120 by double digits in the lead up to the @entity8 primary , she teared up at a @entity124 coffee shop as she told a voter who asked how she was faring on the trail , " i just do n't want to see us fall backwards			0
this is very personal for me			0
it 's not just political			0
" the next day , she answered @entity120 's crushing @entity132 caucus win with a three point victory in @entity8 , telling her supporters at her victory rally , " now let 's give @entity137 the kind of comeback @entity8 has just given me			2
" @entity106 will campaign here the weekend before the election , hoping to make a last minute move for @entity142 and gov. @entity143			0
by then , most voters will have made up their minds			0
but strategists say @entity13 can make an effective play for undecided female voters , especially with incumbent @entity46 women up and down the ballot			1
" she could win this race for @entity54 , " says @entity63			0
and if she does , the @entity103 are betting @entity8 will remember that in 2016 .			0

@entity13 is *speaking* at the @entity30 's @entity35 on thursday ,
@entity13 is there in part to support sen. @entity54 , who is up for *reelection* in a tight @entity160 bid .
normally 400 - 450 democrats attend the dinner , but this year at least 1,200 @entity46 have tickets .
@entity13 's visit comes one day after @entity70 campaigned alongside @entity54 's *opponent* @entity57 .
