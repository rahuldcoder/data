@entity0 , @entity1 -- the world is watching the situation in @entity1 transform before its eyes -- with an uptick in bombings and allegations of chemical weapons use -- but deciding what to do about it is no easy feat. in the capital , there is less shelling and fewer fighter jets are seen in the air than in the past , but the streets are as empty as ever in the wake of recent bombings			1
the increasing number of explosions is causing a lot of anxiety for @entity1 , due in part to the fact that it 's not clear which side is behind the blasts			1
the government blames " terrorists , " a designation that includes the rebels who are trying to bring down president @entity32			2
the rebels accuse the government of bombing its own capital in a ploy for sympathy			1
" they are all our children and it is sad			0
we are all @entity1 killing each other , " lamented @entity39 , who witnessed the latest tragedy : a bomb blast that killed at least 13 in @entity0 tuesday			1
equally frustrating for the @entity1 civilians who are waiting and hoping for international intervention in the crisis is the fact that the @entity47 has now said there is evidence that the chemical weapon sarin has been used on a small scale in the conflict			2
it appears that a line has been crossed , but the response from the world community has not been swift			0
president @entity57 said tuesday the @entity47 will wait until it has more details on the evidence of chemical weapons use before altering its strategy on the strife in @entity1			1
@entity57 previously called the use of chemical weapons a " red line , " but the @entity47 has not radically changed its approach to @entity1 in the days since an administration official announced the finding			1
the @entity47 does n't yet know " how they were used , when they were used , who used them , " @entity57 said			2
" when i am making decisions about @entity47 national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapons use , i have to make sure i have the facts			0
" on tuesday , a spokesman for the @entity81 said that the rebels had secured what they believe is an unexploded chemical weapon deployed by the regime in @entity86			2
the @entity81 will try to get the unexploded canister out of the country for testing , he said			0
" if the @entity1 regime does n't want to allow the @entity94 investigation team in , we will do all we can in order to present the evidence to the international community because we have the moral and national obligations to our people and our nation , " @entity90 said			2
at the scene of tuesday 's bombing in the capital , some people burst into tears as they spoke about the event and the general situation in @entity1			1
" they are killing our people			0
@entity110 and the @entity111 know they are terrorists			0
why are they providing them with weapons ? " asked @entity113			0
but the @entity47 says it provides only non-lethal aid to the opposition			0
the question of arming the rebels is being debated among the international community			0
@entity1 state - run television said the " terrorist explosion " also wounded 70 people			1
the blast apparently came from a car bomb parked behind the old building of the @entity129 , the @entity125 said			2
the @entity125 , which opposes @entity32 's government , said the number of casualties is expected to rise because of the large number of injured			2
prime minister uninjured after bomb targets motorcade members of the @entity1 armed forces were among those hurt in the explosion , the group said			1
but @entity90 told @entity2 he believes the attack was staged by the government			0
" the latest blasts are nothing but a farce staged by the @entity32 regime in order to beg for sympathy from the international community on the eve of the @entity154 meeting to discuss the use of chemical weapons by the regime armed forces against our innocent civilians , " the @entity81 spokesman said			1
he also said the rebel army was not involved in the explosion			2
" setting up car bombs in the capital or anywhere in the country is not a strategy that the @entity81 condones , " @entity90 said			0
" we reject targeting any civilian area and risking the lives of our civilian population			0
" @entity1 rebels attack military airports across country , opposition says tuesday 's blast occurred a day after @entity1 prime minister @entity179 survived a bombing that targeted his motorcade in an upscale @entity0 neighborhood , the government and opposition reported			1
the @entity1 observatory said one of @entity179 's escorts and five civilians were killed in the explosion			1
another escort and a driver were badly injured , the group said			0
the state - run @entity191 reported casualties but did not elaborate on the incident			1
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the monday blast			1
but the rebel spokesman said he believes that attack was also set up by the government			1
" @entity202 is a minor figure propped by the @entity32 regime , and he is not a strategic target to the @entity81 or anyone in the revolution			0
we actually feel sorry for the man who was appointed to be a prime minister , " he said			1
the @entity1 civil war has pitted @entity32 's forces against rebels seeking an end to four decades of @entity32 family rule			2
more than 70,000 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in the conflict in the past two years			0
@entity2 's @entity218 reported from @entity0 , with @entity219 reporting and writing from @entity220			0
@entity2 's @entity221 and @entity222 also contributed to this report .			0
