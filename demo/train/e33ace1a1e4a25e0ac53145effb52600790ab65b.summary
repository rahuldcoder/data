-- in less than a week , @entity1 announced an operating system to compete with @entity3 , while @entity4 announced that @entity5 will include free , online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at @entity1 's suite of web - based office applications			1
the fight between @entity4 and @entity1 is over who 'll be seen as the world 's most important tech company			1
and not more than a month and a half ago , @entity4 unveiled its new search engine @entity15 , which it hopes will steal market share from @entity1 and finally make it real money online			1
from the news of it , it 's a full - blown tech battle , complete with behind - the - scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other			1
it is , however , not a death match -- it 's more of an fight to see who will be the @entity30 , since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon			2
@entity1 pulled in $ 22 billion in revenue in 2008 , 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web			1
@entity1 makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses , charging $ 50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor , email and spreadsheet programs away			1
by contrast , @entity4 sold $ 14.3 billion worth of @entity49 and @entity50 and other business applications over the last nine months , making a profit of $ 9.3 billion			0
it made a further $ 16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems , which range from xp installations on netbooks , to @entity58 , to @entity59 to its server software			0
@entity1 now plans its own range of operating systems , starting with @entity63 , an open - source os for small devices like smartphones , and @entity67 , a browser - focused , open - source os that will run on notebooks and desktops			1
clearly top executives at each company look over at the others ' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them , or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money			1
in fact , they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example , @entity4 's behind - the - scenes campaign to scuttle last year 's proposed @entity1 - @entity85 advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the @entity88 settlement			1
but in reality , the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside			0
and it 's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world 's most important technology company			1
@entity4 would love for everyone in the world to be using its internet explorer browser to search through @entity15 to find a story from its @entity107 portal to email via @entity108 or @entity109 to a friend			0
add in a smartphone running @entity59 and an @entity112 in the living room for the kids , and you have a @entity4 family			0
and though it is much joked about , @entity4 is the dominant platform for software developers of all types , whether they are making small business software , massive online role - playing games or photo - editing utilities			0
@entity1 's ecosystem looks different			1
it starts with a @entity125 ( oddly running only on @entity3 ) with a default homepage set to @entity127 or a customized @entity1 homepage			1
from there you might go to @entity131 and then click on a @entity49 document sent to you as an attachment which @entity1 will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor			1
but most importantly , @entity1 wants you to search and travel around the web , hitting web pages that run @entity1 - served ads and @entity1 tracking cookies			2
you might think that @entity1 is a really cool company to give away all this free technology , while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection @entity1 is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium			1
so how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition ? browsers : internet explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market ( depending on who is counting and how )			1
that dominance remains , even though @entity4 's latest offering @entity154 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities			0
@entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity161 's @entity160 have all driven browser innovation over the last five years , but most people have not been convinced to leave @entity154 behind , despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced			0
why does it matter ? well , @entity154 installations come with a default home page , do n't they ? @entity1 's @entity125 , on the other hand , is a handsome , whiz - kid of a browser			1
it 's sleek and nimble , and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled			0
the address bar is the search box ( @entity1 as default , naturally )			2
each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files			0
the sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes , the rest are unaffected			0
meanwhile , lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser			0
@entity67 also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share			2
online search : @entity1 's name now means search to most users			1
@entity1 's search engine means money to @entity1			1
in june , it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to @entity200 web users			0
in the first three months of 2009 , @entity1 pulled in $ 5.2 billion in revenue , a majority of which came from @entity203 , an auction - based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query			2
@entity4 recently debuted @entity15 , a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to @entity1			2
it 's got some fine innovations , and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data , rather than just retrieving links			1
still , despite these improvements , a $ 100 million ad campaign , and generous press coverage that treats @entity15 like an underdog , @entity15 gained only a point in june to get @entity4 8.2 percent of all searches			0
operating systems : @entity4 has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting @entity226 and @entity227 , the frameworks that @entity3 have been built around			2
@entity4 is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world			0
by copying its competitors ' best features , leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators , @entity4 has held on to its lead in the os market for almost 30 years			0
that 's despite challenges from @entity242 , @entity161 and @entity243			0
@entity4 's newest version , @entity3 7 , will be available in the fall			1
early reviews say the @entity67 boots quickly and sleeps fast , and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike @entity58 , the successor to @entity251			2
@entity4 also dominates in the business world , where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around @entity255			0
@entity4 is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices , which it first launched in 2000			0
its os advantages are immense			0
it has millions of users who know nothing else and who like @entity3			2
there are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on @entity3			2
thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware			0
and familiarity with @entity4 software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs			0
by contrast , @entity1 first stepped into the @entity67 game in 2007 when it announced its android operating system for small devices			1
@entity1 estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year			2
last week , @entity1 announced , but did not show off , a new os to compete with @entity3 , dubbing it @entity67 that name signifies that @entity1 's os will be for the web and browser - based			1
it hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser , instead of on top of the os as developers for @entity3 and @entity290 do			1
it will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser , allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help			0
advertising : @entity1 is largely powered by its innovative auction - based text ads on its own site , but then expanded into serving ads on other people 's sites with the @entity306 program			1
it bought the ad - serving and behavioral - profiling giant @entity309 in 2007 for more than $ 3 billion , and has ventured into mobile , print , radio and television ads. @entity4 has struggled to replicate @entity1 's online advertising success			1
despite owning @entity107 -- a portal that is second only to @entity85 as a destination -- @entity4 has not made money on the internet			0
to turbocharge its ad - delivery technology , it paid more than $ 6 billion in cash in 2007 for @entity321 , a full - service online advertising concern			0
instead , @entity4 's online ad business lost $ 1.2 billion in 2008 , double what it lost in 2007			2
the company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $ 3.2 billion it took in last year , but has not said it would make a profit			0
contrary to what some might have you believe , the benefits of the @entity1 - @entity4 competition are immense			1
@entity4 had largely grown complacent until @entity1 came along to shake up categories			2
@entity131 's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made @entity4 hustle to upgrade its popular , though not user - friendly , web e-mail service			2
@entity339 led to @entity4 's @entity340 , which now bests @entity1 's efforts in some ways			1
@entity1 has been winning the fight for the last few years , showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the @entity345			2
but the pendulum may be slowing , or even poised to swing the other way			0
with the innovations in @entity15 and the promise that @entity4 's online office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the @entity1 equivalent , @entity4 is taking on @entity1 where it matters for users : on the field of innovation			1
and that will make for an interesting race , no matter which horse you prefer to ride			0
