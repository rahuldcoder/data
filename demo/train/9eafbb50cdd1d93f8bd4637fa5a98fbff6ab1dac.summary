@entity0 , @entity1 -- a spontaneous burst of applause broke out at a saturday press conference in @entity0 , @entity1 , when the city 's mayor said the @entity8 should crest overnight -- about 12 feet higher than flood stage , but several inches short of what had been feared			1
" this is great news , " said mayor @entity11			2
this prediction from the @entity14 proved a rare bright spot in what has been , and continues to be , a trying time for citizens in @entity0 and neighboring communities			1
the @entity8 , which locals call " the mouse " after the @entity22 translation of its name , flows through the center of @entity0 , a city of about 36,000			1
about a third of the city 's population is under evacuation orders , while at least 3,000 homes have been flooded			1
one resident , @entity30 , told @entity2 about how he , his wife and two children feverishly packed up their belongings ahead of the approaching waters			2
what they could move out is stashed in a garage , while the family has found a temporary home in a relative 's basement			2
" words kind of escape me , " said @entity30 , describing his feeling after later sneaking back toward his home and seeing it under water			0
" it 's a sense of despair ... and it 's maybe a check on some of the things that you hold dear			2
" @entity51 said he spotted the silver chimney and black roof of his house , where he has lived since 1968 , on saturday -- with the rest of the dwelling under water			0
" i hate to say it , but i had tears in my eyes this morning			0
it 's a sickening feeling because i knew when i come back it wo n't hardly be worth fixing			1
it 's almost 100 years old , " he said			2
these personal struggles come as local , state and federal authorities rush to minimize the damage to property and maximize security and safety of residents			0
to the latter point , @entity0 officials announced a " boil - water order " saturday afternoon , telling residents to boil tap water for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms			1
around 6 p.m. saturday , following a hot and sunny day , residents got a fresh scare when tornado sirens started blaring as a powerful thunderstorm bore down on @entity0			1
@entity81 , a @entity14 official , told @entity2 , " the city of @entity0 pulled the sirens out of extreme caution			1
" the clouds indicated a system that could generate tornadoes , but the intent was even more to alert the scores of @entity90 , police and other personnel working to address the flooding to seek cover from the coming storm			0
" there was no sign of vertical rotation or tornadoes , " said @entity81 , noting the storm system should pass through the city by 7:30 p.m. the focal point in @entity0 continues to be the @entity103 , a critical north - south route through town			1
officials have been working round - the - clock to prevent the river from inundating nearby routes , all part of larger efforts aimed at preventing @entity0 by effectively being split in half by the flooding			1
" it 's really important that ( @entity103 ) bridge stays open , " said @entity115 , spokeswoman for the @entity116 of @entity117			2
on saturday afternoon , the @entity14 reported water levels at that bridge stood at 1,561.62 feet with an expected crest around midnight of 1,561.8 feet			1
this is well above the flood stage of 1,549 feet , but still below the worst forecasts -- and the reason for the outpouring of relief , after @entity129 's announcement at a press conference			1
@entity131 rep. @entity131 said he had been in touch with officials in @entity134 -- which has authorized @entity136 to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges			0
" you 're seeing people at the highest levels working together , putting politics behind them , " said @entity1 's lone congressman			1
" and i 've seen @entity149 flags ( that ) reminded me how , in the face of challenges , we come together as a country			0
" @entity131 , though , cautioned that this was a " marathon " that still had a ways to go			0
for instance , water levels near the @entity103 were still expected to remain around 1,561 feet through tuesday -- well above the record of 1,558 feet -- with a slow drop over the coming week			2
and the worst is yet to come in other @entity1 locales			1
in the small city of @entity164 , for instance , water levels saturday morning were 5 feet above flood stage and forecast to rise much further , to 30.5 feet , through overnight sunday			1
this situation prompted the evacuation saturday of the city 's 350 residents as water from the @entity8 began to slosh up a main street through town , according to a @entity149 @entity174 official			1
water began flowing up @entity176 on the northwest side of town early saturday morning , said @entity178 , a public information officer with the @entity174			0
the river stood at five feet above flood stage saturday morning			0
it is forecast to rise nearly 2 1/2 more feet at @entity164 before cresting on monday , according to the @entity14			1
crews are engaged in a " touch and go " struggle to build a temporary levee to stop the flow of water through the now - vacant town , according to @entity178			0
" we have not given up , " @entity178 said			0
to the northeast , in @entity0 , about 15 % to 20 % of the city was under water as of friday			1
fire department battalion chief @entity192 called the conditions there " by far the toughest we 've ever seen			0
" @entity195 and @entity196 own one of those homes			0
located less than a mile from the @entity8 , it 's already flooded and more water is expected , @entity199 said saturday			1
even though a crew of more than three dozen friends and family helped them evacuate on monday -- scouring the house of everything that was n't attached to the walls , @entity196 said his wife is still devastated			2
" we 've had many homes over our life and she finally got the house of her dreams , " he said			0
" she is absolutely devastated , bawling all the time			0
" @entity196 , who built the house , is n't so busted up			2
no one was hurt , and they can build again , he said			0
still , he said , " it will never be the same			0
" @entity30 voiced similar sentiments after the floodwaters forced him and his family out of their home -- leaving them safe , even as they 're left largely helpless without flood insurance as the waters roll in			2
an overwhelming positive from this whole ordeal , he said , is how city residents have rallied to support one another			0
" the community that we live in , they 're absolutely great , " said @entity30			0
" all around , there are people helping people , strangers helping you move , everyone is so helpful			0
" i just ca n't say enough about living in this town ... it 's comforting to know that people care for you , even strangers			1
" @entity2 's @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			2

new : tornado sirens go off in @entity0 , but there 's no sign of any twisters
@entity14 says the @entity8 's crest will be below forecasts
the worst is n't over , though , as rising waters prompted the evacuation of @entity164 , @entity1
the @entity8 has already topped its record crest from 1881
