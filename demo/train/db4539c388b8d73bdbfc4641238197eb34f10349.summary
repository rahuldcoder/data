-- the debate on how to reduce health care costs that are out of control seems more polarized than ever			1
many @entity4 are recommending that @entity5 be privatized or even abolished since @entity5 , @entity6 , and the @entity7 accounted for 21 % of the federal budget in 2011 , or $ 769 billion , and even more in 2012			0
many democrats are advocating raising taxes and letting the deficit increase in the near term			0
there 's not much common ground when the issues are framed in this way			1
here 's an alternative : let 's address the underlying causes of what make us sick and what make us well			1
this is a radical approach " radical " comes from the @entity25 word meaning " root			0
" when we address the root causes of a problem , we are more likely to solve it			0
we can make much better health care available for more people at far lower costs when we treat the causes rather than the symptoms			1
so what are the root causes ? they are the lifestyle choices that we make each day : what we eat , how we respond to stress , whether or not we smoke , how much we exercise , and how much love , intimacy and social support we have in our lives			1
opinion : @entity46 manages disease , not health currently , over 75 % of the $ 2.8 trillion in health care costs are due to chronic diseases , such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes , that can be largely prevented by making comprehensive lifestyle changes			1
we do n't need to wait for a new drug or laser or high - tech breakthrough ; we simply need to put into practice what we already know			0
for example , one study of 23,000 people shows that walking for just 30 minutes every day , not smoking , eating a reasonably healthy diet , and keeping a healthy weight prevented 93 % of diabetes , 81 % of heart attacks , 50 % of strokes and 36 % of all cancers			0
bigger changes in diet and lifestyle can do even more			1
in another of study of 30,000 men and women in 52 countries in all seven continents , lifestyle factors accounted for almost all of the risk of heart attacks in both sexes and in all ages			2
think about it : heart disease and type 2 diabetes , two of the biggest killers in the @entity46 , are completely preventable by making comprehensive lifestyle changes			2
in addition to preventing chronic diseases , comprehensive lifestyle changes can often reverse their progression			1
my colleagues and i first proved that lifestyle changes alone can reverse even severe heart disease			2
we also found that the same program of comprehensive lifestyle changes can reverse type 2 diabetes and may slow , stop , or even reverse the progression of early - stage prostate cancer			2
@entity0 special report : ' @entity106 ' when comprehensive lifestyle changes are offered as treatment ( not just as prevention ) , significant cost savings occur in the first year because the biological mechanisms that control our health and well - being are so dynamic			1
for example , @entity113 found that overall health care costs were reduced by 50 % in the first year when people with heart disease or risk factors went through our lifestyle program in 24 hospitals and clinics in @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
in another study , @entity125 found that it saved $ 30,000 per patient in the first year for those who went through our lifestyle program			2
at a time when the power of comprehensive lifestyle changes to prevent and reverse chronic diseases is becoming better documented , the limitations and costs of high - tech medicine are becoming increasingly clear : -- recent studies have shown that angioplasties and stents do not prolong life or prevent heart attacks in stable patients , costing $ 60 billion per year			1
-- type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes will affect half of @entity46 in the next eight years at a projected cost of $ 3.3 trillion			2
lowering blood sugar with drugs does not fully prevent the economic and human costs of diabetes ( including heart attacks , strokes , amputations , impotence , kidney failure , and blindness ) , but lowering blood sugar with diet and lifestyle prevents all of these human and economic costs			1
-- only 1 out of 49 men treated for prostate cancer lives longer because of the surgery or radiation treatments ; the other 48 often become impotent , incontinent , or both			0
because of this , the @entity165 recently recommended that men not even be screened for prostate cancer , since there is such pressure to undergo treatments that , for most men , do not benefit them but may cause them harm in the most personal ways			0
but intensive lifestyle changes can be an alternative solution			2
changing your lifestyle can change your genes			2
it turns on genes that keep you healthy , and turns off genes that promote heart disease , prostate cancer , breast cancer , and diabetes			0
people often tell me , " oh , it 's all in my genes , there 's not much i can do about it			0
" knowing that changing lifestyle changes our genes is often very motivating -- not to blame but instead empower ourselves			0
on march 16 , tune in to @entity0 at 8 p.m. or 11 p.m. et to watch the extraordinary documentary film " @entity106 : the fight to @entity200 , " which vividly highlights what 's broken about our health - care system and what can be done to help rescue it			1
our work about the power of lifestyle changes is featured in two segments in the second half of the film			1
if you 're a doctor , you can even receive continuing medical education credit by watching it			0
@entity5 is now covering " dr. @entity216 for @entity218 " after 16 years of review			0
why ? because these are human issues that affect all of us and transcend our polarized political process , enabling us to find common ground			0
for @entity4 , this approach appeals to their core values of empowering the individual and taking personal responsibility			0
for @entity231 , it appeals to their core values of making better health care available to more people at lower costs			1
it 's a win - win situation			0
and the only side - effects are good ones			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			1

@entity241 : health care costs are out of control , let 's try to deal with the real causes
@entity241 : lifestyle choices make a huge *difference* in reducing diseases and illnesses
he says when lifestyle changes are offered as treatment , significant cost savings occur
