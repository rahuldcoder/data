@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is facing its most serious political crisis in years , with rapidly escalating conflicts between the civilian government , the military and the judiciary , against the backdrop of a faltering economy , widespread poverty , corruption and the bloody war with @entity14 militant groups			1
the country was founded in 1947 as a democracy , but in times of crisis the army -- @entity1 's most powerful institution -- has overthrown the civilian government on the grounds that the leadership had been unfit and corrupt			1
rumors of another coup have been swirling around the current crisis -- but analysts say a military takeover is highly unlikely this time around			1
here are five reasons why : 1			0
the people wo n't support a military take over @entity1 support a strong military for defense and security - related issues , but analysts say a history of failed military dictators has sapped much of the public 's confidence in the army 's ability to solve @entity1 's political problems			1
the reigns of military leaders like generals @entity45 , @entity46 , and , most recently , @entity47 , were plagued by accusations of corruption and ineffective leadership			2
" it has become far more difficult for a military takeover to take place because of public opinion , " says @entity51 , the head of @entity1 's @entity52 , an @entity0 - based political think thank			1
" there is a strong consensus against a military takeover among the @entity1 people			2
right now , all the public criticism is aimed at the civilian government			0
if the military takes over , the criticism will be directed at the military and that 's something they do n't want			0
" retired army @entity71 @entity70 says the @entity1 people are fed up with current civilian leadership , but they do n't think the army is the answer			2
" they do n't want to go back to an old system that has never worked , " he says			0
a vibrant @entity1 news media is watching one of @entity1 's internationally less - known features is its fiery and remarkably free news media that acts as this fragile democracy 's watchdog			1
a free press is only a decade - old concept in @entity1 but it has already emerged as a powerful player in @entity1 politics			2
at most hours of the day , @entity1 can watch any one of dozens of 24 - hour news networks , analyze the current political situation with reporters who hound politicians and catch up with newscasts that feature screaming debates and gaudy visual effects designed to make viewers stop and watch			2
it 's not all positive news : six journalists were killed in 2006 , according to the @entity99			0
meanwhile the activist group @entity100 calls @entity1 one of the most dangerous places for journalists , with news personnel often being intimidated in the course of their work			0
still , analysts say , the army will be answerable to the media in case of a coup			1
" the media is a big factor , " says @entity51			0
" we have already seen how the media is strongly questioning some of the actions taken by the military			0
if the military stages a coup there will be far more criticism from the media than any time in the past			2
an independent judiciary is watching in previous coups , @entity1 's military leaders have managed to strong - arm @entity1 's judiciary into supporting army takeovers			1
analysts say @entity1 's current judiciary -- led by a chief justice who was suspended in 2007 by @entity47 but later reinstated -- wo n't back down from a confrontation with the army			1
" the @entity135 used to lend legitimacy to such efforts by the military , but that 's no longer available to the army , " @entity51 tells @entity2			0
@entity1 's allies wo n't support a coup foreign powers , like the @entity144 and @entity145 , hold considerable influence over @entity1 because of economic , political and military support			1
that 's in spite of high tensions between the @entity144 and @entity1 in recent months , following the @entity144 raid into @entity1 in may 2011 that killed osama bin laden			0
still , analysts say , @entity1 's allies would view a military coup as destabilizing to the region and threatening to the fragile peace process in @entity157			1
" the @entity144 is watching and they do n't want a military takeover in @entity1 , " says @entity45			2
" i think they 'll step in to do all they can to convince the army a coup is not the answer			0
the army has better options than a coup much of the speculation about a possible coup stems from the perception that the army 's leadership does n't like @entity1 president @entity173 and wants him out			1
tensions between @entity173 and the army escalated after the @entity177 scandal -- an allegation that the government sent a secret memo to @entity181 calling for help to curb the military 's power , an accusation the government denies			0
analysts say that if the army wants @entity173 out , then there are safer and more practical options than a coup			1
the @entity135 is investigating @entity177 and pushing for the government to pursue old corruption charges against @entity173			0
a ruling against the president would leave him too isolated to hold on to power , analysts say			0
another option would be for the army to behave like the armed forces of a democracy by waiting for next year 's elections and letting the @entity1 people decide @entity173 's fate with their votes .			1

@entity1 founded as democracy in 1947 , but the military has *intervened* during crisis
nation suffers from faltering economy , widespread poverty , corruption , conflict with militants
analysts : vibrant media , independent judiciary may deter coup threat
the army also has better options than a coup , say *experts*
