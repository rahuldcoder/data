@entity0 are once again choking as smog levels hit " heavy or even worse " levels in the capital and a number of other cities across the country			1
persistent problems with city air have prompted officials and entrepreneurs to consider ways to protect their citizenry from the pollution			1
@entity0 was under an " orange " smog alert monday , which marks the first time the second - highest warning level of a new system introduced last year has been raised			1
the @entity19 ( @entity20 ) tuesday continued the alert for another 24 hours			2
capital measures come amid fog of pollution heavy smog routinely blankets the capital , all but blotting out the sun and forcing residents inside			1
@entity30 champion @entity29 revealed she 's had to train indoors in @entity0 due to the high levels of pollution , while smog across most of northern and eastern @entity34 has prompted officials to send teams of investigators to the worst - hit parts of the country			1
officials at the @entity41 cited " unfavorable meteorological conditions and firework and firecracker spree ( s ) " as the cause of the heavily polluted air			2
@entity34 's @entity48 celebrations , which took place earlier this month , are often accompanied by firework displays , and neighborhoods resound with the sound of firecrackers			0
the air pollution index recorded levels of over 400 , referring to the number of @entity57 -- harmful particulates measuring 2.5 microns or larger -- per cubic meter of air			1
the @entity60 recommends guideline values of 25 @entity57 in a 24 - hour period			0
the smog is expected to ease towards the end of the week			2
many are at least trying to tackle the matter themselves			0
from ubiquitous air filters in people 's homes to the near - mandatory facemasks that @entity0 wear outdoors on heavily - polluted days , personal health is a priority			1
given the restrictions in place on residents -- particularly the young and the elderly -- when the warnings go up , some more extreme measures have been taken			0
life under the dome the @entity81 has taken to shielding their young charges from the city 's air as the next logical step			2
at a cost of $ 5 million , the school has constructed two domes that enclose the entirety of its outdoor areas , allowing students to play and exercise year - round , regardless of how smoggy life is outside the enclosure			0
while it is a costly solution , other schools , alongside sports facilities and even wealthy individuals are placing orders			2
until the skies clear , life in the bubble seems surprisingly good			0
the world 's factory @entity34 's aggressive economic growth model means that heavy industrial activity also contributes heavily to the degradation of the air quality			2
as part of their anti-pollution measures , some factories surrounding the capital -- @entity114 is a huge steel - producing region -- have been forced to close temporarily following the raising of the orange alert			1
earlier in the year , the ministry upgraded emission standards for various heavy industries and waste disposal processes , upgrading protocols that were in some cases legacies of original standards , set in the 1980s before the onset of much of @entity34 's present industrial capacity			0
problems , however , persist			0
the @entity127 and the @entity0 - based @entity128 released a report in early february which ranked the two cities towards the top of a list of the worst - polluted cities			1
@entity0 ranked second , just behind @entity134			1
blue - sky thinking ? in the face of growing social unease at worsening environmental conditions , authorities are committed to rectifying the problem , and @entity0 will allocate 760 billion yuan ( about 124.64 billion dollars ) to improve the city 's air quality by 2017 , mayor @entity136 said last month at a municipal @entity145 meeting			1
the figure includes incentives for clean factories , and the municipal government has also improved the case for electric vehicles ( @entity152 ) by granting subsidies and license plate lottery waivers to those buying @entity34 - made cars , while switching government fleets to electric			1
the country is one of the world 's largest producers of green energy technology , although much of it is exported at present			0
more ambitious fixes have been proposed , including more " meteorological support services " -- such as cloud seeding -- as well as a giant " vacuum cleaner " designed by a @entity170 artist , and skyscraper - mounted sprinklers			0
these solutions , their inventors promise , will either trap or wash the smog away			1
naked run a novel approach to highlighting the problem came on sunday as more than 300 runners , according to official news sources , took to @entity183 wearing no more than their underwear -- and in at least one instance a gas mask -- to join a " naked run " protesting the city 's poor air quality			2
the best defense is a good smog a silver lining to the smog - cloud might be the military advantage it offers			0
@entity34 military theorist rear admiral @entity196 told the @entity197 that smog could be a defense against " laser weapons " , given that heavy smog can impede or block the technology			0
" smog with @entity57 readings of 500 - 600 is virtually impenetrable to lasers			0
in clear weather , laser weapons have a range of 10 kilometers , but smog can reduce this to less than 1 kilometer , " he said , although later was forced to defend his remarks against accusations of naivety and advocating a reckless defense theory .			0

@entity0 experiences @entity218 smog alert for the first time
government and individuals put forward a variety of solutions to air pollution *crisis*
air pollution index scores of 400 far exceed recommended levels
@entity231 trump environment as factories shown to be leading contributors
