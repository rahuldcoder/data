swirling winds and heavy downpours probably did more than the massive @entity4 police presence to dampen @entity6 protests in @entity7 over the weekend			1
@entity9 predictions that a third intifada was about to erupt after the brief closure of the @entity12 -- known to @entity13 as the @entity12 -- came to nothing			2
but the weather could not sweep away the toxic atmosphere in the city			0
tension in @entity7 is perhaps at its greatest since the end of the second intifada , or @entity6 uprising , ten years ago -- stoked by a rash of what some call hate crimes and others acts of terror			1
regular -- almost daily -- outbreaks of stone - throwing by @entity6 teenagers are answered by tear gas and rubber bullets ; hundreds of minors have already had their first taste of jail			1
the city 's mayor , describing the violence as intolerable , has announced that surveillance balloons equipped with @entity41 cameras will be deployed above troublesome neighborhoods to prevent disturbances			0
the @entity4 cabinet is considering legislation that would introduce prison terms of up to 20 years for throwing stones			1
one of the most restive neighborhoods in @entity7 is @entity49 , a densely - packed area in the shadow of the @entity12 , where there is little work , a heavy police presence and a growing colony of @entity57 settlers , moving into properties bought from @entity6			1
@entity60 issue last month , a @entity6 from @entity49 drove his car into passengers getting off a tram in @entity7 , killing a baby and injuring several others , including a woman who died later			1
and last week , a 32 - year - old @entity6 shot and gravely wounded a right - wing rabbi , @entity69 , as he left a @entity7 conference called " the @entity57 people return to the @entity12			1
" @entity69 , now in a serious but stable condition in hospital , has long argued that the @entity57 must have a place of worship on the @entity12 , a touchstone issue for @entity77 who suspect a plan to expel them from the site , where the @entity80 is also situated			1
@entity69 's view is supported by some elected officials , including housing minister @entity83 and deputy speaker of the @entity85 ( and a member of prime minister @entity88 's @entity87 ) @entity89			2
@entity69 's assailant , @entity90 , who had spent more than a decade in prison , in part for crimes of violence , was shot dead by an @entity4 counter-terror unit hours later			1
hundreds of @entity6 attended @entity90 's funeral ; his father said that if @entity90 had shot @entity69 it was because " occupation equals resistance			1
" @entity4 authorities reacted to the attempted assassination of @entity103 by closing the @entity80 altogether for one day , then restricting access to men over 50 years of age and women , and putting thousands more police on the streets			1
the @entity110 described the closure -- the first in 14 years -- as a " declaration of war			0
" there were also harsh words from @entity116 , which remains the custodian of the @entity119 holy sites in @entity7 according to its peace treaty with @entity4			1
in such an environment acts of political violence can spark outsize responses and set off an uncontrollable chain of events			0
the killing of three @entity57 teenagers in the @entity127 back in may , which @entity4 said was the work of @entity130 , sparked a crisis that ultimately led to the @entity133 conflict			2
in july , the abduction and murder of a @entity6 teenager in @entity7 provoked serious rioting			1
three @entity4 are on trial for the killing			2
@entity89 said " the government 's weakness and incompetence in handling terrorism " were responsible for the attempt of @entity69 's life			2
early on sunday morning , with a police guard , @entity89 returned to the @entity12 in defiance of an appeal from @entity88 for @entity85 members to show responsibility and restraint			2
' most sensitive kilometer on @entity152 ' @entity88 is walking a fine line between supporting the existing right of @entity57 to visit ( but not pray at ) the @entity12 and preventing that right from sparking a broader crisis and renewed violence			0
in a statement sunday aimed as much at the likes of @entity89 as @entity6 leader @entity159 , he said the @entity12 complex is " the most sensitive kilometer on @entity152 , " and insisted the government would not change the status quo			1
" it is easy to start a religious fire but much more difficult to extinguish it , " @entity88 said			0
on that note he and @entity159 were in rare accord , the @entity6 president saying " assaults and provocations by fanatics will lead to grave consequences			0
" some commentators say @entity88 is politically vulnerable on this issue			0
the @entity4 right , and especially the @entity176 led by economy minister @entity177 , is growing in strength , according to opinion polls			0
@entity177 -- a member of the @entity4 cabinet -- argued for a tougher @entity133 campaign aimed at destroying @entity130 and is widely seen as @entity88 's principal challenger			0
he told the @entity183 last month that " the logic that the world will love us if we give up more land does n't work " and has pressed for more settlement construction			0
he also told @entity189 he supported the right of @entity57 to pray at the @entity12			0
by contrast , support for the centrist and leftist parties is dropping , while opposition to a two - state negotiated settlement is widespread			0
a poll this month for the @entity199 found that 75 % of the @entity4 jews oppose @entity4 's withdrawal from the @entity202 and the division of @entity7 , which would give the eastern half to the @entity6			1
the volatility in @entity7 has become the latest flashpoint in @entity4 - @entity6 relations			1
the peace process is moribund amid an absence of trust between the @entity4 government and the @entity110 ; much of @entity133 is in ruins following seven weeks of conflict there this summer in which more than 2,000 people were killed			0
the @entity217 has questioned @entity4 's " commitment to a peaceful negotiated settlement with the @entity6 " in the wake of renewed momentum in expanding @entity57 settlements in @entity13 @entity7			1
the @entity223 made a similar criticism			0
in such an atmosphere , it is hardly surprising that @entity228 efforts to promote dialogue have stumbled			0
writing in @entity231 , @entity230 says that if you invest real effort in the peace process -- as have president @entity235 and secretary of state @entity236 " and you get precisely zero help from @entity88 and his lieutenants , a degree of irritation is to be expected			0
" " the @entity228 wants a two - state solution to the @entity4 - @entity6 conflict and a meaningful d√©tente with @entity245 , the @entity88 government opposes both , " he added			1
the left - leaning @entity4 newspaper @entity246 published a cartoon showing a grinning @entity88 piloting an @entity4 plane whizzing toward a @entity228 skyscraper			2
responding to a furious reaction in social media , cartoonist @entity250 said : " the message is that @entity88 is arrogantly and wantonly destroying @entity4 's ties with the @entity228 " from the other end of the political spectrum , journalist @entity255 wrote : " while [ @entity258 himself is responsible for the hit on [ @entity261 ] @entity103 , he has had one major enabler -- the @entity235 administration			2
" a @entity265 poll at the weekend found that 53 % of @entity4 jews now regarded the @entity228 administration as @entity268 , with just 16 % seeing it as @entity269			0
responding to disparaging remarks made about him by unidentified @entity228 officials last week , @entity88 sought to turn the criticism to his advantage , saying " the assault on me comes only because i defend the state of @entity4			0
" but that does n't include changing the delicate status quo on the @entity12 and inviting yet more violence at the end of a year already full of bloodshed .			2

regular outbreaks of stone - throwing by @entity6 teenagers answered by tear gas , rubber bullets
