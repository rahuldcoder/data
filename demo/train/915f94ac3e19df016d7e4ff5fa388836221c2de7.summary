-- @entity1 recorded a dramatic victory during a rain - affected @entity4 @entity3 to toast the 200th race of his @entity7 career in style			1
on an action packed afternoon the @entity11 @entity10 driver opted for the right set of tires to negotiate a late burst of rain , while teammate @entity17 , who led for long periods , toiled			1
a drive - through penalty put pay to @entity17 's hopes of winning as @entity1 crossed the line ahead of championship leader @entity23 in his @entity24 and @entity26 's @entity25			1
on the track where he won his first ever grand prix , @entity1 's victory was his second of the @entity7 season , though @entity23 heads for the mid season break with a lead in the drivers ' championship of 85 points			1
latest f1 standings after @entity4 @entity3 " it 's a great moment , all round a major weekend			1
for some reason i like these conditions			2
this is the first place where i won a grand prix , in 2006 , in these sorts of conditions , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" i 'm always lucky with these conditions			0
you are not always going to make the right call in these conditions but i feel i 'm pretty good at making the right call when it comes to tire choices -- but i 'm not the only one			0
" we had good pace today and i was able to make the soft tires last			0
the reason why we won today was because we were quick			0
if it did n't rain it would n't have made any difference			0
" on a wet track @entity23 soon relinquished the lead after running wide on a corner and @entity17 opened up a gap over the rest of the field as he successfully handled the first two pit stops			1
but on his third stop he opted for soft tires , with the track now dry in most places , while @entity1 followed the lead of @entity24 's @entity72 by taking on prime tires			1
the difference proved crucial 20 laps later as a shower heralded a return to the slippery conditions seen earlier in the race			0
@entity1 and @entity17 wrestled for the lead , and it changed hands several times before @entity17 returned to the pits to change to intermediate tires for more grip			1
and although @entity17 was ordered to observe a drive - through penalty for spinning in front of the @entity89 car of @entity90 , he used his fresh tires to good effect as he battled past @entity72 to finish the race in fourth place			2
" @entity1 was pushing me hard the whole race and the better man won today , " said @entity17			2
" i was struggling a lot with the graining on my left front tires			0
i do n't know whether that was my fault by pushing too hard			0
" @entity23 struggled with brake problems and slid off the track on several occasions but dug in to claim second and go into the mid-season break as the favorite to retain his world title			2
he said : " it was more important to bring the car home but all in all it 's fair to say that @entity26 and @entity10 on race pace in the last couple of events have made a step forwards			1
" there was also drama for @entity119 as his @entity120 caught fire and exploded shortly after he left the pits			0
the @entity123 managed to leap out of his car unharmed .			0
