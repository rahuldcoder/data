@entity0 -- @entity2 casts a long shadow			1
no one knows that better than his grandson , @entity7 , who is speaking out for the first time about growing up under , what he calls , a " family curse " started by @entity2 and his so - called " @entity2			1
" " i 'm personally , i 'm coming out , " says the 6 - foot - 2 kickboxer and cage fighter			1
@entity7 , whose father killed himself in 1993 , is " coming out , " he says , because he wants the real @entity2 family to stop hiding from a name that still has the power to evoke fear			1
today , @entity7 wants to understand his roots and himself a bit better , two things denied him as a child			1
he knew from a young age that @entity2 was his grandfather , but it never registered till one day in eighth - grade history class , said @entity7			1
our teacher " ... was talking about @entity2 and i 'm looking around like , are there people staring at me ? " forbidden from talking about @entity2 to his school friends lest they tease and taunt him , @entity7 always felt different from the other kids			1
even behind closed doors and with his own family , talk about @entity2 was discouraged			1
he was not permitted to ask his grandmother , @entity31 , about @entity2 , the man she married in 1955			1
it was a ghostly elephant roaming through his life			0
more than anything , @entity7 wants to connect with the father he knew only through an occasional letter or gift			1
he believes his father , who changed his name to @entity40 , purposely stayed away from him , not wanting to tarnish his childhood in the same way his had been			0
" he just could n't let it go , " reckons @entity7			1
" he could n't live it down			0
he could n't live down who his father was			0
" death on a desolate highway @entity40 , who was cursed with the name @entity2 , killed himself on june 29 , 1993 , on a desolate section of highway in @entity51 , @entity52 , just west of the @entity54 state line			1
the death certificate offers few clues as to why there and what finally pushed him over the edge			0
the document indicates it was about 10:15 a.m. when he died from a " self inflicted gunshot wound to the head " at " exit 438 on interstate 70			0
" @entity7 , who wrestles , fights and suffers the pain of tattoos in his off - time , makes a living working on oil rigs in western @entity72			1
he is a classically tough guy			0
but when it comes to the father he never met and when he thinks of what he went through as a child , he tears up			0
when asked what he 'd like his father to know , @entity7 gets emotional and , fighting back tears , he whispers , " i want him to know ... he missed out on a lot			2
" specifically , he wishes his father were there to enjoy his grandchildren and see the life he has built for himself			0
" i see my kids , you know , and that 's kinda where i get shook up , " he says the tears rolling			0
" i would hate to see them grow up without a father			0
" @entity7 wishes he could reverse time and tell his father on the stretch of @entity92 back in june of 1993 that whatever he was feeling at the moment would pass and a better life lay ahead			1
another @entity2 offspring , another search the desire to know one 's father and to understand oneself is the same force , the same primal instinct , driving @entity104 , a 44 - year - old @entity105 musician			1
@entity104 , who was adopted as an infant , sought out his birth parents in 1998			2
through an adoption agency , he found his birth mother ; according to @entity104 , she was a reclusive and psychologically troubled woman named @entity110 living in @entity111			2
as they got to know each other , @entity110 eventually dropped a small bomb on @entity104 that set him on a 14 - year search for his father			2
@entity110 told him that @entity2 was his father and that she had met @entity2 in @entity118 in 1967 at an orgy			1
he was one of four men there , and she was certain @entity2 had impregnated her			1
@entity104 did n't believe her except that he looked shockingly similar to @entity2			1
he then wrote to @entity2 in prison , explaining the situation			2
to @entity127 's surprise , prisoner @entity124 wrote back			0
@entity2 , in his frantic style and chicken scratch penmanship , confirmed to @entity104 that he was at the 1967 orgy and remembered his mother , @entity104 said			1
he related stories that his mother had told him that only she , or his father , would know			0
what seemed like fantasy was fast becoming reality			0
@entity104 twice tried to get a dna match with genetic material from @entity2 , but the samples were contaminated			1
but says dr. @entity139 , chief science officer at @entity140 in @entity141 , @entity142 , there is another way to establish the family link			2
if @entity104 and @entity7 are related , they will have an exact copy of @entity2 's y chromosome			1
" the male line is easier to compare , " said @entity139 , " because the y chromosome stands out so strong			0
we can get a very good correlation if the two are related			0
so curious were both men to once and for all solve the mystery , @entity1 took the extraordinary step to have both men 's dna taken and the results compared			2
same members of notorious family ? the men seem predisposed to being related			2
their lives run along parallel tracks			0
both are drawn to fame and fortune			0
@entity104 is lead singer of a band called @entity170			2
@entity7 is a fighter who goes by the name freebird			1
but both men have also had to settle for doing more conventional jobs to pay the bills			2
@entity7 has his oil rig job ; @entity104 is a dj at the @entity176 in @entity105 ' @entity177			1
both men have self - published their own books			0
@entity7 's " knocking out the @entity180 " and @entity104 ' " @entity181 " but the question remained : is @entity2 the common denominator in the lives of these two men ? it took @entity187 48 hours to resolve a mystery that @entity104 chased for 14 years			1
with both men in the same room , @entity139 told the men what they found			0
" we did a battery of dna tests			0
we studied your dna along several points , and we have concluded you do not share a common biological ancestry			0
" the news dropped on the room like a fact etched in lead			0
@entity7 exclaimed " holy cow			2
" @entity7 hoped to gain an uncle and perhaps a bit more insight into his family and his father 's life			1
@entity104 was visibly shaken as though he had just been robbed			2
" now there 's no chance of knowing who my father is , " said @entity104			2
" that 's the only lead i had , so now i have no chance of meeting or knowing my biological father			0
" most people would be overjoyed to discover that @entity2 was n't related to them , but @entity104 now feels his 14 - year search for a father has ended in a cul de sac , without definition and not sure where to go next			1
such is the power of wanting to know where we come from and trying to make sense of our present lives by knowing our past			0
for both men , the search continues			0
@entity1 's @entity231 contributed to this report .			0

two men grapple with same heavy burden -- they might both descend from @entity2
