@entity0 , @entity1 -- holding the @entity5 medal she and her mom always wanted , @entity3 finally smiled and talked about when she was a young skater and desperately wanted to make her mother proud			1
her mom , @entity8 , was her biggest supporter and sometimes her biggest critic , she said			0
she was n't the best " coach , " and she was kind of picky , but she had such a good eye , @entity3 said			1
she was always encouraging , too , even when she was finding fault			0
" and even though she 's not here anymore , i 'm not afraid to say it , sometimes she was a pain in the ass , " @entity3 said laughing , probably for the first time in days			1
@entity3 made her mom very proud thursday night , winning a bronze medal in the women 's figure skating final , just four days after @entity21 died of a heart attack			1
without her mother to support her , @entity3 skated into @entity24 's collective heart by relying on all those years of training , all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory			1
and when she needed it most , she relied on the memory of how her mom would always convince her that she was going to be on the @entity5 medals podium			0
" it feels good for me to talk about her , " she said , joyfully recounting the many times her mom took her to practice and stay when the other moms left			1
she laughed when she told how her mom would assess a school test score of 98 with a " what about those other two points ? " " she was my biggest fan , my best friend			2
she was with me every step of the way , " she said			0
when things were n't going so well in the first week @entity3 was here for @entity43 training , she called her mom , seeking her advice on what to do about her triple @entity46			1
her mom assured her it would be all right , that she just needed to visualize doing it well in her head , that this was something she had done for years			0
but doing what she did this week was something no person can ever be prepared for			0
to compete in the spotlight of the @entity43 ' marquee event , in front of an expectant and hopeful home crowd , with the heartache of her mother 's death so present would take strength most of us can not imagine			1
but the people closest to her knew she had that strength			0
her coach , @entity65 , said there was never any doubt that @entity3 would skate and never a doubt that she would n't be standing on the medals podium			1
" never ... because she was so ready and the goal was so strong , " @entity65 said , just like a proud mom			0
" i 've been with her since she was 12 so we just have to look into each other 's eyes and we know right away			2
it was really hard on her because her mom was the biggest thing in her life , but she 's not a quitter			2
" @entity3 said she struggled more than she showed during tuesday night 's short program that captivated the skating world			1
when she stepped on the ice , her legs were shaking , she said			0
with mom in ' heart and soul , ' @entity3 goes for medal " i do n't know how i ever got through this whole program			1
i 'm sure my mom was there with me , " she said			0
@entity3 was third after the short program -- 7.14 points behind @entity92 of @entity93 and 2.42 points behind @entity95 of @entity96 -- who skated just before her			1
the free skate scores are weighted more and account for roughly two - thirds of a skater 's total			1
@entity92 made it impossible for @entity3 to dream of gold with an amazing free skate that was the best ever under the 6 - year - old scoring system -- 150.06			1
the score was so high it would have beaten seven skaters ' combined marks on its own			2
her total of 228.56 is also a record			0
@entity95 then put up a 131.72 , virtually clinching silver			0
@entity3 came on the ice , looking determined , to the hockey - like cheers of the 14,000 at @entity114			1
she needed a perfect skate for silver but on a triple flip , she stumbled and her chance for second place slipped away			0
later in the program she had a bit of a shaky landing after another jump , but she stayed on her feet			0
after she finished she blew a kiss into the air , and came to the waiting area where she , in @entity128 , covered her heart with her right hand and spoke to her mother			2
@entity3 opted to stay in the games , and two days later stirred a crowd with a courageous performance			1
" her mother is inside her heart and soul , so she 'll be there for her , " her agent @entity138 told @entity2 on wednesday , " and [ @entity3 ] will draw from that strength			1
" @entity21 herself wrote of the bond she had with her daughter in an e-mail interview with the @entity145 in january			0
she said that she was the first person her daughter called whenever a problem occurred , though @entity3 did n't need a great amount of support , the @entity145 reported this week			2
" the hurdles she faces motivate her to rise above them , " @entity21 wrote to the monitor			0
" @entity3 has always been naturally determined and persevering			2
" @entity3 rose through the ranks of @entity24 skaters , winning junior national titles before winning six straight senior national championships from 2005 to 2010			2
in 2006 , she placed fifth at the @entity43 in @entity157 , @entity158 , and last year she finished second at the @entity159 in @entity160 , @entity161			0
@entity162 was the last skater to medal for @entity24 , earning silver at the 1988 @entity166 .			0
