-- the world of " @entity2 " is brutal			1
there are enemies and alliances , death and destruction			1
gamers fight for territory , profit and fame in a never - ending quest to top their opponent			2
it 's a bit like the real world that way			2
when @entity18 first created his " @entity2 " character , @entity20 , the two had little in common			1
@entity20 was a retired colonel from the @entity22 tribes -- a stoic , physically imposing disciplinarian			1
@entity18 was a 230 - pound @entity23 with an affinity for bacon			1
over time , the line between fiction and reality has blurred			2
" i 'm a role player inherently , " @entity18 says			1
" i take it seriously			2
" for @entity18 , @entity20 is a brand			1
the 40 - year - old advertising director has a blog called @entity20 's ramblings that he writes for daily -- as @entity20			1
he also creates music albums and @entity36 artwork			1
he even sells @entity38 - related paraphernalia to his fans through the blog and social media sites			2
brand loyalty is one of the reasons @entity18 first decided to shape up			1
during his trip to the 2009 " @entity2 " fanfest , real life hit him smack in the face			2
walking into the convention , he did n't feel like @entity50			2
he felt like a stereotypical geek , surrounded by other stereotypical geeks			2
" we were all just a bunch of pathetic losers , " @entity18 remembers			1
" we paid good money to fly all the way to @entity58 and instead of enjoying @entity58 , most of us spent all our time sitting around playing the video game we already played back home			2
" " something snapped inside me , and i realized i was n't being true to my brand			2
why ca n't i be this character ? why ca n't i look like this ? he acts and talks like me because he is me			1
i 'm the one who gave him life			2
" why gamers are a great fit at the gym for years , @entity18 's wife , @entity75 , had been bugging him to go the gym			1
when he returned from @entity58 , the pair joined on a trial basis			2
the first month was hard , @entity18 says -- his knees hurt , his feet hurt and he could barely run a mile			1
but he kept at it			2
he executed his fitness plan as seriously as @entity38 would execute a mission			0
he told himself his weight loss was a matter of life or death			0
" if i do not make these changes today , and every day going forward , i will die , " he says			0
" i know it sounds tragic but that 's what it took for me			0
" so he made the changes			0
he got up at 5:30 every morning			0
he did leg workouts that made him collapse			0
he pushed himself until he vomited			0
he did fitness programs like @entity97 and @entity98			0
he ran a half - marathon			0
@entity18 also changed the way he ate			1
@entity101 remembers a trip to visit friends in @entity104 when @entity18 created a grocery list for their hosts and made all his own meals			1
" it was almost embarrassing , " she says of the grocery list creation , " but you know what , i got over myself			0
because he 's on a path that i support			0
" @entity18 now eats 3,000 calories a day -- mostly lean protein and vegetables -- to sustain his body - building lifestyle			1
" five years ago if i was eating 3,000 calories a day , it was because i had bags of @entity123 in front of me , " he says with a laugh			0
he 's rigid about his lifestyle			0
he does n't eat dessert or allow for cheat days			0
it 's a struggle , but one he embraces as a sort of real - life challenge			0
" he always had this attitude of not giving up , but now it 's extreme , " @entity101 says			0
" he 's become very well - focused -- or stubborn -- with ( the ) journey he 's on			0
" his laser focus has paid off			0
@entity18 now weighs 185 pounds and is only 14 % body fat			1
he can squat almost twice his weight and dead - lift 450 pounds			1
" i 'm closer to looking like @entity20 than i 've ever been , " he says			1
@entity18 realizes he sounds slightly schizophrenic			1
but if you think about it , he says , all guys have fantasy lives			0
when they read comic books , they envision themselves as caped crusaders			0
when they watch @entity144 , they envision themselves as suave womanizers with oodles of money			0
" @entity149 , @entity150 -- we want to be them so badly , " @entity18 says			1
" the difference is you 'll never be @entity149			0
you 're setting yourself up to fail			0
" the reason @entity20 worked was that he was a fantasy hero of my creation , so i was already part way there			1
i just had to get the physical			0
" @entity101 says she keeps her husband from crossing the line between fantasy and reality			0
she 's not a big fan of @entity20 -- she prefers her men balanced , with a feminine side			1
when @entity18 slips into @entity20 's deep voice with a " hello , darling ... " greeting after work , " i 'm like ' oh , shut the hell up , ' " she says			1
" i have to remind him that it is a character			1
" still , @entity101 encourages him to blog and play " @entity2 " as much as possible because she knows his fans are eager for more advice on how to get fit			0
plus , there 's that other side benefit ... " if i said to him , ' this is affecting our relationship , ' i know he would ( stop ) , " @entity101 says			0
" but i do n't want to -- he looks yummy ! " ' @entity186 ' races to lose 100 pounds			1
