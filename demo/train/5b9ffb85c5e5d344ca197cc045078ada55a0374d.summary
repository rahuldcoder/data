the @entity0 tried to clarify remarks made by defense secretary @entity2 , when he told a @entity5 committtee on wednesday that the @entity7 military is seeking " permission " from a foreign organization to intervene in @entity10			1
" he was re-emphasizing the need for an international mandate			0
we are not ceding @entity7 decision - making authority to some foreign body , " a defense official told @entity15			1
in testimony to the @entity20 , @entity2 had an exchange with sen. @entity22 , @entity23 , who said @entity24 was circumvented when @entity25 decided to join the @entity27 coalition in @entity28			1
@entity22 said , " we spend our time worrying about the @entity30 , the @entity31 , @entity27 and too little time , in my opinion , worrying about the elected representatives of the @entity7			1
as you go forward , will you consult with the @entity24 ? " @entity2 replied , " you know , our goal would be to seek international permission			1
and we would come to the @entity24 and inform you and determine how best to approach this , whether or not we would want to get permission from the @entity24			1
" latching onto the words " permission " and " inform , " sessions ripped into @entity2 : " well i 'm troubled by that			1
i think it does weaken the ability of the @entity7 to lead			2
i do think ultimately you need the legal authority from the @entity7 , not from any other extra-territorial group that might assemble			1
" but even when sessions gave @entity2 a chance to clarify , @entity2 continued to say the @entity7 would seek " permission " so that there was a legal basis to act			1
" i 'm really baffled by the idea that somehow an international assembly provides a legal basis for the @entity7 military to be deployed in combat , " @entity22 said			1
" i do n't believe it 's close to being correct			0
they provide no legal authority			0
the only legal authority that 's required to deploy the @entity7 military is of the @entity24 and the president and the law and the @entity66			1
" after the exchange , committee chairman sen. @entity67 , @entity68 , tried to help @entity2 clarify further			1
" i do n't think the word permission is appropriate even in that context			0
by the way , i think what -- you really corrected it when you said a legal basis in international law would help you achieve an international coalition , " @entity67 said			2
" that 's correct , " @entity2 responded			2
after the hearing , @entity80 told @entity82 in an interview that @entity2 's comments were " very revealing of the mindset " of the administration			2
@entity2 " seemed so natural in expressing it as if he did n't understand this went against " the fundamentals of our government			2
while @entity22 said he does not think the @entity7 should act alone , he said there are indications that @entity10 president @entity94 is gaining momentum and " the window of opportunity could be closed			1
" " the delays that are taking place out of a determination to get a major worldwide support , i suppose could be costly , " @entity22 said in the interview			2
the defense official , who did not identify himself because he did not want to speak publicly for the secretary , further explained the rationale for seeking international agreement			0
" the legitimacy is greater if there is some form of international mandate			0
there 's a sense that unilateral @entity7 action would be perceived in the wrong way , especially in this part of the world			2
does the @entity7 want to go it alone in another @entity119 country ? that figures into the calculus			0
" the official said a @entity124 resolution , like the one that authorized action in @entity28 , is n't necessarily the only way to go about this			0
" some kind of mandate from a regional organization could signify this is not just a unilateral effort on our part , " he said			0
this is important not only to the @entity7 , but to other nations in the region that oppose @entity94 's regime , the source said			0
the official also emphasized that international agreement is just one of the concerns			0
the other part of the equation is the @entity10 military and dense population centers , which are big factors in any military intervention , said the source			0
" the complexity of that can not be overstated			0
this is a very hard problem set we 're dealing with			0
