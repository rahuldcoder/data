-- @entity3 - @entity2 posturing on @entity4 , with @entity5 arguing for more than limited strikes against the regime and @entity8 saying that whoever strikes president @entity10 must bear the consequences , serves as a harbinger for the birth of a new @entity15 order			1
just as @entity16 transformed the @entity15 by ending the @entity18 rule and creating contemporary nation states , so the @entity20 has recalibrated this regional system by ushering in a tri-axial @entity15 composed of : a @entity3 - @entity23 - @entity22 ( @entity25 ) axis ; an @entity2 - @entity26 axis ; and a @entity28 - pro - status quo monarchies axis			1
opinion : why limited @entity4 strike could hurt @entity3 in this fluid re-alignment , nation states will technically not disappear , but borders will increasingly be transcended by these axes as they contest regimes across the region in pursuit of installing their respective allies			2
forces representing @entity2 's aggrandizing foreign policy , @entity3 's @entity43 alignment and the @entity28 ' desire to keep the region 's remaining regimes in place will grind against each other , cutting across existing borders and churning tensions , stoking sectarianism in the name of achieving their realist motivations			1
opinion : @entity3 may be @entity57 's key to solving @entity4 crisis the novelty is not in the competition , but in the way this rivalry is playing out			2
in the @entity66 period , dominant @entity22 nations of the region -- @entity67 , @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity28 -- challenged each other by standing for different models of statecraft and often promoting opposing values			1
nevertheless , this competition did not usually turn acutely violent , with the exceptions of @entity74 , a weak state that was always exposed to regional and sectarian rivalries , and @entity77 , where the @entity28 and @entity2 took advantage of the post- 2003 vacuum to back warring @entity81 and @entity26 militia			1
the tumult of the @entity20 , however , has been a game - changer in expanding the scale and scope of these regional rivalries			1
firstly , the uprisings weakened the authoritarian states in the region , thus providing new venues for them to play out			0
the @entity4 civil war is a case in point			0
secondly , @entity67 's paralysis has taken it out of the four - way regional game			2
violent political polarization has transformed @entity67 from " the anchor of the @entity98 world " into yet another theater for regional competition among the three remaining @entity22 powers : @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity28			1
@entity3 , too , has changed			2
under the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) government , @entity5 has abandoned its @entity105 world view			0
once shunned as a hardline @entity107 party but recently rehabilitated , the @entity102 sees itself as a model forward for the @entity25 and has engaged regional mb parties to this end			0
@entity111 's @entity3 used to look at the @entity15 from the @entity112			1
the new @entity3 has embraced a new stance towards the region , looking at it from the @entity102 's @entity43 vantage point			2
is @entity4 plunging @entity15 into sectarian war ? the @entity102 elites believe that if they could moderate and come to power through democratic elections in @entity5 , like - minded @entity67 and @entity4 @entity118 should be able to do the same in @entity122 and @entity123			2
hence , @entity3 's dream : a region ruled by @entity25 parties , looking to @entity3 for guidance			0
this explains why @entity5 is aghast at @entity130 's response to the ouster of the government of @entity133 , issuing a very rare public rebuke of @entity130 that harshly blamed the @entity135 and the @entity112 for the bloodshed in @entity67			0
while @entity130 has accepted the @entity25 's ouster in @entity67 , pro-status quo forces in the region , including @entity138 , @entity28 , @entity139 , and @entity140 have actually supported military intervention against the mb. these monarchies abhor the tumult of the @entity20			1
the @entity28 dislike the idea of an @entity147 democracy led by the @entity25 , because they still see it as tumultuous and destabilizing			0
@entity149 : strange bedfellows -- @entity2 and @entity151 @entity2 meanwhile has taken advantage of the @entity20 to mobilize a contemporary @entity26 " mythomoteur			1
" @entity8 has cast the pro-democracy uprising against the @entity10 regime in @entity4 as a @entity81 uprising against minority @entity157 , an outlier sect of @entity26 , and then used this to play to the persecution syndrome of the region 's @entity26 , mobilizing them from @entity77 to @entity74 into @entity4 to rally behind the cause of propping up the @entity10 regime			0
@entity2 also supports the minority @entity26 rebels in @entity166 , who oppose a @entity28 - backed government there			1
at the same time , the @entity28 have cracked down on a pro-democracy uprising by @entity170 's majority @entity26			1
these moves have helped trigger sectarian chasms in the region , especially in the northern @entity174			0
this arch being home to three weak states , namely @entity74 , @entity4 , and @entity77 , is accordingly the prime theater for regional rivalries , whose borders are increasingly bleeding together			0
the @entity26 of the northern @entity174 are coalescing with each other and with @entity2 in ways not seen before in living memory			2
@entity0 poll : public against @entity4 strike resolution @entity3 , whose regime change policy in @entity4 has been undermined by @entity2 , has entered the @entity174 competition , throwing its support behind the @entity4 and @entity77 mb parties			2
this move has cast @entity5 and @entity123 as enemies , and also cooled ties between @entity5 and @entity196 , where the government is run by @entity26 that @entity3 considers @entity2 's peons			1
the @entity199 , wary of the emerging central government rule in @entity196 , have taken advantage of the situation and edged closer towards @entity5 , building on the nascent energy corridor already being developed between them			0
the @entity205 , too , are seeking @entity3 's protection			0
@entity3 's recent peace talks with the @entity208 ( @entity208 ) , which holds sway among not just @entity3 @entity205 but also @entity205 , will help this rapprochement			0
@entity4 civil war : not just about @entity4 at the same time though , @entity3 's @entity25 policy has been , for the time being , upended			0
the @entity22 has fallen from government in @entity67 , failed to elect its candidate to lead the @entity4 opposition , and has been sidelined in @entity217			0
@entity218 , which had hitherto allied itself with @entity5 to fund mb style parties , appears to be changing its heart after an unexpected change in leadership in @entity223			0
the tri-axial @entity15 includes tactical alliances			1
in @entity4 , for instance , although @entity3 and the @entity28 support different camps in the opposition , they are , nevertheless , united against @entity2			1
at the same time , @entity5 and @entity229 challenge each other in @entity67 where @entity3 stands with @entity133 's @entity22 party and the @entity28 with @entity233 's government			1
@entity234 : why the @entity15 is a mess this leaves a tri-axial @entity15 , in which @entity3 , @entity2 and @entity28 oppose each other in shifting alliances , vying to set a new regional order			1
moving forward , it is unclear whether @entity229 will continue to use its financial and political leverage amongst @entity81 regimes , particularly monarchies , to sustain its status quo posture			1
for @entity2 , @entity4 is the linchpin of its effort to extend beyond @entity26 - governed @entity77 , and will determine whether it can be a broader strategic hegemon or remain relatively contained			1
and non-arab @entity3 , by standing for just the @entity25 anywhere in the region , will see its influence wax and wane as each national revolution unfolds , though @entity5 's clout among the @entity205 may be more permanent			0
the @entity135 has squandered the @entity20 by not siding with liberal democracy , an agenda promoted by none of the three regional powers			2
citizens across the region have once again returned to chanting anti- @entity135 slogans to explain their tumult and plight			0
moving forward , @entity130 must navigate the new @entity15			0
otherwise , the region 's political and ideological map will be redrawn by more influential anchor states			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 and @entity267 .			2

@entity267 and @entity266 say the @entity20 has recalibrated the regional system by ushering in a tri-axial @entity15 :
a @entity3 - @entity23 - @entity22 axis ; an @entity2 - @entity26 axis ; a @entity28 - pro - status quo monarchies axis
@entity2 has taken advantage of the @entity20 to mobilize a contemporary @entity26 " mythomoteur , " they write
