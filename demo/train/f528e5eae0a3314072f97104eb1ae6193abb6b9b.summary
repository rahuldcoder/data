@entity6 the tragic shootings in each of these and other towns have ignited public sentiment for some kind of gun reforms and fired up gun advocates to protect what they see as their constitutional right of easy access to firearms			1
according to recent polls , more than 90 % of @entity18 favor some form of background checks for firearm purchases , particularly at gun shows , but the efficacy of the measure remains dubious by both law enforcement and gun control advocates			1
but , as @entity28 wrestles with what new measures -- if any -- should be passed to control gun purchases , one question looms : in those and other mass shootings , would background checks have made any difference ? how background checks work looking back , background checks did not stop three mass shootings that claimed more than 40 lives since 2011			1
in the massacre in @entity2 , @entity44 , where 26 people , mostly children , were gunned down at @entity2 , @entity42 used two semi-automatic handguns and a semi-automatic rifle			0
he did n't get a background check for those weapons			1
they were legally purchased and registered to his mother , @entity2 , who was his first victim			0
last july , @entity52 walked into a crowded theater in @entity3 , @entity54 , and began shooting			0
his @entity56 , two 9 mm @entity57 , .40 caliber pistol and 12 - guage shotgun were all purchased legally , after his name was submitted to the @entity62 ( @entity62 )			2
the same is true with @entity64 , who shot then - rep. @entity65 and 19 other people , killing six , in @entity5 in january 2011			2
his application was never flagged when run through @entity62 -- the database from which potential firearms buyers are determined legally eligible to purchase a gun			2
@entity71 ' plucks the bird ' to weaken gun proposals " the one shooter that might have been prevented by background checks and was not was the @entity6 shooter because he had , in fact , been adjudicated to be potentially violent , " said @entity71 president @entity74			1
@entity80 , who killed 32 people in 2007 on the picturesque @entity82 in @entity83 , had been deemed mentally ill by a judge , which is one of the criteria used to disqualify certain people trying to buy a gun			0
others who could be potentially disqualified include convicted felons , fugitives , drug addicts and domestic abusers			0
@entity80 's case apparently slipped through the cracks and the state of @entity82 has since instituted a series of reforms in its reporting procedures to @entity62 as a result			0
@entity80 might have been stopped if universal checks were the law , vice president @entity102 said			2
" one of the problems that was pointed out here was that there was an adjudication of the young man that committed the crime at @entity6 , and yet he was able to go out and purchase two weapons , " @entity102 said in january			2
the current @entity114 proposed bill called the " @entity119 " seeks to remedy the database deficiencies by forcing the states to become more involved in submitting names into the existing system			0
the sticking point with the proposal for many anti-gun control proponents is the requirement that background checks cover every firearm sold , whether at gun shows , the @entity127 or private sales			1
sens. @entity129 , @entity82 , and @entity130 , @entity131 , announced wednesday a bipartisan deal on background checks for gun shows and internet sales , but a similar agreement in the @entity137 is still unlikely			1
sen. @entity138 , @entity140 - @entity139 , who wrote the latest @entity114 bill , said his was an expansion of the 1994 @entity143 that banned military - style assault weapons for a decade before it expired			0
" every major expert believes that universal background checks will save lots of lives , " @entity138 told @entity1			1
he added that 1.7 million people " have gone to firearms dealers and been denied guns because they were felons or adjudicated mentally ill because of the @entity143 law			0
" but the @entity71 's @entity74 disagreed			0
" the tipping point for all this gun control talk about background checks is actually an example of how background checks do n't matter ... [ the ] killer will find a way to get a gun even if he kills the owner			1

mass shootings have ignited public sentiment for some kind of new gun control
examples of gunmen in recent mass shootings suggest background checks not a *panacea* .
the @entity6 case is one where a background check might have made a difference
gun rights advocates oppose universal checks , any new record - keeping requirement
