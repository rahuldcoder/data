-- a @entity3 rocket slated for launch sometime early next month can be clearly seen in a satellite photograph taken sunday , the @entity1 said sunday			1
the latest satellite image shows a rocket sitting on its launch pad in the north east of the country			2
the satellite imagery , obtained by the @entity1 from @entity12 , is said to show the rocket at the @entity15 launch site in northeastern @entity3			1
the image casts a shadow on the ground below			0
@entity0 could not independently confirm the information provided by the institute , led by former @entity23 nuclear inspector @entity21			0
@entity25 officials were not immediately available for comment			0
@entity28 defense secretary @entity27 said sunday there is little doubt that the planned launch is designed to bolster that @entity3 's military capability			1
he also indicated that the @entity28 military could be prepared to shoot down a @entity3 missile if the rogue regime develops the capability to reach @entity37 or the western continental @entity28 in a future launch			1
the @entity3 government says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket sometime between april 4 and april 8			1
" i do n't know anyone at a senior level in the @entity28 government who does not believe this technology is intended as a mask for the development of an intercontinental ballistic missile , " @entity27 said during an appearance on " @entity43			2
" @entity27 noted that while the @entity28 believes it is @entity3 's " long - term intent " to add a nuclear warhead to any such missile , he " personally would be skeptical that they have the ability right now to do that			1
" @entity59 recently mobilized its missile defense system -- an unprecedented step -- in response to the planned @entity3 launch , @entity59 officials said			1
the move , noteworthy for a country with a pacifist constitution , is aimed at shooting down any debris from the launch that might fall into @entity59 territory			0
in a concurrent response , @entity71 ships capable of shooting down ballistic missiles are being moved to the @entity75 , a @entity71 spokesman said thursday			1
@entity27 said that the @entity28 military could shoot down " an aberrant missile , one that was headed for @entity37 ... or something like that , we might consider it , but i do n't think we have any plans to ( do ) anything like that at this point			2
" he does not believe @entity3 currently has the technology to reach @entity84 or @entity85			0
@entity27 said that impending missile launch is a clear demonstration of the failure of the recent six - party talks to disarm the @entity3 regime			2
" it 's very troubling			0
the reality is that the six - party talks really have not made any headway any time recently , " he said			0
" if ( the missile launch ) is @entity96 's welcoming present to a new president ... it says a lot about the imperviousness of this regime in @entity3 to any kind of diplomatic overtures			0
" @entity27 said that he believes economic sanctions are the best tool to getting countries like @entity3 and @entity106 to the negotiating table			2
both countries are believed by the @entity28 and other @entity110 nations to be trying to acquire a nuclear capability .			0
