her paintings may sell for thousands of dollars , but she is best known for a modeling shot 50 years ago that helped launch a money - spinning business empire			1
now 72 , but looking a decade younger , @entity4 was the first @entity6 swimsuit issue cover star			1
discovered on a beach in @entity8 , these days she resides in a mountain town far from the glamor and glitz of the entertainment industry that has made household names of her successors			0
it all started on a whim -- for her a chance of some @entity20 sunshine ; for @entity6 a chance , for one week , to fill the void left by a lack of content in the winter months			1
today , the swimsuit issue , launched half a century ago on january 20 , has outgrown the magazine that first spawned it			1
the 2012 edition generated more than $ 40 million in advertising revenue , 7 % of the weekly publication 's total for the entire year , not to mention the millions it makes in sales to the public			2
that issue had 34.5 million video views online , while a free mobile app had 500,000 downloads in the opening week alone			2
so it 's a very happy 50th birthday indeed for owner @entity40 the swimsuit issue is more than just scantily - clad women in bikinis gallivanting around the world 's most picturesque beaches -- it 's a business behemoth			1
supermodels such as @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 have featured on the cover , while sports stars including @entity54 and @entity55 have featured along with pop star @entity56			2
but leading the way was an aspiring young @entity58 , then living in @entity59 after spending several years in @entity60			1
known at the time as @entity4 , she had featured on the @entity63 catwalks and been a regular on the pages of @entity66 and @entity67			1
in november 1963 she received a call from @entity69 , a renowned glamor photographer with whom she had worked regularly			0
" there were about five or six photographers who seemed to like me , and that 's how things started for me really -- he was one of them , " she told @entity71			2
" we did a lot of pictures together and he worked for @entity6 on and off			1
he asked if i wanted to come on a trip to @entity20 and i thought , ' why not ? ' " it was n't the money -- as little as $ 50 a day for the 10 - day shoot -- that persuaded her , rather the lure of a trip to the sun - drenched island resort of @entity91			1
" it was a great trip -- so much fun , " she recalls			2
" there were n't any people there , not like now			0
you have to remember @entity101 ( on the mainland ) did n't really exist then , the only people there were the @entity103			0
and they seemed to enjoy the shoot ! " there was nothing about it being a cover shoot , it was just a shoot , something fun and something different			2
" each day , we 'd have breakfast and then the photographer would tell as where to go			2
he was just constantly snapping pictures			0
i was put in my bathing suit , and that was it			0
" when she and the rest of the team boarded the plane back to the @entity125 , their high spirits were shattered soon after touching down in @entity126 , @entity127			2
" when we landed , we were grounded and it was announced that president @entity130 had been shot dead , " @entity4 says			1
" the whole plan was just crushed			0
people were screaming and crying , it was awful			0
i 'll never forget that			0
the dream trip had ended on such a terribly sad note			2
" @entity4 quickly moved on to her next job -- she continued modeling until 1979 -- and gave very little thought to @entity6 , as did they to her			1
" that was the only time i ever worked for them , " she says			0
" i never heard from them again			0
" of course i had no idea i 'd be on the cover of the first issue ( which was merely a short supplement to the magazine ) and of course i had no idea it would become as big as it did			1
" but she made the cover : her head turned to the side , smiling cheekily in a white bikini as the @entity20 waters lapped against her ankles			1
even now , people still send her copies of the magazine asking for an autograph			0
" there are marriage proposals too , " says the married @entity4 , " and i 'm 72 , i tell you ! " it 's perhaps apt that her modeling career should have begun with her wearing a white bikini			1
as a 15 - year - old , she went to the beach in @entity167 , where she lived with her family at the time , wearing a white , tassled outfit -- which proved to be too risque for the time			0
" it was 1959 and i got asked to leave the beach because of what i was wearing , " she says			0
" but also on the beach was a photographer for @entity174 , and he basically discovered me			0
my first job was outside a camera shop for $ 25			0
i still think i 've got the check for it somewhere			0
i then started modeling properly in @entity59 in 1961			0
" @entity4 , and her husband @entity180 , live nowhere near the beach these days			1
they relocated from @entity183 to @entity184 , a small town of 350 people in @entity187 , where he works as a sculptor and she paints			1
art has been a big part of her life , from self - portraits to the nature landscapes and home interiors that hang from the walls of her home gallery -- which sell for $ 7,000 each			0
and when not painting , she loves nothing more than hiking with her dogs in the surrounding , undulating terrain , where it 's not uncommon to see coyote , deer , antelope and elk			1
" painting 's always been a big part of my life and where i live is the perfect setting for inspiration , " she says			1
" for me , personally i love the bright colors			0
" while in @entity187 , she is known as @entity4			1
to the rest of the world , she is the first cover star of one of the world 's most celebrated magazines .			2
