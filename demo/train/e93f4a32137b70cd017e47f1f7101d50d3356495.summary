-- this week @entity2 and world powers finally commence long - delayed nuclear negotiations in @entity4			1
was it a coincidence that just a few days ago , @entity7 and @entity2 president @entity8 engaged in a monumental 15 - minute phone call and reopened a line of communication that has been closed for more than thirty years ? it 's clear that @entity2 's new president hopes to establish trust between the @entity15 and @entity2 so that sanctions on @entity2 's economy are removed			2
in return @entity8 , who says @entity2 has no intention of developing nuclear weapons , promises to offer complete transparency into the country 's uranium enrichment program			1
securing this trust between both @entity2 and the @entity25 , however , will be no easy feat. decades of political antagonism -- along with @entity2 's @entity28 and the @entity29 -- stand in the way of a successfully negotiated outcome			1
@entity2 and the @entity25 have a number of areas of mutual interest : stability in @entity36 , peace and security in @entity39 , and the resolution of the conflict in @entity42			1
@entity2 has control and influence over the region via its affairs with and support of @entity48 in @entity49 and @entity42			0
all of these difficulties are compounded by the nuclear issue			0
but the resolution of the crisis through a grand bargain would in fact benefit not only the @entity25 , but also its allies in the region			0
and although the thought of a compromise with @entity2 concerns @entity61 , @entity62 , and the emiratis of the region , that does n't mean all is lost			2
analysis : @entity25 hopeful , " clear - eyed " over talks the stringent sanctions on trade with the @entity25 and @entity69 have seen @entity2 gradually shift its oil and gas trade toward @entity71 -- namely @entity72 and @entity73			1
but @entity2 's exclusion from the @entity76 currency clearing system has forced @entity77 to deal in local currencies			1
when @entity2 trades with @entity73 it receives rupees in exchange for its oil			0
@entity2 then uses the rupees to buy @entity73 products , but it has ended up selling more oil than it has made in imports , creating a trade imbalance			0
relaxation on sanctions on these trading partners will be easier to implement			0
while sanctions related to medical necessities have already been relaxed , and discussions about freer trade in petrochemicals and the loosening of trade controls on gold have been mentioned , @entity2 will hardly perceive these steps as sufficient			0
in reality , in the short term , @entity2 needs to be granted access to fund transfers via @entity76			1
in the longer term , the @entity25 will be asked to ensure @entity2 has access to the proper technology required for efficient oil and gas production			1
projects â € ” such as the pipeline that supplies @entity2 oil to @entity110 and @entity73 , and thus benefits not only @entity2 but also @entity110 and @entity73 â € ” will need to be allowed to be implemented			0
in exchange for @entity25 help in removing some of the sanctions and in the opening up of exportation channels , @entity2 would need to agree to complete transparency and to the closure of some of its nuclear facilities			1
but the hurdles are many , and the most complicated and involved ones are with the @entity29			0
the @entity7 administration has limited control over the actions of the legislative branch , and voting against @entity2 may be more politically expedient for lawmakers on @entity127			0
this is one of the reasons why @entity130 , @entity2 's @entity131 , has said he believes @entity25 is not reliable and can not be trusted			1
opinion : how @entity77 got back to the negotiating table despite these difficulties , i believe there remains room to strike a deal			0
@entity2 may be willing to provide significant transparency , including extensive and thorough inspections of all nuclear operations , a reduction in the amount of nuclear material produced and stored in @entity2 , and even the dismantling of a few thousand centrifuges			2
but @entity2 will be reluctant to relinquish its 20 % - enriched uranium , which experts believe can easily be weaponized , unless the @entity15 is willing to provide similar material for use in @entity2 research facilities			0
for its part the @entity152 -- the @entity25 , @entity154 , @entity72 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 -- would need to make trade with @entity2 less burdensome by allowing a specified set of @entity2 banks access to currency clearing via @entity76			1
the @entity25 and its partners would also need to remove a number of sanctions to allow @entity2 to more freely trade its oil with its partners to the @entity167 and be paid for it in tradable currencies			2
if trust can be established and a bargain can be struck , the sheer size of @entity2 's population of 75 million could make it the largest economy to rejoin the global system since the collapse of the @entity179 economies			2
many @entity2 are well - educated and eager to participate in the global market , providing an ideal situation from which many future businesses could emerge			2
if it is perceived by the western world that @entity2 discussions with the @entity25 seem to be going well , the @entity25 will likely see enormous business pressure from others , including our @entity69 friends , to accelerate the process of reducing sanctions			2
despite the complex and often - conflicting interests of the negotiating parties , i believe at least a partial deal will be struck between @entity2 and the @entity15 -- an agreement that begins to bring @entity2 back into the international fold and provides steps to end 34 years of what has been a lose - lose situation for everyone involved			1
the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of @entity204 .			0

despite areas of mutual interest , securing trust between @entity2 and @entity25 wo n't be easy
@entity2 must be transparent over nuclear program ; @entity25 must allow @entity2 access to @entity76
@entity204 : a partial deal out of talks could bring @entity2 back into global fold
