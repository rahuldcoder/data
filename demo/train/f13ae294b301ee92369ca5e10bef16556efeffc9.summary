-- now , 45 years later , i still see it			1
among the most exhilarating moments of my life was when i touched the fingertips of @entity7			1
that 's ultimately where i 'm going			1
until then , let 's discuss the months , weeks and days before everything stood still for a 12 - year - old that bright thursday afternoon on a mostly empty street in northern @entity13			1
this journey of fate began in a classroom of politically astute sixth - graders at @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity13			1
it was the spring of 1968 , when turmoil was everywhere , and it was just the start of horrors to come for what would rank among the most violent years in @entity25 history			2
just like that , courtesy of the @entity28 in late january and early february , the @entity26 went from winding down to raging out of control			2
there were nerve gas leaks in @entity33			2
there was the @entity35 in @entity36 , where state police killed three college students protesting a segregated bowling alley			2
then there was our discussion in a back corner of that classroom involving a small gathering of sixth - graders on who deserved the @entity49 nomination that year for the presidency of the @entity25			2
it was a discussion that had nothing to do with the scheduled agenda of our teacher , mr. @entity54 , and it was a discussion that came out of nowhere			2
what about @entity57 who could n't solve @entity58 , but who had done more with @entity60 than any president since @entity62 ? three years earlier , in mrs. @entity65 's third - grade class , she ushered us to the window to see @entity57 's helicopter fly by in the distance en route to landing in town to kickoff his " @entity73 " program			1
for those who despised war , @entity75 sen. @entity74 made sense			1
he even caused @entity57 supporters to squirm in early march by finishing a tight second to the sitting president in the @entity83 primary			2
one more name ... @entity7			1
he actually spurred the conversation			2
he was charismatic , and he was highly sympathetic to the black community of which i was a part			2
not only that , he was a @entity7 , which was as magical a name then as it is now			1
on march 16 , a few days before our discussion , he did what many thought he would do earlier : he declared he was running for the @entity96 that once belonged to @entity97 , his brother who was assassinated five years earlier			2
during @entity97 's administration , @entity7 was the ruthless attorney general who doubled as the confidant of the president			1
in 1968 , his edges became softer , partly because of his ongoing grief , but mostly because of his sense of mission			2
he was a 42 - year - old senator from @entity105 who was obsessed with helping the poor , and he was an outspoken champion of racial and social justice			2
the difference was that @entity74 was n't a @entity7			1
neither was @entity57 nor @entity110 , @entity57 's vice president , who later ran for president after @entity57 shocked the universe by abruptly dropping from the race at the end of march			1
consider , too , our discussion involved white and black kids			2
in fact , most @entity19 schools were racially mixed , and such was the case even when my parents moved through the school system during the 1940s and 1950s			2
@entity19 also was the definitive blue - collar town back then as the headquarters for @entity129 cars , @entity130 and the @entity131			0
plus , you had the free thinkers at the @entity134 within the city limits			0
@entity136 is the world 's most famous @entity137 university , and the @entity139 are catholic			1
despite their overwhelming wealth , @entity7 became the face of the @entity139 ' desire to help the less fortunate while promoting racial harmony			1
translated : @entity19 was made to hug @entity139			1
with that in mind , several days after our discussion in mr. @entity54 ' class , a wonderfully crazy thing happened			0
the principal announced over the intercom that school was finishing early that afternoon to give everybody a chance to stand on the curb in front of the building to see a passing motorcade -- @entity7 's motorcade			1
he had landed in town to begin his campaign for the @entity13 primary , which would be his first primary since announcing his candidacy			0
my birthday is in october , but it came early back then , along with @entity168 , @entity169 and the @entity170			0
@entity7 ? we were just talking about the guy			1
there were no cell phones during the spring of 1968			0
no opportunity to contact the parents , other relatives or friends to inform them about our pending dance with history -- and , yes , even then , we knew this would be something huge for the ages			0
so my crew of sixth - graders joined hundreds of others on the edge of @entity190 waiting			0
as 20 minutes became a half - hour , the crowd dwindled to half			0
by the time the wait reached an hour , it was clear @entity7 was @entity195			1
my brother , @entity197 , and i were in the same grade			0
we thought of waiting some more , but we decided to begin our usual half - mile walk home			0
we moved down @entity190 , looking over our shoulders along the way -- hoping , praying			0
the motorcade must have gone a different way to the @entity19 airport en route to wherever , or maybe @entity7 just left earlier than expected			1
once we got home , we were supposed to start our daily routine			0
off with the school clothes , then on to homework and house chores			0
then we could enjoy the great outdoors			0
school day after school day , we did that routine without fail , but this time , @entity197 talked me into altering things to take a quick spin around the block on our brand - new bikes			1
soon , we heard sirens			0
we glanced at each other with wide eyes , and without a word , we pedaled faster than a sunbeam toward @entity190 , which was a block or so in front of us			0
we jumped off our bikes with the banana seats and stingray handle bars , and after a group of @entity19 motorcycle cops passed by , a convertible headed our way with flashing lights			0
so we stood there , waiting , hoping , just the two of us , with nobody else in sight on the street			0
the convertible got closer , and the man sitting on its right side stood up with his light - colored hair waving in the wind as he gave a signal to the driver to slow down			1
with the car shifting into a lower gear , the man leaned over as much as he could without tumbling out of his car			0
it was @entity7 , alright , and as his convertible kept traveling toward its destination in slightly less than a hurry for that moment , he touched my brother 's fingertips and then mine			1
we watched the motorcade fade into the distance			0
then , after @entity197 and i looked at each other with even wider eyes , we unleashed the biggest " @entity267 " of joy ever known			0
that was in contrast to the sorrow we felt two months later after our mother shook us out of our beds in the middle of the night / morning of june 5			0
we rushed to the television in our parents ' room to see a heavy dose of live grief across the television screen			0
the man with that light - colored hair waving in the wind was gunned down in the kitchen of @entity285 in @entity286 , and this was after he moved closer that evening to the @entity49 nomination by winning the @entity290 primary			0
it was as if a family member had died			1
as the years became decades , i kept thinking : when did that happen ? then came last autumn , when i satisfied my curiosity			0
i was back in @entity19 for a @entity136 football game , so i dedicated an afternoon to searching old @entity299 newspaper editions at the public library			0
within the hour , i found a brilliantly written story of @entity7 's 1968 trip to northern @entity13 in the @entity299 's evening edition , and it mentioned how @entity7 was leaving @entity19 for @entity304			1
i touched @entity7 's fingertips a few hours before he gave one of the most passionate speeches ever			1
he urged a potentially angry crowd to stay calm			0
he preached the need for everybody in @entity304 to practice nonviolence , especially since he had experienced the suffering that comes from the gruesome death of a brother			1
it was april 4 , 1968 ... the day @entity318 was killed			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity321 .			1

@entity321 was 12 when @entity7 reached out and touched his fingertips
hours later on that day , @entity7 gave a passionate speech advocating nonviolence
@entity321 made a *sad* yet *fascinating* *discovery* upon looking up that speech 's date
@entity321 on @entity7 's *assasination* : " it was as if a family member had died "
