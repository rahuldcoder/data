-- animated television specials are among the most cherished holiday traditions of yuletide revelers young and old			1
mention " a @entity12 " ( 1965 ) , " @entity9 " ( 1964 ) or " @entity14 " ( 1969 ) and people light up like @entity5 's tree ( after the kids gave it a little love ) , @entity9 's nose , or the hot sun that melted poor @entity11			1
you can thank " @entity18 " -- the first animated @entity12 special -- for that holiday gooeyness			1
it premiered 50 years ago this month			1
" @entity18 " originally aired on december 18 , 1962 , on @entity21 at 7:30 p.m. for the first time since 1967 , the special will air on a major network -- once again on @entity21 -- saturday , december 22 at 8 p.m. et. while the major networks have aired the aforementioned holiday staples , including " @entity25 ! " ( 1966 ) every year since their airdates , " @entity28 " has n't aired outside of syndication for 44 years			1
now that " @entity18 " has hit he half - century mark , this often overlooked , underappreciated , somewhat obscure @entity12 special is experiencing a renaissance of sorts			1
@entity0 spoke to animator @entity34 , author of " @entity18 : the making of the @entity35 , " about how " @entity28 " paved the way for @entity12 specials yet to come			1
" because this was such a huge success , " said @entity34 , " it inspired other people to follow in its footsteps , especially ' @entity9 , ' which was the next one			1
" @entity34 could n't pinpoint why " @entity18 " fell by the wayside , but he did note that the character began to dwindle in the years following the @entity12 special			1
your @entity12 traditions " ' @entity49 ' had a book attached to it , " said @entity34 , " ' @entity5 ' had all of those books , all of those specials			1
these were constantly in the forefront of peoples ' minds during the holidays			2
and ' @entity9 , ' well , who does n't know that song ? between all of these other specials getting all of this promotion , and mr. @entity28 kind of fading , it really got lost for a long time			1
" as far as adaptations of @entity70 ' 1843 tale " @entity71 " go , many have tried , many have failed , and -- arguably -- a handful have succeeded			2
most people would count " @entity28 " among the successful renditions			1
" i think this is one of the stronger versions because it 's quite loyal to the original , " said @entity34			2
" they are reciting lines from the book , and on an emotional level i think it 's one of the strongest -- even over live - action -- because the songs really emphasize the emotional aspect of it			2
they know exactly where to go to tell their story			2
" that 's right -- " @entity18 ' is a musical as well as an animated special			1
" to take a classic story like that , " said @entity96 , " and then to mix in mr. @entity28 , and then make it a musical , it 's kind of a big leap			1
and he did n't just make it a musical ; he went after the best @entity105 songwriters of the time			2
it 's one of the stronger , if not the strongest , musical interpretations of @entity70			2
" composer july @entity109 and lyricist @entity110 , who were developing " @entity111 " at the time , wrote the songs for " @entity18 " while ensconced at the @entity113 in march and april of 1962			1
the @entity109 - @entity115 team created @entity105 - caliber songs like " @entity117 " and " @entity118 , " which gave " @entity18 " an emotional quality which made it more theater than the cartoon it was			1
@entity124 presented as a play - within - a - play , the special features the character of @entity28 starring in a @entity105 production of " @entity71			1
" that little technique solved the producers ' dilemma regarding whether or not audiences would buy @entity28 as @entity133			1
" @entity28 had kind of changed over the years , " explained @entity34			1
" he had started out as this crotchety old man and over the years he had become softer			0
[ producers ] thought it would be kind of weird to put this character in a role with no explanation			0
nowadays people do it routinely and you do n't think twice about it , but at the time it was a big leap			2
originally , mr. @entity28 was going to be in a small community theater production , but as the songs got bigger , they decided to make it a @entity105 production with him as a well - known actor			1
" although " @entity18 " was released on @entity149 / dvd as a special anniversary edition , @entity34 is the first to admit that the animation is n't what resonates with longtime fans of the special			1
" the animation fills the bill , but there is n't anything in the way of nice motion or defining the characters through the way they move , " said @entity34			0
" it 's all about simply hitting their marks to tell the story			0
it 's a little rough around the edges , but it works , too			0
the songs are so good that you overlook stuff like that			0
" @entity34 pointed out that the important thing is that the special " has a lot of heart			2
" in fact , the instant the special ended on the night it premiered , producer @entity177 's phone rang			2
@entity182 had phoned to tell @entity177 how wonderful it was			0
@entity34 wrote about the conversation in his book			0
" let me tell you something , @entity187 , " @entity182 told @entity177			0
" not only is this generation going to watch it , but your children , your children 's children and your children 's children 's children will watch this show			0
that 's how good it is			0
" @entity182 's stamp of approval was the ultimate gold star			0
" here 's this guy that practically invented animation as we know it , " @entity96 told @entity0 , " who takes the time out of his day to watch it and call this guy up and tell him how much he liked it			2
" much to the dismay of fans , a " @entity18 " soundtrack has never been released			1
plans for a storybook record were scrapped , and the audio master tapes are long gone			0
@entity34 said there 's a chance they 've simply been mislabeled and are somewhere in the vaults			0
" we 're still looking for them and hopefully one day there will be a @entity224 release , " he said			0
@entity34 also explained that the cast and crew had no idea that " @entity28 " was destined to become a classic			1
" everyone who worked on this simply thought they were doing a special for that year , " he said			2
" nobody thought it was going to last as long as it did			0
everyone was surprised it did as well as it did			0
they were so happy with it they aired it for the next five years and it was still getting good ratings			0
the second year it got better ratings than the first			0
" the @entity246 fans of " @entity18 " remain dedicated to keeping their beloved special 's memory alive			1
at a december 2009 screening at @entity250 in @entity251 , many of those in attendance sang along and called out lines similar to midnight screenings of " the @entity256			0
" ( but with far fewer fishnets , one would imagine			0
) " the fans are very dedicated , " said @entity34			0
" those who remember it remember it very well and are very passionate about it			0
so it 's exciting that @entity21 is putting it back on and it will be exposed to a whole new generation of viewers			0
" that whole new generation of viewers may never grasp the concept of a television event			0
" it 's funny , is n't it , that tv specials have kind of disappeared , " said @entity34			0
" at one time a special was special			1
there used to be just three networks and when someone did something unique , everyone knew about it and they set aside time to watch it			2
but now we have access to everything at any time of the day , at any place in the world , and you can watch it on a postage stamp or a screen almost as big as a movie theater screen			2
" but back in the 1960s of course , @entity96 pointed out , if you missed your favorite @entity12 special you were forced to wait for the next airing			1
" you only had that one chance , and then 52 weeks later you could see it again			0

first animated @entity12 special , " @entity18 , " is 50
" @entity28 " paved the way for " @entity5 , " " @entity298 , " " @entity11 , " " @entity9 "
though it has fallen into relative obscurity , the fan base remains solid
