-- the website for @entity3 law firm @entity2 crashed tuesday after reports emerged that human rights attorney @entity5 , who married @entity6 in late september , had changed her name to @entity8 , as seen on her professional profile page			1
everyone had to see for themselves -- and , predictably , throw up their collective arms in response			0
could it be ? could it be that this strong , career - driven woman so not - in - need of a man that she 'd waited 36 years to get married really have done something as oppressive as take on her husband 's name ? in @entity24 , @entity23 admitted " a twinge of disappointment			1
... women keeping their maiden names is not just a rare phenomenon but a decreasing one , " as if she expected @entity31 to help fight the trend			1
" dear mrs. @entity8 , " an open letter by @entity34 on the website @entity36 began , " why why , @entity38 , in 2014 , would you take your husband 's name ? you 're an appendage , an accoutrement , a chattel : mrs. @entity8			1
and i thought progressives were supposed to be -- well -- progressive ... ? " wrote another , " just think of how absurd it would be if @entity8 called himself @entity47			2
my question : who says that a woman 's entire identity is rooted in the name she was given at birth or born into ? these days , an increasing number of women are making a name for themselves professionally , as @entity5 has done and will surely continue to do			1
opinion : why more women spurn marriage the key phrase here being " for themselves			0
" whether that name is the one they were born with , the one they took after marriage or any combination thereof matters little			0
it 's just a name			0
and a woman need n't keep her name in order to prove , to anyone , that she is her own person			2
in fact , she need n't be required to prove it at all			2
if anything , it seems to be buying entirely into the patriarchy to dismiss @entity31 as being anti-feminist , or even anti-progressive , over a choice that she has , by all available evidence , made for herself			2
and we must assume it 's one she 's made , or agreed to make , or else are n't we 're the ones being sexist ? after all , the former ms. @entity5 does not seem to be a woman who has come this far in life , or career , by making decisions lightly			1
abandoning the name that made her successful -- and , in her own right , famous , if not as famous as her new husband -- does not negate those successes			0
the truth is that many women choose not to change their names after marriage ; some for professional reasons , others for personal reasons			0
do you know what a pain in the you - know - what it is to legally change your name ? and yet far more women do change their names than do n't : as much as 86 % of women , according to a 2011 survey conducted by @entity112 , take on their husband 's surname after marriage			2
and , of course , @entity31 might even relish being something of " an appendage , " as @entity119 , writing in @entity120 , described mrs. @entity8 , a new celebrity whose wedding photos run in @entity122 and whose choice of dress is covered by @entity125			1
she is accomplished , that is certain ; but now she is also @entity6 's wife , and that is something irresistible to our celebrity - obsessed culture and perhaps irresistible to @entity31 , too			1
( he is @entity6 , after all			0
) perhaps she is courting attention by changing her name			0
maybe it 's a good career move : should we fault her for using what she can to get ahead ? or should we , in fact , celebrate her for being ambitious ? that some may look to women like @entity31 to retain their name post-marriage is , of course , reflective of an unfair burden placed on women who reach certain levels of success , or notoriety , to please everyone and be the spokeswomen for an entire gender ever - aiming to assert itself as equal to men			1
by that logic , it 's not @entity31 's name change that should be viewed as anti-feminist but her willingness to get married at all			1
who needs men , right ? the bottom line is that @entity159 has proved herself to be her own woman , and a strong , independent , accomplished one at that , no matter how the name reads on her business card -- or , for that matter , her own paycheck			0
how much more do we want from her as a model of female empowerment ?			0

@entity5 changed her last name to @entity8 after she married @entity6
@entity173 notes @entity31 was *slammed* for abandoning her own name for a man 's
@entity173 : it 's just a name . it was her decision . she does n't have to prove anything
@entity173 : successful women can be models of empowerment whatever name they have
