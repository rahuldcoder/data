-- it 's not every day you meet an active field agent of @entity5 's super secret spy agency , the @entity4			1
generally , if you did , you would n't know it			0
but there he was , taking us on a tour of " @entity11 : the @entity12 " before the @entity14 guests arrived for opening night			1
this spy is the curator of the extraordinary exhibit of recently declassified spycraft chronicling the capture of @entity19 , one of the chief architects of the @entity21			1
it 's a passionate side project to document one of @entity4 's most famous successes			1
i ca n't use his name and we could n't film him , but he told us why he spent months in the archive			0
" it was our first big ' @entity31 ' operation			1
i knew we had the material in the archive , " he says , " but until today , people only knew a small part of the story , we had to tell the whole thing			2
" the story starts with @entity19 , a @entity40 ss officer put in charge of orchestrating the " final solution , " the @entity39 plan to kill all of the @entity43 in @entity44 , during @entity45 in the early 1940s			1
@entity19 was the chief logistician , organizing transport for millions of @entity43 to the gas chambers			1
in the waning years of the war , when nazis were trying to destroy all evidence of the @entity21 and halted the killing , @entity19 insisted on continuing his evil work			1
at the end of @entity45 , @entity19 escaped and evaded capture several times			1
he was a wanted man , but the trail went dry			0
but in the 1950s , word began to reach @entity4 and @entity5 's domestic security service , @entity58 , that @entity19 was hiding in @entity59 using the name " @entity61			1
" at first , agents sent to @entity63 did n't believe that the shabby suburb where @entity61 lived could be the residence of a senior @entity39 officer			0
agents then traveled to @entity63 to take photos of the man who called himself @entity70			0
they pretended to be property investors			0
the small @entity74 camera , a simple converted business case with a secret camera trigger , and original photographs , are part of the " @entity11 " exhibit			1
the agents took the negatives to a developing shop in town and got three shots of an ordinary looking man standing over a barbed wire fence			0
but @entity19 was no ordinary man			2
the covert pictures were compared to @entity89 photos in @entity4 's files			1
a 10 - point analysis of his ears ( apparently ears are unique ) told @entity4 they had their man			2
@entity95 , the ceo of the @entity96 , says the exhibit shows the evolution of @entity4 , then in its early days			1
" even the mighty @entity4 started with improvising solutions , " says @entity95			2
and it 's painstakingly documented in an exhibit crammed with originals : the crudely made license plates ; the fake passports used by agents , the metal syringe used to drug @entity19			1
" what people react to in museums , aside from the story , is to see original artifacts , to feel that they are in the presence of the real thing , " he says			0
" and to all of us it symbolized evil , it symbolized the @entity21 , it symbolized the notion of justice			0
" to bring @entity19 to justice , 11 agents traveled to @entity63 under assumed names			2
dozens of @entity43 living in @entity63 helped provide the cover needed to succeed			0
the agents put @entity19 in an @entity125 crew uniform and shoved him into a @entity126			2
they slipped him onto a special @entity125 flight and spirited him out of @entity63			0
in april 1961 , the trial of @entity19 began in @entity129			2
during nine months of testimony , the world was astounded by the personal testimony of 120 witnesses ( 99 of them @entity21 survivors )			0
the impact was greatest in @entity5			0
" i grew up in @entity5			0
i was born here , " says @entity95			0
" the whole notion for young @entity5 growing up here -- of the @entity21 , of the @entity21 -- was very much not spoken of , it was hidden , we were in shock			0
" " the capture of @entity19 -- bringing him to court and to justice in @entity129 -- was for so many @entity5 of my generation a watershed event			1
it actually brought out the stories and the horror of what happened to the @entity43 in @entity44			0
" the " @entity11 " exhibit ends with the actual bulletproof glass booth where @entity19 sat impassively during the duration of the nine - month trial			1
the agents who painstakingly tracked down and captured @entity19 were after one thing : justice .			2
