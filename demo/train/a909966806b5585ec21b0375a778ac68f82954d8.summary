@entity0 , @entity1 -- at 14 , while attending the @entity6 @entity5 camp in @entity7 , @entity3 asked one question to troops returning from overseas military service			1
their simple answer spurred the small - town teen into action			1
@entity3 , center in black shirt , spends her saturdays sorting cds and dvds for troops overseas			1
" i asked , ' what was the number one thing they missed ? ' " recalls @entity3			1
" the first thing was , of course , their families			0
but second to that was entertainment			0
" they described limited access to @entity31 and satellite service , with some soldiers sharing just a few dvds or cds with an entire unit			1
so @entity3 returned home and gathered her cds and dvds to send to the troops			1
what started as an individual project at home is now 16 - year - old @entity3 's nationwide nonprofit , @entity43			1
since 2005 , she and volunteers have organized the collection and delivery of more than 200,000 cds and dvds to deployed service members around the world			1
" my mission is not about supporting or opposing the war , it 's about supporting the troops , " says @entity3 , whose own family has a military background			1
" they sacrifice so much for us , why ca n't i do a little bit to give back to them ? " reaching out to friends , classmates and community members for donated discs of all kinds , @entity3 's own community joined her cause			1
she made disc donations easy by placing tunes 4 the @entity70 collection boxes at football games , churches , neighborhood events , and community centers			0
her own @entity75 helped out by setting up an account for the school 's management of financial donations -- for disc purchases , packing supplies , and shipping costs			2
" it first started with my collection , then my friends chipped in with their music and movies , and it just spread and spread through my community -- and now , nationwide , " says @entity3			2
" it 's great to see the amount of people that care			0
" when she receives a cd or dvd , @entity3 first sends a hand - written " thank you " to the donor			2
then she separates all discs into genres and combs through them to ensure there is no explicit , burned or copied material			0
each disc to be sent is branded with a @entity103 , which allows a soldier who has never heard of her organization to request more items			0
" that way , if they get sent to a unit , and then that unit gives it to another unit , that unit can always request a box , " explains @entity3			2
@entity115 explain the way she and volunteers support troops overseas » each saturday , the teen tapes , wraps and labels boxes before spending about two hours at the post office			0
@entity3 originally stored donations and materials in her home , but in 2006 , her local @entity126 donated a small shed for @entity43 4 the @entity70 operations			1
today , the organization has about 200 satellite locations across the @entity6 and has collected more than $ 3 million worth of donations			2
they also hold yearly @entity132 fundraisers , which have grossed close to $ 5,000 for each of the past two years			0
@entity115 describe the rewards of bringing entertainment to @entity6 soldiers overseas » in addition to @entity43 , @entity3 also runs track , maintains a 4.0 @entity139 , and works night shifts at a restaurant , admitting that life can get " a bit stressful sometimes			2
" she recently received the @entity144 , missing her junior prom to be in @entity146 for the honor			0
but she says her own sacrifices pale in comparison to those made by thousands of @entity6 soldiers everyday			0
watch soldiers overseas describe the impact tunes 4 the @entity70 has had on them » " i love what i do because it 's not just affecting me , it 's affecting thousands of other people , " she says			0
" to have such a large outcome of happy soldiers is so worth it			0
" @entity3 's goal ? she hopes to collect and ship 500,000 cds and dvds to deployed soldiers overseas by the end of the year .			1
