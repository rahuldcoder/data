-- no team has ever retained the @entity3 title since the competition was revamped in 1992 -- but perhaps , finally , this will be the year			1
@entity5 ensured @entity7 's place in the last - 16 by firing his side to a 1 - 0 win over @entity10 to make it four wins from four			1
the @entity13 international netted a 27th minute winner after @entity7 was made to work hard against a much - changed visiting side			1
@entity17 , who wasted a number of opportunities , was left frustrated after failing to overturn @entity21 's @entity3 goals record			1
@entity17 remains on 70 , one behind @entity21 , while his chief rival , @entity23 's @entity22 , plays tomorrow			0
@entity22 , who has 69 , faces @entity24 in @entity25 on wednesday and could leapfrog the @entity27 star			0
@entity7 's 12th successive victory was more labored than most would have expected given the side 's previous encounter			1
a fortnight ago , @entity7 rolled into @entity31 , a venue where it had never managed a victory , and blew @entity10 away within first 41 minutes of the contest			1
led by @entity17 , @entity7 scored three times in the first half before playing out the remainder of the contest in second gear			1
since then , @entity7 has continued its fine form , defeating @entity23 in the @entity41 and extending its winning streak to 11 games in succession			1
its fortunes could scarcely be any more different to those of @entity10 , a club whose season is already in danger of unraveling			1
since the departure of @entity51 to @entity23 , @entity10 , which finished second in the @entity52 last season , has endured a dismal period in which the success of last year appears nothing but a distant memory			1
defeat by @entity58 last weekend left @entity10 12 points behind leader @entity61 after just 10 games with the pair set to meet at @entity31 on saturday			1
@entity64 , the manager , has come in for criticism with a number of his preseason signings failing to impress			0
one of those , @entity69 , has been heavily criticized , unfairly for the most part , though his failure to score a @entity52 goal in any of his eight appearances has raised concern			2
at the @entity75 , where @entity7 had not tasted defeat in its previous 19 @entity3 matches , @entity10 stepped out as heavy underdogs			1
@entity64 , wary of the importance of sunday 's clash with @entity61 , omitted several of his regulars from the starting line - up			2
@entity83 , the long - serving captain and undisputed leader , was left on the bench alongside the stellar talent of @entity87 and the aforementioned @entity69			2
for a club such as @entity10 , a five - time champion and one of the proudest and most distinguished clubs in @entity94 football , this was some statement			1
for four years @entity10 had sought to be part of this elite competition and yet , at the home of arguably @entity99 's greatest club , it named a team which appeared something of a gamble			1
@entity103 , 33 , was recalled in central defense , while @entity105 , the striker who came close to leaving @entity10 in august , started the contest in attack			2
for @entity7 , boasting its full array of ' @entity110 ' , this was a game which was supposed to be a mere procession			2
just three minutes had elapsed before @entity112 , the @entity10 goalkeeper , was called into action , pushing away @entity115 's fine effort which threatened to sail into the far corner			2
the @entity117 international , who has been prone to mistakes on a number of occasions this season , then denied @entity17 as the home team began to find its rhythm			0
@entity10 , without so many first team regulars , may have been expected to fold meekly and yet , for the opening 20 minutes at least , it showed the kind of energy which has seldom been seen so far this season			2
but there was nothing it could do when @entity7 did eventually take the lead through the prolific @entity5			1
the @entity13 international , whose brace at @entity31 put @entity10 to the sword a fortnight ago , found space at the far post and expertly tucked home @entity139 's pinpoint cross			2
both @entity5 and @entity17 squandered further opportunities before the interval as @entity10 somehow managed to remain in contention			1
the second half followed a similar pattern with real dominating possession , though it seldom managed to find a way past a solid @entity10 defense			2
@entity5 flashed an effort wide of the far post and @entity17 's free kick stung the palms of @entity112 , but @entity10 coped admirably			1
@entity153 's drive , which flashed wide of the far post , ensured @entity7 could n't rest on its laurels , though the visiting side barely registered as an attacking force			2
@entity157 , a 62nd substitute , crashed an effort against the crossbar , but @entity7 held out comfortably to book its place in the last - 16			1
while @entity7 is through to the next stage , @entity10 will probably need to win its final two games against @entity164 side @entity163 and @entity166 team @entity165 to qualify			1
" we had the courage to play and i 'm very proud of the team tonight , " @entity64 told @entity167			0
" we showed wonderful composure			0
" i knew what i was doing			0
i knew what the team would be tonight			0
we are disappointed with the result but there are many positives tonight			0
some of the young players did very well			0
" there 's every chance of us qualifying still			0
we always thought it would come down to the last game and it is in our hands			0
" @entity10 has three points from its four matches and has not scored in the competition since the opening round			2
@entity163 , which overcame @entity165 of @entity166 4 - 0 , sits three points ahead of @entity10 and has already beaten the @entity52 side in the competition this season			1
@entity192 cruise elsewhere , @entity192 booked its place in the next round with a 4 - 1 win over @entity196			1
but @entity197 will have to wait after somehow managing to throw away a three - goal lead to draw 3 - 3 with @entity199			2
@entity201 's penalty and @entity203 's strike gave @entity197 a halftime lead before @entity205 added a third after 58 minutes			0
the home side looked certain to claim its place in the next round but perhaps it had not expected what was to follow			0
@entity209 netted a 61st minute penalty before adding a second soon after			0
and in the final minute of the contest , @entity212 stunned those inside @entity215 by plundering a dramatic equalizer			0
" we had some bad luck , the first goal was offside but we had a lack of concentration and thought the game was won , " @entity197 manager @entity217 told @entity218			0
" overall we were poor defensively from the first to the last minute			0
at 3 - 2 you have to secure yourself and we were not cautious enough			0
it was very poor defending			0
" am i angry or disappointed ? both			0
" @entity228 scored a stunning free kick as @entity230 secured a 3 - 2 victory over @entity232			1
@entity228 , making his 100th @entity3 appearance , opened the scoring in @entity235 with @entity236 netting a 66th minute winner			1
" it was a very important game for us tonight , we had to win and we did it , " @entity236 told @entity99			0
" i am happy with my goal , but i am happier for the result			0
" in the night 's other games , @entity243 won 2 - 0 at @entity245 , @entity242 defeated @entity246 1 - 0 and @entity247 claimed an impressive 2 - 1 victory at @entity249 .			0

@entity7 qualifies for last - 16 of @entity3
@entity5 scores only goal against @entity10
@entity228 scores on 100th @entity3 appearance
@entity192 qualify for knockout phase
