-- want to ride an elevator into space ? while the idea has been around for more than 100 years , a breakthrough in nanotechnology could mean we will be riding into space on a cable made of diamonds			1
scientists at @entity11 in the @entity12 released a research paper last month that showed the way forward to producing ultra-thin " diamond nanothreads " that have a strength and stiffness greater than that of today 's strongest nanotubes and polymers			1
@entity21 , professor of chemistry at @entity11 , told @entity0 his team had made the breakthrough while examining the properties of benzene molecules and that it took 18 months of study to make sense of what the team had been seeing			1
" it is as if an incredible jeweler has strung together the smallest possible diamonds into a long miniature necklace , " @entity21 said			2
" because this thread is diamond at heart , we expect that it will prove to be extraordinarily stiff , extraordinarily strong , and extraordinarily useful			2
" benzene breakthrough the experiments involved putting benzene -- a liquid -- under compression to form a solid material			2
" what we found was that because our experiment compressed the benzene much more slowly than had been done before , these new materials formed , " he said			0
" everybody thought that the benzene molecules would link together in a way that was very disorganized , like a glassy amorphous material			0
" instead , what caught our attention was that our experiments told us there was order in the benzene and that was the shock , " he said			0
that all this occurred at room temperature was a further shock to the research team			0
under pressure he said the scientists worked to test the hypothesis that when benzene molecules break under high pressure , their atoms want to grab onto something else but ca n't because the pressure removes the space between them			1
" this benzene then becomes highly reactive so that , when we release the pressure very slowly , an orderly polymerization reaction happens that forms the diamond - core nanothread , " he said			2
what results is a material that is the strongest and stiffest known to science , but is also very lightweight			0
" one of our wildest dreams for the nanomaterials we are developing is that they could be used to make the super-strong , lightweight cables that would make possible the construction of a " space elevator " which so far has existed only as a science - fiction idea , " @entity21 said			1
next stop ... outer space the @entity91 construction company @entity90 is already investigating the feasibility of a space elevator , envisioning a space station tethered to the equator by a 96,000km cable made of carbon nanotechnology			1
the space station would orbit the earth in a geostationary position with the cable held taut through the centrifugal force of the earth 's rotation - in much the same a hammer thrower spins the hammer at the @entity106			1
robotic cars with magnetic motors would take seven days to reach the space station , lifting cargoes and people into space at a fraction of the current cost			1
according to the @entity116 ( @entity117 ) , space payloads would cost in the order of just hundreds of dollars per kilogram rather than the current $ 20,000 a kilogram that rocket technology costs			1
the key is in the small scale at the core of the project is the nanotechnology that would make cables from a material harder and stronger than any currently found on @entity129			1
a 2.5 - inch thick cable made from carbon nanotechnology could lift the equivalent of three @entity133 per day into orbit , according to @entity117			1
" the tensile strength is almost a hundred times stronger than steel cables so it 's possible , " @entity135 , a research and development manager at @entity90 told the @entity136			0
" right now we ca n't make the cable long enough			1
we can only make 3 - centimeter - long nanotubes , but we need much more ... we think by 2030 we 'll be able to do it			2
" goodbye , rocket man a space elevator is not the only non-rocket technology being investigated as a means of getting man - made objects into space			1
in the past @entity151 has examined everything from high - velocity artillery to rail - launched maglev projects as a way of getting objects into space			2
@entity157 of @entity151 's @entity158 said for the time being , @entity151 's emphasis is on developing exploration technologies to be used once a craft is already in space			2
" and there are many challenges in that area , " @entity157 told @entity0			0
nevertheless , the space agency continues to look at systems -- some of them quite bizarre such as the @entity171 -- that could achieve orbit without the use of fuel - hungry rocket systems			2
" the space elevator is an interesting concept but will require a breakthrough in materials or the addition of a totally new concept to make it work			1
i do n't foresee space elevator working in my lifetime , " @entity157 said			1
" i briefly looked at the @entity171 concept and do n't believe it is feasible			0
" when physics gets in the way certain problems of aerodynamics and physics , he said , persist despite technological advances			0
while some concepts that use high velocities -- such as super artillery -- can work , balancing the greater aerodynamic forces with problems of heating remain			0
" for example if you directly launch a small satellite out of a cannon with enough velocity to reach orbit , the projectile will probably be destroyed by the heat and stress , " he said			0
" if not , most of your mass is devoted to the structure and not much to the working payload			0
" even so , he said @entity151 has not abandoned the idea of a non-rocket launch			0
" i believe @entity151 will eventually invest in advanced non-rocket launch technology , but i do n't think it will be very soon , " @entity157 said			0
" i would like to @entity151 establish a group , preferably networked from a number of @entity151 centers , that is actively looking new launch technologies and making recommendations for new investigations			0
" read more from tomorrow transformed : can this one - wheeled wonder change the way you commute to work ? the " green man " in your traffic lights just got new super powers finally , a flying car for everybody ?			0

developments in nanotechnology could make an elevator to space possible
a cable of carbon nanotechnology could tether a space station to earth
scientists at @entity11 have created ' diamond nanothreads '
the ride up into space would take seven days , but would cost a fraction of current methods
