@entity0 , @entity1 -- he ventures into the forest looking for his daughters , armed with bow and arrow in case the terrorists surprise him			1
the odds are stacked against him			0
no one has found the 276 girls abducted from their school last month by the terror group @entity16			1
but then again , no one 's really been looking , the father says			1
that night of horror the father 's voice shakes as he recalls the night his two daughters were snatched from their dormitory at an all - girls school in @entity1			1
it began with an explosion so loud that it shook buildings in the northern village of @entity29 , waking the girls ' family			1
that was quickly followed by the sound of gunfire echoing into the dark night			0
by the time father made it to the @entity38 , the militants had already opened fire on security guards and set buildings on fire			1
unarmed , there was nothing the father could do but watch ... and wait			1
" when i went into the school compound , nobody will ever stand it , " said the father , who is not being identified for fear of reprisals from attackers or the government			1
" you will see their dresses cut out all over			0
and the hostel and dormitory , everything was bombed into ashes			0
so this man told us they have gone with our daughters			2
we could n't believe him			0
" armed members of @entity16 attacked the school on april 14 , overpowering the guards and herding the girls onto waiting trucks , according to accounts of that night			1
the trucks disappeared with the girls into the dense forest bordering @entity73 , a stronghold for the terror group whose name translates to " @entity79 education is sin " in the local @entity82 language			2
that 's where the story gets hazy			0
mixed messages from the government there are questions about just how many girls were taken , with varying reports putting that number between 230 to 276 , depending on who is talking			2
in the days after the attack , the military said all the girls had been released or rescued			1
but after the girls ' families began asking where their daughters were , the military retracted the statement			1
this much the father knows for sure : his two daughters are among those still in captivity after almost a month			1
@entity1 officials have defended their response and said they are searching			2
" we 've done a lot -- but we are not talking about it , " presidential spokesman @entity109 said			0
" we 're not @entity112			0
we 're not showing people , you know , but it does not mean that we are not doing something			0
" but the father scoffed at the government 's response			2
" we have never seen any military man there , " he said			2
" had it been military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters , we would have seen them			1
" ' we ca n't let this be the new normal ' terrorists fill the void @entity16 , on the other hand , is entrenched in the region			1
the father believes that either supporters or members of @entity16 live in his village			1
they know his family , the father says			2
they know about his daughters			2
the family is so afraid , he says , that they have fled their home and taken to sleeping in the bush			0
" life is very dangerous in @entity29 right now			0
since on 14th of april , to date , we do n't sleep at home , " the father said			1
the father said that starting around 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening , " people will disappear into the bush because there is no security			2
" " we sleep in the bush with all of our little ones , " he said			2
a violent force , a mother 's plea @entity16 is a ruthless , powerful force			1
the group says its goal is to impose stricter enforcement of @entity165 law across @entity167 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority @entity169 north and a mostly @entity172 south			0
under its version of @entity165 law , women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands , not at school learning to read and write			2
a video that surfaced this week showed a man claiming to be the group 's leader saying he will sell the hundreds kidnapped girls			2
" i abducted your girls			0
i will sell them in the market , by @entity192 , " said a man claiming to be @entity189			0
" there is a market for selling humans			0
@entity192 says i should sell			0
he commands me to sell			0
" the mother of the two girls had little response , just tears			1
" most of the women , we mothers , we started crying because had no one to help us , " she said			0
" our daughters ( have ) been adopted or captured as slaves			1
now ... we can not even eat			0
" this is n't the parents ' first experience with @entity16			1
they adopted one of their two daughters after her parents were killed by the terrorist group			1
the mother begs for the girls ' freedom , away from a lifetime of abuse and slavery			1
" they do n't know , probably one of them are born a president or doctor or pastor or a lawyer who will be helpful to the country , " she said			0
" why would they molest these little ones ? please ... release them			0
" @entity232 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 ; @entity233 and @entity234 reported and wrote from @entity235			0
@entity2 's @entity236 also contributed to this report .			0

a father says despite officials ' claims , he has seen no military presence
parents and children sleep in the bushes , fearing more attacks by @entity16
the father has searched for the girls himself , venturing out with bow and arrow
mother : our daughters have been adopted or captured as slaves
