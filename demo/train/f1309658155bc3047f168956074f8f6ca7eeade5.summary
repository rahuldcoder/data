@entity21 also talked on the phone with @entity117 secretary of state @entity116			2

@entity109 : ' only on equal terms ' @entity109 said @entity110 had been obliged to annex @entity1 's @entity152 in march in order to prevent @entity155 forces entering , which would have created " a completely different alignment of forces			1

" @entity110 's ambassador to the @entity148 , @entity188 , said tuesday that the refusal to extend the cease - fire is a " negative sign , " the @entity187 said on @entity192			1

" the crisis has its roots in former president @entity223 's decision last year to shun a @entity224 and turn toward @entity110 instead			0
the move unleashed deadly strife that led to @entity223 's ouster , @entity1 's loss of @entity152 , and a @entity14 separatist rebellion			2
@entity110 also massed troops along its western border with @entity1			2
the @entity224 , which will bring closer trade and political ties between @entity1 and @entity234 , was finally signed by @entity21 and @entity234 leaders last week			1
after monday 's phone call , @entity21 said his goal was peace but insisted it takes the participation of all parties to maintain stability , noting violations of the cease - fire by @entity14 separatists			1
