the escalating conflict in @entity6 " essentially puts the nation on the brink of civil war , " @entity1 president @entity0 said on tuesday			1
his assessment came during a telephone conversation with his @entity11 counterpart , according to the @entity12 , the same day @entity6 's military launched its first , formal military action against @entity15 militants with troops retaking an airport in the eastern @entity19 region after a reported clash with gunmen			1
the military action came a day after a @entity6 ultimatum expired for protesters to lay down their arms , a move that appeared to signal an escalation in the crisis that has sparked a diplomatic row between @entity6 , its western allies and @entity1			1
with @entity15 militants seizing government and police buildings in as many as 10 towns and cities in eastern @entity6 , acting president @entity31 told @entity36 " an anti-terrorist operation " was under way in the region			1
the aim of the military operation is to " stop attempts to tear @entity6 to pieces , " he told lawmakers			1
witnesses reported hearing gunfire and aircraft that appeared to be coming from the airfield in @entity49 , which @entity31 's office said was under the control of @entity53 special forces late tuesday			0
there were conflicting reports about casualties , with @entity1 state - run media citing varying casualty claims supplied by militants			0
according to the reports , there were either two injured or four killed , claims that @entity62 can not independently verify			0
brink of civil war ? @entity0 's comments followed similar ones hours earlier from @entity1 prime minister @entity66 warned @entity6 was on a violent path			1
" @entity6 is on the brink of civil war			1
and i hope that everyone who is responsible for making decisions at the moment -- i mean both , the current @entity6 authorities , who we ca n't consider legitimate , but these are the authorities who came to power as result of a coup -- has brains to avoid driving the country to such shocks , " he said at a news conference tuesday in @entity76			2
the @entity15 uprising follows @entity1 's annexation last month of @entity6 's @entity90 region , a move that emboldened other @entity15 @entity6 in the country 's east to rise up			1
@entity1 has said it reserves the right to intervene to protect the rights of ethnic @entity1 in eastern @entity6			2
during the conversation with @entity11 chancellor @entity96 , @entity0 also raised concerns about what he called an " anti-constitutional course " taken by @entity6 authorities in @entity101 to suppress protests			1
despite what @entity96 's office described as " different assessments of the events on the ground in @entity6 , " the focus of the conversation was on preparations for a meeting in @entity111 among the foreign ministers of @entity1 , @entity6 , the @entity113 and the @entity114 to find a way to reduce tensions in the region			1
in a sign of the divisions roiling the country , @entity119 footage posted online appeared to show two openly pro-russian presidential candidates who have demonstrated support for separatists being antagonized by crowds in separate incidents in @entity101 on monday night			0
in one video , @entity128 , a presidential candidate for the @entity129 , the party of ousted president @entity130 , had flour and green liquid thrown at him as he addressed crowds			0
another clip showed @entity136 , an independent candidate who was expelled from the @entity129 , speaking to people without a shirt as he apparently sought to show the bruising he 'd received from an aggressive crowd			0
in the third video , @entity136 tries to leave a tv station , where crowds shout " @entity143 ! shame ! shame ! " his supporters and protesters end up in a brief scuffle			0
@entity62 has not been able independently to verify the amateur video clips			0
@entity150 , @entity114 are ' deeply concerned ' the escalating tensions in the region -- along with reports of violence -- have raised concerns among @entity114 defense ministers and @entity150 secretary general @entity157 , who met tuesday in @entity158			2
as he arrived for the talks , @entity157 told reporters he was " deeply concerned " by the latest developments in @entity6			2
" i call on @entity1 to de-escalate the crisis , to pull back its troops from @entity6 's borders , to stop destabilizing the situation in @entity6 and make clear that it does n't support the violent actions of pro-russian separatists , " he said			1
" @entity1 should stop being part of the problem and start being part of the solution			0
" he said @entity150 and the @entity114 are not discussing military options and that they support a diplomatic and political solution to the crisis			0
" however , we are focused militarily on strengthening defense of our allies			0
that 's our core task , " he said			0
@entity6 deployed a @entity180 battalion of 350 troops to the @entity19 region from @entity101 on tuesday morning , said @entity183 , a spokesman for @entity6 's @entity184			1
the @entity180 troops -- many of them former street protesters who signed up after the interim government took power in february -- have had only a few weeks of training			0
military column a @entity62 team in eastern @entity6 encountered a large @entity6 military column traveling on roads leading from the city of @entity19 toward other towns in the region			1
the column included more than 20 armored personnel carriers , along with support vehicles , and a helicopter circled overhead			0
the troops , who were carrying the @entity6 flag , appeared to be headed north and east , although their precise destination was unclear			2
the @entity15 mayor of @entity205 claimed tuesday that a @entity6 military convoy including troops and armored vehicles had now surrounded the town , @entity1 state news agency @entity210 reported			1
" if they try to move in , we will have to stop them , " it quoted him as saying			0
pro-russian protesters seized a police building over the weekend in @entity205 , some 100 miles from the border with @entity1			0
from a hill overlooking the town , a @entity62 team saw no obvious signs of a large - scale operation , such as military helicopters or planes			1
amid the unfolding crisis , @entity6 's most senior security and defense officials are to meet for a closed session with all members of @entity36 on wednesday morning , @entity31 said			1
pretext for intervention ? the unrest is the latest in a series of events ratcheting up tensions between @entity6 and @entity1 , which @entity101 accuses of fomenting trouble in @entity1 - speaking eastern @entity6			2
after then - @entity6 leader @entity130 backed out of a deal with the @entity114 in november in favor of closer ties with @entity1 , he was forced from office in february , the result of months of protests in @entity101			2
distrust among the population in eastern @entity6 , the base of @entity130 's power , grew as the new national government shifted rapidly in a @entity249 direction			1
a short time later , pro-russian elements occupied the @entity252 peninsula of @entity90 , which @entity1 annexed in march			0
since then , @entity15 protesters have taken to the streets in eastern @entity6 and in some cases stormed and occupied buildings			2
@entity101 's fragile new government and the @entity249 accuse @entity1 of destabilizing the region as a pretext to potentially send in troops to protect the local @entity1 - speaking population			2
@entity150 says @entity1 armed forces are massing on @entity6 's eastern border , while @entity76 says they are merely carrying out military exercises			1
a @entity265 human rights report released tuesday on the situation in @entity6 cited an urgent need to counter " misinformation , propaganda and incitement to hatred " in the country to avoid the further escalation of tensions			2
" facts on the ground need to be established to help reduce the risk of radically different narratives being exploited for political ends , " said @entity276 @entity275			0
