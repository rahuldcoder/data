@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 founder @entity3 said the massively popular movie database has set as its major goal for the future to add one - button streaming for all of the 1.3 million titles it indexes			1
@entity4 , the popular movie database , hopes to add one - button streaming for all of its 1.3 million titles			1
obviously , the vision is a long - term one , @entity3 acknowledged , and it faces hurdles from the slew of content owners who control the vast library of titles the @entity4 provides information about , but as a leading movie - oriented site , it 's a very important goal to articulate in public			1
@entity3 was speaking monday afternoon at the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) @entity27 here			1
oddly , though his talk was part of the film festival , the room was packed almost entirely by attendees of the associated @entity33			0
ostensibly , @entity3 was talking about the history of @entity4 -- from its founding even before the advent of the @entity37 , to its launch as a dot - com site to its being bought by @entity40			1
but late in the talk , he explained how he wants to make it possible for the 57 million monthly unique visitors to the site to watch , with the click of one button , all the movies , tv shows , and other video content indexed on the site			1
it will be difficult to fulfill the vision , @entity3 said , " because many of the films may not exist anymore and many may not be available for streaming			2
" but these days , free or paid streaming of movies is available from a number of sources , including : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( a part of @entity64 , which publishes @entity2 ) , @entity40 , @entity65 , and others			0
each of those sources , though , has its own arrangement with the content owners , so for @entity4 to get access to the entire library would be a massive undertaking			1
still , rather than being a throw - away line that did n't carry any weight , @entity3 reiterated at the end of the talk that the vision was one of the company 's major goals for 2009 and beyond			2
already , @entity4 has begun adding streaming content to the site , a program that began in september			2
right now , @entity3 said , there are 14,000 full - length tv episodes and a couple of thousand full - length movies available on the site , as well as 120,000 other pieces of video content , many of which are movie trailers , interviews , and featurettes			2
and he said that the site is adding thousands of new pieces of video content per week			0
at that rate , however , it 's sure to take the site quite some time to achieve the goal			0
@entity3 said he imagined a time three years from now when we will all look back at early 2009 , when so many media sites are trying to solve the problem of making content available to those who want it in the face of resistance from the @entity111 and @entity112 , and we 'll shake our heads at where we were at			0
" we 'll laugh at how little we knew about what business models would work , " @entity3 said			0
