-- in 1996 , when she was 4 years old , @entity1 learned she had aplastic anemia			1
for seven years , she lived from hospital visit to hospital visit , one transfusion to the next			1
it was n't until the summer of 2002 that her world suddenly included what was possible beyond the walls of her illness			1
for many of the years in between , her disease controlled her life -- aplastic anemia is a type of bone marrow failure that made it impossible to produce enough red blood cells to support her body			1
in 2001 , @entity1 spent three weeks in isolation at a clinic so that she could get a bone marrow transplant			1
all visitors had to scrub down before entering the room , and her mother had to wear a surgical mask if she slept there			0
when she went back to school , @entity1 had kept up academically , but the social environment at the school made for a difficult transition			1
" i was definitely clearly very aware that i was different from the other kids in my class , in a lot of ways -- in terms of maturity , in terms of risk taking , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" there 's just this gap in experience , because i 've just done things and been to places that they just have n't			2
" to help her meet other kids who understood , @entity1 's doctors encouraged her to go to a special summer camp for seriously ill children			1
@entity50 were started by actor @entity51 " to acknowledge luck ; the chance of it , the benevolence of it in my life , and the brutality of it in the lives of others , made especially savage for children because they may not be allowed the good fortune of a lifetime to correct it			1
" the camp @entity1 attended , in @entity65 , @entity66 , is staffed by cabin counselors , doctors and nurses , and it prides itself on giving kids a place where they will feel " safe , respected and loved			1
" for these kids , suffering from diseases such as hemophilia , sickle cell anemia and cancer , it is a chance to see past the walls of the hospital to what the world might be like if a diagnosis did n't control their every move , if clinics and hospital rooms were n't like second homes			1
ceo @entity88 has been with the camp since it started in 1988			2
he describes it as a place where children are encouraged to look beyond what they thought was possible : " they 've been told over and over again what they ca n't do			2
and camp reminds them that there 's an enormous amount of things that they can do			0
" @entity102 is a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who 's getting more training at @entity105 and has volunteered at the camp for four years			0
outside of the summer , she works closely with many sick children in hospitals and clinics ; at the camp , she sees ill children in an entirely different light			0
what she sees -- children dancing around dining halls , inviting and insisting that she join in -- is invigorating			0
" seeing kids kind of ignore their disease was amazing			0
that they have to take medicine when they eat their meals was n't a big deal			2
they could be normal , " she told @entity0			2
" @entity125 " was not something @entity1 was that familiar with before camp			1
the start of camp coincided with the one - year anniversary of her transplant , and her doctors were just starting to use the word " cure			2
" at the camp , @entity1 was embraced by young counselors , eager to get to know her			1
many of the counselors were in college , which helped her envision what had for so long been an intangible future			1
" my sort of vision of my life had always been very narrowed , and it was always very much a day - by - day			2
it was like in a week , i have to get another blood transfusion , and in a couple months , we 're gon na be changing my medication , and in a couple months , we 're gon na transplant , " she told @entity0			0
the experience allowed @entity1 to think , " there 's things out there			1
i can set long - terms goals now			0
i can have long - term goals			0
there 's things that i 'm going to be able to do			0
" the friends from her camp still provide support and understanding today , when " normal " life can get complicated			1
explaining the intricacies of her illness could be daunting to a college freshman trying to make new friends			2
but her camp friends can commiserate over routine checkups and test results without requiring any explanation			0
the camp also changes the way children interact with authority figures			0
in hospitals , there are always many caretakers who often do things to sick children that are uncomfortable , like drawing blood or giving them medications			0
with events like " @entity180 , " the camp puts kids back in the driver 's seat			0
correctly answered trivia questions win campers the right to fling a spoonful of pudding in their counselor 's face , or spray a counselor with a @entity192 , or perhaps make lemonade mix in a counselor 's mouth			2
" @entity180 is , here 's this authority figure , but you 're allowed to throw pudding at them , you 're allowed to strike back , you 're allowed to kind of take control of the situation in a way that a lot of these kids get control over their bodies and their lives just completely taken away from them , " @entity1 said			1
" in the hospital , you 're a patient , that 's all you are ; in a lot of ways , you are your illness			2
and here , you 're getting up on stage and you 're a singer or you 're a wood shop craftsman or you 're a fisherman , you get to try different things , and so you can take back a sense of ' i like to fish , i 'm good at this , i discovered this talent , ' " she told @entity0			0
this year , as @entity1 finishes up her first year of college , she looks forward to many possibilities , such as medical research and graduate school			1
but she says the camp has also opened up her eyes to the social side of medicine , and she is considering going into public health or pursuing a job that supports patients			0
but for now , she is just excited about her summer job			0
she 'll be going back to the camp that changed her life , but this time as a counselor			0
for thousands of very sick children around the world , summer camp is not just a place to escape parents and make new friends .			0

in 1996 , @entity1 learned she had aplastic anemia , hospital stays became her norm
@entity50 , started by @entity51 , helped her transition to more normal life
there , campers learn how the world might be if a diagnosis did n't control their every move
as @entity1 finishes up her first year of college , she looks forward to many possibilities
