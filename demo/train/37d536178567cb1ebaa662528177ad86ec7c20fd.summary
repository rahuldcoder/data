-- shark experts began arriving in the @entity4 resort of @entity5 on tuesday to investigate what led to four attacks over the last week that killed a @entity10 woman and injured three snorkelers , officials said			1
the behavioral experts will form an advisory team to assess and advise on the best course of action following the attacks , according to @entity17 , general operations manager of the @entity18 in @entity5			0
the tab for the expert advice is being picked up by the @entity21			0
@entity17 said the reason behind the shark attacks needs to be determined in order to stop it			1
@entity5 beach will remain closed until the shark responsible for sunday 's fatal attack is found , according to @entity4 's @entity28			1
a 70 - year - old woman , a regular guest at the resort , was snorkeling near a reef on sunday when she was attacked , he said			1
she called for help , and a lifeguard brought her to shore , but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed , @entity17 said			0
the woman 's arm and leg had been severed , he said			2
amateur video of the attack showed splashing in shallow water as boaters looked on			2
" it came at her , " said the tourist and videographer , who asked not to be identified			0
the shark " kept biting her while she was screaming for help and trying to get away , " he said			2
the videographer 's voice can be heard in the video , growing increasingly loud as the attack continued without apparent intervention from onlookers aboard nearby boats			2
" look at the blood , " he said			0
" after the incident , the @entity59 called on its members in the region " to stop any snorkeling activities happening from any boats or shore			0
" the chamber is under the umbrella of the @entity68			0
on friday , two sharks were caught and killed near the @entity70 on the @entity5 coast , according to the @entity59			1
the three injured snorkelers -- two @entity75 women and a man from the @entity77 -- were attacked in a 24 - hour period november 30 and december 1 , the chamber said			1
@entity17 said he is not a marine biologist , but many have speculated an oceanic white - tipped shark was responsible for the @entity10 woman 's death , as well as the other attacks			1
but the videographer of sunday 's attack said the shark he filmed did not have white markings on its fins			1
some are upset because the two sharks killed friday are thought to be innocent			1
they were a mako shark and another oceanic white - tipped shark -- which did not match pictures taken by someone accompanying one of the injured snorkelers , @entity17 said			1
" this incident has clearly shocked our community , and the @entity103 is continuing its investigation into why this may have happened , " @entity98 , head of the @entity59 , said in the statement			0
" it is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic ( white tipped ) shark was triggered by an activity , most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area			1
" several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week , @entity17 said			2
it 's not known how they got there , he said , but they could have washed out to sea or fallen off a boat			0
the shark may have been attracted by the carcass , he said , and could now be attacking slow - moving things on the water 's surface			2
@entity17 also said chumming could be to blame for the attacks			0
@entity133 is a mixture of blood and dead fish parts , which is used to lure sharks			0
@entity0 's @entity138 and @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

officials have closed area beaches until the shark is found
