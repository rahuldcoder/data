last week , he said he was sorry about his bizarre , drunken outburst on @entity3 about an @entity5 citizen held prisoner in @entity7			1
now , @entity0 says he 's sorry about what 's going on inside @entity7 , a nation renowned for its human rights abuses			1
but the eccentric former @entity11 star known as " @entity0 " is n't contrite about his latest puzzling visit to the secretive state			2
he said he did nothing wrong by organizing a basketball game last week at a packed stadium in @entity17 , an event at which he sang " @entity22 " to @entity7 leader @entity21			1
" i 'm sorry for what 's going on in @entity7 , the certain situations , " @entity0 told @entity3 on monday after arriving at @entity23 from @entity17			1
he did n't say exactly what those " situations " are			0
he may have been referring to the reports of horrific human rights abuses by his friend @entity29 's regime , or to the estimated 200,000 people kept in political prison camps			2
or maybe he was talking about @entity33 , the @entity5 citizen sentenced last year to 15 years of hard labor by @entity7 on accusations that he planned to bring down the government through religious activities			2
he was certainly less boisterous than when he spoke to @entity3 's @entity38 last week			1
in that interview , he appeared to suggest that @entity33 may have done something to deserve his heavy sentence			0
after his on - air rant drew criticism from @entity33 's family and others , @entity0 apologized , saying he 'd been drinking and was under stress			1
in @entity23 on monday , returning from a week - long visit to @entity7 , he struck a more humble tone			1
" i 'm not @entity49 , i 'm not ( an ) ambassador , i 'm no one , " he said			0
" i just want to show the world the fact that we can actually get along in sport			0
that is it ! " @entity0 later flew back to the @entity5 , landing at @entity57 , @entity58 , monday evening			2
he left the airport there without talking to reporters			0
' i love @entity5 ' @entity0 has described @entity29 , whose once - powerful uncle was recently purged and executed , as a friend and a " very good guy			2
" he said he was happy that by playing basketball with and in front of @entity7 -- an approach dubbed " basketball diplomacy " -- he and the other former @entity11 players who accompanied him had tried to " do something good for the world			2
" but @entity0 said he was sad that " everyone is trying to break this down , to push it on me			2
" " i do n't know why , " he said			0
" i have n't done anything wrong			0
nothing wrong ! " some observers have said @entity0 's " basketball diplomacy " may have positive effects in @entity7 by offering the people there a different view of the @entity83 , compared with its demonic portrayal in the country 's tightly controlled state media			1
but others , including human rights activists , say it 's an embarrassing media sideshow that distracts attention from the @entity7 regime 's brutality			1
@entity0 rejected suggestions that he had betrayed his country by befriending @entity29 , a dictator whose regime 's rhetoric describes the @entity5 as a mortal enemy			1
" i 'd never damage my country			0
" caught in the middle retired @entity11 player @entity102 , who went on the trip , said monday on @entity3 's " @entity104 " that he was surprised by the backlash the trip generated back home and was unaware the game would coincide with @entity29 's birthday			1
but he was apprehensive about criticizing @entity0			2
" @entity0 is a great guy			2
@entity0 is going to be @entity0 , " he said			2
" i do n't want to sit here and ever put someone that i 've supported and throw them under the bus			0
" @entity102 said he and the other players " could have probably done a little more homework as to what was going on , or ask @entity0 questions			1
" another member of @entity0 's team , @entity122 , agreed			1
" i did n't do my due diligence , " @entity122 told @entity3 's " @entity126 , " saying he did n't know anything about the political situation in @entity7			1
@entity122 , a star player for the @entity127 in the 1990s , said he now felt " very bad " about the @entity7 trip			1
he said his children got " approached " at school about his participation in the visit			0
the money question last week , @entity11 commissioner @entity134 said the former @entity11 players were " blinded by the payday , " but the players have been adamant that @entity7 did not pay them			1
i think i am astute enough to understand the dynamics , especially collecting monetary dollars from @entity7			1
no , we did not get paid from @entity7 at all , " @entity0 teammate @entity140 told @entity3 in a lengthy exclusive interview on " new day sunday			1
" @entity140 , who retired from the @entity11 in 1997 after nine seasons , said an @entity145 online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors			0
last month , the @entity145 company @entity150 said it had removed its name from @entity0 's project after the execution of @entity29 's uncle and top aide , @entity156			1
but it said it would honor its " contractual commitments " to the team			0
@entity122 said different players were paid different amounts for their participation			2
he said he received " a few thousand dollars " but less than $ 10,000			1
pressed by @entity163 , he said he would give " a portion " of his fee to charity			0
but he refused to commit to give it all away			0
@entity0 under pressure speaking by satellite from @entity23 at the weekend , @entity140 said it was n't about the money			2
he saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens			0
but he did n't see it as a birthday present for @entity29			0
" that 's the date that was set			0
i did n't know it was his birthday , " he said in the half - hour interview			0
" and it did n't matter to me once i found out that it was his birthday			0
" @entity140 said he felt for @entity0 , who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event			1
" i saw the pressure mount			0
i saw him change , and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together " once the controversy over traveling to @entity7 began , he said			1
@entity140 said that advocating for @entity33 's release was n't on their agenda			0
" we did n't go there for that			0
we went there to do what we normally do , and that 's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange , " he said .			0

ex-nba player @entity122 say he got " a few thousand dollars " for the trip
" we could have probably done a little more homework , " teammate @entity102 says
" i 'm sorry for what 's going on in @entity7 , " @entity0 tells @entity3
he stirred controversy last week by singing " @entity22 " to @entity7 leader @entity21
