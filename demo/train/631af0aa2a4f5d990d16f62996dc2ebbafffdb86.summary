-- running an airline creates an astonishing amount of waste			0
food , fuel , and the millions of tons of waste from worn carpets , uniforms and seat cushions adds up			1
fortunately , many have started to get creative with recycling , turning their used goods into bags , quilts , shoes , carpets , and in one instance , a wedding dress			2
what passengers do n't see when they board a plane is that many components have a shelf life			0
life vests , for instance , are only good for six years before they need replacing			0
even the seats have an expiration date			0
" after so many dry cleanings , seat covers lose their fire retardant coating , so by @entity42 rules , they ca n't remain on the plane , " explains @entity29 , founder of @entity30 , an design label that 's teamed with @entity32 to create bags and wallets from the carrier 's old seat covers and curtains			1
since partnering with @entity29 in 2010 , the airline has recycled 7,973 pounds of textiles			1

in those instances , any material bearing the old emblem or company colors needs to be scrapped to make way for the new			0
when @entity59 changed their uniforms 18 months ago , they had tons of useless fabric on their hands			1
they decided to give it to @entity66 , a carpet company with a zero - waste , 100 % biodegradable approach known as " cradle - to - cradle "			0
@entity69 wove the uniforms into carpets , which were kitted out on the new @entity73 cabin on @entity59 's @entity74 , this july			1
usually , @entity69 likes to know the background of products , because it affects how the materials will be used going forward			0
nylon carpets , for instance , can be recycled , and turned into new carpets			1
when a wool carpet surpasses its utility , it gets turned into secondary fuel for the cement industry , and the leftover chalk gets used for backing carpet tiles			1
@entity32 disposes its carpets in a similar way , saving 340 tons of materials from the dumpster			1
@entity93 has a more do - gooder approach			2
old uniforms get sent to clean up oil spills , blankets are shipped to refugee camps in @entity99 and airline seats get fashioned into passenger seats in @entity104 @entity103 emergency vehicles			0
@entity93 also donates clothing and furniture to workshops for special needs individuals			1
" we do n't need to make a new business opportunity for ourselves ; we 're not in the recycling business and do n't want to go into it , " says @entity109 ¤ ki , @entity93 's vice president for sustainable development			2
" instead , we 'd rather help others find and create new opportunities from our old products , " @entity93 also collaborates with design label @entity117 , which also creates bags from their old uniforms			1
the carrier also sponsors competitions with local clothing and furniture designers , pushing them to create goods from their discards			2
recently , the winner in a @entity104 wedding design competition used @entity59 uniforms to create her couture gown			2
report : airline recycling in ' sorry state ' however , @entity134 - @entity59 currently lead the pack in terms of their environmental efforts ( the company has topped the @entity139 four years running )			1
@entity140 , @entity134 's vice president of sustainable development , estimates 80 % of their on - board material is recycled and reused			1
in december , the airline teamed with upcycling design label @entity144 to create bags from old billboard posters and life jackets			0
the life jacket cases , which retailed for $ 31 , have already sold out			0
" of our projects , the bags were fun and sexy for customers and the media , but they were just one little action , " says @entity140 , who is eager to point out the many less enticing ways @entity134 has cut back on waste			2
plastic meal trays are repurposed to create plastic cutlery , the cables from seat backs are refashioned into headphones and retired aircraft are combed for reusable parts , which either get reborn in newer planes or passed on to @entity166			0
" when we launch a new product , we always ask , ' what is the life cycle of this product and what will we do with it at the end of its life ? ' " says @entity140 .			0
