-- as if dealing with the impact of devastating storm surges , drenching rains and potent winds were n't hard enough , hundreds of thousands in @entity1 and northern @entity2 battled a new adversary saturday night : the cold			1
the @entity9 forecast temperatures would dip into the 30s in @entity12 , @entity1 , and @entity13 , @entity2			1
and even after the sun rises sunday , residents may be lucky if the thermostat tops 50 degrees			1
for many , keeping warm is n't simply a matter of turning on the heat , after @entity20 knocked out gas lines and electricity			2
some 2.4 million people had no power for a fifth straight day saturday , their patience running low , along with the temperatures			1
several residents in the @entity29 , in @entity27 , vented their frustrations at @entity1 mayor @entity31 as he toured the area saturday			1
one woman yelled , " when are we going to get some help ! " while a man talked about " old ladies in my building who have got nothing			2
" supplementing and , in some cases , dissatisfied with the government response , neighbors and volunteers from afar to hard - hit areas saturday to offer food , clothing and whatever else to those who are still cold and hungry			1
" we covered two children with a blanket freezing and shivering here trying to get food last night , " @entity29 resident @entity46 told @entity0 affiliate @entity47			2
" we said we had to do something			2
" official : @entity20 - stricken areas will vote ' come hell or high water ' at a saturday news conference , @entity31 admitted he 'd encountered many who were " worried and frustrated and cold " and urged those without electricity to go to a shelter or find another " warm place " to stay			1
" please , i know sometimes people are reticent to take advantage of services -- the cold really is something that is dangerous , " he said			1
for all the continued problems , however , many residents and officials also could point to progress saturday			2
more public transit services were back running , fewer people were out of power , and even the days - long gas shortage showed signs of abating			1
" we need to continue to focus now on the next phase -- returning to normalcy , " @entity2 gov. @entity75 said			2
@entity1 gov. @entity79 said restoring electricity is the top priority , reiterating saturday that his state will hold utilities accountable if they were n't prepared for @entity20			1
more than 835,000 customers were in the dark statewide by mid-afternoon			1
@entity86 canceled one of @entity1 's top utilities , @entity89 , has restored power to all but 270,000 of its initially 940,000 customers affected by the storm , senior vice president @entity87 said			1
@entity31 praised that company , while blasting the @entity95 -- which services the @entity29 -- for not having " acted aggressively enough			2
" " we realize that @entity95 has outages throughout @entity101 , but the @entity29 were the hardest hit by the storm , " he said , adding that the utility indicated it could take two weeks to restore power there			2
" when it comes to prioritizing resources , we think they should be first in line			0
so far that has not appeared to be the case , and that is certainly not acceptable			0
" @entity95 did not immediately respond saturday night to @entity0 requests for comment on the mayor 's criticism			1
but the utility 's official @entity114 feed was active , with promises of extra crews and that 90 % of its customers should have power by late wednesday			1
both @entity31 and @entity79 praised the @entity120 for restoring 80 % of subway services in @entity1			1
the mayor said it should be up to 90 % by sunday			1
" not only did they try hard , but they got it done , " @entity79 said			0
powering cars and trucks is another issue , as evidenced by long lines at gas stations around the region			0
long gas lines test patience @entity75 noted that about 70 % of gas stations from @entity136 and points north were n't operating saturday -- not necessarily because they did not have gas , but because they could n't pump it due to power outages			1
( by comparison , about 95 % of stations south of @entity136 were working , he said			2
) in @entity147 on @entity1 's @entity101 , @entity146 said people were sleeping in their cars around 3 a.m. saturday , trying to be first in line once the pumps reopened			1
about eight hours later , lines were still about a quarter - mile long			0
" it seems that these long lines are everywhere you go , " said @entity146 , a @entity0 ireporter			0
still , a concerted effort in recent days to address the gas shortage appears to have yielded some positive results			0
whereas the @entity161 reported no gas in 67 % of metropolitan @entity1 stations on friday , the federal agency estimated that figure plummeted to 38 % on saturday			1
in addition to other sources again flowing into the region , the federal government announced friday night it would deliver 12 million gallons of unleaded gas and 10 million gallons of diesel to dispense around the hard - hit region			0
such fuel had already arrived at @entity173 and was being shipped out to stations , @entity75 said saturday			0
powerless in @entity2 the governor also singled out @entity176 , based in @entity177 , @entity2 , for distributing gas to rival companies whose stations had run dry			0
" that 's what @entity2 is all about , " he said			2
drivers in @entity1 and @entity101 , meanwhile , were able beginning saturday to fill up directly from 5,000 - gallon fuel trucks moving around the area			1
plus , homeland security secretary @entity187 issued a temporary waiver of the @entity189 , allowing oil tankers from the @entity191 to enter northeastern ports			0
on saturday , officials cheered developments on several fronts			0
with one small exception , the @entity197 and @entity2 is now open to all vessels , the @entity196 said			0
all water has been removed from the once - flooded @entity202 work site , said @entity79			0
nearly $ 28 million in federal disaster emergency grants have been allocated across nine counties , the governor added			0
migration to coast heightens impact of storms still , as millions can attest , headaches and heartache from @entity20 persist			0
the 900 - mile - wide superstorm left a huge swath of damage when it hit the @entity215 this week , claiming at least 106 lives in the @entity217 and two in @entity219 after earlier killing 67 around the @entity220			0
worst - hit @entity222 suffered 48 deaths , including 41 in @entity1 , authorities said			1
twenty of those were in @entity225			0
as communities grapple with the human toll , the price of the damage is stunning : between $ 30 billion and $ 50 billion , according to disaster modeling firm @entity231			0
that far exceeds the firm 's pre-storm estimate of $ 20 billion			2
the region may be in for more bad weather , with a weaker storm predicted for next week			0
but @entity75 , for one , is n't ready for that quite yet			0
" i know there are some forecasts of a nor'easter next week , " the governor said			0
" i ca n't believe it			0
" 7 health risks in the wake of the superstorm @entity0 's @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 and @entity251 contributed to this report			1
