@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity1 woman , blinded by a jilted stalker who threw acid in her face , has persuaded a court to sentence him to be blinded with acid himself under @entity11			1
@entity12 refused to accept " blood money			2
" she insisted instead that her attacker suffer a fate similar to her own " so people like him would realize they do not have the right to throw acid in girls ' faces , " she told the @entity16			1
her attacker , a 27 - year - old man identified in court papers as @entity25 , admitted throwing acid in her face in november 2004 , blinding and disfiguring her			1
he said he loved her and insisted she loved him as well			2
he has until early this week to appeal the sentence			1
doctors say there is no chance @entity12 will recover her vision , despite repeated operations , including medical care in @entity34 partially paid for by @entity1 's reformist former president , @entity35 , who was in power when the attack took place			1
@entity25 said he was still willing to marry @entity12 , but she ruled out the possibility and urged that he remain locked up			2
" i am not willing to get blood money from the defendant , who is still thinking about destroying me and wants to take my eyes out , " she told the court			2
" how could he pretend to be in love ? if they let this guy go free , he will definitely kill me			2
" @entity12 told the court that @entity25 's mother had repeatedly tried to arrange a marriage between the two after @entity25 met @entity12 at university			1
she rejected the offer , not even sure at first who the suitor was			1
her friends told her he was a man who had once harassed her in class , leading to an argument between them			1
but he refused to accept her rejection , she said , going to her workplace and threatening her			0
finally , she lied and told him she had married someone else and that " it would be better all around if he would leave [ her ] alone			0
" she told the court that she reported the conversation to police , saying he had threatened her with " burning for the rest of my life " -- but they said they could not act until a crime had been committed			1
two days later , on november 2 , 2004 , as she was walking home from work , she became aware of a man following her			1
she slowed , then stopped to let him pass			0
" when the person came close , i realized that it was @entity25 , " she said			0
" everything happened in a second			0
he was holding a red container in his hand			0
he looked into my eyes for a second and threw the contents of the red container into my face			1
" @entity12 knew exactly what was happening , she said			0
" at that moment , i saw in my mind the face of two sisters who years ago had the same thing happen to them			2
i thought , ' oh , my @entity98 -- acid			2
' " passers - by tried to wash the acid off @entity101 , then took her to @entity102			2
" they did everything possible for me , " she said of the doctors and nurses there			0
then , one day , they asked her to sign papers allowing them to operate on her			0
" i said , ' do you want to take my eyes out ? ' the doctor cried and left			0
" they did want to remove her eyes surgically , she learned , for fear they would become infected , potentially leading to a fatal infection of her brain			0
but she refused to allow it , both because she was not sure she could handle it psychologically , and because she thought her death would be easier for her family to bear			0
" if i had died , my family would probably be sad for a year and mourn my death , and then they would get used to it , " she told the court			0
" but now every day they look at me and see that i am slowly wasting away			1
" the three - judge panel ruled unanimously on november 26 that @entity25 should be blinded with acid and forced to pay compensation for the injuries to @entity12 's face , hands and body caused by the acid			1
that was what she had demanded earlier in the trial			0
but she did not ask for his face to be disfigured , as hers was			1
" of course , only blind him and take his eyes , because i can not behave the way he did and ask for acid to be thrown in his face , " she said			1
" because that would be [ a ] savage , barbaric act			0
only take away his sight so that his eyes will become like mine			0
i am not saying this from a selfish motive			0
this is what society demands			0
" attacking women and girls by throwing acid in their faces is sufficiently common in countries such as @entity158 and @entity159 that groups have been formed to fight it			1
human rights organizations have condemned the practice in @entity164 and @entity165			0
it is not clear how often such attacks take place in @entity1			1
@entity1 and @entity170 are the only countries that consider eye - gouging to be a legitimate judicial punishment , @entity169 has said			1
@entity2 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			2
