@entity0 -- monkeys and bananas			1
it 's as natural a pairing as squirrels and nuts or movies and popcorn			0
not any more , says one zoo in southwest @entity11			1
@entity12 in @entity13 is grabbing bananas out of its monkeys ' hands , giving them leafy veggies and sprouts instead			1
this is no monkey - business diet fad , though			2
the zoo says the high calorie and sugar content of bananas grown for human consumption -- which are sweeter than those found in the wild -- are bad for the monkeys ' health and can rot their teeth			1
" bananas grown for human consumption are full of sugar and calories , and bear no relation to fruit grown organically , " said zoo spokesman @entity32			1
" life in the wild is hard work and in a zoo you can sometimes look after the animals too well and it is n't good for their health			2
" @entity46 , better fur humans can continue gobbling up their bananas , just keep them away from monkeys			1
" sweet and juicy bananas are good for humans but not for monkeys , " @entity32 said			1
" animal nutrition has become a problem			0
@entity56 and monkeys is a bit of a cliche , but they 're not a good combination			2
" the zoo has not been able to find a supplier for the kind of wild - grown bananas that would be more suitable for the monkeys , he said			1
so , it decided it was time to put them back on the shelf			0
the zoo has seen " definite changes " in the monkey 's behavior since the bananas were slowly withdrawn from their diet , @entity32 said			1
" we 've noticed a net improvement in their coat and their fur is thicker and better			0
some of the smaller monkeys are less aggressive , " he said			2
@entity85 's annual ' monkey buffet ' diabetes risk according to the zoo 's head of conservation , @entity89 , the bananas ' high sugar content could cause the monkeys to develop diabetes or similar conditions			1
" it can also cause gastrointestinal problems as their stomachs are mostly adapted to eating fibrous foods with very low digestibility , " she said			0
zoos are getting smarter in the way they feed their captive animals			0
rather than throw in ready chopped and prepared food , many now try to make the animals " work " for their calories by searching for scattered foodstuffs or doing puzzles to release treats			0
this is just the next step , @entity89 said			0
@entity32 said there was no obvious sign that the monkeys were missing the fruit			2
in fact , they could well be happier without the extra sugar			2
" smaller monkeys such as tamarins and marmosets are highly strung animals and live in tight - knit social groups which can be quite aggressive at times , " said @entity121 , senior head keeper of mammals			0
" reducing the sugar in their diets has calmed them down and made their groups more settled			0
" @entity135 claims 2nd launch of monkey into space and back			0
