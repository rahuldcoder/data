@entity0 -- the @entity3 enrollment is 8 million strong and growing			1
polls have shown that voters love popular provisions calling for mandatory coverage for maternity care and extending coverage for young people up to age 26 to stay on their parents ' health insurance policies			0
and recent figures from the @entity14 show that @entity3 will cost about $ 5 billion less to implement in 2014 than originally estimated			2
still , some @entity16 have run from the president 's signature health care reform law so fast , they 've practically left skid marks			1
the question is : will they run back ? " i do n't think we should apologize for it			0
i do n't think we should be defensive about it			0
i think there is a strong , good , right story to tell , " president @entity26 said in a rare appearance thursday at the daily @entity29 news briefing			2
@entity26 : republicans ' were wrong ' about @entity3 a @entity16 strategist and pollster thinks some democrats will follow that advice			1
" i think it 's easier to talk about issues like equal pay or an increase in the minimum wage , " said @entity37 , president of @entity39 , a public opinion research firm in @entity0 , and a @entity42 contributor			0
" @entity3 has always been less popular			2
... i think we 're going to see some of these impressions change			0
but for some members , they look at one poll number and they think maybe i should speak about something else			0
" 2014 midterm elections obamacare a tough sell for embattled democrats singing @entity3 's praises is especially tough for politically vulnerable @entity16			1
so tough , in fact , that a @entity16 super pac , the @entity60 , ran ads for @entity62			1
@entity63 of @entity64 and @entity65 of @entity66 highlighting the lawmakers ' efforts in bucking the administration on some aspects of @entity3			2
the ads credit the lawmakers for " blowing the whistle " on the botched rollout of the @entity76 website			0
@entity78 groups and some wealthy donors are pouring millions of dollars into ad campaigns targeting @entity63 , @entity81 and other vulnerable @entity16 and trying to tie @entity3 to them			1
@entity16 super pac praises @entity84 for blasting @entity3 rollout the ads then go on to credit @entity63 and @entity81 for supporting provisions to block insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with preexisting conditions or dropping patients when they become ill. the ads do not , however , make clear that these popular provisions are a key part of @entity3			1
the @entity60 says their ads address @entity78 criticisms over @entity3			2
" vilifying @entity3 may make good sound bites for the @entity78 base , but candidates will be forced to answer tough questions about what dismantling the @entity3 really means for voters , " said @entity98 , the organization 's communication director			1
" poll after poll shows that people approve of the constituent parts of the legislation -- popular provisions @entity78 have vowed to repeal			0
" @entity63 was elected in 2012 and has voted numerous times against a full @entity3 repeal and for measures aimed at changing provisions in the law			1
@entity81 voted for @entity3 in 2010 , lost a re-election bid that year , and then won back her seat in 2012			2
democrats like @entity63 and @entity81 are trying to find artful ways to run on @entity3 , said @entity122 , the @entity16 strategist			1
those techniques include pointing out , " ' here are some things i might change or disagree with but it 's starting to work ' and talk about going forward how it 's going to work , " she said			0
treading lightly on @entity3 to be sure , there are reasons why some @entity16 feel skittish boasting about @entity3			1
from its inception , the partisan bickering over the law was acrimonious and led , in part , to the @entity138 - backed uprising that saw a number of @entity16 unseated and control of that chamber go to @entity78			1
despite a victory in 2012 , when the @entity144 @entity143 ruled core provisions of the law constitutional , @entity16 still found themselves on the ropes as @entity78 hammered them on the law 's failings and voted in the @entity29 for repeal " more than 50 times , " @entity26 pointed out thursday			1
last november , the @entity26 administration struggled to recover from the rocky rollout of the health care website and explain why the president broke a promise that people who prefer their insurance could keep it under the law			1
on the campaign trail , vulnerable democrats are dogged by questions about @entity3			1
@entity78 hit a nerve when it comes to @entity3 as he made his way this week through the chill and crowds at a southeastern @entity169 political gathering , sen. @entity164 was asked several times about the health care reform law			1
one man wearing an @entity174 sticker asked : " senator , did you read the @entity3 before you voted for it ? " @entity164 told the man : " i 've outlined a series of changes to it			2
" and in march , when @entity84 @entity183 lost by less than 2 % of the vote to @entity78 @entity185 in @entity64 's special election for the 13th @entity187 , the @entity78 said @entity183 was defeated in part by @entity3			2
" his ( @entity185 's ) victory shows that voters are looking for representatives who will fight to end the disaster of @entity3 , " @entity190 chairman @entity189 and co-chair @entity191 said in an e-mail to reporters after the candidate 's win			2
it is worth pointing out , though , that the seat has been held by @entity78 since the early 1980s			0
' this thing is working ' the president is aware that he is partly to blame for the nervousness surrounding running on @entity3			2
" there is no doubt that our failure to roll out the @entity3 smoothly has put a burden on @entity16 , whether they 're running or not , because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin , " @entity26 said at thursday 's news briefing			1
he added that he feels " deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier for them			0
" but , @entity16 strategists and political analysts say , it 's time for that party 's members to stop running from @entity3 and start proudly touting the law 's successes			1
failing to do so could cost the party in the long run , said @entity224 , a @entity225 historian and @entity1 contributor			0
" the party could make a collective mistake in continuing down this path , " he said			0
" generally , for most @entity16 , they need a message from the top saying they should not be responding to @entity78 attacks by saying ' we agree with you			0
' they need to point out the numbers and say we have some successes			0
" the president agrees , and he said as much on thursday : " this thing is working			0
" " i find it strange that the @entity78 position on this law is still stuck in the same place that it has always been			0
they still ca n't bring themselves to admit that the @entity3 is working , " @entity26 said thursday			1
" they said nobody would sign up ; they were wrong about that , " he continued			0
" they said it would be unaffordable for the country ; they were wrong about that			0
" @entity1 's @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this report .			0

despite @entity3 's successes , some democrats are *avoiding* being tied to the law
@entity26 , @entity16 *leaders* and party strategists say they think this is a mistake
politically vulnerable democrats are in an especially tough position on @entity3
more democrats might be willing to embrace the law 's wins in time , strategists say
