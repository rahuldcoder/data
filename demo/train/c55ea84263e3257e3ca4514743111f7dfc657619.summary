-- as political pros , journalists and pundits pick over exit polls to study how and why president @entity7 beat @entity8 for the presidency , a lot of the attention has been showered on the @entity11 turnout , gender gap and voters under 30			1
the @entity16 - @entity15 turnout has largely been overlooked , seen by prognosticators as a no - brainer for president @entity7			2
there was never any doubt he was going to receive the overwhelming majority of black support			0
in 2008 , @entity7 won 95 % of the black vote , with black women voting at a higher rate than any other group in the country			1
but six to nine months ago , numerous @entity7 campaign workers were privately expressing concern about the enthusiasm level of black voters , and about whether the massive 2008 turnout could be equaled			1
politics : what the election teaches us about ourselves they hoped registration efforts and get - out - the - vote drives would kick in at the right time			2
re-electing the first black president was clearly a motivating factor for @entity16 , but what also should be noted is the @entity45 's efforts to enact voter suppression laws			1
not only were black folks angered and shocked at @entity45 ' blatant attempts at voter suppression in @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and other states , they exacted revenge at the ballot box			1
conservatives have valiantly tried to assert that voter id laws , trimming the early voting days and even eliminating early voting on sundays was a prudent and practical decision that had nothing to do with black , @entity11 and young voters , or anyone else			0
opinion : the @entity45 's real problem is ideology but anyone with half a brain could see that the @entity45 was desperate to upend the coalition that proved so pivotal to @entity7 in 2008			1
all over the country @entity45 - led legislatures and governors rushed to pass voter id laws , only to see federal courts reject a number of them that clearly were n't thought through properly			1
in @entity51 , the voter suppression tactics were outrageous			2
after public pressure mounted to stop the practice of extending early voting in @entity45 - leaning counties and cutting them in @entity87 - leaning counties , @entity51 secretary of state @entity80 had no choice but to equalize early voting periods			2
such decisions , frankly , ticked off black activists , politicians , and civil rights groups to the point their voter registration campaigns went into overdrive			1
i talked to officials in multiple states , and the anger could be heard in their voices			0
social media played a role as every new voter suppression effort was exposed , setting off a litany of complaints			2
opinion : @entity45 routed by reality in @entity53 , @entity45 stopped allowing early voting on the sunday before @entity110 , with no explanation as to why			0
in 2008 , black churches marched a massive number of congregants to the polls , led by their slogan , " souls to the polls			0
" the @entity45 clearly did n't want to see that happen again			0
obstacles like these rekindled the feeling among many african - americans of the tactics enacted during the civil rights movement to keep blacks from voting			1
so pastors , deacons and laymen pushed and prodded their members to cast absentee ballots , and pushed hard for their members to stand in lines that during the early voting period can last as long as eight hours			0
in @entity51 , activists hit the salons , barbershops , recreation centers and churches to rally voters to do their civic duty			0
black radio stations were enlisted in the battle to protect the sanctity of the ballot			0
opinion : @entity7 's critics , repudiated at last even when the networks were calling the election for president @entity7 on tuesday , @entity53 residents were still standing in line to vote , some places in the rain , doing their part to push back			0
according to @entity158 president and ceo @entity159 , the organization registered 432,000 voters , a 350 % increase over 2008			1
the president 's reelection was n't about one group over another being the deciding factor			0
it was a collection of voters from varied backgrounds that made the difference			0
but the @entity45 should recognize and accept that its voter suppression tactics were not only roundly defeated , but were decimated			1
it was the late civil rights activist @entity171 who famously said , " i 'm sick and tired of being sick and tired			0
" black voters , and others , were sick and tired of the @entity45 trying to keep their votes from being cast by passing onerous laws , and they responded in an amazing way , matching the historic turnout of 2008 , and bringing to life the civil rights anthem , " @entity172			2
" opinion : how @entity45 can attract @entity11 voters the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : african - americans outraged by @entity45 attempts at voter suppression
anyone could see that @entity45 wanted to block @entity7 supporters , he says
registration campaigns went into overdrive , and voters exacted revenge , @entity185 says
the @entity158 registered 432,000 voters , a 350 % increase over 2008 , he says
