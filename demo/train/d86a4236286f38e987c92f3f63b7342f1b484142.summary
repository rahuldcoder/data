there was n't room for the two of them			0
in the fall of 2012 , with the presidential race in full swing , @entity5 gov. @entity4 and @entity7 gov. @entity6 , two prominent @entity9 governors with well - known national ambitions , were engaged in a different kind of campaign			1
behind the scenes , both men were aggressively jockeying for a plum political gig : the chairmanship of the @entity20 , a coveted post for any aspiring presidential candidate			1
the high - profile job would allow one of them to travel the country , gain a foothold in key states , and mingle with some of the @entity9 's leading financial backers -- all while controlling a nearly $ 150 million midterm political budget			1
previous @entity20 chairmen have used the post as a national launch pad : former @entity34 gov. @entity33 led the @entity20 in 2006 before his first presidential campaign , and @entity37 gov. @entity36 steered the committee in 2011 before embarking on his own @entity40 bid			1
@entity6 wo n't commit to serving full term in @entity7 ultimately , both @entity4 and @entity6 would each have a shot at running the @entity20 , @entity4 in 2013 and @entity6 in 2014			1
@entity6 , fresh off his re-election in @entity7 , formally took over the reins of the organization on thursday afternoon at its annual meeting in @entity48			2
@entity4 is transitioning to the role of vice-chairman			0
but before that line of succession was arranged , the tightly knit universe of @entity9 governors who comprise the @entity20 had to wrestle with an uncomfortable dilemma : @entity4 and @entity6 were both gunning for the committee 's top job in the same year -- 2014			1
next year 's midterm elections feature 36 gubernatorial contests , including three potentially competitive races in the early presidential caucus and primary states of @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
the @entity20 chairman will be a familiar face on television screens across the country and a constant point of contact for major donors			2
a successful 2014 cycle would be a gleaming resume point heading into the 2016 presidential cycle , which begins in earnest the moment polls close next november			0
@entity9 civil war could be brutal in 2014 the question of who would run the show in 2014 , @entity4 or @entity6 , was complicated by the organization 's lack of formal succession rules and @entity36 's unexpected resignation in late 2011 to run for president			1
when @entity36 stepped aside , @entity89 gov. @entity88 was suddenly thrust into the @entity20 's top job			1
@entity6 was elected vice-chairman , putting him in line to take over the @entity20 in 2013			1
@entity4 , a veteran member of the @entity20 's executive committee , was hoping to follow him in 2014			1
but that scenario did not sit well with @entity6 and his team of advisers for one glaring reason : he was up for re-election in 2013 , making it next to impossible to run the party committee while also campaigning for his own job in @entity7			2
the @entity7 's strict laws governing coordination between party committees made the prospect even more forbidding			0
where does @entity6 go next ? so with a flurry of phone calls and e-mails to his fellow governors , @entity6 charged ahead and launched a behind - the - scenes campaign to shake up the planned order of succession and take over the @entity20 in 2014 , multiple @entity9 sources told @entity117			1
@entity4 started whipping up his own votes			0
most of the @entity9 familiar with their efforts insisted that the brief but intense campaign for the 2014 job , which unfolded in september and october of last year , was collegial and far from rancorous			1
" the leadership teams for 2013 - 2014 were decided last year , " said @entity123 , the @entity20 's executive director			1
" continuity is a hallmark of @entity20 and governor @entity6 -- one of our party 's strongest national leaders -- will continue the strong stewardship of governor @entity4 and prior chairmen			1
" one senior @entity9 told @entity117 that the bout of campaigning was nothing more than " friendly competition " between the two governors			2
said another @entity9 , with a nod to the ambitions of both men : " there was a little back and forth			2
you know the personalities involved			0
" @entity144 's moment last ? one @entity9 operative familiar with the jockeying , however , said @entity4 and his team were " a little frustrated " by @entity6 's attempt to pry away a job that the @entity5 governor thought was rightfully his			1
" it just kind of took people by surprise , " said the operative , who , like most of the people who spoke about the maneuvering , declined to go on the record discussing internal committee business			0
" it came out of left field			0
it 's not how the organization was structured , really			0
the @entity20 had become a very congenial organization without a lot of internal politics			0
you do n't really shift things that are going well			0
@entity4 had paid his dues			0
was it a good move by @entity6 ? absolutely			0
it just rubbed some people the wrong way			0
" the campaigning grew intense enough that @entity88 fired off an a internal note to his fellow governors urging them to keep their eyes on a more pressing challenge -- the presidential election , then little more than a few weeks away			0
@entity6 to @entity9 : ' if being me is n't good enough , then fine , i will go home ' it soon became clear , though , that " @entity6 had the votes , " one person familiar with the whip effort told @entity117 , citing @entity6 's argument that it would be best for him to run the committee after securing re-election in @entity7			1
" it just made sense , " one neutral @entity9 source said			0
other @entity6 backers on the committee pointed to his ever - growing star power , arguing that his media profile and impressive fundraising acumen would be serious boons for the committee in a busy election year			1
as the dust began to settle in early october , @entity88 managed to broker a deal in which @entity4 would run the committee in 2013 , with @entity203 gov. @entity202 as his vice-chairman			0
@entity6 would take over the following year , with @entity4 as vice-chair			2
" the process worked itself out in a quick way and collegial way , " said one @entity9 with knowledge of the process			0
" it was a win - win , though it was probably a little more of a win for @entity6			2
" if there was any tension between @entity4 and @entity6 , it was n't apparent at a news conference wednesday in which @entity4 patted his successor on the back			0
" next year is a very important year for the @entity20 , " @entity4 told reporters in @entity48			2
" i think @entity6 is going to a great job			2
he 's going to do a great job raising money for the @entity20			1
i think he is going to a great job campaigning across the country for our incumbents and our challengers as well			0

high - profile job allows @entity6 to gain foothold in key states , mingle with @entity9 's big financial backers
previous @entity20 chairmen have used the job as a national launching pad
@entity6 launched behind the scenes phone and email campaign to shake up order of succession
@entity6 backers say his ever - growing star power will be boon for @entity20 in a busy election year .
