@entity0 -- joining " likes " on @entity4 , the social network has added dozens of new types of posts , including " bought , " " read " and " want			1
" sixty applications that let users publish information automatically to @entity4 launched at a news conference held at a trendy nightclub here on wednesday			1
many of these are new versions of existing online services or mobile apps			2
apps for foodies , like @entity20 and @entity21 , can publish to a user 's @entity4 profile when she updates her digital diary of meals			1
@entity26 can publish to @entity4 when customers buy concert tickets			1
like with @entity29 , the social network may create monthly personalized reports that are posted to a person 's profile showing how the app was used at any given time			1
for example , someone could see the places a friend traveled to last summer , thanks to @entity41			0
since the launch of @entity29 in september , participants such as @entity43 and @entity44 have reported large increases in membership			1
some 400,000 people coming from @entity4 have signed up for @entity43 accounts since september , and each day , @entity4 sends an average of 4,000 people who have never visited @entity43 before , @entity53 , the music company 's ceo , said in a phone interview			1
" the platform itself is the biggest traffic generator we 've ever had , " @entity53 said			0
" it is very significant			0
" facebook programmers have created a mathematical algorithm that will examine the types of posts a person has chosen to give prominent placement to on his or her profile , @entity4 cto @entity61 said in an interview			2
whether food , movies or exercises logged into @entity4 , the site will try to predict what you 're most passionate about based on past choices , similar to how the system determines its news feed based partly on the people you contact most often , @entity61 said			1
each user will be able to manually override these profile placements , he said			0
" people care a lot about the way their profile looks , " @entity61 said			0
these features are only available to those who have enabled the @entity90 , which opened to everyone about a month ago			2
eventually , every user will be required to use that version of the site profile			0
@entity61 described the new app features as part of a maturation of @entity4 , which goes beyond the initial perspective of its co-founder , @entity99 , who coded the website in his sophomore year at @entity102			1
@entity99 , who is now @entity4 's ceo , did not attend the event wednesday			2
" previously , the profile was all the things @entity99 was interested in in college , " @entity61 said			0
" you know , movies , music and books			0
" ( @entity99 , 27 , only lists one book on his @entity4 profile : @entity112 , which came out the year after he was born			2
) @entity4 will review each new action , as it 's called , that 's proposed by developers in order to screen for profanity or other unwanted words , @entity118 , the company 's platform engineering director , said in an interview			1
software developers will be able to create an unlimited number of these actions , he said			0
that would be useful for something like @entity127 , which allows users to " listen , " " watch " and " buy " things , although @entity130 is not participating in the program			0
a spokesman did n't respond to a request for comment			0
despite some early opposition , @entity4 wants to encourage all developers to adopt the new tools			1
" we 've got a whole new set , a whole new class , of applications that we think we 're enabling with this platform , " @entity138 , a @entity4 product director , said onstage during the announcement			2
" when we say anything , we really mean anything			0
" in characteristic @entity4 ambition , @entity138 added , " we 're even more excited about the thousands of apps to come			1

@entity4 is now letting all developers make apps that can automatically publish to profiles
the system will try to guess the *importance* of an app based on past activity
@entity29 was a *precursor* to these new features
