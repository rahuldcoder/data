the hundreds of theatergoers who packed into @entity3 's historic @entity2 on thursday night were expecting to watch a mystery			1
but about 40 minutes into the play , shortly after 8 p.m. , they got a drama instead			1
" one of the actors said , ' watch out ! ' " said one woman			1
" we thought it was part of the play			1
instead , it was part of the century - old structure 's ornate plaster ceiling , which tumbled five stories onto the theatergoers , injuring scores of them , seven seriously , officials said			1
" we heard a creak , somebody screamed , somebody from over there said , ' look out ! ' and then the ceiling kind of creased in the middle and then just collapsed , " said @entity23 , who with her husband had snagged one of the last pairs of tickets to the performance in the 775 - seat theater			1
though she said she herself felt " slight panic , " she credited those around her for keeping their calm			1
" it was n't every man for himself , " she said , noting that several of her fellow theatergoers checked on those around them			2
" everyone was looking out for each other , and in a couple of minutes , everyone was out			2
" the @entity52 's @entity51 manager @entity50 said about 720 people were inside when a section of the ceiling collapsed on the theatergoers , taking parts of the balconies with it			1
an ambulance official said a total of 76 people had been injured , though many of them were treated at the scene and released			1
" it was like slow motion , " said one girl , who initially thought the sound of the falling ceiling was sound effects , but soon learned otherwise			2
" it just kinda came down			2
" @entity50 said what fell was a 10 - meter - by - 10 - meter square section of the ceiling , and that it dragged down balconies with it			2
" you initially thought it was part of the play and then you could feel things on you , " said an older woman			2
" the dust that came down -- you could n't see in front of you			2
" @entity86 said those who were seriously hurt had been taken to hospitals in central @entity3			1
none of the injuries appeared life threatening , one official said			2
within an hour , a spokesman for the fire department said everyone , including those who had been hurt , had been evacuated from the building			1
@entity98 , who was with his wife and two children , said he thought the cave - in was part of the show until something very hard hit him on the head and chaos and panic erupted			0
" you could n't see across the room because of the dust , which we were all breathing in , " he told @entity108			0
" it was absolutely horrific and very terrifying			0
i was with my wife and two kids			0
thank @entity117 , we got out			0
" the @entity2 is located next to @entity118 in the @entity120 district , which is usually packed with tourists , shoppers and diners at theater time			0
within minutes , paramedics arrived carrying stretchers as police cordoned off the area			0
a few minutes later , some of the paramedics emerged from the theater , their stretcher full ; others helped someone limp out of the building			0
many of the injured were taken initially to the nearby theaters for an initial assessment of their condition by medical workers			0
the initial police assessment of the collapse was that it was an accident			0
" there is no suggestion at this stage that this was as a result of a criminal act , however , at this stage we are keeping an open mind , " @entity86 said in a statement			0
outside the @entity2 , the street was packed with dozens of police , fire and ambulance vehicles as well as well - dressed theatergoers , some of their faces darkened with dust			0
" @entity163 , " which was adapted to the theater from the 2003 mystery novel by @entity167 writer @entity166 , is about a 15 - year - old boy 's investigation into the death of a neighborhood dog			1
ticket prices at the four - level theater , which opened its doors in 1901 , included a Â£ 1 ( $ 1.64 ) " theatre restoration levy , " the theater 's website said			1
it was not immediately clear whether the ceiling was part of the restoration of the building , which is owned and operated by @entity179			1
in a statement , a spokesman said the company would " continue to cooperate fully with the authorities to establish exactly what happened tonight			0
" prime minister @entity186 , in a tweet , commended the fast work of emergency services			0
now , what started as a mystery and veered into drama has again become a mystery , as engineers try to determine what caused the collapse .			0
