-- since the july 3 military coup , @entity1 has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by @entity7 @entity6			1
@entity6 's recent presidential bid reveals a tenacious attempt of the @entity1 military to consolidate power and preclude @entity1 ' aspirations of having a genuine democracy			1
for the past few months , the @entity1 media and state institutions have been ardently working to pave the way for @entity6 's presidency by distorting and smearing his political opponents			1
over the past six decades , the @entity1 military has implanted its officers and generals in almost every aspect of civilian life from pasta and soap factories to the construction of soccer stadiums , bridges and infrastructure			2
through such practices the army has successfully extended its control over the country			0
consequently , the " militarization " of the @entity1 state , which was entrenched under @entity39 -- who systematically co-opted and spoiled military high - rank officers -- has weakened public institutions and created a feeble and fragmented political class that is now supporting the military 's takeover			1
@entity43 allies with regional support mainly from @entity45 and the @entity46 , who fervently seek to abort the @entity48 , @entity6 believes that he can suppress and tame the mounting anger and frustration among young @entity1 particularly @entity51 who protest almost daily			1
by pouring billions of dollars into @entity1 's economy , the @entity45 and @entity46 believe that they can appropriate the @entity1 army and use it as a trojan horse in order to eliminate and crush @entity51			2
indeed , @entity6 's @entity43 counterparts view him as a " savior " not only from @entity51 but more importantly from the very existential threat to their thrones : democracy			1
thus it is not surprising that both , @entity6 and his @entity43 allies , share the same authoritarian mindset and behavior			1
they desperately seek to restore @entity39 's ruling - style with a new face			0
surprisingly , or maybe not , the international community remains in limbo watching the manufacturing of a new dictatorship in @entity1 while doing nothing to prevent the possibility of such a scenario			0
' stability vs. democracy ' moreover , despite the many instances of violations of human rights and the killing of civilians in the absence of any justice or accountability , the world powers have done nothing to stop such repulsive actions			0
the @entity87 and the @entity88 have failed miserably in pressuring the military to separate itself from politics and return to the barracks			0
even as the @entity94 administration receives harsh criticism for its policies towards the @entity1 junta , secretary of state @entity92 seems keen not to anger @entity1 officials			0
not only has he praised the " roadmap " imposed by the military last july but he has also stated that " @entity1 [ are ] following the right path			2
" apparently , @entity87 foreign policy towards @entity1 's crisis continues to be driven by the long - standing delusional and misguided argument : stability vs. democracy			1
the @entity87 policymakers believe that @entity1 's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security			1
however , one must only look to the experience of the past eight months to see that this argument is nothing but a myth			0
simply , the level of violence and amount of killings and casualties is unprecedented in @entity1 's modern history			2
for example , the @entity121 , which represents around 6 % of @entity1 's land , is almost out of the central government 's control			2
and despite the ruthless security campaign there , militant islamists still pose a serious threat to @entity1 's national security			2
furthermore , the interior ministry has failed to secure its own facilities and vehicles			0
it is also struggling to protect its own personnel who are targeted by militant islamists			0
@entity138 explosion @entity6 , @entity1 's most likely post-coup president , will not be able to bring stability or security to the country			1
in fact , he has become a liability and an integral part of the problem not the solution			0
although he has garnered significant public support since the ouster of president @entity151 , there are no guarantees that @entity6 - mania will continue once he is president			0
the past three years have shown the volatility of the @entity1 public mood which can shift dramatically overnight particularly if @entity6 does n't quickly and appropriately fix @entity1 's ailing economic and societal problems			1
@entity1 is dangerously close to a social explosion due to unemployment , poverty and corruption			0
moreover , @entity1 is witnessing the largest waves of workers and professionals ' strikes since january 2011			0
with the absence of any coherent economic policy , @entity6 's presidency would n't be able to soothe the fears of many needy @entity1 who view him as a new @entity169			1
surely , @entity6 's @entity43 backers will likely continue their " lifeline " of support , at least for a while			1
this money could buy @entity6 some time but it will not certainly bring stability			1
history has shown that suppressing @entity51 only leads to more extremism and instability			0
during 1970s and 1980s the cases of @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity1 all served to provide appalling examples of @entity51 insurgency that would drain @entity6 and his regional backers			2
an el - @entity187 presidency would be a major cause for instability and insecurity in the region and would likely create more extremists and radicals			0
therefore , it is important that the international community , particularly the @entity87 and @entity88 , do not lend credibility to the bogus elections that will bring him to power			0
