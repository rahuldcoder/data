-- how many people can play the same video game ? not in the same video game , mind you , but play the exact same game at once ? with the help of a social - media robot , more than 80,000 people are currently trying			1
a version of " @entity9 , " a 1990s game for @entity12 's @entity11 , has been streaming on @entity13 , an online video platform devoted to gaming , for the past five days			1
a user known only by the gamer tag " @entity18 " set up the " social experiment " to accept chat commands as the equivalent of button pushes			1
you know , typing " up " moves your character up , " down " moves him down and whatnot			0
except that tens of thousands of other people are doing the same thing at the same time			1
the resulting movements of the main character have been spastic , to say the least			0
although the horde managed some success in the first few days , capturing several of those elusive @entity39 , the sheer number of people now tapping commands into @entity13 's chat window is causing the game 's main character , @entity40 , to wander back and forth over the same spot , bang into walls and check his inventory with neurotic frequency			1
the page has been viewed more than 10.6 million times , with the number of active users peaking at about 81,000			0
" this is one more example of how video games have become a platform for entertainment and creativity that extends way beyond the original intent of the game creator , " said @entity50 , vice president of marketing for @entity13			1
" by merging a video game , live video and a participatory experience , the broadcaster has created an entertainment hybrid custom made for the @entity13 community			2
" the modified game 's creator , whose real identity is unknown at this point , has implemented some features to cut down on trolling and help with coordination			1
the " start " command has been disabled , after people started spamming it into the chat , and the game now has " anarchy " and " democracy " modes that players can select via a virtual voice vote			1
" anarchy " is essentially the experiment 's original form , in which everyone 's command is applied immediately			2
in " democracy , " players are allowed to vote on their character 's next move			0
it takes a vote from 75 % of the players to switch modes , though			0
and you can imagine how easy that is			0
fans of the game have created their own subreddit , @entity39 fan art , progress tracking via a @entity101 document and a @entity103 feed			1
@entity13 hopes this inspires others to transform gaming into entertainment			0
" i did n't really have any plans for it from the beginning , " the creator said in an e-mail to gaming site @entity109			2
" i just wanted to put it up to see how people would respond			0
i put it together and put it up on a dedicated server all within a few days			0
" he , or she , has been keeping track of players ' progress , or lack thereof , and says it would be considered a win if they masses defeat the game 's @entity126 -- opponents who need to be bested before a final confrontation			2
" but i have my doubts about it being possible without much better coordination , " @entity18 wrote .			0

" @entity39 " has drawn tens of thousands of *followers*

" social experiment " has *spawned* @entity142 blog , fan art , @entity103 feed
