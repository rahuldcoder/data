@entity0 -- if the threat of underwear bombs became known last @entity5 , why did airport screeners only recently begin aggressively checking for them ? the answer is two-fold , @entity8 director @entity7 told reporters tuesday			1
first , the lack of a permanent leader at the @entity8 hindered change , he said			1
secondly , the agency needed time to train screeners on the new pat - down protocols			1
the threat of hidden bombs became instantly clear on december 25 , 2009 , @entity7 said , when authorities arrested @entity20 , a @entity21 man , after his failed attempt to ignite his hidden explosive on a flight from @entity24 to @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity8 officials immediately started looking at what they needed to do to modify technology or pat downs to detect the bombs , he said			1
but at that time , the top job at @entity8 was filled by a career official			2
the @entity34 delayed nominating a @entity8 chief and then @entity34 and congressional republicans feuded for a year over nominees			1
much of the debate centered on whether the nominees supported unionization of airport screeners			0
two of president @entity45 's nominees withdrew from consideration			0
" frankly it just came down to the fact there was not a presidentially appointed , @entity51 - confirmed administrator in place until i was confirmed at the end of june to make a really significant decision like that , that would have impact on a number of people , " @entity7 said			1
" that was a big part of it			0
" @entity7 was sworn in as administrator in july and soon thereafter made the decision to go through " enhanced pat downs			1
" training time accounts for the rest of the delay , as the @entity8 quietly began pilot programs in @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , @entity72 , in august , and rolled the program out nationwide in early november			1
@entity74 consistently has said it was his decision to implement enhanced pat downs			2
he said he opted not to publicize them in advance because he felt to do so would be to give a " roadmap " to would - be terrorists			0
implementation of the pat downs was further delayed because time was needed to train screeners on the new protocols , he said			1
those protocols are considered sensitive security information , and have not been shared with the public			0
but @entity7 said protocols do not allow for screeners to grope passengers			2
@entity7 said some passenger descriptions of the procedures are " so wildly outside the standard operating protocols that it just absolutely should not be happening			2
if it is , then we 'll take appropriate action			0
" " if we receive any complaints from a passenger about something happening , then we immediately follow up both with that passenger and with our security officers , " he said			0
most airport checkpoints have closed circuit television systems , which help investigators find out what happened , he said			0
videotape helped dispel one passenger 's complaint that she was handcuffed to a chair and mistreated , he said			0
" if there 's a security officer that did something that 's not appropriate , then we take appropriate action			0
i just want to make sure that i have all the facts , " @entity7 said .			2

the failed underwear bombing last @entity5 raised the threat of bombs hidden in clothes
@entity7 says after that , the pat - down program was delayed by two factors
the @entity8 lacked a permanent leader until july
extensive training also was required before implementation of the program , he says
