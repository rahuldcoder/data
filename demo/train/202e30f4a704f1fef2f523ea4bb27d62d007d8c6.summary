-- the @entity1 is trying to unravel a mystery : what is causing earthquakes in the town of @entity6 , @entity7 ? since september 20 , the community of 549 residents north of @entity10 has experienced an almost constant shaking from 487 measurable earthquakes			1
" we 've had 15 today including a 3.1 ( magnitude ) from this morning , " @entity12 , geohazards supervisor for the @entity1 , said monday			0
" these are shallow quakes between two and eight kilometers ( between one - and - a - quarter and five miles ) below the surface			2
" while earthquakes are n't unusual in the @entity20 state , the frequency is			1
" this time last year we had 39 quakes total for the entire state , " said @entity12			1
most of the quakes in the swarm -- a localized surge of earthquakes with all of them about the same magnitude , according to the @entity31 -- are so small they go unnoticed			1
the largest , a 4.0 on october 11 , caused the only documented damage , cracking a window at a visitor 's center to a state park			2
@entity6 mayor @entity37 said when the swarm first happened , citizens took notice			2
" they were calling @entity42 asking , " what are you going to do ? ' " he said			0
in response to the constant bombardment of tiny quakes , @entity37 's office has organized a three - hour long town meeting , and sought the help of state geologists and members of the oil and gas industry to find answers			1
" my wife wants to buy earthquake insurance			0
i 'm trying to talk her out of it , " the mayor said monday			0
there are several geologic faults in the area , but none associated with the @entity69 fault , the large seismic fault in the region and one that was the source of an estimated 7.0 - magnitude earthquake in 1811			0
and there was another historic flurry of earthquakes in 1982 , 15 miles south of @entity6			1
geologists know it as the @entity75 , responsible for 15,000 quakes within a year 's time , followed by more shaking in 2001			1
at first , town officials assumed the current wave of shakes came from work at a gravel company on the outskirts of town			1
@entity12 says the state geological survey has no idea whether the current swarm is a natural or man - made event , but his office is seriously exploring the latter			2
" we see no relation to the drilling in the area , but we have n't ruled out a connection to the salt water disposal wells , " he said			0
according to the @entity98 , there are at least a half dozen " disposal wells " within a 500 - square - mile zone around @entity6			2
licensed by the state of @entity7 , disposal wells are a byproduct of the oil and gas industry and are used to inject drilling waste water back into the earth after drilling			1
@entity12 said drillers inject waste water into the earth at high pressure , and in the area around the town the disposal wells go as deep as 12,000 feet			0
he points to incidents in @entity116 in the 1960s at @entity118 , where deep water injection was tied to earthquakes			0
last week the state of @entity7 issued a moratorium on new drilling permits			1
@entity123 , director of the @entity98 , said previously his office required only monthly reports outlining the operations of injection wells			0
" we 're asking well operators to provide daily reports now , " @entity127 said			0
@entity12 said his office is poring over the data trying to determine whether there is a correlation between the disposal wells and the shaking , and he hopes to present preliminary findings to the state next month .			0

the town of @entity6 , @entity7 , has been shaken by *hundreds* of small earthquakes
geologists have counted 487 measurable quakes since september 20
that 's almost equal to one per resident in the town of 549
state officials are *investigating* whether the quakes are natural or from industrial work
