-- @entity1 sits on the floor of his funeral goods shop surrounded by everything you could possibly want when you 're dead			0
there are paper versions of mobile telephones , suburban villas , even @entity10 and seafood platters -- all of them designed to be burned as funeral offerings			0
the ritual , a mixture of @entity16 and @entity17 customs , is meant to ease a spirit 's passage through the underworld			0
meanwhile , in the land of the living , making provision for the remains of the dead is one of crowded @entity28 's most contentious issues			1
soaring property prices , full cemeteries and increasingly limited space for cremated remains has given rise to a gray market in private columbaria for storing human ashes -- often in the middle of residential districts and sometimes of dubious legality			1
" i do n't blame these private operators at all , " @entity1 says from his shop in @entity28 's @entity42 district			1
" people are not going to stop dying and their ashes have to be stored somewhere			2
" @entity1 is one of the many operators of funeral goods and services that can often be found within a stone 's throw of the city 's public mortuaries			0
private columbaria operators approached by @entity0 would not comment for this article			1
" the government bears a big responsibility in all of this , " says @entity1 , as he glues beads to the mask of a @entity58 costume			2
" it is n't able to provide enough space for people 's remains , so how can it complain about the private operators who rise up to meet this need ? " should people just place ashes out in the street ? " @entity28 , however , is moving to control the industry			1
in september , the government published a list of 57 private operators as part of a name and shame campaign			2
it contends some are operating on the margins of legality , although it has stopped short of taking direct action against them			0
" we have cautioned consumers that they should know what type of columbarium they are buying , " says @entity28 health secretary @entity86 , whose department has published an a-list of legal operators and a b - list of operators who will need to apply for a government license			1
" the government is doing everything it can to regularise the supply of columbaria , " he told local media			2
" at the same time , there are certain areas where we will never be able to accept them , especially those in residential areas			0
" according to the @entity108 , 42,200 people died in @entity28 last year -- an average the department says will only increase over the coming decades as @entity28 's population ages			2
what to do with their remains lies at the intersection of @entity116 culture , big business and @entity28 's perennial quest for space			1
the conventions of @entity116 funerary culture are becoming harder to support in a city of 7 million people where , according to @entity126 figures , just 8 % of the land space is useable			1
@entity127 , a widespread tradition in @entity116 for several thousand years , has waiting times of as long as 56 months for a reused plot in a public burial site , according to government figures			1
long - held traditions of ancestor veneration mean that families often want a place to store ashes			1
this can cost as much as hk $ 200,000 ( us $ 25,704 ) in a private columbarium , but all manner of different deals are on offer depending on the location and the size of the niche			2
alternatives such as scattering the ashes are not popular , accounting for just 5 % of cremations each year , according to official figures			0
the government has canvassed alternatives such as constructing a large central columbarium on an outlying island off @entity28 , and even flirted with the idea of importing @entity156 technology for a mechanized facility			1
in these complexes , families swipe a smart card and the ashes of the deceased are lifted mechanically from an underground vault to one of 10 viewing areas			0
the most pressing factor in the debate , however , is that anything connected with the funeral industry has a massively negative effect on property prices in the vicinity			0
" i know someone who rents a 600 - square - foot flat in this area for as little as hk $ 3,000 a month , " says @entity173 , whose pest control business pre-dates many of the funeral shops that have come to the neighborhood over the past 20 years to take advantage of the proximity to one of @entity28 's largest public mortuaries			1
" you tend to get low - income residents here , taking advantage of the cheap rents , " he says			0
for many @entity116 people , urban cemeteries and columbaria carry powerfully negative feng shui -- a @entity116 system of beliefs related to living spaces and orientation -- and are regarded as dangerous places that link earth , heaven and the underworld			1
contact with cemeteries and grave sites form part of a highly structured set of rites , with visits generally limited to festivals such as @entity209 ( @entity210 ) or @entity211 when people pay their respects to their ancestors			0
while the government earlier this month announced that 40,000 new urn niches would be set up in @entity28 , new facilities are often resisted by residents whose wealth is tied up with their properties			2
some have engaged lawyers and complaints range from increased traffic problems and noise , to health problems associated with burning joss paper and incense			0
others have even cited climate change as a reason for closing down nearby funeral parlors where paper offerings are burned throughout the day			0
@entity173 says the not - in - my - backyard issue in @entity28 will not be resolved until a solution is found that benefits the government , the residents and the funeral industry			1
" these columbaria tend to be run by people with enormous wealth and power			0
while they are not in the same category as drugs and prostitution , they still operate in a gray area			0
you need a lot of money to invest in setting up a store , " he says , gesturing towards an unassuming office block opposite whose top two floors house urns containing cremated remains			1
competition in the funeral industry is intense and @entity28 is now losing ground to the nearby gambling enclave of @entity263 in the urn storage market , @entity173 says			2
alternatives are also appearing in @entity266 , across the @entity116 border , while some are even having their relatives ' ashes stored in the @entity271 , he added			1
for those still operating illegally in @entity28 , however , the pay - off can be worth the risk			2
" for an investment of tens of millions of dollars -- usually to rent , buy and renovate a property -- you can see a return of a billion dollars very quickly , " @entity173 says			0
@entity279 contributed to this report			0

@entity28 running out of space for burials and even places to store cremated remains
private columbaria - places where ashes are stored - have sprung up but many are illegal
the government is seeking to control the *unregulated* , but highly *lucrative* , industry
a @entity116 culture of ancestor veneration means few are willing to have the ashes of relatives scattered
