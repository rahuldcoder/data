-- why leave home when you can send out a sexy , stylish robot version of yourself to do anything you tell it ? in " surrogates , " lifelike robots take the place of humans in day - to - day life			1
that 's the world of " surrogates , " a film starring @entity14 that opens friday			0
@entity14 plays an @entity16 agent who investigates the first murder to occur in years in a world where no one worries about crime or pain , because their robots self - heal with a quick reboot			1
far - fetched science fiction ? sure			0
but scientists and the movie 's makers say the technology might not be as far away as most people think			1
armies use remote - controlled robots to attack enemies and destroy land mines			1
emerging technology for the disabled allows users to operate robotic limbs and control computer cursors without touching a keyboard			2
and emerging " telepresence " technology is letting people see , hear and , increasingly , walk , talk and gesture using human - sized robots a world away			1
" there are a lot of real - world components to this , " said robotics expert and author @entity49 , whose books like " where 's my @entity55 ? " and " @entity56 " explore the intersections between science fiction and real science			2
" clearly , there are not fully functional humanoid robots ... but there are a lot of components to telepresence that already exist			1
" " @entity69 " director @entity66 , whose film credits include 2003 's " @entity68 : @entity68 , " said he was drawn to the concept of surrogate robots as an extension of current technology			1
and , he said , as he met with scientists , he became convinced that something approaching the concept could one day be a reality			2
" to me , it 's not even a question of the technology			2
technology always catches up , " he said			2
" the question is , is some universal human urge being met by this invention ? it seems to me we have a fundamental human desire to be lazy , to sort of not have to do things in person and to do it remotely			0
" that began with the telegraph and the telephone and has morphed into the @entity94			0
" the first steps down the road are being taken at @entity97 , a @entity98 , @entity99 , company founded in 2001 by @entity101			1
the company offers , for about $ 30,000 , a 5 - foot - tall , 35 - pound robot that allows the user to remotely travel , see , hear and talk			1
it hopes to release its latest version of the robot at a more affordable price			2
the robot 's vaguely humanoid curves , roughly adult height and ability to move around using technology similar to that of the @entity114 are important steps up from current teleconferencing technology , @entity101 said			1
anybots in the development phase are being designed to run , jump and climb stairs , and they come equipped with fully articulated hands designed to perform increasingly human - like tasks			1
@entity101 said he 's not sure the technology will ever advance to the level imagined in " @entity69 " -- but that may have as much to do with desire as ability			1
" i do n't know if we 'll ever get quite to that level , of being that realistic , " he said			0
" most of the time , you 're not trying to fool people ; you 're just trying to make something human enough so people can relate to it			0
" @entity49 , who said he appreciates " @entity69 " because it avoids sci - fi 's traditional " man vs. machine " dynamic , also imagines social reasons for not pursuing such technology			1
" would humans stand in line at the grocery store behind a robot ? would i let my children play outside if i knew there were robots outside walking dogs ? " he said			1
it 's more realistic , @entity49 said , that a humanoid robot could be created to remotely perform tasks that would be too dangerous for the machine 's operator to do			2
although @entity153 employs robots in space , the highly technical work often required for space walks still requires a human touch -- at least for now			2
plus , he said , making robots that look and act like us would help them function better , he said			0
" another major reason to create humanoid robots is , they can use all of our tools , " @entity49 said			0
" human beings have taken large chunks of the planet and completely transformed the environment to support our embodiment			0
doorways are a certain width all over the world because human beings are about the same size			0
all our tools are similar because we 've all got hands and thumbs			0
" for @entity180 , the movie also reflects technological advances that , for better or worse , exist as the world of online networking continues to grow			0
" you can do your shopping			0
you can get your news			0
you can let everyone know what you 're up to , " he said			0
" for those who telecommute , you do n't even have to put your clothes on to go to work			0
" this idea basically just takes that to its logical conclusion			1

in " @entity69 " sexy , stylish robots live life for their owners
scientists say " telepresence " with robots is real , will improve
@entity99 company @entity97 developing robot that can jump , climb stairs
director : androids are " logical conclusion " of technology that already exists
